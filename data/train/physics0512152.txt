    "modern intense ultrafast pulsed lasers generate an electric field of sufficient strength to tunnel ionize one or more valence electrons from an atom .",
    "such processes are generally treated as a rapid succession of isolated events , in which the states of the remaining bound electrons are unrelated to the preceding ionization events .",
    "while such a description has been shown to be more than adequate at predicting single , and in certain cases double ionization , a number of recent experimental studies have indicated the necessity to consider more than one active electron @xcite . in the current study , we present evidence for the existence of indirect non - recollisional excitation of the bound valence electrons during tunnel ionization ( ti ) .",
    "the foundation of the modern theoretical description of intense ac - field nonlinear photoionization was laid by keldysh @xcite , who derived the dependence of the rate of ti on the frequency and strength of the optical field and the binding energy and quantum state of the ion and electron : for a detailed review see @xcite . in the ultrafast regime ( optical pulse duration of the order of femtoseconds , 1 femtosecond = 10@xmath2 s ) ,",
    "the ionization of an atom is either a perturbative process ( peak intensity less that approximately 10 tw@xmath0 where 1 tw = 10@xmath3 w ) , or a strong - field process , described by tunnel theory . in the present work , we concern ourselves purely with the strong field regime .    immediately following ionization",
    ", the liberated electron is in a modified volkov state @xcite , and is initially fully correlated with the parent ion .",
    "the electron is driven on a trajectory defined by the ellipticity of the laser radiation and the optical phase at which ionization occurred .",
    "an intriguing phenomenon in the strong field regime is that of _ recollision _",
    "@xcite whereby electron impact excitation @xcite or further ionization @xcite can arise in a linearly polarized laser pulse , which drives electron(s ) back to the parent ion .",
    "the coltrims technique @xcite has recently been employed to great effect to investigate these mechanisms .",
    "recollision is the key mechanism for coherent attosecond xuv pulse generation @xcite , whereby energy absorbed by the electron from the field is dissipated photonically upon recombination with the parent ion .",
    "tunnel theory , often the popular adk form @xcite , is unable to quantify recollision , however by treating recollision ionization ( ri ) as ti from the previous charge state , albeit with a suppressed efficiency , an adequately accurate numerical solution may be found @xcite .",
    "ri can be treated in a more physically robust manner either through intense - field many - body _",
    "s_-matrix theory @xcite or time - dependent density functional theory @xcite .",
    "the time - dependent solution of the schrodinger equation @xcite provides the most accurate description of the process at the expense of only being applicable to two - electron systems and then with a massive computational overhead .    in the present work",
    "however , we have made ri events extremely unlikely by employing circularly polarized light . in undergoing tunnel ionization ,",
    "an atom must absorb a large number of photons @xcite which , when absorbed from a circularly polarized laser pulse , transfer considerable angular momentum to the liberated electron , dramatically reducing the probability of returning to the ionic core , i.e. the impact parameter will be very large . in terms of the laser - induced electric field ,",
    "following ti , the field drives the free electron on a spiral path : the pitch of the spiral is defined by the temporal envelope of the pulse . as the pulse intensity increases",
    ", the electron is rapidly removed from the vicinity of the ion . by negating recollision processes , the masking effects of electron - impact excitation and ionization",
    "are removed , revealing the existence of a new laser - induced excitation mechanism .",
    "while ionization in ultrafast laser pulses is well documented , minimal theoretical and essentially no experimental studies have investigated the possibility of simultaneous excitation of the parent ion during ti . the contemporary work of zon @xcite introduced the idea of ` inelastic tunnelling ' whereby the parent ion can be left in an excited state following the ionization of one of @xmath4 identical valence electrons .",
    "the excitation process is through ` shake - up ' , first employed by carlson @xcite to explain single uv photon absorption leading to the ionization of a first electron with the excitation of a second electron .",
    "the ionization event diabatically distorts the bound electron wavefunctions , resulting in the excitation of a bound electron .",
    "zon @xcite and kornev _ et al _ @xcite have derived a general expression for the rate of ti of an atom with simultaneous excitation of the lowest lying ionic states .",
    "this derivation relies on the sudden approximation , valid in the case of ultrafast ti as the ionization potential is far greater than the excitation energy of the ion .",
    "the range of excited states of kr@xmath5 ( @xmath6 = 2 to 6 ) considered is consistent with this approximation , modifying the probability of ionization significantly .",
    "furthermore , it is also necessary to allow for all combinations of excitation + ionization to some final charge state after the laser pulse has finished , irrespective of whether it is a ground or excited state .",
    "to distinguish such processes from standard sequential ti , we refer to such processes as multi - electron tunnel ionization ( meti ) .",
    "this distinction is necessary , as eichmann _",
    "et al _ @xcite have previously proposed a mechanism of collective tunnel ionization ( cti ) , whereby two electrons can simultaneously tunnel away from the atom .",
    "this process was predicted to only arise if the tunnelling electrons have highly correlated momenta , otherwise recapture of one of the electrons would occur ; this requirement results in a very low probability .",
    "in general , previous experimental measurements of ion yield as a function of laser intensity are unavoidably a convolution of the probability of ionization with the focal volume producing the signal @xcite . by simply changing the energy of the laser pulse",
    ", the spatial distribution of laser intensity also changes , resulting in the characteristic @xmath7 response at intensities above saturation , the so - called ` volume variation ' problem . while most apparent above saturation , there is also an intrinsic volume dependence below saturation , which subtly modifies the gradient of the ion yield .",
    "frequently , the complexity of this situation is compounded by diffraction associated with the spatial profile of the laser ; a direct comparison with theory being made impossible without introducing the specific experimental geometry . through a contemporary method by bryan _",
    "et al _ @xcite , developed from the pioneering work of walker _",
    "et al _ @xcite and analogous to the tomographic technique of goodworth _",
    "et al _ @xcite , we circumvent this hinderance .    a novel solution to the volume variation problem",
    "was proposed by van woerkom and co - workers @xcite : by softly focusing a high - energy ultrafast laser pulse into a tightly apertured photoion detector , only those ionization states generated within a narrow spatial ( and therefore intensity ) window are detected . by translating the focusing optic , this restricted range of observed laser intensities may be accurately manipulated .",
    "up to six - fold ionization of krypton saturates at intensities less than 10 pw@xmath0 , and the 30 mj 790 nm 50 fs laser pulses generated by the astra laser facility ( uk ) need only be softly focussed ( _ f_/11 optics ) to generate a peak intensity in excess of 100 pw@xmath0 .",
    "indeed the active range of the focused astra beam extends over tens of millimetres . by limiting the spatial acceptance of our ion time - of - flight mass spectrometer to 250 microns ,",
    "the ion yield is strongly dependent on the position of the optical focus with respect to the spectrometer . by recording the relative ion yield of kr@xmath8 ( @xmath9 = 1 to 6 ) while translating the focusing optic in 125 micron steps , the intensity selective scan presented in figure 1",
    "is measured @xcite . throughout this measurement ,",
    "the krypton gas pressure is low enough so as to avoid space - charge effects , tested by repeating the intensity selective scan ( iss ) measurements as a function of pressure . at higher number densities ,",
    "space - charge effects are apparent as a loss of ion yield definition both in time - of - flight and focal position .",
    "( _ n _ = 1 to 6 ) generated at the focus of a 50fs 790 nm circularly polarized laser pulse .",
    "the 2000-laser shot average ion yield is recorded with an apertured time - of - flight mass spectrometer as the focusing optic is translated parallel to the direction of propagation .",
    "the six most abundant isotopes are clearly resolved.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    at this point , we wish to stress the importance of identifying background contaminants in the iss data . in previous studies on argon @xcite ,",
    "such an incumbrance is not present , as argon has three naturally occurring isotopes @xmath10ar , @xmath11ar and @xmath12ar with abundances of 0.33% , 0.06% and 99.60% respectively , which do not suffer from significant charge - to - mass degeneracy with any possible atmospheric contaminants ( greater than 0.1% yield ) .",
    "krypton however has six main isotopes @xmath13kr , @xmath14kr , @xmath15kr , @xmath16kr , @xmath17kr and @xmath18kr , with natural abundances 0.35% , 2.28% , 11.58% , 11.49% , 57.00% and 17.30% respectively .",
    "the high charge - to - mass ratio resolution of our spectrometer allows selective ion yield integration over those isotopes not degenerate with background contaminants .",
    "an example is the kr@xmath19 peak in figure 1 : @xmath17kr@xmath19 is degenerate with n@xmath20 .",
    "ionization to n@xmath20 requires a far lower intensity than @xmath17kr@xmath19 , apparent in figure 1 as the faint ion yield extending to large distances from the focus . to recover the probability of ionization , the non - degenerate isotopes ( 78 , 80 , 82 and 86 ) are integrated with respect to flight time , thus the spatially dependence of the ion yield is measured .    to make the iss measurements directly comparable with theoretical predictions , we remove the spatial integration through a deconvolution @xcite or inversion @xcite technique , requiring the measured ion yield and theoretical on - axis intensity as a function of focal position as inputs .",
    "the resulting partial probability of ionization ( ppi ) @xcite is independent of the effects of varying signal - producing volume .",
    "the unavoidable diffraction of the laser pulse is also accounted for by solving the collins form @xcite of the huygens - fresnel diffraction integral @xcite .",
    "the enhancement of detector gain with charge state ( quantum efficiency ) is also quantified .",
    "the ppi is therefore equivalent to the response of a single atom to a spatially infinite laser focus , as we have removed _ all _ instrumental dependence .",
    "the ppi results are valid up to saturation , however at higher intensities the deconvolution breaks down , thus the ppi is then defined as unity .     ( _ n _ = 1 to 6 ) as a function of laser intensity recovered from the iss data presented in figure 1 . the deconvolution of a non - gaussian focal volume as detailed in bryan _",
    "et al _ @xcite results in a ppi which is independent of the spatial distribution of laser intensity across the laser focus .",
    "the ppi at which saturation occurs relative to the ppi of kr@xmath21 is proportional to the quantum efficiency of the detector .",
    "the values in parenthesis in the legend indicate the relative efficiency for each charge state.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    the raw ppi(_n _ ) for kr@xmath8 ( _ n _ = 1 to 6 ) results are presented in figure 2 .",
    "the influence of the variation of quantum efficiency of our detector is apparent from the increasing ppi(_n _ ) at which saturation occurs with increasing ion charge state . in figure 2 , the values in parenthesis in the legend are the quantum efficiencies relative to the ppi of kr@xmath21 . if the ppi(_n _ ) for kr@xmath8 ( _ n _ = 1 to 6 ) presented in figure 2 is divided by the quantum efficiency , all ppi(_n _ ) saturate to unity at high intensity .",
    "( _ n _ = 1 to 6 ) by a 50fs 790 nm circularly polarized laser pulse .",
    "all influence of both the optical or detector geometry has been removed , allowing a direct comparison with the predictions of kornev _ et al _ @xcite . in all frames ( a ) to ( f ) , the thin line is traditional sequential ti ( adk @xcite ) prediction , while the thick line is the cpi for multi - electron tunnel ionization ( meti ) including an allowance for excitation to low lying states .",
    "the remarkable agreement illustrates the breakdown of tunnel theory , particularly for triple ( c ) or higher order ionization , where the agreement between the measured cpi and the meti prediction indicates the presence of excitation.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    if the quantum efficiency of the detector is removed , such that the ppi(_n _ ) are now normalized , the break down of the deconvolution routine at intensities greater than saturation can be addressed by conserving the probability of ionization .",
    "consider the ppi(_n _ ) for _ n _ = 1 , 2 as shown in figure 2 . at low intensity , ppi(1 ) is small , and increases with intensity up to saturation at an intensity of 200 tw@xmath0 .",
    "however , as is often the case in atomic ionization , ppi(2 ) is nonzero at this intensity .",
    "the condition for conserving probability is that the sum of probabilities is less than unity below the saturation of ppi(1 ) or equal to unity at higher intensities , thus at an intensity greater than 200 tw@xmath0 , the conserved probability of ionization to kr@xmath21 , cpi(1 ) must be less than unity as ppi(2 ) is nonzero .",
    "this definition is extended to an _",
    "electron system in the present work and is only valid following the removal of the quantum efficiency .",
    "a direct comparison between the theoretical predictions of kornev _ et al _ @xcite and the present volume - independent cpi is presented in figure 3 .",
    "all theoretical curves presented are universally normalized in intensity to the experimental data . in all frames of figure 3 ,",
    "the sequential adk prediction is the thin line , and the multi - electron tunnel ionization ( meti ) predication is the thick line . in figure 3(a ) , neither the adk or meti predictions represent the kr@xmath21 cpi : this is due to a contribution from multiphoton ionization ( mpi ) at sufficiently low intensities to access the perturbative regime . at intensities close to the saturation of kr@xmath21 , it can be seen that both adk and meti describe the cpi adequately .",
    "a similar low intensity response is observed in figure 3(b ) ( kr@xmath22 ) , where again around 100 tw@xmath0 mpi contributes .",
    "however , as the intensity increases , the meti prediction is in much better accord with the experimental data , reproducing the cpi far more closely than adk . the superiority of agreement with meti over adk is dramatically illustrated for ionization to kr@xmath19 , kr@xmath23 and kr@xmath24 , figure 3(c ) to ( e ) , particularly high intensity kr@xmath19 and kr@xmath23 at all intensities .",
    "indeed , at an intensity of around 1 pw@xmath0 , adk theory underestimates the cpi of kr@xmath23 by more than an order of magnitude . at the highest intensities discussed in the present work , ionization to kr@xmath25 , figure 3(f )",
    "is well described by both adk and meti , however the latter is still observed to give the better agreement . throughout figure 3 , it is apparent that meti generates an excellent quantification of the cpi of krypton by circularly polarized 50 fs laser pulses .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the excitation of the bound valence electrons in the atomic ion .",
    "the shake - up mechanism invoked in both the present work and @xcite is the subject of ongoing interest , see for example the recent review by becker _",
    "et al _ @xcite : shaking can only cause excitation at high intensities , as the energy of the departing electron must be sufficient to excite other residual electrons .",
    "this is supported by the present work : there is no significant excitation until around 1 pw@xmath0 .",
    "et al _ @xcite predict many orders of magnitude difference between the recollision yield and shake up contribution . however , here the recollision contribution is negligible . in qualitative terms",
    "the high degree of agreement between the measured cpi and the meti prediction is a result of ( i ) the high intensity laser - induced population of low - lying excited states through diabatic shake - up excitation , ( ii ) the removal of recollision excitation or ionization through the use of circular polarization .",
    "furthermore , this observation would not be possible without the measurement of the geometry - independent ppi and the realization of conservation of probability .",
    "the pertinent question raised by the present work is why has this mechanism not been observed before ?     for _",
    "n _ = 1 to 6 as compared to the volume - scaled predictions of kornev _ et al _ @xcite , illustrating how ionization - induced excitation could be more difficult to identify from traditional intensity variation measurements . as in figure 3 , the thin line is traditional sequential adk prediction , while the thick line is multi - electron tunnel ionization ( meti ) prediction , allowing the generation of excited states by ionization.,title=\"fig : \" ] +",
    "in figure 4 , we present the ppi(_n _ ) to kr@xmath8 for _ n _ = 1 to 6 , however in contrast to figure 2 , the ppi for each ionization state is scaled by the volume of the laser focus generating the signal .",
    "this is easily quantified , as the deconvolution route requires the precise computation of the spatial distribution of intensity , as described in @xcite .",
    "figure 4 also contains the volume - scaled meti predictions @xcite .",
    "as is expected , the observations of the previous section are still applicable , however it is now far more difficult to isolate which model applies above saturation .    comparing figures 3 and 4 ,",
    "we illustrate how subtle differences between the volume - scaled ppi and either theoretical prediction could be missed in a traditional intensity - variation measurement ( equivalent to figure 4 , for example see @xcite ) .",
    "if the detector efficiency is unknown , the measurement of which is by no means trivial , the effect of excitation could conceivably be overlooked as a manifestation of detector efficiency or could be ignored if the adk curves are normalized independently . as apparent from figure 4 , excitation is manifest as a major vertical shift in apparent yield , and a minor variation in intensity response .",
    "furthermore , a number of experimental studies have commented on the inadequacy of tunnel theory ( specifically the adk treatment @xcite ) , without concrete discussion of why , nor the suggestion of a mechanism by which tunnel theory might be breaking down .",
    "it is hoped that the present work allows previous experimental data to be re - examined in terms of the ionization - induced excitation mechanism .",
    "we present for the first time strong evidence for the presence of considerable atomic excitation during tunnel ionization of krypton by a 790 nm 50fs circularly polarized laser pulse focused to intensities in excess of 10 tw@xmath0 .",
    "the polarization of the radiation is such that recollision excitation and ionization are essentially negated . the impressive agreement between the measured conserved probability of ionization and recent theoretical predictions",
    "indicate that excitation during ionization need be considered irrespective of recollision processes .",
    "excitation is due to the intense laser field energetically removing valence electrons : during these tunnel ionization events , the wavefunctions of the remaining electrons is impulsively distorted .",
    "such excitation is also expected to occur in a linearly polarized laser field , and , as the results of kornev _ et al _ @xcite suggest , is expected to be even more important in a 5fs laser pulse .",
    "this has a major bearing on the emerging field of optical attosecond physics .",
    "the influence of initial and transitionary electronic states accessed through intra - pulse excitation must be quantified to accurately predict the energy of the emitted photons .",
