    "the standard model of cosmology is remarkably successful in accounting for the observed features of the universe .",
    "however , there remain a number of fundamental open questions at the foundation of the standard model .",
    "in particular , we lack a fundamental understanding of the acceleration of the late universe @xcite .",
    "in fact , the standard model of cosmology has favoured dark energy models , involving time - dependent scalar fields , as fundamental candidates responsible for the cosmic expansion . indeed",
    ", scalar fields naturally arise in particle physics , including string theory , and in addition to this , the underlying dynamics in inflationary models depend essentially on a single scalar field , with the inflaton rolling in some underlying potential @xcite .",
    "a plethora of candidates exist for dark energy , and we refer the reader to @xcite for a review .    in a cosmological context , the mathematical properties of the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) models with a scalar field as a matter source have also been extensively investigated .",
    "for instance , in mus , sal a simple way of reducing the system of the gravitational field equations to a first order equation was proposed , namely , to the hamilton - jacobi - like equation for the hubble parameter @xmath2 considered as a function of the scalar field @xmath0 . in fact , a number of integrable one  scalar spatially flat cosmologies , which play a natural role in the inflationary scenarios , were studied in @xcite .",
    "recently , a general method for the study of scalar field cosmologies , based on the reduction of the klein - gordon equation to a first order non - linear differential equation , was proposed in @xcite .",

    ", we obtain for @xmath9 the riccati type equation @xmath10 , which is easily integrable .",
    "the riccati equation based study of the different properties of the isotropic frw type cosmological models was performed in @xcite .",
    "in fact , the integrability conditions of the riccati equation obtained in @xcite allow the integration of the structure equations of isotropic general relativistic compact objects mhs in the context of general relativity .",
    "furthermore , the applications of the riccati equation to stellar and cosmological models have been extensively discussed in the literature , and we refer the reader to mh6,mh3,mh4,mh5,u1 . very recently , using the chiellini type integrability condition for the generalized first kind abel differential equation , consequently , the new class of exact analytical solution of the riccati type equation has been obtained in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the theoretical investigation of scalar field models is an essential task in cosmology .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to explore alternative approach in solving the cosmological gravitational field equations in the presence of self - interacting scalar fields , based on the mathematical analysis of the riccati type equation that gives the hubble function in terms of the scalar field potential .",
