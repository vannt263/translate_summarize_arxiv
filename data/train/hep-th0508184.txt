    "in particular , in ref . @xcite it was shown that there are two branches of nonextremal enhanon solutions consistent with the supergravity equations of motion ; one is referred to as the shell branch because it exhibits a shell similar to that of the enhanon , and the other as the horizon branch because it has no shell , but a regular horizon .",
    "it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that the shell branch solution violates the weak energy condition ( wec ) , and therefore only the horizon branch is physically viable .",
    "however , there is a mass gap between the extremal enhanon solution and the extremal limit of the horizon branch solution , and so a puzzle is presented - what is the form of the nonextremal enhanon whose mass lies within this mass gap ?",

    "our results are in contrast with those of ref .",

    "this singularity is resolved in string theory by the enhanon mechanism , which says that the supergravity solution inside a certain radius @xmath17 , the enhanon radius , should be replaced by flat space ( see ref .",
    "the enhanon radius is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the volume of the k3 manifold at the enhanon radius .",

    "the exterior expressions for the dilaton and r - r fields are given by @xmath25 the harmonic functions @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath26 are now given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath0 is the nonextremality parameter of the branes ( the extremal limit is @xmath29 ) .",
    "there are two choices for @xmath30 consistent with the equations of motion @xmath31 @xmath21 and @xmath20 in and are still given by .",
    "the choice of a plus sign in @xmath30 implies that @xmath32 .",

    "this solution has a horizon at @xmath33 , and is therefore known as the horizon branch . on the other hand",
    ", the choice of a minus sign in @xmath30 implies @xmath34 , and therefore the corresponding solution has a repulson singularity , which is corrected by an enhanon shell at @xmath35 , where @xmath17 is given by ( see ref .",

    "@xcite it is claimed that the shell branch solution has @xmath43 , and is therefore unphysical , whenever the supergravity solution is valid , i.e. whenever @xmath44 .",
    "we will discuss our results regarding this issue in the next section .",
    "we will show in this section that the wec is not violated for small enough values of the nonextremality parameter @xmath0 . to motivate this calculation we have plotted in figure [ fig : energy_density ] the expression for @xmath45 from equation for small values of @xmath0 , taking @xmath46 and @xmath47 . at @xmath48",
    "we find @xmath49 , as expected , and when @xmath0 is small we find @xmath50 .    as was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the supergravity solution is only relevant when @xmath44 .",
    "we will therefore proceed by expanding all expressions in powers of @xmath51 .",
    "we take @xmath0 to be of the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 is independent of @xmath51 and @xmath54 .",
    "we will assume that the parameter @xmath21 , given in equation , is of order unity in the @xmath51 expansion , and we use equation to express @xmath20 in terms of @xmath21 .",
    "then expanding the expressions ( with the minus sign ) for @xmath30 and for @xmath55 yields @xmath56 where @xmath57 using these expressions in the formulae for @xmath17 and for @xmath12 and @xmath26 we find @xmath58 substituting the equations and into the expression for the energy density @xmath45 , we find @xmath59    it remains to show that this expression for @xmath45 is positive for some range of values of the parameter @xmath53 .",
    "the overall factors in are positive since @xmath60 , so we ignore these in what follows . then setting @xmath61 , and pulling a factor of @xmath21 out of @xmath45",
    ", we can write to leading order @xmath62 where we have used the definition of @xmath63 .",
    "we now have a leading order expression for @xmath45 as a function only of @xmath64 , which we have defined to be @xmath65 .",
    "plotting @xmath66 as a function of @xmath64 we obtain the graph in figure [ fig : f ] ( comparing to figure [ fig : energy_density ] we find that the two graphs have the same qualitative behaviour , as we would expect ) .",
    "we see that @xmath66 , and therefore @xmath45 is positive for @xmath67 . in order to find @xmath68 we seek to solve @xmath69 . by manipulating this equation , squaring twice to remove the square roots , we find ( thanks to some miraculous cancellations of terms ) that solutions for @xmath68 must obey @xmath70 substituting the solution to this equation",
    ", @xmath71 back into we find that this is indeed a solution to @xmath69 .    to summarise",
    ", we have shown that the wec for the shell branch nonextremal enhanon solution is not violated for @xmath72 when @xmath73 .",
    "the adm mass of the nonextremal enhanon solution described in section [ sec : review ] is given by ( see refs . @xcite and @xcite ) @xmath74 at @xmath75 the adm mass of the horizon branch is @xmath76 whereas for the extremal enhanon solution ( i.e. the shell branch solution at @xmath75 ) we have @xmath77 so there is a mass gap between the mass of the extremal solution and the lowest possible mass of the horizon branch solution .",
    "this mass gap has presented a puzzle in the literature ( see refs . @xcite and @xcite ) because the shell branch was thought to be unphysical , and it was unknown what form a solution whose mass lies within the mass gap should take .",
    "we have shown in the previous section that the shell branch is in fact physical for some small values of @xmath0 .",
    "the question then arises whether or not the mass gap is filled by these physical shell branch solutions . to answer this question ,",
    "we again expand everything as series in @xmath51 , and we take @xmath78 then for the adm mass of the nonextremal enhanon solution we find @xmath79 where @xmath63 is given by equation . again taking @xmath80 we find @xmath81 in the previous section we found that the largest values of @xmath64 at which the shell branch remained physical was @xmath82 . at this value of @xmath64",
    "the shell branch mass is @xmath83 we conclude that the mass gap is indeed covered providing the expansion in @xmath51 is valid .",
    "we can also check numerically that the mass gap is covered when we use the exact expressions for @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the mass gap between the shell branch solution at @xmath0 and the lowest possible mass of the horizon branch solution is @xmath86 the graph in figure [ fig : energy_gap ] shows a plot of @xmath87 against @xmath0 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "comparing this graph with that of figure [ fig : energy_density ] we can see that the mass gap is covered ( i.e. @xmath90 ) for @xmath0 well within the range for which the shell branch solution physical .",
    "we have checked this result numerically for various values of @xmath21 and @xmath51 ( including some for which the expansion in @xmath51 is not valid , e.g. @xmath91 ) , and we have found that the mass gap is covered by the physical shell branch solution in all cases .",
    "we have shown that the nonextremal shell branch enhanon solution is physical when the nonextremality parameter @xmath0 is small enough .",
    "we have also shown that a supergravity solution of the form given in - exists for all masses above the adm mass of the extremal enhanon .",
    "the nonextremal enhanon whose mass is close to that of the extremal enhanon should take the form of the shell branch solution , because no horizon branch solution exists .",
    "this was to be expected because the shell branch solution tends to the extremal solution in the extremality limit @xmath29 .",
    "however , the solution for a nonextremal enhanon with a large adm mass takes the form of the horizon branch solution , because the shell branch solution is unphysical in this region of the parameter space .",
    "this was also to be expected because the object with large mass should behave like a black hole , and should therefore have a horizon , as was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    having identified the form of the nonextremal enhanon solution it would be interesting to return to the questions of stability that were addressed in refs . @xcite and @xcite . since",
    "the shell branch solution is valid for smaller masses , and the horizon branch for larger masses , we expect a transition from the horizon branch to the shell branch at some value of @xmath0 .",
    "the stability of the horizon branch solution was tested in refs . @xcite and @xcite , but no instabilities were found .",
    "however the results we have described here may shed some light on this problem .",
    "we now have a clearer idea of the value of @xmath0 at which we expect the transition to occur since the shell branch is unphysical for @xmath92 , where @xmath93 ."
