    "it has long been known that near - field electrodynamics allows energy transfer without emission of real photons .",
    "a striking example of this principle is provided by recent advances in wireless non radiative energy transfer @xcite ; another recent example is auger - mediated ` sticking ' @xcite , whereby scattering states of positrons may transition to bound states in a metal , by transferring energy to a valence electron which can then leave the surface of the metal . nowadays",
    "the phenomenon of non - radiative decay is of great scientific interest in many different fields of physics and chemistry @xcite . in particular ,",
    "new paradigms for solar energy conversion make use of nonradiative coupling for direct transfer of energy from the excitons created in the solar absorber to high mobility charge carriers @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the mechanism for this transfer relies on the near - field resonance of electric dipoles , and is generally known as frster resonance energy transfer ( fret ) @xcite . in its simplest formulation ,",
    "fret @xcite is the quantum version of a classical resonance phenomenon , whereby oscillating electric dipoles exchange energy through their mutual electric fields @xcite .",
    "some studies in the quantum version have considered the possibility of coherent interactions between the dipoles @xcite .",
    "such quantum coherence has been observed in the fmo complex , @xcite and it has been suggested that this may partly explain the high efficiency of energy transfer between chromophores .",
    "interestingly , it has recently been demonstrated that the classical dipole model reproduces the quantum coherence as well @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we revisit the analysis of the rate and efficiency of fret , in the context of a donor and an acceptor species with comparable electronic energy gaps .",
    "in this situation fret is evidenced by decreased natural fluorescence from the donor , and enhanced fluorescence from the acceptor .",
    "the distance over which fret has been observed ranges from @xmath0 to @xmath1 nm , with the strength varying as the inverse sixth power of the separation .    the fundamental mechanism underlying fret is resonance between excited electronic states in the donor and the acceptor molecules .",
    "the excited electronic states have non - zero electric dipole moments , and the resulting dipoles experience a coulomb interaction .",
    "the energy exchange is complicated by the coupling of electronic states to vibronic molecular states , leading to a broadening of the linewidths and a weakening of the resonant interaction .",
    "this vibronic coupling explains the difference between early inaccurate calculations of fret efficiency ( by perrin @xcite and others ) which were based solely on dipole resonance , and the later more successful calculations by frster @xcite which included vibronic effects .",
    "in this paper we consider a simple model for fret which incorporates both electronic and vibronic effects .",
    "the model applies in situations where the donor molecule is rigid , with weak coupling between its electronic and its vibronic states , while the acceptor has strong electronic - vibronic coupling in its excited state . in this situation",
    "the model is exactly solvable and thus allows a comparison with the perturbative formulas derived by frster and others .",
    "in particular we derive exact formulas for fret efficiency and the frster radius , and we compare these to the well - known frster formulas .",
    "furthermore , the model is fully quantum mechanical and predicts coherent oscillations between donor and acceptor under strong fret conditions .",
    "the model contains a parameter which determines the strength of the electronic - vibronic coupling in the acceptor , and for weak coupling the model reproduces the long - range interactions ( up to @xmath2 nm ) calculated by perrin .",
    "@xcite    as described above , the model applies to a fret system where a rigid donor species , with weak coupling between electronic and vibronic states , interacts with an acceptor species where electronic and vibronic states are strongly coupled . thus the donor is modeled by a simple two - state system , corresponding to its electronic ground and excited states .",
    "the donor s vibronic degrees of freedom are _ frozen _ and do not appear in the model . as we discuss in more detail below , this kind of model can be realized in practice with quantum dots ( qds ) . for the acceptor",
    "we again include only two electronic states , corresponding to the ground and excited states , but in addition , we include vibronic effects in the excited state . the excited band is described in detail below . for the moment , we note that the electronic - vibronic coupling is derived from the born - oppenheimer approximation and assumes that the vibronic degrees of freedom are entrained to the electronic state .",
    "initially we assume that the vibronic degrees of freedom are also frozen in the acceptor ground state .",
    "later we indicate how nonzero temperature effects may be included by unfreezing these degrees of freedom .",
    "the key step in the solution of our model is the reduction to a finite dimensional system which exhibits the same efficiency for resonant energy transfer .",
    "the efficiency can be computed exactly for this finite - dimensional model , and this provides our exact results for the full model . in order to compare with frster s formulas",
    ", we also compute the absorption coefficient for our model , and we use this to evaluate the overlap integral which appears in the standard rate formulas .    as an application we apply our model to the analysis of one particular system of this type which exhibits fret , namely the pairing of a qd donor species with bacteriorhodopsin ( br ) as the acceptor .",
    "the qd is known to have sharp emission lines for fluorescence and , thus , is a good candidate for the _ rigid _ donor molecule described above .",
    "we find good agreement with other calculations of the fret rate for this system .",
    "we employ the born - oppenheimer approximation and assume that the electronic state of the molecule determines its overall character , so that the vibronic state is entrained to the electronic state .",
    "thus the state space is a direct sum @xmath3 with one factor for each electronic state .",
    "the electronic configuration determines an effective hamiltonian for the vibronic degrees of freedom , and each space @xmath4 is spanned by these vibronic states attached to the corresponding ground state .",
    "the spaces @xmath4 may be discrete or continuous , depending on the structure of the vibronic states . for simplicity",
    "we include only two electronic states , the ground state and the excited state , thus the state space is @xmath5 .",
    "we assume a non - degenerate electronic ground state @xmath7 , and we also assume that the vibronic modes are frozen , so @xmath6 is one - dimensional . for the acceptor",
    "this assumes zero temperature .",
    "later we extend to nonzero temperatures by including vibronic ground states .",
    "again , we assume a non - degenerate electronic excited state @xmath9 . for the donor ,",
    "the vibronic modes are frozen , so that @xmath8 is one - dimensional .",
    "however , for the acceptor , the electronic state determines an effective hamiltonian for the vibronic states , which are labeled by their energy eigenvalues @xmath10 . for this subspace",
    "we assume that the vibronic states form a continuous band with a uniform density of states , with eigenvalues extending from @xmath11 to @xmath12 . under this assumption",
    "we ignore any edge effects in the band .",
    "thus the space @xmath8 is isomorphic to the one - particle hilbert space @xmath13 , and we represent a state as a square integrable function @xmath14 where _",
    "|_exc()|^2 d = 1  .",
    "the time evolution is @xmath15 . for convenience",
    "we denote the hamiltonian in this basis as @xmath16 , so that ( h _ exc ) ( ) = _ exc ( )",
    ".      as long as the electronic state does not change , the dynamics of the vibronic state is completely determined by the fixed effective hamiltonian corresponding to this electronic configuration ( here we are neglecting any feedback reaction from the vibronic modes on the electronic modes ) . however ,",
    "when the molecule undergoes an electronic transition , for example by photon absorption , the effective hamiltonian for the vibronic states immediately changes .",
    "this sudden change creates an excited vibronic state , as the previously stationary vibronic state becomes a superposition of energy eigenstates states of the new hamiltonian .",
    "we call this vibronic state an _ exciton_. the exciton behaves like a delocalized one - particle state . in our model , exciton states will arise only in the excited band of the acceptor , due to a transition from the ground state .",
    "we assume an average energy @xmath17 for these exciton states .",
    "turning now to transitions , we consider only radiative interactions which act solely on the electronic state .",
    "thus transitions of the vibronic state occur as a consequence of the change of the effective hamiltonian due to the electronic transition .",
    "the electronic matrix element due to the interaction @xmath18 is [ matr - el-1 ] _ exc | v | _",
    "we find an explicit form for this matrix element for the situations of interest , namely , direct photon absorption and resonant excitation through the coulomb interaction . in order to determine the vibronic matrix element",
    ", we follow jortner @xcite and proceed by analogy with the derivation of the lineshape of a resonance . recall that a resonance is a perturbation of an embedded eigenvalue in continuous spectrum .",
    "the perturbation causes the eigenvalue to _ dissolve _ , accompanied by the emission of a one - particle state in the continuous spectrum . in our model this one - particle state is the exciton .",
    "thus the transition from a vibronic ground state is accompanied by the creation of an exciton , which is a normalized excited vibronic state .",
    "the breit - wigner form for the lineshape of the resonance is a lorentzian , where the width corresponds to the lifetime of the resonance , @xcite and the center is the average energy .",
    "we assume the same form for the exciton , so the wave function of the exciton ( in the diagonal energy representation ) is the square root of a lorentzian : [ lorentz1 ] f ( ) =  . using a lorentzian form",
    "implicitly assumes that the energy band extends from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "we make this assumption , thus ignoring any edge effects in the band .",
    "the width @xmath19 depends on the particular system and determines the lifetime of the exciton .",
    "the lorentzian is centered at energy @xmath17 , corresponding to the average exciton energy .",
    "we also include a phase factor @xmath20 , which may depend on @xmath10 . as we will see this phase factor is irrelevant to the calculation of the fret efficiency .",
    "the fret interaction between the donor and the acceptor causes an exchange of energy as the excited state is transferred from one to the other .",
    "although the transfer becomes irreversible after some time , the initial interaction is unitary and thus admits the possibility of oscillations between donor and acceptor .",
    "we use standard notation , with @xmath21 for donor ground state , @xmath22 for donor excited state , @xmath23 for acceptor ground state , and @xmath24 for acceptor excited state .",
    "thus the coupled donor - acceptor system is described by the collection of states | d a , | d^ * a , | d a^ * , | d^ * a^ * , where both @xmath25 and @xmath26 are single states , while @xmath27 and @xmath28 contain the exciton subspace .",
    "the fret interaction is dipole - dipole in lowest order , and so its strength decays as the inverse third power of the distance .",
    "the hamiltonian is determined by the matrix element of the coulomb interaction @xmath29 between the electronic parts of the states @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "thus the electronic transition matrix element is [ def : u ] u & = & d a^ * | v_c | d^ * a + & = & ( * d*_d _ a - ( * d*_d ) ( * d*_a ) )  , where @xmath32 is the separation between the systems , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the transition dipole moments of the donor and acceptor , respectively .",
    "we use atomic units throughout , and we assume that the dielectric constant is @xmath0 . we look in detail at specific models later , but for the moment we note that for typical systems the dipole moment is about @xmath1 d , so at separations of around @xmath35 nm the interaction energy @xmath36 ev , compared to the typical energy gaps between ground and excited states of @xmath37 ev .    in the absence of other effects , we could analyze the dynamics of this coupled system by restricting to the subspace spanned by the states @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and computing the time evolution of the initial state @xmath30 under the influence of the interaction @xmath38 .",
    "the hamiltonian is h = e_1 & f",
    "| u | f & e_2 + h  , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the electronic energy gaps of the donor and acceptor , respectively ; @xmath38 is the interaction matrix element defined in eq .",

    "( [ lorentz1 ] ) , and @xmath42 denotes the corresponding annihilation operator .      in our model",
    "we also include the effects of fluorescent decay from the excited state to the ground state for both systems .",
    "we do this by introducing jump operators for the ( irreversible ) fluorescent decays from excited to ground state and use a master equation to compute the time evolution of the density matrix .",
    "so we are using the markov approximation for the coupling to the electromagnetic field which causes fluorescence.@xcite in order to separate the outcomes from the two excited states @xmath30 and @xmath31 , we use two copies of the ground state to indicate which molecule has decayed ( since the jump operators are irreversible , there is no coupling from these ground states back to the excited states ) . thus the system is represented by a density matrix @xmath43 , spanning the states @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are copies of the ground state , and the two fluorescent decay channels are @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in this subspace",

    "these states are assumed non degenerate , and thus completely labeled by their energy eigenvalue @xmath67 , with respect to the hamiltonian determined by the electronic state @xmath7 .",
