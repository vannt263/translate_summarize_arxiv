    "the common - envelope ( ce ) phase is one of the most important and least understood phases of stellar evolution .",
    "originally proposed by @xcite to explain the origin of short - period binaries with compact objects , it can also significantly alter the evolution of systems in which the envelope remains bound , leaving an atypical single star ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for example , it is now widely believed that the unusual properties of the progenitor of sn1987a are due to a binary merger some 20,000yr before the explosion @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in the case where the primary initiates mass transfer either when crossing the hertzsprung gap ( so - called early case b mass transfer ) or later as a red supergiant ( late case b / c mass transfer ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the primary has already developed a deep convective envelope and mass transfer is dynamically unstable if the mass ratio exceeds a critical value , leading to a common - envelope and spiral - in phase .",
    "early case b mass transfer initially occurs on the thermal timescale of the mass donor and is dynamically stable ; but the secondary may not be able to accrete all of the transferred mass , and this may also lead to a common - envelope system and possibly the merging of the system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while the common envelope maintains co - rotation with the embedded binary , orbital angular momentum is efficiently transferred from the binary orbit to the envelope , where most of the initial orbital angular momentum is stored @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the orbital separation in units of 2500@xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the masses of the primary and the secondary in units of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( as indicated by the subscripts ) , respectively , and @xmath9 is the total mass in units of @xmath10 .",
    "this phase may last perhaps for a few decades and ends when the envelope becomes differentially rotating .",
    "the subsequent rapid plunge - in of the secondary then drives significant envelope expansion and the ejection of at least some of the envelope @xcite .",
    "if the envelope is not completely ejected in this phase ( the case of interest in this study ) , the spiral - in continues and now becomes self - regulated where all the energy dissipated by the further orbital decay is transported to the surface and radiated away @xcite .",
    "a second phase of mass loss may result from a nuclear flash that may occur during the final core merger @xcite .",
    "previous one - dimensional numerical simulations by @xcite have shown that significant mass loss may occur even when most of the envelope remains bound . in the three dimensional models of @xcite and @xcite , most mass loss occurs in the orbital plane of the binary . however , these authors considered the case where most / all of the envelope was ejected . in this study , we consider the less energetic case appropriate for a merger .",
    "as we will show , in this case mass loss may preferentially occur at mid - latitudes and be suppressed in the equatorial direction if the energy deposited is less than about one - third of the binding energy of the envelope . in section  2",
    "we outline our numerical method and in section  3 we present the main results of our study and their dependence on the input parameters . in section",
    "4 we apply these results to observed systems , in particular sn1987a and sheridan 25 .",
    "we model the common envelope as a condensed polytrope with adiabatic index @xmath11 with a central point mass which contains two - fifths of the system mass . assuming spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium initially , we obtain the radial density profile by integrating the dimensionless equations , @xmath12 @xmath13 with the inner boundary conditions @xmath14 and @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    ". the free parameters @xmath19 are determined from the surface boundary conditions @xmath20 where @xmath21 . for all hydrodynamical simulations presented in this paper , we use the gadget code of @xcite , which implements gravity and gas dynamics using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) method @xcite .",
    "the envelope density is sampled with @xmath22 particles using a monte - carlo method followed by isentropic relaxation to reduce numerical noise @xcite .",
    "the code units are @xmath23 , the mass of the envelope and @xmath24 , the initial ( non - rotating ) stellar radius ( the total stellar mass including the core is @xmath25 ) .",
    "this implies that time is measured in the code in units of @xmath26 and velocity in units of @xmath27 .",
    "note that this allows simple re - scaling of the results presented in this paper .    to parametrize the spin - up of the envelope and the energy deposited by the spiral - in , we define two parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the ratio of the energy deposited to the binding energy of the envelope and @xmath31 is a dimensionless measure of of the envelope angular momentum following the early in - spiral of the secondary",
    ".    to spin up the envelope we add angular momentum on a dynamical timescale using the following recipe : during every fixed timestep @xmath32 , the rotational velocity of each particle is incremented by an amount @xmath33 i.e. as long as the velocity remains sub - keplerian .",
    "the angular velocity increment is @xmath34 of the critical velocity at the surface of the non - rotating envelope ( @xmath35 in code units ) . if at any time the particle velocity @xmath36 reaches the local keplerian velocity , we set @xmath37 thereafter",
    "this leads to solid body rotation in the inner envelope and a slightly rising specific angular momentum profile in the outer envelope ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ang - part ] ) .",
    "the spin - up phase is terminated when @xmath29 reaches 0.235 , 0.588 , 0.817 , respectively , for the three cases we consider in this paper ( note that no particles become super - critical ; see figure [ fig : env - part ] and table [ table : env ] ) .",
    "these three values correspond to envelope angular momenta of @xmath38 and @xmath39 which is comparable to the available orbital angular momentum ( equation [ eq : angmom ] ) .    to simulate the deposition of the energy and the rapid heating of the envelope during the plunge - in phase , we then add entropy to the inner envelope [ @xmath40 , from calculations discussed in @xcite and @xcite ] .",
    "initially , we consider the case where the energy is deposited immediately after the envelope has been spun up .",
    "the response of the envelope is then followed for 1015 dynamical timescales after the instantaneous energy deposition , at which point all the ejected particles are to good approximation on ballistic trajectories .",
    "since we do not follow the evolution of the spiraling - in binary components , we do not encounter resolution problems when the orbital separation becomes comparable to the sph smoothing length @xcite ; our model is mainly limited by physical approximations ( such as the equation of state ; the lack of energy transport ) rather than the numerical resolution ( see appendix a )  except near the surface . the steep density profile at the surface is poorly resolved by sph particles , and a well known problem of sph models in this context ( as , e.g. , seen in supernova models ) is an over - estimate of the mass contained in low - velocity material .",
    ".properties of the three rotating envelopes immediately before the energy deposition for the zero - delay case .",
    "all values in cgs units are for @xmath41 , @xmath42 appropriate to the merger model for sn  1987a . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note : data taken from @xmath43@xcite , @xmath44@xcite , @xmath45@xcite and @xmath46@xcite",
    ".    many non - spherical nebulae are axially symmetric , which has been interpreted as evidence for rapid rotation , possibly as a result of binary interactions .",
    "a notable example is the mysterious nebula surrounding the supernova sn1987a , which consists of three roughly parallel rings , one centered on the supernova and the other two displaced by @xmath47 arc - second to either side @xcite .",
    "the supernova itself was anomalous in several other respects ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , which are most consistent with a binary merger some 20,000 years before the supernova event @xcite .",
    "in particular , the blue supergiant progenitor and the chemical anomalies in the inner ring can easily be explained as the result of the dredge - up of core material in the final stage of the merger @xcite .",
    "the fast wind ( @xmath48 ) of such a blue supergiant will sweep up and enhance any structures already present in the ejecta , leading to an axially symmetric but highly aspherical nebula .      during",
    "late he shell burning the primary will be a red supergiant with a critical surface rotation velocity of @xmath49 which is comparable to the velocities observed in the sn1987a nebula ( see table [ table : nebulae ] ) .",
    "the latitude - dependence of the ejected material of model 1 , shown in figure [ fig : massenh ] , is characterised by a strong enhancement at mid - latitudes , while no material is lost in the equatorial region .",
    "the following features of the nebula may therefore be understood :    1 .   _ strong mass enhancement in the outer rings_. the outer rings ( ors ) are a real density enhancement ( @xmath50 the ambient value ) and are not simply due to limb brightening of an hourglass structure @xcite . in our model",
    "the ors result from wind - driven pressure gradients in the seed structures which directly result form the anisotropic ejection of material during the merger phase .",
    "previous models based only on equatorial density enhancements in the pre - existing material have been unable to explain the high density in the ors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "displacement of the outer rings relative to the inner ring_. we favour a model in which the inner ring originates a few 1000 years _",
    "after _ the merger event , in a rotation - enforced outflow during contraction on the post - merger blue loop ( heger & langer 1998 ; also see collins et al .",
    "the relative displacement of the outer rings can be understood if the mass ejection during the merger event itself was slightly asymmetric , perhaps due to a non - axisymmetric pulsational instability in the envelope , which gives the ejecta a velocity of @xmath51kms@xmath52 relative to the merger remnant .",
    "hence the wind - driven pressure gradients are no longer axisymmetric and the planes in which the outer rings lie will be slightly inclined with respect to the plane of the inner ring .",
    "this would explain both the offset of the outer rings and their shape , which is noticeably non - elliptical in projection .",
    "3 .   _ north / south asymmetry_. since",
    "the planes of the outer rings are no longer parallel to one another , the southern outer ring is observed closer to face - on in projection than the northern one .",
    "mass loss during common - envelope evolution may explain the broadly similar structures seen around other luminous stars , listed in table [ table : nebulae ] .",
    "of these , the nebula around the b1.5 supergiant sheridan 25 shows the most compelling similarities , since it has an equatorial ring of at least @xmath53 @xcite and polar lobes , each containing @xmath54 .",
    "it is in a post main sequence , though probably pre - red supergiant , evolutionary state ( with n / c @xmath55 , n / o @xmath56 , * ? ? ?",
    "the dynamical age of the nebula has been estimated to be around 6,000 years .",
    "the observed velocities suggest an envelope radius of @xmath57 at the time of ejection , corresponding to a merger during the hertzsprung gap crossing .",
    "although the density structure of the common envelope will differ from that of a @xmath11 condensed polytrope , the results may still be applicable if the envelope is aspherical .",
    "we suggest a model with equatorial mass loss during the merger , such as model 2 discussed above ( see right - hand panel of figure [ fig : massenh ] ) , since the envelope can not store enough angular momentum to generate a significant post - merger equatorial outflow .",
    "hence an asymmetry during the merger will displace both the equatorial and polar material from the site of the merged star .",
    "the equatorial ring is offset from sher 25 by @xmath58 pc @xcite , which is consistent with this model .",
    "the three principal anomalous features of the supernova sn1987a , viz .",
    "its blue supergiant progenitor , its over - abundance of certain elements , notably he , and the presence of highly structured circumstellar material , are all consistent with a binary merger some 20,000 years before the explosion . in this paper , we have demonstrated how density enhancements at mid - latitudes arise during mass ejection from a rotationally distorted star .",
    "subsequent interaction with the fast wind of the blue supergiant prior to the supernova ( cf .",
    "* ) then leads to the formation of the outer rings with a density enhancement of a factor of 150 , in calculations of @xcite which will be further discussed in a future paper .",
    "similarly , the nebula around sher 25 may be explained by a binary merger following a ce phase during the crossing of the hertzsprung gap by the primary .",
    "one notable difference in this case is that the equatorial ring likely originates during the merger , which is consistent with observations showing that the centre of the equatorial ring is displaced by some 0.05 pc from sher 25 .",
    "future observations of the rotation rate of sher 25 would help to confirm this model .",
    "although the nebula around the more massive system ry scuti ( o9.5 + o6.5 ) appears similar , its evolution is probably somewhat different .",
    "data from the keck telescope and the hst , discussed in @xcite and @xcite , show a massive equatorial dust torus and two narrow rings symmetrical about the equatorial plane , with a dynamical age of 120 years .",
    "the massive torus probably originated during thermal timescale mass outflow from the outer lagrangian l2 point which is still occurring today , albeit at the much lower rate of @xmath59 .",
    "subsequent deflection of the fast wind in a manner somewhat analogous to the horseshoe model of @xcite may explain the origin of the two narrow rings .",
    "@xcite have suggested that the b[e ] component of the spectroscopic binary r4 in the lmc could be the result of a case b / c merger , i.e.  the system would originally have been a triple system , where the companion a star now serves as an astronomical clock and indicates that the present primary has lost @xmath60% of its zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) mass @xcite . since the companion is already a post - main sequence a supergiant , the pre - merger components can not be much more massive , e.g. @xmath61 for the original primary .",
    "in addition , @xcite find evidence of cno - processed circumstellar material with a dynamical age of @xmath62 years which is consistent with ejection during a binary merger .",
    "direct images of the nebula would be of great benefit to understanding this system .",
    "bipolarity is also common in observations of planetary nebulae .",
    "asymmetric mass loss during a common - envelope phase ( with or without a merger ) provides physical motivation for the equatorial density enhancement functions proposed by @xcite and @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we speculate that the homunculus nebula around @xmath63 carinae may also have originated during a common - envelope phase since its kinetic energy is @xmath64ergs @xcite , comparable to the luminous energy of the @xmath65 outburst . both the mass loss rate in the stellar wind ( @xmath66 ) and its latitude dependence suggest rapid rotation of the central star @xcite",
    ". in the merger scenario @xmath63 carinae was originally a triple system in which the closer components ( @xmath67d ) merged 150yr ago to leave the present companion in an eccentric 5.5-yr orbit .",
    "the computations reported here were performed using the uk astrophysical fluids facility ( ukaff ) .",
    "the authors would also like to thank n. langer for stimulating discussions .",
