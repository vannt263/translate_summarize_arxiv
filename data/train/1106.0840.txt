    "wireless personal communication enables ubiquitous exchange of various data types such as voice , video , photos , and text among individuals .",
    "the emergence of new advanced systems such as the ieee 802.11ac @xcite and the 3gpp lte - advanced @xcite are expected to achieve additional data rates .",
    "of late , wireless communication industries have begun to discuss their scenarios serving machine - type communication devices such as meters / sensors as well as user equipments such as smart phones @xcite@xcite .",
    "these machine - to - machine ( m2 m ) communications have extensive applications , from monitoring environments to full electrical / mechanical automation ( e.g. smart grid , smart city , internet of things ) , which has been being considered as one of the most crucial technologies in future @xcite@xcite .",
    "the sensor network can also be regarded as a kind of m2 m , and there have been many studies in the form of ad - hoc networks @xcite@xcite .",
    "this paper only considers the environment with specific data collectors directly communicating with sensors .",
    "this environment is suitable when sensor nodes support only simple single - hop communication functionalities and deployment of many data collectors is easy .",
    "this type of m2 m communication is similar to cellular communication systems where the base stations serve user equipment within their coverage , but it has the unique characteristics @xcite@xcite : there can be a huge number of devices ( e.g. trillions ) each of which has only a small amount of data and a low activity , and their functionalities have to be simple .",
    "these characteristics may require technologies differentiated from the conventional high data rate human - to - human ( h2h ) communications .",
    "for example , machine - type devices such as meters and sensors need uplink resources intermittently for reporting measured or sensed data to their serving data collector , but it is hard to dedicate limited uplink resources to each .",
    "thus , simple random access can be considered as a solution for directly transmitting measured data or initially requesting uplink resources .",
    "the data collectors that receive many sensors measured data simultaneously can successfully decode only signals with signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) above a certain value . in order to keep a high success probability of many sensor nodes intermittent transmissions ,",
    "the system may need a lot of data collectors , and conventional macro / micro base stations may not be appropriate for these roles . in other words ,",
    "data collectors have to be easy to deploy and cost - effective .",
    "they support only simple functionalities and are interconnected with external networks through wired or wireless links .",
    "it can be considered that not only a new type of device for data collection is defined but also such devices as pico / femto base stations around sensor nodes play the role of data collectors .",
    "[ fig_system_model ] shows a system architecture with data collectors and sensor nodes . in this environment ,",
    "some questions are : how many data collectors are needed ?",
    "how much transmit power sensors have to use for successful transmission ? and , how the wireless channels affect the performance",
    ". this paper will provide answers to those questions through a stochastic analysis based on a spatial point process and on simulations .",
    "the main factor of determining system performance is the interference from neighbor sensor nodes .",
    "this interference depends on the spatial distribution and sensor - node access methods . because the spatial configurations of transmitting and receiving nodes can have enormous possibilities , it is impossible to consider each possibility .",
    "stochastic geometry provides a useful mathematical tool to model network topology , and it also enables analysis of essential quantities such as interference distribution and outage @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "this stochastic geometry has mainly been applied to pure ad hoc networks and their performance has been analyzed under the assumption of random transmitter location and receiver with fixed distances to its transmitter @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "this paper considers the environment where both transmitters ( sensor nodes ) and receivers ( data collectors ) are randomly deployed and each transmitter are served by the data collector nearest to it . @xcite-@xcite",
    "have analyzed the distribution of signal - to - interference ratio ( sir ) or sinr in random cellular networks where both transmitter and receiver are randomly located ; @xcite analyzed the distribution of sir considering the path loss and shadowing , @xcite derived a simple - form sinr distribution in case of rayleigh fading and a path - loss exponent of four , and @xcite expanded the analysis results in @xcite into the results for a more general fading model including nakagami-@xmath0 fading .",
    "but , they assumed that each base station always has the user equipment within its coverage and communicates with a user equipment that is scheduled exclusively within one cell and focused on transmitter - centric coverage ( i.e. downlink ) .",
    "@xcite modeled cdma uplink interference power as a log - normal distribution using the moment - matching method . also , @xcite asymptotically analyzed uplink spectral efficiency in spatially distributed wireless networks , where the base stations have multiple antennas , by using infinite - random - matrix theory and stochastic geometry .",
    "the current system is similar to the uplink cellular systems , but this paper will only consider random access without any explicit scheduling for the simple functionalities of sensor nodes and data collectors .",
    "the three contributions of this paper are : first , an analysis shows how the channel affects the sir distribution for nakagami-@xmath0 fading .",
    "a simple form on the sinr distribution is found for some special channel models .",
    "second , an analysis describes how many data collectors per area are on average required to meet the outage probability for the given mean number of sensor nodes per area in case of rayleigh fading .",
    "third , this paper suggests a simple design method of the transmit power and the mean number of data collectors to meet the given outage probability .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec_model ] presents the system model based on a homogeneous poisson point process ( ppp ) .",
    "section  [ sec_sinr ] analyzes the sir distribution for nakagammi-@xmath0 fading channels and the sinr distribution for rayleigh fading channels .",
    "section  [ sec_density ] derives the intensity of data collectors required to keep the outage probability below a certain value and suggests a design method of the transmit power .",
    "section  [ sec_results ] discusses numerical results . finally , section  [ sec_conclusions ] concludes .",
    "a sensor node senses or measures environments and then transmits its data to the closest data collector .",
    "sensor nodes do not always have data to transmit but send them only when their sensing data are generated .",
    "for example , machines such as meters and event sensors may transmit data intermittently rather than continuously , and it has to be successful with probability above a certain value . in order to model intermittent transmissions , the sensor node s activity is defined as @xmath1 .",
    "this value of @xmath1 is between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and this paper considers its small values .",
    "meanwhile , data collectors that receive data from sensor nodes , are always ready to receive data from them .",

    "each sensor node transmits its data to a data collector closest to it , so a data collector builds a coverage based on voronoi tessellation , as shown in fig  [ fig_voronitessellation ] .    the standard power loss propagation model with the path loss exponent @xmath8 and the nakagami-@xmath0 fading model are considered . in the nakagami-@xmath0 fading model @xcite , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 model rayleigh fading , rician",

    "is required to deal with a huge number of wireless nodes , so the rigorous understanding about the spatial distribution and effect of interference will be basics for them . even though this paper has considered only simple random access , these results will be able to be used as basic models for developing more sophisticated spatial resource management methods .",
    "this paper has considered the environment where receivers ( data collectors ) as well as transmitters ( sensor nodes ) are randomly deployed and each transmitter is served by the receiver nearest to it . in network",
    "topology modeled by homogeneous poisson point processes , analysis and simulation results showed the sinr distribution , and a simple design method of transmit power was suggested . under interference - limited environments , the larger the path loss exponent and the portion of line - of - site factors were , the less the outage probability was . on the contrary , under non - neglectable noise environments ,",
    "the large path loss exponent caused severe performance degradation .",
    "moreover , the intensity of data collectors required to keep the outage probability above a certain value was derived , and it depends on required outage probability , an intensity of sensor nodes , a fading channel model , a path loss exponent and noise power .",
    "this required intensity helps to design such parameters as the amount of wireless resources and the access probability for medium access control .",
    "random access scheme is very simple and does not cause control - overhead problems even under environments with a huge number of sensor nodes , but its required intensity of data collectors is never small .",
    "thus , it is needed to find more sophisticated spatial resource management schemes and the result of this paper may be used as a basic model for them .",
    "this proof is similar to proof of theorem 1 in @xcite that has considered the transmitter - centric coverage ( or downlink ) and only the transmitter intensity . here",
    ", an analysis focuses on the receiver - centric coverage by data collectors ( or uplink ) and allows that multiple transmitters within the service area of a common data collector simultaneously transmit . for those differences and the completeness",
    ", this paper provides the full derivation of the ccdf of sinr .",
    "the probability that there is a data collector at a distance of @xmath15 from a typical sensor node is @xmath129 . for this data collector to be a serving data collector of a typical sensor node",
