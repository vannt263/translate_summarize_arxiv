    "this work is part of a large project , in which our group ( active galactic nuclei integral field spectroscopy - agnifs ) has been observing the inner kiloparsec of nearby active galaxies using optical and near - infrared ( hereafter near - ir ) high - spatial resolution ( a few to tens of pc ) integral field spectroscopy .",
    "we have obtained the gaseous flux distributions , kinematics and excitation , with the main goal of mapping gas inflows and outflows and constraining the corresponding mass flow rates and power .",
    "whenever the signal - to - noise ratio in the continuum and absorption lines is high enough we also map the stellar kinematics and ages . in the near - ir ,",
    "our main results so far can be summarized as follows .",
    "we have found that the molecular ( 2 ) and ionized gases present distinct flux distributions and kinematics , with the former restricted to the plane of the galaxy and presenting , in some cases , streaming motions towards the nucleus , while the latter presents emission from outflowing material at high latitudes above the plane and usually is associated to the radio emission @xcite .",
    "we have concluded that the molecular gas is a good tracer of the nuclear feeding and the ionized gas of its feedback .",
    "nevertheless , the sample observed so far comprises only half a dozen objects and more integral field observations in the near - ir are required in order to have a more complete census of these processes in agns and to relate the mass flow rates to the agn power .    in this work ,",
    "we present the gaseous flux distribution and kinematics of the inner 680 pc of the active galaxy mrk79 obtained from observations using the gemini - north s near - infrared integral field spectrograph ( nifs * ? ? ?",

    "its nucleus is classified as seyfert 1 with a central black hole with a mass of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "it presents extended radio - continuum emission along position angle ( pa ) 11@xmath10 @xcite , which can be described as an asymmetric triple radio structure with the northern source being located at a distance of 800pc from the nucleus and the southern source at 460pc from it @xcite . in the optical , mrk79 presents extended [ oiii ] line emission as observed in ground - based ( e.g. *",

    "the [ oiii]@xmath11 emission extends to about 4.6 arcsec from the nucleus in the north - south direction , being co - spatial with the radio emission and presenting several blobs of enhanced emission @xcite .",
    "an outflowing gas component is suggested by the detection of two components in the [ oiii]@xmath11 mission - line profile with velocities of @xmath12kms@xmath13 and @xmath14kms@xmath13 relative to the systemic velocity of the galaxy .",
    "this component seems to be associated with the northern radio structure @xcite .",

    "the j and kl - band observations of mrk 79 were obtained using the nifs instrument @xcite operating with the gemini north adaptive optics system altair in september 2010 under the programme gn-2010b - q-42 , following the standard object - sky - sky - object dither sequence , with off - source sky positions since the target is extended , and individual exposure times of 520s for the j band and 550s for the k@xmath16 band .",
    "six on - source individual exposures were obtained for each band , totalizing 3120s and 3300s for the j and k@xmath16-band , respectively .",

    "the k@xmath19-band observations were centered at 2.3@xmath17 m , covering the spectral range from 2.10@xmath20 m to 2.53@xmath20 m with a spectral resolution of fwhm@xmath21 . in velocity space ,",
    "the resolution of the observations is @xmath045  for the k@xmath19-band and 35  for the j - band .",
    "the data reduction was accomplished using tasks contained in the nifs package which is part of gemini iraf package , as well as generic iraf tasks .",
    "the reduction procedure included trimming of the images , flat - fielding , sky subtraction , wavelength and s - distortion calibrations .",
    "we have also removed the telluric bands and flux calibrated the frames by interpolating a black body function to the spectrum of the telluric standard star .",

    "the 2   emission lines can be excited by two mechanisms : ( i ) fluorescent excitation through absorption of soft - uv photons ( 9121108  ) in the lyman and werner bands @xcite and ( ii ) collisional excitation due to the heating of the gas by shocks , due to interaction of a radio jet with the interstellar medium @xcite or by x - rays from the agn @xcite .",
    "the second mechanism , usually refereed as thermal processes , is also the responsible for the excitation of the near - ir lines of the .",
    "most of the studies above investigate the origin of both 2  and  using line ratios , such as [ feii]@xmath50m / pa@xmath32 and h@xmath332.1218@xmath17m / br@xmath35 , and a common conclusion among these studies is that thermal processes dominate the 2  emission in the central region of active galaxies , while the fluorescent excitation can contribute only with a small fraction of the observed 2  emission .",
    "the main difficulty in the study of the excitation of the h@xmath3 and  in agns regards the distinction between x - ray and shock mechanisms .",
    "recent detailed studies using integral field spectroscopy  most of them by our agnifs group  indicate that the 2  and  emitting gas have distinct flux distributions and kinematics , with the former being considered a tracer of the feeding of the agn and the latter a tracer of its feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this scenario is also favored in the case of mrk79 .",
    "the h@xmath3 flux distribution in the shape of two spiral arms ( fig.[flux ] ) , observed also in the channel maps ( fig.[slice_h2 ] ) supports a location of the molecular gas in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "additionally , the h@xmath3 velocity field , shown in fig.[vel ] , presents a clear rotation pattern with the southeast side approaching and the northwest side receding from us .",
    "the smaller velocity dispersion values observed for h@xmath3 ( see fig.[sig ] ) , relative to those of the ionized gas , also supports that the h@xmath3 emitting gas is more restricted to the plane of the galaxy .",
    "the  emitting gas presents a more disturbed velocity field , higher @xmath34 values and a flux distribution well correlated with the radio structures , indicating interaction with the radio jet .",
    "the presence of both blueshifts and redshifts to the south of the nucleus at the location of the southern radio structure , suggests that the  emitting gas extends to high galactic latitudes . the hi recombination lines present a similar velocity field to that of , but present smaller @xmath34 values ( intermediate values between those of  and h@xmath3 ) and distinct flux distributions , being more associated to the  emission than to the radio emission , as seen in the figs .",

    "the emission - line ratios can also be used to investigate the gas excitation .",

    "seyfert nuclei have values in the range 0.6@xmath57/@xmath572.0 and 0.6@xmath572/@xmath572.0 , while starburst galaxies have smaller values for both ratios and liners have higher values ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "it can be seen that the /  ratio map presents typical seyfert values for most of the observed field .",
    "the only exception is the nucleus , where /@xmath58 , for which the  flux can be increased due to contamination of the narrow component by the broad profile and thus , decreasing this ratio .",
    "the 2/  line ratio , shown in the right panel of fig .",

    "nevertheless , higher values are observed in the regions where the spiral structures are seen in the h@xmath3 flux distribution ( fig .",
    "[ flux ] ) reaching 2/@xmath59 .",
    "these ratios can be understood by an enhancement of the 2   emission in the spiral arms due to the increase of the gas density due to the spiral structure .    in a recent study , @xcite built photoionization models considering a two - component continuum , one to account for the big bump component peaking at 1 ryd and another to represent the x - ray source that dominates the continuum emission at high energies in order to reproduce the @xmath55m/  and 2@xmath56m/   line ratios of agns .",
    "the authors compared their models with the line ratios observed for a large sample of agn from long - slit and ifu spectroscopy .",
    "they concluded that typical seyfert values for these ratios , as those observed for mrk79 , are well reproduced by the model and concluded that the heating by x - rays produced by active nuclei can be considered a common and very important mechanism of excitation of  and 2  lines . in the case of mrk79 , such conclusion must be taken with caution since the 2  and  have distinct flux distribution and kinematics , suggesting that their emission originate from gas located at distinct regions of the galaxy , as discussed above .",
    "this may also be the case of the extended emission of other seyfert galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "we have observed a good correlation between the  flux distribution and the radio emission , as well as an increase of the  @xmath34 in locations co - spatial with the radio structures .",
    "this correlation is particularly clear in the channel maps shown in fig .",
    "[ slice_fe ] for velocities ranging from @xmath60 to @xmath61  kms@xmath13  enhancements in the flux are observed at the locations of the two main radio structures : a hot spot at the nucleus and another at @xmath012 to the south of the nucleus .",
    "this result suggest that the radio jet has an important role in the  emission , either by releasing iron from dust grains via shocks and increasing its abundance in the gas phase as well as by enhancing the  emitting gas density due to compression produced by the radio jet .",
    "the correlation between the nlr gas emission and radio structures has been questioned in detailed studies of nearby seyfert galaxies .",
    "examples are the studies of the nlr kinematics of ngc4151 @xcite and ngc1068 @xcite , using high - spatial resolution long slit spectra obtained with space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) .",
    "the absence of any clear correlation between the optical emission lines and radio structures led the authors to conclude that there is no connection between the kinematics of the nlr and radio jets .",
    "the argument is that , even though these structures are approximately aligned as they originate in the same agn , when the targets are close enough , high spatial resolution data shows that there is no correlation between the nlr gas kinematics and the radio jet .",
    "although we believe that this may happen in some cases , we would like to point out that in the case of ngc4151 , our study @xcite of the nlr kinematics using adaptive optics near - ir integral field spectroscopy , at similar spatial resolution to that of the above studies , have shown that there is interaction of the radio jet with ambient gas at low velocities .",
    "this finding was only possible because our 3d integral field spectroscopic data has a moderately high spectral resolution ( @xmath25 5000 ) , allowing to inspect and separate the gas emission features at distinct velocities via channel maps .",
    "this separation allowed us to find this interaction of the radio jet with gas at velocities close to systemic . at the high velocity channels , an outflowing component along the ionization cone dominates the gas emission , and",
    "does not show any correlation with the radio jet .    in the case of mrk79 , as pointed out above , even though it is more distant than ngc4151 , the correlation with the radio jet is clearly seen in the channel maps as well as in the velocity dispersion maps .",
