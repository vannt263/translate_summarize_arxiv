    "<S> magnetic skyrmions in chiral magnets are nanoscale , topologically - protected magnetization swirls that are promising candidates for spintronics memory carriers . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , observing and manipulating the skyrmion state on the surface level of the materials are of great importance for future applications . here </S>",
    "<S> , we report a controlled way of creating a multidomain skyrmion state near the surface of a cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 single crystal , observed by soft resonant elastic x - ray scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this technique is an ideal tool to probe the magnetic order at the @xmath2 edge of @xmath3 metal compounds giving a depth sensitivity of @xmath4 nm . the single - domain sixfold - symmetric skyrmion lattice can be broken up into domains overcoming the propagation directions imposed by the cubic anisotropy by applying the magnetic field in directions deviating from the major cubic axes . </S>",
    "<S> our findings open the door to a new way to manipulate and engineer the skyrmion state locally on the surface , or on the level of individual skyrmions , which will enable applications in the future . + * keywords : skyrmion ; multi - domain state ; magnetoelectric ; resonant elastic x - ray scattering *    magnetic skyrmions are topologically stable , vortex - like magnetization patterns , and they form periodic lattices in chiral magnets  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> skyrmions are found in non - centrosymmetric crystals in which the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction arises , such as the cubic chiral magnets mnsi , fege , or fecosi  @xcite , which are metallic or semiconducting . </S>",
    "<S> they are attractive objects for information processing applications  @xcite owing to their topological robustness  @xcite and ease of manipulation by spin or magnon currents  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an important ingredient for memory applications is the formation of magnetic domains and their manipulation , as demonstrated in the racetrack memory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this concept has also been proposed for magnetic skyrmion systems  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . however , the skyrmion state in cubic chiral magnets are usually a single - domain , uniform vortex lattice , which does not support the manipulation of the individual skyrmion . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the break - up of the single - domain skyrmion lattice into a multidomain state , in analogy to the magnetic domains in ferromagnetic media , is pivotal for skyrmion - based memory applications . </S>",
    "<S> so far , only double - split , non - dynamic skyrmion domains have been observed in fecosi  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , little is known about the occurrence of skyrmion domains in other systems , and controlled ways of their manipulation . on the other hand , insulating magnetoelectric materials , such as cu@xmath5oseo@xmath6  @xcite , provide additional degrees of freedom for the manipulation of skyrmions  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 is a local - moment insulator and belongs to the group of cubic chiral magnets with space group @xmath7  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its magnetism is governed by a hierarchy of energy scales that can be described by a ginzburg - landau approach also accounting for thermal fluctuations  @xcite . on the strongest scale , </S>",
    "<S> the combination of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions effectively leads to a ferrimagnetic 3-up-1-down spin configuration of the cu@xmath8 moments on two types of nonequivalent sites in the unit cell  @xcite . on the intermediate scale , </S>",
    "<S> the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction arises as the leading - order spin - orbit coupling term , resulting in a long - wavelength incommensurate helical modulation with the periodicity of @xmath9 nm  @xcite . on the weakest energy scale , higher - order spin - orbit </S>",
    "<S> coupling terms give rise to a cubic anisotropy , favoring helical propagation along the crystalline @xmath10 axes . </S>",
    "<S> after zero - field cooling below the transition temperature of @xmath11k , multiple macroscopic helical domains oriented along the three equivalent @xmath10 directions form . in magnetic fields larger than @xmath12 , </S>",
    "<S> the propagation vector of the helix aligns along the field direction , giving rise to a single - domain conical state . with increasing field , </S>",
    "<S> the spins increasingly tilt towards the field direction until entering a field - polarized regime above the second critical field @xmath13 t . in a phase pocket in small fields just below @xmath14 , a hexagonal skyrmion lattice </S>",
    "<S> is observed in the plane perpendicular to the applied field , forming tubes along the field direction  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> commonly , the skyrmion lattice is a single - domain , long - range ordered state  @xcite . in reciprocal space , the skyrmion lattice may be described by three basis vectors @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 that lie in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field direction and are separated by @xmath18  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute value @xmath19 corresponds to the ` lattice constant ' of the skyrmion lattice , i.e. , the core - to - core distance @xmath20 , with @xmath21 . due to the cubic anisotropy </S>",
    "<S> , one of the three @xmath19 vectors is oriented along a @xmath22100@xmath23 or @xmath22110@xmath23 direction  if the latter is available in the skyrmion lattice plane  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a reorientation from @xmath22110@xmath23 to @xmath22100@xmath23 as a function of increasing temperature and field was reported in cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 , suggesting a delicate balance of the weak cubic anisotropies  @xcite .    in this letter , we performed systematic resonant elastic x - ray scattering ( rexs ) studies in reflection geometry on a cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 single crystal . </S>",
    "<S> we unambiguously identified the helical , conical , and skyrmion lattice states . </S>",
    "<S> for magnetic fields tilted away from the crystalline [ 001 ] axis , the scattering pattern of the skyrmion lattice breaks up into a multitude of sixfold - symmetric sets which are , in general , not aligned along major crystallographic axes . </S>",
    "<S> thoroughly performed photon energy scans reveal identical energy dependencies of all magnetic peaks . in a recent study , langner _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _  found two slightly rotated , sixfold - symmetric scattering patterns that differ in photon energy dependency , which are claimed to be associated with the two different cu sites  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as will be shown , the multidomain skyrmion state clearly has a fundamentally different origin . </S>",
    "<S> it is explained in the framework of competing anisotropies and magnetoelectric effects .     </S>",
    "<S> plane for @xmath24=0 and @xmath24=1 , for which the ( 0,0,1 ) reflection is forbidden.,width=319 ]    rexs is a powerful , surface - sensitive technique that allows for simultaneously resolving long - wavelength modulations along all three directions in reciprocal space . </S>",
    "<S> it combines element - selectivity with extremely fast time resolution . </S>",
    "<S> our experiment was carried out on beamline i10 at the diamond light source , uk , in the ultrahigh vacuum soft x - ray diffractometer rasor  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig_1]a illustrates the geometry of the setup . </S>",
    "<S> the horizontally polarized soft x - rays are tuned to the cu @xmath2 edge at a photon energy of 931.25ev . </S>",
    "<S> the scattered light is captured by either a ccd camera or a photodiode at an angle @xmath25 with respect to the incoming beam . </S>",
    "<S> typically , we used a beam size of @xmath26100@xmath27100  @xmath28m@xmath29 and an exposure time of 2ms for each single image . </S>",
    "<S> a carefully polished cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 high - quality single - crystal measuring @xmath30 , with the edges along @xmath31 $ ] , @xmath32 $ ] , and [ 001 ] , was positioned as sketched . </S>",
    "<S> the sample was confirmed to be of high quality by means of single - crystal x - ray diffraction on a rigaku supernova using a mo @xmath33 source , see figure [ fig_1]b , c . </S>",
    "<S> it is of uniform lattice chirality as determined by electron backscatter diffraction ( ebsd ) . for measurements on rasor , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field direction is typically fixed with respect to the sample plane , i.e. , both the magnets and the sample are moved together by the goniometer angle @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the magnets can also be rotated away from the surface normal direction in the scattering plane by a tilt angle @xmath35 , where @xmath35=@xmath36 corresponds to the field along the @xmath37 $ ] axis of the sample .    </S>",
    "<S> when probing a skyrmion lattice , x - rays acquire the momentum transfer directly from the periodicities of the vortex ordering . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the scattering form factors for the helical and skyrmion orders are significantly different in rexs  unlike for small angle neutron scattering ( sans ) where they are almost the same . for rexs </S>",
    "<S> , the magnetic modulation wave vectors appear as the satellite peaks coupled to the ( 0,0,1 ) structural peak . for our measurements on cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 , we choose the resonant condition at the cu @xmath2 edge and the ( 0,0,1 ) peak is the only accessible reciprocal lattice point for the corresponding x - ray wavelength of 1.33 nm at large scattering angles ( @xmath38 ) . using a distance between sample and detector of only @xmath39 mm </S>",
    "<S> , our rexs setup is sensitive to all three components of the magnetic reciprocal space vectors , whereas sans only detects the two components perpendicular to the incoming neutron beam . also , the x - ray attenuation length at the cu @xmath2 peak maximum is 94 nm , which for the chosen geometry gives a sampling depth of 34 nm corresponding to 38 unit cells . </S>",
    "<S> hence , rexs only probes a depth that is comparable to the helical wavelength , and is ideal for studying near - surface magnetic structures . </S>",
    "<S> it has to be mentioned that the influence of the surface on the complex magnetic texture of the skyrmion lattice remains an open question . </S>",
    "<S> the surface , as a boundary of abruptly changing properties , may induce extraordinary electronic  @xcite or magnetic  @xcite properties in strongly correlated electron systems , and similar effects may also be expected for @xmath40 systems  @xcite . commonly employed techniques , such as sans or lorentz transmission electron microscopy , are insensitive to surface effects . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our rexs experiment allows for very short exposure times on the order of one millisecond and video rate dynamic imaging .     </S>",
    "<S> plane at @xmath24=1 , obtained from processing the ccd image ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( c )  summed images in the conical state at @xmath35=@xmath41 . </S>",

    "<S> ( g )  mfm image of the skyrmion lattice obtained in an out - of - plane field of 31  mt . </S>",
    "<S> the fourier transform ( h ) reveals the hexagonal pattern in agreement with the rexs data . </S>",
    "<S> , width=319 ]    figure  [ fig_2 ] shows representative rexs data for the different magnetic phases of cu@xmath5oseo@xmath6 . in order to acquire the magnetic satellites , we collected reciprocal space maps  ( rsms ) around the ( 0,0,1 ) peak . at fixed @xmath35 , </S>",
    "<S> rsms are obtained by rocking @xmath34 by @xmath43 in @xmath44 steps around the ( 0,0,1 ) diffraction condition , while keeping the ccd detector angle coupled . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a series of ccd images of these @xmath34 - 2@xmath45 scans . </S>",
    "<S> adding together such a series yields an integrated diffraction pattern that reveals the symmetry of the magnetic satellites relative to the ( 0,0,1 ) peak . </S>",
    "<S> however , it does not directly provide quantitative information in reciprocal space . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed experimental methods and explanations can be found in the supporting information . </S>",
    "<S> the large intensity maximum at the center of each image is the ( 0,0,1 ) diffraction peak , while the vertical streak is ascribed to the blooming of the ccd pixels . </S>",
    "<S> the observed ( 0,0,1 ) peak is rather strong , despite being crystallographically forbidden for space group @xmath7 ( see figure [ fig_1]b , c ) . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this effect to templeton scattering , where the anisotropic third - rank tensor stemming from the mixed dipole - quadrupole term allows for the extinction peak to appear for non - centrosymmetric crystals at the x - ray resonance condition  @xcite .    figure  [ fig_2]a shows the sum of ccd images in zero field ( without the magnets mounted ) . around the central ( 0,0,1 ) peak </S>",
    "<S> we observe four clear magnetic satellites that correspond to the helical state , together with weak maxima arising from higher - order or double scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the map of the @xmath42 plane at @xmath46 is shown in figure [ fig_2]b where the ( 0,0,1 ) peak is manually removed in order to increase the contrast . </S>",

    "<S> correspond to 55 - 56.5 nm in real space and easy @xmath10 axes for the helical propagation , in agreement with sans data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the slightly reduced helix wavelength may be associated with surface effects .    in the conical state , </S>",
    "<S> the propagation vector is aligned along the field direction , and for @xmath35=@xmath36 the resulting satellites at ( 0,0,1@xmath47@xmath48 ) are not visible in the integrated image from the coupled @xmath34 - 2@xmath45 scans . tilting the field , however , leads to a tilt of the conical propagation vectors relative to the @xmath24-direction . the resulting sum over ccd images </S>",
    "<S> is shown in figure [ fig_2]c for @xmath35=@xmath41 , where a chain of vertically aligned maxima is characteristic of pronounced higher - order scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this has not been observed before and may be attributed to anharmonicities that are induced at the surface of the sample . </S>",

    "<S> however , this scenario will generate great magnetization discontinuities and artificial topological defects that cost much more energy , leading to an extremely unstable state . </S>",

    "<S> the depinning of the skyrmion lattice allows the surface anisotropy to become dominant , therefore the propagation direction becomes arbitrary . </S>",
    "<S> eventually a multidomain skyrmion state is formed , as observed in figure [ fig_3 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , another important ingredient that may be responsible for the multidomain skyrmion state is the magnetoelectric coupling that separates cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 from other cubic chiral magnets . </S>",
    "<S> calculations suggest that a magnetic field along @xmath10 results in low overall values of the local electric polarization,@xcite consistent with a single - domain skyrmion lattice for fields along [ 001 ] . on the other hand , magnetic fields along other directions lead to large in - plane or out - of - plane electric dipole moments . </S>",
    "<S> the complex interplay of the magnetic and electric dipole moments , in combination with the delicate cubic anisotropy @xcite , may finally induce the formation of multiple domains . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption is also corroborated by the reorientation of the skyrmion lattice in external electrical fields.@xcite in order to distinguish between these contributions , further studies focusing on the magnetoelectric coupling in cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 and on a systematic comparison of bulk and surface properties are required . in particular </S>",

    "<S> more significantly , for the skyrmion lattice , we reproducibly induced the condensation of multiple domains with different in - plane orientations by tilting the magnetic field , offering a new tuning parameter for the manipulation of this topologically non - trivial state . note that for device applications it is essential to be able to provide an all - electric way to manipulate the domain state , which is , in principle , achievable in magnetoelectric materials such as cu@xmath5oseo@xmath6 . compared to a rigid skyrmion lattice state </S>",
    "<S> , the multidomain state will allow for the encoding of information in individual skyrmion domains  a prerequisite for skyrmion - based memory applications .    </S>",
