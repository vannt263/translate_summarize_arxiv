    "the recent discovery by the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ of two accreting millisecond pulsar transients xte  j1751 - 305  ( @xmath4 ; markwardt et al .",
    "2002 ) and xte  j0929 - 314  ( @xmath5 ; galloway et al .",
    "2002 ) has allowed us to learn about the donors in these ultracompact binaries . at @xmath6 minute",
    "orbital periods , h - rich donors are ruled out ( nelson , rappaport & joss 1986 ) , and he - rich stars ( see podsiadlowski , rappaport & pfahl 2002 for an updated discussion of the range of h / he ratios ) or wds are filling the roche lobe ( rl ) . if a degenerate wd , then the orbital period increases as mass is transferred at the rate set by angular momentum losses from gravity waves , @xmath7 ( see verbunt 1993 ) .",
    "the measured pulsar orbital parameters yield the rl filling companion s mass , @xmath8 , and the minimum mass transfer rate , @xmath9 , which are shown in figure  1 for neutron stars of @xmath10 .",
    "the low @xmath11 s are the likely cause for the transient behavior , as the steady - state outer disk temperature is below these element s ionization temperature ( tsugawa & osaki 1997 ; menou et al .",
    "2002 ) , even if x - ray heating is included at the rate inferred in other x - ray binaries ( dubus , hameury & lasota 2001 ) .",
    "if identical wds are the donors in both of these binaries , then their identical orbital periods would require the same rl filling solutions .",
    "this would constrain the inclination for xte  j0929 - 314  to less than 37 degrees and @xmath12 for both xte  j0929 - 314  and xte  j1751 - 305 .",
    "the dotted lines in figure 2 show the mass - radius relation for rl filling donors of xte  j1751 - 305  ( lower line ) and xte  j0929 - 314  ( upper line ) .",
    "the solid and dashed lines ( which exhibit a maximum radius due to the onset of coulomb physics ) are the cold ( @xmath1 ) wds of zapolsky & salpeter ( 1969 , hereafter zs ) for pure he and c , respectively . a cold he wd will fill the rl for xte  j0929 - 314  ( galloway et al .",
    "2002 ) , whereas there are no cold wd solutions that fill the rl for xte  j1751 - 305(markwardt et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "this evidence for finite @xmath13 wds motivated my calculations shown in figure 2 by the solid and dashed lines that diverge at low @xmath14 .",
    "these models ( see  2 ) are for he at @xmath15 and @xmath16 and c at @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "these provide rl filling solutions , but do nt _ a priori _ differentiate between he or c or any other element that might dominate the donor star .",
    "i consider c wds throughout this paper , as schulz et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have measured a high ne to o ratio in the matter transferred onto nss in ultracompact x - ray binaries ( confirmed by juett , psaltis & chakrabarty 2002 ; homer et al .",
    "2002 ; juett & chakrabarty 2002 ) .",
    "these measurements led schulz et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and juett et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to suggest that the donors in these binaries are the cores of previously crystallized c / o wds .    in  2",
    "i justify ( on evolutionary grounds ) that hot wds are expected , describe the construction of their @xmath19 relations , and point out the existence of a minimum @xmath14 solution for a given @xmath13 .",
    "i put the models in the context of mass donors in  3 and calculate @xmath20 the adiabatic exponent needed to evaluate the stability of mass transfer .",
    "though uncertainties remain regarding the ability of the accretion disk to store angular momentum on long timescales ( verbunt & rappaport 1988 ) , my initial work finds that the expansion of a he wd donor under mass transfer can exceed that of the rl , possibly allowing for the ruderman & shaham ( 1983 ) instability .",
    "the material that fills the rl in these systems today was once the deep interior of an initially more massive wd , so i begin by discussing the extent to which prior evolution ( before rl filling ) can affect the temperature of the current low - mass wds .",
    "there are a few evolutionary scenarios that place a he or c / o wd in a tight enough orbit ( following a common - envelope induced spiral - in ) about a ns that gravity wave emission will place it in contact within 5 - 10 gyr ( rasio , pfahl & rappaport 2000 ; yungelson , nelemans & van den heuvel 2002 ) . in this case",
    "the wd has had some time to cool before initiating rl overflow .",
    "nelemans et al .",
    "( 2001 ) discuss a similar scenario for the origin of am cvn binaries .",
    "the rate at which they cool differentiates he and c / o wds . the larger specific heat of a he wd slows its cooling ( althaus & benvenuto 1997 ; hansen & phinney 1998 ) .",
    "for example , a @xmath21 he wd would have @xmath22 at @xmath23 gyr ( althaus & benvenuto 1997 ) and be liquid when rl filling occurs .",
    "the smaller specific heat of a @xmath24 c / o wd allows it to cool to @xmath25 in 4 gyr and begin crystallization ( salaris et al . 2000 ) .",
    "hence , most c / o wds would be solid prior to rl filling ( this is needed for the enhancement of @xmath26 by fractionation ; schulz et al .",
    "2001 ) and might only melt if heated during the gw inspiral ( iben , tutukov & fedorova 1998 ) .",
    "the other differentiation between such wds comes from their mass , as yungelson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) argue that the mass transfer at the onset of rl filling will be unstable if @xmath27 , excluding traditional c / o wds from ever reaching short orbital periods .",
    "however , yungelson et al . (",
    "2002 ) note that `` hybrid '' wds with c / o cores can have @xmath28 and thus evolve to lower mass systems filling the rl at 20 - 40 minutes .",
    "the inability for the donor wds to cool on the @xmath29 gyr timescale of the mass transfer phase ( rappaport et al .",
    "1987 ) makes it clear that the initial entropy is the minimum value attainable .",
    "all of the entropy is in the liquid ions , which have an adiabatic scaling , @xmath30 ( hernanz et al .",
    "1988 ) , less steep than for an ideal gas ( @xmath31 ) . since @xmath32 , a @xmath33 he wd made by _ adiabatically expanding _",
    "the deep interior of a @xmath34 wd would be a factor of @xmath35 cooler , or @xmath36 for the initial range of @xmath3 s discussed earlier .",
    "of course , any tidal heating will increase @xmath13 ( see  3 ) .",
    "so i have constructed @xmath2 wds of finite @xmath13 that contains the coulomb physics ( from chabrier & potekhin 1988 ) that causes the turnover to constant density `` rocks '' in the mass - radius relation at @xmath37 seen in the zs models in figure 2 .",
    "i have imposed an arbitrary ( but convectively stable ) temperature profile of @xmath38 while integrating hydrostatic balance and mass conservation .",
    "i used the electron equation of state of paczynski ( 1983 ) and halt integrations at the point where the pressure has fallen to @xmath39 of the central value , which avoids the need for an envelope model .",
    "the results are shown in figure 2 and make clear that the temperatures expected from _",
    "adiabatic evolution of a he wd",
    "_ are adequate to provide the slight radius expansion needed to fill the rl for these accreting millisecond pulsars .",
    "this is easier for he wds because of the extra number of ions per electron compared to c / o wds .",
    "white dwarfs made of c / o will need some tidal heating to fill these rls .",
    "i also found that there is a minimum mass solution for a wd of fixed @xmath13 .",
    "this is related to the electron fermi energy of the nearly constant density solutions at low masses and is reflected in the radius divergence of the models in figure 2 at low @xmath14 .",
    "my semi - analytic modeling finds that these finite @xmath13 solutions eventually `` turnover '' to follow a track of @xmath40 , as expected for an ideal gas polytrope ( where @xmath41 ) .",
    "since there is no way to reach these solutions of higher @xmath14 while mass is being lost , these `` evaporative '' endpoints where @xmath42 diverges can only be reached if tidal heating is adequate to keep these models hot while the central density is dropping .",
    "more work remains to actually show that this will eliminate the companion and lead to an isolated millisecond radio pulsar .",
    "barring tidal heating adequate to reach the `` evaporative '' endpoint alluded to in  2 , i will now discuss a possible mass transfer instability .",
    "matter leaving the wd takes angular momentum with it as it settles into the accretion disk .",
    "this angular momentum is returned to the wd via tidal torques once there has been enough time for viscosity to move the material outwards from the splash point .",
    "the timescale for this angular momentum loop to be closed has been considered to be long enough ( or uncertain enough ) that ruderman & shaham ( 1983 ) raised the possibility that a mass transfer instability could occur when the expansion of a low - mass donor ( @xmath43 ) due to mass loss ( measured by @xmath44 of eq .",
    "[ [ eq : nad ] ] ) exceeds that of the rl , measured by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the orbital separation .",
    "the value of @xmath47 presuming the angular momentum `` sink '' of the disk ( using the fitting formula of verbunt & rappaport 1988 ) is shown in figure 3 by the dotted lines for ( from left to right ) @xmath48 & @xmath49 .",
    "ruderman & shaham ( 1983 ) presumed @xmath50 , which was shown to be an overestimate by hut & paczynski ( 1984 ) and bonsema & van den heuvel ( 1985 ) , who found @xmath51 from the zs relation ( shown in figure 3 by the solid[dashed ] lines for he[c ] ) .",
    "these authors noted that a zs model moved the crossing ( @xmath52 ) to such low @xmath14 that the binary might not reach it in a hubble time .",
    "however , for finite @xmath3 he wds , i show that this conclusion is altered .",
    "the solid circles are my evaluation of @xmath53 for the @xmath54 ( set closest to the solid line ) and @xmath55 ( bottom - most set ) he wds of figure 2 and show that the finite entropy model sits between the @xmath1 value and the `` naive '' @xmath56 guess for a perfect gas . for a @xmath57 accretor ,",
    "the instability question is first raised ( since @xmath52 ) when a @xmath16 he wd has @xmath58 .",
    "this will occur about a gyr after mass transfer has started presuming just gravity wave emission .",
    "my evaluations of @xmath44 for c wds at the @xmath13 s of figure 2 never found such a crossing .",
    "the instability question is thus raised for he wds and requires some extra entropy from tidal heating .",
    "the amount of heating is small , as for liquid he to reach @xmath59 from about 1/2 that value ( which it had initially ) requires @xmath60 ( the specific heat in the liquid state is @xmath61 per ion ) .",
    "this energy is comparable to the current rotational energy per gram for a tidally locked wd at the 40 minute orbital period .",
    "hence , only a fraction of the higher rotational energy per gram from the tidally locked wd at a shorter orbital period needs to be deposited to yield @xmath59 today .",
    "the remaining criticism against the mass transfer instability is one of relative timescales ( verbunt & rappaport 1988 ; priedhorsky & verbunt 1988 ) .",
    "the mass - transfer instability most likely grows on a timescale @xmath62 ( verbunt & rappaport 1988 ) , where @xmath63 is the scale height in the wd atmosphere , fixed by the x - ray heating in quiescence from the hot ns ( bildsten & chakrabarty 2001 ) .",
    "the binary spends most of the time undergoing mass transfer to the outer disk , but little to no accretion onto the ns .",
    "bildsten & chakrabarty ( 2001 ) showed that the x - ray emission always detected from ns binaries in quiescence ( see bildsten & rutledge 2001 for an overview ) heat the companion on the side facing the ns . presuming the ns thermal emission is at the level predicted by brown , bildsten & rutledge ( 1998 ) ( giving @xmath64 ) then the wds in xte  j1751 - 305  and xte  j0929 - 314",
    "will have @xmath65 .",
    "s should aid detection of the quiescent counterpart , as the luminosity ( presuming @xmath66 ) will be @xmath67 just from reprocessing the ns s thermal emission . presuming @xmath68 and using the wd radius implied by rl filling , i get @xmath69 for the heated wd face . for the high latitude source xte  j0929 - 314  at @xmath70 kpc ( galloway et al .",
    "2002 ) , this gives @xmath71 .",
    "] the scale height is @xmath72 , yielding @xmath73 .",
    "this is still much longer than the time for viscosity to finally play a role in moving material outwards in the outer accretion disk , most likely allowing for the angular momentum to get back to the donor and move it out , so that @xmath74 .",
    "the adiabatic index is never less than @xmath75 .",
    "however , the isothermal wd response is @xmath76 and mass transfer would be unstable for @xmath77 in a he wd of @xmath78 as long as internal heating can keep the wd isothermal as mass is lost .",
    "these masses are near the values i noted earlier for the `` evaporation '' , namely where the mass - radius relation turns over .",
    "the timing of two accreting millisecond pulsars ( markwardt et al . 2002 ; galloway et al .",
    "2002 ) in ultracompact binaries has probed the wd donor properties to new levels and shown that they are of finite entropy .",
    "this motivated my calculations of low - mass wds of finite @xmath13 that allow for @xmath13 to be constrained . for he wds ,",
    "the implied @xmath13 are nearly that expected just from adiabatic expansion of the initially hot wd that filled the rl . only a small amount of tidal heating is needed .",
    "more tidal heating is needed to make a c / o wd fill the rl .",
    "these finite @xmath3 solutions allowed for a re - evaluation of ruderman & shaham s ( 1983 ) scenario for making isolated millisecond radio pulsars via a mass transfer instability .",
    "i find that the adiabatic mass transfer instability can occur for a hot he wd as long as the angular momentum leaving the rl filling star is not returned to the orbit .",
    "i have thus eliminated one criticism of their model , though the question of angular momentum elimination remains a serious one .",
    "the physics of hot , low - mass wds also yields a minimum mass wd solution for a fixed @xmath13 so that a mass transfer instability can occur if the donor remains isothermal under mass loss .",
    "i thus speculate that an evaporative or mass transfer instability endpoint might occur as long as tidal ( or other ) heating persists at 40 - 80 minute orbital periods .",
    "this work also impacts am cvn binaries , where a low mass he star donates material to a more massive wd ( see solheim 1995 for a review ) .",
    "the larger wd radii lead to more gw emission and a higher @xmath79 than expected for a given @xmath80 .",
    "hence , models which track the wd entropy will fall between the degenerate and non - degenerate models in nelemans et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and depend on both the age of the system when rl filling occurs ( as this fixes the initial wd entropy ) and any tidal heating that occurs during the mass transfer .",
    "if either of the instabilities discussed above occur , then the endpoint of am cvn s could well be a db wd ( e.g. tutukov & yungelson 1996 ) .",
