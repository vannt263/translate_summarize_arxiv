    "the large scale texture of the universe shows a great complexity and variety of observed structures , it shows a strange pattern of filaments , voids and sheets .",

    "namely , the galaxy deep pencil beam surveys ( broadhurst et al . 1988 , 1990 ) found an intriguing periodicity in the very large scale distribution of the luminous matter .",
    "the data consisted of several hundred redshifts of galaxies , coming from four distinct surveys , in two narrow cylindrical volumes into the directions of the north and the south galactic poles of our galaxy , up to redshifts of more than @xmath1 , combined to produce a well sampled distribution of galaxies by redshift on a linear scale extending to @xmath2 mpc . the plot of the numbers of galaxies as a function of redshifts displays a remarkably regular redshift distribution , with most galaxies lying in discrete peaks , with a periodicity over a scale of about @xmath0 mpc comoving size .",
    "it was realized also that the density peaks in the regular space distribution of galaxies in the redshift survey of broadhurst et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , correspond to the location of superclusters , as defined by rich clusters of galaxies in the given direction ( bahcall 1991 ) .",

    "it was shown that a random structure could not explain the observed distribution .",
    "statistical analysis of the deviations from periodicity showed that even for a perfectly regular structure a somewhat favoured direction and/or location within the structure may be required .",
    "the presence of the observed periodicity up to a great distance and in different directions seams rather amazing . having in mind this results and the difficulties that perturbative models encounter in explaining the very large scale structure formation ( namely the existence of the very large characteristic scale and the periodicity of the visible matter distribution )",
    ", we chose another way of exploration , namely , we assume these as a typical new feature characteristic only for very large scales ( @xmath9 mpc ) .",
    "i. e. we consider the possibility that density fluctuations required to explain the present cosmological largest scale structures of the universal texture may have arisen in a different from the standard way , they may be a result from a completely different mechanism not necessarily with gravitational origin .",
    "such a successful mechanism was already proposed ( chizhov & dolgov 1992 ) and analyzed in the framework of high - temperature baryogenesis scenarios . according to the discussed mechanism an additional complex scalar field ( besides inflaton )",
    "is assumed to be present at the inflationary epoch , and it yields the extra power at the very large scale discussed .",
    "primordial baryonic fluctuations are produced during the inflationary period , due to the specific evolution of the space distribution of the complex scalar field , carrying the baryon charge .    in the present work we study the possibility of generating of periodic space distribution of primordial baryon density fluctuations at the end of inflationary stage , applying this mechanism for the case of low temperature baryogenesis with baryon charge condensate of dolgov & kirilova ( 1991 ) .",
    "the preliminary analysis of this problem , provided in chizhov & kirilova ( 1994 ) , proved its usefulness in that case . here",
    "we provide detail analysis of the evolution of the baryon density perturbations from the inflationary epoch till the baryogenesis epoch and describe the evolution of the spatial distribution of the baryon density .",
    "the production of matter - antimatter asymmetry in this scenario proceeds generally at low energies ( @xmath10 gev ) .",
    "this is of special importance having in mind that the low - temperature baryogenesis scenarios are the preferred ones , as far as for their realization in the postinflationary stage it is not necessary to provide considerable reheating temperature typical for gut high temperature baryogenesis scenarios . hence , the discussed model ( dolgov & kirilova 1991 ) has several attractive features : ( a ) it is compatible with the inflationary models as far as it does not suffer from the problem of insufficient reheating .",
    "( b ) generally , this scenario evades the problem of washing out the previously produced baryon asymmetry at the electroweak transition .",
    "( c ) and as it will be proved in the following it may solve the problem of large scale periodicity of the visible matter .",
    "it was already discussed in ( dolgov 1992 , chizhov & dolgov 1992 ) a periodic in space baryonic density distribution can be obtained provided that the following assumptions are realized :    \\(a ) there exists a complex scalar field @xmath11 with a mass small in comparison with the hubble parameter during inflation .",
    "\\(b ) its potential contains nonharmonic terms .",
    "\\(c ) a condensate of @xmath11 forms during the inflationary stage and it is a slowly varying function of space points .    all these requirements can be naturally fulfilled in our scenario of the scalar field condensate baryogenesis ( dolgov & kirilova 1991 ) and in low temperature baryogenesis scenarios based on the affleck and dine mechanism ( affleck & dine 1985 ) .    in case when the potential of @xmath11 is not strictly harmonic the oscillation period depends on the amplitude @xmath12 , and it on its turn depends on @xmath13 . therefore",
    ", a monotonic initial space distribution will soon result into spatial oscillations of @xmath11 ( chizhov & dolgov 1992 ) .",
    "correspondingly , the baryon charge , contained in @xmath11 : @xmath14 , will have quasi - periodic behavior . during universe expansion the characteristic scale of the variation of @xmath15 will be inflated up to a cosmologically interesting size . then",
    ", if @xmath11 has not reached the equilibrium point till the baryogenesis epoch @xmath16 , the baryogenesis would make a snapshot of the space distribution of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and thus the present periodic distribution of the visible matter may date from the spatial distribution of the baryon charge contained in the @xmath11 field at the advent of the @xmath19-conservation epoch .",
    "density fluctuations with a comoving size today of @xmath20 mpc reentered the horizon at late times at a redshift of about 10 000 and a mass of @xmath21 .",
    "after recombination the jeans mass becomes less than the horizon and the fluctuations of this large mass begin to grow .",
    "we propose that these baryonic fluctuations , periodically spaced , lead to an enhanced formation of galaxy superclusters at the peaks of baryon overdensity .",
    "the concentration of baryons into periodic shells may have catalysed also the clustering of matter coming from the inflaton decays onto these  baryonic nuclei \" .",
    "after baryogenesis proceeded , superclusters may have formed at the high peaks of the background field ( the baryon charge carrying scalar field , we discuss ) .",
    "( see the results of the statistical analysis ( plionis 1995 ) , confirming the idea that clusters formed at the high peaks of background field , which is analogous to our assumption . ) we imply that afterwards the self gravity mechanisms might have optimized the arrangement of this structure into the thin regularly spaced dense baryonic shells and voids in between with the characteristic size of @xmath22 observed today .",
    "the analysis showed that in the framework of our scenario both the generation of the baryon asymmetry and the periodic distribution of the baryon density can be explained simultaneously as due to the evolution of a complex scalar field .",
    "moreover , for a certain range of parameters the model predicts that the universe may consist of sufficiently separated baryonic and antibaryonic shells .",
    "this possibility was discussed in more detail elsewhere ( kirilova 1998 ) .",
    "this is an interesting possibility as far as the observational data of antiparticles in cosmic rays and the gamma rays data do not rule out the possibility for existence of superclusters of galaxies of antimatter in the universe ( steigman 1976 , ahlen et al .",
    "1982 , 1988 , stecker 1985 , 1989 , gao et al .",
    "the observations exclude the possibility of noticeable amount of antimatter in our galaxy , however , they are not sensitive enough to test the existence of antimatter extragalactic regions",

    "future searches for antimatter among cosmic rays are expected to increase this lower bound by an order of magnitude .",
    "namely , the reach of the antimatter spectrometer is claimed to exceed 150 mpc ( ahlen et al . 1982 ) and its sensitivity is three orders of magnitudes better than that of the previous experiments ( battiston 1997 , plyaskin et al .",

    "the following section describes the baryogenesis model and the last section deals with the generation of the periodicity of the baryon density and discusses the results .",
    "our analysis was performed in the framework of the low temperature non - gut baryogenesis model described in ( dolgov & kirilova 1991 ) , based on the affleck and dine susy gut motivated mechanism for generation of the baryon asymmetry ( affleck & dine 1985 ) . in this section",
    "we describe the main characteristics of the baryogenesis model , which are essential for the investigation of the periodicity in the next section . for more detail",
    "please see the original paper .",
    "the essential ingredient of the model is a squark condensate @xmath11 with a nonzero baryon charge .",
    "it naturally appears in supersymmetric theories and is a scalar superpartner of quarks .",
    "the condensate @xmath24 is formed during the inflationary period as a result of the enhancement of quantum fluctuations of the @xmath11 field ( vilenkin & ford 1982 , linde 1982 , bunch & davies 1978 , starobinsky 1982 ) : @xmath25 .",
    "the baryon charge of the field is not conserved at large values of the field amplitude due to the presence of the b nonconserving self - interaction terms in the field s potential . as a result ,",
    "a condensate of a baryon charge ( stored in @xmath26 ) is developed during inflation with a baryon charge density of the order of @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the hubble parameter at the inflationary stage .",
    "after inflation @xmath11 starts to oscillate around its equilibrium point with a decreasing amplitude .",
    "this decrease is due to the universe expansion and to the particle production by the oscillating scalar field ( dolgov & kirilova 1990 , 1991 ) .",
    "here we discuss the simple case of particle production when @xmath11 decays into fermions and there is no parametric resonance .",
    "we expect that the case of decays into bosons due to parametric resonance ( kofman et al .",
    "1994 , 1996 , shtanov et al .",
    "1995 , boyanovski et al .",
    "1995 , yoshimura 1995 , kaiser 1996 ) , especially in the broad resonance case , will lead to an explosive decay of the condensate , and hence an insufficient baryon asymmetry .",
    "therefore , we explore the more promising case of @xmath11 decaying into fermions .    in the expanding universe",
    "@xmath11 satisfies the equation -a^-2 ^ 2_i+3h+ 1 4+u_=0 , where @xmath29 is the scale factor and @xmath30 .",
    "the potential @xmath31 is chosen in the form u()=_12||^4 + _ 24(^4+^*4)+_34||^2 ( ^2+^*2 ) the mass parameters of the potential are assumed small in comparison to the hubble constant during inflation @xmath32 . in supersymmetric theories the constants @xmath33 are of the order of the gauge coupling constant @xmath4 .",
    "a natural value of @xmath34 is @xmath35 gev .",
    "the initial values for the field variables can be derived from the natural assumption that the energy density of @xmath11 at the inflationary stage is of the order @xmath36 , then @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the term @xmath39 in the equations of motion explicitly accounts for the eventual damping of @xmath11 as a result of particle creation processes .",
    "the explicit account for the effect of particle creation processes in the equations of motion was first provided in ( chizhov & kirilova 1994 , kirilova & chizhov 1996 ) .",
    "the production rate @xmath40 was calculated in ( dolgov & kirilova 1990 ) . for simplicity",
    "here we have used the perturbation theory approximation for the production rate @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the frequency of the scalar field . for @xmath43 , @xmath40",
    "considerably exceeds the rate of the ordinary decay of the field @xmath44 .",
    "fast oscillations of @xmath11 after inflation result in particle creation due to the coupling of the scalar field to fermions @xmath45 , where @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , the amplitude of @xmath11 is damped as @xmath47 and the baryon charge , contained in the @xmath11 condensate , is considerably reduced .",
    "it was discussed in detail in dolgov & kirilova ( 1991 ) that for a constant @xmath40 this reduction is exponential and generally , for a natural range of the model s parameters , the baryon asymmetry is waved away till baryogenesis epoch as a result of the particle creation processes .",
    "fortunately , in the case without flat directions of the potential , the production rate is a decreasing function of time , so that the damping process may be slow enough for a considerable range of acceptable model parameters values of @xmath34 , @xmath48 , @xmath4 , and @xmath49 , so that the baryon charge contained in @xmath11 may survive until the advent of the @xmath19-conservation epoch .",
    "generally , in cases of more effective particle creation , like in the case with flat directions in the potential , or in the case when @xmath11 decays spontaneously into bosons due to parametric resonance , the discussed mechanism of the baryon asymmetry generation can not be successful .",
    "hence , it can not be useful also for the generation of the matter periodicity .",
    "when inflation is over and @xmath11 relaxes to its equilibrium state , its coherent oscillations produce an excess of quarks over antiquarks ( or vice versa ) depending on the initial sign of the baryon charge condensate .",
    "this charge , diluted further by some entropy generating processes , dictates the observed baryon asymmetry .",
    "this epoch when @xmath11 decays to quarks with non - zero average baryon charge and thus induces baryon asymmetry we call baryogenesis epoch .",
    "the baryogenesis epoch @xmath16 for our model coincides with the advent of the baryon conservation epoch , i.e. the time after which the mass terms in the equations of motion can not be neglected . in the original version ( affleck &",
    "dine 1985 ) this epoch corresponds to energies @xmath50 gev .",
    "however , as it was already explained , the amplitude of @xmath11 may be reduced much more quickly due to the particle creation processes and as a result , depending on the model s parameters the advent of this epoch may be considerably earlier . for the correct estimation of @xmath16 and the value of the generated baryon asymmetry , it is essential to account for the eventual damping of the field s amplitude due to particle production processes by an external time - dependent scalar field , which could lead to a strong reduction of the baryon charge contained in the condensate .",
    "in order to explore the spatial distribution behavior of the scalar field and its evolution during universe expansion it is necessary to analyze eq.(1 ) . we have made the natural assumption that initially @xmath11 is a slowly varying function of the space coordinates @xmath51 .",
    "the space derivative term can be safely neglected because of the exponential rising of the scale factor @xmath52 .",
    "then the equations of motion for @xmath53 read @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 .    in case when at the end of inflation",
    "the universe is dominated by a coherent oscillations of the inflaton field @xmath57 , the hubble parameter is @xmath58 . in this case",
    "it is convenient to make the substitutions @xmath59 , @xmath60 where @xmath61 . the functions @xmath62 and @xmath63 satisfy the equations    c u+ 0.75 _ u ( u-2u^-1)+ u[(+_3 ) u^2+v^2 - 2 ^ -2]=0 + v+ 0.75 _ v ( v-2v^-1)+ v[(-_3 ) v^2+u^2 - 2 ^ -2]=0 .",

    "we have numerically calculated the baryon charge evolution @xmath71 for different initial conditions of the field corresponding to the accepted initial monotonic space distribution of the field ( see figs .",
    "the numerical analysis confirmed the important role of particle creation processes for baryogenesis models and large scale structure periodicity ( chizhov & kirilova 1994 , 1996 ) which were obtained from an approximate analytical solution . in the present work we have accounted for particle creation",

    "3 ) . as it was expected , in the case of nonharmonic field s potential , the initially monotonic space behavior",
    "is quickly replaced by space oscillations of @xmath11 , because of the dependence of the period on the amplitude , which on its turn is a function of @xmath13 . as a result in different points different periods",
    "are observed and space behavior of @xmath11 becomes quasiperiodic .",
    "correspondingly , the space distribution of the baryon charge contained in @xmath11 becomes quasiperiodic as well .",
    "therefore , the space distribution of baryons at the moment of baryogenesis is found to be periodic .",
    "the observed space distribution of the visible matter today is defined by the space distribution of the baryon charge of the field @xmath11 at the moment of baryogenesis @xmath16 , @xmath73 .",
    "so , that at present the visible part of the universe consists of baryonic shells , divided by vast underdense regions .",

    "the parameters of the model ensuring the necessary observable size between the matter domains belong to the range of parameters for which the generation of the observed value of the baryon asymmetry may be possible in the model of scalar field condensate baryogenesis .",
    "_ this is an attractive feature of this model because both the baryogenesis and the large scale structure periodicity of the universe can be explained simply through the evolution of a single scalar field .",
    "moreover , for some model s variations the presence of vast antibaryonic regions in the universe is predicted .",
    "this is an interesting possibility as far as the observational data do not rule out the possibility of antimatter superclusters in the universe .",
    "the model proposes an elegant mechanism for achieving a sufficient separation between regions occupied by baryons and those occupied by antibaryons , necessary in order to inhibit the contact of matter and antimatter regions with considerable density .",
    "it is interesting , having in mind the positive results of this investigation , to provide a more precise study of the question for different possibilities of particle creation and their relevance for the discussed scenario of baryogenesis and periodicity generation . in the case of narrow - band resonance decay",
    "the final state interactions regulate the decay rate , parametric amplification is effectively suppressed ( allahverdi & campbell 1997 ) and does not drastically enhance the decay rate . therefore , we expect that this case will be interesting to explore",
