    "the number of stars in the mass interval @xmath1 is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the logarithmic slope is @xmath4 such that @xmath5 for the power - law form , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "the _ logarithmic imf _ is @xmath8 , which is useful when counting stars in logarithmic mass intervals .",
    "the _ stellar imf _ is the distribution of stellar masses that results from a single star - formation burst . because essentially all stars form in clusters ( lada & lada 2003 ) we expect to measure the stellar imf in young star clusters before they disperse to the field of a galaxy .",
    "the stellar imf is one of the most fundamental distribution functions of astrophysics , and consequently a huge effort has been invested into constraining its shape since its first formulation in 1954 by salpeter ( 1955 ) ( at the australian national university in canberra ) as a single power - law with @xmath9 for @xmath10 , based on an early analysis of star - counts in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "a further milestone in this remarkable scientific enterprise is given by miller & scalo ( 1979 ) who made a large effort in constraining the imf to mass ranges outside the salpeter limits and who deduced that the stellar imf flattens below @xmath11 .",
    "scalo ( 1986 ) re - considered this problem in what today remains the most significant piece of work in this topic by studying all of the then available observational constraints on local star counts , the shape of the stellar luminosity function , the mass - luminosity relation , stellar evolution for early - type stars and the vertical structure of the milky way ( mw ) , and suggested the imf to turn - down below about @xmath12 , which had important implications in trying to understand the nature and occurrence of unseen matter in the disk of the mw .",
    "an important improvement in understanding the shape of the imf for low - mass stars was contributed by kroupa , tout & gilmore ( 1993 and two prior papers ) who proposed that the strong maximum near @xmath13 in the luminosity function of solar - neighbourhood stars stems from an inflection in the mass  luminosity relation , which in turn results from the association of h@xmath14 molecules and the onset of full convection below about @xmath12 .",
    "this revised the imf to be essentially flat below @xmath12 , but the inclusion of corrections for unresolved multiple systems and detailed modelling of star - counts with malmquist bias and galactic - disk structure solved the disagreement between local and deep star counts and thereby increased the slope of the imf below @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting form of the two - part power - law imf for late - type stars ( @xmath15 ) has been verified by reid , gizis & hawley ( 2002 ) using revised local star - counts that incorporate hipparcos distances . for @xmath16 the imf",
    "is proposed by reid et al . to have @xmath17 , while scalo ( 1986 ) derived @xmath18 , which is supported by the work of yuan ( 1992 ) .",
    "written out ,    @xmath19 with exponents @xmath20 is the ktg93 imf after extension to the sub - stellar mass range ( kroupa 2001 ; 2002 ) .",
    "this imf is the _ galaxial imf _ as it is derived from galactic field stars , and , as we will see further below , differs from the _ stellar imf_. the multi - power - law description is used merely for convenience , as it allows us to leave the low - mass part of the imf unchanged while experimenting with different slopes above , say , @xmath21 .",
    "other functional forms have been suggested ( miller & scalo 1978 ; larson 1998 ; chabrier 2001 ) , but these bear the disadvantage that the whole functional form reacts to changes in the parameters .",
    "such parametrisations are useful for studying possible changes of the stellar imf with cosmological epoch .",
    "to constrain the stellar imf we need detailed observations of young populations in star clusters and ob associations .",
    "the hope is that young clusters are not yet dynamically evolved so that the initial stellar population becomes evident .",
    "however , as dynamical modelling of young clusters containing o stars shows , significant dynamical evolution is already well established at an age of 1  myr as a result of ( i ) the dense conditions before gas removal such that the binary - star population changes significantly away from its primordial properties , and ( ii ) rapid cluster expansion as a result of violent gas expulsion ( kroupa , aarseth & hurley 2001 ) .",
    "this would lead to a systematic biasing of the observed stellar imf against low - mass members if the cluster was significantly mass - segregated prior to gas expulsion ( moraux , kroupa & bouvier 2004 ) .",
    "in addition to these difficulties come obscuration by natal gas and dust and the large uncertainties in deriving ages and masses given inadequate theoretical models of stars that are still relaxing from their accretion history , rotating rapidly , are variable and active , and have circum - stellar material .",
    "the task of inferring the stellar imf is thus terribly involved and uncertain .",
    "nevertheless , substantial progress has been achieved .",
    "given that there are many star clusters and ob associations , a large body of literature has been amassing over the decades , and scalo ( 1998 ) compiled the then available imf slope vs mass data .",
    "an updated form of this plot is shown in fig .",
    "[ krfig1 ] , and as can be seen , the stellar imf essentially follows the above galaxial imf below @xmath21 ( after correcting the observations for unresolved multiple systems ) , whilst having a salpeter slope above @xmath21 .",
    "striking is that large and small magellanic cloud data ( solid triangles ) are not systematically different to the more metal rich mw data ( solid circles ) .",
    "a systematic difference between dense clusters and sparse ob associations is also not evident ( massey 1998 ) .",
    "notable is that the scatter is large above @xmath21 but constant and that it can be fitted by a gauss distribution of @xmath22 values centred on the salpeter index ( kroupa 2002 ) .",
    "the scatter can be understood to result from statistical fluctuations and stellar - dynamical evolution of the clusters and the dynamically evolved ob associations ( elmegreen 1999 ; kroupa 2001 ) .",
    "these observations on the @xmath22-plot thus point to a remarkable uniformity of the stellar imf , which can thus be summarised by the multi - power - law form of eq .",
    "[ eq : imf ] but with @xmath23 some apparently significant deviations from this _ standard _ or _ canonical _ imf do occur though ( fig .",
    "[ krfig2 ] ) , and it will be the aim of observers and modellers alike to try to understand why the two clusters of similar age , the pleiades ( hambly et al . 1999 ) and m35 ( barrado y navascus et al .",
    "2001 ) , appear to have such different mass functions below @xmath11 .",
    "the existence of a universal canonical stellar imf is therefore supported by the majority of data .",
    "it has a salpeter index above about @xmath11 .",
    "but this result uncovers a possibly unsettling discrepancy between this stellar imf ( eq .",
    "[ eq : canonicalimf ] ) and the galaxial imf ( eq .",
    "[ eq : imf ] ) which was found to be steeper for @xmath24 .",
    "the distribution of stellar masses in an entire galaxy results from the addition of all star - forming events ever to have occurred , @xmath25 this is the integrated _ galaxial imf _ ( igimf ) , i.e. the imf integrated over space and time . here",
    "@xmath26 is the mf of embedded clusters , and @xmath27 are the minimum and maximum cluster masses , respectively .",
    "note that the igimf becomes indistinguishable to the field - star imf in galaxies in which presently on - going star - formation contributes insignificantly to the already present stellar population , and also that @xmath28 does not correspond to the shining matter distribution for @xmath16 . to evaluate this",
    "we need to consider only the recently formed stars .    within each cluster stars",
    "are formed following the canonical imf . however , small star - forming cloud cores , similar to the individual groups containing a dozen @xmath29 in gas seen in taurus  auriga , for example , can never from o  stars . since the stellar imf has been found to be essentially invariant , even when comparing the small groups of dozens of pre - main sequence stars in taurus  auriga with the rich orion nebula cluster ( kroupa et al .",
    "2003 ) , constructing a young cluster population is mathematically equivalent to randomly sampling the canonical imf .",
    "however , sampling without a mass constraint would in principle allow small star - forming regions to form very massive stars , which would be in violation to the observations according to which massive stars are formed in rich clusters . we therefore choose stars randomly from the canonical imf but impose a mass - limit on the mass in stars that can form from a molecular cloud core with mass @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the star - formation efficiency ( lada & lada 2003 ) , @xmath32 where @xmath33 . in each cluster",
    "there is one single most - massive star with mass @xmath34 , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the fundamental upper stellar mass limit ( weidner & kroupa 2004a ) .",
    "this set of two equations needs to be solved numerically to obtain @xmath37 that enters eq .",
    "[ eq : igimf ] .",
    "we note that our usage of an @xmath38 correlation disagrees with elmegreen s ( 2004 ) conjecture that no such relation exists .",
    "this problem is dealt with further by weidner & kroupa ( 2004b ) .",
    "the slope , @xmath39 , of the star cluster imf , @xmath40 , is constrained by observations :    * @xmath41 : @xmath42 locally ( lada & lada 2003 ) ; * @xmath43 : @xmath44 for lmc and smc ( hunter et al . 2003 ) * @xmath45 : @xmath46 for antennae clusters ( zhang & fall 1999 ) .    assuming @xmath47 and the canonical imf slope @xmath48 for stars above @xmath49 we get the resulting igimf shown in fig .",
    "[ krfig3 ] which is considerably steeper than the salpeter imf ( see kroupa & weidner 2003 for more details ) .    in fig .",
    "[ krfig4 ] the slope of the igimf , @xmath50 for @xmath24 , is studied for various values of @xmath39 and @xmath22 .",
    "the effect is more pronounced the steeper ( larger @xmath39 ) the cluster mass function is .",
    "this has a profound impact on the evolution of galaxies as can be deduced from fig .",
    "[ krfig5 ] . in the upper panel",
    "is shown the number of white dwarfs per star relative to the salpeter imf . for @xmath39 values above 2",
    "it drops considerably , and in the lower panel , were the number of supernovae of type  ii ( snii ) per star is plotted , the effect is even stronger . for @xmath9 and @xmath51",
    "there are 89% of white dwarfs but only 35% of snii compared to a salpeter imf .",
    "the star - formation rate ( sfr ) of a galaxy is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the mass in clusters assembled in time interval @xmath54 .",
    "lets assume for the moment that the cluster imf , @xmath26 , is also invariant , and that @xmath55 is fixed while @xmath56 may vary .",
    "then the @xmath56 vs @xmath57 relation can be calculated for different @xmath54 .",
    "a comparison of this simple theory with empirical data is provided in fig .",
    "[ krfig7 ] .",
    "the figure plots empirical maximum star - cluster masses vs galaxial global sfrs , and a fit to these data yields @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the mass - to - light ratio .",
    "[ krfig6 ] shows this relation .",
    "interestingly , the theory is nicely consistent with the data for @xmath60 and @xmath61  myr , which suggests that the cluster imf may indeed be quite invariant , and that a galaxy is able to assemble complete star - cluster systems within typically 10  myr independent of the sfr ( weidner , kroupa & larsen 2004 ) .    with the use of eq .",
    "[ eq : meclsfr ] the time - dependent igimf of galaxies of different types can be calculated : on specifying a sfr , @xmath56 follows ( eq .  [ eq : meclsfr ] ) and from eq .",
    "[ eq : igimf ] the galaxial imf can be computed in dependence of the star - formation history by adding up all galaxial imfs generated in each multiple-@xmath54-epoch until the present . as a straight - forward result",
    "we expect the galaxial imf to be steeper ( larger @xmath50 ) for low - mass galaxies than for massive galaxies because the average sfr is lower for the former .",
    "we also expect a dependence of the galaxial imf on the star - formation history ( sfh ) of a galaxy .",
    "these expectations are born out .",
    "the final igimf of a dwarf or low - surface brightness galaxy with a stellar mass of @xmath62 assuming a stellar imf slope @xmath63 is shown in fig .",
    "[ krfig7 ] , and in fig .",
    "[ krfig8 ] for @xmath64 . in the case with @xmath63",
    "three sfhs are considered . a single burst of star - formation followed by no further formation ( solid line ) , an episodic sfr with  100 myr long peaks every 900  myr ( long - dashed line ) and a constant sfr over 14  gyr ( dotted line ) .",
    "the influence of the sfh on the igimf is significant for galaxies with a small mass in stars . for a steeper input imf ( fig .",
    "[ krfig8 ] ) this effect is even more pronounced .",
    "such a steep imf slope may possibly be the true value if the observationally derived stellar imfs for massive stars are corrected for unresolved binaries ( sagar & richtler 1991 ) . in galaxies with a large stellar mass , @xmath65 ( fig .",
    "[ krfig9 ] ) , the sensitivity of @xmath66 on the sfh becomes negligible because the average sfr is always large enough to sample the star - cluster imf to the fundamental stellar upper mass limit . in summary , the igimf slope , @xmath66 ,",
    "is shown as a function of @xmath67 in fig .",
    "[ krfig10 ] .",
    "the differently shaded regions are for single burst , episodic and a constant sfr , respectively",
    ".    what implications beyond a reduction of the number of snii do these findings have ?",
    "the observed diversity of metallicities in different dwarf galaxies of rather similar mass ( mateo 1998 ; garnett 2004 ) may be explained by this effect without invoking individually fitted effective yields as are needed in chemo - dynamical models with standard imfs ( lanfranchi & matteucci 2004 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "our models indicate that massive spirals and ellipticals should show less variations in the igimf and thus metallicity due to their high average sfr which is actually what is observed in nearby galaxies ( fig .",
    "9 in garnett 2004 ) .",
    "current available models for the chemical evolution of galaxies have difficulties to reproduce the chemical abundances in disc galaxies with a standard galaxial salpeter imf , as it produces too many metals ( portinari et al .",
    "this problem may be resolvable by the model presented here but detailed chemo - dynamical calculations incorporating our approach need to be computed .",
    "finally , the mass - to - light ratia of galaxies are too low for models that assume invariant galaxial salpeter imfs ; the real @xmath0 ratia are larger .",
    "* igimfs are steeper than the stellar imf . *",
    "therefore there are significantly fewer snii per g - type star per galaxy . * chemical enrichment and @xmath0 ratios of galaxies calculated with an invariant salpeter imf are wrong .",
    "* the igimfs vary from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "* dwarf galaxies show the largest variations : @xmath68  for @xmath69 ( salpeter ) and @xmath70 . *",
    "the sensitivity of the igimf on the sfh increases with @xmath71 . the true value of @xmath72 for the stellar imf may actually be significantly larger than  2.35 : * understanding the corrections for unresolved multiples on the derivation of the high - mass part of the stellar imf is of fundamental importance !              garnett d.r . , 2004 , in : cosmochemistry",
