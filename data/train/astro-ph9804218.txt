    "oscillations in multi - periodic variables such as @xmath0 scuti , roap and @xmath7 cephei stars have been observed extensively during the past 20 years . but even with high - quality data , it is still extremely difficult to identify which modes are being detected .",
    "kjeldsen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) used a new technique to detect solar - like oscillations in the bright g sub - giant @xmath8 boo through their effect on the equivalent widths of the balmer lines .",
    "a subsequent discussion by bedding et al .  ( @xcite ) of the sensitivity of different observables to modes with different degree @xmath1 suggested that one can determine the @xmath1-value of a given mode by combining measurements of absorption - line equivalent widths with simultaneous photometric observations .",
    "to test this idea , we chose the bright and well - studied @xmath0  scuti star fg  vir .",
    "fg vir ( hd 106384 ; @xmath9 ) is a multi - periodic @xmath0  scuti star .",
    "it has a main pulsation period close to 1.9 hours and shows a fairly complex oscillation spectrum .",
    "this star has been studied extensively during the last few years , resulting in the detection of at least 24 well - determined frequencies between 100 and 400  @xmath3hz , with amplitudes from 0.8 to 22 milli - magnitudes ( mmag ; breger et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) . because of its slow rotation ( which reduces the complicating effects of rotational splitting ) and the large number of detected frequencies ( some of which are probably _ g _ modes ) , fg vir is one of the most promising candidates for performing asteroseismology on a @xmath0 scuti variable . observations and models of this star",
    "have been presented by dawson et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , breger et al .  ( @xcite ) and guzik & bradley ( @xcite ) .    by choosing a star like fg vir we have the advantage of knowing the frequencies in advance .",
    "we are therefore able to determine the oscillation amplitudes and phases with high precision .",
    "the aim of this paper is to identify the @xmath1 values of the observed modes and to compare the oscillation frequencies with a pulsation model .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the observations presented in this paper was given by viskum  et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) , while results on radial velocity measurements were given by viskum et al .  ( @xcite ) .",
    "we obtained intermediate - resolution spectra of fg vir using the dfosc spectrograph mounted on the danish 1.54-m at la silla , chile and the coud spectrograph ( b grating ) on the 74-inch telescope at mt .",
    "stromlo , australia , during a period of more than two weeks in may 1996 .",
    "a journal of the observations is given in table  [ log1 ] .",
    "in total we obtained 652 spectra of fg  vir .",
    "the dfosc spectrograph was used in the echelle mode , covering a wavelength region from 4600 to 8000 at a resolution of @xmath10 .",
    "six echelle orders were recorded , each covering about 600 and with an overlap between adjacent orders of about 370   . a s / n ratio of 250360 was reached in the dfosc data with a typical exposure time of 460s .",
    "the s / n ratio was determined by measuring the standard deviation of the intensity of the normalized spectrum in two spectral windows free of absorption lines .",
    "stromlo data consisted of single - order spectra , with a wavelength coverage of 6000 to 7000 .",
    "the dispersion was 0.49 / pixel , with a resolution of about 1.5 which was set by the slit width of 2 arcsec .",
    "the typical exposure time was 400s .",
    ".journal of spectroscopic observations of fg  vir [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath11 assuming @xmath12 k and @xmath13 .",
    "+ @xmath14 using distance , @xmath9 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "table  [ hprop ] shows the fundamental properties for fg  vir obtained by combining the hipparcos distance with equations  [ eqlmt ] and  [ eqtrrho ] , without using the asteroseismically determined density .",
    "it can be seen that the asteroseismic properties for fg vir are far more precise than those obtained by using the hipparcos data , even with 100k uncertainty in the temperature .",
    "such calculations show clearly the potential of asteroseismology .",
    "the present analysis is based on three @xmath17 modes out of more than 20 known frequencies .",
    "we have identified modes with @xmath18 and @xmath19 and these modes will contain accurate information on the detailed evolutionary stage of fg vir .",
    "this should provide strong constraints on models computed specifically for fg vir , resulting in a fine - tuned model . the effect from metallicity should also be investigated .    to check our identification of @xmath2 modes , we compared all 24 frequencies published by breger et al .",
    "( @xcite ) with the frequency ratios of radial modes in the 2.2m@xmath20 model .",
    "the highest correlation occurred with the following solution : @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , with a scatter between observed and best - fit theoretical frequencies of about 1@xmath3hz .",
    "these identifications are in full agreement with our own results and give us confidence that we have correctly identified the radial modes in fg vir .",
    "finally , we note that the strongest mode ( @xmath29 ) is likely to be @xmath22 , @xmath4 and is probably undergoing an avoided crossing with a @xmath30-mode .",
    "this would make this mode very interesting for testing a more detailed model .",
    "a periodic trend was evident in the raw ew data for all metal lines and in the two balmer lines .",
    "the same periodicity was seen in all four photometric light curves . the variation is clearly seen after removal of the known pulsation signal and smoothing ( fig .  [ figrot ] ) .",
    "there appears to be a variability with a period of @xmath31 days and a decaying amplitude .",
    "note that the h@xmath32  time series is composed of data from telescopes at two different sites , while the fei and h@xmath32  time series were obtained using different reduction programs .",
    "furthermore , the photometric time series were obtained with a third telescope .",
    "all time series are in phase , indicating that the variation is caused by the same phenomenon .",
    "we propose that this 3.5-day variation is intrinsic to the star and reflects the rotation period of fg vir .",
    "using the asteroseismic radius in table  [ aprop ] , we then obtain @xmath33kms@xmath34 for the equatorial velocity . using the value of @xmath35kms@xmath34 found by mantegazza et al .",
    "( @xcite ) gives @xmath36 for the inclination angle , in agreement with the value of @xmath37 found by mantegazza et al .  from a moments analysis of @xmath25 and @xmath38",
    "we have investigated a new technique to measure the oscillations in @xmath0  scuti stars via changes in the equivalent widths of absorption lines .",
    "an important advantage of this new technique is that only medium - dispersion spectra are needed , which makes the method suitable for small and medium - sized telescopes and for multi - site campaigns .",
    "our main results are summarized below .    *",
    "our detection of oscillations in fg  vir from equivalent - width measurements of h@xmath32 , h@xmath7  and fei lines is an important confirmation of the method developed by kjeldsen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) to search for solar - like oscillations . * from the ratios between oscillation amplitudes measured in ew and the four strmgren filters ( _ uvby _ ) , we have identified @xmath1-values for eight modes in fg  vir . *",
    "we suggest that the two lowest - frequency modes are _ g_-modes , while the strongest mode ( 147.2@xmath3hz ) is a dipole mode . * by comparing the frequencies of radial modes with model calculations , we obtained a precise density and derived a distance that is in excellent agreement with the hipparcos value .",
    "* we detected a long - period variation in the time series with a period of 3.5 days , which we propose is caused by rotation of the star .",
