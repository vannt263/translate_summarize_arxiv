    "et al._@xcite used a polytropic equation - of - state ( eos ) model , providing insight into the 1d physical evolution of imploding spherical plasma liners , and showing that plx - relevant plasma liner kinetic energies of hundreds of kj could result in liner stagnation pressures on the order of 1  mbar sustained for order 1  @xmath0s .",
    "the results of awe _ et al._@xcite indicated high enough plasma temperatures ( 10 s of ev ) for ionization effects , which are not included in a polytropic eos model , to have an appreciable impact on both the predicted peak pressures and temperatures . as some of the initial liner kinetic energy would now be used for ionization , it is expected that the liner may compress less , although the expected drop in thermal energy in the imploding plasma liner due to ionization and radiative loss channels are expected to help compensate .",
    "note that this work and that of awe _ et al._@xcite focus on targetless , self - collapse of the liner , motivated by the goals of the plx project .",

    "we used the helios - cr@xcite 1d radiation - hydrodynamic code and the propaceos@xcite eos and multi - group opacity database to repeat the simulation cases presented in awe _ et al._@xcite in particular , we examined how the detailed eos model affected the liner stagnation pressure @xmath1 ( defined in sec .",

    "section  [ summary ] provides a discussion and summary .",
    "in this section we describe the simulation initial conditions , the codes used , and benchmarking of our own polytropic eos results against the results of awe _",
    "et al._@xcite      the initial conditions used in this work are shown schematically in fig .",

    "et al._@xcite in short , they are intended to span a range of initial plasma liner velocities @xmath7 and kinetic energies @xmath8 from plx - relevant values ( 50  km / s , hundreds of kj ) at the lower end to what might be needed for an mif standoff compression driver@xcite ( @xmath9  km / s , @xmath10  tens of mj ) at the higher end .",
    "the initial liner ion density values @xmath11 are what can be expected based on plasma jet densities that have already been achieved by the plasma guns designed and built by hyperv technologies@xcite for use on plx . in this work",
    ", we assume that discrete plasma jets have merged at @xmath12  cm and formed a spherically symmetric imploding plasma liner with uniform mass density @xmath13 , thickness 25.5  cm , temperature @xmath14  ev , and uniform inward radial velocity @xmath7 .",
    "the effects of non - uniform initial liner profiles are not studied here but are a potential way of optimizing imploding plasma liner performance.@xcite the void region ( fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) is modeled using very low density plasma with mass densities of @xmath15  kg / m@xmath16 ( tabular eos runs ) and @xmath17  kg / m@xmath16 ( polytropic eos runs ) , temperature of 1.0  ev , and the same species as the liner . the different initial void mass densities led to slightly different computational zone setups but did not affect the overall liner evolution .",
    "although this work does not focus on the physical evolution of a spherical plasma liner imploding on vacuum , which was described in detail in awe _",
    "et al._,@xcite we provide here a brief summary of its 1d evolution : ( 1 )  the imploding liner converges toward the origin , and the liner density rises as @xmath18 , ( 2 )  upon the liner reaching the origin , an outward going shock propagates radially outward , shock - heating the incoming liner material , and ( 3 )  the outgoing shock reaches the outer edge of the incoming liner , at which time the high pressure of the post - shocked liner material can no longer be sustained , and the entire system disassembles .",
    "this work used the helios - cr@xcite 1d radiation - hydrodynamic code with lte and non - lte eos tables generated using the propaceos@xcite code .",
    "helios - cr  is a lagrangian code that can use both a polytropic eos ( with adiabatic constant @xmath19 ) or a tabular eos .",
    "the helios - cr  code has been applied previously to the modeling of inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) implosions.@xcite propaceos  eos and frequency - dependent opacities are computed using a combination of an isolated atom model and , at high densities at which cohesive effects are important , a quotidian - eos - like model.@xcite at the densities of interest in this paper , energies and pressures are computed for an isolated atom model in which atomic level populations are computed using boltzmann statistics and the saha equation ( lte case ) or a collisional - radiative model ( non - lte case ) .",
    "the energies and pressures of the eos tables are based on the free energy , thus providing for thermodynamically consistent energy and pressure values . for the non - lte case ,",
    "the effects of photoionization and photoexcitation are ignored when computing the temperature- and density- dependent tabular eos data , as the radiation field is a non - local quantity , _",
    "i.e. _ , the radiation can originate in other parts of the plasma , and therefore is unknown when generating the tables .",
    "detailed atomic models are utilized in which all ionization stages are included , _",
    "e.g. _ , for ar , a total of @xmath20 energy levels are included .",
    "more than @xmath21 transitions were used for the opacity calculations .",
    "frequency - dependent radiation transport is treated using a radiation diffusion model ; fifty frequency groups were used in this work . when modeling a plasma that is not optically thick ( our case ) with radiation diffusion , it is possible that radiation losses could be overestimated . finally , we checked energy conservation at @xmath22  @xmath0s ( near peak compression ) for the polytropic , lte tabular , and non - lte tabular cases , using run  6 of table  [ eos - table ] as an example .",
    "energy is conserved to within 0.1% , 0.1% , and 1.1% for the polytropic , lte , and non - lte runs , respectively .",
    "these are very small effects compared to the differences we report in this paper , and thus we conclude that energy conservation does not impact our results .",
    "we previously verified@xcite a helios - cr  calculation against the convergent shock noh problem@xcite and got better than 5% agreement for the highest resolution case we ran ( 50  @xmath0 m zone resolution over a sphere with 25  cm initial radius ) .",
    "we also did a grid resolution convergence study showing that an average grid resolution of 250  @xmath0 m gave @xmath23% accuracy.@xcite in this work , we used 400 computational zones over the initially 255  mm thick liner ( average of 637.5  @xmath0m / zone ) , which was chosen based on achieving a balance between getting reasonable agreement in the benchmarking studies described in sec .",
    "[ benchmarking ] and the run time of each simulation ( typically a few hours to a day per run ) .",
    "we used the automatic zoning feature of helios - cr , and thus the zone size was much smaller than the average near boundaries and much larger elsewhere .",
    "when using a polytropic eos , helios - cr  only allows use of a one - temperature ( 1 t ) model .",
    "the tabular eos simulations allow for separate ion @xmath24 and electron @xmath25 temperatures .",
    "all reported helios - crresults with polytropic eos are 1 t , and all reported results with tabular eos are 2 t with radiation diffusion . to verify that the use of 1 t versus 2 t does not have a great impact on our results , we compared the time evolution of @xmath25 and @xmath24 for the zone initially at @xmath26  cm and saw no difference .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath24 evolution from a 1 t run was virtually the same as that from the 2 t run .      because awe _",
    "et al._@xcite used the 1d lagrangian radiation - hydrodynamics code raven,@xcite we first benchmarked helios - cr  against raven  by performing runs 18 of table  [ eos - table ] using a polytropic eos and comparing with the raven  results . in this paper ,",
    "all polytropic eos runs used @xmath27 .",
    "we also included thermal tranport and radiation diffusion to be as consistent as possible with awe _",
    "et al._,@xcite which found that in these spherically convergent simulations , non - physical temperature and pressure spikes occur near the origin due to compression of the leading edge material of the liner . including thermal and radiation transport in the simulations helps prevent these non - physical spikes , which prevent the imploding plasma liner from reaching as small a radius as it otherwise would , leading to a much - reduced peak pressure.@xcite    we compared the quantities @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath1 is defined as the thermal pressure in the simulation zone that is initially 1.0  mm from the inner edge of the liner ( @xmath28  cm ) averaged over a time duration @xmath2 , which is defined ( and also shown graphically in fig .",
    "[ helios - raven - comparison]a ) as the time duration between maximum pressure to the time when pressure sustainment ends due to the outward going shock reaching the outer edge of the incoming liner .",
    "we found that raven  @xmath1 results ( table  [ raven - table ] ) are 1.23.5 times higher than the helios - cr  results ( table  [ polytropic - table ] ) .",
    "the @xmath2 results agree to within 20% .",
    "these differences were considered to be small enough to proceed with this study .",
    "we also compared helios - cr  and raven  simulation results for the time evolution ( fig .",
    "[ helios - raven - comparison]a ) of the pressure @xmath29 , mass density @xmath30 , and ion temperature @xmath24 of a single computational zone ( initially 1.0  cm from the inner edge of the liner , to be consistent with fig .  4 of awe _",
    "et al._@xcite ) , and the radial profiles ( fig .  [ helios - raven - comparison]b ) of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and electron temperature @xmath25 at a single time ( @xmath31  @xmath0s ) , for run 6 of table  [ eos - table ] .",
    "both comparisons indicate good qualitative agreement with some discrepancies .",
    "one difference is the increase in both @xmath29 and @xmath24 near the end of _",
    "@xmath2 _ for the helios - cr  but not the ravenresults .",
    "the magnitude of the rise in @xmath29 increases with increasing @xmath7 and is present throughout the entire stagnated liner , and is thus not a localized numerical effect in a single zone .",
    "the reason for this rise is not yet understood , but because this does not affect the conclusions of this paper , we have set the issue aside .",
    "there are also differences in the radial profiles at @xmath31  @xmath0s , largely due to the slight difference in time evolution between the two simulations . at this time",
    ", there is an outward going shock for both the helios - cr  ( at @xmath32  cm ) and raven   ( at @xmath33  cm ) simulations , but the helios - cr  shock has propagated farther outward . the discrepancy in @xmath25 inside the shock also appears to be due to the difference in time evolution , as slightly later radial profiles from the raven  results also fall toward the origin ( see fig .  4 of awe _ et al._@xcite ) .",
    "these differences do not affect the conclusions of this paper .",
    "the rest of the paper focuses on comparing helios - cr  simulations using a polytropic eos versus tabular eos data .",
    "this section presents helios - cr  simulation results and analysis .",
    "firstly , we discuss lte versus non - lte tabular eos results , showing that there are only minor differences , thus justifying our choice to focus on the use of lte for the subsequent results in the paper .",
    "secondly , we compare argon plasma liner implosions between polytropic and a lte tabular eos to assess the effects of ionization and a more sophisticated treatment of eos .",
    "finally , we explore the effects of using different plasma liner species for run  6 of table  [ eos - table ] , again using lte tabular eos data .",
    "the initial conditions we used ( see table  [ eos - table ] ) are in a parameter space in which lte is not obviously correct .",
    "non - lte can have an effect on eos ( _ i.e. _ , ionization / excitation ) and radiation losses ( excited states tend to be less populated ) .",
    "below an argon ion density of @xmath34  @xmath35 at @xmath36  ev , the fractions of ar  i , ar  ii , and ar  iii as a function of temperature are noticeably different between lte and non - lte calculations . above @xmath34",
    "@xmath35 , corresponding to later stages of liner implosion and stagnation , the eos data are similar .",
    "we performed run  6 of table  [ eos - table ] using both lte and non - lte tabular eos data to explicitly assess the difference in results .",
    "figure  [ lte - vs - nlte ] shows a comparison of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath24 versus time for the computational zone that is initially 1.0  cm from the inside edge of the plasma liner .",
    "note that for the tabular eos runs , the pressure is calculated as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the ion and electron densities , respectively , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the mean charge state .",
    "the lte and non - lte results are virtually indistinguishable over the entire duration of the simulation , and there are also no appreciable differences in @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath42 over the entire liner at several time steps ( not shown ) .",
    "this indicates that either lte or non - lte eos models could be used without altering the relevant simulation results for the purposes of this study , and thus we used lte for all subsequent results presented in the paper .      to assess the effects of ionization and other effects included in the lte tabular eos data , we compared helios - cr  simulation results using lte tabular eos with those using a polytropic ( @xmath43 ) eos for runs 18 of table  [ eos - table ] . for the computational zone that is initially 1.0  mm from the inside edge of the liner ,",
    "the maximum pressure @xmath44 is 3.66.1 times larger and @xmath1 3.98.6 times larger for the polytropic eos results .",
    "complete results for both the tabular lte and polytropic eos s are shown in tables  [ eos - table ] and [ polytropic - table ] , respectively .",
    "the @xmath24 and @xmath30 at peak compression were also higher in the polytropic eos results as well ( not shown ) .",
    "figure  [ eos - vs - polytropic ] shows @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath24 , and radial position versus time of the computational zone initially at 25.1  cm ( 1.0  cm from the inside edge of the liner ) for the initial conditions of run  6 of table  [ eos - table ] .",
    "the lower @xmath44 ( @xmath45 zone thermal energy divided by zone volume ) for the tabular eos result is consistent with the combined effects of lower zone thermal energy ( @xmath46 ) and higher zone volume at peak compression , as compared to the polytropic result .",
    "next , we investigate in more detail the reasons for the lower zone thermal energy and higher zone volume at peak compression for the tabular eos run .    figure  [ energy - vs - time - run-6 ] shows various components of the total liner energy versus time for run  6 of table  [ eos - table ] .",
    "the liner kinetic energy @xmath47 falls quickly around 5  @xmath0s when the leading edge of the liner reaches peak compression and stagnates . in the polytropic eos case ,",
    "the difference between the initial @xmath47 and the stagnated liner thermal energy @xmath48 is due mostly to radiative losses . in the tabular eos case , around half of the initial liner @xmath47 goes to ionization / excitation energy , which is stored in free and excited electrons in the stagnated liner",
    "the mean charge peaks around 7 ( see sec .",
    "[ species ] ) .",
    "the result of including the ionization / excitation physics is a drastic reduction in the liner compression at stagnation , leading to lower @xmath1 ( see tables  [ eos - table ] and [ polytropic - table ] ) .      awe _",
    "et al._@xcite found the approximate scalings @xmath49 and @xmath50 for the cases in table  [ eos - table ] using a polytropic eos model , and gave an heuristic argument for why @xmath51 ought to be an upper bound on the scaling dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath7 .",
    "the heuristic argument invoked the following assumptions : ( 1 )  perfect conversion of liner @xmath47 to liner @xmath48 at stagnation , ( 2 )  no radiation and thermal losses , and ( 3 )  no entropy production due to the outward going post - stagnation shock . because the raven  runs of awe _",
    "et al._@xcite included radiation and thermal losses , the observed weaker @xmath49 scaling is consistent with the heuristic upper bound of @xmath51 .",
    "our helios - cr  runs using a lte tabular eos violate assumption ( 1 ) above due to the major ionization / excitation energy channel discussed in sec .",
    "[ eos - vs - poly ] .",
    "thus , it is expected we should see an even weaker scaling than @xmath49 .",
    "figure  [ scalings ] shows @xmath1 versus @xmath11 and @xmath7 and fits to power law functions for helios - cr  simulations of the cases in table  i using a lte tabular eos model . while the fitted exponents are very similar across density and velocity groups in awe _",
    "et al._,@xcite _ i.e. _ , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , our fitted exponents have a much wider spread , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath54 and @xmath55",
    ". this larger spread in exponents is likely due to the fact that the lte tabular eos is sensitive to density and temperature in the imploding plasma liner , thus introducing a degree of variability that depends on the liner initial conditions not expected in the polytropic eos simulations of awe _ et al._@xcite our @xmath56 scaling ( depending on @xmath11 ) is indeed weaker than the approximate @xmath49 scaling of awe _",
    "et al._,@xcite as expected .",
    "our @xmath54 scaling agrees with the @xmath50 scaling of awe _",
    "et al._@xcite within our observed variation across velocity groups .      due to the significant effect of ionization / excitation on achievable @xmath1",
    ", we explored the use of different plasma species for the same initial liner @xmath13 and @xmath7 ( and hence @xmath47 ) of run  6 of table  [ eos - table ] .",
    "the only quantity that was varied was the initial number density @xmath11 to keep @xmath13 constant .",
    "we performed helios - cr  simulations with lte tabular eos data to investigate the effect of species on @xmath1 .",
    "the species chosen for study are those of interest as fusion fuel , blanket materials , or mif implosion drivers for fusion energy applications : h , d - t ( 50%-50% by atom ) , @xmath3he , @xmath4li , @xmath5b , ne , ar , kr , and xe .",
    "figure  [ species - vs - amu]a shows helios - cr  simulation results using a lte tabular eos model for @xmath29 , volume , @xmath48 , and ionization / excitation energy at peak compression versus atomic mass number for the zone initially 1.0  cm from the inner edge of the liner .",
    "there is a clear trend of increasing peak @xmath29 with atomic mass number , quantitatively consistent with the combined effects of decreasing volume and thermal pressure with atomic mass number at peak compression .",
    "the thermal and ionization / excitation energies are not monotonic with atomic mass number , and this is related to the different atomic and radiative properties of the different species .",
    "we also examined the mean charge and electron count versus time ( fig .",
    "[ species - vs - amu]b ) for the same computational zone as above . although the heavier species have more electrons to ionize , there are a larger number of the lighter species present by the ratio of their atomic mass numbers .",
    "it turns out that the peak mean charge for the heavier species reaches only about 510 ( fig .",
    "[ species - vs - amu]b ) , much less than the mass ratios between the heavier and lighter species , and thus the electron count is higher for the lighter species .",
    "thus , the ionization / excitation energies are in general higher for the lighter species , in part explaining why they reach lower peak pressures for the initial conditions imposed .",
    "it appears that the key effect of using a lte tabular eos rather than a polytropic eos is the significant diversion of liner @xmath47 into ionization / excitation , which is not included in the polytropic eos model .",
    "the diversion of initial liner @xmath47 leads to less effective compression , larger minimum volume at peak compression , and thus lower @xmath1 which is inversely proportional to volume .",
    "this is detrimental for reaching very high peak temperatures and pressures in targetless spherical plasma liner implosions , which was one of the design objectives of plx . for a given initial liner @xmath47 , which is a natural experimental constraint ,",
    "the results suggest the use of lower density and higher velocity to achieve higher peak pressure . the previous statement",
    "is confirmed by examining , _",
    "e.g. _ , the @xmath1 results from runs 3 , 6 , and 9 ( 375  kj ) , or runs 4 , 7 , 10 , and 13 ( 1.5  mj ) of table  [ eos - table ] .",
    "higher velocity should also be coupled with the use of lower atomic mass number species so as to fully strip the ions and eliminate the ionization / excitation and line radiation energy channels beyond a certain point in the implosion , after which the liner @xmath47 will predominantly go toward stagnation thermal pressure .",
    "this is in apparent contradiction with the results of sec .",
    "[ species ] , which suggest the use of heavier species for higher @xmath1 but only because we constrained the species comparison study by enforcing the same @xmath7 and @xmath13 . in our species comparison study",
    ", the much higher @xmath11 of the lighter species leads to more of the initial liner @xmath47 going into ionization / excitation .",
    "further study is needed for optimizing @xmath1 in targetless spherical plasma liner implosions for a given initial liner @xmath47 .",
    "the above discussion does not apply for the mif application of a plasma liner compressing a magnetized d - t target plasma.@xcite in that case , the imploding plasma liner is intended to be only a pusher that should complete its job of compressing the d - t target to fusion conditions before the liner itself has a chance to get significantly compressed and heated .",
    "thus , for initial liner @xmath11 and @xmath7 that are likely to be limited by available plasma gun technology , the mif application likely will prefer a heavy liner species ( to maximize @xmath57 ) since the ionization / excitation should not matter until after the d - t target has reached peak compression .    in summary , we have presented new 1d helios - cr   radiation - hydrodynamic simulation results of spherical plasma liners imploding on vacuum using a lte tabular eos model .",
    "the results were compared in detail to helios - cr  simulations using a polytropic eos model ( @xmath43 ) , which in turn were benchmarked against the polytropic eos simulation results of awe _",
    "et al._@xcite we found that the liner stagnation pressure @xmath1 is lower by a factor of 3.98.6 using the lte tabular eos model .",
    "this is attributed to a significant amount of the initial liner kinetic energy going toward ionization / excitation of the plasma liner , resulting in less effective compression of the liner .",
    "we also studied the effect of different species on @xmath1 for the same initial liner geometry , mass density , and velocity .",
    "we found that with these constraints , the heaviest species reach the highest values of @xmath1 .",
    "this is attributed to less total energy going to ionization / excitation due to a smaller value at peak compression of the liner mean charge times the initial number density .",
