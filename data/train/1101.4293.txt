    "many results of classical function theory ( cft ) are more natural when expressed in terms of the hyperbolic metric than the euclidean metric .",
    "naturality refers here to invariance with respect to conformal maps or specific subgroups of mbius transformations .",
    "for example , one of the corner stones of cft , the schwarz lemma @xcite , says that an analytic function of the unit disk into itself is a hyperbolic contraction , i.e. , decreases hyperbolic distances .",
    "another example is nevanlinna s principle of the hyperbolic metric @xcite .",
    "note that the hyperbolic metric is invariant under conformal maps .",
    "usual methods of cft such as power series , integral formulas , calculus of residues , are mainly concerned with the local behavior of functions and do not reflect invariance very well .",
    "the extremal length method of ahlfors and beurling @xcite has conformal invariance as a built - in feature and has become a powerful tool of cft during the past sixty years that have elapsed since its discovery .",
    "one may even say that conformal invariance , and thus `` naturality '' , is one of the guiding principles of geometric function theory .",
    "there are serious obstacles in generalizing these ideas from the two - dimensional case to euclidean spaces of dimension @xmath1 for instance , basic facts such as multiplication of complex numbers or power series of functions , do not make sense here .",
    "perhaps a more dramatic obstacle is the failure of riemann s mapping theorem for dimensions @xmath2 according to liouville s theorem , conformal maps of a domain @xmath3 onto @xmath4 are of the form @xmath5 for some mbius transformation @xmath6    here we shall study various ways to generalize the hyperbolic metric to the @xmath0-dimensional case @xmath1 in order to circumvent the above difficulties , we do not require complete invariance with respect to a group of transformations , but only require `` quasi - invariance '' under transformations called quasi - isometries .",
    "now there are numerous `` degrees of freedom '' , for instance some of the questions posed below make sense in general metric spaces equipped with some special properties .",
    "therefore the problems below allow for a great number of variations , depending on the particular metric or on the geometry of the space .",
    "the dictionary of distances @xcite lists hundreds of metrics .",
    "this survey is based on my lectures held in two workshops / conferences at iit - madras in december 2009 and august 2010 . in december 2005",
    "i gave a similar survey @xcite and this survey partially overlaps it .",
    "the main difference is that here mainly metric spaces are studied while in the previous survey also categories of maps between metric spaces such as bilipschitz maps or quasiconformal maps were considered . during the past decade",
    "the progress has been rapid in this area as shown by the several recent phd theses @xcite .",
    "in fact , some of the many problems formulated in @xcite have been solved in @xcite .",
    "the original informal lecture style has been mainly kept without major changes .",
    "as in @xcite , several problems of varying level of difficulty , from challenging exercises to research problems , are given .",
    "it was assumed that the audience was familiar with basic real and complex analysis .",

    "the notion of a metric space was introduced by m. frecht in his thesis in 1906 .",
