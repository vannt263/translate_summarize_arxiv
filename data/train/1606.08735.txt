    "the dirac semimetal ( dsm ) @xcite is a topologically non - trivial state which has attracted much attention recently .",
    "similar to the topologically protected surface states of the more well established three - dimensional topological insulators ( tis ) @xcite , the low energy dispersion relations of dsms take the form of dirac cones .",
    "differing from the 3d tis where there are odd numbers of dirac cones within the brillouin zone and the linear dispersion of the dirac fermion hamiltonian hold only in two dimensions for the surface states , the weyl nodes in the _ bulk _ states of dsms disperse linearly in three dimensions . and appear in pairs .",
    "one weyl node of each pair is a source of berry curvature while the other node is a berry curvature sink .",
    "fermi arcs linking the two members of each pair emerge when a bulk dsm is truncated and a surface introduced perpendicular to the @xmath1 space separation between the weyl nodes introduced .",
    "these weyl nodes are topologically stable against perturbations which preserve the translational symmetry . to date",
    ", two materials , @xcite and @xcite have been experimentally confirmed to host the dsm state .",
    "most of the existing studies on tunneling in dsms and the closely related weyl semimetals wsms have focused on infinitely sized bulk dsm / wsm slabs in the the @xmath1 space vicinity around a single weyl node @xcite .",
    "this neglects the effect of inter - valley tunneling between multiple weyl nodes .",
    "the influence of fermi arc states on the tunneling process is also not evident in these models as the explicit appearance of fermi arcs requires pairs of weyl nodes separated in @xmath1-space to be considered , as well as the presence of surfaces perpendicular to the @xmath1 space separation between the arcs .    in order to elucidate how multiple weyl nodes and fermi arc state on the tunneling spectrum compared with single weyl node models of dsm / wsm tunneling",
    ", we study in this work the tunneling through thin films of the dsm @xcite in an experimental setup similar to that in the earlier works , most of which have focused on klein tunneling .",
    "we study the transmission from a semi - infinitely long source dsm thin film segment to a semi - infinite drain dsm thin film segment through a central segment subjected to a potential .",
    "we mode the using the hamiltonian of refs .",

    "@xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are material parameters for which we used the values in ref .",
    "the hamiltonian consists of two uncoupled blocks representing the spin up and spin down states .",
    "since the spin up and spin down states are uncoupled we can study each of these spin states separately . here",
    "we focus on the spin up states .",
    "( the corresponding results for the spin down states can be obtained from those for the spin up states by replacing @xmath11 . )",
    "this hamiltonian yields , for each spin and an infinite - sized homogeneous crystal , two weyl nodes located at @xmath12 an at @xmath13 . in the infinite crystal",
    "the dispersion in the vicinity of each weyl node is linear , reminiscent of a dirac cone and can be identified with a ` valley ' .    the introduction of the thin film geometry with infinite dimensions along the @xmath14 and @xmath15 directions and finite thickness @xmath16 along the @xmath17 direction lead to the formation of energy subbands ( fig .",
    "[ gw50paper1]a ) due to the quantum confinement along the @xmath17 direction .",
    "( the eigenspectrum was obtained by expanding the schroedinger equation @xmath18 in the basis of the @xmath19 infinite potential well eigenstates and numerically diagonalizing the resulting matrix . )",
    "the subbands , except for the specific bands indicated in black in panel ( a ) of the figure , are bulk subbands in the sense that there is significant particle density in the interior of the thin film away from the top and bottom surfaces .",
    "the cross sections of these bulk states on the @xmath20 dispersion graphs of panel ( a ) correspond to the elliptical cross sections of the dirac cones at small @xmath21 distributed symmetrically about @xmath2 in panel ( b ) .",
    "the subbands leads to the opening up of a bulk energy gap between the top of the hole bulk bands and the bottom of the particle bulk bands .",
    "the presence of the top and bottom surfaces at @xmath22 results in the appearance of fermi arc states @xcite , indicated in black in panel ( a ) of the figure , as well as in panel ( b ) .",
    "these fermi arc states differ from the bulk bands in that they are localized near the top or bottom surface of the thin film  for a given spin the arcs convex in the @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) direction are localized near the top ( bottom ) surface , and exist even inside the bulk energy gap .     for a @xmath25 thick thin film .",

    "we note a few features in the eecs of fig .",

    "the figure corresponds to a thin film of thickness @xmath25",
    ". this will be the thickness of the thin films we study in the remainder of this paper .",
    "the finite thickness of the film leads to the opening of a bulk energy gap between @xmath27 to @xmath28 crossed only by the fermi arc states . for the particular model hamiltonian and parameter set",
    "of which we are employing , the elliptical cross sections of the dirac cones at the two valleys shift inwards towards smaller values of @xmath29 as the energy increases . in order to connect with earlier single weyl node studies of tunneling in wsm / dsm materials we consider the energy and gate potential ranges when there is only ta single propagating bulk band per valley and / or the fermi arc state in the source and drain leads , and the central segment , and consider transmission from only the @xmath30ve @xmath26 valley bulk states .",
    "( these states are highlighted in the black ring in the inset of panel ( b ) of fig .",

    "we set the lead energy at @xmath31 as this gives a relatively wide range of gate potential in the central segment where only a single bulk band and / or the fermi arc states are propagating .",
    "we consider cases where the interfaces between the central segment and the source / drain leads are parallel , as well as perpendicular to the @xmath1 space separation between the weyl nodes .",
    "we shall see that the presence of the two valleys as well as the fermi arc states lead to the emergence of features missed in the earlier studies .",
    "we first study the transmission from the positive @xmath26 valley hole - like states at @xmath32 source segment , through the central segment to the drain segment when the interfaces between the source and central segment , and between the central segment and the drain , are parallel to the @xmath14 axis .",
    "the system is hence translationally invariant along the @xmath14 direction and @xmath33 is conserved .",
    "the gate applies a potential which shifts the effective energy of the central segment @xmath34 with respect to that of the source and drain leads .",

    "the vertical yellow dotted line in panel ( b ) indicates the energy of the source and drain segments . ]    for @xmath37 , the transmission is relatively high with a moderate amount of transmission oscillation for @xmath38 . as @xmath35 increases between @xmath31 to @xmath27 the @xmath36 angular region where there is relatively high transmission tapers down to a point .",
    "this range of @xmath35 corresponds to the transmission from the hole states in the source to the hole states in the central segment .",
    "the transmission is almost ( but not exactly ) 0 for all values of @xmath36 for @xmath35 ranging from @xmath27 to @xmath39 . between @xmath39",
    "to @xmath40 there are two small angular ranges on either side of @xmath41 where there is small but significant transmission .",
    "finally as @xmath35 increases above @xmath42 the transmission becomes large again , with the @xmath36 angular range over which the transmission is large increasing with @xmath35 until it spans the range from @xmath38 .",
    "the transmission for @xmath43 corresponds to that from the hole states in the source to the particle states in the central segment .",
    "the transmission oscillations for @xmath43 are more prominent and occur with a shorter @xmath35 periodicity compared to the fringes at @xmath44 .",
    "these transmission oscillations in turn have a shorter @xmath35 periodicity for the longer segment compared to the shorter one .",
    "these features may be explained by @xmath33 conservation and the eec profiles in the leads ( i.e. the source and drain ) , and the central segments as shown in fig .",
    "[ gw50tuny ] .",
    "( a ) . panels ( b ) to ( d ) profile show the source ( thick black lines ) and central segment ( thinner green lines ) eecs at the indicated values of @xmath35 in panel ( a ) .",

    "the thicker sections of the source eecs correspond to the source states which progagate in the @xmath46 direction . ]",
    "@xmath33 conservation restricts the angular range over which there is finite transmission to the range of @xmath36 in which there are propagating states for the values of source @xmath33 which @xmath36 corresponds to . in general , the transmission probability from a bulk source state to a central segment fermi arc state , while finite , is relatively very low compared to the transmission probability to a central segment bulk state .",
    "this is largely due to the lack of spatial overlap between wavefunctions of the fermi arc states , which are localized either surface of the film , and the bulk states where significant probability density is found within the interior of the film . for @xmath47 , the elliptical cross sections of the bulk ` dirac cones ' span a larger @xmath33 range than the @xmath33 range spanned by the bulk source eec .",
    "the angular range of @xmath36 with high transmission is thus limited by the @xmath33 range spanned by the source eec and the transmission is relatively high over the entire range of @xmath38 over which the source states propagate in the @xmath46 direction",
    ". between @xmath48 the @xmath33 range spanned by the elliptical cross sections of the central segment dirac hole cones shrinks with increasing @xmath35 to 0 at the bottom of the bulk energy gap .",
    "this leads to the narrowing of the range of @xmath36 with relatively high transmission to zero .",
    "we note from panel ( b ) that for @xmath49 there is a small probability for a source state from the positive @xmath26 valley to be transmitted to a central segment state at the negative @xmath26 valley .",
    "( this probability is still significantly higher than that for transmission to a fermi arc state . )",
    "this inter - valley transmission contributes to the oscillation of the transmission at fixed @xmath50 as the energy varies .",
    "the @xmath35 range between @xmath27 to @xmath42 corresponds to the bulk gap in the central segment where the only propagating states are the fermi arc states .",
    "the transmission of the bulk source states to the the central fermi arc states give a small but finite transmission over this @xmath35 range that becomes especially prominent from @xmath39 to @xmath42 .    as @xmath35 increases beyond @xmath42 the @xmath36 range with high transmission increase with energy as the @xmath33 range spanned by the central segment eecs increases to 0 to beyond the @xmath33 range spanned by the source states .",
    "compared to the @xmath44 energy range , there is an increased probability of the positive @xmath26 source states being transmitted to the other valley with negative @xmath26 .",
    "this may be due to the closer pseudospin alignment between the hole states in the positive @xmath26 valley on the source side , and the particle states in the negative @xmath26 valley on the central segment side , than the pseudospin alignment between the hole states in different valleys when @xmath44 .",
    "this increased inter - valley transmission results in more prominent oscillations of the transmission at a fixed @xmath36 as the energy is varied beyond @xmath51 compared to the oscillations at @xmath44 .    the inter - valley scattering and the fermi arcs are absent in single weyl node models .",
    "the enhanced fabry - perot transmission oscillations , as well as the small angular ranges with small finite transmission occurring at energy ranges falling within the central segment bulk gap due to inter - valley scattering and fermi arc states respectively will hence not be captured in these models .    as a comparative example",
    ", we now turn our attention to the transmission from the source to the drain segment through a central segment subjected to a gate potential when the central segment - lead interfaces are now along the @xmath14 direction . in this case",
    ", @xmath26 is conserved .",
    "the transmission profile is somewhat more difficult compare directly against single weyl - model models as the centers of the elliptical cross sections of the ` dirac cones ' here shift inwards towards smaller @xmath29 values with increasing energy ( fig.[gw50paper1 ] ) .",
    "this inwards shift leads to distinct features in the transmission profile , shown in fig .",
    "[ gca1comb ] .",
    "( note that @xmath52 is defined differently from @xmath36 in the earlier figures in order for @xmath53 to correspond to normal incidence of the source wavefunctions on the source - central segment interfaces . )    , and the central segment energy @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath52 is defined in the inset of the panel where the states propagating in the @xmath54 direction are indicated on the thicker line .",

    "the thickness of the arrows pointing from the source to the central segment eecs in ( b ) and ( c ) show the relative probability of transmission form the source states to the central segment states at the value of @xmath26 indicated by the dotted lines . ]    unlike the case where the lead - central segment interfaces are parallel to the @xmath14 direction , the transmission for interfaces parallel to the @xmath15 direction are not symmetrical about @xmath53 .",
    "this asymmetry is due to the @xmath26 shift of the center of the elliptical dirac cone cross sections towards @xmath55 with increasing energy .",
    "this shift results in the central segment state with the same pseudospin direction as the source state at a given value of @xmath26 being the central segment state with a slightly displaced value of @xmath26 .",
    "another major difference is that there is 0 transmission to the other valley here since the @xmath26 ranges of the two valleys do not overlap .",
    "the lack of inter - valley transmission results in less prominent transmission oscillations with energy variation compared .",
    "similar to the interface along @xmath15 case studied earlier , the transmission is relatively high for @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "the angular range of @xmath52 with high transmission drops to 0 as @xmath35 is increased beyond @xmath31 .",
    "this drop can be attributed to the combined effects of the shrinkage and displacement of the central eec segment with increasing energy , both of which reduce the range of @xmath26 overlap between the source and central segment eecs . between @xmath58 the transmission is zero as there are no propagating central segment states within the @xmath26 range spanned by the source eec . as @xmath35 increases beyond @xmath39 the central segment fermi arc starts to move into the @xmath26 span of the source eec , giving finite transmission again .",
    "the relatively large @xmath33 difference between the central segment fermi arc state and source bulk state at a given value of @xmath26 results in more pronounced transmission oscillations with energy variation .",
    "component of the em vector potential which is proportional to the @xmath26 shift . ]    the influence of the overlap between the momentum ranges perpendicular to the interface spanned by the lead and central segment eecs on the transmission profile suggests that the transmission profile can be manipulated by changing the overlap range .",
    "one way of achieving this is to introduce a shift of the eec profile in momentum space by introducing antisymmetrically magnetized ferromagnetic ( fm ) strips to the interfaces between the leads and the central segment as shown in fig .",
    "[ gfmstrip ] .",
    "the fm strips produce localized magnetic fields which we model as dirac delta functions .",
    "the vector potential in the central segment between the strips then takes the form of a step function .",
    "the effects of the magnetic field can be incorporated via the replacement of @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the electromagnetic vector potential .",
    "we choose the gauge such that the electromagnetic vector potential only has components along the @xmath1 direction we want to displace .",
    "the fm strips hence lead to a translation of the eec of the central segments in @xmath1 space perpendicular to the direction of the fm magnetization .",
    "[ gca15comb ] shows the transmission from such a setup with fixed @xmath61 and length @xmath62 as a function of the fm strip induced @xmath33 shift @xmath63 and angular coordinate @xmath52 around the source eec .    , and the central segment @xmath26 shift @xmath64 at @xmath61 .",

    "the thickness of the arrows pointing from the source to the central segment eecs in ( b ) to ( d ) show the relative probability of transmission form the source states to the central segment states at the value of @xmath26 indicated by the dotted lines . ]",
    "the transmission is zero for large positive values of @xmath64 when the largest value of @xmath26 for the drain propagating states at @xmath45 on the bulk fermi arcs are pushed beyond the smallest value of @xmath26 on the source eec , resulting in 0 overlap between the source and drain eecs .",
    "the transmission profile for smaller , and negative values of @xmath64 in the figure can be divided into three regime ",
    "a narrow band of @xmath64 range where the transmission is near unity and oscillates weakly , an even narrower band of 0 transmission as @xmath26 decreases further , and a broad band of @xmath26 range where the transmission shows great oscillation with @xmath64 .    the narrow band of @xmath64 with near unity transmission corresponds to the @xmath26 range where @xmath26 values of the source and drain bulk eecs overlap .",
    "( they overlap partially in panels ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ gca15comb ] .",
    "the transmission is then contributed largely by the transmission from source to central segment bulk states , which occurs at a higher probability than the transmission from source bulk states to central segment fermi arc states . within this energy band the transmission peaks for a given @xmath36 when @xmath64 compensates exactly for the @xmath35 shift in the central segment dirac cone cross sectional ellipse so that the pseudospin orientation between the source and central segment eecs at a given value of @xmath26 are aligned .    as @xmath64 decreases we encounter the situation ( panel ( c ) and ( d ) ) where a narrow @xmath36 range on the source eec falls into the @xmath26 range falling in between the source bulk and fermi arc states .",
    "there is 0 transmission in this @xmath36 range since there are no propagating central segment states at the corresponding values of @xmath26 .",
    "a further decrease in @xmath64 leads to more , and eventually , all of the @xmath26 range spanned by the source eec spanned into that spanned by the central segment fermi arc eecs .",
    "the relatively large @xmath33 vector differences between the source and central segment states propagating in the @xmath46 direction leads to the more pronounced transmission oscillations .",
    "in this work we studied the transmission of the hole states of the positive @xmath26 valley in thin film from a source lead through a central segment with a gate potential to an identical drain lead . the finite thickness of the thin film results in the appearance of fermi arc states as well as energy subbands in the dispersion relation .",
    "we considered the two cases where the interfaces between the leads and the central segment are ( i ) perpendicular and ( ii ) parallel to the @xmath1 space separation in the @xmath26 direction between the weyl nodes .",
    "we saw that in the first case , inter - valley scattering gives rise to pronounced transmission oscillations with the variation of the central segment length and gate potential while the fermi arc results in finite transmission even when the energy falls within the central segment bulk energy gap .",
    "both of these features are not captured by earlier studies based on models which consider only a single weyl node .",
    "we also saw that for interfaces parallel to the @xmath15 direction , the fermi arc states result in a finite transmission even when there is zero transverse momentum overlap between the source and central segment _ bulk _ states .",
    "this transmission can be modulated by the introduction of thin ferromagnetic strips at the central segment - lead interfaces where the electromagnetic vector potential leads to a translation of the central segment equal energy contours in @xmath1 space .",
