    "with the discovery of non - zero @xmath1 by the reactor and accelerator neutrino experiments  @xcite the focus has been shifted to the determination of neutrino mass hierarchy and the measurement of the leptonic cp violation phase , which may hold the key to the matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe . to correctly interpret the oscillation data one needs to understand the neutrino - nucleon ( nucleus ) interaction thoroughly .",
    "the low momentum ( @xmath2 ) transfer , high energy ( @xmath3 ) transfer interactions of neutrino induced coherent @xmath0 meson production allows us to study the basic properties of the weak current : the conservation of the vector current hypothesis ( cvc )  @xcite .",
    "based on the vector - dominance model  @xcite , the differential cross section can be derived as  @xcite : @xmath4 ^ 2       ( 1 + \\epsilon r ) \\left [ \\frac{d \\sigma^t ( \\rho^+ { \\cal a } \\rightarrow \\rho^+ { \\cal a})}{dt } \\right ] ,      \\label{eq - cohrhop2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 is the weak coupling constant , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is related to the @xmath0 form - factor , the polarization parameter @xmath12 , and @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 as the longitudinal and transverse @xmath0-nucleus cross sections .",
    "the @xmath0 form factor , @xmath11 , is related to the corresponding factor in charged - lepton scattering , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the cabibbo angle and @xmath18 is the coupling of @xmath19 to photon ( @xmath20 ) .    following the rein - sehgal model of meson - nucleus absorption  @xcite , @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the `` hadron - nucleon '' cross - section with the energy of the hadron @xmath23 , @xmath24 such that @xmath25 , with @xmath26 and the absorption factor @xmath27 .",
    "the nomad experiment is a short baseline neutrino experiment designed to search for @xmath28 oscillations using the cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) wideband neutrino beam  @xcite .",
    "the 450 gev protons from the sps impinge on a beryllium target producing secondary mesons ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) which will produce neutrinos .",
    "the neutrino events dominated by @xmath32 ( @xmath33=@xmath34 ) have a mean energy of @xmath3524 gev spanning the region of @xmath36 gev .",
    "the nomad detector consists of several sub - detectors .",
    "132 planes of @xmath37  m@xmath38 drift chambers ( dc ) with an average density similar to that of liquid hydrogen ( 0.1  g/@xmath39 ) serve as the active target .",
    "the fiducial mass of the dc is 2.7 tons with an effective atomic number , @xmath40 , similar to carbon .",
    "the dc provides excellent momentum resolution , @xmath41 .",
    "the dc is followed by nine modules of transition radiation detectors ( trd ) , a pre - shower ( prs ) and a lead - glass electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) .",
    "the trd , prs , and ecal sub - detectors provide a high - resolution efficiency and purity ( @xmath42% ) of electron detection .",
    "a dipole magnet provides a 0.4 t magnetic field orthogonal to the neutrino beam direction that surrounds the dc , trd , and prs / ecal .",
    "the magnet is followed by hadron calorimeter ( hcal ) and two muon - stations comprising large area drift chambers separated by an iron filter placed at 8- and 13-@xmath43 s downstream of the ecal , and the muon - stations provide a clean identification of the muons .",
    "the data used in this analysis were collected from 1995 to 1998 with @xmath44 protons on target in neutrino mode , which corresponds to @xmath45 @xmath32-cc interactions in the drift chamber .",
    "the monte carlo simulation of the coherent diffractive @xmath0 process was done based on the diffraction model  @xcite .",
    "the details of data and mc have been described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath46 followed by @xmath47 has two tracks ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) originating from the reconstructed primary vertex .",
    "the @xmath50 promptly decays into two photons .",
    "the two photons either both convert in the drift chamber ( 2 @xmath51s event ) , or one of the photons converts in the drift chamber and the other is measured in the electromagnetic calorimeter ( 1 @xmath51 1 cluster event ) , or both photons are measured in the ecal ( 2 cluster event ) .    the two - track monte carlo events with an identified muon within the fiducial volume that pass the following preselection cuts are used to build a likelihood ratio to separate the signal from background .",
    "these preselection cuts are 1 ) the opening angle between @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( @xmath52 ) is less than 0.5 rad , 2 ) the @xmath49 energy ( @xmath53 ) is greater than 1 gev , 3 ) the missing transverse momentum ( @xmath54 ) is less than 0.5 gev , and 4 ) the event should have either 2 @xmath51s , 1 @xmath51 plus 1 cluster , or 2 clusters .",

    "shows the numbers ( background , raw data , efficiency and fully corrected coh@xmath61 signal events ) in the signal region obtained from both likelihood and nn analysis .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty is @xmath623.9% which comes from 1 ) @xmath621.6% background normalization error dominated by charged - current deep inelastic events which is obtained by using the control region in likelihood or nn , 2 ) @xmath622.5% absolute normalization error which is from the inclusive charged current cross section measurement  @xcite , and 3 ) @xmath622.5% signal efficiency related error which is found by varying the likelihood or nn cut , difference between likelihood and nn , and mock data study .",
    "using the measured inclusive @xmath32-cc cross - section from  @xcite as a function of @xmath63 , the absolute cross - section of coh@xmath61 production for a = 12.8 at the average energy of the neutrino flux @xmath64 gev is determined to be : @xmath65\\times10^{-40 } \\,\\rm cm^2/nucleus,\\ ] ] which is consistent with the prediction and previous measurements but with much better precision .",

    "the precision determination of relative and absolute neutrino flux is essential to any neutrino oscillation and cross section measurements , especially in the precision era .",
