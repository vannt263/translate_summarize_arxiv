    "we follow the choice of ref .",
    "of using revpbe@xcite exchange . among the functionals that we have easy access to , the revpbe has proved to be the best candidate for minimizing the tendency of artificial exchange binding in graphite.@xcite    using the scheme described above to evaluate @xmath35 , the total energy finally reads : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the gga total energy with the revpbe choice for the exchange description and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) the gga ( lda ) correlation energy . as our gga calculations in this specific application of vdw - df",
    "are carried out in pbe , not revpbe , we further need to explicitly replace the pbe exchange in @xmath37 by that of revpbe for the same electron charge density distribution .",

    "but here we find that the surface dipoles cause a slower convergence with layer separation .",
    "we use a system with the layer separation between the potassium layer and the nearest graphite layer(s ) @xmath40  ( 8  ) as reference for the adsorption ( absorption ) study .",
    "the evaluation of the nonlocal correlations @xmath21 requires additional care .",
    "this is due to technical reasons pertaining to numerically stability in basing the @xmath21 evaluation on the fft grid used to converge the underlying traditional - dft calculations .",
    "the evaluation of the nonlocal correlation energy , eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonlocal2 ] ) , involves a weighted double integral of a kernel with a significant short - range variation @xcite .",
    "the shape of the kernel makes the @xmath21 evaluation sensitive to the particulars of fft - type griding,@xcite for example , to the relative position of fft grid points relative to the nuclei position ( for a finite grid - point spacing ) .",
    "however , robust evaluation of binding- or cohesive - energy contributions by nonlocal correlations can generally be secured by a further splitting of energy differences into steps that minimize the above - mentioned grid sensitivity .",
    "the problem of fft sensitivity of the @xmath21 evaluation is accentuated because the binding in the @xmath21 channel arises as a smaller energy difference between sizable @xmath21 contributions of the system and of the fragments .",
    "conversely , convergence in vdw - df calculations of binding and cohesive energies can be obtained even at a moderate fft grid accuracy ( 0.13  used here ) by devising a calculational scheme that always maintains identical position of the nuclei relative to grid points in the combined systems as well as in the fragment reference system .",
    "thus we obtain a numerically robust evaluation of the @xmath35 energy differences by choosing steps for which we can explicitly control the fft griding . for adsorption and absorption cases",
    "we calculate the reference systems as a sum of @xmath35-contributions for each fragment and we make sure to always position the fragment at the exact same position in the system as in the interacting system . for bulk systems we choose steps in which we exclusively adjust the inter - plane or in - plane lattice constant . here",
    "the reference system is then simply defined as a system with either double ( or in some cases quadruple ) lattice constant and with a corresponding doubling of the fft griding along the relevant unit - cell vector .",
    "the cost of full convergence is that , in practice , we often do three or more gga calculations and subsequent @xmath35 calculations for each point on the absorption , absorption , or formation - energy curve .",
    "in addition to the calculations for the full system we have to do one for each of the isolated fragments at identical position in the adsorption / absorption cases and one or more for fragments in the doubled unit - cell and doubled griding reference . we have explicitly tested that using a fft grid spacing of @xmath41  ( but not larger ) for such reference calculations is sufficient to ensure full convergence in the reported @xmath35 ( and @xmath42 total ) energy variation for graphitic systems .",
    "the cohesive energy of graphite ( g ) is the energy gain , per carbon atom , of creating graphite at in - plane lattice constant @xmath5 and layer separation @xmath6 from isolated ( spin - polarized ) carbon atoms .",
    "@xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are total energies per carbon atom .",

    "( [ eq : vdw ] ) ] for the system at hand minus the total energy of the initial system , i.e. , a clean graphite surface and isolated gas - phase potassium atoms",
    ". however , due to the above mentioned technical issues in using the vdw - df we calculate the adsorption and absorption energy as a sum of ( artificial ) stages leading to the desired system : first the initially isolated , spin - polarized potassium atoms are gathered into a free floating potassium layer with the structure corresponding to a full cover of potassium atoms . by this",
    "the total system gains the energy @xmath48 , with @xmath49    in _ adsorption _ the potassium layer is then simply placed on top of the four - layer @xmath50 graphite surface ( with the k atoms above graphite hollows ) at distance @xmath51 .",

    "it is likely that systematic investigations of the exchange effects can further refine the accuracy of vdw - df implementations.@xcite in any case , vdw - df theory calculations represent , in contrast to pbe , the only approach to obtain a full ab initio characterization of the am intercalation process .",
    "the c@xmath1k system is more compact than graphite and this explains why pbe alone can here provide a good description of the materials structure and at least some materials properties , whereas it fails completely for graphite .",
    "the distance between the graphene sheets upon intercalation of potassium atoms is stretched compared to that of pure graphite , but the to ( graphite-)layer separation , @xmath122 , is significantly less than the layer - layer separation in pure graphite .",
    "this indicates that c@xmath1k is likely held together , at least in part , by shorter - ranged interactions .",
    "table [ table_formation ] documents that the vdw binding nevertheless plays an important role in the binding and formation of c@xmath1k .",

    "it is also interesting to note that the combination of shorter - ranged and vdw bonding components in c@xmath1k yields a layer binding energy that is close to that of the graphite case . in spite of the difference in nature of interactions , we find almost identical binding energies per layer for the case of the exfoliation and accordion in graphite and for the accordion in c@xmath1k",
    ". this observation testifies to a perhaps surprising strength of the so - called soft - matter vdw interactions .    in a wider perspective",
    "our vdw - df permits a first comparison of the range of am - graphite systems from adsorption over absorption to full intercalation and thus insight on the intercalation progress .",
    "assuming a dense @xmath85 configuration , we find that the energy for potassium adsorption and absorption is nearly degenerate with an indication that absorption is slightly preferred , consistent with experimental behavior .",
    "we also find that the potassium absorption may eventually proceeds towards full intercalation thanks to a significant release of formation energy .",
    "the potassium intercalation process in graphite has been investigated by means of the vdw - df density functional method .",
    "this method includes the dispersive interactions needed for a consistent investigation of the intercalation process . for clean graphite the vdw - df predicts  contrary to standard semilocal dft implementations  a stabilized bulk system with equilibrium crystal parameters in close agreement with experiments . two limits of the absorption process have been investigated by the vdw - df , namely single layer subsurface absorption and the fully potassium intercalated stage-1 crystal c@xmath1k . here the vdw - df is shown to enhance the ( semi-)local type of bonding described by traditional approaches .",
