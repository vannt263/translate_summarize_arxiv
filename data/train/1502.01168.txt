    "inherently , nanostructured materials possess small volumes that limit their interaction with optical fields .",
    "fortunately , this can be compensated by high oscillator strengths provided by either quantum confinement effects @xcite or the intense near - fields generated by localized surface plasmons @xcite . in particular , the near - field enhancement associated with plasmons in noble metal nanostructures has been widely used with the purpose of enhancing the nonlinear response of surrounding dielectric materials @xcite .",

    "a metallic nanocomposite can be engineered to possess multiple resonance frequencies , enabling the optimization of nonlinear wave mixing between multifrequency optical fields @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , plasmons are hardly tunable in metals after a structure has been fabricated @xcite , thus severely limiting the choice of frequency combinations .    as an alternative plasmonic material",
    ", electrically doped graphene has been found to support long - lived plasmonic excitations that efficiently couple to light and are actively tunable by changing the density of charge carriers @xcite .",
    "strong intrinsic nonlinearities have also been observed in this material @xcite , which could be further enhanced by plasmons @xcite .",
    "recently , plasmon - assisted second - harmonic generation ( shg ) and down conversion with good efficiencies at the few - photon level have been shown to be possible when the fundamental and the second - harmonic are simultaneously resonant with plasmons in a graphene nanoisland @xcite .",
    "we have predicted that a similar mechanism can lead to unprecedentedly intense shg and third - harmonic generation ( thg ) in nanographene @xcite .",
    "although experimental studies have so far demonstrated strong plasmons at mid - infrared and terahertz frequencies @xcite , further reduction in the size of the islands down to less than 10 nm should allow us to reach the visible and near - infrared ( vis - nir ) regimes @xcite .",
    "in particular , commercially - available polycyclic aromatic molecules sustain plasmon - like resonances that are switched on and off by changing their charge state @xcite .",
    "additionally , recent progress in the chemical synthesis of nanographene @xcite provides further stimulus for the use of this material to produce electrically tunable vis - nir plasmons , as well as their application to nonlinear optics at the nanoscale .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate nonlinear optical wave mixing in doped nanographene .",
    "specifically , we propose a scheme for optimizing wave mixing among multifrequency optical fields that utilizes the plasmons supported by a doped graphene nanoisland .",
    "using a tight - binding description for the electronic structure combined with density - matrix quantum - mechanical simulations , we demonstrate that efficient wave mixing is achieved in an island when the incident and/or the mixed frequencies are coupled with one or more of its plasmons . by actively tuning the doping level in a graphene nanoisland of fixed geometry , a wide range of plasmon - enhanced input / output mixing frequency combinations can be realized .",

    "i.e. , linewidth @xmath5mev ) . from the linear absorption cross - section of the nanoisland , we identify several prominent plasmons for incident photon energies .",
    "in particular , we concentrate on @xmath6ev and @xmath7ev .",
    "the first of these plasmons is highly tunable upon electrical doping , as it is switched on when moving from @xmath8 to @xmath9 charge states ( see lower panel in fig .",

    "further , in fig .  [ fig1]b we superimpose the spectra obtained from coincident pulses with the spectra for excitation of the nanoisland by each of the individual pulses in isolation , which exhibit polarization features that oscillate at harmonics of the fundamental frequencies ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "the dual - pulse spectrum exhibits these features in addition to polarization components produced via sum and difference frequency generation ( @xmath15 ) and degenerate four - wave mixing ( @xmath16 or @xmath17 ) , along with various other combinations of harmonic generation and wave mixing .",
    "we note that for polarization along the edge of a nanotriangle , inversion symmetry in this direction prevents even - ordered nonlinear processes from occurring , such as shg and sum / difference frequency generation .",
    "incidentally , mixing of less tunable plasmons ( e.g. , @xmath18 with the resonance at @xmath19ev ) produces less intense nonlinear features ( see fig .",
    "[ figs2 ] in the appendix ) .        while the response of a graphene nanoisland to ultrashort pulses can provide information on the relative strengths of the nonlinear processes for excitation at specific frequencies , a quantitative analysis of each nonlinear process , along with its optimal plasmonic enhancement , is best provided by studying the response under continuous - wave ( cw ) illumination . in fig .",

    "prominent features also follow frequencies satisfying @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denotes one of the plasmon frequencies of the nanoisland , indicating plasmonic enhancement at the output ( sum ) frequency . finally ,",
    "since shg can be considered as a special case of sfg , we also note plasmonic enhancement of shg for frequencies satisfying @xmath26 .",
    "similar conclusions are drawn from frequency - difference generation ( i.e. , @xmath27 ) , where we observe enhancement when either one of the incident frequencies or the output frequency resonates with a plasmon ( see fig .",

    "we find a similar enhancement in @xmath29 when either of the fundamental frequencies of the incident fields are resonant with plasmons in the nanoisland , although in this case the enhancement favors @xmath30 , as @xmath12 is involved twice in these specific wave mixing processes . here",
    "we find increased four - wave mixing following the frequencies @xmath31 , once again indicating enhancement at the output frequency .",

    "we have also examined four - wave mixing with output frequency @xmath34 , leading to similar conclusions on plasmon - assisted enhancement ( see fig .",
    "[ figs4 ] in the appendix ) .        as noble metal nanoparticles possess the highest nonlinear polarizabilities per atom measured experimentally @xcite , we compare them with the above results for doped nanographene nonlinear polarizabilities . in particular , we contrast data available in the literature for metal third - order polarizabilities @xmath35 with those calculated here for graphene . in fig .  [",

    "even through metal particles have much larger volumes than graphene nanoislands for a given lateral size @xmath37 , we find the latter to exhibit much larger nonlinear response , reaching two orders of magnitude higher values .",
    "obviously , we are comparing theory for graphene with experiments for metals , so this is a preliminary conclusion , which should be examined experimentally .",
    "nonetheless , we are using a conservative inelastic lifetime for nanographene in our calculations ( @xmath4fs ) , whereas much longer lifetimes could be actually encountered in practice , based upon recently measured plasmon resonances @xcite , and it should be noted that the nonlinear polarizability of order @xmath38 scales roughly as @xmath39 @xcite .",

    "[ fig4]b , illustrating how the plasmon resonances vary as the nanoisland size increases while a fixed doping density is maintained .",
    "in conclusion , graphene nanoislands can be used to realize nonlinear wave mixing on the nanoscale with extraordinarily high efficiencies , surpassing those of metal nanoparticles of similar lateral sizes .",
    "the large magnitudes of the predicted nonlinear polarizabilities are attributed to plasmonic enhancement in these nanostructures .",
    "wave mixing is further enhanced by simultaneously exploiting multiple plasmonic resonances , enabling two incident fields with distinct frequencies to independently couple to plasmons , and additionally tuning the mixed frequency to yet another plasmon .",
    "these plasmons can be tuned by changing the number of doping charge carriers , adding another advantage with respect to conventional plasmonic metal response .",

    "<S> localized plasmons in metallic nanostructures have been widely used to enhance nonlinear optical effects due to their ability to concentrate and enhance light down to extreme - subwavelength scales . as alternatives to noble metal nanoparticles , graphene nanostructures can host long - lived plasmons that efficiently couple to light and are actively tunable via electrical doping . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that doped graphene nanoislands present unique opportunities for enhancing nonlinear optical wave - mixing processes between two externally applied optical fields at the nanoscale . </S>",
    "<S> these small islands can support pronounced plasmons at multiple frequencies , resulting in extraordinarily high wave - mixing susceptibilities when one or more of the input or output frequencies coincide with a plasmon resonance . by varying the doping charge density in a nanoisland with a fixed geometry , enhanced wave mixing can be realized over a wide spectral range in the visible and near infrared . </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate in particular on second- and third - order processes , including sum and difference frequency generation , as well as on four - wave mixing . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations for armchair graphene triangles composed of up to several hundred carbon atoms display large wave mixing polarizabilities compared with metal nanoparticles of similar lateral size , thus supporting nanographene as an excellent material for tunable nonlinear optical nanodevices . </S>"
