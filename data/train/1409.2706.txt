    "we consider the navier - stokes system for isentropic compressible viscous fluids driven by a multiplicative stochastic forcing and prove existence of a solution that is weak in both pde and probabilistic sense . to be more precise , let @xmath1 ^ 3 $ ] denote the three - dimensional torus , let @xmath2 and set @xmath3 .",

    "we suppose @xmath12 .",
    "finally , the viscosity coefficients @xmath13 satisfy @xmath14 the driving process @xmath15 is a cylindrical wiener process defined on some probability space @xmath16 and the coefficient @xmath17 is generally nonlinear and satisfies suitable growth conditions . the precise description of the problem setting will be given in the next section .",
    "the literature devoted to deterministic case is very extensive ( see for instance feireisl @xcite , feireisl , novotn and petzeltov @xcite , lions @xcite , novotn and strakraba @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the existence of weak solutions in the non - stationary setting is well - known provided @xmath12 ( in three dimensions , in two dimensions @xmath18 suffices instead ) .",
    "this might not be optimal but already covers important examples like mono - atomic gases where @xmath19 . in the stationary situation",
    "the results have been recently extended to @xmath18 , see @xcite .",
    "+ the theory for the stochastic counterpart still remains underdeveloped .",
    "the only available results ( see feireisl , maslowski and novotn @xcite for @xmath20 and @xcite in the case @xmath21 ) concern the navier - stokes system for compressible barotropic fluids under a stochastic perturbation of the form @xmath22 .",
    "this particular case of a multiplicative noise permits reduction of the problem . after applying some transformation",
    "it can be solved pathwise and therefore existence of a weak solution was established using deterministic arguments .",
    "this method has the drawback that the constructed solutions do not necessarily satisfy an energy inequality and are not progressively measurable ( hence the stochastic integral is not defined ) .",
    "we are not aware of any results concerning the navier - stokes equations for compressible fluids driven by a general multiplicative noise .",
    "nevertheless , study of such models is of essential interest as they were proposed as models for turbulence , see mikulevicius and rozovskii @xcite . in case of a more general noise ,",
    "the simplification mentioned before is no longer possible and methods from infinite - dimensional stochastic analysis are required .",
    "there is a bulk of literature available concerning stochastic versions of the incompressible navier - stokes equations .",
    "let us mention the pioneering paper by bensoussan and temam @xcite and for an overview of the known results , recent developments , as well as further references , we refer to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the literature concerning other fluid types is rather rare .",
    "just very recently first results on stochastic models for non - newtonian fluids appeared ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "incompressible non - homogenous fluids with stochastic forcing were studied in @xcite and more recently in @xcite ; one - dimensional stochastic isentropic euler equations in @xcite .",
    "we aim at a systematic study of compressible fluids under random perturbations .",
    "our main result is the existence of a weak martingale solution to in the sense of definition [ def : sol ] , see theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "our solution satisfies an energy inequality which shows the time evolution of the energy compared to the initial energy .",
    "the setting includes in particular the case of @xmath23 with two independent cylindrical wiener processes @xmath24 and @xmath25 and suitable growth assumptions on @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which is the main example we have in mind . here",
    "the first term describes some external force ; the case @xmath28 studied in @xcite is included but we could also allow nonlinear dependence in @xmath4 ( the case @xmath29 corresponds to the forcing @xmath30 from deterministic models ) .",
    "the second term is a friction term ; the model case is @xmath31 being proportional to the momentum @xmath32 but the dependence can be nonlinear as well .",
    "the solution is understood weakly in space - time ( in the sense of distributions ) and also weakly in the probabilistic sense ( the underlying probability space is part of the solution ) .",
    "such a concept of solution is very common in the theory of stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) , in particular in fluid dynamics when the corresponding uniqueness is often not known .",
    "we refer the reader to subsection [ subsec : solution ] for a detailed discussion of this issue .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] relies on a four layer approximation scheme that is motivated by the technique developed by feireisl , novotn and petzeltov @xcite in order to deal with the corresponding deterministic counterpart . in each step",
    "we are confronted with the limit procedure in several nonlinear terms and in the stochastic integral .",
    "there is one significant difference in comparison to the deterministic situation leading to the concept of martingale solution : in general it is not possible to get any compactness in @xmath33 as no topological structure on the sample space @xmath34 is assumed . to overcome this difficulty , it is classical to rather concentrate on compactness of the set of laws of the approximations and apply the skorokhod representation theorem .",
    "it yields existence of a new probability space with a sequence of random variables that have the same laws as the original ones and that in addition converges almost surely . however , a major drawback is that the skorokhod representation theorem is restricted to metric spaces .",
    "the structure of the compressible navier - stokes equations naturally leads to weakly converging sequences . on account of this",
    "we work with the jakubowski - skorokhod theorem which is valid on a large class of topological spaces ( including separable banach spaces with weak topology ) .",
    "further discussion of the key ideas of the proof is postponed to subsection [ subsec : outline ] .",
    "the exposition is organized as follows . in section [ sec : framework ] we continue with the introductory part : we introduce the basic set - up , the concept of solution and state the main result , theorem [ thm : main ] . once the notation is fixed we present also a short outline of the proof , subsection [ subsec : outline ] .",
    "the remainder of the paper is devoted to the detailed proof of theorem [ thm : main ] that proceeds in several steps .",
    "to begin with , let us set up the precise conditions on the random perturbation of the system .",
    "let @xmath35 be a stochastic basis with a complete , right - continuous filtration .",
    "the process @xmath15 is a cylindrical wiener process , that is , @xmath36 with @xmath37 being mutually independent real - valued standard wiener processes relative to @xmath38 . here",
    "@xmath39 denotes a complete orthonormal system in a separable hilbert space @xmath40 ( e.g. @xmath41 would be a natural choice ) . to give the precise definition of the diffusion coefficient @xmath17 , consider @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 such that @xmath45 .",
    "we recall that we assume @xmath12 .",
    "+ denote @xmath46 and let @xmath47 be defined as follows @xmath48 the coefficients @xmath49 are @xmath50-functions that satisfy uniformly in @xmath51 @xmath52 remark that in this setting @xmath53 is the natural space for values of the operator @xmath54 . indeed , due to lack of a priori estimates for it is not possible to consider @xmath55 as a mapping with values in a space with higher integrability .",
    "this fact brings difficulties concerning the definition of the stochastic integral in .",
    "in fact , the space @xmath53 does neither belong to the class 2-smooth banach spaces nor to the class of umd banach spaces where the theory of stochastic it - integration is well - established ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , since we expect the momentum equation to be satisfied only in the sense of distributions anyway , we make use of the embedding @xmath56 ( which is true provided @xmath57 ) .",
    "hence we understand the stochastic integral as a process in the hilbert space @xmath58 .",
    "to be more precise , it is easy to check that under the above assumptions on @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the mapping @xmath54 belongs to @xmath61 , the space of hilbert - schmidt operators from @xmath40 to @xmath58 .",
    "indeed , due to there holds @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the mean value of @xmath59 over @xmath64 .",
    "consequently , if denotes the predictable @xmath65-algebra associated to @xmath66 . ]",
    "@xmath67 and the mean value @xmath68 is essentially bounded then the stochastic integral @xmath69 is a well - defined @xmath66-martingale taking values in @xmath58 .",
    "note that the continuity equation implies that the mean value @xmath70 of the density @xmath4 is constant in time ( but in general depends on @xmath33 ) .",
    "finally , we define the auxiliary space @xmath71 via @xmath72 endowed with the norm @xmath73 note that the embedding @xmath74 is hilbert - schmidt .",

    "we aim at establishing existence of a solution to that is weak in both probabilistic and pdes sense .",
    "let us devote this subsection to the introduction of these two notions .",
    "from the point of view of the theory of pdes , we follow the approach of @xcite and consider the so - called finite energy weak solutions . in particular , the system is satisfied in the sense of distributions , the corresponding energy inequality holds true and , moreover , the continuum equation is satisfied in the renormalized sense .    from the probabilistic point of view ,",
    "two concepts of solution are typically considered in the theory of stochastic evolution equations , namely , pathwise ( or strong ) solutions and martingale ( or weak ) solutions . in the former notion the underlying probability space as well as the driving process",
    "is fixed in advance while in the latter case these stochastic elements become part of the solution of the problem .",
    "clearly , existence of a pathwise solution is stronger and implies existence of a martingale solution . in the present work we are only able to establish existence of a martingale solution to . due to classical yamada - watanabe - type argument",
    "( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , existence of a pathwise solution would then follow if pathwise uniqueness held true .",
    "however , uniqueness for the navier  stokes equations for compressible fluids is an open problem even in the deterministic setting .",
    "in hand with this issue goes the way how the initial condition is posed : there is given a probability measure on @xmath77 , hereafter denoted by @xmath78 .",
    "it fulfills some further assumptions specified in theorem [ thm : main ] and plays the role of an initial law for the system .",

    "note that the density does not require any boundary assumptions in the weak formulation ) .",
    "however , with a bit of additional work our theory can also be applied to the case of no - slip boundary conditions .",
    "furthermore , the reader might observe that the assumption upon the initial law @xmath78 that implies @xmath120 a.s .",

    "we regularize the continuum equation by a second order term and modify correspondingly the momentum equation so that the energy inequality is preserved .",
    "in addition , we consider an artificial pressure term that allows to weaken the hypothesis upon the adiabatic constant @xmath8 .",

    "the term @xmath125 is added to the momentum equation to maintain the energy balance . in order to ensure its convergence to 0 in the vanishing viscosity limit",

    "it yields an estimate for @xmath127 which is uniformly in @xmath128 by .",
    "the aim is to pass to the limit first in @xmath129 and subsequently in @xmath130 , however , in order to solve for @xmath131 and @xmath132 fixed we need two additional approximation layers .",
    "in particular , we employ a stopping time technique to establish the existence of a unique solution to a finite - dimensional approximation of .",

    "it is then showed that the blow up can not occur in a finite time .",
    "so letting @xmath138 gives a unique solution to the faedo - galerkin approximation on the whole time interval @xmath139 $ ] .",
    "the passage to the limit as @xmath140 yields existence of a solution to .    except for the first passage to the limit ,",
    "i.e. as @xmath138 , we always employ the stochastic compactness method .",
    "let us discuss briefly its main features .",
    "the compactness method is widely used for solving various pdes : one approximates the model problem , finds suitable uniform estimates proving that the set of approximate solutions is relatively compact in some path space and this leads to convergence of a subsequence whose limit is shown to fulfill the target equation .",
    "the situation is more involved in the stochastic setting due to presence of the additional variable @xmath33 .",
    "indeed , generally it is not possible to get any compactness in @xmath33 as no topological structure on @xmath34 is assumed . to overcome this issue , one concentrates rather on compactness of the set of laws of the approximations and then the skorokhod representation theorem comes into play .",
    "it gives existence of a new probability space with a sequence of random variables that have the same laws as the original ones ( so they can be shown to satisfy the same approximate problems though with different wiener processes ) and that in addition converge almost surely .",
    "powerful as it sounds there is one drawback of the classical skorokhod representation theorem ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 11.7.2 ) ) : it is restricted to random variables taking values in separable metric spaces .",
    "nevertheless , jakubowski @xcite gave a suitable generalization of this result that holds true in the class of so - called quasi - polish spaces .",
    "that is , topological spaces that are not metrizable but retain several important properties of polish spaces ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3 ) for further discussion ) .",
    "namely , separable banach spaces equipped with weak topology or spaces of weakly continuous functions with values in a separable banach space belong to this class which perfectly covers the needs of our paper .    another important ingredient of the proof is then the identification of the limit procedure . to be more precise ,",
    "the difficulties arise in the passage of the limit in the stochastic integral as one now deals with a sequence of stochastic integrals driven by a sequence of wiener processes .",
    "one possibility is to pass to the limit directly and such technical convergence results appeared in several works ( see @xcite or @xcite ) , a detailed proof can be found in @xcite .",
    "another way is to show that the limit process is a martingale , identify its quadratic variation and apply an integral representation theorem for martingales , if available ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our proof relies on neither of those and follows a rather new general and elementary method that was introduced in @xcite and already generalized to different settings ( see @xcite for the application to quasi - polish spaces ) .",
    "the keystone is to identify not only the quadratic variation of the corresponding martingale but also its cross variation with the limit wiener process obtained through compactness .",
    "this permits to conclude directly without use of any further difficult results .",
    "in this section , we present the first part of our proof of theorem [ thm : main ] . in particular , we prove existence of a unique solution to a faedo - galerkin approximation of the following viscous problem where @xmath141 and @xmath142 . to be more precise , let us consider a suitable orthogonal system formed by a family of smooth functions @xmath143 .",
