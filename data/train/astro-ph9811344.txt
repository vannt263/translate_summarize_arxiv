    "the mit  green bank ( mg ) survey ( bennett 1986 ; lawrence 1986 ) consists of 5974 radio sources in 1.87 steradians of sky in an equatorial strip which have flux densities @xmath9 mjy at 5 ghz .",
    "studies of higher  flux density radio surveys such as the 3cr ( spinrad & djorgovski 1987 ) , molonglo ( mccarthy 1996 ) , and b2/1 jy of allington  smith ( 1982 ) have yielded many interesting discoveries , such as the radio  optical alignment of high  redshift radio galaxies ( chambers 1987 ; mccarthy 1987 ) , very high  redshift galaxies ( lacy 1995 ; spinrad , dey , & graham 1995 ; rawlings 1996 ) , and rich clusters at high  redshift ( dickinson 1996 ) .",
    "the mg survey probes the parameter space between high flux density surveys such as the 3cr , and milli and micro ",
    "jansky surveys such as the leiden berkeley deep survey and its extensions ( neuschaefer & windhorst 1995 ) . the mg range of radio flux density is also considered by the b3 survey ( vigotti 1989 ) and recent cambridge surveys ( 6c  hales , baldwin , & warner 1993 ) , but the mg survey was conducted at a higher frequency than these other surveys . selecting an intermediate power sample allows us to study various properties as a function of radio power .",
    "in particular , a lower radio power suggests these galaxies may , on average , be less dominated by their active nuclei , and may thus be more representative of giant ellipticals at large redshift ( dunlop 1996 ; spinrad 1997 ; dey 1998 ) .",
    "fainter flux densities also suggest that a fraction of our sample may be at very high redshift , and indeed the median redshift of radio galaxies in the mg observed to this point is @xmath10 compared to @xmath11 for the 3cr ( mccarthy 1993 ) .    over the past several years",
    "we have been pursuing the optical identification of a subset of 218 radio sources systematically selected from the mg catalog .",
    "we restrict our sample to radio sources of small angular size ( @xmath12 ) , simple ( unresolved , double , or triple ) radio morphology , and moderately steep radio spectral index ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the size and morphological criteria primarily select against objects at low redshift .",
    "the angular size limit should also bias the sample to larger lookback times when the higher density of the intergalactic medium is more effective at confining radio lobes .",
    "the spectral index criterion eliminates low ",
    "redshift interlopers and selects against flat ",
    "spectrum quasars and in favor of radio galaxies , but is only moderately restrictive amongst the radio galaxies themselves ( blumenthal & miley 1979 ) .",
    "resulting identifications are often very distant objects and thus serve as useful probes for the study of galaxy formation and evolution . in combination with other complete samples , such as the 3cr ,",
    "optical and near  ir properties of mg sources can be used in correlative studies which span a range of radio power at any given redshift .",
    "similar studies suggest that weak radio sources ( @xmath13 mjy ) have weaker emission lines and the alignment effect becomes less pronounced with lower radio flux density samples ( rawlings & saunders 1991 ; dunlop & peacock 1993 ; eales & rawlings 1993 ; thompson 1994 ) .",
    "mccarthy ( 1993 ) has a recently presented a comprehensive review on the optical and associated properties of radio galaxies .",
    "preliminary results from our survey are described in spinrad ( 1993 ) , dey , spinrad , & dickinson ( 1995 ) , and stern ( 1996 ; 1997 ) . currently , we have optical identifications for @xmath14% of our sample and spectroscopic redshifts for @xmath15% of the sample . in this paper",
    "we report on seventeen new identifications and redshifts of mg sources .",
    "the spectra were obtained at the w.m .",
    "keck telescopes and are representative of some of the fainter radio identifications thus far .",
    "typical @xmath16 magnitudes are @xmath17 many of these sources are in the so ",
    "called ` redshift desert , ' @xmath18 for which no strong features ( , ly@xmath19 , 2 , or h@xmath19 ) are redshifted into the optical window , thus making redshift determinations challenging .",
    "our mg sample currently includes 13 galaxies with @xmath20 ; we report on 4 such galaxies here .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  2 we present the observations and data reductions , followed by a discussion of individual systems in  3 . we construct a composite spectrum and compare it with models and other composite spectra of active galaxies in  4 .",
    "a concluding discussion comprises  5 .",
    "throughout this paper we adopt @xmath21 and @xmath22 unless otherwise noted .",
    "preliminary imaging observations of all sources were made over the course of several years ( 1988 @xmath23 1998 ) at the lick observatory 3 m shane telescope on mount hamilton and the mdm 2.4 m hiltner telescope at kitt peak .",
    "the kast double spectrograph of lick observatory ( miller & stone 1994 ) employs uv  flooded reticon 1200x400 ccds with 27@xmath24 m pixels , corresponding to a plate scale of 078 pix@xmath25 typical seeing for the lick imaging was 12  18 . the charlotte camera of mdm employs a tek 1024@xmath26 ccd detector with a plate scale of 0275 pix@xmath25 typical seeing for these images was 10  15 .",
    "a subsample of seven of the seventeen sources were later reimaged with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke 1995 ) at the 10 m w.m .",
    "keck telescopes on mauna kea between 1994 and 1998 .",
    "the detector is a tek 2048@xmath26 ccd with 24@xmath24 m pixels . due to a dewar change in july 1996 ,",
    "the pixel scale changed from 0214 pix@xmath27 to 0212 pix@xmath27 at that time .",
    "the typical seeing was 08  10 .",
    "a journal of our observations is provided in table  [ obsns ] .",
    "the images were corrected for overscan bias , flattened using a median sky flat , coadded , and calibrated using observations of standard stars .",
    "utilizing astrometry provided by b. burke and s. conner , we obtained optical identifications for our candidates based upon the radio coordinates .",
    "typically the optical morphologies are small , faint , and round .",
    "we present finding charts in fig .",
    "[ plate ] ( plates 1  3 ) .",
    "where available , we present keck images ; the remaining images were obtained at lick and the mdm as indicated in table  [ obsns ] .",
    "astrometry for each identification is tabulated in table  [ astrom ] with the coordinates of the offset star provided .",
    "the estimated uncertainty in the optical positions is 03 .",
    "optical and radio properties of the sources are in table  [ prop ] , where the radio flux densities and spectral indices are from bennett ( 1986 ) and lawrence ( 1986 ) .",
    "radio luminosities have been calculated at a rest  frame frequency of 4.8  ghz , implementing the spectral index derived from 1.4 and 4.8 ghz observations , a hubble constant of @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in table",
    "[ radflux ] we include more recent 4.85 ghz flux densities for the sample .",
    "many sources may vary at the 10% level over the 10 year baseline , though mg  2058 + 0542 apparently varied considerably more over the same period .",
    "we therefore indicate its spectral index as uncertain in table  [ prop ] .",
    "magnitudes , measured in site ",
    "dependent apertures as described in table  [ prop ] , are from our ccd photometry and have errors of @xmath30 to @xmath31 magnitudes .",
    "observations obtained at lick observatory employed the spinrad night ",
    "sky filter and yield red magnitudes in the @xmath32 system , which is related to commonly used photometric systems by djorgovski ( 1985 ) .",
    "typical optical magnitudes are @xmath33 probing the fainter envelope of our mg survey .      we obtained spectroscopic observations with lris between 1994 and 1997 .",
    "we generally used a 300  @xmath34/mm grating ( blazed at 5000   ) to sample a wavelength range @xmath44000@xmath239000   , and a 1 arcsecond wide slit which yields an effective resolution fwhm of @xmath35 10   .",
    "the read noise and gain were typically 8.0@xmath36 and 1.6@xmath36 adu@xmath27 respectively .",
    "however , during the 1994 march run , the lris ccd was affected by pattern noise which mimicked extremely high read noise ( 25@xmath36 and 65@xmath36 on the blue and red sides ) , noticeably degrading the spectrum of mg  1251 + 1104 .",
    "observations were typically done at an airmass @xmath37 .",
    "hence , although the slit position angle was often selected to trace the radio morphology or to include nearby optical sources , we believe our relative spectrophotometry to be accurate for the wavelengths considered ( filippenko 1982 ) .",
    "the sources attempted spectroscopically at keck were primarily selected from the fainter ( @xmath38 ) identifications in the mg survey , many having been unsuccessful spectroscopic targets at lick observatory .",
    "exceptions are the relatively bright sources mg  0422 + 0816 ( @xmath39 ) and mg  0511 + 0143 ( @xmath40 ) which were first observed spectroscopically as a backup project at keck observatory on an inclement night .",
    "these observations utilized a 600  @xmath34/mm grating ( blazed at 5000   ) .",
    "the bright quasar mg  2041 + 1854 ( @xmath39 ) was observed at keck during twilight on a cirrusy night , while the relatively bright ( @xmath41 ) sources mg  0148 + 1028 and mg  0308 + 0720 were first surveyed spectroscopically as backup targets on 23 december 1997 ut .",
    "for each observation , we offset the telescope from the reference star listed in table  [ astrom ] .",
    "the data were corrected for overscan bias , flat  fielded using internal lamps taken after each observation , flux calibrated using observations of spectrophotometric standard stars ( massey 1988 ; massey & gronwall 1990 ) , and corrected for galactic reddening using the burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) maps ( see table  [ prop ] ) with the cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) extinction curve .",
    "one  dimensional spectra were extracted with a typical aperture size of 14 .",
    "the standard stars were observed both with and without an og570 filter in order to correct for the second order light contaminating the wavelength region @xmath42 .",

    "mg  0148 + 1028 , at z=2.845 , _ is an intriguing source showing both the bright emission lines typical of high  redshift radio galaxies and the narrow absorption lines that characterize high  redshift , star  forming galaxies ( steidel 1996 , lowenthal 1997 ) .",

    "a detailed analysis of mg  0148 + 1028 is deferred to future publication ; note , however , that 5 , an unambiguous signature of starlight ( dey 1997 ) , is visible in absorption . the finding chart for this galaxy derives from a short ( 60@xmath44 ) exposure obtained through lris without a filter to identify the field ; this image is superior to the 1260@xmath44 lick image .",

    "mg  0308 + 0720 , at z=2.975 , _ is a radio  loud quasar as evidenced by the broad emission lines ( fwhm ( ) @xmath43 5600 km s@xmath27 ) and unresolved morphology .",
    "the ly@xmath195 emission complex is unusual , with narrow ly@xmath19 superimposed upon a broad 5 emission line .",
    "recent statistical investigations of broad uv lines in luminous ( radio  quiet ) quasars have suggested that the traditional broad  line region ( blr ) consists of two components  a low  density , intermediate  line region ( ilr ; fwhm @xmath43 2000 km s@xmath27 ) and a higher density , very broad line region ( vblr ; fwhm @xmath49 7000 km s@xmath27 ) blueshifted by @xmath49 1000 km s@xmath27 with respect to the ilr ( brotherton 1994 ) .",
    "differences in the relative contributions of these two components can explain much of the observed variation in quasar broad  line profiles . for instance , ly@xmath19 will come predominantly from the ilr , while higher ionization lines such as 5 ,  @xmath41394 , 1403 , and 4 are dominated by vblr emission . in this simple model ,",
    "mg  0308 + 0720 is a quasar whose broad  lines are dominated by the vblr ; indeed , the ly@xmath19 spectral profile looks similar to that of the composite vblr presented in fig .  2a of brotherton ( 1994 ) .",

    "line width trend in mcl98 likely reflects a redshift  line width correlation , in the sense that higher redshift radio galaxies have broader emission lines .",
    "this is unlikely to be a selection effect , as the 3cr is nearly completely identified .",
    "we measure an average restframe equivalent width of 300    for the ly@xmath19 emission line in the keck / mg radio galaxy sample . for comparison , from a sample of 28 radio galaxies with @xmath71 similar to the redshift range in the current sample , mccarthy ( 1993 )",
    "finds a mean rest ",
    "frame @xmath72 of @xmath73   . radio ",
    "quiet , lyman  break galaxies with ly@xmath19 in emission have a typical @xmath72 of @xmath74    ( steidel 1996 ) .",
    "mcl98 find that their composite radio galaxy spectrum has very strong ly@xmath19 relative to 5 , 4 , and 3 , as compared to other agn .",
    "the mg composite , however , has much weaker ly@xmath19 , with line ratios more typical of the other agn in table  [ compare ] .",
    "most likely the radio galaxy discrepancies stem from the small number of ly@xmath19 emitters in the composite spectra .",
    "the 3c / mrc composite ly@xmath19 comprises 7 galaxies , while the mg composite ly@xmath19 comprises only 3 galaxies , one of which is known to be underluminous in ly@xmath19 , likely due to dust absorption ( mg  1019 + 0534 , dey , spinrad , & dickinson 1995 ) .",
    "however , one could also imagine a ly@xmath19radio power dependency , similar to the known 2  1.4 ghz radio power relation ( mccarthy 1993 ) , or that the mgs typically reside in dustier or more cold  gas  rich host galaxies .    at longer wavelengths , where the spectra are less affected by small number statistics ,",
    "there are several significant differences between the radio galaxy composites .",
    "most strikingly , the 2 doublet is one of the most prominent lines in the mg composite , with 2 / 3 @xmath75 and ly@xmath19 / 2 @xmath76 in the 3c / mrc composite , however , the 2 doublet is relatively weak , with 2 / 3 @xmath77 and ly@xmath19 / 2 @xmath78 the 2 / 2 line ratio also shows significant variation between the composite radio galaxy spectra : 2 / 2 @xmath79 for the mg sample , while 2 / 2 @xmath80 for the 3c / mrc composite .",
    "these strong discrepancies are difficult to interpret , though the mg line ratios are intriguingly more similar to those of liners and quasars than to the 3c / mrc composite radio galaxy or seyfert iis ( see table  [ compare ] ) .",
    "we note that the 2 line in the mg composite is composed from five spectra , suggesting that small number statistics may still be the source of the these suggestive trends .",
    "the strengths of the various ionization stages of carbon are a more useful diagnostic of the excitation mechanisms in active galaxies : selecting emission lines from the same element avoids metallicity dependencies , while the small wavelength separation of the lines considered makes the conclusions relatively insensitive to reddening . in fig .",
    "[ carbon ] we plot 4 / 3 vs. 3 / 2 for individual galaxies in the mg sample , the composite spectra from table  [ compare ] , and the models described below .",
    "we find that the mg composite appears to be in a lower ionization state than the 3c / mrc composite , with carbon line ratios more comparable to the liner nucleus of ngc  4579 than to the quasar composites .",
    "again , an alternative explanation is that mgs typically reside in dustier galaxies than 3c / mrc sources .",
    "unfortunately , the limited optical window and high redshift of the current sample deny us access to the line pairs commonly used for dust extinction measurements , such as h@xmath19/h@xmath81 , ly@xmath19/h@xmath81 , and 2/2b .",
    "however , the strength of the ly@xmath19 line , which is quite sensitive to dust , implies that there is not an immense amount of reddening in the mg composite , while the dramatic change in the 2 strength between the 3c / mrc composite and the mg composite suggests that there is a significant difference between the emission line regions in these two radio galaxy populations .",
    "finally , the relatively high 2 / 4 ratio indicates that the mg composite is in a lower ionization state as compared to the higher radio power 3c / mrc composite , despite the 4 line residing redwards of the the carbon lines so that dust reddening alone can not explain the line ratio difference .",
    "this suggests that the ionization state of radio galaxies correlates with radio power . in a detailed study of lower redshift ( @xmath82 ) southern 2  jy radio sources , however , tadhunter ( 1998 )",
    "find ionization state , as measured by the 2/ [ ]  @xmath35007 ratio , does not correlate with radio power .    to test the hypothesis of a radio power ",
    "ionization state relation in high redshift radio galaxies , we have amassed a sample of 30 radio galaxies with published 4 and 3 fluxes from the literature . in fig .",
    "5 we plot 4 / 3 vs. rest  frame 1.4 ghz radio power .",
    "there is a slight tendency for the stronger radio sources to have larger 4 / 3 ratios , implying higher ionization states . to test the significance the correlation ,",
    "we have calculated the nonparametric spearman rank correlation coefficient , @xmath83 , for this sample , and find a value of @xmath84 .",
    "note that this statistic is independent of cosmology . the null hypothesis , that no correlation exists between radio power and ionization state can be marginally rejected : the probability of obtaining a rank correlation coefficient this high from a sample of 30 uncorrelated variables is 3.5% .",
    "if we restrict our analysis to the two larger data sets , , the keck / mg and ultra - steep source ( uss ) samples , then @xmath85 for a sample of 25 sources .",
    "the probability of obtaining a rank correlation coefficient this high from a sample of 25 uncorrelated variables is 1.5% , implying that the correlation is significant .",
    "we consider these statistical arguments suggestive , but not conclusive , of a radio power ",
    "ionization state correlation in the uv spectra of high  redshift radio galaxies .",
    "insufficient sources with both 2 and 2 well  detected prevented a similar analysis to be done with the 2 / 2 ratio .",
    "we have computed simple , single ",
    "zone photoionization models using cloudy ( ferland 1996 ) .",
    "the purpose of this exercise is not to fabricate a definitive model of the radio galaxy spectrum , but rather to demonstrate that a simple low density gas photoionization model can reproduce the overall character of the spectrum and compare the best  fit parameters with those derived for the 3c / mrc composite .",
    "following mcl98 , our calculations were made for an ionization bounded slab of gas with a constant density of @xmath86 @xmath87 illuminated by a power  law spectrum of ionizing radiation , @xmath88 we calculated models with a range of spectral index , @xmath89 and ionization parameter , @xmath90 . for reference",
    ", mcl98 found that @xmath91 and @xmath92 provided the best fit to the composite 3c / mrc spectrum .",
    "we find that the carbon line diagnostics are not well  reproduced by these simple models .",
    "for example , the best  fit cloudy model of mcl98 is represented by an asterisk in fig .",
    "though this model does a reasonable job at reproducing the overall character of the 3c / mrc emission line spectrum , the 3 / 2 ratio is much higher in the model than in the composite spectrum .",
    "2d of allen ( 1998 ) is also enlightening : for a given 4 / 3 ratio , the 2 emission line is again too strong in the comparison agn spectra to be fit by simple single  zone photoionization models .",
    "photoionization models which incorporate both optically thick ( ionization bounded ) clouds and optically thin ( matter bounded ) clouds , as described in binnette ( 1996 ) , are capable of reproducing the observed carbon line diagnostics , as are the shock models of dopita & sutherland ( 1996 ) , implying that ( the mg ) radio galaxies are more complicated than our basic model .",
    "investigations also reveal that the high equivalent width 2 line is also difficult to reproduce with the simple model : for @xmath93 and @xmath94 no model is capable of reproducing the 2 / 3 ratio we find in the mg composite radio galaxy spectrum , indicating that shocks and/or more complicated photoionization scenarios are necessary to explain the emission line spectra of these galaxies .",
    "we present optical identifications , finding charts , and spectra for seventeen new high  redshift radio sources selected from the mg 5  ghz survey .",
    "we select targets of moderately steep spectral index to preferentially observe radio galaxies , and , indeed , fifteen of the seventeen sources discussed herein are radio galaxies .",
    "the remaining two sources are moderately steep  spectrum , radio  loud quasars which may be important in terms of unified models of extragalactic radio sources .",
    "the spectra were all taken at the w.m .",
    "keck telescopes and are representative of the fainter mg identifications attempted thus far , with typical @xmath16 magnitudes of @xmath17    we construct a composite mg radio galaxy spectrum and compare it with the higher  radio power composite 3c / mrc radio galaxy spectrum of mcl98 . we find that the mg radio galaxies typically exhibit lower ionization state spectra than the 3c / mrc radio galaxies .",
    "the 2 emission line is extremely strong in the mg composite relative to the other rest  frame uv emission lines , with 2 / 3 @xmath95 and 2 / @xmath96 .",
    "extensive modeling with single ",
    "zone photoionization models are incapable of reproducing the high 2 / 3 ratio , indicating that shocks and/or more complicated photoionization scenarios are producing the emission line spectra of these distant radio galaxies .",
    "we have amassed a large sample of high  redshift radio galaxies with published 4 and 3 line strengths . comparing the 4 / 3 ratio to the rest ",
    "frame 1.4  ghz radio power , we find evidence for a correlation between ionization state and radio power .",
    "a likely interpretation is that the more powerful radio sources are in an active phase when the central engine is emitting more flux across the electromagnetic spectrum with the augmented uv flux leading to higher ionization state spectra .",
    "as we progress from the strongest radio sources to weaker sources , we find the emission line strengths attenuate , the ionization state of the emission line region diminishes , and the stellar populations apparently become more dominant .",
    "this last effect is seen both in the diminished alignment affect for weak radio sources and the discovery of several weak radio sources at moderate redshift whose spectra are devoid of the uv emission lines that dominate most radio galaxy spectra ( spinrad 1997 ) .",
    "an alternative explanation is to invoke multiple emission line regions whose relative contributions vary with radio power .",
    "the high  redshift radio galaxies discussed herein are faint , and the radio power  line strength correlation implies that long integrations with the new generation of large aperture telescopes is necessary to measure the emission line strengths and redshifts of these sources .",
    "redshift radio galaxies from a range of radio flux density will be the key to further investigations of the ionization state ",
