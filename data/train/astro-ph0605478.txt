    "physics around black holes , including accretion of material and launching of jets , has been a fundamental question in astronomy for a long time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is not yet clearly known how accreting material disposes of its angular momentum while falling into a black hole , and how and where a jet is launched from around a black hole . with a jet of 100",
    "pc scale observed ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) of seyfert galaxies are the best targets to attack the mystery of accreting material and jets .",
    "there are two classes of seyfert galaxies ; seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 .",
    "they have similarities and differences in , for example , their visible spectra , which are commonly known to be explained with the unified model @xcite . according to the unified model",
    ", an agn has a black hole at its heart .",
    "material falls down into the black hole through an accretion disk while emitting x - ray and uv light . throughout this paper",
    ", we define the system of the black hole and the accretion disk as `` central engine '' following @xcite .",
    "the unified model proposes three classes of clouds around the central engine .",
    "first , narrow line regions ( nlrs ) spread over @xmath0 100  pc and emit permitted and forbidden lines with velocity widths of @xmath1  km  sec@xmath2 .",
    "second , broad line regions ( blrs ) in the vicinity of the central engine emit permitted lines of @xmath3  km  sec@xmath2 velocity widths .",
    "third , an opaque compact but geometrically thick dusty torus around the central engine hides the direct view to the central engine and their blrs from our line of sight when the central engine is viewed through the torus .",
    "the dusty torus is the key to the unified model because it is the one which distinguishes seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 : seyfert 2 nuclei are viewed through the dusty torus and blrs are only seen in scattered light .",
    "ngc 1068 is one of the nearest seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "many observations have revealed various features that confirm the unified model ; an accretion disk of 1  pc scale @xcite , the seyfert 1 nucleus seen in polarized light @xcite , and nlrs @xcite .",
    "however , no clear image of the dusty torus has been obtained ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "only recently , @xcite found a 2.1  pc scale emission component of warm ( 320  k ) dust surrounding a more compact hot ( @xmath4  k ) dust component with the mid - infrared interferometric instrument coupled to the very large telescope interferometer .",
    "they identified the hot component as the inner wall of the dusty torus .",
    "it is a step towards clear images of the dusty torus including its temperature structure , density distribution , and relations with structures in larger and smaller scales .    on the other hand ,",
    "the inner radii of the dusty tori are being measured with reverberation mapping .",
    "this method measures lag time of light curves of an agn in the _ v_-band and that in the _ k_-band . in reverberation mapping , the measured lag time is interpreted as the time duration in which light from the agn reaches the inner wall of the dusty torus . multiplying the lag with the speed of light",
    ", the inner radius of the dusty torus @xmath5 can be obtained .",
    "@xcite found a good correlation between lags and absolute magnitudes in the _ v_-band in a number of seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "it implies that @xmath5 is governed by luminosity of the central engine . adopting their results , minimum @xmath5 for ngc 1068",
    "is estimated to be @xmath0  0.045  pc from @xmath6  11.5  mag @xcite .",
    "the estimated radius is consistent with the upper limit of 1  pc measured by @xcite .",
    "the method seems to be promising in unveiling the innermost structures of dusty clouds around agns .",
    "however , we have to note that the results do not necessarily require the dusty clouds around the agns to be in the shape of a torus .",
    "it is still critical to obtain direct images of dusty tori .",
    "it is best to look for a dusty torus in the infrared ( ir ) . first , from thermal equilibrium",
    ", it is expected that dust in a torus of 10  pc scale radiates mainly around 10   @xcite .",
    "next , there are absorption / emission features of carbonaceous dust at 3.4   and of silicate dust at 9.7  .",
    "comparison of the dust features may be used to probe the temperature structure of a dusty torus as has been suggested by @xcite .",
    "l_-band emission is dominated by dust at @xmath7  k , the 3.4   absorption feature should originate from the dust clouds in a few pc from the central engine @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the 9.7   absorption feature only measures the extinction towards the outer region of the dusty torus because dust of @xmath8  k , which is the dominant source of the mid - infrared ( mir ) emission , is located further out from the heating source .",
    "therefore , the combination of mir spectra ( 8    13  ) and _ l_-band spectra ( 2.8  4.2  ) would probe the temperature distribution of dust in the line of sight through the dusty torus .    this paper reports the results from observations of ngc 1068 in the mir and in the _ l_-band with the subaru telescope , which is best suited for this study with the superb image quality in ir .",
    "two instruments , the mid - infrared test observation system ( mirtos ) and the infrared camera and spectrograph ( ircs ) , were used with the fine pixel scales optimized for the image quality of the telescope . the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : sections [ sec : mir ] and [ sec : nir ] describe observations and data reduction in the mir and in the _",

    "@xcite measured positions of the various spatial structures in the ngc 1068 nucleus observed at different wavelengths and found that the central engine is at the ir peak .",

    "mir imaging observations of ngc 1068 with the `` silicate filters '' ( @xmath11 ) at 7.7 , 8.8 , 9.7 , 10.4 , 11.7 , and 12.3   were made on 1999 december 31 , 2000 january 9 , and 2000 january 18 ut .",

    "sequences of 96 images of 31  msec integration were obtained . between the sequences ,",
    "the telescope was nodded typically 30 to the north to acquire background images . in this study ,",
    "the data described in @xcite were reduced again with the higher computing power available today .",
    "many short - exposure images with 31  msec integration time were shifted - and - added to construct high - resolution images in each filter .",
    "first , background images , which were made with averaging the short - exposure images in the nodding pair , were subtracted from the raw images .",
    "second , bad pixels and detector array specific features were corrected .",
    "third , the peak position of the object in each image was measured with a precision of one tenth of a pixel with gaussian fitting .",
    "the fwhm of the gaussian was fixed to be the same as that of the airy pattern to pick up the brightest speckle .",
    "fourth , each pixel of the images was divided to 10 times 10 pixels resulting with a pixel scale of 00067 .",

    "flux uncertainty was estimated at about 9% from the measurement of the other standard star @xmath12  cma @xcite .",
    "the shifted - and - added image of each filter was registered and convolved to have the same fwhm of @xmath0 037 ( 26  pc ) as follows .",
    "the peak position of the object for each filter was measured by gaussian fitting of the pixels with flux more than 75% of the peak .",
    "the images were registered assuming that the peaks for each filters are at the same location on the sky @xcite .",
    "the images are then gaussian convolved so that all the images have a similar fwhm .",

    "the _ iso_-sws spectrum in the 14 @xmath13 27 aperture @xcite is also shown for comparison . the flux density measured from the mirtos images are consistent with the flux density of the continuum in the sws spectrum .",
    "we fitted the mir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with a grey body emission model including the silicate feature to estimate the temperature and amount of mir emitting dust , as well as optical depth of the silicate absorption / emission feature .",
    "it should be noted that the extracted parameters do not represent the entire physical conditions but only characterize distributions of dust in some aspects as described below .",

    "the @xmath18  cep extinction curve is used in this work to compare the silicate feature with the 3.4   feature as has been done by @xcite .",
    "the 7.7   image was not used because the ir excess data does not cover the short wavelength .",
    "the peak wavelength of the silicate absorption feature seen in the seds in figure [ fig : mirspec ] is different from that observed towards @xmath18  cep : the peak wavelength of the absorption is shifted from 9.7   to 10.4   especially at the central peak .",
    "because of this , the 10.4   image was not used in the sed fitting . see  [ sec:10.4 ] for a discussion on the change of the peak wavelength .",
    "the variables @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 were treated as free parameters for the fitting .",
    "color temperature @xmath19 represents the temperature of warm dust grains emitting the mir continuum ( see  [ sec : mircont ] for a discussion ) .",
    "the factor @xmath20 is a product of dust emissivity at 10   and beam filling factor of warm dust grains of @xmath19 . throughout this paper ,",
    "we call @xmath20 as `` emissivity ''",
    ". the mass of the warm dust grains per unit area can be estimated as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the absorption cross section per unit mass of dust grains .",
    "the dust model @xcite with @xmath24 tabulates the absorption cross section at 10   as @xmath25 .",
    "although the dust cloud might be clumpy , clumpiness does not affect the mass estimation when @xmath26 and a homogeneous temperature is assumed of warm dust that is emitting continuum .",
    "the other free parameter , @xmath21 , is the optical depth of the silicate feature at 9.7   towards the warm dust that is emitting continuum .",
    "a negative optical depth in our model represents emission of the silicate feature . although the spectral index of dust emissivity @xmath27 is usually uncertain ranging from 1 to 2 , we assumed @xmath28 following @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : mirtos ] shows spatial distributions of the parameters fitted on each pixel .",
    "the images were successfully fitted over a region of 50  pc to the north and 40  pc to the south from the central peak : uncertainty in fitted parameters are @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 . using the secondary reference star @xmath12  cma rather than @xmath12  ari , resulting t@xmath32 is within 1.5  k , @xmath21 becomes about 0.1 deeper , and @xmath20 becomes 10% stronger . to improve the signal - to - noise ratio of the parameters in the area surrounding the central peak ,",
    "the data were also fitted after being convolved to have 1.4 times wider fwhm .",
    "@xcite pointed out that ground based measurements of the silicate absorption feature at 9.7   might suffer from contamination in continuum with the unidentified infrared band ( uib ) emission at 7.7  .",
    "however , @xcite detected little emission of 7.7   uib towards ngc 1068 with _",
    "iso_-sws in the 14 @xmath13 27 aperture .",
    "the 3.3   uib feature is not seen in the spectrum obtained towards ngc 1068 by @xcite with the 38 aperture nor in the _",
    "l_-band spectra in this work .",
    "in fact , the uibs detected with isocam @xcite originate almost exclusively from the starburst regions , peaking at a distance of 1  kpc ( 14 ) from the central engine .",
    "they indicated that the agn contributes less than @xmath05% to the total integrated uib emission .",
    "therefore , we concluded that the contamination by the uibs to the continuum is negligible in our field of view of of @xmath0200  pc ( 27 ) around the central engine of ngc 1068 .",
    "high temperature areas seen 034 from the central engine on east and west sides coincide with the second and third diffraction rings ( 029 and 041 radius ) of the airy pattern at 8.8  . between these diffraction rings , there are also diffraction rings at longer wavelengths which might affect the fitting .",
    "nevertheless , a fitting on convolved airy images does not reproduce a peak in fitted temperature .",
    "therefore , we concluded that the high temperature region is not an artifact induced by the airy rings .",
    "flux was also spatially integrated over the area of each _",

    "the _ l_-band grism for 2.8    4.2   was used with the 03 slit , yielding the spectral resolution @xmath33 400 .",
    "the length of the slit was 18 .",
    "pixel scale was 0058 pixel@xmath2 .",
    "ngc 1068 was observed with the slit position angle ( p.a . ) of 3 from the north , with slit positioned at three positions to map the eastern area of the central peak : pointing offsets of @xmath346 along the slit and 028 and 056 to the east were applied .",
    "positions of the slits are illustrated in figure [ fig : mirtos]_a_. we call the slit at the central peak as `` c '' , and the slits in the east as `` 0.28e '' and `` 0.56e '' according to the offsets to the east in arcseconds .",
    "eight exposures of 2 seconds on - source integration time were obtained for each slit position .",
    "the sky condition was photometric throughout the observation .",

    "fielding , spectra of dawn sky were obtained at the end of the night .",
    "the _ l_-band data were reduced following the standard procedure : the 2-dimensional spectrograms were background subtracted by the dithering pairs , flat fielded , and corrected for bad pixels using iraf .",
    "subsequently , positional shifts of the spectrograms of each slit position were measured with cross correlations and confirmed to be not more than 0.2 pixels ( 0@xmath3601 or 3.2   ) in both the spatial and dispersion directions .",
    "the spectrograms were shifted in the dispersion direction on the 2-dimensional spectrograms to cancel wavelength shifts between the slit positions .",
    "flux of the spectrograms were then calibrated with the spectrum of the standard star bs 813 , which was assumed to have an effective temperature of 7244  k @xcite .",
    "wavelengths of the spectra were calibrated using cross - correlation with a model atmospheric transmittance @xcite .",
    "then , the spectra in slitlets of 015 along the slit were extracted to examine spatial variations .",

    "these wavelength ranges were chosen to avoid the 3.4   dust feature and the unstable continuum level at the both ends of the wavelength range due to changes of the atmospheric conditions . we assumed a dust emissivity index of @xmath43 for comparison of the parameters with those in the mir (  [ sec : mirfitting ] ) . spatial change of the color temperature in the _ l_-band along with those in mir are shown in figures [ fig : tback ] .",

    "[ fig : tback.prof ] , the measured @xmath19 in the mir scatters around the estimated equilibrium temperature .",
    "this implies that , as a whole , the mir emitting dust is mainly heated by the central engine and is in thermal equilibrium as has been suggested by @xcite .",

    "l_-band continuum exist in this area even if their column density is not as high as those emitting mir continuum .",
    "as @xcite and @xcite suggested , the uniformity of the color temperature can be explained as emission from vsgs , which emit continuum with color temperature higher than their equilibrium temperature due to thermal fluctuation upon absorption of uv photons @xcite .",
    "if the continuum is emitted by vsgs , the incident uv photon flux does not determine color temperature but determines brightness , or emissivity in our grey body model , of the continuum .",
    "we actually found the change of emissivity of the _ l_-band continuum upon incident uv photon flux from our grey body fittings , suggesting that the _ l_-band continuum is indeed emitted by vsgs .",

    "figure [ fig : tau ] shows that the silicate feature is observed as emission in the south .",
    "the emission of the silicate feature in the south of the central peak implies a temperature gradient in the line of sight : e.g. , an optically thin layer of warm dust is present in front of cooler continuum source . on the other hand , in the north",
    ", the change of the ratio @xmath67 may be explained either with a temperature gradient in the line of sight : warmer dust clouds are located behind cooler dust clouds , or with differences in dust composition .",
    "spatially resolved mir spectra are needed to disentangle the possibilities .      with the spatial resolution of 26  pc on the sky , the plausible dusty torus is not detected .",
    "instead , we found a pie shaped area of high mir emissivity in the north up to about 50  pc from the central engine ( figure [ fig : mirtos]_d _ ) .",
    "the pie shaped area is in the west of the radio jet .",
    "there is no other hint of a channel supplying material to the central engine in the ir images in the literature and in this study .",
    "therefore , we speculate that the area might be a channel that supplies material to the central engine .    the lifetime of this cloud can be estimated assuming that material falls down into the central engine through the cloud .",
    "the dust mass of the cloud is estimated at around @xmath68  m@xmath69 integrating @xmath70 over the cloud where @xmath71 and dividing with @xmath23 (  [ sec : mirfitting ] ) . assuming the dust - to - gas ratio of 100 @xcite , total mass of the cloud is @xmath72  m@xmath69",
    ". mass accretion rate to the central engine is estimated at 0.05  m@xmath69  year@xmath2 from total luminosity @xmath47 ( * ? ? ? * at luminosity distance of 15  mpc ) and a typical value of mass - to - luminosity conversion efficiency of a black hole @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "the estimated total mass and accretion rate yields a lifetime of the cloud to be on the order of 10@xmath74 years .",
    "we observed an area of 28 ( 200  pc ) around the central peak of ngc 1068 in the mir ( 8.8  12.3  ) and in the _",
    "l_-band ( 3.0  3.9  ) .",
    "the shifted - and - added mir images have a spatial resolution of 037 or a projected distance of 26  pc while the _ l_-band spectra are taken with a seeing limited spatial resolution of 03 or 22  pc . from these data , we derived grey body parameters : color temperatures of the continua and emissivities , which are proportional to column densities of dust emitting the continua , at each spatial element . moreover , optical depths of spectral features of silicate around 9.7   and carbonaceous dust around 3.4   were also derived (   [ sec : mirfitting ] , [ sec:3.4 ] ) .    the extended continua over 100  pc to the north and to the south of the central source are detected both in the mir and in the _ l_-band .",
    "we found that the mir continuum is mainly emitted from dust in thermal equilibrium with radiation from the central engine while the _ l_-band continuum is emitted by vsgs (  [ sec : background_source ] ) .",
    "the observed sed in the mir suggests that the peak wavelength of the 9.7   silicate absorption feature is shifted to a longer wavelength at some locations (  [ sec:10.4 ] ) .",
    "the ratio of the optical depths of the silicate and carbonaceous dust features show complicated spatial distribution (  [ sec : dust ] ) .",
    "there is a pie shaped area of enhanced mir emissivity extending about 50  pc to the north from the central engine .",
    "the morphology of the cloud leads us to speculate that the area is a channel that feeds material into the central engine (  [ sec : pie ] ) .",

    "<S> we studied the distribution of dust clouds around the central engine of ngc 1068 based on shifted - and - added 8.8  12.3   ( mir ) multi - filter images and 3.0  3.9   ( _ l_-band ) spectra obtained with the subaru telescope . in a region of 100  pc ( 14 ) around the central peak , we successfully constructed maps of color temperatures and emissivities of the mir and _ l_-band continua as well as the 9.7   and 3.4   dust features with spatial resolutions of 26  pc ( 037 ) in the mir and 22  pc ( 03 ) in the _ l_-band . </S>",
    "<S> our main results are : 1 ) color temperature of the mir continuum scatters around the thermal equilibrium temperature with the central engine as the heat source while that of the _ l_-band continuum is higher and independent upon distance from the central engine ; 2 ) the peak of the 9.7   silicate absorption feature is shifted to a longer wavelength at some locations ; 3 ) the ratio of the optical depths of the dust features is different from the galactic values and show complicated spatial distribution ; and 4 ) there is a pie shaped warm dust cloud as an enhancement in the emissivity of the mir continuum extending about 50  pc to the north from the central engine . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that material falls into the central engine through this cloud . </S>"
