    "the quantum system of interest interacts with its environment ( open quantum system ) and relaxes back to some equilibrium state @xcite .",
    "this relaxation effect leads to degraded signal recovery and , in turn , to the loss of experimental information .",
    "optimal manipulation of open quantum systems in such a way as to produce desired evolutions while minimizing relaxation losses has been a long - standing and challenging problem in the area of quantum control .",
    "various methods employing optimization techniques and principles of optimal control have been developed for the design of pulse sequences that can be used to manipulate quantum systems in an optimal manner .",
    "however , the large majority of them is limited to deal with closed quantum systems @xcite .",
    "recently , relaxation - optimized pulse sequences that maximize the performance of open quantum systems have emerged . in some simple cases , for example maximizing polarization transfer between a pair of coupled spins in the presence of relaxation ,",
    "the optimal pulses have been derived analytically using optimal control theory @xcite . for more general cases ,",
    "gradient ascent algorithms were proposed to optimize pulse sequences for optimally steering the dynamics of coupled nuclear spins @xcite .",
    "these algorithms , while successful , rely heavily on the computation of an analytic expression for the system evolution propagator and gradients as well as a large number of discretizations over which to evolve the system .",
    "this results in expensive computational power , and gradient ascent algorithms in general inherit slow linear convergence rates @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we present a unified computational method for optimal pulse sequence design based on pseudospectral approximations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we formulate optimal control problems in open quantum systems and introduce pseudospectral methods . in section",
    "[ sec : example ] , we present several examples to demonstrate the robustness of pseudospectral methods for optimal pulse sequence design .",
    "the systems in the examples have been thoroughly studied in our previous work or by others .",
    "for an open quantum system , the evolution of its density matrix is not unitary . in many applications of interest",
    ", the environment can be approximated as an infinite thermostat the state of which never changes . under this assumption , so - called the markovian approximation , it is possible to write the evolution of the density matrix of an open system ( master equation ) alone in the lindblad form @xcite @xmath0-l(\\rho)\\ , \\qquad ( \\hbar=1)\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the system hamiltonian that generates unitary evolution while the term @xmath2 models relaxation ( nonunitary dynamics ) .",

    "the hamiltonian @xmath1 has the general form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the free evolution hamiltonian and @xmath9 is the so - called control hamiltonian .",
    "the later is used to manipulate the open quantum system by application of electromagnetic pulses @xmath10 of appropriate shape and frequency .",
    "a typical problem of controlling an ( finite - dimensional ) open quantum system has the following form : starting from some initial state @xmath11 at @xmath12 , find optimal pulses @xmath10 , @xmath13 , that bring the final density matrix @xmath14 at @xmath15 as `` close '' as possible to some target operator @xmath16 .",
    "more precisely , find @xmath10 that maximize the final expectation value of @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "using the master equation ( [ ro ] ) and the relation @xmath18 that holds for a time - independent operator , we can find a system of ordinary differential equations that describe the time evolution of an open system for the desired transfer @xmath19 @xcite @xmath20x\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the state vector whose elements are expectation values of the operators participating in the transfer ( for example usually @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 are square matrices corresponding to operators @xmath24 under a fixed basis of the state space ( hilbert space ) and @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "this gives rise to an optimal control problem that starting from an initial state @xmath26 ( which is related to @xmath11 ) , find the controls @xmath10 , @xmath25 $ ] , that maximize @xmath27 subject to the system evolution equations as in ( [ bilinear ] ) .",
    "specific examples are given in the next section .",
    "practical considerations such as power and time constraints guide us to consider a more general cost function ( the quantity that we want to maximize or minimize ) @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the control vector , @xmath30 is the terminal cost depending on the final state at the terminal time @xmath15 , and @xmath31 is the running cost depending on the time history of the state and control variables , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "for example , if @xmath34 and @xmath35 , then ( [ cost ] ) is equivalent to maximizing @xmath36 as mentioned above , while if @xmath37 and @xmath38 , then ( [ cost ] ) is equivalent to minimizing the energy of the pulses . in many cases of application ,",
    "not only the initial state @xmath26 can be specified but also other endpoint constraints may be imposed .",
    "they can be expressed in a compact form as @xmath39 additionally , constraints on the state and control variables satisfied along the path of the system may be imposed , such as the amplitude constraints where @xmath40 , for all @xmath41 $ ] , where @xmath42 is the maximum amplitude of the pulses .",
    "such constraints can be expressed as @xmath43 this class of optimal control problems of bilinear systems ( linear in both state and control ) described in are in general analytically intractable .",
    "however , they can be efficiently solved by pseudospectral methods .",
    "spectral methods involve the expansion of functions in terms of orthogonal polynomial basis functions on the domain @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "using such a basis leads to _ spectral accuracy _",
    ", namely , the @xmath45 coefficient of the expansion decays faster than any inverse power of @xmath46 @xcite , which is analogous to the fourier series expansion for periodic functions .",
    "this property of rapid decay from spectral methods is adapted to solve optimal control problems like the one described above .",
    "it permits the use of relatively low order polynomials to approximate the control and state trajectory functions , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "since the support of the orthogonal polynomial bases is on the interval @xmath44 $ ] , we first transform the optimal control problem from the time domain @xmath25 $ ] to @xmath49 $ ] using the simple affine transformation , @xmath50 in a redundant use of notation , we make this transition and reuse the same time variable @xmath51 .",

    "pseudospectral approximations are a spectral collocation ( or interpolation ) method in which the differential equation describing the state dynamics is enforced at specific nodes .",
    "spectral collocation is motivated by the chebyshev equioscillation theorem @xcite which states that the best @xmath53 order approximating polynomial @xmath54 to a continuous function @xmath55 on the interval @xmath44 $ ] is an interpolating polynomial , as evaluated by the uniform norm , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the space of all polynomials of degree at most n. since any @xmath53 order interpolating polynomial can be represented in terms of the lagrange basis functions ( or lagrange polynomials ) , we use these functions to express the interpolating approximations of the continuous state and control functions , @xmath48 and @xmath47 , as in the model . given a grid of @xmath58 interpolation nodes within",
    "@xmath44 $ ] , @xmath59 , the lagrange polynomials @xmath60 , @xmath61 , are constructed by @xmath62 which are characterized by the @xmath45 polynomial taking unit value at the @xmath45 node of the grid and zero value at all other nodes of the grid , i.e. , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the kronecker delta function @xcite .",
    "note that lagrange polynomials form an orthogonal basis with respect to the discrete inner product @xmath65 .    with these tools",
    ", we can now write the @xmath53 order interpolating approximations of the state trajectory and control functions with respect to a given grid @xmath66 of @xmath58 nodes as , @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are not only the coefficients of the expansions , but also the function values at the @xmath45 node due to the definition of the lagrange polynomials @xcite .",
    "because these lagrange polynomials are constructed based on the choice of these nodes , the approximations made with this basis as in and are sensitive to the choice of the nodes . for an arbitrary selection of nodes , as the order of approximation @xmath70 gets large , runge phenomenon may occur , that is , there are increasingly larger spurious oscillations near the endpoints of the @xmath44 $ ] domain @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : uniform_lgl ] .",
    "a selection of gauss - type nodes with quadratic spacing towards the endpoints suppresses such oscillation between the interpolation nodes and greatly increases the accuracy of the approximation @xcite .",

    "in this paper , we presented a method based on pseudospectral approximations to effectively discretize and solve optimal control problems associated with pulse sequence design for open quantum mechanical systems .",
    "examples from nmr spectroscopy in liquid solutions evidenced the flexibility and efficiency of the proposed methods . in these examples ,",
    "pseudospectral methods generated pulses that achieve performance similar to that of analytical methods , and it should be noted that these `` approximated '' optimal pulses found by pseudospectral methods are always smooth .",
    "a strength of pseudospectral methods is that they provide a robust technique which is easily extendible and implementable .",
    "in addition , it has been shown empirically that these methods have exponential convergence rates @xcite , while state - of - the - art algorithms like gradient methods typically evidence linear convergence .",
    "pseudospectral methods provide a universal tool for solving pulse design problems for dissipative quantum systems coming from different physical contexts ( nmr , mri , quantum optics etc ) .",
    "some immediate extensions of the methods presented here include considering the optimal pulse design problem of steering a family of open or closed quantum systems with different dynamics .",
    "a concrete example is to consider a family of coupled spin systems where each one is characterized by a different relaxation rate , e.g. , @xmath72 can take values from a positive interval @xmath73 $ ] . in this case , the optimal control problem would seek to accomplish the maximum transfer , @xmath74 , over all systems , namely , to maximize @xmath75 subject to the system evolution as in , , or .",
