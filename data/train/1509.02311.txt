    "compared to three dimensions , the statistical mechanics of one - dimensional ( 1d ) fluids is both simpler and harder .",
    "simpler , because a general result due to van hove  @xcite excludes the possibility of distinct phases in one - dimensional , homogeneous , and one - component classical fluids of hard particles with short - range interactions .",
    "also more complicated , however , because whenever any of the hypotheses behind van hove s theorem is not met , it may be extremely difficult to say whether or not the given 1d interaction would admit a genuine phase transition ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs.@xcite ) .    in this respect ,",
    "the class of potentials known as generalized - exponential models ( gem ) is emblematic .",
    "these are classical fluids of particles repelling each other through a potential of the form @xmath0 ( gem-@xmath1 potential ) , where @xmath2 are arbitrary energy and length units , @xmath3 is the interparticle distance , and @xmath4 is a real positive index .",
    "the gem potentials stay finite at the origin , hence particles may fully overlap , in strike contrast to real atoms and molecules .",
    "clearly , bounded potentials only make sense as models of the _ effective _ pair interaction between large molecular aggregates that can intertwine even to the extent that their centers of mass exactly coincide . in three dimensions",
    "bounded interactions give rise to structural patterns which are unknown to rare - gas fluids , notably reentrant melting and waterlike anomalies , which have been the subject of numerous investigations in the last few decades ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite , to name but a few ) .",
    "a particularly curious feature of bounded two - body repulsions is the possibility to generate stable _ _",
    "cluster crystals__@xcite , _ i.e. _ , crystalline phases involving a mean number of particles per lattice site larger than 1 , which have been extensively studied in the recent past@xcite .    when confined in one dimension , penetrable particles may pass one through the other , thus making it possible to change the particle ordering within the line .",
    "while there exists a general method of computing the exact thermodynamics of a specific class of 1d systems of impenetrable particles@xcite , nothing can _ a priori _ be said about the phase behavior of freely overlapping particles . hence ,",
    "either a brute - force numerical - simulation approach is taken or some other plausibility arguments must be used to probe the existence of separate phases in such 1d systems .    in ref.@xcite , the 1d gem-2 ( that is , the one - dimensional counterpart of the gaussian - core model@xcite ) was studied by monte carlo ( mc ) simulation .",
    "no phase transition was found , even at zero temperature ( @xmath5 ) , notwithstanding the system structure at low temperature is crystal - like and clear signs of dimerization were found at high pressure .",
    "for the 1d gem-4 the situation is markedly different@xcite .",
    "true phase transitions exist at @xmath5 between states allowing for an increasing number of particles in the same lattice site . in simulation ,",
    "these states gave rise to clear - cut cluster phases for @xmath6 , with sharp boundaries which manifest themselves through hysteresis loops in the number density as a function of pressure .",
    "in fact , the coexistence loci are so sharp that they could be traced by free - energy calculations . however , when mc simulations were made much longer ( up to tens of million sweeps ) , hysteresis loops became narrower and the alleged critical points shifted to low temperatures , thus raising doubts on the true nature of the crossover from one phase to the other . therefore , it is still unclear whether proper phase transitions truly exist or not in the 1d gem-4 .    in the present paper",
    ", we address this problem from the different perspective of theoretical modeling . upon building up successive , increasingly accurate approximations to the 1d gem-@xmath1 system for @xmath7 , we compute the density as a function of pressure for fixed temperature , seeking for jumps or other singularities . at the end",
    ", we get a more definite idea about the nature of phase crossovers in gem fluids . even though not having the same degree of certainty as a mathematical proof , nonetheless the present work sheds fresh light on a still open question .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . after introducing a coarse - grained formulation of the 1d gem-@xmath1 hamiltonian in terms of interacting clusters on a lattice ,",
    "we compute the phase boundaries of the model first in the mean - field approximation ( section ii ) , and then by the exact transfer - matrix method ( section iii ) .",
    "going back to the continuum , in section iv we analyze the exact behavior of a system of point clusters moving on a line and discuss its relevance for the phase behavior of the original gem system .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in the last section .",
    "the statistical mechanics of the 1d gem-@xmath1 system is not amenable to an exact analytical treatment .",
    "however , some progress can be made by analyzing a related system which allows to simplify the counting of states . in this regard , a crucial observation from the simulation  @xcite is that the low - temperature structure of the gem fluid away from the alleged transition points  is not dissimilar from an ordered cluster crystal , with average site occupancy and lattice spacing depending on temperature @xmath8 and number density @xmath9 in a smooth way . at a phase transition , the average occupancy increases by one and the density undergoes a sharp variation ( however , close to a transition point clusters do not necessarily contain the same number of particles and the separation between two adjacent clusters may then vary along the line ) . given the above evidence",
    ", we are led to represent the low - temperature behavior of the 1d gem-@xmath1 system of @xmath10 particles in a volume @xmath11 by means of the coarse - grained lattice model of hamiltonian : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the ( for the moment arbitrary ) number of point - like clusters ( one for each lattice site ) , @xmath14 is the lattice spacing , _ i.e. _ , the distance between nearest - neighbor ( nn ) clusters , and @xmath15 is the size of the cluster residing at @xmath16 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the number of particles located at the fixed lattice positions @xmath17 on the right - hand side of eq.([2 - 1 ] ) , the first term is the intra - cluster energy while the second term represents the total interaction energy of particles belonging to different clusters ( periodic boundary conditions are implied ) .",
    "observe that the inter - cluster potential in eq.([2 - 1 ] ) is not restricted to nearest - neighbors , but involves arbitrarily distant clusters . a model similar to ( [ 2 - 1 ] )",
    "has already been considered by wilding and sollich  @xcite as a tool to investigate the @xmath5 transitions of the three - dimensional gem-@xmath4 system . in this section",
    "we extend their mean - field treatment to @xmath6 for the 1d case , while deferring the exact analysis of model ( [ 2 - 1 ] ) to the next section .    in order to extract the thermodynamic properties of ( [ 2 - 1 ] )",
    "we first use the variational principle of statistical mechanics .",
    "since handling the @xmath18 constraint is hard , we shall work in the grand - canonical ensemble where @xmath19 , and the chemical potential @xmath20 are fixed , while each @xmath21 can assume every value between 1 and @xmath22 . in this ensemble",
    "the gibbs - bogoliubov inequality prescribes that the grand potential @xmath23 is bounded from above by a functional @xmath24 , @xmath25\\equiv\\mathrm{tr}\\left[\\pi(h+\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\ln\\pi-\\mu n)\\right]\\equiv e^*-ts^*-\\mu n^*\\ , , \\label{2 - 3}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is any trial probability density in state space and @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath24 reaches its minimum for @xmath28 ( _ i.e. _ , the equilibrium grand - canonical density ) , where it takes the value @xmath23 .",
    "once a parametric form of @xmath26 is chosen , minimizing @xmath29 $ ] with respect to parameters is the way to make the best possible estimate of @xmath23 .",
    "a system with no specific constraint on the total number of lattice sites entails a complication .",
    "in fact , after computing @xmath30 ( _ i.e. _ , the least upper bound to @xmath23 ) for each @xmath13 , we still need to optimize with respect to @xmath13 .",
    "this is done according to the criterion stated by swope and andersen  @xcite , that is by minimizing @xmath31 with respect to @xmath14 , or , equivalently , with respect to the @xmath13-dependent density @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "the simplest choice is a @xmath33 of uncorrelated @xmath34 variables .",
    "following ref.@xcite , we choose @xmath35 ( _ i.e. _ , the mean site occupancy ) as the only parameter in @xmath36 . at low temperature , we are allowed to assume that only two @xmath34 values at a time may occur in the system , namely @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "hence we have : @xmath39 the value of @xmath40 is determined by the condition @xmath41 . since @xmath42",
    "we get @xmath43 , which also yields : @xmath44 from the very definition of @xmath45 it follows that @xmath46 , hence @xmath47 putting all things together we obtain : @xmath48 \\epsilon + 2\\overline{n}^{2}\\left [ u\\left(\\frac{\\overline{n}}{d}\\right ) + u\\left ( \\frac{2\\overline{n}}{d}\\right)+\\ldots \\right ] \\right\\ } \\ , ; \\notag \\\\ -ts^{\\ast } & = & k_{\\mathrm{b}}t\\frac{ld}{\\overline{n}}\\left [ ( 1-\\delta ) \\ln(1-\\delta ) + \\delta \\ln \\delta \\right ] \\ , ; \\notag \\\\ -\\mu n^{\\ast } & = & -\\mu ld\\ , , \\label{2 - 8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the system pressure @xmath49 is then given by : @xmath50 any jump in the equilibrium number density @xmath51 as a function of @xmath20 at constant @xmath8 will be the hallmark of a first - order transition .    in figs.1 and 2",
    "we have plotted our mean - field results for the 1d gem-4 system relative to six isothermal paths , @xmath52 ( from now on , all quantities will be given in the units set by @xmath53 , and @xmath54 ) . for these temperatures we first computed the best value of @xmath35 and the corresponding value @xmath55 of @xmath56 as a function of @xmath57 ( top panel of fig.1 ) .",
    "the optimal @xmath35 undergoes a steady increase with @xmath57 , interrupted at regular intervals by plateaus at integer heights . within the same @xmath57 ranges where @xmath35 stays constant ,",
    "@xmath55 is convex upward .",
    "the bottom panel of fig.1 shows the lattice spacing @xmath58 as a function of @xmath57 ; @xmath59 exhibits a zig - zag pattern which gradually dampens as @xmath57 grows .",
    "observe that the value of @xmath59 never falls below @xmath60 , meaning that the distance between two next - nearest - neighbor clusters is always larger than @xmath61 .",
    "since @xmath62 , this means that the gem-4 interactions are effectively limited to nearest neighbors only ( the same applies for any @xmath63 ) . in fig.2",
    "we show @xmath9 ( top panel ) and @xmath64 ( bottom panel ) as a function of @xmath49 for the same temperatures considered in fig.1 .",
    "the density jumps at the lowest temperatures indicate a sequence of first - order transitions between cluster phases of increasing occupancy . above @xmath65",
    "all discontinuities vanish and the transitions are replaced by smooth crossovers .    summing up , our mean - field theory asserts the existence of low - temperature phase transitions in the 1d gem-4 system .",
    "compared to the work by wilding and sollich@xcite , two important improvements are : 1 ) our theory is directly derived from the variational principle of statistical mechanics and , as such , it can be systematically improved ; 2 ) at variance with the theory in ref.@xcite , to which ours reduces for @xmath5 , the present mean - field theory also applies for @xmath6 .",
    "since the results of an approximate theory may not be conclusive , the accuracy of our mean - field theory for 1d gem-@xmath1 systems will now be tested against an exact treatment of model ( [ 2 - 1 ] ) .",
    "we start by rewriting the latter hamiltonian as : @xmath66 which assumes zero interaction beyond nearest neighbors ( we shall check _ a posteriori _ that , for @xmath67 , the omitted terms are actually ineffective at all temperatures of interest ) .",
    "again , the clusters are fixed at the lattice positions given by eq.([2 - 2 ] ) , and @xmath14 is an adjustable parameter to be eventually optimized by requiring the system pressure to be maximum .",
    "each @xmath13-uple of @xmath34 values ( for @xmath68 ) represents an individual state of the model ( [ 3 - 1 ] ) , since the particles building up the clusters are indistinguishable .",
    "canonical _ partition function would be the sum of the boltzmann factors over all @xmath13-uples @xmath69 of positive integers obeying the constraint @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , as in the previous section , the calculation is most easily performed in the grand - canonical ensemble , since the partition function of the latter involves an unconstrained sum over @xmath71 .",
    "using the transfer - matrix method , the grand potential ( under periodic boundary conditions ) reads @xmath72 where the last step holds for large @xmath13 ( and @xmath11 ) values . in the above equation ,",
    "@xmath73 is the largest eigenvalue of the ( symmetric ) transfer matrix @xmath74 it is worth stressing that the thermodynamic limit implies taking not only @xmath75 but also @xmath76 , in such a way that @xmath77 remains finite .",
    "also observe that @xmath78 is an infinite matrix , since both @xmath79 and @xmath80 can vary between 1 and @xmath81 . in practice ,",
    "if the system density is not too high , we can assume @xmath79 and @xmath80 in eq.([3 - 3 ] ) to vary between , say , 1 and 10 ( @xmath78 thus becomes a @xmath82 matrix ) .",
    "the calculation of @xmath73 was carried out numerically by the power method  @xcite .",
    "first the system pressure for every @xmath59 was computed through @xmath83 , yielding in the thermodynamic limit : @xmath84 such a quantity was then maximized to get the equilibrium pressure : @xmath85 a first - order phase transition occurs whenever the @xmath86 vs. @xmath59 profile exhibits two different maxima , whose relative stability changes when crossing a specific @xmath20 value .",
    "this implies a jump discontinuity in the optimal value of @xmath59 , which in turn produces a jump in the density as a function of @xmath64 or @xmath49 .",
    "we first computed @xmath49 for @xmath87 , finding values very close to those given by mean - field theory ( pressure differences in reduced units were typically smaller than @xmath88 ) ; only for the smallest @xmath8 the numerical calculation of the pressure could not be carried out above a certain @xmath64 , because of the huge values of some @xmath78 components .",
    "we verified that , even including second - neighbor terms in the hamiltonian , the pressure does not change appreciably for @xmath67 .",
    "the reason is the same mentioned previously : the optimal @xmath59 values are never smaller than @xmath89 , hence the strength of the second - neighbor repulsions is nearly zero . in fig.3",
    "we show our exact transfer - matrix results for the lattice model ( [ 3 - 1 ] ) .",
    "besides @xmath59 , the top panel of fig.3 also reports the connected correlation between nn clusters , @xmath90 , and the correlation length @xmath91 defined by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the second ( next to the leading ) eigenvalue of @xmath78 in descending order .",
    "while @xmath93 was computed by wielandt deflation  @xcite , the nn correlation was determined by the formula : @xmath94 where the @xmath95 matrix has the @xmath78 eigenvectors for columns ( in descending order of eigenvalue ) .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath96 , which is very small for all pressures , may explain the good quality of our mean - field theory .",
    "the bottom panel of fig.3 reports the average occupancy @xmath97 , the average squared occupancy @xmath98 , and the density @xmath99 , respectively computed by the formulas : @xmath100 overall , the density behavior closely resembles that found in mean - field theory .",
    "indeed , we see again discontinuous jumps at the lowest temperatures ( @xmath101 ) , indicating true first - order phase transitions . at higher temperatures , the discontinuous jumps",
    "transform into sharp , but continuous , density changes in a very narrow range of pressures ( similar trends were named _",
    "pseudo - transitions _ in a different 1d model by pkalski _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the correlation length shows a distinct maximum near each low - temperature transition point . as @xmath8 grows from 0 , these maxima first increase and then",
    ", past @xmath102 , start to decrease , suggesting that each coexistence line ends with a critical point and that @xmath91 diverges at a critical temperature @xmath103 . since the transfer matrix @xmath78 is strictly positive for any @xmath8",
    ", one might argue that its maximum eigenvalue is necessarily simple ( by perron - frobenius theorem  @xcite ) , and therefore it would be safely excluded that @xmath91 may ever diverge .",
    "however , as already noted , the true transfer matrix is infinite and therefore the use of the perron - frobenius theorem is not legitimate  @xcite .",
    "hence , the question of the behavior of @xmath91 near @xmath102 can only be answered numerically ( see below ) .    upon looking more deeply into the density and correlation - length profiles close to every zero - temperature transition point",
    ", we observed a very complex behavior . in figs.4 and 5",
    "we focus on the transition from the 1-cluster phase ( 1 ) to the 2-cluster phase ( 2 ) .",
    "the density jump at the transition has an irregular @xmath8 behavior . upon heating from @xmath5 , the 1 - 2 coexistence line bifurcates  at @xmath104 .",
    "indeed , two distinct density jumps are seen for @xmath105 ( red curves in figs.4 and 5 ) , and this entails the existence of a third phase , intermediate between 1 and 2 , characterized by values of @xmath106 .",
    "however , this extra - phase has a very precarious existence , since it has already disappeared for @xmath107 .",
    "eventually , above @xmath108 we find no density jump but a continuous density curve , and the 1 - 2 coexistence line terminates .",
    "figure 5 shows that the correlation length never diverges and that the widom line ( _ i.e. _ , the locus of regular @xmath91 maxima ) , rather than departing from the ending point of the coexistence line , actually blossoms from the coexistence line near @xmath105 .",
    "we finally notice that the behavior of @xmath9 and @xmath91 near the 2 - 3 and 3 - 4 transitions is perfectly analogous to that described for the 1 - 2 transition .",
    "figures 6 and 7 report the overall phase diagram on the @xmath49-@xmath8 and @xmath9-@xmath8 plane , respectively . on each coexistence line",
    "there is a bifurcation point and the widom line apparently emerges from it .",
    "the mean - field coexistence lines are also shown .",
    "they run extremely close to the exact loci up to the bifurcation points , while progressively departing from them for higher temperatures .",
    "finally , we looked at what happens when increasing @xmath4 from 4 .",
    "we found that the discontinuous density jumps are only present in a smaller and smaller range of low temperatures until they altogether disappear for all @xmath6 when @xmath109 . in this limit , @xmath110 coincides with @xmath99 ( see fig.8 ) .",
    "hence , the 1d penetrable - sphere model ( psm , corresponding to the @xmath109 limit of gem-@xmath4 ) would show no phase transition at @xmath6 .",
    "we hereafter show that in hamiltonian ( [ 3 - 1 ] ) the lattice constraint ( [ 2 - 2 ] ) can be weakened , making the distance between clusters partly arbitrary , and the model still remains _ exactly _ solvable .    in the previous section , we considered a model whose states",
    "are represented by @xmath13-uples of positive @xmath34 integers , defined at fixed lattice positions @xmath111 . slightly abusing the notation ,",
    "a model state was any vector @xmath112 , with @xmath111 defined by eq.([2 - 2 ] ) .",
    "we now release the constraint on the cluster positions and let @xmath111 be any real number in the interval @xmath113 $ ] .",
    "we focus on the specific order @xmath114 , which is one out of the @xmath115 possible orderings of coordinates .",
    "therefore , a microstate of the by - now continuum model is going to be represented by a @xmath116-uple @xmath117 , with @xmath118 .",
    "since the clusters are now free to move , the new hamiltonian is written as : @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the momentum and mass of the @xmath16-th cluster , respectively ( @xmath122 being the mass of an individual particle ) . in the interaction term , which is again _",
    "limited to nearest - neighbors _ , the potential @xmath123 differs from @xmath124 for the addition of a suitable hard core of diameter @xmath125 .",
    "we need such a modification to ensure that , for the given @xmath124 potential , a cluster effectively interacts only with its first neighbors ; under this assumption , the calculation of the partition function becomes feasible by elementary methods , as we shall see below .",
    "admitting only nn interactions in eq.([4 - 1 ] ) actually amounts to cut the @xmath124 interaction at @xmath126 . for the gem-@xmath1 potential with @xmath127 ,",
    "this is clearly allowed for @xmath128 , but we can take an even smaller @xmath125 if , in the system configurations with highest boltzmann s weight under the given thermodynamic conditions , the number of second - neighbor clusters at distance @xmath129 is statistically irrelevant ( as occurs in gem-@xmath4 systems , with @xmath130 or higher , for low temperatures ) .",
    "in other words , replacing @xmath124 with @xmath123 would not alter the statistical properties of the gem-@xmath1 model , in so far as the most relevant configurations of model ( [ 4 - 1 ] ) are those where the distance between nn clusters is around @xmath131 .    for reasons which will be apparent below",
    ", it is far easier to compute the partition function of model ( [ 4 - 1 ] ) in an ensemble where the independent variables are @xmath132 .",
    "observe that @xmath133 do not exhaust the set of intensive variables for our system since @xmath134 , the chemical potential conjugate to @xmath13 , is also intensive . denoting @xmath135 the partition function in the @xmath136 representation ,",
    "the appropriate thermodynamic potential is @xmath137 however , thermodynamic equilibrium requires that @xmath138 must be identically zero@xcite and @xmath139 then vanishes exactly .",
    "it is worth stressing that the equilibrium condition @xmath140 represents itself an implicit functional relation between @xmath141 and @xmath20 , and we will exploit it to express , _ e.g. _ , @xmath64 as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath49 .    statistical mechanics allows to compute @xmath135 from the hamiltonian .",
    "all details of such a calculation are given in the appendix .",
    "the main result is that , similarly to the treatment of section iii , also @xmath142 can be expressed in terms of a transfer matrix @xmath78 ( defined at eq([a-4 ] ) ) . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", @xmath135 reduces to @xmath143 where @xmath73 is the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath78 ( and the other , less important , symbols are defined in the appendix ) .",
    "substitution of this result into eq.([4 - 2 ] ) then yields @xmath144 and from eq.([4 - 3 ] ) we can conclude that @xmath145 we have thus demonstrated that the equilibrium condition based upon the chemical potential , @xmath146 , is perfectly equivalent to the condition @xmath147 for the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix @xmath78 .    before going on , it is worth remarking that the same eq.([4 - 6 ] ) can also be obtained by a different route , which is reminiscent of the treatment of 1d multi - component mixtures by longuet - higgins@xcite . in this case , let us start from the grand - canonical partition function @xmath148 , defined as @xmath149 assuming @xmath146 from the outset , the partition function actually reads : @xmath150 for any number @xmath151 , let us consider the integral : @xmath152 denoting @xmath153 the yet unknown system pressure in terms of @xmath8 and @xmath20 , and observing that @xmath154 , it follows for any @xmath155 that : @xmath156}\\ , .",
    "\\label{4 - 10}\\ ] ] on the other hand , by the same steps leading to eq.([4 - 4 ] ) the integral in eq.([4 - 10 ] ) can also be more cumbersomely written as : @xmath157 @xmath158 being the set of ( real ) @xmath78 eigenvalues listed in decreasing order ( notice that all @xmath159 are in modulus less than 1 for @xmath160 , since otherwise one of the series in eq.([4 - 11 ] ) would not converge , contrary to what implied by eq.([4 - 10 ] ) ) .",
    "comparing the last two equations , we see that when @xmath151 attains the value @xmath153 the largest eigenvalue @xmath161 becomes equal to 1 , meaning that @xmath162 is implicitly defined by eq.([4 - 6 ] ) .",
    "clearly , the just stated condition would make the thermal properties of the model depend on the exact value of @xmath163 , a quantity which sets the value of @xmath164 relative to @xmath54 ( see eq.([a-4 ] ) ) .",
    "we suspect that this annoying feature of model ( 4.1 ) is the price to pay for clusters to be considered as point - like particles . in the following ,",
    "we take the pragmatic view to choose the @xmath165 value which produces the best possible agreement with existing mc simulation data for the 1d gem-4 system .    for @xmath130",
    ", we computed @xmath64 and @xmath166 as a function of @xmath49 in the interval 0.75 - 0.9 , corresponding to the 1 - 2 transition region , for a number of temperatures between @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "as a preliminary check , we verified that the @xmath9 values are relatively insensitive to @xmath125 : with either @xmath169 or @xmath170 the results were practically the same , suggesting that the distance between nn clusters never falls below 1 in the configurations with the highest statistical weight .",
    "this result is very important , since it is then immaterial which potential , either the original @xmath124 or @xmath123 ( for @xmath171 and nn interactions only ) , is used for describing the properties of the gem-4  @xcite .",
    "our results are plotted in fig.9 ( top panel ) , for @xmath172 and @xmath170 . upon comparing the present results with mc density data for @xmath173  @xcite",
    ", we see that the improvement of the continuum model ( [ 4 - 1 ] ) over the lattice model of sect.iii is dramatic ( a few @xmath99 curves for the lattice model were reproduced for convenience in the lower panel of fig.9 ) .",
    "in fact , there is a slight dependence of the location of the 1 - 2 transition on @xmath165 ( all density curves are rigidly shifted to the right as @xmath165 is reduced ) , but this effect is smaller for the lower temperatures and actually negligible near @xmath5 .",
    "however , the crucial point is that , compared to the lattice model of sect.iii , the scenario set by the continuum model is qualitatively different : _ the 1 - 2 transition , which for low @xmath8 is discontinuous in the lattice model , is now turned into a smooth crossover_. this conclusion is consistent with heuristic arguments forbidding any sort of spontaneous symmetry breaking in one dimension  @xcite .",
    "one might observe that this outcome does not come as a surprise , and could have been anticipated from the very beginning , since endowing the interaction potential with a hard core restores the validity of van hove s theorem .",
    "although correct , however , in no way this reasoning diminishes the virtue of a model whose surprising effectiveness , along with the insensitivity of density curves to @xmath125 , make us believe that it is indeed capturing the very essence of the 1d gem-4 system .    the noteworthy efficacy of the continuum model would cast a shadow on the relevance of the lattice model for the behavior of 1d gem-4 .",
    "in other words , the phase transitions discussed in sect.ii and iii now appear to be an artifice of assuming a strict crystal structure for an originally continuous system of low dimensionality . nor the simulation results of ref .",
    "@xcite can be taken in support of first - order transition behavior .",
    "in fact , the density hysteresis loops observed in the simulations appeared to progressively narrow as the mc trajectories became longer and longer , thus rendering those numerical results actually inconclusive .",
    "particles interacting through pairwise repulsions bounded at the origin are known to exhibit unconventional thermodynamic and structural behavior , such as reentrant melting , waterlike anomalies , and cluster crystals .",
    "which features are observed in a given case crucially depends on the range of the interaction and the space dimensionality .    in three dimensions ,",
    "the generalized exponential model of index @xmath1 ( gem-@xmath1 ) shows reentrant melting for @xmath174 , whereas it gives rise to a sequence of stable cluster - crystal phases for any @xmath175 . in this paper , we have studied the phase behavior of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) gem-@xmath1 systems by theoretical means , focusing on the @xmath130 case where numerical - simulation results are available@xcite .",
    "mc simulations gave contrasting indications : on the one hand , the low - temperature hysteretic behavior of the number density points to the existence of low - temperature first - order transitions between cluster phases ; on the other hand , the systematic narrowing of hysteresis loops , as simulations were made longer and longer , suggests that the apparently singular behavior of the 1d gem-4 system is actually a finite - size , finite - time artifact .",
    "to clarify the situation , we introduced both a lattice and a continuum cluster model aimed at specifically representing the low - temperature behavior of the original gem system .",
    "while the lattice system exhibited a sequence of low - temperature first - order transitions between cluster phases of increasing occupancy , as evidenced by the discontinuous jumps of the number density as a function of pressure , the more accurate model defined on the continuum only showed a series of smooth crossovers between cluster `` phases '' devoid of separate individuality . when comparing the results for the continuum cluster model with mc simulation data for @xmath176 we found a rather good agreement , thus indicating that strict phase boundaries are likely absent in the 1d gem-4 system , and even more so in the 1d gem-@xmath4 with @xmath177 .",
