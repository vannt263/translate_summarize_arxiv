    "d.   @xmath78 is continuous from the right at 0 .",
    "it follows that @xmath78 must be continuous everywhere on @xmath83 . using the modulus function , maddox @xcite@xcite introduced the generalizations of the classical spaces of strongly summable sequences by defining certain sequence spaces using a modulus function @xmath78 .",
