    "problem ( [ eq : pde])-([def : reaction ] ) is a generalization of the cross - diffusion model introduced by busenberg and travis @xcite and gurtin and pipkin @xcite to take into account the effect of over - crowding repulsion on the population dynamics , see @xcite for the modelling details .    under the main condition @xmath11 for some positive constant @xmath12 ,",
    "it was proven in @xcite the existence of weak solutions for rather general conditions on the data problem .",
    "notice that ( [ h : def_pos ] ) implies the following ellipticity condition on the matrix @xmath13 : @xmath14 this condition allows us to , through a procedure of approximation , justify the use of @xmath15 as a test function in the weak formulation of ( [ eq : pde])-([eq : id ] ) .",
    "then we get , for the entropy functional @xmath16 the identity @xmath17 from ( [ h : def_pos ] ) and other minor assumptions one then obtains the entropy inequality @xmath18 providing the key @xmath19 estimate of @xmath20 and @xmath21 which allows to prove the existence of weak solutions .",
    "however , it was also proven in @xcite that condition ( [ h : def_pos ] ) is just a sufficient condition , and that solutions may exist for the case of semi - definite positive matrix @xmath22 .    a particular important case captured by problem ( [ eq : pde])-([def : reaction ] )",
    "is the _ contact inhibition problem _ , arising in tumor modeling , see for instance chaplain et al .",
    "@xcite . in this case ,",
    "matrix @xmath22 is semi - definite positive , and the initial data , describing the spatial distribution of normal and tumor tissue , satisfy @xmath23 .",
    "this free boundary problem was mathematically analyzed by bertsch et al .",
    "for one @xcite and several spatial dimensions @xcite by using regular lagrangian flow techniques . in @xcite , a different approach based on viscosity perturbations",
    "was used to prove the existence of solutions . in @xcite ,",
    "the lagrangian techniques of @xcite were generalized showing , in particular , the non - uniqueness in the construction of solutions by this method .    in @xcite ,",
    "a conforming finite element method was used both for proving the existence of solutions of the viscosity approximations ( or for the case of @xmath22 satisfying ( [ h : def_pos ] ) ) , and for the numerical simulation of solutions . since in the case of positive semi - definite matrix @xmath22 solutions",
    "may develope discontinuities in finite time , the fem approximations exhibit instabilities in the neighborhood of these points . in this article",
    "we use a deterministic particle method to give an alternative for the numerical simulation of solutions .    in our context ,",
    "deterministic particle methods were introduced , for the scalar linear diffusion equation , by degond and mustieles in @xcite .",
    "lions and mas - gallic , in @xcite , gave a rigorous justification of the method with a generalization to nonlinear diffusion .",
    "gambino et al .",
    "@xcite studied a particle approximation to a cross - diffusion problem closely related to ours .",
    "let us finally remark that cross - diffusion parabolic systems have been used to model a variety of phenomena since the seminal work of shigesada , kawaski and teramoto @xcite .",
    "these models ranges from ecology @xcite , to semiconductor theory @xcite or granular materials @xcite , among others . global existence and regularity results for the evolution problem @xcite , and for the steady state @xcite have been provided .",
    "other interesting properties , such as pattern formation , has been studied in @xcite .",

    "the collective behavior of the discrete system may be given in terms of the spatial distribution of particles at time @xmath32 , expressed through the _ empirical measures _",
    "@xmath33 which give the spatial relative frequency of particles of the @xmath34-th population , at time @xmath32 .    using the weak formulation of ( [ eq : pde])-([eq : id ] ) and assuming , for the moment , @xmath35 , we find that @xmath36 satisfy , formally @xmath37 we may then initialize this system of ode s with a suitable particle approximation of the initial data @xmath10 to find an approximation to the solution of problem ( [ eq : pde])-([eq : id ] ) .    since the dirac delta measure is difficult to handle , one usually introduces a regularizing non - negative symmetric kernel @xmath38 such that @xmath39 , with @xmath40 and @xmath41 as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 denotes the dirac delta distribution .",

    "approximate @xmath72 taking advantage of the approximate position of the associated particles @xmath79 : @xmath80    notice that the first step above requires the determination of the solution of the nonlinear algebraic equation ( [ nonlinear - algeq ] ) .",
    "we compute an approximation to such solution by applying a fixed point algorithm .",
    "it consists of the following steps :    1 .",
    "initialize @xmath81 .",
    "2 .   for @xmath82 , given @xmath83 , @xmath84 3 .   check the stopping criteria , @xmath85    here , @xmath86 is a tolerance parameter and @xmath87 is a finite set of points . in our experiments",
    ", we take @xmath88 , and @xmath87 given by a uniform grid of points of @xmath89 , @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "notice that the initial condition in ( [ systemodes ] ) is given in terms of the initial location of the particles , whereas that of the original problem , ( [ eq : id ] ) , provides a value of their spatial distribution . in this sense ,",
    "given an initial condition @xmath92 in @xmath93 , we must study how to initialize @xmath94 and @xmath95 in such a way that @xmath96 on the one hand , to initialize the positions , we used a uniform grid of @xmath93 , that is , we simply took the set of points @xmath87 : @xmath97 on the other hand , to initialize the weights , one is temted to impose ( [ icond_aprox ] ) exactly on the points of @xmath87 .",
    "however , in doing so , negative weights arise , spoiling the convergence of the method . in consequence",
    ", we compared two different strategies :    * define @xmath98 ; * solve the following constrained linear least - squares problem : @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "although the first approach is faster , it introduces too much diffussion , whereas the second provides a more accurate approximation while preserving stability .",
    "a similar strategy applies to the particle redistribution after several time steps .",
    "indeed , let us recall that particle redistribution is tipically needed in particle simulations to avoid that particles get concentrated in some parts of the domain : if so , too big gaps between particles will arise in other parts , producing numerical instabilities .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a review on this issue and some alternative strategies that apply .",
    "finally , the boundary conditions ( [ eq : bc ] ) are taken into account by means of a specular reflection whenever a particle location is changed . although this is the most common approach to non - flow boundary conditions , border effects are noticiable in simple discretization schemes .",
    "for comparison purpouses , we use the finite element approximation of ( [ eq : pde])-([eq : id ] ) introduced in @xcite , eventually using the regularization of the flows ( [ def : flow ] ) given by @xmath102 for @xmath103 .",
    "the approximation is obtained by using a semi - implicit euler scheme in time and a @xmath104 continuous finite element approximation in space , see @xcite for the details where , in particular , the convergence of the fully discrete approximation to the continuous solution is proved .",
    "we now sketch the fem scheme .",
    "let @xmath105 be the time step of the discretization",

    "although both algorithms produce similar results , i.e. a good approximation outside a small neighborhood of the discontinuity @xmath153 , they behave in a different way . on one hand ,",

    "indeed , a jump of the derivative may be observed at the contact inhibition point .",
    "this effect is explained by the differences in the flows on the left and on the right of the contact inhibition point .",

    "the contact inhibition problem , i.e. equations ( [ eq : pde])-([def : reaction ] ) completed with initial data with disjoint supports , is an interesting problem from the mathematical point of view due mainly to the possibility of their solutions developing discontinuities in finite time .",
