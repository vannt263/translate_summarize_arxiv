    "in contrast , single transition metal ions are seldom considered as suitable candidates and the number of reported attempts to use them as mononuclear magnetic units is limited@xcite .",
    "the main reason is the widely known paradigm of orbital quenching. this suppression of the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment by the crystal electric field leads to a comparatively small anisotropy energy ( neglecting spin - orbit coupling , a pure spin contribution is by default isotropic ) .",

    "therefore , a tunnelling process is likely involved in the relaxation process where the applied magnetic field shifts the energy levels in and out of degeneracy in full analogy to smms . at this point",
    "it is not clear which levels of the single ion are brought in resonance by the applied magnetic field to explain the smaller steps in the @xmath64-@xmath65 loops .",
    "hyperfine interactions , as invoked for lanthanide based smms@xcite and liy@xmath134ho@xmath135f@xmath136@xcite , are likely too weak to account for steps at applied fields of @xmath137 t in particular since 98% of the fe - atoms do not carry a nuclear moment .",
    "energy barriers of similar ( @xmath138k@xcite ) or even higher size ( @xmath139k@xcite ) have been observed in mononuclear smms .",
    "however , the remanent magnetization for these samples is very small caused by short relaxation times at low temperatures , i.e. , @xmath80 deviates from arrhenius - behaviour with a relaxation time at the plateau in the order of seconds - in contrast to @xmath140s found for li@xmath6(li@xmath7fe@xmath16)n .",
    "the fortunate combination of a deviation from arrhenius behaviour at high temperatures ( @xmath141k ) with large values at the plateau leads to the extreme coercivities presented here . for potential data storage applications and stable magnetic materials , it is desirable to increase @xmath80 by suppressing the tunnel effect which can be achieved by enhanced exchange coupling@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "studying tunnelling phenomena by itself requires isolated magnetic moments .",
    "both goals can be satisfied by varying the fe concentration in li@xmath6(li@xmath7fe@xmath16)n accordingly .",
    "thus for low fe concentration of @xmath41 , statistically , 98% of the fe atoms have only li as nearest neighbours in the @xmath27-@xmath30 plane and fe - fe interactions are negligible .",
    "larger fe concentrations show higher coercivity fields at the lowest temperatures ( supplementary fig.[si - mag ] ) , which are caused by larger relaxation times , indicating that fe - fe interactions are indeed detrimental to tunnelling .",
    "provided the energy barriers can be further enhanced and tunnelling appropriately controlled this opens a route for the creation of hard permanent magnets from cheap and abundant elements .",
    "one remaining question is : why is quantum tunnelling so elusive in inorganic compounds ? besides our discovery in li@xmath6(li@xmath7fe@xmath16)n we are aware of only one other family of inorganic compounds showing macroscopic quantum tunnelling effects of the magnetization : liy@xmath134ho@xmath135f@xmath136@xcite and related systems .",
    "however , the characteristic energy scales are two orders of magnitude smaller than in li@xmath6(li@xmath7fe@xmath16)n and magnetic hysteresis emerges only below @xmath142mk with coercivity fields of @xmath143mt . to observe a macroscopic quantum effect such as tunnelling of the magnetization",
    ", the interaction between the magnetic moments has to be small .",
    "very generally , coupling leads to excitations ( modes ) , which lead to dissipation that destroys the quantum state .",
    "this rules out systems with dense , interacting moments .",
    "diluted systems of local magnetic moments have been the subject of extensive research mainly to study the kondo effect .",
    "this necessarily requires metallic samples ; the magnetic moments are not isolated but coupled to the electron bath which again leads to dissipation and the destruction of the quantum state .",
    "insulating samples with diluted or non - interacting magnetic moments have been far less studied - diluted magnetic semiconductors are explicitly excluded from this statement because of their finite carrier density . a possible explanation for the absence of magnetic tunnelling in insulators is a jahn - teller distortion which is frequently observed , e.g. , in lanthanide zircons of the form @xmath144o@xmath136 ( ref.@xcite and references therein ) . according to the jahn - teller theorem@xcite",
    "the orbital degeneracy of fe should cause a structural distortion also for li@xmath6(li@xmath7fe@xmath16)n in order to reach a stable state . in the diluted case",
    "it will occur locally for fe and not necessarily for the whole crystal .",
    "lifting the orbital degeneracy corresponds to a zero - orbital angular momentum , which is the only fully non - degenerate state .",
    "consequently , a jahn - teller distortion would lead to a loss of the magnetic anisotropy and a decay of the energy - barrier .",
    "however , the fe atom sits between two nitrogen neighbours which provide the dominant bonding .",
    "these three atoms can be regarded as acting like a linear molecule which is not subject to a jahn - teller distortion@xcite .",
    "to summarize , we demonstrated a huge magnetic anisotropy and coercivity in li@xmath6(li@xmath7fe@xmath16)n and want to emphasize the three properties which are probably essential for the emergence of macroscopic quantum tunnelling : ( i ) the compound is insulating , ( ii ) the orbital magnetic moment of fe is not quenched , and ( iii ) the n - fe - n complex forms a linear molecule avoiding a jahn - teller distortion .",
    "these properties may serve as a basis for the design of materials featuring even higher characteristic energy scales .",

    "we used pieces of the larger crystals for the magnetization measurements presented in this publication . + it should be noted that the smallest fe concentration of @xmath21 , as measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ( icp - ms , see below ) , was obtained without intentional introduction of fe in the melt .",
    "fe was most likely introduced as impurity from the starting materials or from the ta - crucible .",

    "+ argument 1 - based on magnetic properties .",
    "the effective moment is essentially independent of the fe concentration ( main text fig.[mag - intro]d ) .",

    "these would be diluted and non - interacting for @xmath114 but so dense for @xmath160 that a substantial overlap of randomly arranged clusters would occur .",
    "the peculiar magnetic properties of an isolated trimer ( e.g. superparamagnetism ) should be significantly different from a dense , interacting system .",
    "accordingly , a change of the effective moment with the fe concentration would be expected .",
    "this is not observed .",
    "however , covering the @xmath27-@xmath30 plane with non - touching fe dimers or with fe - n - fe chains along the crystallographic @xmath28-axis is possible even for the largest investigated fe concentration of @xmath20 . if",
    ", as reported in ref.@xcite , substantial higher fe concentrations can be grown this line of argument could be tested and analysed more rigorously .",

    "samples with low fe concentrations , @xmath41 and @xmath161 ( main article fig.[m - h]a and supplementary fig.[si - mag ] , respectively ) as well as @xmath21 ( not shown ) , show similar @xmath64-@xmath65 loops .",
    "if the magnetic centres are allowed to be of variable size , e.g. monomer , dimer and trimer , or just monomer and dimer , then it would be reasonable to assume that the distribution of the cluster size should change significantly with @xmath29 .",
    "accordingly the magnetic properties , such as step - size and step - position in the @xmath64-@xmath65 loops , would be expected to strongly change .",

    "in other words : if a single phase , mixed crystal forms for @xmath163 than it should form for lower fe concentrations as well . + argument 4 - based on kinetic aspects of the crystal growth .",
    "when we diluted the fe concentration down to @xmath164 a cluster formation seems unlikely .",
    "if regions with a fixed fe concentration ( e.g. @xmath165 or @xmath160 ) would grow preferentially then the fe should be concentrated in a small region of the growth whereas the majority of the product is expected to contain no fe at all .",
    "more specifically , an initial melt with the composition li : fe : n = 8.995:0.005:1 and total mass of 1.3 g is sufficient for the formation @xmath1477mm@xmath3 or @xmath14713 mg of @xmath165-material. however , the actual yield of such growths was found to be @xmath38200mm@xmath3 .",

    "when the applied field approaches the first resonance field at @xmath210 t the equilibrium state associated with @xmath211 t has not been reached .",
