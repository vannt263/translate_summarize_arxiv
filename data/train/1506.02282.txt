    "the creation of nucleon - antinucleon @xmath4 pairs from the electromagnetic ( em ) current is one of the most fundamental baryonic processes and therefore an ideal ground to examine their interactions .",
    "this process exhibits the transition between the perturbative and nonperturbative regime of qcd .",
    "close to the production threshold , it is dominated by meson exchange that gives rise to a strong enhancement @xcite . increasing the center - of - mass energy",
    ", one finds an intermediate region , where this first threshold enhancement has decreased , though a description in terms of perturbative qcd is not yet possible .",
    "we will focus in particular on the region below the occurrence of the @xmath5 .",
    "this region is very poorly understood so far , so that a mainly conceptual analysis as performed here is appropriate.the nucleon form factors ( nffs ) are the functions that parametrize the @xmath6 vertex generated by the strong interaction . in the intermediate region of interest here , an effective proton ff shows several structures .",
    "we discuss for the first time the possible main sources of these structures . on the one hand",
    ", we examine whether the newly pdg - listed vector meson @xmath1 might be relevant here . on the other hand , we investigate if such an effect could be due to the final state interaction ( fsi ) at the thresholds of the first resonance excitations , the @xmath7 + c.c . and @xmath3 thresholds , respectively .",
    "a possible @xmath7-cusp effect has been suggested by rosner @xcite , in analogy to the case of pion photoproduction off the nucleon @xcite , but never examined further.for the treatment of the @xmath1 , we consider a simultaneous description of the processes @xmath8 and @xmath9 , including observables for the proton and the neutron .",

    "@xmath3 thresholds are treated in a simplified model calculation.the unphysical region of the nffs is equally of interest , since a @xmath10 bound state , often denoted as baryonium , would be manifest below the physical threshold .",
    "indications for such a state around an invariant mass of @xmath11gev have been found in the invariant mass - spectra of the decays @xmath12 , @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , see e.g. refs .",
    "the binding of a baryonium state could be generated by the final state interaction , giving rise to a pole below threshold , that could be accommodated in a recent fsi analysis @xcite .",
    "the analytic continuation of the nffs that we obtain from fits to data into the unphysical region is also examined with the help of logarithmic dispersion relations , including the region of a possible baryonium pole .",
    "such an analytic continuation , however , requires the separation of the electric and magnetic nffs over all the included kinematical range .",
    "this separation depends on the ratio between electric and magnetic ff .",
    "a higher precision for this ratio than from previous measurements is expected from the planned @xmath16-annihilation experiment panda at fair @xcite.for completeness , it may be worthwhile mentioning the findings of a partial wave analysis ( pwa ) of @xmath17 elastic scattering in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a peak in the @xmath18 partial wave has been explained as due to an @xmath19-matrix pole at @xmath20gev and related to an unstable @xmath21 bound state .",

    "similarly , just below the @xmath22 threshold , a recent pwa including new neutron - proton scattering data @xcite confirmed a pole related to the @xmath23 , found at cosy @xcite , suggested to be a dibaryon .",

    "in general , the solution for the unknown part of @xmath180 can be searched for by discretizing the integral .",
    "our first choice would be a number of discretization points equal to the number of input points from the physical region , giving a set of @xmath159 linear equations with @xmath159 variables .",
    "however , the problem is strongly ill - conditioned , with small changes in the input leading to large changes in the solution .",

    "we minimize the difference between left- and right - hand - side of eq .  , while also limiting the total curvature of the ffs in the unphysical region , @xmath187 . for the result",
    ", we find a large dependence on the strength of the curvature limitation and on the range that we use for input from @xmath188 .",
    "thus reliable errors can not be quantified here .",
    "however , we want to point out that large enhancements in the ff modulus just below production threshold are possible . in the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ln ] , one can see such an enhancement just below @xmath181 , as expected in the case of a baryonium pole . for the planned precision of the forthcoming measurements at panda",
    ", these possibilities should be further evaluated . encouraging in this regard",
    "are also previous results for the pion ff @xcite , where the predictive power of this method can be impressively illustrated .",
    "a major source of complication in the nucleon case is the neccessity of two ffs and their separation .",
    "the emphasis on measuring the angular distribution at panda will have particular impact on this separation .",
    "in this paper , we have examined the em @xmath16 creation and the mechanisms that dominate it in the domain of nonperturbative qcd .",
    "specifically , we have discussed possible contributions to the nffs corresponding to a vector meson recently listed in the pdg as @xmath1 or from fsi at the @xmath7 + c.c . and",
    "@xmath3 thresholds.we have included the @xmath1 in simultaneous fits to proton and neutron ffs for space- and timelike momenta and found good agreement with the existing data . in particular",
    ", we included recent measurements on the neutron effective ff .",
    "in contrast to the previous fenice experiment and analyses of this , the recent snd data shows a very similar behavior to the proton effective ff over a large range , which we can describe well in our approach . however , the range around the @xmath1 calls for further neutron measurements to allow for a determination of the isospin channel of the structures in @xmath105.it may be worthwhile mentioning here , that similar fits to data only in the spacelike region , as performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , found exactly two ( `` effective '' ) poles in the physical timelike region , one at @xmath189  gev and one at @xmath85  gev , each @xmath190  mev below the @xmath7 and @xmath3 thresholds , respectively .",
    "accordingly , we have also examined possible contributions from the final state interactions at these thresholds .",
    "taking approximations for the fsi into account allows for a similarly good description of the @xmath105 data as the inclusion of the @xmath1 .",
    "the occurrence of peaks in @xmath105 around both @xmath79 thresholds might favor this explanation .",
    "however , future calculations should include the singularity structures of any possibly contributing diagram and all interferences .",
    "in particular for the case that some structures indeed exist below the thresholds , a resummation of the fsi diagrams is clearly necessary to calculate the pole of such a bound state . in this context",
    "it may be of interest , that the small deviation at @xmath191  gev lies close to the @xmath192 threshold.in order to distinguish between the possible effects we are awaiting polarization measurements at fair from which one can extract the relative phase of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "this will also improve the precision of the analytic continuation to the region of a possible baryonium pole . using logarithmic dispersion relations ,",
    "we have found that such a pole with large contributions to the nffs could exist .",
