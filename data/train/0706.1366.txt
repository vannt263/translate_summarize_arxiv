    "in the present paper we study a special class of time - optimal control problems on two - dimensional manifolds : the zermelo-like problems . by zermelo-like problems we mean the class of time - optimal control problems formed by the classical zermelo s navigation problems on riemannian manifolds and the corresponding co - problems .",
    "our first goal in this paper is to describe these two problems and give an explicit expression for their control curvature , the latter being the control analogue of the gaussian curvature of surfaces .",
    "this is the purpose of section [ z-like_pb ] .",
    "zermelo s navigation problem aims to find the minimum time trajectories in a riemannian manifold @xmath0 under the influence of a drift represented by a vector field @xmath1 .",
    "the study of zermelo s navigation problem began in 1931 with the work by e. zermelo @xcite and a while latter by c. carathodory in @xcite .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite , zermelo s navigation problem has been studied has a special case of finslerian metrics and has been an efficient tool in order to give a complete classification of strongly convex randers metrics of constant flag curvature , the latter being the finslerian analogue of the riemannian sectional curvature .",
    "the co - zermelo s navigation problem on a riemannian surface @xmath0 with drift @xmath2 , where @xmath2 is a one - form on @xmath3 , is a time - optimal for which the maximized hamiltonian function @xmath4 resulting of pontryagin maximum principle has level one equal to the fiber bundle @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the unitary riemannian cosphere of the metric @xmath7 .",
    "what is surprising with this definition of the problem is that it naturally leads to choose a good system of coordinates in which the control curvature has very nice and simple expression as a function of the drift one - form and the gaussian curvature of the metric @xmath7 .",
    "contrary to the zermelo s navigation problem the curvature of the co - zermelo problem is much more readable than the one zermelo problem itself and thus , much more exploitable .",
    "another surprising property of the co - zermelo s problem is that its flow is just a time rescaling of the magnetic flow of the pair @xmath8 , the latter being solution of a fixed time variational problem . in particular , it implies that the curvature of the problem of a charged particle in a magnetic field is just a reparametrization of the curvature of co - zermelo problem .",
    "we prove constructively that zermelo s navigation problem on @xmath0 with drift vector field @xmath1 is feedback equivalent to a co - zermelo problem but this time with respect to another riemannian metric .",
    "this is the contents of proposition [ equivzerdz ] and its corollary [ feedback_equiv_zer - cozer ] in  [ duality ] .",
    "this proposition is fundamental because it points out that there are two different riemannian metrics canonically associated to a given zermelo problem . in particular",
    ", it implies that the two problems have the same curvature and also allows to see a zermelo s navigation problem as its dual co - zermelo problem and vice versa .",
    "this is of particular interest because the presentation of a given zermelo s navigation problem as its feedback equivalent co - zermelo problem has the serious advantage to present the curvature of the considered problem in an easier to handle formula .",
    "it is thus , clearly , the way to do .",
    "it also show how the classical zermelo s navigation problem is linked to magnetic flows .",
    "it is the second goal of this paper to show that there is a natural way to generalize the classical gauss - bonnet formula for riemannian surfaces to an inequality for zermelo - like problems .",
    "more precisely , we will see that , given a zermelo-like problem on a surface @xmath3 there exists a canonically defined positive function @xmath9 such that @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the euler characteristic of @xmath3 , @xmath12 is the hypersurface @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the liouville volume on @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , the function @xmath9 takes the constant value equal to one if and only if the zermelo problem is indeed riemannian , in which case the inequality turns to be the classical gauss - bonnet formula .",
    "this theorem [ gb ] in  [ sectiongb ] of the paper .",
    "our last goal in this paper is to generalize for zermelo s problems the e. hopf s theorem which asserts that two - dimensional riemannian tori without conjugate points are flat .",
    "this will be done in two steps following the hopf s method .",
    "first we show that if a control system on a compact surface without boundary has no conjugate points then , its total curvature @xmath15 must be negative or zero and , in the latter case its curvature must be zero identically .",
    "this is theorem [ e.hopf_th].the second step is to use the gauss - bonnet inequality together with theorem [ e.hopf_th ] to deduce flatness . in the riemannian situation theorem [ e.hopf_th ] together with the gauss - bonnet inequality ( which , in this case , reduces to the classical gauss - bonnet formula ) imply straightforwardly flatness for tori without conjugate points .",
    "of course theorem [ e.hopf_th ] applies to zermelo-like problems but , due to the presence of the function @xmath9 in the gauss - bonnet inequality , the situation is more delicate and essentially different .",
    "indeed , a zermelo-like problem without conjugate points on a riemannian torus is not necessarily flat unless its total curvature is zero .",
    "this situation is described in theorem [ e.hopf_th_for_zer ] and its corollaries [ e.hopf_th_for_dz_on_t^2 ] and [ flat_zer-like_pbs_on_t^2 ] .    to conclude our paper we discuss the further generalizations of the presented results to more general situations than the riemannian one .",
    "we will see that even in the special case of landsberg surfaces surfaces not all results can be transposed .",
    "in the present paper smooth objects are supposed to be of class @xmath16 .",
    "let us fix some notations .",
    "for a two - dimensional manifold @xmath3 , @xmath17 is the cotangent bundle to @xmath3 .",
    "we denote by @xmath18 the canonical liouville one - form on @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath3 is endowed with a riemannian structure @xmath7 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the riemannian scalar product and the riemannian norm respectively . since the riemannian structure defines a canonical identification between the tangent and cotangent bundle of @xmath3 , we use the notations of the scalar product and norm indifferently for vectors and covectors , vector fields and one - forms .",
    "we denote by @xmath24 and @xmath25 the unitary spherical bundle @xmath26 and the unitary cospherical bundle @xmath27 respectively .",
    "we briefly recall some facts concerning the curvature of smooth control systems in dimension two . for more details on the subject",
    "we refer the reader to one of the following items @xcite .",
    "consider the following time - optimal smooth control problem @xmath28 where @xmath3 and @xmath29 are connected smooth manifolds of respective dimension two and one .",
    "for the above time - optimal control problem we denote by @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , the ( normal ) hamiltonian function of pmp ( pontryagin maximum principle ) , by @xmath33 , and by @xmath34 the hamiltonian field associated with the restriction of @xmath4 to @xmath12 .",
    "recall that the maximized hamiltonian @xmath4 is a function on the cotangent bundle @xmath19 one - homogeneous on fibers and non - negative . under the regularity assumptions of strong convexity @xmath35 the curve",

    "vector field @xmath39 is characterized by the fact that it is , up to sign , the unique vector field on @xmath12 such that @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a smooth function on the level @xmath12 .",
    "the function @xmath41 , which is by definition a feedback - invariant , is called the centro - affine curvature .    the vector fields @xmath34 and @xmath39 which are , by definition , feedback - invariant satisfy the following nontrivial commutator relation : @xmath42 \\big ] = \\kappa { \\boldsymbol}{v},\\ ] ] where the coefficient @xmath43 is defined to be _ the control curvature _ or simply _ the curvature _ of the optimal control problem ( [ optpb_dyn])-([optpb_cost ] ) .",
    "the control curvature is by definition a feedback - invariant of the control system and a function on @xmath12 ( and not on @xmath3 as the gaussian one ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath43 is the gaussian curvature if the control system defines a riemannian geodesic problem .",
