    "collisions of two cold media and subsequent formation of shocks propagating into both sides of the contact surface provide an efficient way to convert the kinetic energy of the flows into the internal energy of the shocked media .",

    "the stellar mantle ejected as a result of the explosion could give rise to bright emission , which is observed as a core - collapse supernova ( ccsn ) . a small fraction of ccsne",

    "the hydrodynamical interaction of the ejecta and the csm is of vital importance in understanding electromagnetic signals from some kinds of sne .",

    "radio and x - ray observations of several sne have been carried out and succeeded in constraining the csm density by using those theoretical models .    when the csm is sufficiently dense",

    "in fact , bright emission found in a special class of sne with prominent hydrogen narrow lines in their spectra , type iin sne , is explained by the hydrodynamical interaction .",
    "moreover , there is increasing evidence that some events spectroscopically classified as normal sne must have exploded in a dense csm or with an extended envelope attached @xcite , suggesting the important roles played by the ejecta - csm interaction especially at the very beginning of the dynamical evolution of sn ejecta .",

    "we denote the kinetic energy in units of @xmath37 erg by @xmath38 . the total kinetic energy of the ejecta obtained by the following integral , @xmath39 highly depends on the exponent @xmath26 .",

    "these studies focus on the emergence of a strong shock wave from a stellar atmosphere with spherical symmetry or in plane - parallel geometry .",
    "@xcite showed that trans - relativistic and ultra - relativistic parts of the ejecta are characterized by a power - law function of the 4-velocity with an exponent @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",

    "the total mass of the ejecta can be very small especially for small values of @xmath26 .",

    "it is not our purpose to reproduce the density distribution of supernova ejecta precisely .",
    "the ejecta collide with an ambient medium whose density profile is a power - law function of the radius with an exponent @xmath55 , @xmath56 in particular , we regard the ambient medium as a steady wind at a constant mass - loss rate and thus set the exponent @xmath57 to @xmath58 throughout this work .",

    "llgrbs 980425 , 060218 , and 100316d , are found to be well explained by the interaction - powered emission from spherical ejecta .",
    "grbs 060218 and 100318d are best explained by interaction - powered emission from relativistic ejecta with a kinetic energy of @xmath91-@xmath92 and a csm with @xmath93-@xmath94 .",
    "the large value of the parameter @xmath72 required to explain their long - lasting x - ray emission implies a mass - loss rate close to @xmath95 yr@xmath1 when a typical wind velocity of wolf - rayet stars , @xmath96 km s@xmath1 , is adopted .",
    "the implied large amount of csm has also been pointed out by several authors since the discovery of grb 060218 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "grb 980425 is reproduced by models with moderate values of the parameter @xmath72 and an even small kinetic energy , @xmath81-@xmath82 , is sufficient to account for the isotropic gamma - ray energy of this relatively less energetic event . for larger values of the exponent @xmath26",
    ", a larger kinetic energy is required for grb 980425 , since a larger @xmath26 means that a smaller fraction of the kinetic energy is distributed throughout the outer layers of the ejecta , resulting in emission with longer rise times .",
    "several grbs are located above the lines corresponding to models with the largest kinetic energy @xmath97 in all panels of figure [ fig : diagram ] .",
    "in other words , they can not be explained by the interaction - powered emission .",
    "assuming ejecta with a kinetic energy larger than @xmath97 is less likely , because the value @xmath97 is already comparable to the kinetic energy of particularly energetic sne , i.e. , hypernovae , and a considerable fraction of the total kinetic energy of sn ejecta is usually distributed in slower non - relativistic ejecta rather than outer layers .",
    "thus , it seems unfeasible to distribute even more kinetic energy throughout the faster part of the ejecta while the spherical symmetry is kept .",
    "these bursts require relativistic jets powered by central engines      our model predicts bolometric properties of the emission from the shocked gas and provides little information on the spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth discussing the following points regarding the expected spectrum .",
    "the discussion on the thermal equilibrium time scale implies that the balance between absorption and emission of photons via free - free process is achieved at early stages of the dynamical evolution of the shell , @xmath98 s and @xmath96 s for @xmath99 and @xmath87 ( see figure [ fig : time_scales ] ) . in particular , for the model shown in figures [ fig : lc ] and [ fig : lc_dt ]",
    ", the decoupling occurs at @xmath100 s. the reverse shock pressure at the time is @xmath101 , leading to an equilibrium temperature of @xmath102 k. thus , these photons are expected to show a temperature of a few @xmath103 k or equivalently an average energy of @xmath104 kev at the decoupling and contribute to the emission as a thermal component .",
    "in fact , a thermal component has been found in the x - ray spectra of grb 060218 @xcite and 100318d @xcite .",
    "the presence of a thermal component with temperature of @xmath105 kev , relatively low spectral peak energy ( @xmath106 and 18 kev , respectively ) , and their peculiarly long x - ray emission may indicate that their emission originates from the interaction between a dense csm and mildly relativistic ejecta .",
    "the contribution of the thermal component to the total x - ray flux is only @xmath107 % and @xmath48-@xmath50 % for grb 060218 and 100318d .",
    "however , the low temperature , @xmath82-@xmath108 kev , compared with the spectral peak energy means that thermal photons dominate the total photon number .",
    "our model suggests that thermal photons with a temperature of @xmath109-@xmath108 kev predominantly exist until the decoupling , which reasonably agrees with the observations . since the energy injection through the reverse shock continues even after the decoupling",
    ", the freshly injected energy would play a role in powering a small fraction of photons remaining in the shocked region and producing a non - thermal component . for the model shown in figures [ fig : lc ] and [ fig : lc_dt ] , the internal energy of the shell at the decoupling @xmath100 s is @xmath110 erg , while the value at @xmath111 is @xmath112 erg .",
    "thus , an additional energy of the order of @xmath113 erg can be used to further power the photons .",
    "because of the freeze - out of the photon number , when this additional energy is simply used to increase the average energy of the whole remaining photons , the increase in the photon energy , which is given by @xmath114 , is only a factor of a few .",
    "the increased average photon energy is @xmath115 kev , which does not explain the spectral peak energies of llgrbs .",
    "this is the reason why some mechanism decoupling a small fraction of photons from the thermal equilibrium should play a role .",
    "for example , when a few to 10 percent of the remaining photons could predominantly gain the additional energy , an energy larger than the average photon energy by a factor of @xmath84-@xmath116 , @xmath117-@xmath84 kev , would be achieved .",
    "in fact , this simple consideration overestimates the contribution of the thermal photons to the total radiated energy , @xmath118 .",
    "thus , a more sophisticated model taking into account the process producing non - thermal photons should be developed to explain observations of llgrbs in a self - consistent way .",
    "however , revealing the mechanism responsible for producing the non - thermal component is beyond the reach of this study , where a simplified one - zone model is used to describe the shocked region .",
    "there is also the possibility that the spherical shell is not responsible for producing non - thermal photons and the non - thermal component can instead arise from a weak jet rather than the shell ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent discussion ) .",
    "in other words , the combination of non - thermal emission from a jet and thermal emission from the associated quasi - spherical ejecta , such as a cocoon , accounts for the emission from llgrbs . in this case , just up to @xmath107 % of the total x - ray flux should be explained by the ejecta - ambient interaction and make the required kinetic energy of the ejecta smaller by an order of magnitude .",
    "in this study , we have developed a semi - analytical model for the hydrodynamical evolution of freely expanding trans - relativistic ejecta interacting with an ambient medium whose density is inversely proportional to the square of the radius .",
    "our model successfully reproduces results of numerical simulations .",
    "furthermore , we have presented an emission model in which photons are diffusing out from the geometrically thin and optically thick shell resulting from the hydrodynamical interaction .",
    "then , we have examined the possibility that the csm interaction contributes to x - ray and gamma - ray emission from grbs associated with sne , including several events classified as llgrbs .",
    "our results give a threshold on the @xmath77-@xmath119 plane , above which gamma - ray emission of any grb can not be explained by the interaction - powered emission from mildly relativistic , spherical ejecta .",
    "the csm interaction can not explain grbs releasing a large amount of gamma - ray energy during short duration , such as grb 030329 , 031203 , and 120422a , which suggests that they require a certain central engine activity to deposit a significant amount of energy into a small solid angle .",
    "this result agrees with @xcite , who claimed that the time - averaged luminosity of the gamma - ray emission could distinguish central - engine powered grbs from llgrbs .",
    "our results suggest that the circum - burst environment would be a key to distinguishing grbs characterized by long - lasting soft x - ray emission from normal grbs .",
    "recently , @xcite studied x - ray emission from grbs found in the nearby universe and found that some grbs exhibit the following properties : ( 1 ) long - lasting gamma - ray emission with @xmath120 s , ( 2 ) a large absorption column density by neutral hydrogen , and ( 3 ) late - time super soft x - ray emission .",
    "they pointed out that these events were possibly explosions of stars surrounded by dense materials having been lost from the stellar surface as a stellar wind , although they could not exclude another possibility that these events originate from unusual progenitor systems .",
    "it is found that a considerably dense csm , mass - loss rates larger than @xmath121 @xmath122 yr@xmath1 for a wind velocity of @xmath96 km s@xmath1 , is required for grb 060218 and 100316d .",
    "how such dense csm is produced during the evolution toward the core - collapse is still unclear . however , spectroscopic observations of sne at very early stages may shed light on the origin .",
    "recent observations of type iib sn 2013cu @xcite at the very beginning of its evolution suggested that it was the explosion of a wolf - rayet star with an extremely dense csm or stellar envelope attached . from the luminosity of the h@xmath123 line emission found in the early optical spectrum of sn 2013cu , they argued the presence of a strong stellar wind with a mass - loss rate of the order of @xmath124 yr@xmath1 and a wind velocity of the order of @xmath96 km s@xmath1 in the vicinity of the progenitor star .",
    "more detailed spectral modeling later found that the wind velocity appeared to be smaller than the value obtained by @xcite , but the mass - loss rate was similar .",
    "furthermore , recent spectroscopic observations of sne found by the palomar transient factory suggest that a non - negligible fraction of the sne exhibits spectral signatures similar to sn 2013cu @xcite in their early optical spectra .",
    "if a highly energetic explosion producing relativistic ejecta occurs in a similar environment , the ejecta - csm interaction would give rise to bright x - ray or gamma - ray emission like grbs 060218 and 100316d .",
    "on the other hand , radio observations and light curve modelings of grbs associated with sne imply relatively dilute circum - burst environments .",
    "for example , @xcite carried out radio and x - ray observations of grb 100316d and estimated the mass - loss rate of @xmath125 @xmath122 yr@xmath1 for a wind velocity of @xmath96 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this discrepancy could be resolved by introducing a non - steady mass losing process .",
    "in other words , radio observations would probe the csm at more distant regions from the explosion site than the csm predominantly dissipating the kinetic energy of the ejecta .",
    "the geometrically thin shell becoming transparent at @xmath126 s is located at a distance of @xmath127 cm , where materials ejected a few days before the explosion should be present for a wind velocity of @xmath128 . on the other hand ,",
    "radio observations are usually carried out 10 - 100 days after the discovery , when relativistic ejecta traveling at speeds close to the speed of light have reached at a distance of @xmath129 cm .",
    "the corresponding traveling time scale of the wind at a velocity @xmath128 is @xmath84-@xmath86 yrs .",
    "thus , the drastic change in the mass - loss history of the progenitor , if it existed , must have occurred @xmath84-@xmath86 yrs before the explosion .",
    "radio observations of llgrbs also suggest that the radio - emitting ejecta still have sub - relativistic velocities , @xmath130 , and the kinetic energy of the ejecta is comparable to the isotropic energy of the gamma - ray emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if the shell resulting from the ejecta - csm interaction continued to decelerate in a dense csm , the shell velocity would be non - relativistic and most of the kinetic energy would be lost at later stages of the dynamical evolution .",
    "thus , the termination of the dense csm in a distant region from the explosion site is also required to explain the dynamics of radio emitting ejecta .",
    "the total radiated energy and the duration of the emission predicted by our emission model do not strongly depend on the gradient of the assumed kinetic energy distribution , which is characterized by the power - law exponent @xmath26 , especially for ambient media with high densities .",
    "however , the temporal evolution of the spectrum of the emission must depend on @xmath26 . smaller values of @xmath26 correspond to ejecta with larger kinetic energy at the outermost layer .",
    "ejecta traveling at higher lorentz factor are expected to emit harder photons due to the lorentz boost .",
    "therefore , when ejecta with a kinetic energy distribution with a smaller @xmath26 are responsible for the x - ray and gamma - ray emission , the spectrum is dominated by hard photons , while a softer spectrum is expected for ejecta with a steep kinetic energy distribution .",
    "the difference in the hardness of observed spectra must be a key to investigating what kind of kinetic energy distribution is realized in llgrbs .    how the assumed kinetic energy distribution is related to the hardness of the resultant emission",
    "should be quantitatively studied by performing hydrodynamic simulations with multi - frequency radiative transfer , which would also clarify whether a thermal component is really present in the spectrum of the emission and how repeated compton scatterings shape the spectrum .",
    "we appreciate the anonymous referee for his / her constructive comments , which greatly helped us to improve the manuscript .",

    "in this section , we describe the method to evaluate the energy loss rate through radiative diffusion from a geometrically thin and optically thick shell moving at a relativistic speed . in the following ,",
    "we consider two inertial frames , the laboratory frame , in which the shell is traveling at a velocity @xmath132 , and the comoving frame , in which the shell is at rest .",
    "we denote quantities in the laboratory and comoving frames by letters with and without a prime , e.g. , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .    since the radiative energy loss rate does not change under the lorentz transformation , @xmath135 , we derive the rate in the comoving frame at first . the transfer equation for the frequency - integrated intensity @xmath136 with spherical symmetry",
    "is given by , @xmath137 where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the time and the radial coordinate and @xmath140 is the direction cosine . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume isotropic scattering and @xmath141 gives the scattering opacity . in the diffusion approximation",
    ", we only consider the zeroth and first angular moments of the intensity .",
    "thus , the intensity is expressed as follows , @xmath142 the zeroth and first angular moments of the transfer equation ( [ eq : transfer ] ) with equation ( [ eq : i ] ) lead to @xmath143 and @xmath144 as usually done in the diffusion approximation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we assume that the time derivative of the first moment @xmath145 is much smaller than the other terms in the above equation .",
    "thus , equation ( [ eq : dhdt ] ) yield @xmath146    here we consider a spherical shell with the outer radius @xmath147 and width @xmath148 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the radiation energy of the shell is lost from @xmath149 via radiative diffusion .",
    "we multiply equation ( [ eq : djdt ] ) by @xmath150 and integrate the product with respect to the radius from @xmath151 to @xmath152 . further multiplying the result with @xmath153 , which corresponds to the integration over the solid angle , one obtains the rate of the radiative energy loss from the outer radius , @xmath154 when the width of the shell is negligibly small as assumed in this paper , equation ( [ eq : h ] )",
    "can be approximated as follows , @xmath155 here , @xmath156 is the optical depth of the shell , @xmath157 , which is lorentz invariant .",
    "thus , the radiative energy loss rate in the comoving frame is obtained as follows , @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the radiation energy density in the comoving frame .",
    "this equation also gives the radiative energy loss rate in the laboratory frame .",
    "next , we obtain the relation between the zeroth moments @xmath160 and @xmath161 in the comoving and laboratory frames to express the radiative energy loss rate in terms of the radiation energy density in the laboratory frame . the lorentz transformations of the intensity and the direction cosine lead to @xmath162 and @xmath163 where @xmath164 .",
    "the zeroth angular moment of this equation leads to @xmath165.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting equation ( [ eq : h2 ] ) into the r.h.s . of this equation ,",
    "one obtains the following relation between @xmath160 and @xmath161 , @xmath166 which also holds for the radiation energy densities , @xmath167 and @xmath168 , @xmath169 thus , the radiative energy loss rate can be expressed in terms of the radiation energy density in the laboratory frame as follows , @xmath170",
    "and [ fig : profile ] . ]    in this section , we provide results of the convergence study of our numerical simulations . in the simulations performed in section [ sec : numerical ] , the whole numerical domain is covered by @xmath171 at the lowest amr level and the time step is set to @xmath172 .",
    "we carry out additional four simulations with the same parameter as the model in figures [ fig : evolution ] and [ fig : profile ] but with different spatial and temporal resolutions .",
    "the number of the numerical cells at the lowest amr level and the time step are doubled and halved compared to the fiducial model , @xmath173 ,  @xmath174 , @xmath175 , and @xmath176 .",
    "the evolution is followed up to @xmath177 s. figure [ fig : resolution ] shows the results .",
    "the panels show the radial profiles of the density from @xmath178 to @xmath179 in units of @xmath180 cm at @xmath177 s. in each panel , the result of the simulation is plotted as a solid line and compared with the fiducial model ( dashed line ) with @xmath181 .",
    "the different models show quite similar density profiles , proving the convergence of the simulation shown in this paper .",
