    "particle motion in glassy systems is frequently conceptualized as consisting of caging periods , during which the system rattles around in a energy minimum of its energy landscape , interrupted by transitions between minima . in this scenario",
    "the features of the potential energy landscape ( pel ) play a fundamental role in determining the overall dynamical properties .",
    "one way to investigate how a system explores its pel is via the study of the instantaneous normal modes ( inm )  @xcite , which are the instantaneous eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hessian matrix .",
    "the eigenvalues give information about the curvatures of the pel hypersurface around the point the system is visiting , while the eigenvectors give the corresponding directions for the joint motion of particles through phase space . as concerns the dynamical features of the system , the negative eigenvalues are of particular interest as they identify the unstable modes of the system  @xcite .",
    "specifically , some of these negative eigenvalues are expected to be directly related to diffusion .",
    "it is clear , however , that not all of the unstable modes can contribute to diffusion as unstable modes are also observed at temperatures which are sufficiently low for the diffusion constant to be negligible .",
    "strategies must therefore be devised to determine which are the unstable modes that are relevant to particle diffusion  @xcite .    here",
    "we explore a proposal by la nave and coworkers  @xcite , who suggested that the unstable modes allowing for diffusion are those connecting different energy minima , known as double ",
    "well modes . indeed , a one  to  one relation between the diffusion constant and the fraction @xmath0 of double ",
    "well modes has been observed in a range of model systems  @xcite , we note that a different approach , where the modes contributing to diffusion are identified with the unstable and extended ones , and detected via a finite  size scaling analysis  @xcite , has recently been shown to yield analogous results  @xcite .    in order to investigate the relation between the features of the potential energy landscape and the diffusion constant of liquids , we focus on a simple model characterized by water - like density anomalies , i.e.  regions of the phase diagram where the dynamics speeds up upon isothermal compression .",
    "we first consider two state points with the same diffusion constant @xmath1 and same temperature , but different densities , and show that key dynamical features coincide at all length and time scales . indeed , not only are the diffusion constants equal , but also the mean square displacements and the self - intermediate scattering ( i.e.  incoherent correlation ) functions at different wavevectors coincide at all times .",
    "differences are observed only in four  point quantities such as the non  linear dynamical susceptibility .",
    "we then consider how the pel changes with density , and how these changes are related to those in the dynamics .",
    "we show that the typical distance between two energy minima connected by a double  well mode , as well as the associated typical energy barrier , increase monotonically with density .",
    "both quantities must thus be different for two state points at different density , even if they have the same diffusion constant .",
    "on the other hand , the fraction of unstable normal modes connecting different energy minima @xmath0 varies non  monotonically with the density .",
    "this ensures it is correlated with the diffusion constant , but our results do not support the presence of a one  to  one relation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 such as has previously been seen in other systems .",
    "as a simple model system for investigating the relation between the dynamics and the features of the energy landscape we consider a polydisperse mixture of @xmath2 harmonic disks of identical mass @xmath3 , in two dimensions .",
    "diameters are uniformly distributed in the range @xmath4 $ ] , with the difference @xmath5 between the largest and smallest diameter being 82% of the mean diameter @xmath6 so that the distribution is fairly broad ; this is necessary to prevent crystallization .",
    "two particles @xmath7 and @xmath8 interact via the repulsive harmonic potential @xmath9 the interaction is of finite range : particles interact only if their distance @xmath10 is smaller than their average diameter @xmath11 .",
    "lengths , masses and energies are expressed below in units of @xmath12 , @xmath3 and of @xmath13 , respectively , and the density is specified in terms of the volume ( or more precisely , area ) fraction @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 is the system size , @xmath16 the average particle area , and @xmath2 the number of particles .",
    "we have performed molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite of this system with @xmath17 particles , integrating the equations of motion using the verlet algorithm , with a timestep of @xmath18 .",
    "dynamical quantities are averaged over @xmath19 independent runs .",
    "the system is first brought to thermal equilibrium via simulations in the nvt ensemble , while production runs are carried out in the nve ensemble .",
    "thermal equilibration is ascertained by checking for the absence of aging .",
    "the inms are determined by equilibrating a larger sample , consisting of @xmath20 particles , and averaging over @xmath21 independent realizations to obtain accurate statistics .",
    "non  monotonic density dependence of the diffusion constant .",
    "the arrows indicate the states @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which have similar diffusion constants . ]    in the majority of molecular and colloidal fluids the dynamics slows down upon isothermal compression .",
    "there are , however , fluids that display the opposite behavior in some region of their temperature  density phase diagram . such density anomalies are found in a number of fluids ; the most important of these is certainly water , with other examples including si , ge , sn , and ionic melts with suitable radius ratios , such as sio@xmath24 , bef@xmath24 and geo@xmath24  @xcite . while all of these systems have an anisotropic interaction potential that favors short - range tetrahedral order around the particle centers , density anomalies have been also observed in models with spherically symmetric interaction potentials  @xcite .",
    "these systems have been studied extensively to identify the physical origin of density anomalies and to connect them to specific features of the interaction potential .",
    "the harmonic potential considered in this work is an example of a radially symmetric potential giving rise to a density anomaly , as illustrated by the non  monotonic dependence of the self  diffusion constant on volume fraction shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffusivity ] . we have previously investigated the physical mechanisms responsible for this behavior , and concluded that it must be attributed to the emergence of contacts between a particle and those of its second coordination shell  @xcite . in the following",
    "we first compare the dynamical features of two state points , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , that have approximately the same diffusion constant , @xmath25 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diffusivity ] ) , and then study the density dependence of some important features of the energy landscape .",
    "as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffusivity ] , the presence of a density anomaly means that at a given temperature there are pairs of points that have different density but the same diffusion constant , such as state points @xmath26 and @xmath27 . due to the difference in density , one might expect the dynamics at these state points to be different in general , apart from sharing an overall timescale set by the diffusion constant .",
    "surprisingly , we find that the opposite is true : state points with the same diffusion constant share many dynamical features .",
    "consider first the mean square displacement shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : msd ] .",
    "it is equal between the two state points not only at long time , where this is expected because the two states have equal diffusion constant , but in fact at all times to within our numerical accuracy .",
    "this is consistent with the existence of a close link between the debye ",
    "waller factor , which is the value of the mean square displacement in the plateau region , and the diffusion constant .",
    "such a link has been put forward on more general grounds  @xcite , and we have previously verified that it applies across a large part of the phase diagram of the model system considered here  @xcite .",
    "the mean square displacement is given by the variance of the self part of the van hove function , @xmath28 , defined here as the probability that a particle has moved a distance @xmath10 along one coordinate ( say @xmath29-)axis at time @xmath30 .",
    "to investigate the relation between the dynamics at state points @xmath26 and @xmath27 more closely , we therefore next look at the van hove function itself .",
    "[ fig : msd ] shows that , surprisingly , the van hove functions  evaluated for the same time interval @xmath30  at @xmath26 and @xmath27 coincide not just in their variance , but in their entire functional dependence on @xmath10 .",
    "the observed equality of the van hove functions suggests that in fact the dynamics of the two systems might be equal at all relevant length scales .",
    "we have checked this by measuring the self  intermediate scattering ( or incoherent correlation ) function , @xmath31 \\right\\rangle $ ] for @xmath32 different wavevectors @xmath33 with lengths @xmath34 evenly spaced between @xmath35 and @xmath36 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fk ] , @xmath26 and @xmath27 have very similar self  intermediate scattering functions , at all times and length scales .",
    "of course @xmath37 is related to @xmath28 , essentially by fourier transform , so this equality primarily provides a consistency check that equality of the dynamics is found both in real and fourier space .",
    "we note that a similar collapse can not be observed in the distinct part of the van hove function , @xmath38 , as at @xmath39 this coincides with the radial distribution function , which is distinct for states having different densities .",
    "similarly , no collapse can be observed in the total  intermediate scattering function .    digging deeper , differences in the dynamics at state points @xmath26 and @xmath27 finally turn up in the _ fluctuations _ of the self  intermediate scattering function .",
    "if we denote this fluctuating version of @xmath37 by @xmath40 $ ] then its variance defines the so  called dynamical susceptibility @xmath41 $ ] . in this quantity",
    "we do find clear differences between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fk ] . in particular ,",
    "while the susceptibilities attain their maximum roughly at the same time @xmath42 for any given @xmath43 , the actual maximal value @xmath44 is smaller for state @xmath27 , i.e.  in the anomalous region .",

    "above we have found strong similarities between the dynamical properties of the equal - diffusion constant state points @xmath26 and @xmath27 . if there is a significant correlation between the dynamics and the properties of the energy landscape , then this would suggest that the energy landscapes of states @xmath26 and @xmath27 should also have closely related features .",
    "more specifically this should apply to the statistics of those landscape properties that are directly related to the dynamics .",
    "accordingly , by comparing different features of the energy landscape of the two states , we can infer to what extent they correlate with the dynamics .    to characterize the energy landscape statistics we employ the instantaneous normal mode approach , and thus focus on the properties of the eigenvalues @xmath48 and the eigenvectors @xmath49 of the hessian matrix of the system .",

    "the diffusive dynamics of the system , however , is not influenced by all modes .",

    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : ei ] numerical results for @xmath57 , for the two cases of a double  well and of a `` shoulder '' mode .",
    "we note that all modes with approximately zero eigenvalue , which are responsible for the observed peak in @xmath50 around @xmath61 , turn out to be shoulder modes .",
    "for each unstable eigenvalue @xmath7 we have displaced the particle positions by an amounty @xmath62 along the eigenvector @xmath49 ; the eigenvector is normalized so that @xmath60 gives the total squared displacement of all particles .",
    "the dependence of the energy of the system @xmath63 on @xmath59 allows one to discriminate between double ",
    "well modes and shoulder modes , as illustrated in the figure for two typical cases .",

    "[ fig : transition_density ] , the average distance @xmath65 separating two energy minima in phase space and the corresponding average energy barrier @xmath66 , increase monotonically with density .",
    "in particular , these quantities are therefore not identical for the two states @xmath26 and @xmath27 , suggesting that they are at most weakly correlated with the dynamics .",
    "the figure ( bottom row ) also show that @xmath67 is approximately gaussian distributed , while @xmath68 has a roughly exponential distribution .",
    "we already know the averages of the two distributions are different for @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and accordingly also the distributions themselves are quite distinct .",
