    "s_-wave symmetry superconducting gap@xcite suggests that the superconductivity is electron - phonon mediated .",
    "however , several experimental and theoretical techniques implicate different groups of phonons and electrons are responsible for the superconductivity.@xcite    the adiabatic born - oppenheimer approximation , in which electrons are assumed to instantaneously respond to the motion of the ions , has been widely applied within the framework of density functional theory ( dft ) to predict the phonon frequencies in metals .",
    "@xcite despite this approximation not being theoretically justified , the discrepancies introduced are usually small @xmath5 1%.@xcite however , a much larger effect can be observed provided @xmath6 , @xcite where @xmath7 is the phonon wavevector , @xmath8 is the fermi velocity , and @xmath9 is the phonon frequency .",
    "graphene and materials composed of graphene layers typically have small @xmath8 perpendicular to the graphene sheets .",
    "this makes these systems ideal to observe non - adiabatic effects .",
    "weak non - adiabatic effects have already been observed in metals such as osmium,@xcite graphene,@xcite graphite,@xcite and cnts.@xcite graphite intercalation compounds ( gics ) provide an ideal opportunity to examine phonons within the heavily electron - doped graphene sheets in these compounds , where the increased electronic density of states at the fermi surface should make these effects more significant .",
    ".[tab : tcvsd]the values of @xmath10 and the @xmath11 for the gics under consideration.@xcite [ cols=\"<,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the trend in the c@xmath12 modes to soften from bac@xmath0 , src@xmath0 , ybc@xmath0 , to cac@xmath0 clearly depends on @xmath10 rather than the intercalant mass .",
    "we propose that by increasing @xmath10 charge is transferred out of the @xmath1 band depopulating the dirac cones .",
    "as the @xmath1 band is anti - bonding filling it with electrons destabilizes the bonds causing the softening of the phonons , thus these modes are sensitive to charge transfer .",

    "predict c@xmath12 modes soften considerably when charge is transferred into the @xmath1 states in jellium intercalated graphite.@xcite the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : puckeringmodes ] compares the peak values to adiabatic dft calculations.@xcite theory predicts that the difference between @xmath13 and @xmath14 is due to intra - band electron - phonon scattering , as inter - band process contribute equally to @xmath13 and @xmath14.@xcite given that the experimental values are close to @xmath13 , and assuming that the @xmath6 condition is fulfilled , this agreement shows that there is very little renormalization of these modes due to intra - band transitions .",
    "in addition the line - widths of these modes are relatively small and , within the experimental errors , show no trends with @xmath10 .",
    "the strong doping sensitivity of the c@xmath12 modes means that the experimental frequency can be used , in conjunction with dft , to infer a bulk value of the charge transfer .",
    "the experimental value for cac@xmath0 of @xmath15 is close to the dft prediction of 433@xmath3.@xcite in this model 0.20 electron per c atom are found in the @xmath1 states , which is close to the arpes derived value of 0.22.@xcite this supports the view that the charge transfer in the surface layers probed in angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) is representative of the bulk , and shows that these techniques are consistent in this regard .",
    "the charge transfer dependence proposed here also explains the series of gics csc@xmath16 , rbc@xmath16 to kc@xmath16,@xcite which show a similar trend .",
    "the gradient of these effects is similar , but the overall values are different , since in xc@xmath16 gics ( where x = intercalant ) the charge transfer is less .",
    "we also note that in xc@xmath16 gics the c@xmath12 mode is folded from @xmath17 in the graphite brillouin zone , whereas for ic@xmath0 gics the mode is folded from @xmath18 , which is at slightly lower energy .",
    "the @xmath19 values shown in table [ tab : bbmodes ] show no dependence on intercalant mass : these phonons only sample the environment of the ( doped ) graphene planes .",
    "these values are all significantly different to the values predicted using dft @xcite with the adiabatic approximation @xmath20 ( see table [ tab : bbmodes ] ) .",
    "in fact , the values are closer to the completely non - adiabatic limit @xmath14 , which demonstrates that non - adiabatic effects are essential to understand these phonon energies .",
    "the degree of non - adiabaticity , may be estimated by @xmath21 which increases as charge is transferred to the @xmath1 states in bac@xmath0 , src@xmath0 to cac@xmath0 . despite the similarity in @xmath19 , @xmath22 varies significantly increasing in the order bac@xmath0 , src@xmath0 @xmath2 ybc@xmath0 to cac@xmath0",
    ". this is indicative of a decrease in phonon lifetime as charge is transferred into the @xmath1 states .",
    "the trends observed when doping the @xmath1 states by changing the intercalant atom in gics are different to those measured in graphene and metallic cnts at the much lower doping levels accessed by electrostatic gating.@xcite these systems show an increase in phonon energy and a decrease in @xmath22 with electron - doping .",
    "however , different effects are present in the high doping case of the gics because the kohn anomaly which exists near @xmath7 = 0 in graphene @xcite is displaced to finite @xmath7 and the @xmath1 band is altered and is accompanied by other intercalant - related bands.@xcite    within saitta et al.s theory @xmath19 should fall in between the completely adiabatic limit @xmath13 and the completely non adiabatic limit @xmath14 .",
    "the electron scattering rate @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the electron momentum - relaxation time controls were @xmath19 falls in between these limits . for @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath13",
    "we find @xmath19 @xmath27 @xmath13 and for @xmath25 @xmath28 @xmath13 the system becomes fully non - adiabatic and @xmath19 @xmath27 @xmath14 .",
    "we observe no systematic trend in @xmath25 , and we find the values are highly sensitive to any small errors in the experimental and theoretical frequencies .",
    "it is therefore difficult to use this method to accurately extract the electron scattering rate .",
    "it is however , possible to rearrange saitta et al.s equations for derive the electron - phonon scattering induced linewidth @xmath29 the derived values of @xmath30 account for the trend in @xmath22 to increase going from bac@xmath0 , src@xmath0 to cac@xmath0 , but significantly underestimate its absolute value .",
    "the @xmath22 values reported here should be the intrinsic linewidth in these gics , with a negligible disorder contribution , as these results are reproducible in samples produced from madagascan flake graphite and hopg .",
    "this is despite hopg having a crystallite size of @xmath4 1@xmath31 , far smaller than the @xmath4 100@xmath31 in madagascan flake graphite .",
    "an order of magnitude calculation can be performed to estimate the length scales which correspond to the observed @xmath22 .",
    "the c@xmath32 modes in these gics have a typical lifetime of @xmath33 @xmath2 15 periods and stretch bonds over @xmath4 5 , which implies the atomic motion is correlated over only @xmath4 80 .",
    "madagascan flake based cac@xmath0 and ybc@xmath0 samples made in the same way as the samples used in this study have ordered regions of @xmath4 50@xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , the mean distance between scattering centers , as estimated from the low temperature resistivity is @xmath4 1000.@xcite disorder broadening should therefore have an insignificant role here .",
    "anharmonic effects are also unlikely to cause such a large linewidth.@xcite we therefore suggest that theory underestimates the degree of electron - phonon interaction in these compounds.@xcite    these results also have implications for the debate outlined in the introduction ( sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] ) regarding which phonons and electrons are most relevant for the superconductivity in src@xmath0 , ybc@xmath0 and cac@xmath0 .",
    "the trend uncovered that @xmath11 increases when charge is transferred into the graphene layers provides strong evidence that the c phonons and the @xmath1 electrons are involved in the superconductivity .",
    "this is very difficult to reconcile with the isotope effect measurements @xcite and early theory,@xcite which suggest that superconductivity is predominately due to the intercalant atoms .",
    "our work supports the assertion that the c atoms are relevant , either the c@xmath12 modes @xcite or the c@xmath32 modes.@xcite",
    "in conclusion , we present phonon measurements of bac@xmath0 , src@xmath0 , ybc@xmath0 , and cac@xmath0 .",
    "raman spectroscopy is employed to monitor the systematic changes in both the phonons and the electron - phonon interaction in the graphene sheets as @xmath10 is varied by changing the intercalant atom .",
    "the c@xmath12 phonons are found to soften in the order bac@xmath0 , src@xmath0 , ybc@xmath0 to cac@xmath0 indicative of change transfer into the @xmath1 states as @xmath10 is reduced .",
    "concurrent with this charge transfer is a large increase in @xmath11 . while the out - of - plane carbon mode is well described within the born - oppenheimer approximation , the in - plane carbon mode is not .",
    "we demonstrate that the in - plane carbon modes show strong non - adiabatic effects , which lead to phonon frequencies that are considerably higher than the adiabatic prediction . as the charge transfer to the @xmath1 states increases ,",
    "these effects get stronger causing an increasing discrepancy between the adiabatic prediction and experimental frequency and an increase in the phonon linewidth . theoretical work ( ref .   ) anticipates the relevance of the non adiabatic effects in these gics .",
    "however , our work provides new evidence that the degree of electron - phonon interaction for this mode is stronger than the current theory predicts .",
