    "we consider the problem of constructing appropriate non - discrete models on bounded domains from given discrete volume data .",
    "the development of such trivariate models is relevant because it is the theoretical basis for many applications , such as scientific visualization , computer graphics , medical imaging , numerical simulation , seismic applications , etc . indeed",
    ", volume data sets typically represent some kind of density acquired by special devices that often require structured input data , so that the samples are arranged on a regular three - dimensional grid .",
    "it is important to underline that we need to construct models defined on bounded domains of @xmath1 , because we have at our disposal a finite number of volumetric data .",
    "in classical approaches the underlying mathematical models use local trivariate tensor - product polynomial splines , defined on bounded domains as linear combinations of univariate b - spline products .",
    "if we require a certain smoothness along the coordinate axes , such splines can be of high coordinate degree , that can create unwanted oscillations and often require ( approximate ) derivative data at certain prescribed points .",
    "these reasons raise the natural problem of constructing alternative smooth spline models , that use only data values on the volumetric grid and simultaneously approximate smooth functions as well as their derivatives .",
    "moreover , in order to avoid unwanted oscillations , it is desirable that polynomial sections have total degree , instead of the coordinate degree , that is typical of tensor product schemes .    a possible 3d spline model , beyond the classical tensor product schemes , is represented by blending sums of univariate and bivariate @xmath2 quadratic spline quasi - interpolants ( see e.g. @xcite ) , defined on a bounded domain , partitioned into vertical prisms with triangular horizontal sections . in this case the approximation order is three , as for triquadratic splines , but the degree of the piecewise polynomials is only four , instead of six .    in order to have smooth splines of lower total degree ,",
    "other methods based on trivariate splines defined on type-6 tetrahedral partitions of bounded domains have been proposed . in literature @xcite , quasi - interpolating schemes , based on either quadratic or cubic",
    "@xmath2 splines on type-6 tetrahedral partitions , are described and the piecewise polynomials are directly determined by setting their bernstein - bzier coefficients ( bb - coefficients ) to appropriate combinations of the data values .",
    "the above splines yield approximation order two .",
    "in this paper we propose and analyse new quasi - interpolating spline schemes , on type-6 tetrahedral partitions of bounded domains , with higher @xmath0 smoothness and approximation order four .",
    "they are expressed as linear combination of scaled translates of the trivariate @xmath0 quartic box spline @xmath3 @xcite , defined on such a partition , and local functionals .",
    "these functionals are defined as linear combinations of data values .",
    "such quasi - interpolating operators are exact on the space @xmath4 of trivariate polynomials of total degree at most three and , therefore , yield approximation order four .",
    "we recall that a fundamental property of such quasi - interpolants ( abbr .",
    "qis ) is that they do not need the solution of huge systems of linear equations , with respect to the approximation by interpolating operators .",
    "this is very effective in the 3d space .    among the different techniques that can be used to define qis with such properties , here we decide to construct operators of near - best type ( i.e. with coefficient functionals obtained by minimizing an upper bound for their infinity norm ) , motivated by the good results obtained in @xcite for the univariate and bivariate settings",
    ". the main problem in their construction consists in finding the coefficient functionals associated with boundary generators , i.e. scaled translate box splines with supports not completely inside the domain .",
    "we remark that trivariate splines with @xmath0 smoothness can be used for constructing curvature continuous surfaces by tracing their zero sets .",
    "here is an outline of the paper . in section [ spl ]",
    "we define the space @xmath5 of @xmath0 quartic splines on a type-6 tetrahedral partition @xmath6 of a parallelepiped @xmath7 and present its properties . in section [ qi ] , we construct near - best spline qis and we provide norm and error estimates for smooth functions . finally , in section [ num ] , in order to illustrate the approximation properties of the proposed quasi - interpolants , some numerical tests are presented and compared with those obtained by some other known trivariate spline quasi - interpolants .",
    "we also provide some examples with real world volume data .",
    "a box spline is specified by a set of direction vectors that determines the shape of its support and also its smoothness properties .",
    "we consider the set of seven direction vectors of @xmath8 , spanning @xmath1 @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10    such direction vectors subdivide @xmath1 into the so - called type-6 tetrahedral partition , obtained from a given cube partition of the space ( see fig .",
    "[ part]@xmath11 ) , by subdividing each cube into 24 tetrahedra ( see fig .",
    "[ part]@xmath12 ) .",
    "since cuts with six planes are required to subdivide the cubes in this way , the resulting tetrahedral partition is called type-6 tetrahedral partition .     cube partition . @xmath12 uniform type-6 tetrahedral partition , obtained by subdividing each cube into 24 tetrahedra , height=143 ]    @xmath11     cube partition . @xmath12",

    "thus the polynomial pieces defined over each tetrahedron are of degree four and they are joined with @xmath0 smoothness .    the support of @xmath3 is the truncated rhombic dodecahedron centered at the point @xmath19 and contained in the cube @xmath20\\times[-2,3]\\times[0,5]$ ] ( see fig .",

    "therefore , in order to have all data points inside or on the boundary of @xmath7 , we project them on @xmath49 , obtaining a new set that we still call @xmath88 .",
    "we remark that @xmath89 , defined in ( [ dset ] ) .",
    "then , for the construction of @xmath48 , we impose the exactness of @xmath62 on @xmath4 , getting twenty conditions ( or less than twenty in case of symmetry ) .",
    "thus , we choose a starting value for @xmath87 , we construct a scheme for the coefficient functional based on the data point set @xmath88 and containing at least twenty unknown parameters ( or less than twenty in case of symmetry ) .",
    "we solve the resulting linear system and , in case of free parameters , we minimize the norm @xmath90 .    in order to reduce such a norm ,",
    "we increase the value of @xmath87 and we repeat the process above explained .",
    "we describe this method in detail in the case @xmath91 .",
    "we impose @xmath92 , for all monomials of @xmath4 , i.e. for @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 . due to the symmetry of the support of @xmath113 with respect to the plane @xmath114 , we have only 13 conditions to impose .",

    "then , we solve the system and we minimize @xmath121 . in the first row of table [ tabnorm ] the values of @xmath121 for @xmath124 are shown .",
    "we notice that @xmath121 reduces when more data points are added , i.e. for increasing values for @xmath87 , but this reduction slows down as @xmath87 increases .",
    "using the same logic , we get the other coefficient functionals : we start with an initial @xmath88 such that the system has solution and , in order to reduce @xmath125 , we consider increasing values of @xmath87 . for each value",
    "we solve the corresponding system and we minimize the norm @xmath125 .",
    "since a large number of qis can be constructed , we have to choose a specific @xmath87 for each coefficient functional in ( [ oqi ] ) . for this choice",
    "we have taken into account the following remarks : since the norm reduction slows down as @xmath87 increases , we have to strike a balance between @xmath87 and the value @xmath125 , in order to keep the data points in a neighbourhood of the support of @xmath59 .",
