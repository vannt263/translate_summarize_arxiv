    "we begin with the t - odd function @xmath65 , which is quite relevant for fragmentation into transversely polarized hyperons ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "it receives nonzero contributions from diagrams ( e ) and ( f ) in fig .",
    "[ f:2 ] , and the result reads @xmath101 with @xmath102 as given in eq .",
    "( [ e : coll_res1 ] ) .",
    "one finds that for @xmath65 a sum rule of the type  ( [ e : sr2 ] ) does not hold .",
    "this can , for instance , be shown by focusing on the ultraviolet divergent part of the @xmath21-integral . to be more specific",
    ", one finds @xmath103 where @xmath104 is an upper cutoff for the @xmath105-integration .",
    "in contrast to the collins function , for which fragmentation into a quark and fragmentation into a pion show up , for @xmath65 the fragmentation into a quark is not compensated by another term .",
    "the t - even functions @xmath66 and @xmath67 can be computed to @xmath71 on the basis of diagram ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ f:1 ] leading to @xmath106 again , by just focusing on the ultraviolet divergent part of the @xmath21-integral , one also readily verifies that for these two ffs a sum rule of the type  ( [ e : sr2 ] ) can not exist .",
    "explicit calculation provides @xmath107",
    "in this note , momentum sum rules for fragmentation functions have been studied by performing both a model - independent analysis as well as explicit model calculations . in particular , we have provided a general field - theoretical proof of the st sum rule  @xcite for the collins function @xmath1  @xcite in qcd .",
    "the existing derivation of the st sum rule was merely based on intuitive arguments about conservation of transverse momentum in the fragmentation process  @xcite . in this respect , there is a strong similarity between the st sum rule and the longitudinal momentum sum rule for the unpolarized fragmentation function @xmath0 :  they are both intuitive , but their general proof in qcd is more involved  @xcite .",
    "the same statement also applies to the so - called burkardt sum rule  @xcite for the transverse momentum dependent sivers parton distribution  @xcite .    in the literature",
    "it was suggested that the st sum rule should also hold for the three additional transverse momentum dependent ffs @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "however , here we have shown that the general proof of the st sum rule can not be extended to these cases .",
    "we have also demonstrated that , in the light - cone gauge , the proof of the longitudinal momentum sum rule for @xmath0 is not spoiled by the relatively recently discovered transversely running wilson lines in the fragmentation correlator .",
    "we have exploited a simple self - consistent quark - pion coupling model in order to explicitly verify / falsify the momentum sum rules .",
    "though the model does not know about all the complexities of qcd , it nevertheless can be used for interesting cross checks .",
    "we have been able to verify the sum rule for @xmath0 as well as the st sum rule for the collins function @xmath1 to lowest nontrivial order in the coupling constant .",
    "on the other hand , we have shown explicitly that the st sum rule does not hold for the aforementioned additional three ffs .",
