    "within the last few years the unique environment for investigating new physics using forward proton tagging at the lhc has become fully appreciated , see for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "of particular interest is the ` central exclusive ' higgs boson production @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath12 signs are used to denote the presence of large rapidity gaps ; here we will simply describe such processes as ` exclusive ' , with ` double - diffractive ' production being implied . in these exclusive processes there is no hadronic activity between the outgoing protons and the decay products of the central system .",
    "the predictions for exclusive production are obtained by calculating the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : h ] using perturbative qcd @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have to calculate and include the probability that the rapidity gaps are not populated by secondary hadrons from the underlying event @xcite .",
    "= 0.4    there are three reasons why central exclusive production is so attractive .",
    "first , if the outgoing protons remain intact and scatter through small angles then , to a very good approximation , the primary active di - gluon system obeys a @xmath4 , cp - even selection rule @xcite . here",
    "@xmath13 is the projection of the total angular momentum along the proton beam axis .",
    "this selection rule readily permits a clean determination of the quantum numbers of the observed higgs - like resonance which will be dominantly produced in a scalar state . secondly , because the process is exclusive , the energy loss of the outgoing protons is directly related to the mass of the central system , allowing a potentially excellent mass resolution , irrespective of the decay mode of the produced particle .",
    "will be of order @xmath14 for a @xmath15  gev central system , assuming both protons are detected at 420 m from the interaction point @xcite . ] and , thirdly , a signal - to - background ratio of order 1 ( or even better ) is achievable , even with a moderate luminosity of 30  fb@xmath16 @xcite . in some mssm higgs scenarios central exclusive production",
    "provides an opportunity for lineshape analysing @xcite and offers a way for direct observation of a cp - violating signal in the higgs sector @xcite .",
    "the analysis in @xcite was focused primarily on light sm and mssm higgs production , with the higgs decaying to 2 @xmath17jets .",
    "the potentially copious @xmath17jet ( qcd ) background is controlled by a combination of the spin - parity selection rules @xcite , which strongly suppress leading - order @xmath18 production , and the mass resolution from the forward proton detectors . the missing mass resolution is especially critical in controlling the background , since poor resolution would allow more background events into the mass window around the resonance . assuming a mass window @xmath19  gev",
    ", it is estimated that 11 signal events , with a signal - to - background ratio of order 1 , can be achieved with a luminosity of 30 fb@xmath16 in the @xmath18 decay channel @xcite .",
    "the situation becomes exceptionally favourable , with predicted higgs signal - to - background ratios in excess of 20 @xcite . in this particular case",
    "the tagged proton mode may well be _ the _ discovery channel .",
    "] whilst the @xmath18 channel is theoretically very attractive , allowing direct access to the dominant decay mode of the light higgs boson , there are some basic problems which render it challenging from an experimental perspective , see @xcite for more details .",
    "first , it relies heavily on the quality of the mass resolution from the proton taggers to suppress the background . secondly , triggering on the relatively low - mass dijet signature of the @xmath20 events is a challenge for the level 1 triggers of both atlas and cms . and ,",
    "thirdly , this measurement requires double @xmath17tagging , with a corresponding price to pay for tagging efficiencies . in ref .",
    "@xcite , attention was turned to the @xmath21 decay mode of the light higgs boson , and above the 2 @xmath1 threshold , the @xmath22 decay mode .",
    "decay is very low  less than @xmath23 of the @xmath6 rate  and we shall not consider this channel further here . ]",
    "this channel does not suffer from any of the above problems : suppression of the dominant backgrounds does not rely so strongly on the mass resolution of the detectors , and , certainly , in the semi - leptonic decay channel of the @xmath22 system level 1 triggering is not a problem .",
    "the advantages of forward proton tagging are , however , still explicit . even for the double leptonic decay channel ( i.e. with two leptons and two final state neutrinos )",
    ", the mass resolution will be very good , and of course observation of the higgs in the double tagged channel immediately establishes its quantum numbers .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the mass resolution should improve with increasing higgs mass @xcite .",
    "moreover , the semileptonic ` trigger cocktail ' may allow the combination of signals not only from @xmath6 decays but also from the @xmath24 , @xmath25 and even the semileptonic @xmath17decay channels .",
    "the central exclusive production cross section for the standard model higgs boson was calculated in @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tanbeta ] we show the cross section for the process @xmath26 as a function of the higgs mass @xmath27 at the lhc",
    ". the increasing branching ratio to @xmath28 ( from @xmath29 at @xmath30  gev to @xmath31 at @xmath32  gev ) as @xmath27 increases ( see for example @xcite ) compensates for the falling central exclusive production cross section . for comparison",
    ", we also show the cross section times branching ratio for @xmath33 . here , and in what follows , we use version 3.0 of the hdecay code @xcite . for reference purposes , the cross sections in fig .",
    "[ fig : tanbeta ] are normalised in such a way that @xmath34  fb for @xmath30  gev .",
    "note also that nowadays there is renewed interest in mssm scenarios with low @xmath35 .",
    "this is because the most recent value of the top quark mass weakens the low @xmath35 exclusion bounds from lep ( see for example @xcite ) , and the experimental coverage of this range of the mssm parameter space becomes more attractive . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tanbeta ] we show the results for @xmath36 .",
    "evidently the expected central exclusive diffractive production yield is promising in the low @xmath35 region .",
    "= 0.8    experimentally , events with two @xmath1 bosons in the final state fall into 3 broad categories  fully - hadronic , semi - leptonic and fully - leptonic  depending on the decay modes of the @xmath1 s .",
    "events in which at least one of the @xmath1s decays in either the electron or muon channel are by far the simplest , and ref .",
    "@xcite focuses mainly on these semi- and fully - leptonic modes . as mentioned above , one of the attractive features of the @xmath22 channel is the absence of a relatively large irreducible background , _ cf . _",
    "the large central exclusive @xmath18 qcd background in the case of @xmath20 , suppression of which relies strongly on the experimental missing mass resolution and di - jet identification .",
    "the primary exclusive backgrounds in the case of the @xmath22 channel can be divided into two broad categories :    1 .",
    "central production of a @xmath21 pair @xmath37 from either the ( a ) @xmath38 or ( b ) @xmath39 subprocess .",
    "the @xmath1-strahlung process @xmath40 originating in the @xmath41 subprocess , where the @xmath42 is ` faked ' by the two quarks .",
    "here the notation @xmath43 indicates that each active gluon comes from a colour - singlet @xmath44channel ( pomeron ) exchange and that the di - gluon state obeys the @xmath4 , parity - even selection rule .",
    "as shown in @xcite , over a wide region of higgs masses the photon - photon backgrounds are strongly suppressed if we require that the final leptons and jets are central and impose cuts on the transverse momenta of the protons in the taggers . using the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , we find that the qcd quark - box - diagram contribution from the @xmath39 subprocess is also very small , on the level of @xmath14 of the signal yield .",
    "the most important background therefore comes from the second category above , i.e. from the @xmath1-strahlung process exemplified by the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : wqq ] .",
    "here we have to take into account the @xmath4 projection of this amplitude , which requires a calculation of the individual helicity amplitudes .",
    "this can be done , for example , using the spinor technique of ref .",
    "the primary aim of this paper is to investigate the salient properties of this potentially important background process .",
    "the tree - level @xmath45 process @xmath3 is one of many processes that contribute to @xmath5  jet production at hadron colliders , and as such it has been studied intensively as part of the ` qcd ' background to @xmath46 , @xmath47 etc .",
    "the scattering amplitude was first calculated almost twenty years ago in ref .",
    "@xcite , using the new ( at that time ) spinor techniques that were developed for multiparton tree - level scattering amplitudes .",
    "nowadays , all the spin- and colour - summed amplitudes contributing to inclusive @xmath5  jet production are easily obtained from automated tree - level matrix element software packages such as madgraph @xcite .",
    "however in the present context we are specifically interested in the @xmath4 , colour - singlet projection of the @xmath3 process .",
    "it is difficult to extract such projections from the standard packages , and so we have performed the calculation from first principles using the original techniques of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare the structure of the inclusive and projected amplitudes . for the former ,",
    "there are a total of 8 feynman diagrams , two involving the triple - gluon vertex ( @xmath48 ) and six diagrams corresponding to the six different permutations of the three gauge bosons attached to the quark line .",
    "two of the latter are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wqq ] .",
    "three of the six diagrams correspond to an interchange of the two gluons , and so the sum and difference of these amplitude triplets ( labelled @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) contribute to even and odd colour factors respectively .",
    "schematically , then , we have for the inclusive case : @xmath51 where the labels @xmath52 etc .",
    "are the helicities of the incoming gluons ( the quark helicities being fixed once the sign of the @xmath1 boson is specified ) , and the even and odd colour factors are @xmath53 \\nonumber \\\\ 12 & = & { \\rm tr}[(t^at^b - t^bt^a)(t^bt^a - t^at^b)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the diagram with the @xmath54channel gluon contributes only to the colour - odd , @xmath4 amplitude . in the fully inclusive @xmath5  jet calculation , the two spin contributions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : amp1 ] ) are of course added together .",
    "for the background to exclusive @xmath6 production , fig .",
    "[ fig : h ] , we need the @xmath4 , colour - singlet projection : @xmath55 where now the colour factor is @xmath56\\ ] ] the colour - octet @xmath54channel gluon diagrams ( @xmath57 ) no longer contribute to the @xmath4 amplitude .",
    "note also that the @xmath52 and @xmath58 spin components can interfere in the overall amplitude squared .",
    "this is because in the case of exclusive central diffractive production , the amplitudes ( rather than the cross sections ) should be averaged over the helicities @xmath52 or @xmath58 of the incoming gluons , see for example @xcite .",
    "= 0.4    in the following section we present some numerical results based on the above calculations .",
    "= 0.7    = 0.7    = 0.7    the @xmath59 cross section is obtained by integrating the matrix element squared of the previous section over an appropriate region of three - body phase space .",
    "however care must be taken in avoiding collinear singularities .",
    "these occur when either one or both of the incoming gluons splits into a collinear @xmath60 pair .",
    "of course in this case the final - state ( zero transverse momentum ) quarks would not be registered as jets in the detector . in order to have observable jets and to suppress the collinear logarithmic singularities",
    ", we impose the pseudorapidity cut ( @xmath61 ) on the final - state quarks . with these minimal cuts ,",
    "we obtain a finite background cross section with which to compare the higgs signal .",
    "figure  [ fig : ggww ] shows the jet - jet mass distribution @xmath62 for the inclusive and @xmath4 , colour - singlet projected @xmath3 process at @xmath63  gev , a typical value for the higgs mass .",
    "two families of fermions are summed over in the final state ( i.e. the quarks are either @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 or @xmath67 ) and both @xmath68 and @xmath69 configurations are included .",
    "evidently the @xmath4 , colour - singlet projection suppresses the cross section by about a factor of 2 for these kinematics . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ggwwtot ] we show the total @xmath59 cross section as a function of the gluon - gluon centre - of - mass energy @xmath70 .",
    "the dashed line is the contribution of the interference between the @xmath52 and @xmath58 gluon helicity amplitudes in eq .",
    "( [ eq : amp2 ] ) .",
    "this is evidently a very small effect for these kinematics .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : ggwwmjj ] shows the jet - jet ( @xmath60 ) invariant mass distribution for different values of @xmath70 .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : ggwwtot ] we see that the @xmath3 total cross section is about @xmath71  pb for @xmath72  gev , rising to 10.6  pb at @xmath73  gev and then decreasing slowly for higher energies .",
    "when comparing to the higgs @xmath74 or @xmath22 signal , this background cross section should be multiplied by the phase space factor @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the mass window over which we collect the signal , and by the corresponding gluon luminosity at @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "assuming that @xmath78 we finally arrive at the background cross section at @xmath79  tev of about 1.7  fb for @xmath80  gev .",
    "this is a ` maximal ' background cross section in the sense that the only cuts on the final - state jets  apart from the mass - window requirement  are the weak rapidity cuts @xmath81 imposed in the jet - jet centre of mass system .",
    "further laboratory - frame cuts on jet and lepton rapidity and transverse momentum will further reduce the background cross section , but will of course also reduce the signal , though to a lesser extent . comparing with fig .",
    "[ fig : tanbeta ] , we see that the @xmath82 background cross section is about a factor of two larger than the standard model higgs signal should be reduced slightly to take into account the @xmath83 branching ratio and the rapidity acceptance of the jets .",
    "] at this value of @xmath27 .",
    "it might appear that the qcd background could be further reduced by only selecting the subset of events with a rather large two - jet mass @xmath84 , in order to mimic the @xmath85 signal .",
    "however as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hmjj ] , when @xmath86 and one of the @xmath1 bosons is off - mass - shell , the @xmath87 distribution is peaked _ below _ the edge of phase space at @xmath88 .",
    "the reason for this ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) is that below the nominal @xmath22 threshold the three - body phase space factor compensates the variation of the @xmath1 breit - wigner distribution in the tail .",
    "indeed , the @xmath87 distribution actually vanishes at @xmath89 ( where here @xmath27 denotes the c.m.s .",
    "energy of the @xmath21 system ) . on the other hand , for a low mass @xmath90",
    "the variation of the breit - wigner factor is controlled mainly by the difference @xmath91 .",
    "because of this , the @xmath87 mass distribution becomes quite wide , and the peak is shifted below the edge of phase space by an amount of order @xmath92 . comparing the signal and background jet - jet invariant mass distributions , figs .",
    "[ fig : hmjj ] and [ fig : ggwwmjj ] , we see that while the s / b ratio could be improved slightly by imposing a minimum @xmath93 , the loss of signal events would not lead to any overall improvement in the statistical significance of the signal .",
    "note that we have not investigated further optimisation procedures , such as the cuts on the final - state lepton angles and azimuthal correlations between the quark jets , which may further improve the signal - to - background ratio .",
    "= 0.7    it is obvious from figs .",
    "[ fig : ggwwmjj ] and [ fig : hmjj ] that above the @xmath22 threshold the situation becomes more favourable , since the background contribution can now be reduced by requiring the invariant mass of the di - quark system to be close to @xmath94 . moreover , at higher higgs masses the mass resolution of the proton taggers is expected to improve @xcite .",
    "returning to the case when @xmath86 , we have so far concentrated on the case when it is the _ off - shell _ @xmath42 that decays hadronically , the on - shell @xmath1 decaying leptonically .",
    "there will of course be an equal number of signal events when this situation is reversed and the @xmath42 decays leptonically . is rough @xmath95 , with the mixed channel split evenly between the case when the @xmath1 or the @xmath42 decays leptonically . ]",
    "therefore apart from around the threshold region @xmath96 , the @xmath93 distribution for the full @xmath97 sample of the signal will have a double - peak structure , corresponding to the superposition of a breit - wigner distribution peaked around @xmath98 with a broader distribution peaked at lower mass , see fig .",
    "[ fig : hmjj ] .",
    "the qcd @xmath1-strahlung process calculated above is only a background to the former component of the signal .",
    "production with @xmath99 and @xmath100 , but this will be very small . ] the only other potentially significant background contributions for the @xmath98 case come from the photon - photon fusion @xmath38 subprocess and from the gluon - gluon fusion @xmath101 subprocess mediated by a quark loop . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the former ( @xmath102 ) contribution can be strongly ( about 10 times ) reduced by imposing cuts on the forward proton transverse momenta , @xmath103  mev / c . using the results of @xcite , we estimate that the qcd quark box - diagram @xmath101 contribution is very small , on the level of @xmath14 of the signal yield .",
    "therefore , the statistical significance for these type of events is very high : for events with @xmath104  mev / c the expected signal - to - background ratio @xmath105 is of the order of 10 .",
    "this makes the channel with the leptonic @xmath42-decay especially attractive when @xmath86 .",
    "we expect that a detailed monte carlo simulation of both signal and background events of this type would lead to a set of signal - enhancing experimental cuts , reflecting the specific kinematics of these processes .    in summary ,",
    "we have considered in detail the exclusive production and decay to @xmath22 or @xmath42 of a higgs boson in conjunction with two forward protons at the lhc .",
    "we have focused on the @xmath106 final state , which constitutes just less than half the signal . for @xmath86 ,",
    "there are two distinct scenarios in which either the @xmath1 or the @xmath42 decays leptonically . for the former",
    ", we identified and calculated the qcd background , showing it to be of similar magnitude to the ( standard model ) higgs boson signal .",
    "we expect that the situation could be improved somewhat by optimising the cuts on the final - state particles . in the second scenario in which the @xmath42 decays leptonically ,",
    "the background is expected to be very small .",
    "overall , then this process offers a promising way of detecting the higgs boson , either in the standard model or in particular supersymmetric extensions .",
