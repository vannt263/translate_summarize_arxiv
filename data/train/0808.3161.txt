    "the star forming region known as w40 consists of three interrelated components .",
    "first , there is the cold molecular cloud , which is designated using galactic coordinates as g28.8 + 3.5 , following @xcite .",
    "this dark cloud has an angular extent on the order of one degree , and is centered around a dense molecular core with a diameter of approximately @xmath0 , identified as tgu  279-p7 in the recent extinction atlas of @xcite .",
    "adjacent to this molecular cloud is the large blister hii region denoted as w40 @xcite , and also labeled as s64 by @xcite , as rcw  174 by rodgers , campbell , & whiteoak ( 1960 ) , or lbn  90 in the lynds ( @xcite ) catalog of bright nebulae .",
    "the w40 hii region is centered on j2000 coordinates @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and has a diameter of @xmath3 .",
    "the space between the hot , ionized hii region and the cold molecular cloud is marked by a thin cii region and an accompanying neutral interface @xcite .",
    "lastly , the w40 region hosts an embedded stellar cluster that is dominated by three bright ir sources @xcite .",
    "these bright ob stars are the primary excitation sources for the w40 hii region @xcite and show evidence for substantial circumstellar envelopes @xcite . the w40 cluster is heavily obscured along our line of sight by the surrounding molecular cloud , which provides @xmath4 magnitudes of visual extinction throughout , and as much as @xmath5 mag at the dense center @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : dss_2mass ] shows the w40 region in the optical from the digitized sky survey and in the infrared from the 2mass survey .",
    "the distance to w40 has not yet been determined to any satisfactory precision .",
    "measurements of the h109@xmath6 atomic recombination line at 0.7 km  s@xmath7 @xcite , the @xmath818 cm oh absorption line at 6.3 km  s@xmath7 @xcite and the 21 cm hi absorption line along the line of sight at 7.2 km  s@xmath7 @xcite collectively suggest a rough kinematic distance estimate of 300 - 900 pc based on the assumption that the cloud is in circular motion about the galactic center .",
    "estimates based on the radio / ir continuum of w40 s stellar component allow for a similar range from 400 pc @xcite to 700 pc @xcite . using oh line measurements with a unique distance determination technique , @xcite calculated a distance of 600 pc .    adopting a conservative mean of 600 pc places w40 at a distance of 37 pc above the galactic plane .",
    "the dense central region of the molecular cloud is then @xmath9 pc in diameter , and the width of the hii region measures @xmath10 pc .",

    "after the initial discoveries of the w40 radio emission nebula and its associated hii region around 1960 , subsequent radio detections were recorded over a wide range of frequencies . by the early 1970s",
    "the radio spectrum was well - constrained from 408 mhz to 5 ghz .",
    "table [ tab : radio_obs ] summarizes the radio observations of the hii region s free - free continuum and carbon recombination lines in the cii shell .",
    "the median flux density of the radio continuum in the hii region is 34 jy .",
    "the most detailed radio continuum analysis to date is from the vla observations of @xcite , which show a linear increase in the flux density across the hii region from the surrounding interstellar medium in the ne to the molecular cloud edge in the sw .",
    "their maps also suggest the presence of a @xmath22 shell around the star irs2a .",
    "the tgu  279 molecular cloud has also been extensively mapped at millimeter wavelengths .",
    "these observations are summarized in table [ tab : mm_obs ] .",
    "the properties of the molecular cloud derived from these observations are strongly model - dependent .",

    "zhu , wu , & wei ( 2006 ) measured the mass of the cloud core at the center of the outflow to be 188 or 319 m@xmath25 , depending on the transition used for the estimate .",
    "the larger cloud complex probably has a mass of order @xmath26 .",

    "[ fig : cartoon ]    the first detailed infrared examination of the w40 region was carried out by @xcite .",

    "in addition , the bright ir sources are spatially displaced from the co peak , suggestive of a blister hii region expanding away from the dense molecular cloud core .    in 1982",

    "@xcite took measurements of cn@xmath6 recombination lines in the warm neutral interface between the hot hii region and the cold molecular cloud . fitting a model to their observations",
    ", they were able to constrain the properties of the thin cii shell and surmise that the stimulated cn@xmath6 line emission must be driven by a high background temperature provided by the partially obscured hii region .    with these observations",
    "we may begin to draw a coherent picture of the history and current state of the w40 molecular cloud complex .",
    "star formation in this region was initiated perhaps several million years ago by an external shock which caused a compression of the molecular gas and a distinct shift in the velocity of some of the molecular hydrogen .",
    "the subsequent formation of a number of o and b stars created the hii region , with a center offset by @xmath31 to the northeast of the molecular cloud core .",
