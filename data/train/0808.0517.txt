    "double - barred galaxies are rather common systems in the universe , representing @xmath21/3 of all barred galaxies @xcite .",
    "these structures are mainly seen by surface brightness profile decomposition , which requires not only a bulge and a disk but also two additional components with non - axial symmetry .",
    "the presence of inner bars does not seem to correlate with the morphological type of the host galaxy and there is also no preferred angle between the two structures .",
    "this property suggests that both bars rotate independently , as seen in observations and consistent with numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "inner bars play an important role in the evolution of galaxies as they might transport gas to the central regions , where they may trigger the formation of stars that , in turn , lead to the appearance of new structures such as disk - like components @xcite .",
    "theoretically , this phenomenon can not be achieved with a single bar , since the flow of material would stop before reaching the galactic center ( e.g. at the inner lindblad resonance ) .",
    "the presence of two embedded bars makes it possible and may even help to feed the central agn @xcite .",
    "the study of the orbital make - up of different morphological components in double - barred galaxies is one of the best ways to understand their internal structure and dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , this is a rather complex issue to address as there are three fundamental frequencies for the regular orbits ( i.e. two for the bars and one for the free oscillations ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) instead of the two frequencies as in the case of a single bar .",
    "as a result , they do not have closed and periodic orbits , so @xcite introduced the _ loop _",
    "concept to represent the stable orbits in a double - barred potential .",
    "a more popular approach is the use of numerical simulations to describe the structures seen in real observations , such as in the recent works by @xcite and @xcite . in their simulations , these authors generate long - lived double bars with and without a dissipative component , respectively .",
    "however , most existing observations have relied on long - slit spectroscopy along only a few position angles , which makes the comparison with the models somewhat difficult .",
    "better suited integral - field spectroscopy has generally not been used to observe these systems , with the notable exceptions of @xcite and .    here",
    "we present ` sauron `  integral - field spectroscopy results on the stellar kinematics of four double - barred early - type galaxies .",
    "we will focus on the detailed analysis of the stellar velocity dispersion maps , that reveal a peculiar feature , not seen before , along the extremes of the inner bar .",
    "we present the observational evidence and discuss possible interpretations using numerical simulations . a more complete account of the ionised gas , stellar population properties and supporting numerical simulations will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "integral - field spectroscopic data of four double - barred early - type galaxies were taken with the ` sauron `  spectrograph , attached to the william herschel telescope at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( la palma , spain ) .",
    "the galaxies were selected from the catalog of , so that not only the lengths of the inner bars were a good match to the ` sauron `  field - of - view ( fov ) , but also allowed for enough fov in order to sample the transition region between the two bars .",
    "we deliberately selected early - type galaxies so as to avoid the appearance of complex structures due to the presence of dust , and to make it easier to perform stellar population analysis .",
    "we used the lr mode of ` sauron ` providing a @xmath3 fov with spatial sampling of @xmath4 per lens .",
    "the spectral range covers the domain between 4800 - 5380   .",
    "this setup produces 1431 spectra per pointing over the ` sauron `  fov , with a sampling of 1.1 pixel@xmath1 and a spectral resolution of 3.74  (fwhm ) .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the xsauron package @xcite , following the same procedures outlined in @xcite .",
    "total integration times range between 3 to 4 hours , providing a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath5 at the centers of the galaxies .",
    "additionally , in order to ensure the measurement of reliable stellar kinematics , we spatially binned our final datacubes using the voronoi 2d binning algorithm of @xcite , creating compact bins with a minimum signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath6 ) of @xmath7 per spectral resolution element .",
    "most spectra in the central regions , however , have @xmath6 in excess of @xmath8 , and so remain un - binned .",
    "the stellar kinematics is then extracted as described in @xcite , by fitting the absorption spectrum to a linear combination of the same set of templates . for this purpose",
    "we used the penalized pixel - fitting ( ppxf ) method of @xcite and a well selected subsample of the stellar population models from @xcite , with evenly sampled ages and metallicities .",
    "figure  [ fig : data ] shows the results from the analysis of the datacubes .",
    "the stellar velocity maps look very much like those of non double - barred galaxies and in three out of the four galaxies ( ngc2859 , ngc4725 and ngc5850 ) we find local velocity maxima and minima along the direction of the kinematic major axes , at a few arcseconds from the galaxy centers .",
    "moreover , the @xmath9 maps , not included in this letter , show a clear anticorrelation with the stellar velocities at the locations of these features , supporting the idea that these faster rotating components are kinematically decoupled inner disks @xcite .",
    "since the kinematic major axes are not aligned with the inner bars at these regions , these disks can not be related with the bars .    however , the stellar velocity dispersion maps reveal some interesting features not seen in other morphological types of galaxies .",
    "the values measured are at a maximum at the centers of the galaxies ( as seen in most e / s0 galaxies ) but , instead of smooth negative velocity dispersion gradients towards the outer parts , we find two symmetrical regions where the velocity dispersion values drop significantly compared to their surroundings .",
    "these @xmath0-hollows are located exactly along the major axes of the inner bars and they extend out to the edges , as we checked with several tests .",
    "the amplitude of the hollows varies between 10 and 40 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , neither the h@xmath10 or @xmath11oiii@xmath12 $ ] emission - line maps ( not presented here ) show any distinct features at the same locations of the inner bars .",
    "the stellar velocity dispersion map for ngc5850 was previously shown by , but no hollows are seen in there ; we believe this is because the smaller fov of the mpfs instrument used in those obervations.-2",
    "since the @xmath0-hollows of the four galaxies are observed exactly at the ends of the inner bars , it seems that they are related to the inner bar itself and not to any other structural or kinematical component .",
    "the aim of this section is to investigate the origin of the @xmath0-hollows , so in the following we discuss some possible explanations for these observations .",
    "stellar inner disks could , in principle , explain a decrease in velocity dispersion in the central regions of galaxies , as happens with the @xmath0-drops seen in .",
    "however , the observed alignment of the @xmath0-hollows with the major axis of the inner bar can not be accounted for with the presence of an inner disk whose major axis is usually well aligned with the main photometric major axis of the galaxy .",
    "moreover , the decrease in @xmath0 in our galaxies does not occur at the same locations as the @xmath0-drops seen by ; in fact we find that the velocity dispersion reaches a maximum value at the center .",
    "the possibility of a gaseous inner disk is discarded because the effect we see in our data is purely stellar .",
    "a young stellar component that has acquired the kinematics of the cold gas it was formed from could also explain the decreases in the velocity dispersion values .",
    "this young population might not necessarily be associated with a different structural component ( e.g. a nuclear star forming ring ) .",
    "we tested this hypothesis by performing a preliminary stellar population analysis of the different structures to investigate the presence of young stars ( an extensive stellar population analysis will be published elsewhere ) .",
    "however , we do not find any evidence of the presence of a particularly young stellar population at the @xmath0-hollows locations .",
    "we now focus on the immediate surroundings of the inner bar . in the central parts of these galaxies we have the combination of a component with typically high velocity dispersion ( i.e. a bulge ) and the inner bar with its ordered motion and thus a low @xmath0 .",
    "we propose that the presence of the @xmath0-hollows is due to the contrast between the velocity dispersion of these two components .",
    "since the velocity dispersion profile and the luminosity profile of the bulge decreases outwards , we can only see this effect in the outer parts of the inner bar , where the bulge is not totally dominating the flux .",
    "therefore the amplitude of the hollows will depend on the relative contribution of the bulge to the total luminosity at the extremes of the bar and on the difference of velocity dispersions between the bulge and the inner bar .",
    "irrespective of the relative luminosity of the two components at the edges of the inner bar , if there were no differences between the velocity dispersions we would not be able to find any @xmath0-hollows .",
    "assuming that there is a significant difference in the @xmath0 values at these points , a very extended bulge may have the inner bar embedded in it , so we would expect very deep @xmath0-hollows in this case . on the contrary , if the bulge were less extended these @xmath0-hollows would not show up .    to test this idea we used the code ftm 4.4 ( updated version ) from @xcite to perform n - body self - consistent three - dimensional numerical simulations starting with a ( classical - like ) bulge and an exponential disk .",
    "first , we relax the bulge , in order to have a `` quiescent '' start , and then we introduce an exponential self - graviting rotating disk . the bulge proceeds to evolve almost steadily , contrary to the disk , which develops a bar instability . here",
    ", we use simulations with a single bar to mimic the main components in the region of interest : the central kiloparsec .",
    "this simple approximation is enough to reproduce the @xmath0-hollows : they appear at the ends of the bar for the cases in which the contrast is sufficient .",
    "these @xmath0-hollows last as long as the bar stays with a low @xmath0 .",
    "stellar bars in general could be heated - up by the buckling instability , which is milder in the presence of gas @xcite and in weak bars @xcite .",
    "since the four observed inner bars presented here are not very strong and there is some gas in these regions , most likely they will not buckle .",
    "therefore , we expect the @xmath0-hollows to be long - lived structures .    in figure",
    "[ fig : model ] we illustrate two of our models : one case of a bulge large enough to match the length of the bar , where we are able to reproduce the @xmath0-hollows , and one case with a smaller , less extended bulge where the velocity dispersion profile is almost unchanged .",
    "the simulations shown here use a galaxy inclination of 30@xmath13 ( as a representative case of our observations ) and a position angle of 20@xmath13 for the bar .",
    "however , we repeated the tests with different observational conditions , getting similar results in all cases . note however that recent numerical simulations of double - barred systems by @xcite do not show any evidence of the presence of the @xmath0-hollows in their velocity dispersion maps .",
    "a possible explanation for this absence is the fact that in those simulations there is not sufficient velocity dispersion difference between the resulting structural components .",
    "we have presented 2d kinematical maps of double - barred early - type galaxies covering the whole nuclear region . we have found @xmath0-hollows appearing at the ends of the inner bar for our four objects .",
    "the main result presented in this paper is that these hollows are signatures of inner bars , which indicates that it they must have significantly lower velocity dispersions than the surrounding bulges .",
    "this means that inner bars are cold systems , and are not related to triaxial bulges .",
    "moreover , the observations presented here put constraints on the degree of rotational over pressure support for these structural components .",
    "finally , since the @xmath0-hollows are not due to other structural or kinematical components ( e.g. inner disks ) , they may be used to identify inner bars from a purely stellar kinematic analysis.-2    it is likely that previous numerical simulations were unable to predict the observed @xmath0-hollows because they did not include a sufficiently dynamically hot component ( i.e. classical bulge ) .",
    "however , we have been able to reproduce this feature with simulations including a hot bulge , a single small bar and a disk .",
    "the @xmath0-hollows can be seen due to a contrast between the high velocity dispersion of the bulge and the low velocity dispersion of the bar .",
    "the amplitude of the hollows depends on the relative contributions to the total flux and the relative sizes of the bulge and the inner bar .",
    "while young stellar populations can help to lower the stellar velocity dispersion , no clear signatures of them are found in our sample . based on the pieces of evidence presented in this paper",
    ", we think that the @xmath0-hollows are simply a matter of contrast .",
