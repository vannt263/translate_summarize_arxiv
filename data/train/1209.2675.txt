    "the recently demonstrated @xcite high - fidelity preparation of a single exciton state in a self - assembled quantum dot ( qd ) by means of adiabatic evolution induced by a chirped laser pulse ( referred to as _ adiabatic rapid passage _ , arp ) opens new possibilities of charge control in qds .",
    "in contrast to the more traditional rabi flops @xcite as well as to methods based on voltage control @xcite , arp is much less sensitive to the details of the driving field . in particular , in the ideal case , the arp technique ensures the full inversion of occupation between the empty dot and exciton states as soon as the pulse intensity reaches the threshold for the adiabatic passage .",
    "however , as qds are embedded in a semiconductor crystal matrix , carrier - phonon interactions are usually found to considerably limit the fidelity of various optical control schemes .",
    "the phonon - induced dephasing process is inevitable in such systems and leads to loss of information .",
    "these mechanisms have been investigated theoretically @xcite and have been confirmed experimentally @xcite . as we have recently shown @xcite , in the case of the arp",
    "the role of phonon coupling in the state preparation is essential .",
    "as the adiabatic evolution follows one of the spectral branches corresponding to dressed exciton states , carrier phonon coupling leads to transitions to the other branch . depending on whether the upper or lower branch is followed ( which , in turn , depends on the direction of the chirp )",
    ", the transition is assisted by phonon emission or absorption , respectively . as a consequence , at low temperatures",
    "the phonon - induced decoherence leads to a strong asymmetry in the final occupation of the exciton state depending on the sign of the chirp @xcite . while the analysis performed in ref .",
    "was based on a two - level model , corresponding to the excitation with a circularly polarized laser pulse , in actual experiments linearly polarized beams have been used @xcite . in this case , the selection rules allow the coupling to the biexciton state and phonon - assisted biexciton generation @xcite may occur even at low temperatures , as the biexciton state is typically shifted to lower energies .    in this paper",
    ", we study the evolution of the biexciton system driven by a linearly polarized chirped pulse in the regime of the arp in the presence of the coupling to acoustic phonons .",
    "we show that including the biexciton state , which becomes relevant for linearly polarized laser pulses @xcite , indeed opens a new decoherence path related to phonon - assisted transitions to the biexciton state . as a result ,",
    "the fidelity of exciton state preparation drops down considerably in particular in most of the parameter areas where almost ideal evolution was predicted by the two - level model .",
    "thus , high - fidelity control becomes restricted to the range of moderate pulse areas for positive chirps and at low temperatures only , unless circular polarized pulses are used to suppress biexcitonic excitations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the biexciton system in the qd , restricted to the lowest bright states , is modeled as a four - level system with @xmath0 representing the empty dot , @xmath1,@xmath2 being the two exciton states with different linear polarizations and @xmath3 denoting the biexciton state .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the exciton transition energy , @xmath6 is the biexciton shift , and we neglect the fine structure splitting which is irrelevant on the picosecond time scales considered here .",
    "this charge system is driven by a chirped gaussian pulse with the original envelope @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the original pulse area ( before chirping ) and @xmath9 is the initial duration ( pulse length ) .",
    "the central frequency @xmath10 is chosen at resonance with the single exciton transition .",
    "we assume that the linear chirp is effected by passing this pulse through a gaussian chirp filter @xcite with the chirp coefficient @xmath11 .",
    "this results in the chirped pulse envelope @xmath12 with the chirped pulse length @xmath13 , and the frequency chirp rate @xmath14 .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the coupling to the chirped pulse in the rotating wave approximation is @xmath15 thus , for one linear polarization , the coupling is @xmath16 and the other single - exciton state @xmath17 is decoupled ( it is not coupled by phonon transitions , either@xcite ) .",

    "the gray solid line represents the pulse envelope @xmath23 which has been shifted upwards for clarity.,width=336 ]    the idea of the adiabatic passage @xcite is to drive the system state adiabatically along one of the spectral branches corresponding to the instantaneous eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath24 .",

    "fig : branches](b ) a negative chirp is assumed . for pulse intensities above the arp threshold , the central anticrossing at @xmath27 ( between the vacuum and exciton states ) is passed adiabatically along a single spectral branch . on the contrary , the two other anticrossings away from @xmath27 ( exciton - biexciton and vacuum biexciton ) are met when the pulse is already very weak , hence they are very narrow ( in the case shown here , the widths of both of these anticrossings are below 10  @xmath28ev , unresolved in fig .  [",

    "the sweep rate is very high compared to the distance between the two levels , which leads to a nearly purely non - adiabatic evolution : these anticrossings are almost completely crossed by the evolving system state , that is , the system nearly completely jumps to the other branch ( as shown by color coding of the lines in fig .",

    "we assume that the biexcitonic and excitonic wave functions can be factorized into products of single particle wave functions which are the same for both exciton and biexciton .",

    "the results show a reduction of the final occupation of the single exciton state at higher pulse areas for a very small biexciton shift ( @xmath60  mev ) and positive chirps . we have found that under these conditions , a biexciton occupation on the order of @xmath78 occurs ( not shown ) . on the other hand , for the still small value of @xmath25  mev ,",
    "the evolution is nearly unperturbed by the presence of the biexciton state .",
    "thus we conclude that for @xmath79  mev no direct population of the biexciton occurs with the pulses studied here , as the driving of the exciton to biexciton transition is too off - resonant .    in the next step ,",

    "let us start the discussion for the case of the large biexciton shift @xmath61  mev and low temperature @xmath66  k shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : maps](b ) . as expected ,",
    "the results from the two - level model @xcite are retrieved and a strong asymmetry in the final occupation with respect to the chirp is seen . in the two - level model , for negative chirp",
    "the evolution follows the upper branch and phonon emission leads to damping , while for positive chirps the lower branch is followed and since phonon absorption is almost absent at 1  k a full exciton occupation is reached .",
    "in contrast , in fig .  [",
    "fig : maps](a ) , for the small biexciton shift @xmath25  mev , the influence of the biexciton state can be clearly seen . in particular , for positive chirps a decoherence at high pulse areas is visible due to the opening of the new decoherence channel consisting in transitions to the biexciton state ( phonon - assisted biexciton generation ) . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : branches ] , for a negative biexciton shift ( positive biexciton binding energy ) , this process corresponds to phonon emission no matter which adiabatic branch is followed , hence it is effective irrespective of the sign of the chirp even at low temperatures . also for negative chirps",
    "the damping has become more effective .",
    "thus , only for moderate pulse areas around @xmath18 a high - fidelity preparation of the single exciton state is possible .    when considering higher temperatures , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : maps](c - f ) , phonon absorption becomes more likely and now also for positive chirps decoherence due to transitions between the main branches is stronger .",

    "one can see that at a certain level of phonon - assisted biexciton generation the result exceeds 1 , which has no sense if interpreted in terms of the two - level model .",
    "moreover , it is clear that even below this limit , the biexciton contribution leads to an overestimated occupation of the single exciton state .",
    "in summary , we have studied the open system evolution of a qd adiabatically controlled by a chirped linearly polarized laser pulse .",
    "we have shown that the presence of a biexciton state , which becomes optically coupled for linearly polarized laser pulses @xcite , opens new decoherence paths related to phonon - assisted biexciton generation .",
    "if the biexciton state is shifted down by @xmath90 or @xmath91  mev it becomes accessible via phonon emission processes and the resulting decoherence is strong even at low temperatures .",
    "this reduces the achieved occupation of the single exciton state in the parameters range where the chirped pulse control was very efficient in a model without the biexciton state .",
    "since the phonon - assisted biexciton generation increases with the pulse area moderate pulse areas are optimal for the state preparation . on the other hand ,",
    "if the biexciton shift is larger , the two - level evolution is essentially recovered .",
