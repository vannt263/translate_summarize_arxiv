    "domain walls are surfaces interpolating between regions of space  time with different expectation values of some matter field(s ) .",

    "domain wall configurations are possible if the effective potential of the corresponding matter field(s)has more than one isolated minimum . if each side of the domain wall corresponds to a vacuum , that is , if on either side all the matter fields have _ constant _ expectation values , then all the local properties of each side are lorentz - invariant and each side is a _ vacuum_. such domain walls are usually referred to as _ vacuum domain walls_.    vacuum domain walls can be classified according to the value of their surface energy density @xmath8 , compared to the energy densities of the vacua outside the wall @xcite .",
    "the three types are : ( 1 )  extreme walls with @xmath9 are planar , static walls . in this case",
    "there is a perfect balance between the gravitational mass of the wall and that of the exterior vacua ; ( 2 )  non - extreme walls with @xmath10 corresponding to non - static bubbles with two centres and ( 3 )  ultra - extreme walls with @xmath11 representing expanding bubbles of false vacuum decay .",
    "the extreme domain wall solutions were found @xcite in @xmath12 supergravity theory , representing walls interpolating between isolated supersymmetric vacua of the matter potential .",
    "they correspond to supersymmetric configurations saturating the corresponding bogomolnyi bound .",
    "there are three possible types @xcite of these extreme vacuum domain walls .",

    "type  ii and type  iii walls interpolate between two supersymmetric anti - de  sitter vacua . for a type  ii wall the superpotential",

    "time structure as the one of the corresponding extreme [ _ or _ non - extreme ]  charged black holes ; however , now the time - like singularity of the charged black holes is replaced by another wall .    on the other hand , the existence of dilatons is a generic feature of unifying theories , including effective actions of superstring vacua , certain classes of supergravity theories as well as kaluza - klein theories . `",
    "dilaton ' is here used as a generic name for a scalar field without self - interactions that couple to the matter sources , _",
    "i.e_.  the potential of scalar matter fields as well as the kinetic energy of gauge fields , and thereby it modulates the overall strength of such interactions . in the low - energy effective action of superstring theory ,",
    "the dilaton plays an essential rle for the `` scale - factor duality '' @xcite , which has been taken as an indication of a `` dual pre - big - bang '' phase as a possible alternative to the initial singularity of the standard cosmological model @xcite .",
    "the dilaton is believed to play a crucial role in dynamical supersymmetry breaking as well .    moreover , in theories with dilaton field(s ) , topological defects in general , and black holes in particular , have a space  time structure that is drastically changed compared to the non - dilatonic ones .",
    "namely , since the dilaton couples to the matter sources , _",
    "e.g_.  the charge of the black hole , or it modulates the strength of the matter interactions , it in turn changes the nature of the space  time . in the past , charged dilatonic black holes have been studied extensively ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is therefore of considerable interest to generalize another type of topological defects , _",
    "i.e_.the vacuum domain wall solutions @xcite , by including the dilaton , thus addressing the nature of space  time in the domain wall background with a varying dilaton field .",
    "such configurations may be of specific interest in the study of domain walls in the early universe as they may arise in fundamental theories that include the dilaton , in particular in an effective theory from superstrings .",
    "in addition , the nature of ultra - extreme dilatonic domain walls , which describe false vacuum decay , is of importance in basic theories that contain one or more dilaton fields .",
    "the first set of extreme dilatonic domain wall solutions  @xcite was found in @xmath12 supergravity theory coupled to a linear supermultiplet . there",
    "the dilaton @xmath0 corresponds to the scalar component of the linear multiplet ; @xmath0 couples with an exponential coupling @xmath2 to the potential of the matter scalar fields , and with a `` complementary '' exponential coupling @xmath16 to the kinetic energy of the gauge fields .",
    "the coupling @xmath17 is the one of the effective tree level action of the superstring .",
    "the extreme domain wall configurations for such actions correspond to static domain walls interpolating between supersymmetric minima of the matter potential .",
    "however , along with the dependence of the space ",
    "time metric on the coordinate distance from the wall , @xmath14 , also the dilaton field now varies with @xmath14 .",

    "time structure on the latter side crucially depends on the value of the coupling constant @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath5 there is a planar null singularity , while for @xmath4 the singularity is _",
    "naked_. at the singularity both the dilaton field and the space  time curvature diverge .    in the @xmath15 slice , the global space ",
    "time structure of the type  i extreme dilatonic walls with coupling @xmath1 turns out to be the same @xcite as the @xmath20 slice of the extreme charged dilatonic black holes with coupling @xmath21 .",
    "the complementarity between the global space  time structure of the extreme dilatonic domain walls with coupling @xmath1 and",
    "extreme charged dilatonic black holes with coupling @xmath21 can be traced back to the nature of the coupling @xmath2 of the dilaton to the matter potential ( the source for the wall)and the complementary coupling @xmath16 of the dilaton to the gauge kinetic energy ( the source of the charge of the black hole ) .",
    "the newly found complementarity ( @xmath22 )  between the extreme wall and extreme charged black hole solutions is a generalization of the one found @xcite between extreme vacuum domain walls ( @xmath23 )  and ordinary extreme black holes ( @xmath24 ) .",

    "we generalize the extreme dilatonic solutions to the case with an arbitrary separable dilaton k \" ahler potential .",
    "we derive the corresponding bogomolnyi equations for the static , supersymmetric walls , and in the thin wall approximation also the energy density of such walls , which saturates the corresponding bogomolnyi bound .",

    "i.e_.  when the k \" ahler potential has an extremum for a finite dilaton value .",
    "the major part of this paper involves a study of the space ",
    "time for non - extreme and ultra - extreme dilatonic domain walls in the thin wall approximation .",
    "the solutions are non - static bubbles .",
    "these solutions can be parametrized by a parameter @xmath25 that measures deviation from extremality ; that is to say , @xmath26 represents the corresponding extreme solution . within @xmath12 supergravity",
    "such walls would correspond to solutions which interpolate between two isolated minima of the matter potential , where at least one of the isolated minima breaks supersymmetry .",
    "these walls are generalizations of the corresponding non- and ultra - extreme vacuum domain walls , but now , only numerical solutions have been obtained .",
    "for this reason , the analysis can be done only for walls for which the boundary conditions for the dilaton field and the metric can be specified uniquely at the wall surface .",
    "nonetheless , such cases include the physically interesting example of type  i walls , which interpolate between minkowski space  time with a constant dilaton value and a new type of space  time with varying dilaton , as well as reflection - symmetric ( non - extreme )  walls .",
    "interestingly , the space  time induced in the dilatonic domain wall backgrounds can be related to certain cosmological solutions by a complex coordinate transformation where @xmath14 is replaced with a cosmic time coordinate and where the potential changes sign .",
    "the non - extremality parameter @xmath25 then plays the rle of a cosmological spatial curvature : @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the nature of the dilatonic domain wall space  time solutions can be related to the corresponding cosmological solutions , and where it is possible , we draw the analogy .",
    "we concentrate on the case with a general exponential dilaton coupling ( @xmath2)to the matter potential that creates the wall .",
    "it turns out that  unlike the extreme case  for any @xmath1 and any non - zero value of the non - extremality parameter @xmath25 , there is a _ naked _ singularity on ( at least)one side of the wall .",
    "we further generalize the solutions with an arbitrary dilaton coupling function @xmath28 for the dilaton coupling to the matter potential .",
    "for the functions which have an extremum @xmath29 , _",
    "i.e_.  self - dual functions , one finds solutions with singularity - free vacuum domain wall space  times . however , it turns out that only non- and ultra - extreme walls of this type are dynamically stable",
    ". we also comment on the effects of a dilaton mass , which in basic theory can be induced as a non - perturbative effect .",
    "such a mass ( or any other attractive self - interaction)does not alter the space ",
    "time sufficiently to remove the naked singularity .    the nature of the space ",
    "time for non- and ultra - extreme dilatonic domain walls , which possesses naked singularities , poses serious constraints on the phenomenological viability of theories with dilaton fields , including a large class of @xmath12 supergravity theories as well as the effective low energy theory from superstrings .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : thinwall ] we spell out the formalism for the study of space  time of dilatonic domain walls in the thin wall approximation .",

    "then , in section  [ sect : non / ultra ] we analyse the non- and ultra - extreme solutions .",
    "our results are summarized and discussed in the concluding section  [ sect : conclusion ] .",
    "a generic feature of the dilaton is that it couples coherently to matter sources , like kinetic energy of the gauge fields and the potential associated with the scalar matter fields . in the case of a domain wall , due to the dilaton coupling to the potential of the wall - forming scalar field , the dilaton will in general vary with the distance from the wall .",
    "this in turn implies that the gravitational field outside the wall is determined not only by the direct gravitational effect of the wall , but also indirectly through the effects of the varying dilaton , which in turn change the nature of space ",
    "time on either side of the wall .",
    "our main goal is to understand the global structure of the induced space ",
    "times for such dilatonic domain wall configurations .",
    "the ones of most interest are the walls where on one side the dilaton is constant and space  time is minkowskian .",
    "the other side would involve a new space ",

    "this term is not there in the original theory .",
    "it is , however , believed to be generated after dynamical ( super)symmetry breaking , and it is responsible for giving the dilaton a mass .    in general , the potential ( [ potential])need not have a supersymmetric embedding . in this case",

    "i.e_.the frame in which all the modes of the string theory couple coherently to the dilaton field . since the metric is flat in the string frame , strings , which include all the modes , are `` blind '' to the curvature and to the singularities in the extreme domain wall backgrounds .",
    "one could then argue that the singularities are artefacts coming from the use of the einstein frame , and that the fundamental physics as described using the metric @xmath328 , _ i.e_.the string frame metric and its generalizations , is well behaved .    in the extreme case",
    "there is always a frame with @xmath328 , and in which ( naked )  singularities are swept under the rug .",
    "this , however , is not possible in the non- and ultra - extreme cases . in the non - extreme case",
    "the conformal factor in the @xmath329-frame grows as one goes away from the wall , and in the ultra - extreme case it decreases , see fig .",
    "[ string_frame ] .",
    "this implies that singularities are now felt in the @xmath329-frame as well .",
    "furthermore , this result seems to imply a paradox . according to measurements in the einstein frame , the area of an embedding surface at constant co - moving time decreases as one goes away from the wall on the side with the lowest value of the matter field potential .",
    "this is true in both the non- and ultra - extreme cases .",
    "this side is therefore _ inside _ the bubble .",
    "but now , according to the same type of measurements in the @xmath329-frame , the side with the lowest value of the matter field potential is on the _ outside _ of the bubble in the ultra - extreme case .",
    "how can the same side be both on the inside and on the outside of the wall ?",
    "the paradox is resolved when one realizes that this local definition of inside and outside depends on the conformal frame and that , because of the singularity cutting through space  time , there is no topological obstruction to turn it `` inside out . ''",
    "now we consider a reflection - symmetric non - extreme wall ( a special case of type  ii walls)with non - vanishing @xmath46 and a running dilaton . the potential is taken to be that of eq .",

    "one might hope that a dilaton self - interaction term , providing a mass for the dilaton , could stabilize the system and keep the dilaton from running away . for the sake of simplicity we consider an additional self - interaction potential @xmath335 of the form @xmath336 where @xmath337 and @xmath338 are real constants .",

    "the physics of this problem is most easily understood in the cosmological picture .",

    "[ non_phi_self ] .",
    "now , in the ultra - extreme case , the dilaton reaches a maximum in its exponential potential and then returns .",
    "a self - interaction potential would tend to accelerate the dilaton in the positive direction .",
    "if this force is strong enough , the result will be as in the non - extreme case .",
    "if the exponential potential dominates , the dilaton will again return . in either case",
    ", the dilaton runs off and produces a naked singularity .",
    "in the ultra - extreme case , this can only be avoided by a fine - tuned self - interaction potential whose fine - tuning would have to depend also on @xmath25 .",
    "examples of these two scenarios are shown in fig .",

    "clearly , as @xmath285 , @xmath41 approaches a constant value , and therefore the solution is again stable .",
    "along similar lines one can prove that constant dilaton ultra - extreme solutions are also stable against an infinitesimal perturbation . in particular , in the case of minkowski constant dilaton vacuum on the @xmath194 side of the wall , @xmath375 and eq .",

    "thus , the ultra - extreme solution is stable as well .    in conclusion , in a theory with a self - dual dilaton coupling",
    "extreme solutions with a constant dilaton are always unstable against small perturbation .",
    "the origin of the instability of extreme solutions may be related to an infinite extent of such planar configurations . on the other hand , non- as well as ultra - extreme solutions with a constant dilaton are always dynamically stable .",
    "we have analysed the gravitational fields induced by dilatonic domain walls with an exponential dilaton coupling and with a self - dual dilaton coupling .",
    "we have shown that generic non- and ultra - extreme dilatonic domain walls with an exponential dilaton coupling ( @xmath2 )  have naked singularities .",
    "in contrast , extreme walls have planar naked singularities for @xmath4 , while for @xmath5 the singularities are null . in the frame",
    "where the extreme domain wall metric is flat ( and which for @xmath17 corresponds to the string frame ) , the non - extreme domain walls still have naked singularities , whereas the ultra - extreme singularities are hidden behind horizons in this frame .",
    "the ultra - extreme domain walls correspond to false vacuum decay bubbles and as such they might have a direct physical relevance if the minkowski vacuum turns out to be unstable .",
    "a vacuum decay would , according to the theory we have used , force the dilaton to start running even if it had previously been trapped by a mass term or another self - interaction potential .",
    "the kinetic energy of the dilaton would then grow without bound and lead to a naked singularity .    for exponential dilaton coupling",
    "the non- and ultra - extreme domain walls have naked singularities , which can not be avoided by adding a mass term for the dilaton .",
    "on the other hand , when the dilaton coupling is self - dual , there are singularity - free domain wall configurations : outside the domain wall region , the dilaton is then trapped at the self - dual point and the domain wall geometries reduce to those of the singularity - free vacuum domain walls .",
    "this class of solutions is dynamically stable for non- and ultra - extreme walls , but the extreme solutions of such a type are not dynamically stable .",
    "we have therefore arrived at the conclusion that for a large class of theories with dilaton(s ) , the space  times of non- and ultra - extreme domain walls ( as well as some extreme domain walls)are necessarily plagued with naked singularities .",
    "if one believes that the gravitational field of vacuum decay bubbles and non - extreme domain walls should be singularity - free , this observation imposes serious constraints on the phenomenological viability of such theories .",
    "in particular , the exponential dilaton coupling of the effective tree level action from superstrings is ruled out .",
