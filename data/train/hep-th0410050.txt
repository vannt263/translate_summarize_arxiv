    "the total norm ( equaled to 1 ) is given by sum over all the sectors : @xmath9 , where @xmath10-body contribution @xmath11 reads : @xmath12    in applications , the infinite set of the fock components is usually truncated to a few components only .",
    "the belief that a given fock sector dominates ( with two or three quarks , for instance ) is often based on intuitive expectations and on `` experimental evidences '' rather than on field - theoretical analysis .    in the wick - cutkosky model",

    "subtracting them from 1 , we get total contribution of all the sectors with @xmath14 . besides , we also calculate their contributions to the electromagnetic form factor .",

    "the interaction is reduced to the coulomb potential @xmath27 .",
    "the normalization condition for @xmath21 is found from the requirement that the full electromagnetic form factor @xmath28 ( calculated with full state vector @xmath3 and , hence , incorporating all the fock components ) equals to 1 at @xmath29 .",

    ", we find : @xmath44    substituting ( [ bs10 ] ) into ( [ norm ] ) , we obtain the two - body contribution to the full normalization : @xmath45    three - body contribution @xmath46 is found in @xcite by calculating the amplitudes fig .",

    "the sum @xmath54 contributes 90% even in the extremely strong coupling case , as we see in ( [ n2 ] ) .",
