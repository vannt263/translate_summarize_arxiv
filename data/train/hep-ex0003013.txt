    "since the phase space factor @xmath66 tends to zero as @xmath67 , the decay rate vanishes at @xmath63 and the accuracy of the extrapolation relies on achieving a reasonably constant reconstruction efficiency in the region near @xmath63 .",
    "previous measurements of  have been made using b mesons produced on the @xmath68 resonance @xcite and in  decays @xcite .",
    "these analyses used a linear or constrained quadratic expansion of  around @xmath63 .",

    "were then combined into jets using a cone algorithm  @xcite , with a cone half angle of 0.65rad and a minimum jet energy of 5gev .",
    "the transverse momentum @xmath75 of each track was defined relative to the axis of the jet containing it , where the jet axis was calculated including the momentum of the track .",
    "a total of 3117544  events passed the event selection .",
    "the reconstruction of  events was then performed by combining high @xmath76 and @xmath75 lepton ( electron or muon ) candidates with oppositely charged pions from the @xmath0 decay .",
    "electrons were identified and photon conversions rejected using neural network algorithms @xcite , and muons were identified as in @xcite .",
    "both electrons and muons were required to have momenta @xmath77 , transverse momenta with respect to the jet axis @xmath78 , and to lie in the polar angle region @xmath79 .",
    "the event sample was further enhanced in semileptonic b decays by requiring a separated secondary vertex with decay length significance @xmath80 in any jet of the event .",
    "the vertex reconstruction algorithm and decay length significance calculation are described fully in @xcite .",
    "together with the lepton selection , these requirements result in a sample which is about 90% pure in  events .",
    "an attempt was made to estimate the  direction in each jet containing a lepton candidate . each track (",
    "apart from the lepton ) and calorimeter cluster in the jet was assigned a weight corresponding to the estimated probability that it came from the  decay .",
    "the track weight was calculated from an artificial neural network , trained to separate tracks from b decays and fragmentation tracks in b  jets @xcite .",
    "the network inputs are the track momentum , transverse momentum with respect to the jet axis , and impact parameter significances with respect to the reconstructed primary and secondary vertices ( if existing ) .",

    "were then grouped together until the invariant mass of the group ( assigning tracks the pion mass and clusters zero mass ) exceeded the charm hadron mass , taken to be 1.8gev .",
    "if the final invariant mass exceeded 2.3gev , the jet was rejected , since monte carlo studies showed such high mass  candidates were primarily background . for surviving jets ,",
    "the momentum  of the group was used as an estimate of the  direction , giving rms angular resolutions of about 45mrad in @xmath73 and @xmath72 .",
    "the energy was calculated as @xmath81 .",
    "the selection of pions from  decays relies on the small mass difference of only 145mev @xcite between the  and , which means the pions have very little transverse momentum with respect to the  direction .",
    "each track in the jet ( other than the lepton ) was considered as a slow pion candidate , provided it satisfied @xmath82gev and had a transverse momentum with respect to the  direction of less than 0.3gev .",
    "if the pion under consideration was included in the reconstructed , it was removed and the  momentum and energy recalculated .",
    "the final selection was made using the reconstructed mass difference between  and  mesons , calculated as @xmath83 where the  energy is given by @xmath84 and momentum by @xmath85 .",
    "a new secondary vertex was then iteratively reconstructed around an initial seed vertex formed by the intersection of the lepton and slow pion tracks .",
    "every other track in the jet was added in turn to the seed vertex , and the vertex refitted .",
    "the track resulting in the lowest vertex fit @xmath86 was retained in the seed vertex for the next iteration .",
    "the procedure was repeated until no more tracks could be added without reducing the vertex fit @xmath86 probability to less than 1% .",
    "the decay length @xmath87 between the primary vertex and this secondary vertex , and the associated error @xmath88 , were calculated as in @xcite .",

    "the predictions of the monte carlo simulation are also shown , broken down into contributions from signal  events , ` resonant ' background containing real leptons and slow pions from  decay , and combinatorial background , made up of events with fake slow pions , fake leptons or both .    in monte",
    "carlo simulation , about 45% of opposite sign events with @xmath91 are signal  events , 14% are resonant background and 41% are combinatorial background . the resonant background is made up mainly of @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 decays .",
    "these are expected to be dominated by b semileptonic decays involving orbitally excited charm mesons ( generically referred to as ) , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath95 followed by @xmath96 .",
    "these decays will be denoted collectively by @xmath97 .",
    "small contributions are also expected from @xmath98 decays with the @xmath99 decaying leptonically , and @xmath100 with the @xmath101 decaying semileptonically ( each about 1% of opposite sign events ) . for same sign events with @xmath102gev , there is a small resonant contribution of about 6% from events with a real @xmath0 where the  decays semileptonically , and the rest is combinatorial background .",
    "the most important background , from @xmath97  decays , comes from both charged  and neutral  and  decays , whereas the signal comes only from  decays .",
    "therefore the charge  of the reconstructed secondary vertex containing the lepton and slow pion and its estimated error  were calculated , using @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the weight for track @xmath105 of charge @xmath106 to come from the secondary vertex , and the sums are taken over all tracks in the jet @xcite .",
    "the weights were calculated in a similar way to those used for the  direction reconstruction , using a neural network with the track momentum , transverse momentum and impact parameter significances with respect to the reconstructed primary and secondary vertices as inputs .",
    "the weights for the lepton and slow pion candidate tracks were set to one .",
    "the vertex charge distributions for opposite sign events with @xmath102gev are shown in figure  [ f : dmdmc](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the reconstructed vertex charge and error were used to divide the data into different classes enhanced or depleted in  decays , thus reducing the effect of this background and increasing the statistical sensitivity .",
    "three classes @xmath107 were used ",
    "class  1 where the charge is measured poorly ( @xmath108 ) , class  2 where the charge is measured well and is compatible with a neutral vertex ( @xmath109 , @xmath110 ) and class  3 where the charge is measured well and is compatible with a charged vertex ( @xmath109 , @xmath111 ) .",

    "the  and  energies  and  were estimated directly , whilst the momentum vectors  and were estimated using the energies together with the reconstructed polar and azimuthal angles , as described in more detail below .    since the slow pion has very little momentum in the rest frame of the decaying , the momentum ( and hence energy ) of the  was estimated by scaling the reconstructed slow pion momentum by @xmath114 , as for the @xmath2 channel in @xcite . a small correction ( never exceeding 12% )",
    "was applied , as a function of @xmath115 , the angle of the slow pion in the rest frame of the .",

    "the polar and azimuthal angles of the  were reconstructed using weighted averages of the slow pion and  directions , giving resolutions of about 22mrad on both @xmath73 and @xmath72 .",
    "the energy of the  was estimated using a technique similar to that described in @xcite , exploiting the overall energy and momentum conservation in the event to calculate the energy of the unreconstructed neutrino .",
    "first , the energy @xmath116 of the jet containing the   was inferred from the measured particles in the rest of the event , by treating the event as a two - body decay of a  into a b jet ( whose mass was approximated by the  mass ) and another object making up the rest of the event . then , the total fragmentation energy @xmath117 in the b jet was estimated from the measured visible energy in the b jet and the identified  decay products : @xmath118 . finally , the  energy was calculated as @xmath119 , giving an rms resolution of 4.4gev .",
    "the b direction was estimated using a combination of two techniques . in the first",
    ", the momentum vector of the  was reconstructed from its decay products : @xmath120 the neutrino energy being estimated from the reverse of the event visible momentum vector : @xmath121 .",
    "the visible momentum was calculated using all the reconstructed tracks and clusters in the event , with a correction for charged particles measured both in the tracking detectors and calorimeters @xcite .",
    "this direction estimate is strongly degraded if a second neutrino is present ( _ e.g. _ from another semileptonic b decay in the opposite hemisphere of the event ) , and its error was parameterised as a function of the visible energy in the opposite hemisphere .",
    "the resulting resolution is typically between 40 and 100mrad for both @xmath73 and @xmath72 .    the second method of estimating the  direction used the vertex flight direction_i.e . _ the direction of the vector between the primary vertex and the secondary vertex reconstructed around the lepton and slow pion as described in section  [ s : rec ] .",
    "the accuracy of this estimate is strongly dependent on the  decay length , and was used only if the decay length significance @xmath122 exceeded 3 .",
    "after this cut , the angular resolution varies between about 15 and 100mrad , and is worse for @xmath72 in the 1991 and 1992 data where accurate @xmath123 information from the silicon microvertex detector was not available .",
    "the  candidate was rejected if the two reconstruction methods gave @xmath72 or @xmath73 angles disagreeing by more than three standard deviations , which happened in 7% of monte carlo signal events .",
    "finally , the two  direction estimates were combined according to their estimated uncertainties , giving average resolutions of 35mrad on @xmath73 and 43mrad on @xmath72 , including events where only the first method was used .",
    "the estimate of @xmath59 derived from the  and  energies and angles was improved by applying the constraint that the mass @xmath124 of the neutrino produced in the  decay should be zero . the neutrino mass is given from the reconstructed quantities by : @xmath125 the constraint was implemented by calculating @xmath59 using a kinematic fit , incorporating the measured values and estimated uncertainties of the  and  energies and angles ( the  angular uncertainties varying event by event ) .",
    "this procedure improved the average @xmath59 resolution from 2.78gev@xmath126 to 2.57gev@xmath126 . in monte carlo simulation , 11% of signal events were reconstructed with @xmath127 , corresponding to an unphysical value of @xmath57 larger than @xmath128 , and were rejected .",
