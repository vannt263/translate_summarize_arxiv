    "the reservoir around the bh is no more fed by additional gas , so that even the accretion and the nuclear activity come to an end .",
    "more in general , we can implement lightcurves for the luminosity associated to the star formation and to the bh accretion in a continuity equation approach . in the context of quasar statistics ,",

    "the extension and the derivation of the bh mass function has been pioneered by small & blandford ( 1992 ) , who first attempted to connect the present day bh mass function to the agns luminosity evolution .",

    "in the last decade the continuity equation has been widely used , though the lightcurve of the agn , one of the fundamental ingredients , was largely based on assumptions ( e.g. , marconi et al .",

    "results on the bh mass function through the continuity equation have been reviewed by kelly & merloni ( 2012 ) and shankar ( 2013 ) .",
    "we will also implement the continuity equation for the stellar content of galaxies .",
    "this has become possible because the uv surveys for lyman break galaxies , the wide surveys _",
    "hermes _ and _ h - atlas _ obtained with the _ herschel _ space observatory made possible to reconstruct the star formation rate function in the universe out to @xmath19 for sfrs @xmath38 yr@xmath11 .",
    "therefore , we can exploit the continuity equation , in an analogous manner as routinely done for the agns ; the bh mass is replaced by the mass in stars and the bolometric luminosity due to accretion is replaced by the luminosity generated by the formation of young , massive stars .",
    "as for the stellar mass function , it is inferred by exploiting the observed luminosity function in the wavelength range of the sed dominated by the emission from older , less massive stars . the passage from stellar luminosity to mass is plagued by several problems , which result in uncertainties of order of a factor of @xmath39 , increasing for young , dusty galaxies ( e.g. , cappellari et al .",

    "* we have provided a continuous rendition of the overall sfr function , interpolating between the uv data at the faint and the fir data at the bright end .",

    "* we have developed a procedure to derive the galaxy halo mass function at different redshifts .",

    "in this appendix we detail our procedure to derive the galactic halo mass function , i.e. , the mass function associated to halos hosting one individual galaxy .",
    "the computation actually includes two steps : ( i ) we account for the possibility that a halo contains various subhalos ; ( ii ) we probabilistically exclude halos corresponding to galaxy systems rather than to individual galaxies .",
    "our starting point is the subhalo mass function , as recently determined by jiang & van den bosch ( 2014 ) .",
    "the distribution of subhalos with mass between @xmath457 and @xmath458 in a halo of mass @xmath373 at redshift @xmath135 can be well fitted by the function @xmath459 where @xmath460 . actually if @xmath457 is taken as the subhalo mass at the infall time , the resulting _ unevolved _ subhalo mass function is universal for any mass @xmath373 and as such described by the parameter set @xmath461=[0.22,-0.91,6.00,3.00]$ ] .",
    "this is plotted in fig .",
    "a1 .    however , we are more interested in taking @xmath457 as the mass of the surviving , self - bound entity at redshift @xmath135 , which is reduced with respect to that at accretion due to mass stripping and dynamical friction .",
    "the resulting _ evolved _ subhalo mass function is then described by the same functional shape in eq .",
    "( a1 ) but with modified parameter set @xmath461=[0.31\\ , f_s,-0.82,50.00,4.00]$ ] which depends on the host halo mass and redshift through the quantity @xmath462 .",
    "the latter may be determined as follows : first one obtains the half - mass redshift @xmath463 solving @xmath464 , @xmath465 being the linear threshold for collapse at redshift @xmath135 , and @xmath466 the mass variance at the scale @xmath52 .",
    "then one computes @xmath467 , @xmath468 being the halo dynamical time .",
    "finally , @xmath469 holds .",
    "the outcome is illustrated for different redshift and host halo masses in fig .",
    "now we can compute the overall subhalo contribution to the halo mass function in the mass bin between @xmath373 and @xmath470 as @xmath471 where @xmath472 is the standard halo mass function ( see sheth & tormen 1999 ; tinker et al .",
    "thus the total halo @xmath437 subhalo mass function just reads @xmath473 in fig .",
    "a2 we plot at different redshift the halo mass function , the overall subhalo mass function , and the total halo plus subhalo mass function .",
    "it is easily seen that the subhalo contribution is almost negligible for any redshift in the mass range of interest for this work .",
    "now we turn to compute the probability distribution for a given halo to contain one individual galaxy .",
    "the first step is to obtain the halo occupation number ( hon ) , i.e. , the average number of subhalos inside a host halo of mass @xmath373 ; it writes @xmath474 here @xmath475 represents a minimum mass for subhalos , required to avoid the divergence in the above integral .",
    "this will be set by comparison with numerical simulations and observational datasets .",
    "the resulting hon as a function of @xmath373 and redshift , for different minimum subhalo masses @xmath475 is illustrated in fig .",
    "a3 . for high @xmath476 the hon",
    "is well fitted by a power - law with logarithmic slope @xmath319 , going into an abrupt cutoff for masses @xmath477 .",
    "the hon represents the _ average _ number of subhalos inside a host halo , but we need instead the probability distribution @xmath478 of having @xmath479 subhalos given the average number @xmath480 .",
    "numerical simulations and hod models aimed at reproducing various galaxy observables ( zehavi et al .",
    "2005 , 2011 ; zheng et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ; tinker et al .",
    "2013 ) indicate that such a distribution is well approximated by a poissonian",
    ". then one can easily compute the cumulative probability @xmath481 of having less than @xmath479 subhalos .",
    "this reads @xmath482 where @xmath483 is the incomplete complementary @xmath484-function , @xmath485 is the floor function ( the closest integer lower than @xmath486 ) , and @xmath487 the factorial function .",
    "we stress that in such a probability the dependence on host halo mass and redshift are encased into the hon @xmath488 .",
    "finally , the galaxy halo mass function can be computed as @xmath489 the outcomes at different redshifts , having adopted a minimum satellite mass of @xmath490 , are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig|ghmf ] of the main text . with respect to the full halo @xmath437 subhalo mass function ,",
    "the ghmf features a cutoff for host halo masses @xmath491 , more pronounced at lower redshift .",
    "this is because the probability of hosting subhalos ( hence more than one galaxy ) increases strongly for large masses . in other words ,",
    "such halos are more likely to host a galaxy group or cluster than an individual galaxy .",
    "we stress that both a minimum mass of @xmath492 a few @xmath359 for satellite halos",
    "( corresponding to the adopted @xmath475 ) , and a maximal value @xmath492 a few @xmath493 for a halo to host an individual galaxy ( corresponding to the resulting cutoff in the ghmf ) are strongly indicated by galaxy weak lensing observations ( mandelbaum et al .",

    "; see also the review by corteau et al .",
    "2014 ) .    finally , to provide a further observational test ,",
    "we have computed the group and cluster mass function by subtracting the ghmf from the overall halo @xmath437 subhalo mass function .",
    "this represents the halo mass function associated only to galaxy systems , and as such is expected to show a cutoff for halo masses @xmath494 .",
    "the result at @xmath186 is plotted as a dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig|ghmf ] of the main text , and compared with the determinations by boehringer et al . (",

    "( 2002 ) from optical observations of loose groups ; the agreement is quite impressive .",
    "we notice that the behavior in the range of poor clusters and groups is particularly sensitive to the parameter @xmath495 .",
    "thus the agreement with the data is another indication that the adopted value around @xmath359 is appropriate .",
    "the overall halo and the galaxy halo mass functions can be fitted with the functional shape of eq .",

    "the resulting fits are accurate within @xmath168 in the redshift range from @xmath59 to @xmath192 and halo mass range from @xmath192 to @xmath496 for the ghmf and from @xmath192 to @xmath497 for the hmf .",
    "many recent works ( e.g. , shankar et al . 2009 , 2013 ; moster et al .",
    "2010 , 2013 ) have shown that the role of dry mergers ( i.e. , addition of the whole mass content in stars or bhs of the merging halos without contributing significantly to star formation or bh accretion ) in building up the bh / stellar mass functions is less important than accretion / in - situ star formation at @xmath208 .",
    "this is simply because the evolutionary times associated to mergers are much longer than those associated to the in - situ bh / stellar mass growth . on the other hand , at @xmath147",
    "the situation is expected to reverse .",
    "this is because the cold accreting or starforming gas within the dm halo gets progressively exhausted or is ejected / heated by the energy feedback from supernovae or from the agn itself .",
    "in fact , the continuity equation with accretion only yields little evolution of the mass functions from @xmath498 to @xmath234 ( cf . figs .",
    "[ fig|bh_mf ] and [ fig|star_mf ] and related insets ) .",
    "thus the low redshift @xmath147 evolution could be in principle more affected by dry merging .",
    "this is a hotly debated issue in the literature , especially in relation to the size evolution of massive , passively - evolving galaxies ( e.g. , naab et al .",

    "in this appendix we highlight the impact of dry mergers on the supermassive bh / stellar mass functions at @xmath147 .",
    "we start from the observed mass functions at @xmath498 , then evolve them down to redshift zero by taking into account both dry mergers and accretion in the continuity equation .",
    "the effect of dry mergers is evaluated numerically with a mid - point scheme computation that divides the overall timegrid in sufficiently small steps @xmath499 , and then evolves the mass function at each timestep @xmath500 according to @xmath501 where @xmath502 is the probability of dry mergers .",
    "we adopt the common simplifying assumption that dry merging of the associated stellar and bh components follows halo mergers of given mass ratio .",
    "we base on the dm merging rates provided by stewart et al .",
    "( 2009 ) via high - resolution @xmath5body simulations , and write @xmath503 where @xmath212 specifies the mass ratio above which mergers are considered ; thus @xmath504 is the probability of major mergers , while @xmath505 is that of minor mergers .",
    "the results on the bh and stellar mass functions are illustrated in fig .",
    "b1 and b2 .",
    "the impact of dry mergers on the mass functions is apparent only at the high mass end .",
    "dry mergers increase moderately the space densities of bhs with mass @xmath506 and boost that of stellar masses @xmath507 , ranges where data are still statistically uncertain and/or affected by large systematics .    specifically , assuming that a dry merger follows any dm halo merger ( either major or minor ) yields a local bh mass function still consistent with data , even considering the uncertainties on the bolometric corrections in converting from luminosity to mass ( cf .",
    "[ sec|bh_results ] ) . on the other hand , while major dry merger produce a stellar mass function consistent with the data ( see also liu et al .",
    "2015 ) , this is not the case for minor dry mergers . all that implies that the addition of stellar mass by ( minor ) dry mergers following the dm halos must be only partial , possibly depending on mass ratio , orbital parameters , tidal stripping , and structural properties ( see naab et al . 2009 ; krogager et al .",
    "in this appendix we stress the importance of the fir , in addition to the uv , data in probing the star formation process in high - redshift galaxies .    to this purpose , we present in fig .",
    "[ fig|star_uvlf ] the sfr luminosity function estimated on the basis of dust - uncorrected uv data , dust - corrected uv data , and uv+fir data .",
    "it is evident that , even when dust - corrected according to the prescriptions described in sect .",
    "[ sec|star_lf ] , uv data strongly undersample the bright end of the luminosity function .",
    "for example , at @xmath361 the number of sources with @xmath508 yr@xmath11 , which is not an extreme but rather a typical value , is estimated to be @xmath301 mpc@xmath13 from uv+fir data , while it is inferred to be @xmath509 mpc@xmath13 from dust - corrected uv data , and would be @xmath510 mpc@xmath13 from dust - uncorrected uv data . we stress that especially at @xmath511 , the dust corrections routinely applied to the uv data are unable to fully account for the population of strongly starforming galaxies seen in the fir band .    in fig .",
    "[ fig|star_uvmf ] we illustrate the stellar mass function obtained via the continuity equation from the above input luminosity functions .",
    "we keep the same lightcurve of our fiducial model , that for uv - bright , low - luminosity objects yields a duration of the burst already close to the hubble time .",
    "as it can be seen , when basing only on uv data ( even if dust - corrected ) the high mass end of the resulting stellar mass function is substantially underpredicted relative to the fir+uv results ( which well reproduces observational estimates , see fig .",
    "[ fig|star_mf ] ) at any redshift .",
    "note that this mismatch can hardly be recovered by mass additions from dry merging events , since a factor @xmath192 in mass is needed from @xmath512 to @xmath188 .",
    "here we provide analytic fits to the relationships derived from the abundance matching technique . to fit a relation of the form @xmath513 we adopt a double powerlaw shape : @xmath514^{\\alpha(z)}+\\left[{m\\over m_b(z)}\\right]^{\\omega(z)}\\right\\}^{\\theta}~,\\ ] ] with @xmath515 for a convex or @xmath516 for a concave relationship .",
    "the normalization @xmath517 , the mass of the break @xmath518 , and the characteristic slopes @xmath109 and @xmath110 evolve with the redshift according to the same parametrization @xmath111 with @xmath519 and @xmath113 . the parameter values are reported in table  2 .",
    "these expressions can be exploited to interpolate and/or extrapolate the relationships all the way from @xmath188 to @xmath193 .",
    "interpolation is helpful to produce mock galaxy and agn / bh catalogs that can be used to compute gravitational lensing effects , to investigate clustering properties , to gauge sub - grid physics in numerical simulations , and to design observational setups . on the other hand",
