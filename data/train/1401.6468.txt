    "this work is motivated by a series of experiments @xcite performed in the 1980 s in which borner and collaborators forced superfluid helium ( @xmath0he ) through the circular orifice of a cylindrical tube ( diameter @xmath1 ) by the single stroke of a piston , at temperatures between @xmath2 and @xmath3 above absolute zero . using acoustic methods , borner _",
    "_ determined size , position , velocity and superfluid circulation of the localised vortex structure which was ejected from the tube s orifice .",
    "their finding that velocity and circulation remained reproducibly constant during the evolution suggested that the vortex structure maintained its identity and travelled coherently .    to appreciate the significance of borner s result , we recall @xcite that the flow of superfluid helium is potential ( in a quantum fluid , the velocity is proportional to the gradient of the phase of the quantum mechanical wave function ) .",
    "superfluid vorticity exists only in the form of thin vortex lines of atomic thickness ( the radius of the vortex core is @xmath4 ) and fixed circulation @xmath5 proportional to planck s constant .",
    "the superfluid literature is familiar @xcite with individual vortex rings , ranging in diameter from approximately one micron ( for rings generated by a high voltage tip @xcite ) to half a millimetre ( as recently visualized by bewley and sreenivasan @xcite ) .",
    "however , the circulation @xmath6 observed by borner was much larger than the quantum of circulation @xmath7 : they reported values in the range from @xmath8 to @xmath9 depending on piston s stroke , velocity and temperature . according to borner",
    ", the cylinder - piston arrangement generates a macroscopic , self - propelling , toroidal vortex structure - some kind of large - scale vortex ring .",
    "the natural interpretation is that such structure actually consists of a toroidal bundle of @xmath10 individual vortex rings of the same polarity travelling in the same direction at close distance from each other , hence interacting strongly but remaining coherent during the observed evolution over a distance of about @xmath11 .",
    "borner s interpretation was strengthened by further experiments performed by murakami and collaborators @xcite . using a cylinder - piston arrangement of the same size as borner s , murakami _ et al .",
    "_ succeeded in visualizing borner s large - scale vortex ring and tracking its motion by means of frozen hydrogen - deuterium particles trapped in the cores of individual vortex rings .",
    "stamm and collaborators @xcite also generated large - scale vortex rings in liquid helium , but using a different technique ( second - sound heat pulses ) , which resulted in vortex structures less stable than borner s and murakami s .",
    "unfortunately the experiments of borner , murakami and stamm were not followed up and became almost forgotten .",
    "today the situation has changed .",
    "current experimental , numerical and theoretical work is concerned with similarities between superfluid turbulence and ordinary turbulence . in particular ,",
    "the energy spectrum @xcite which is observed in turbulent superfluid helium obeys the same kolmogorov scaling of ordinary turbulence .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that this property arises from the partial polarization of superfluid vortex lines . the existence of bundles of vortices in turbulent helium is also debated @xcite , in analogy with the  worms \" which are responsible for the intermittency of ordinary turbulence @xcite .",
    "issues raised by borner s and murakami s experiments , such as the interaction of vortex lines , their polarization , coherence and stability , have thus become important .",
    "moreover , borner s cylinder - piston arrangement is a convenient configuration to study polarized vortex lines under controlled experimental conditions .",
    "thus motivated , we revisit borner s and murakami s experiments . our work is not to model the experiments precisely , or to perform linear stability calculations ( it is not even clear what should be the state to perturb ) .",
    "we simply want to gain qualitative insight into the three - dimensional motion and stability of a number of coaxial , thin cored vortex rings arranged in the shape of a toroidal bundle , as envisaged by borner .",
    "will such a vortex configuration travel a significant distance ( larger than its diameter ) in a coherent way , before becoming unstable , or will vortex interactions destroy the structure straight away ?",
    "borner s experiment has another interesting fluid dynamics aspect .",
    "it is well - known that two coaxial vortex rings of the same polarity , when close to each other , execute a peculiar leapfrogging motion @xcite : the ring behind shrinks , speeds up , goes inside the ring which was ahead , overtakes it , grows in size , slows down , and then the process repeats in a periodic fashion . for a toroidal bundle of many ( @xmath12 ) vortex rings to remain coherent ,",
    "some kind of generalized leapfrogging motion is likely to take place .",
    "before we finish this introduction , we recall @xcite the classical expressions for the velocity @xmath13 and the energy ( per unit density ) @xmath14 of a vortex ring of radius @xmath15 :    @xmath16    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the core radius and @xmath6 is the circulation ; the quantities @xmath19 and @xmath20 depend on the assumed vortex core structure @xcite .",
    "for hollow core we have @xmath21 and @xmath22 ; for core rotating at uniform angular velocity as a solid  body ( rankine vortex ) we have @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xcite . for a single quantum vortex ring ,",
    "the quantities @xmath6 and @xmath18 must be replaced by the quantum of circulation @xmath7 and the superfluid vortex core radius @xmath25 ( proportional to the superfluid healing length ) . for borner",
    "s large - scale vortex ring structure , which we model as a torus , @xmath15 will be the major radius of the torus and @xmath18 the minor radius .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we ignore the thermal excitations which make up helium s normal fluid @xcite .",
    "this approximation is justified by the fact that , at the lowest temperature explored by borner , the normal fluid fraction is only 4.5 percent of the total density @xcite . in this low temperature limit , friction is negligible @xcite and vortex lines move with the superfluid .",
    "we are thus in the limit of classical euler dynamics .",
    "we represent vortex lines as three - dimensional , closed space curves @xmath26 of infinitesimal thickness and circulation @xmath7 moving in an inviscid , incompressible euler fluid .",
    "the curves are parametrised by arc length @xmath27 and evolve in time @xmath28 in an infinite computational domain according to the biot - savart law @xcite    @xmath29    where the line integral extends over the entire vortex configuration @xmath30 .",
    "vortex reconnections are forbidden by euler dynamics , but are possible for quantum vortices @xcite .",
    "therefore we supplement eq .",
    "[ eq : bs ] with an algorithmic reconnection procedure which changes the topology of the vortex configuration when the distance between two filaments is less than a prescribed cutoff value . in the next sections ,",
    "when describing results , we shall state explicitly whether vortex reconnections have taken place or not ; in this way we shall distinguish the aspects of our problem which refer to classical eulerian fluid dynamics from the aspects which ( since reconnections have taken place ) are relevant only to superfluid liquid helium .",
    "the numerical techniques which we use to discretize the vortex lines , compute their evolution and de - singularize the biot - savart integral ( using the superfluid vortex core radius @xmath31 ) are described in our previous papers @xcite . here",
    "it suffices to recall that the relative distance between discretization points along filaments is held approximately between @xmath32 and @xmath33 where @xmath32 represents the prescribed numerical resolution . to make direct comparison with related vortex filament calculations performed by schwarz @xcite and tsubota & adachi @xcite we run our simulations with vortex core cutoff corresponding to uniformly rotating solid  body core , and find good agreement @xcite .",
    "the reconnection algorithm , triggered when the vortex separation is closer than @xmath33 , was described by baggaley @xcite who compared it to other algorithms used in the liquid helium literature .",
    "a more microscopic model based on the gross - pitaevskii equation for a bose - einstein condensate suggests that at each reconnection a small amount of kinetic energy is turned into sound @xcite . to account for this effect , at each reconnection",
    "the algorithm reduces the total vortex length ( used as a proxy for energy ) , whereas , in the absence of reconnections , according to eulerian dynamics the energy is conserved during the evolution .",
    "our model is based on the assumption that , apart from isolated reconnection events , the vortex filaments are usually far from each other compared to the vortex core thickness @xmath31 .",
    "this assumption is justified by the following argument : let @xmath15 and @xmath18 be respectively the major and minor radius of the toroidal structure generated by the piston in borner s experiment ; using eq .",
    "[ eq : v ] and the observed values of @xmath6 and @xmath13 , we estimate the minor radius of the torus , @xmath18 , and find that the typical distance between vortex lines , @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 is the number of vortex lines per unit cross section of the torus ) is indeed many orders of magnitude bigger than @xmath31 .",
    "we do not have enough experimental information about the formation of borner s large - scale helium vortex ring as it rolls out of the orifice .",
    "moreover , the vortex filament method is not suitable for describing the process of vortex nucleation - the gross - pitaevskii nonlinear schroedinger equation should be used instead . even neglecting the formation process near the orifice , we do not know if there is a steady or periodic vortex configuration which travels away from the orifice , whose linear or nonlinear stability can be studied  perhaps there is not , and the problem is essentially an initial value one . for the sake of simplicity , our initial condition consists of @xmath36 coaxial vortex rings lying in the yz - plane within a torus of major radius @xmath15 and minor radius @xmath18 , oriented to travel in the x - direction .. for @xmath37",
    "the rings are arranged in a hexagonal pattern on the cross section of the torus such that each successive hexagonal layer is at distance @xmath38 further way from the centre than the previous layer .",
    "this configuration is the most energetically favourable for a vortex lattice in a rotating cylinder , as described by donnelly @xcite .",
    "the number of initial vortex rings is thus @xmath39 for @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the layer s number .",
    "@xmath42 is a special case , as the two rings are at the same time co - axial and concentric , lying on the same yz - plane at distance @xmath43 from each other .",
    "@xmath44 is another special case : the cross section has the shape of an equilateral triangle and @xmath45 . in general , for @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "examples of initial conditions with @xmath48 and @xmath49 rings are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "borner and collaborators measured experimentally the large and small radii of the large - scale rings , @xmath15 and @xmath18 , as well as the circulation @xmath6 .",
    "they reported that @xmath50 or slightly larger , consistently with the observation @xcite that , in an ordinary fluid , the ring which is generated by the piston - cylinder arrangement is somewhat larger than the orifice , and that @xmath51 .",
    "the estimated values of the intervortex distance @xmath38 vary from approximately @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "our main computational constraint is the evaluation of biot - savart integrals , which grows with @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the number of discretization points along the vortices .",
    "@xmath55 is determined by the parameter @xmath32 ( the distance between discretization points ) and the total vortex length ( which depends on the number @xmath36 of vortex rings and their radius ) .",
    "clearly @xmath32 must be smaller than the distance between vortex rings , which depends on @xmath36 and @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , to ensure the numerical stability of the evolution , the time step @xmath56 must be small enough to resolve the shortest , fastest - rotating kelvin waves ( helical perturbations along the vortex filaments ) which have wavelength of the order of @xmath32 .",
    "therefore a decrease of @xmath32 requires a decrease of @xmath56 .",
    "this means that , whereas the cost of a single time - step scales as @xmath54 , the cost of computing the evolution up to a given time actually scales as @xmath57 .",
    "we do not have the computing power to compute the long - term evolution of vortex bundles with the very large number of vortex rings of borner s experiments ( @xmath58 ) , but we shall see that the values of @xmath55 which we can afford give us qualitative information about the motion of small vortex bundles , and provide us with insight into the conditions of the experiments .    to test the computer code",
    ", we verify that a single ( @xmath59 ) vortex ring travels at constant energy @xmath14 with steady translational velocity @xmath13 .",
    "the velocity is computed from the time to travel a given distance ( for @xmath60 we track the motion of the centre of vorticity instead ) .",
    "for example , for a single vortex ring of radius @xmath61 with @xmath62 , we find that @xmath63 differs from the value predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) with the rankine core model , @xmath64 , by approximately @xmath65 .",
    "the energy ( per unit density ) is computed using the expression    @xmath66    where we have assumed that the vorticity is concentrated along the vortex filaments and that the velocity goes to zero at infinity . for a single vortex ring ,",
    "we find that energy is conserved to within @xmath67 for typical time scales and length scales investigated .",
    "the case of @xmath42 leapfrogging vortex rings is more challenging because energy conservation is tested under the action of a re - meshing algorithm ( the number of discretization points on a ring changes as the ring grows and shrinks in size ) .",
    "we find that energy is conserved to within @xmath68 .",
    "[ fig:2 ] shows stable leapfrogging of two concentric coaxial rings for a distance of about 40 diameters .",
    "the figure also demonstrates that the motion does not depend on the numerical resolution parameter @xmath32 .",
    "the speed of translation of the vortex bundles is tested by changing the resolution @xmath32 .",
    "for example , consider the bundle of @xmath44 vortex rings with @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath45 , @xmath71 .",
    "using resolution @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) we find that ( with time step @xmath74 ) it travels the distance @xmath75 ( compared to its initial diameter ) in @xmath76 , hence the average speed is @xmath77 .",
    "if we reduce the resolution to @xmath78 ( with @xmath79 ) and @xmath80 ( with @xmath81 ) we find that in both cases it reaches @xmath82 in @xmath83 , which still corresponds to @xmath77 .    finally , we test energy conservation during the evolution of larger vortex bundles ( @xmath84 ) . for the length scales and time scales investigated , we find that the relative error @xmath85 is always well below @xmath86 , provided that no vortex reconnections have taken place .",
    "we now proceed to investigate the motion of bundles of vortex rings with @xmath87 .",
    "the parameters of the simulations are shown in table  [ tab:1 ] . in all runs",
    "we set up the initial condition so that @xmath70 and @xmath69 . for @xmath88 , since @xmath89 , @xmath69 would have meant that @xmath90 , hence @xmath91 , and the leapfrogging motion , at least in two - dimensions , may not be stable @xcite .",
    "therefore , for @xmath88 only , we set @xmath92 and @xmath93 . in all cases",
    "we find that the vortex bundles travel at approximately constant speed without disintegrating , and reach the distance @xmath94 ( observed by borner ) after approximately @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 respectively .",
    "[ fig:3 ] shows the distance travelled , @xmath99 , in units of the initial diameter @xmath100 vs time @xmath28 for toroidal bundles consisting of @xmath101 and @xmath49 vortex rings ; it is apparent that all bundles travel at essentially constant velocity ( the largest bundle slows down slightly ) .",
    "table  [ tab:2 ] gives quantitative information about each simulation : average curvature @xmath102 , translational velocity @xmath13 of centre of vorticity , distance travelled @xmath99 in units of the initial diameter @xmath100 , and vortex length @xmath103 .",
    "changes in length and curvature reflect the appearance of kelvin waves along the filaments . the labels  start \" ,  finish \" and  reconnection \" denote the times at which we start and stop a simulation , and the time at which the first vortex reconnection ( if any ) has taken place . as mentioned in section",
    "[ sec : method ] , classical eulerian dynamics breaks down at the first reconnection ; beyond the first reconnection , our results are still valid for superfluid liquid .",
    "as explained in section  [ sec : constraints ] , the available computing power limits our simulations to a number of vortex rings ( up to @xmath88 in the previous subsection ) which is much less than in borner s experiment . to bridge this gap ,",
    "we have performed shorter numerical simulations of only few time steps in order to determine the initial instantaneous velocity of vortex bundles with experimentally realistic values of @xmath36 , up to @xmath104 , the first @xmath105 hexagonally centred number .",
    "the limitation of this comparison is that the vortex bundle does not have time to distort its initially circular shape and acquire the slightly elliptical cross section which we observe in long - term simulations .",
    "[ fig:4](a ) shows that the translational velocity @xmath13 determined numerically in this way for large vortex bundles ( red circles ) is in good agreement with borner s experiments ( black squares and diamonds ) .    in the limit @xmath106 ,",

    "[ fig:4](a , b ) , calculated for the hollow core model , shows that this model is indeed a good approximation .      the coherent motion of the vortex bundles which we obtain ( before instabilities and reconnections occur ) results from a generalised form of the familiar , ordinary leapfrogging of @xmath42 vortex rings .",
    "as the toroidal vortex structure moves along its axis , the individual vortex rings at the back of the torus shrink and slip through the middle , speeding up their translational velocity ; then they grow in size , slow down , and move round the outer part of the torus .",
    "the ordinary leapfrogging of @xmath42 vortex rings is demonstrated in fig .",

    "it is apparent that the trajectories of the vortices in the cross - sectional plane are not circular but elliptical .",
    "[ fig:7 ] shows three - dimensional images of the @xmath44 vortex bundle during its evolution .",
    "this and other three - dimensional images have been prepared using bob scharein s _ knotplot _ software @xcite .",

    "[ fig:8 ] ,  [ fig:9 ] and  [ fig:10 ] . the evolution is qualitatively the same for all values of @xmath36 .",
    "[ fig:10 ] shows the cross - section of an @xmath88 bundle at different times : clearly the motion of individual vortex lines on the plane is more disordered .",
    "it must be stressed that , after the first reconnection , the meaning of the term leapfrogging is lost : the number of vortex rings may not remain constant , as the constituent vortex rings do not have a well - defined identity any longer .      over @xmath111 years ago , love @xcite showed analytically that two vortex - antivortex pairs ( the two - dimensional analogue of two coaxial vortex rings ) will perform leapfrogging motion only if the parameter @xmath112 , defined as the ratio of diameters of the smaller to the larger pair , satisfies the condition @xmath113 .",
    "if @xmath114 , leapfrogging does not occur : the smaller , faster ring escapes the influence of the larger , slower ring and disappears off to infinity .",
    "more recently , using numerical methods , acheson @xcite extended love s work and identified three regimes : ( i ) when @xmath115 leapfrogging does not occur ; ( ii ) when @xmath116 leapfrogging is possible , but is unstable .",
    "( iii ) when @xmath117 , leapfrogging occurs without instabilities : the system is unaffected by small perturbations .",
    "the comparison of love s and acheson s two - dimensional work with our three - dimensional calculation raises the question as to whether there exists a critical @xmath112 for a system of @xmath42 ( initially ) coplanar , coaxial rings , and , if so , what is its value .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations to identify the range of leapfrogging for @xmath42 in our three - dimensional case .",
    "we use the criterion that leapfrogging occurs only when @xmath118 is non - zero : if @xmath112 is such that @xmath119 the vortex rings have moved so far apart that one ring has no effect on the other . to make connection to the two - dimensional work of love and acheson we relate their parameter @xmath112 to our @xmath120 , obtaining    @xmath121    to determine the range in which @xmath122 ( hence @xmath123 ) lies",
    ", first we proceed by fixing @xmath15 and varying @xmath18 , then by fixing @xmath18 and varying @xmath15 , obtaining the same results .",
    "we conclude that @xmath124 or , equivalently , @xmath125 , as opposed to @xmath126 in acheson s and love s two - dimensional case .",
    "three - dimensional leapfrogging seems more robust than two - dimensional one .",
    "table  [ tab:2 ] shows that the @xmath110 and @xmath88 vortex bundles underwent reconnections before reaching the distance @xmath127 relevant to borner s experiment , but nevertheless remained coherent and travelled at essentially the same constant speed up to this distance , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . in this section",
    "we examine in more detail the long - term evolution of perturbations .",

    "we find that the vortex rings retain their circular coaxial shapes up to about @xmath128 when a long - wavelength kelvin wave starts to grow and eventually causes a vortex reconnection between vortex lines which are almost parallel to each other ( in other words , the angle @xmath129 between the unit tangent vectors @xmath130 to the two reconnecting vortex lines is small ) . despite the reconnection ,",
    "the circular symmetry of the vortex configuration is not much altered .",
    "an observer tracking the position and velocity of the vortex structure would not notice any change .    in the absence of damping , the short - wavelength perturbations induced by the reconnection cusp travel around the vortex lines which were affected by the reconnection , and induce similar waves on neighboring vortex lines ( an effect which we have described in a previous paper  @xcite ) . the amount of kelvin waves is quantified by the average curvature , which grows rapidly .",
    "the numerical algorithm has therefore to increase the number of discretization points ( as shown in table  [ tab:3 ] ) .",
    "more reconnections take place , altering the total number of vortex rings in the bundle . at around @xmath131 short - wavelength perturbations",
    "are visible on the entire vortex bundle , becoming the dominant feature , but still the velocity has not changed significantly yet . because of the kelvin waves , the vortex rings are not coplanar any longer , and the vortex length grows significantly .",
    "we know from previous work that large - amplitude kelvin waves on individual vortex rings slow down the ring s translational motion @xcite , and a similar effect seems to take place here : when the perturbations are large enough , the vortex bundle slows down significantly . at this late stage of the evolution",
    "the vortex bundle has lost most of its symmetry , the number of vortex rings is less than the initial @xmath110 , and the structure consists of wiggly , disordered toroidal coils . during the last stage of the evolution",
    ", the angle between reconnecting filaments tends to be larger ( note fig .",
    "[ fig:12](i ) , where some vortex strands are almost perpendicualr to each other ) , further scrambling the vortex structure .",
    "this scenario seems generic : we find it at other values of parameters and for vortex bundles with a different initial number of rings .",
    "we have computed numerically the evolution of bundles of thin - cored , inviscid vortex filaments , using parameters motivated by the experiments in superfluid helium by borner and murakami .",
    "we have found that these toroidal vortex structures are relatively robust .",
    "they travel at constant speed ( which we have modelled in a simple way ) and remain coherent for distances which are larger than their own size , confirming the interpretation of the experiments of borner @xcite and murakami @xcite . the individual vortex rings which make up the bundles execute a collective form of leapfrogging motion , moving inside and then outside the other rings , which generalizes the well - known leapfrogging of two vortex rings .",
    "the evolution of these vortex structures is not much affected by the presence of kelvin waves on individual vortex strands and by vortex reconnections - the translational velocity remains approximately the same .",
    "only when the disturbances are large and these large - scale vortex rings have been reduced to a few disordered toroidal vortex coils the velocity and shape are affected .",
    "moving away from the parameters of the experiments , we have also found that increasing @xmath120 leads to increased regularity of the generalised leapfrogging motion , and increased stability of the whole vortex structure .",
    "we hope that these results will stimulate further work on the motion and the coherence of vortex filaments .",
    "for example , it would be interesting to investigate the stability of two and three - dimensional bundles analytically , to find whether one should expect stable behaviour for @xmath132 ( the results which we have presented only refer to length scales and time scales of the experiments ) .",
    "it would also be interesting to attempt numerical investigations with a very large number of vortex rings keeping the cross - section of the torus constant ( this computational may require the use of the vortex tree algorithm @xcite recently developed for superfluid turbulence ) .",
    "the natural question is whether the continuous limit of the classical euler equation is achieved by superposing vortex singularities .",
