    "from a mathematical perspective , problems in astrophysical accretion fall under the general class of nonlinear dynamics .",
    "this occasions no surprise , because accretion , after all , describes the dynamics of a compressible astrophysical fluid , and the fundamental governing equations of such a problem are nonlinear in nature  @xcite .",
    "one of the general issues that is addressed in accretion studies is the physics of the accretor itself , whose gravitational attraction sustains the global inflow process .",
    "this is especially important if the accretor is a black hole , which by its very definition is never amenable to any direct physical observation , and , therefore , its properties can only be known by the gravitational influence it exerts on the neighbouring structure of space - time .",
    "if the accretor is a black hole , the infalling matter has to reach the event horizon on a relativistic scale of velocity , and arguments in favour of this contention have , by now , gained widespread currency  @xcite .",
    "given physically sensible boundary conditions , this can only imply that at one stage the flow of matter will become transonic , i.e. its flow speed will grow from subsonic values to supersonic values , and in doing so , it will at some point match the speed of acoustic propagation in the fluid .",
    "this transition can happen continuously , as in smooth transonic solutions  @xcite , or discontinuously , as in shocks  @xcite . in accretion studies both possibilities",
    "have been subjected to concerted investigation .",
    "frequently it happens that the transonic feature is exhibited more than once in the phase portrait of stationary solutions , i.e. the flow will be multitransonic .",
    "this is particularly true in axisymmetric rotational flows  @xcite , as opposed to steady spherically symmetric flows , where , as it is well known , physical transonicity occurs only once  @xcite .",
    "physical transonic solutions can be represented mathematically as critical solutions in the phase plane of the flow , i.e. they are associated with critical points  alternatively known as fixed points or equilibrium points  @xcite .",
    "these solutions may even pass through critical points ( as , for instance , a flow through a saddle point ) .",
    "in this situation much information about various physical properties of accretion processes could be gleaned if these critical points are analysed carefully , which is the central objective of this work .    in this treatment the nonlinear equations describing the steady , inviscid , rotational , axisymmetric flow in the kerr metric , have been tailored to form a first - order autonomous dynamical system  @xcite .",
    "the critical points of the phase trajectories of the flow have been identified first , following which , a linearised study in the neighbourhood of these critical points has been carried out . as a consequence of this exercise ,",
    "a complete and rigorous mathematical classification scheme for the nature of the critical points has been derived , and it has been argued that the critical points can admissibly be only saddle points and centre - type points for the kind of conserved , axisymmetric and rotational flow under study here . while all of these are principally the attributes of the hydrodynamical process itself , the influence of the black hole ( the agent external to the fluid , but driving its flow nonetheless ) has also been noteworthy to the extent that its intrinsic rotational parameter affects the character of multitransonicity in general and the properties of an individual critical point in particular .",
    "this is an important result to have emerged from the study .    as a special case of what has been done in the kerr geometric space - time",
    ", a similar study has also been carried out for the flow in the metric of a non - rotating schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the results are entirely in keeping with the usual expectations formed on the basis of the conclusions drawn from the analysis carried out for the kerr metric .",
    "global understanding of the flow topologies will necessitate a full numerical integration of the nonlinear equations of the flow .",
    "this is never an easy task , but equipped with a clear analytical conception of the local features of the critical points of the flow , it becomes possible to qualitatively anticipate the nature of the global behaviour of solutions .",
    "in fact , if the system has no more than two critical points , then with some knowledge of the physical boundary conditions of the flow , absolutely correct qualitative predictions can be made about the solution topologies  @xcite .    particularly with respect to accretion on to black holes ,",
    "this work follows two earlier works in studying critical properties of accretion solutions , with the aid of the mathematical tools of a dynamical systems approach .",
    "one work was devoted to discussing the behaviour of critical points in a steady , axisymmetric , rotational flow , driven towards the central black hole in the pseudo - schwarzschild framework  @xcite .",
    "the second work dealt with transonicity and its associated aspects in a fully general relativistic , spherically symmetric flow described by the schwarzschild metric  @xcite .",
    "the present work on rotational flows in the kerr metric may be seen as an extension of these earlier efforts , and it gives an example of the relative mathematical ease with which otherwise difficult physical questions in general relativistic fluid dynamical problems may be confronted .",
    "neglecting the self - gravity of this general relativistic , axisymmetric , inviscid , stationary , compressible hydrodynamic flow in the kerr geometric space - time , the conserved equation for the specific flow energy , @xmath0 , can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath1 which is actually the relativistic analogue of bernoulli s equation .",
    "the specific enthalpy , @xmath2 , can be defined as @xmath3 with @xmath4 , which contains the rest mass density and the internal energy , being further given by , @xmath5 the pressure , @xmath6 , is expressed as a function of the density , @xmath7 , through an equation of state , @xmath8 , from which , under conditions of constant entropy , @xmath9 , the speed of sound is defined as @xmath10 all of these establish a connection between the density , @xmath7 , and the speed of sound , @xmath11 , as @xmath12^n , \\ ] ] with @xmath13 , the polytropic index , being defined as @xmath14 .",
    "this will subsequently lead to an expression of the specific enthalpy in terms of @xmath15 as @xmath16    a further definition gives @xmath17 as @xmath18 in which @xmath19 is the radial three - velocity of the corotating fluid  @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath20 is defined as @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in all of these , the fixed parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the sub - keplerian specific angular momentum of the flow and the rotating kerr parameter , respectively . following these definitions , a final expression for the relativistic bernoulli equation will be derived as @xmath26    from the continuity condition , the other governing equation of the flow will be obtained as  @xcite @xmath27 in which the integration constant , @xmath28 , is the physical matter flow rate .",

    "the critical points of these solutions will be derived by the simultaneous vanishing of the right hand side of equation  ( [ dvdr ] ) and the coefficient of @xmath37 in the left hand side .",

    "following this , some simple algebraic manipulations , with the help of the definition of @xmath42 will make it possible to express @xmath43 entirely as a function of @xmath44 , and this will be given by @xmath45 it will then be possible , with the aid of either equation  ( [ critcon1 ] ) or equation  ( [ critcon2 ] ) , to express @xmath41 as a function of @xmath44 only , and all these conditions , substituted in equation  ( [ bernou ] ) , will deliver the roots of @xmath44 in terms of @xmath0 , @xmath24 , @xmath46 and @xmath25 .",
    "the critical points will , therefore , become fixed in the @xmath35  @xmath36 plane .",
    "quite frequently for any nonlinear physical system , a linearised analytical study of the properties of the fixed points affords a robust platform for carrying out an investigation to understand the global behaviour of integral solutions in the phase portrait .",
    "this is especially useful in the absence of any well - prescribed and general means of solving nonlinear differential equations , which , perforce , have to be solved numerically .",
    "it has already been shown that the stationary , axisymmetric , rotational flow in the kerr metric can be reduced to a first - order autonomous system , and as such it lends itself easily to a dynamical systems study of its fixed points .",
    "to do so , it should be necessary to decompose equation  ( [ dvdr ] ) into two parametrized equations , given by @xmath47 -\\frac{f^{\\prime}}{f } \\nonumber \\\\",

    "this kind of parametrization represents the first step towards carrying out a linear stability analysis of the fixed points of a nonlinear system , and for the present treatment on disc flows in the kerr geometric space - time , this will give a complete classification scheme for the critical points of the flow .",

    "they could not have been very different , since the treatment on flows in the schwarzschild metric is anyway a special case of the flow in kerr space - time .",
    "nevertheless , flows in schwarzschild geometry merit a separate investigation in their own right , and indeed , for spherically symmetric flows , this special case affords a very clear pedagogical model to understand various accretion - related phenomena , with some surprisingly new features revealed  @xcite .",
    "in the two foregoing sections , it has been discussed that for the disc flow in the kerr metric ( and for its schwarzschild limit as well ) , the eigenvalues of the stability matrix associated with each of the critical points can be fixed in terms of the relevant parameters of the flow @xmath0 , @xmath24 , @xmath46 and @xmath25 .",
    "this obviously implies that the critical behaviour of the flow can actually be determined by these parameters .",
    "multitransonicity is one very important critical feature of the flow and its dependence on the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath24 in this kerr geometric system ( for fixed values of @xmath46 and @xmath25 ) has been depicted in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] .",
    "the region marked by @xmath86 corresponds to a single outer critical point at large length scales .",
    "this occurs for low values of @xmath24 and @xmath0 .",
    "it is not difficult to intuitively grasp the reason for this .",
    "gravity drives the accretion process , and this is manifested by the growth of the velocity field . in a rotating flow",
    "angular momentum acts against the interest of gravity , and depending on the strength of the presence of angular momentum , the velocity field will develop accordingly .",
    "criticality in the flow is achieved when its velocity matches the speed of acoustic propagation in the fluid . the resistance raised due to the presence of low angular momentum in the rotating fluid",
    "can , therefore , be overcome even at large distances ( where gravity is comparatively weak ) . besides this",
    ", a low value of @xmath0 will imply that the compressible fluid is  cold \" and as such it can not offer much of a resistance against gravity with the help of its internal thermal effects .",
    "and so once again gravity wins easily , with criticality developing at large length scales .",
    "all of these features are manifested in the region marked @xmath86 in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] .",
    "on the other hand , when both @xmath0 and @xmath24 are high , their resistive effects can only be overcome with the rotating fluid having to fall deeper within the potential well , and , therefore , criticality can be attained only at small length scales , in the vicinity of the event horizon of the black hole .",
    "this feature has been shown in the region ( corresponding to higher values of @xmath24 and @xmath0 ) marked @xmath87 in fig .",
    "all of these arguments can be appreciated much more easily for rotational flows in the non - relativistic and newtonian representation .",
    "one might expect that the qualitative character of the physics in this regime , should also carry over smoothly to the general relativistic case .",
    "at least the parameter space representation in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] does nothing to make one believe otherwise , because a similar pattern is also exhibited for non - relativistic pseudo - newtonian flows  @xcite .",
    "the multitransonic aspect of the flow has been shown by the wedge - shaped region in fig .",
    "this region has been further subdivided into two regions , marked by @xmath88 ( accretion ) and @xmath89 ( wind ) . to gain an understanding of the physical criterion behind this subdivision",
    ", it should be necessary first to go to equation  ( [ emdot ] ) , and then substitute @xmath7 in it in terms of @xmath90 , with the help of equation  ( [ conden ] ) .",
    "this process will lead to the defining of a new parameter for the flow , @xmath91 .",
    "this newly defined parameter is physically understood to be the entropy accretion rate .",
    "now multitransonicity in this kerr geometric flow implies the existence of three critical points , and under the fundamental physical requirement of accretion being a process whereby a flow solution should connect infinity to the event horizon of the black hole , the three critical points should be such that there would be two saddle points flanking a centre - type point between themselves .",
    "going back to fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , the criterion to distinguish region @xmath88 ( the accretion region ) will be that the entropy accretion rate , @xmath92 , through the inner saddle point must be greater than the corresponding flow rate , @xmath93 , through the outer saddle point .",
    "the exact reversal of this argument , i.e. @xmath94 , will define the region @xmath89 ( the wind region ) in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] .",
    "the former situation can be understood very clearly from fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , in which the integral solutions of equation  ( [ dvdr ] ) have been drawn under various boundary conditions .",
    "the vertical axis plots @xmath95 ( with @xmath96 , the mach number , being defined as @xmath97 ) against the radial distance along the horizontal axis .",
    "the behaviour of the solution passing through the inner saddle point , @xmath98 , ( whose associated value of @xmath99 is greater than its corresponding value for the outer saddle point , @xmath100 ) is most interesting .",
    "it connects the point @xmath98 to itself through a loop , and hence , to invoke the terminology of plane autonomous dynamical systems , this solution is actually a homoclinic path  @xcite .    while fig .",
    "[ f2 ] depicts the actual behaviour of the phase trajectories corresponding to the wedge - shaped region marked by @xmath88 in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , the converse behaviour of these trajectories , corresponding to the region @xmath89 ( wind ) has been shown in fig .  [ f3 ] .",
    "here the governing principle is that the entropy accretion rate pertaining to the outer saddle point is greater than the one for the inner saddle point ( i.e. @xmath94 ) , and it is evident from the plot that in this situation the solution passing through the outer saddle point , @xmath100 , is a homoclinic path .",
    "so a general conclusion that can be drawn is that for a physical flow such as the one under study here , multitransonicity will imply the existence of a homoclinic path ( which is a flow solution that connects a saddle point to itself ) .",
    "the quantitative physical guideline to identify such a solution is to first identify the saddle point through which the entropy accretion rate , @xmath99 , is greater than what it is for any of the other ones .    for accretion in particular , a long - standing understanding has been that the flow has to take place at the maximum possible rate .",
    "one could go back to a pioneering work in this subject , in which  @xcite had conjectured that since there would be nothing to prevent the accretion process , it might as well take place at the greatest possible rate , implying that the flow would be transonic .",
    "while this conjecture was made on the basis of the spherically symmetric flow , which has a single critical point ( a saddle point ) , it would still be relevant for multitransonic disc flows .",
    "once , after starting under suitable outer boundary conditions , an inflow solution has passed through the outer saddle point , it will then undergo a transition , so that the entropy accretion rate is increased further by the solution passing through the inner saddle point .",
    "this transition will occur through a standing shock , and this process defines an unambiguous path for the infalling matter to reach the event horizon of the black hole .",
    "various studies have dealt with many questions in this regard  @xcite , but these details will be beyond the scope of the present study , which is devoted only to the critical aspects of the flow .    a further interesting issue related to figs .",
    "[ f2 ] and  [ f3 ] is that in broad qualitative terms , one is evidently a reversed image of the other . while the solutions in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] are characterised by @xmath101 through the saddle points , the defining criterion for solutions in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] is @xmath94 .",
    "it will then be reasonable to suggest that the accreting system will go through a state in which @xmath102 .",
    "since integral solutions are allowed to intersect only at the critical points of a dynamical system  @xcite , this will mean that for the condition @xmath102 , the two saddle points in the phase portrait will be connected by two heteroclinic paths only  @xcite .",
    "drawing the phase solutions in this situation , however , will entail a tuning of the flow parameters ( and the boundary conditions ) with infinite numerical precision , something that should be quite impossible in practice . in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] the curve separating region @xmath88 from region @xmath89 depicts the condition for heteroclinicity . as a matter of fact ,",
    "this curve , as well as the two other curves bounding the multitransonic region in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , can all be viewed as the loci of various kinds of bifurcation points  @xcite .",
    "so far the discussion has dwelt on the critical properties of the flow for a fixed value of the kerr rotating parameter , @xmath25 .",
    "it should now be instructive to consider how the variation of @xmath25 affects the critical properties , because , for the case of a rotating black hole , apart from its mass ( which defines all length scales in the flow ) , its spin parameter will also leave its imprint on the physics of the accretion process . in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] , the way in which the spin parameter influences multitransonicity has been shown .",
    "the dotted curves delineate the region of multitransonicity in the @xmath24  @xmath0 parameter space for @xmath73 ( i.e. the schwarzschild limit ) .",
    "the continuous curves indicate the multitransonic region for @xmath103 .",
    "it is very obvious that the onset of multitransonicity takes place at lower values of @xmath24 for prograde flows ( implied by @xmath104 ) . besides this , the multitransonic region is also stretched to higher values of @xmath0 .",
    "all of these lead to the understanding that the kerr spin parameter ( for prograde flows at least ) favourably affects the multitransonic character of the flow .",
    "various general aspects of multitransonicity have been considered in detail by now . to derive some quantitative insight about the specific properties of an individual critical point ,",
    "however , it will be necessary to go further . the first thing to do in this regard",
    "will be to examine the behaviour of the eigenvalues of the stability matrix associated with each critical point .",
    "this has to be done by going back to equation  ( [ eigen ] ) , which gives a dependence of @xmath72 on the critical point coordinates .",
    "these coordinates , in their turn , have a dependence on the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath24 , @xmath46 and @xmath25 . keeping the last two parameters fixed at @xmath105 and @xmath103 ,",
    "the variation of @xmath72 with respect to @xmath0 and @xmath24 , has been plotted in figs .",
    "[ f5 ] ,  [ f6 ] and  [ f7 ] , for the inner , the middle and the outer critical points , respectively . in all these three surface plots the lightly shaded area ( coloured red in the online version ) represents accretion , while the dark area ( coloured blue in the online version ) represents wind",
    ". it will not be difficult to appreciate that all the three surfaces in figs .",
    "[ f5 ] ,  [ f6 ] and  [ f7 ] will have a two - dimensional projection on the @xmath24  @xmath0 plot given in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] .",
    "the sign of @xmath72 indicates the nature of a critical point .",
    "when @xmath72 is positive , it will imply the existence of a saddle point . and",
    "so from figs .",
    "[ f5 ] and  [ f7 ] , with @xmath72 being positive all the time in these two plots , it is very much evident that the inner and the outer critical points are saddle points for a multitransonic flow . which is exactly how it should be to make the whole accretion process feasible , because otherwise there will be no open path connecting the event horizon of the black hole and the outer boundary of the flow ( which",
    ", mathematically speaking , will be at infinity ) .",
    "having made a note of this qualitative similarity between these two critical points , the quantitative differences will also have to be stressed .",
    "the first difference is that the respective values of @xmath72 for either saddle point , differ from those of the other by orders of magnitude .",
    "the inner saddle point behaves more robustly in this regard .",
    "a further difference is that while @xmath72 decreases slightly with increasing @xmath0 ( at a fixed value of @xmath24 ) for the inner saddle point ( as fig .",
    "[ f5 ] shows ) , the trend is quite the opposite for the outer saddle point . here ,",
    "for a fixed value of @xmath24 , there is a growth pattern for @xmath72 with increasing @xmath0 , as fig .",
    "[ f7 ] indicates .",
    "this growth is quite noticeable when the value of @xmath24 is small . for high values of @xmath0 , however , there is a sharp dip .",
    "as opposed to both the critical points in the extremeties , the critical point in the middle is always a centre - type point , a fact that is indicated by the negative values of @xmath72 , given in fig .  [ f6 ] . once again , like the outer saddle point , @xmath72 increases with increasing @xmath0 , at a fixed value of @xmath24 .    while figs .",
    "[ f5 ] ,  [ f6 ] and  [ f7 ] indicate a dependence of @xmath72 on @xmath0 and @xmath24 for fixed values of @xmath25 and @xmath46 , it will also be necessary to see how @xmath72 varies with @xmath25 , having all other parameters fixed",
    ". this will reveal how the mathematical properties of the critical points are affected by an intrinsic physical property of the black hole .",
    "this has been quantitatively represented in figs .",
    "[ f8 ] ,  [ f9 ] and  [ f10 ] .",
    "the two critical points in the extremeties are , of course , saddle points , but once again , in quantitative terms , they behave in a manner contrary to each other . while , for the inner saddle point , @xmath72 grows with increasing values of @xmath25 ( shown in fig .  [ f8 ] ) , there is a steady decline in the magnitude of @xmath72 for the outer saddle point ( shown in fig .",
    "[ f10 ] ) .",
    "so , physically speaking , while the presence of the kerr parameter augments the properties of the inner saddle point , at the same time it has an opposite effect on the outer saddle point .",
    "both these features are , however , manifested in the case of the centre - type point , for which @xmath72 decreases initially with increasing @xmath25 , reaches a minimum value ( near @xmath106 ) , and then starts to increase .",
    "these have all been shown in fig .",
    "while stationary flows are interesting enough , studying the dynamic aspects of the accretion problem reveals new insight related to transonicity , specifically its long - time evolutionary properties and its stability under linearised time - dependent perturbations .",
    "these are relatively less complicated ventures to undertake for black hole accretion in the pseudo - schwarzschild regime , which essentially preserves the simplicity of the newtonian construct of space and time  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown for accreting systems , both spherically symmetric and axisymmetric , that generating solutions through a saddle point needs infinitely precise fine - tuning of the boundary condition , but the flow easily attains transonicity if its evolution is traced through time  @xcite . while it may be proposed that this treatment can be extended to proper general relativistic flows , it must also be noted that involving explicit time dependence in a general relativistic fluid flow is always a formidable mathematical problem , more so if the flow is compressible and rotating .",
    "if , on the other hand , this could indeed be achieved successfully , then a whole host of interesting new features would emerge .",
    "one issue , related particularly to multitransonic flows ( which arguably will involve more than one saddle point ) , is the kind of solution that the temporal evolution will select , that is to say which saddle point will the flow finally choose to reach the event horizon of the black hole , and the physical selection criterion thereof . in this connection other questions like variability and chaotic behaviour  @xcite in the flow might also conceivably be brought to the fore .",
    "this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system .",
    "s. goswami and s. n. khan would like to acknowledge the kind hospitality provided by hri , allahabad , india , under a visiting students research programme .",
