    "the existence and detection for both stellar mass black holes as well as supermassive black holes are commonly accepted and recognized in the astronomical community @xcite .",
    "intermediate mass black holes ( imbh ) , i.e. black holes with mass in the @xmath2 range , possibly formed by runaway mergers of massive stars @xcite are expected to fill in the mass range from stellar to supermassive bh .",
    "indeed , evidence for the presence of imbh in star cluster is accumulating , but so far there are only two globular clusters - _ m15 _ and _ g1 _ - that present observational evidence for the existence of imbh @xcite .",
    "the cases for the presence of imbh are based on the challenging determination of the precise kinematics of the systems , that has to be compared with detailed dynamical models in order to infer the presence of the central bh . at the level of velocity dispersion and full line of sight velocity dispersion profiles , the _ direct _ dynamical influence of an imbh",
    "is limited within the sphere of influence of the bh , hard to resolve observationally ( but see the recent high - resolution hst survey carried out by @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the intrinsic three dimensional density ( and velocity dispersion ) cusp around the central bh is smeared out when the data are projected along the line of sight .",
    "however , even if the direct dynamical signature of a central bh is hard to detect observationally , the presence of an imbh at the center of a collisional stellar systems has profound consequences on the global dynamics .",
    "in particular the visual appearance of a globular clusters hosting an imbh is that of a system with a sizeable core @xcite and not that of very concentrated cluster , as could be naively inferred from the existence of the bahcall - wolf @xmath3 density cusp @xcite within the sphere of influence of the bh .",
    "this is because the presence of a central bh and of its compact density cusps generates , through stellar encounters , a sufficient amount of energy to halt the core collapse , if the initial conditions start with a wide core , or to fuel a core expansion if the initial configuration is centrally concentrated . in @xcite",
    "we have shown that star clusters with a central imbh starting from a variety of initial stellar density profiles ( i.e. king models with concentration parameter @xmath4 as well as plummer models ) all evolve toward a common value of the core to half mass radius ratio ( @xmath5 ) on a timescale of a few initial half - mass relaxation times .",
    "this is indeed not surprisingly : a similar behavior is observed when primordial binaries are the responsible driver for energy production in the center of the cluster @xcite , in agreement with the theoretical expectation formulated by @xcite . as binaries alone",
    "are less efficient at producing energy than an imbh , in this case we have @xmath6 ( where the upper limit is reached in presence of a number density of at least @xmath7 binaries in the core ) for a typical globular cluster .",
    "only when no or little binaries are present there can be a deep core collapse , ending when @xmath8 ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .    given this theoretical framework , the observed core to half mass radius ratio appears indeed a powerful indicator of the dynamical configuration of the core of an `` old '' globular cluster , i.e. a globular cluster that has evolved for about @xmath9 to @xmath10 half - mass relaxation times .",
    "@xmath0 is in addition a relatively easy photometric measurement , that can be applied even to extra - galactic globular clusters , without worrying about the need of a very accurate measure .",
    "in fact , the combination of numerical simulations and theoretical modeling predicts that this ratio increases by about a factor @xmath11 moving from clusters with single stars only to clusters with a sizeable population of binaries ; when an imbh is present @xmath0 is @xmath12 to @xmath9 times larger than in the case when only binaries are present and @xmath13 to @xmath14 times larger than when the cluster contains single stars only .    in this letter we present a preliminary application of the use of @xmath0 as an indirect indicator for the presence of an imbh in the cores of 57 galactic globular clusters that satisfy a conservative dynamical age criterion ,",
    "i.e. their half - mass relaxation time is shorter than @xmath15 . in particular",
    ", we show that the observed core to half mass radius ratio in more than half of the clusters in the sample is so large that the only general dynamical explanation can be given in terms of the presence of a central bh .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : picture ] we summarize the current numerical and theoretical understanding of the evolution of @xmath0 , in sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] we present the sample of galactic globular clusters that we use in this analysis and we discuss their properties in terms of our theoretical expectations .",
    "finally we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "as discussed in quantitative detail in a series of paper devoted to the dynamical evolution of star clusters with primordial binaries and imbhs @xcite , the long term evolution of a globular cluster is driven by the heat flow generated in the core of the system toward the halo ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "three main processes can be identified at the base of this heat flow , that regulates the evolution of @xmath0 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rcrh_th ] for representative simulations of our numerical simulations program ) .",
    "( 1 ) when only single stars are present the core behaves as a self - gravitating systems with negative specific heat ( e.g. see @xcite ) and a thermal collapse happens leading to a core contraction .",
    "the core contraction proceeds for about @xmath16 half mass relaxation times for equal mass particles , while it is significantly faster when a mass spectrum is considered @xcite .",
    "the collapse lasts until the central density is so high that a few binaries are dynamically formed by three body encounters .",
    "given the high central density these binaries interact efficiently with single stars and become progressively tighter and tighter providing enough energy to halt the collapse and create a core bounce .",
    "when the number of stars in the system is large enough ( @xmath17 ) binary activity may cause a temporary temperature inversion in the core and subsequent core expansion .",
    "the process is eventually repeated in a series of `` gravothermal oscillations '' @xcite with the core radius oscillating around a value roughly @xmath18 of the half mass radius .",
    "( 2 ) when a sufficient fraction ( i.e. greater than a few percent ) of stars in the cluster has initially a companion with typical separations below @xmath19 ( that is `` hard binaries '' that have a binding energy of at least a few times the total energy of the cluster ) , energy generation due to existing binaries is much more efficient than that due to dynamically formed pairs . here the equilibrium size of the core is larger than when only single stars are present .",
    "the system may even show a core radius expansion if the initial conditions are too concentrated .",
    "the precise value of the equilibrium core radius has a moderate dependence on the number of stars in the systems and on the number density of binaries in the core : @xmath20 for a typical globular cluster ( @xmath21 ) with about @xmath22 of binaries in the core @xcite .",
    "this quasi - equilibrium evolutionary phase lasts until there is a sufficient number of binaries in the core , that is until the binary fraction in the cluster is reduced at a few percent level .",
    "in fact , binaries in the outer part of the cluster tend to sink toward the core for mass segregation , so the core binary fraction is replenished until the total binary fraction is almost exhausted .",
    "( 3 ) when an imbh with mass of the order of @xmath23 of the total mass of the cluster is present , a yet more efficient energy production channel is available in the center of the system via dynamical interactions within the influence sphere of the bh ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "the equilibrium value of the core radius in this case is significantly larger : @xmath5 independently from the initial binary fraction . even in this case",
    "there is an expansion of the core radius on a relaxation timescale if the initial conditions are too concentrated .",
    "this general picture has been obtained with somewhat idealized n - body simulations that employed single particles only and did not take into account stellar evolution .",
    "therefore it is important to assess if the results that we obtain can be biased by our assumptions .",
    "modest deviations from our numerical expectations will not impair the usefulness of @xmath0 as diagnostic tool to infer the presence of imbh , as @xmath0 is expected in this case to be larger by a factor @xmath12 to @xmath9 with respect to the case where only binaries are present .    to ensure that no major bias is present we examine critically the idealizations in the numerical runs :    1 .",
    "_ mass spectrum . _",
    "the choice to use equal mass stars is probably the most significant simplification introduced in our simulations .",
    "when a realistic mass spectrum is present , massive stars segregate on a relaxation timescale toward the core of the system and speed up the core collapse by about one order of magnitude , i.e. the collapse takes about @xmath24 @xcite . in principle , the equilibrium value of the core radius could be changed significantly .",
    "however simulations of the dynamics of star clusters with primordial binaries that include a realistic mass spectrum have been recently performed with a monte carlo code by @xcite and their results on @xmath0 are fully consistent with our more idealized runs .",
    "similarly , realistic simulations of globular clusters with an imbh that include a mass spectrum and stellar evolution ( but without binaries ) have been carried out by @xcite and again the presence of a large core radius is confirmed .",
    "the analysis of the final configuration at @xmath25 of two largest runs by @xcite - with @xmath26 - leads to @xmath27 for the run with a @xcite imf truncated at @xmath28 and @xmath29 when the imf is truncated at @xmath30 .",
    "2 .   _ stellar evolution .",
    "_ our runs do not take into account the effects of stellar evolution , that limits the lifetime of massive stars and may lead to the coalescence of tight binaries .",
    "these effects may possibly lead to a more rapid depletion of the binary population ( see @xcite ) , so that a star cluster would burn out its binary reservoir earlier than expected from our simulations . if this is the case , then the core undergoes a deep core contraction , like in the case where only single stars are present .",
    "the direction of the evolution is fortunately in the right direction to avoid an observational bias when we are interested , as in this paper , to focus on _ large _ values of the core to half mass radius . for simulations with an imbh ,",
    "the study of @xcite ( see point above ) , that included stellar evolution , guarantees instead that the bias due to stellar evolution is not important ( see also fig.1 in @xcite , where the lagrangian radii , that is the radii enclosing a fixed fraction of the total mass of the system , expand steadily starting from a @xmath31 model ) .",
    "_ number of particles .",
    "_ our direct simulations have been limited by cpu speed to employ only up to @xmath32 particles .",
    "the typical number of stars in globular clusters is larger by at least one order of magnitude . given our choice to use equal mass particles and no stellar evolution , our results are scale - free and can be adapted to any physical value for the mass and radius scales . from theoretical considerations by @xcite when primordial binaries are present @xmath0 is expected to have a modest dependence on the number of particles @xmath33 , that is @xmath34 .",
    "simulations with @xmath33 from @xmath35 to @xmath36 indeed verify that the scaling is approximately consistent with the @xcite model @xcite . if anything @xmath37 seems to decrease slightly _ faster _ than expected .",
    "in addition the simulations by @xcite employ a realistic number of particles and their core radii are consistent with our results extrapolated using the @xcite model .",
    "when a imbh is present we do not expect a significant scaling of @xmath0 with @xmath33 as confirmed by our analysis of the two @xmath26 runs of @xcite .",
    "even if a @xmath38 scaling were to be assumed despite the indication from the simulations by @xcite , the core radius value extrapolated from our runs with a imbh would still be such that @xmath39 for a realistic number of particles .",
    "4 .   _ tidal field . _ the runs with an imbh in @xcite do not take into account the presence of a tidal field .",
    "this is however not expected to introduce a significant bias : @xmath0 in runs with primordial binaries varies at the @xmath40 level with or without inclusion of the galactic tidal field @xcite .",
    "_ spherical symmetry . _",
    "our initial conditions are all spherically symmetric .",
    "we do not expect this to be a problem as globular clusters are typically very close to spherical symmetry .",
    "in addition , the precise details of the starting configuration are not important on a collisional timescale . to be sure , in the analysis of the next section we analyze a subsample of the clusters selected by excluding objects that departs from spherical symmetry , obtaining the same @xmath0 distribution as in the parent sample .",
    "6 .   _ rotation . _",
    "the simulations that we consider have zero net angular momentum , i.e. no rotating model is studied .",
    "observational evidence of rotation in globulars is weak and the velocity dispersion tensor displays a mild anisotropy at most @xcite",
    ". therefore it would be very surprinsing if the comparison with observations turns out to be strongly biased by not including rotation in simulations .",
    "finally , before moving on to compare our theoretical expectations for @xmath0 with the data , we have to consider a yet different source of uncertainty .",
    "numerical simulations give us mass - defined core and half - mass radii , while luminosity - based quantities are derived from observations .",
    "a discrepancy can therefore arise ( 1 ) if the luminosity profile does not track accurately the mass profile and/or ( 2 ) if the core radius is differently defined in the two cases .",
    "for the first issue we have to consider that the luminosity of a globular cluster is dominated by stars in the giant branch , that are more massive than the average star of an old globular cluster .",
    "the most luminous stars are more centrally concentrated due to mass segregation than the average , so if a bias is introduced , it goes in the direction of reducing the observed core radius with respect to a mass weighted definition .",
    "however @xcite derive only modest color gradients due to this effect . in any case",
    "it does not affect the interpretation of large observed cores .    the second issue ,",
    "that is a difference between the observational and theoretical core radius definition is also not expected to be a major problem . in our simulations we adopted the density weighted definition of the core radius from @xcite , eq .",
    "iv.3 : @xmath41 where the sum is carried over all the stars in the simulation , @xmath42 is the distance of the i - th star from the center of the system , @xmath43 its mass and @xmath44 the stellar density computed at the star position . this definition for @xmath45 is closely aligned to the standard observational practice of defining the core radius as the radius @xmath46 where the luminosity surface density has dropped to half its central value @xcite .",
    "as a preliminary application of the @xmath0 diagnostic to infer the presence of an imbh , we consider the compilation of galactic globular clusters properties by @xcite , revised in february 2003 .",
    "for each globular cluster in the tables of @xcite we extract the following quantities : ( 1 ) core radius ( @xmath45 ) ; ( 2 ) half - mass radius ( @xmath47 ) ; ( 3 ) tidal radius ( @xmath48 ) ; ( 4 ) half - mass relaxation time ( @xmath1 ) ; ( 5 ) ellipticity ( @xmath49 ) ; ( 6 ) cluster luminosity - i.e. the absolute visual magnitude - ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "we then proceed to build a uniform and homogeneous data set that includes only _ old _ globular clusters to ensure that these systems are well relaxed by two body encounters . as a first step we therefore exclude from the analysis :    1 .   all the globular clusters for which one of these values is not quoted ( except for @xmath49 ) ; 2 .",
    "all the globular clusters with @xmath51 . assuming a typical globular cluster age of @xmath52",
    ", this ensures that all the objects in the sample are at least 10 half mass relaxation times old .",
    "most of the clusters excluded from the sample fail this test ; 3 .",
    "all the cluster that are under the influence of a strong tidal field effects , i.e. those for which @xmath53 . this last selection criterion is mainly a precaution to exclude systems where @xmath54 may start fluctuating as @xmath48 approaches @xmath47 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "only four clusters that pass the previous selections are excluded due to a small tidal radius .    after applying our selection criteria",
    "we are left with a sample of @xmath55 old globular clusters , whose @xmath0 distribution is plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : rcrh_obs ] .",
    "the plot is extremely interesting : it is immediately apparent that only a modest fraction of the globular clusters is characterized by @xmath56 , that would be consistent with the core size expected when the system is populated only by single and binary stars .",
    "the majority of the objects in the sample has a large core ( @xmath57 ) and @xmath58 is not infrequent .",
    "the average value of the ratio is @xmath59 . the median of the distribution is at @xmath60 . from the dynamical considerations of sec .",
    "[ sec : picture ] , only the presence of an imbh appears to be consistent with such large core radius values . in sec .",
    "[ sec : picture ] we have seen that , when the core to half mass radius ratio is set by the burning of binaries there is a modest , logarithmic n - dependence on this ratio , that is reasonably well captured by the @xcite model , especially in presence of a galactic tidal field ( see @xcite ) . to take into account this factor in the analysis",
    "we assume ( 1 ) that the total luminosity is a proxy for the total mass of the system and ( 2 ) that the average stellar mass in each cluster is constant and equal to @xmath61 .",
    "the mass - luminosity relaxation has been checked and calibrated using the data from @xcite .",
    "we used @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we have then corrected the ratio @xmath0 by applying a correction factor @xmath65 @xmath66 so as to obtain a ratio @xmath67 equivalent to that of a cluster with @xmath68 , a standard value in numerical simulations of globular clusters .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig : rcrh_obs ] do not change significantly when this correction is applied : the average value is @xmath69 and the median value of the distribution is @xmath70 , only marginally smaller than without the correction .",
    "the presence of an imbh is therefore still needed to explain the large value of the core radius for at least half the objects in the sample .",
    "could this conclusion be biased by the fact that the observed globular clusters are for some ( improbable ) reasons not yet well relaxed , so that the equilibrium value for @xmath0 has not yet been reached after @xmath71 ? to address this point we enhance our selection algorithm to select only objects that are at least @xmath72 old , i.e. with @xmath73 .",
    "this reduces our sample to 25 clusters whose average core radius is still @xmath74 ( marginally larger than the whole sample value ) , while the median is at @xmath75 ( marginally smaller than the whole sample analysis ) . if the @xcite @xmath76 correction is applied we have @xmath77 and median value of @xmath78 .",
    "the net effect of the correction is to reduce the mean and the median values , as by requiring @xmath79 we are biased toward selecting smaller clusters . even for this reduced sample more than half of the objects",
    "have @xmath80 , so the need for a central imbh remains strong .    as an additional test to ensure absence of observational biases ,",
    "we have further refined the reduced sample with @xmath73 to exclude globular clusters that depart from spherical symmetry , i.e. those clusters with a quoted @xmath81 , where the ellipticity ratio @xmath49 is defined in terms of the axis ratio ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "this leaves 20 objects in the sample and does not change the results : @xmath83 ( median @xmath84 ) , while @xmath85 ( median @xmath86 ) .    all the progressively selective cuts that we applied to the galactic globular cluster system provide a consistent picture where about half of the objects have a significantly large core radius , i.e. @xmath87 . if an imbh turns out to be absent in these systems , then a different dynamical explanation for their large core radii must be found .",
    "if this is indeed the case for the whole sample then a major rethinking of our knowledge of the dynamics of globular clusters is needed .",
    "nevertheless a few individual objects in the sample may turn out to have a large core radius for peculiar reasons , especially if they have been strongly perturbed and are therefore not as dynamically old as their relaxation time would imply .",
    "one example of a peculiar object that passes all our selection criteria is the cluster with the largest @xmath0 ratio , pal 13 , which is considered a very unusual object , either due a strong tidal heating during the last perigalacticon passage or due to the presence of a sizeable dark matter halo @xcite .",
    "in this paper we propose the use of the observed ratio of the core to half mass radius as a powerful indirect dynamical indicator for the presence of an imbh at the center of old stellar cluster .",
    "a number of theoretical and numerical investigations combined together @xcite strongly support the idea that after about @xmath9 to @xmath10 half - mass relaxation times the value of @xmath0 in a globular cluster assumes significantly different values depending only on whether the core contains single stars ( @xmath88 ) , a large fraction of hard binaries ( @xmath89 ) or an imbh ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the details of the initial conditions , such as the initial density profile , do not affect this quantity . by analyzing the distribution of @xmath0 in a sample of @xmath55 galactic globular clusters , selected to ensure that they are well collisionally relaxed ,",
    "we conclude that there is a strong indirect evidence for the presence of an imbh in at least half of the objects in the sample .",
    "a globular cluster that hosts an imbh represents a laboratory where dynamical interactions between hierarchical systems take place frequently , leading in particular to the formation of triples ( and even quadruples ) systems and to the ejections of a number of high velocity stars , with some able to reach ejection velocities up to several hundreds km / s ( see @xcite ) .",
    "intriguingly , some objects in the sample have a core radius that could possibly be too large ( @xmath58 ) to be explained by the presence of a _ single _ imbh .",
    "it could therefore be possible that some of these globular clusters host a binary imbh . in this case , however , the heating may be so efficient ( e.g. see @xcite for an estimate of the interaction rate of a binary bh with single stars ) that it is not clear whether the system is able to survive for even a few relaxation times .",
    "therefore an accurate numerical modeling is critically required before any conclusion about this speculation can be drawn .",
    "our conclusions on the presence of singles imbhs appear instead to be robust .",
    "we have discussed a number of possible biases in the comparison of numerical simulations with the observations , but while some of the idealizations introduced in the modeling may induce limited changes in @xmath0 , we could not identify a possible major bias .",
    "an error of the order at least @xmath90 would be required to be able to explain the observed distribution of @xmath0 without invoking the systematic presence of an imbh in half of the objects in the sample .    clearly more detailed numerical simulations will be required to evaluate and confirm the presence of imbh in specific clusters of the sample .",
    "in particular it would be extremely interesting the conversion of n - body snapshots into synthetic observations that could therefore be directly analyzed like images acquired by a telescope , avoiding an indirect comparison between theoretical and observed quantities .",
    "i am very grateful to holger baumbardt for providing the snapshots of his numerical simulations whose analysis is used in sec .",
