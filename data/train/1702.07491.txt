    "physically unclonable functions ( pufs ) exploit the static randomness resulting from uncontrollable process variations to extract instance - specific secrets . unlike assigned storage digital secrets in a memory , the instance - specific secrets arise during the creation of puf embedding devices . attributing to inevitable randomness , pufs can not be reproducibly forged even by the original manufacturer .",
    "various physical randomness sources have been utilized for building pufs such as gate - delay  @xcite , power - on state of the static random - access memory ( sram )  @xcite . among memory - based pufs ,",
    "sram pufs gained the most attention since they are considered for free  due to memory availability in almost all commodity products .",
    "as the conventional silicon technology is continuously scaling down and approaching its most material and physical extents , there is a growing urge to look for memory elements for nanoelectronic applications .",
    "the memristive device is one of promising candidates considering its faster speed , higher density , lower power and non - volatility .",
    "moreover , its fabrication is compatible with current cmos fabrication process .",
    "however , in nano region , currently , they suffer serious variations that somehow deteriorates their performance in memory applications . as the device engineers are always attempting to eliminate the variations .",
    "security applications , for example , puf constructions based on the memristive devices  @xcite , actually embrace such prevalent physical variations , because truly prevalent randomness implies more entropy when extracting puf secrets .    the response ( output ) given the same puf is highly desired to be stable when it is re - evaluated upon the same challenge ( input ) .",
    "this property is referred to as reliability . besides that , there are other desirable properties such as reconfigurability and large challenge response pairs ( crps ) space  more entropy extracted within a compact area .",
    "reconfigurability of a puf is the capability of refreshing its crps  evolving the puf itself into a new instance that exhibits different crp behaviors , which is of great importance in many application scenarios such as updating electronic tokens  electronic tickets , and preventing downgrading software versions by binding software to hardware  @xcite . as the other intermediate benefit ,",
    "the derived key from an rpuf can also be renovated whenever necessary .",
    "moreover , it is indicated that the rpuf is capable of eliminating some potential attacks such as modeling attacks and reverse engineering  @xcite .",
    "we also note that the reconfigurability helps to mitigate security concerns that malicious contract manufacturers evaluate puf secrets without authorization before puf enrollment by a trusted party . in this context , the puf secrets can be reconfigured before enrollment phase by the trust party , where the reconfigurability makes puf secrets evaluated by malicious manufactures useless . motivated by these targets , we present a memory - based puf construction , a highly * r*eliable mem*r*istive element based * r*econfigurable puf ( r@xmath0puf ) , termed as r@xmath0puf by leveraging peculiarities of memristive devices .",
    "compared with memory pufs based on cmos , eg . , sram , r@xmath0puf has higher density that enables a large crp space within a compact area attributing to the small footprint of memristive devices .",
    "most significantly , r@xmath0puf achieves both high reliability and reconfigurability , while most of current memory - based puf constructions may achieve either one of them , but not both , at the cost of expensive additional logic .",
    "the main contributions of this work are summarized as follows :    * highly reliable puf .",
    "* we develop r@xmath0puf to generate highly reliable responses . as a consequence ,",
    "error correction logic is less or even no more required resulting in a lightweight alternative that can be easily plugged into puf based key generation applications .",

    "the thickness is down to several nanometers .",
    "this enables super high content information storage capability in a compact area where memristive devices are integrated  @xcite .",
    "however , for memristive devices , resistance variations is inevitable and actually prevalent due to the hardness of fine fabrication control  @xcite .",
