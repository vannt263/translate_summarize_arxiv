    "groups and poor clusters of galaxies represent the building blocks of rich clusters and are the best laboratories for the study of their thermal and chemical history , which is governed by baryons .",
    "an important clue to the evolution of galaxies is the elemental abundances in the hot x - ray - emitting gas , e.g. , the intracluster medium ( icm ) , in groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "metals in the icm have been synthesized by supernovae ( sne ) in galaxies . as a result , the ratios of metal mass in the icm to the total light from galaxies in clusters or groups , i.e. , the metal - mass - to - light ratios , are the key parameters in investigating the chemical evolution of the icm .",
    "studies of the scaling relations in the clusters of galaxies have revealed strong deviations in the observed relations from the predictions based on self - similar collapse @xcite .",
    "the gas density profiles in the central regions of groups and poor clusters are observed to be shallower than those in the self - similar model , and the relative entropy level is correspondingly higher than that in rich clusters .",
    "these deviations are considered to be best characterized by the injection of energy ( pre - heating ) into the gas before the clusters collapse ( @xcite ) .",
    "based on rosat and asca data , @xcite showed that groups and clusters have significant excess entropy at @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite have predicted that a smoothing of the gas density due to pre - heating in infalling subhaloes would boost the entropy production at the accretion shock of clusters , and an excess of entropy is generated in the cluster outskirts .",
    "this effect due to smooth accretion should be more important for poorer systems .",
    "however , @xcite discussed that this entropy amplification effect can be reduced by cooling . recently , using xmm data , @xcite showed that at @xmath1 , the mass dependence of the entropy excess disappeared .",
    "@xcite studied the entropy profiles of groups of galaxies observed with chandra and found that the difference in the entropy excess at @xmath1 between groups and clusters is not as large as that by @xcite .",
    "the stellar and gas mass fractions within @xmath1 depend on the total system mass @xcite .",
    "these studies found that the stellar - to - total - mass ratios within @xmath1 of the groups are much larger than those in the clusters , whereas the gas mass fraction increases with the system mass .",
    "these poorer systems also differ from richer systems in that their iron - mass - to - light ratios ( imlr ) are systematically smaller than those in rich clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "the metal distribution in the icm is a tracer of the history of gas heating , because both metal enrichment and heating timescales determine the metal distribution in the icm .",
    "the chandra and xmm observations of nearby groups of galaxies with cool cores found that the fe abundances of the groups declines with the radius and metal - mass - to - light ratios of groups are much smaller than those of the clusters @xcite . on the basis of the chandra data",
    ", @xcite discussed the effect of feedback and the history of the more extended star formations in less massive systems . with xmm observations",
    ", @xcite found a difference in the abundance profiles of the cool core and non - cool core groups and discussed the effect of mixing driven by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) within the central regions .",
    "o and mg are predominantly synthesized in sn ii , whereas fe and si are synthesized in both sn ia and sn ii .",
    "therefore , abundance measurements spanning the range of species from o to fe are required for the unambiguous determination of the formation history of massive stars .",
    "xmm - newton provided a means of constraining the o and mg abundances of some systems @xcite .",
    "however , reliable results have been obtained only for the central regions of very bright clusters or groups of galaxies dominated by cd galaxies . the x - ray imaging spectrometer",
    "( xis ; @xcite ) onboard suzaku @xcite offers an improved line spread function because of its very small low - pulse - height tail in the energy range below 1  kev coupled with a very low background .",
    "therefore , especially for regions of low surface brightness or equivalent width , xis provides better sensitivity to o lines .",
    "the instrumental al line of the mos detectors on xmm - newton causes problems in measuring the mg abundance in somewhat fainter systems .",
    "the oxygen - mass - to - light ratios ( omlrs ) as well as the imlrs of several clusters of galaxies and several groups of galaxies out to 0.20.3   @xmath0 were measured with suzaku satellite @xcite .",
    "the difference in the omlrs between groups and clusters is a factor of about 36 , and tends to be larger than the imlr difference , which is a factor of 23 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fornax cluster is a nearby poor cluster with an icm temperature of 1.31.5kev ( @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray emission shows an asymmetric spatial distribution , and the cd galaxy , ngc 1399 , is offset from the center @xcite , which may be related to large - scale dynamical evolution such as infall motions of galaxies into the cluster ( @xcite ) .",
    "the chandra observations suggest that relative motion may occur between ngc 1399 and the icm , and that the second brightest elliptical galaxy , ngc 1404 , is moving supersonically in the icm ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the fe and si abundances of the icm within @xmath2 of ngc 1399 were measured with xmm - newton ( buote 2002 ) .",
    "the omlr and imlr within 0.13 @xmath0 derived from early suzaku observations of two fields of the fornax cluster ( @xcite ) are the smallest among those in the groups of galaxies observed with suzaku .    in this paper",
    ", we describe our study of the icm of the fornax cluster for regions within 0.0350.2 @xmath0 observed with suzaku and the temperature and fe abundance out to 0.3 @xmath0 observed with xmm - newton . in section 2 ,",
    "we summarize the observations and data preparation .",
    "section 3 describes our analysis of the data , and in section 4 , the temperature and the o , mg , si , s , and fe abundances are determined .",
    "we discuss our results in section 5 .",
    "we use the hubble constant @xmath3 .",
    "the distance to the fornax cluster is @xmath4  mpc and @xmath5 corresponds to 5.70  kpc . the virial radius , @xmath6  mpc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , is about 1  mpc for the average temperature @xmath7  kev . in this paper",

    "<S> suzaku observed a central region and five offset regions within 0.2 @xmath0 in the fornax cluster , a nearby poor cluster , and xmm - newton mapped the cluster with 15 pointings out to 0.3 @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the distributions of o , mg , si , s , and fe in the intracluster medium ( icm ) were studied with suzaku , and those of fe and temperature were studied with xmm . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of the icm gradually decreases with radius from 1.3 kev at 0.04 @xmath0 to 1 kev at 0.20.3 @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> if the new solar abundances of @xcite and a single - temperature plasma model are adopted , o , mg , si , s , and fe show similar abundances : 0.40.6 solar within 0.020.2 @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this fe abundance is similar to those at 0.10.2 @xmath0 in rich clusters and other groups of galaxies . at 0.20.3 @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> the fe abundance becomes 0.20.3 solar . </S>",
    "<S> a two - temperature plasma model yields icm abundances that are higher by a factor of 1.21.5 , but gives similar abundance ratios among o , mg , si , s , and fe . the northern region has a lower icm temperature and higher brightness and fe abundance , whereas the southern region has a higher icm temperature and lower brightness and fe abundance . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that the cd galaxy may have traveled from the north because of recent dynamical evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the cumulative oxygen- and iron - mass - to - light ratios ( omlr and imlr ) within 0.3 @xmath0 are more than an order of magnitude lower than those of rich clusters and some relaxed groups of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> past dynamical evolution might have hindered the strong concentration of hot gas in the fornax cluster s central region . </S>",
    "<S> scatter in the imlr and similarity in the element abundances in the icm of groups and clusters of galaxies indicate early metal synthesis . </S>"
