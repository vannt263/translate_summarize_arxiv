    "the radioisotope @xmath0al is of outstanding importance for @xmath2-ray astronomy and cosmochemistry .",
    "it has been discovered in three distinct sites : ( i ) in the galactic interstellar medium via detection of its decay emission line at 1809 kev ( mahoney et al .",
    "1982 , diehl et al . 1995 ) ; ( ii ) in meteorites via observed excesses of its radioactive decay ( daughter ) product @xmath0 mg ( macpherson , davies & zinner 1995 ) , implying an injection of live @xmath0al into the early solar system nebula ; and ( iii ) in presolar dust grains , again via detected @xmath0 mg excesses ( hoppe et al . 1994",
    "; huss , hutcheon & wasserburg 1997 ) , that are uncontaminated by solar system material and thus are of likely stellar origin .",
    "identification of the main sources of @xmath0al would have far - reaching implications , ranging from questions related to the circumstances and conditions of the solar system birth to imposing strong constraints on the chemical evolution of the galaxy . a number of different sources",
    "have been suggested over the years : agb stars , classical novae , wolf - rayet stars , and core collapse supernovae . for reviews ,",
    "see prantzos & diehl ( 1996 ) or diehl & timmes ( 1998 ) .",
    "however , the origin of @xmath0al remains controversial .",
    "the observation of galactic @xmath2-rays from @xmath0al is important since it provides unambiguous _ direct _ evidence for the theory of nucleosynthesis in stars . the half - life of @xmath0al amounts to @xmath11 y and is small compared to the time scale of galactic chemical evolution ( @xmath1210@xmath13 y ) .",
    "consequently , nucleosynthesis is currently occurring in the interstellar medium and , in particular , @xmath0al is synthesized throughout the galaxy . from the observed @xmath2-ray intensity , depending on the assumption for the density distribution , a present - day @xmath0al equilibrium mass of @xmath14  @xmath15 in the entire galaxy has been inferred ( diehl et al .",
    "the observational evidence favors in this case massive stars as a source : first , the all - sky map of the 1809 kev @xmath2-ray line detected by the comptel instrument onboard cgro showed that @xmath0al is confined along the galactic disk and that the measured intensity is clumpy and asymmetric ( plschke et al .",
    "2001 ) ; second , the comparison between the @xmath0al all - sky map from comptel to other all - sky maps for different wavelengths ( kndlseder 1999 ) revealed that the 1.8 mev @xmath2-ray emission is correlated with the galactic free - free emission , which traces the distribution of ionized gas in the interstellar medium , observed in the microwave domain by the cobe satellite ; third , the measurement of the 1809 kev line doppler shift by the spi spectrometer onboard integral demonstrated that @xmath0al co - rotates with the galaxy and hence supports a galaxy - wide origin ( diehl et al .",
    "2006 ) . here",
    "we investigate the bulk production of @xmath0al in massive stars .",
    "a study of @xmath0al/@xmath10al ratios observed in meteorites and presolar grains will be subject of a separate study .",
    "massive stars may produce @xmath0al during several different phases of their evolution : ( i ) during pre - supernova stages in the c / ne convective shell , where a fraction of the @xmath0al survives the subsequent explosion and is ejected into the interstellar medium ( arnett & wefel 1978 ) ; ( ii ) during core collapse via explosive ne / c burning ( arnett 1977 ) , where the ejected @xmath0al yield may perhaps be modified by the @xmath16-process via neutrino spallation ( woosley et al . 1990 ) ; and ( iii ) in wolf - rayet stars , i.e. , stars with masses in excess of about @xmath17 , which experience such a strong mass loss that even layers located within the h convective core , hence significantly enriched in @xmath0al , are ejected into the interstellar medium ( palacios et al . 2005 ) .",
    "these @xmath0al production mechanisms ( with the exception of the @xmath16-process ) were recently analyzed in detail by limongi & chieffi ( 2006 ) by using extensive stellar model calculations of solar metallicity stars in the mass range of @xmath18 . in that work",
    "they also emphasized the impact of rate uncertainties for selected reactions on the final @xmath0al yields .",
    "another discussion along these lines can be found in woosley & heger ( 2007 ) .    in the present work",
    "we expand this effort by presenting a comprehensive investigation of the impact of nuclear reaction rate uncertainties on the synthesis of @xmath0al .",
    "our method is similar in spirit to earlier nuclear reaction rate sensitivity studies that addressed the nucleosynthesis in classical novae ( iliadis et al .",
    "2002 ) and type i x - ray bursts ( parikh et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the general strategy consists of varying the rates of many reactions by different factors ( in this work , 10 , 2 , 0.5 and 0.1 ) and to analyze the impact of each individual reaction rate change on the final @xmath0al yields .",
    "once the yield changes are established for this grid of rate variation factors , more realistic abundance changes based on actual rate uncertainties , if available , are considered . at present it is not feasible to perform this computationally intensive procedure with a self - consistent stellar model .",
    "instead , we extract representative temperature - density - time profiles from recent stellar evolution models of massive stars and execute a large number of post - processing reaction network sensitivity calculations using these profiles . our goal is two - fold . on the one hand",
    ", we would like to quantify to what degree predictions of @xmath0al yields depend on currently uncertain nuclear physics input .",
    "on the other hand , by identifying the  most important nuclear reactions \" , our results represent a guide for future measurements .",
    "there are a number of novel aspects about the present work .",
    "first , we employ a new - generation library of nuclear reaction and weak interaction rates , called starlib .",
    "this library is partially based on a recent evaluation of experimental monte carlo reaction rates ( iliadis et al .",
    "besides recommended reaction rates for a grid of temperature values between 1 mk and 10 gk , the library includes in addition for many reactions the rate uncertainty factor at each temperature .",
    "in fact , this work represents the first application of starlib .",
    "second , we carefully investigate the equilibration effects of @xmath0al .",
    "at least two species of @xmath0al take part in the nucleosynthesis , the ground state and the isomeric state . in all previous investigations , either a single species or two species of @xmath0al",
    "were taken into account , depending on whether thermal equilibrium is achieved or not . obviously , these are two extreme assumptions and in a hot stellar plasma the ground and isomeric state may  communicate \" via @xmath2-ray transitions involving higher - lying @xmath0al levels .",
    "our study has some obvious limitations .",
    "first , since we perform post - processing calculations , we necessarily focus our investigation on the effects of nuclear reaction rates . in other words , the important effects of convection ,",
    "is replaced by its mass - weighted average over the convective region , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "hence it is perfectly plausible to use a single point evolution for a convective region if the turnover time is faster that the nuclear burning time ( e.g. , for core h burning ) .",
    "furthermore , we performed the calculation using un - weighted rates instead of mass - weighted average rates because we are mostly interested in @xmath0al abundance _",
    "changes_. ] , mass loss , rotation , and so on , are outside the scope of the present work .",
    "this also implies that our simulations are unsuitable for defining _ absolute _",
    "@xmath0al yields .",
    "instead , we claim that our procedure is useful for exploring the effects of @xmath0al abundance _ changes _ that result from reaction rate variations .",
    "second , we only explore a few temperature - density - time evolutions that are representative of solar metallicity stars . a more comprehensive study covering a broad range of stellar masses and metallicities",
    "is also beyond the scope of this work .",
    "third , it is well - known that the radioisotope @xmath20fe ( half - life of @xmath21 y ) is likely co - produced with @xmath0al in massive stars and that their abundance ratio provides a sensitive constraint on stellar models ( see limongi & chieffi 2006 ; woosley & heger 2007 ; and references therein ) . indeed , galactic @xmath2-rays from the decay of @xmath20fe have been detected by both rhessi and the spi spectrometer onboard integral , and the observed @xmath2-ray line flux ratio for @xmath20fe and @xmath0al amounts to @xmath22 ( harris et al . 2005 ) . in the present work we only focus on the nucleosynthesis of @xmath0al and",
    "leave a similar sensitivity study for @xmath20fe to future work and @xmath8c(@xmath4,@xmath2)@xmath23o rate variations on the @xmath0al , @xmath24ti and @xmath20fe yields were investigated using stellar evolution and explosion models .",
    "the authors claimed that  ... over a range of twice the experimental uncertainty , @xmath25 , for each helium - burning rate , the production of @xmath0al , @xmath20fe , and their ratio vary by factors of 5 or more ... \" . by looking in detail at their results ,",
    "it is clear that the effects on the @xmath20fe yield are indeed large .",
    "however , it becomes also apparent that the effects on the @xmath0al yield are much smaller .",
    "for example , their 25@xmath15 model and adopting the initial abundances from lodders ( 2003 ) provides a factor of 1.5 change in @xmath0al yield if the triple-@xmath4 and @xmath8c(@xmath4,@xmath2)@xmath23o rates are individually varied by their 1@xmath25 experimental uncertainties ( see their tab .",
    "3 ) . as will be seen , the rate uncertainty effects explored in the present work result in significantly larger @xmath0al yield variations . ] . finally , by individually varying each rate and leaving all other rates at their nominal values , we disregard any correlations among different reactions . in our opinion , no single study will cover all of the possible uncertainties , but each approach has advantages and disadvantages .",
    "we present only one realization of a sensitivity study , similar to the procedure applied in iliadis et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and parikh et al . (",
    "interestingly , the latter work explored two methods : the one applied here and also a monte carlo procedure .",
    "it was found by parikh et al .",
    "( 2008 ) that very similar results were obtained with  ... minor differences attributed to such correlation effects ... \" .",
    "we feel that a monte carlo procedure makes most sense if it is performed with _",
    "reliable _ experimentally based reaction rate probability densities .",
    "however , as will become apparent below , we do not have this information for all of the important reaction rates yet and thus leave such a study to future work when an update of starlib becomes available .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "our procedure is explained in more detail in @xmath26 2 , including a discussion of stellar models , the equilibration of @xmath0al , and a description of the library starlib .",
    "the results of reaction rate sensitivity studies are presented in @xmath26 3 for the three predicted main sites of @xmath0al synthesis : explosive ne / c burning , convective c / ne shell burning , and convective h core burning .",
    "a summary and conclusions are given in @xmath26 4 .",
    "more information on reaction and decay rates , together with a discussion of individual reactions , is provided in the appendix .",
    "the stellar models adopted in the present work are those presented in limongi & chieffi ( 2006 ) . for the sake of completeness , we summarize the basic properties of these models and the main results concerning the production of @xmath0al in massive stars .",
    "the evolution of each stellar model was computed from the pre - main sequence phase up to the onset of the iron core collapse by using the stellar evolutionary code franec ( frascati raphson newton evolutionary code , release 5.050218 ) .",
    "the kernel of this code has been presented in limongi & chieffi ( 2003 ) ( and references therein ) . here",
    "we will only mention recent updates .",
    "first , the convective mixing and the nuclear burning were coupled together providing a set of diffusion equations that are linearized and solved simultaneously by means of a newton - raphson method .",
    "this coupling is extremely important in all situations where the nuclear burning timescale of a given nuclide is comparable to the mixing turnover time .",
    "thus the interaction between the local nuclear burning and the convective mixing can not be disregarded .",
    "the nuclear network adopted was the same as in limongi & chieffi ( 2003 ) and the thermonuclear reaction rates were up - to - date at the time when these models were computed ( see tab . 1 of limongi & chieffi 2006 ) .",
    "the nuclide @xmath0al was treated in a distinct manner , by assuming two separate species ( for the ground and isomeric state ) for temperatures below @xmath27  gk , and a single ( thermalized ) species above this temperature .",
    "mass loss was included following the prescriptions of vink et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for the blue supergiant phase ( @xmath28  k ) , de jager et al .",
    "( 1988 ) for the red supergiant phase ( @xmath29  k ) , and nugis & lamers ( 2000 ) for the wolf - rayet phase .",
    "all of these solar metallicity models had an initial he mass fraction of 0.285 and a global metallicity ( by mass ) of @xmath30 .",
    "the relative abundances for the various nuclear species were adopted from anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "the explosion of the mantle of the star was started artificially , by instantaneously imparting an initial velocity of @xmath31 to a mass coordinate corresponding to @xmath32 of the presupernova model .",
    "such a mass coordinate relates to a region located well within the iron core and is chosen in such a way that the initial conditions should not affect the properties of the shock wave too much at a time when it approaches the fe - si interface .",
    "the formation and propagation of the shock wave , generated in such a way , was calculated by means of a computer code that solves the fully compressible reactive hydrodynamic equations by applying the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) of colella & woodward ( 1984 ) , using a lagrangian scheme .",
    "the chemical evolution of the matter was computed by coupling the same nuclear reaction network that was adopted in the hydrostatic calculations to the system of hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the free parameter @xmath31 was properly adjusted in order to obtain a given final kinetic energy of the ejecta or , equivalently , to eject a given amount of mass above the fe core .",
    "since @xmath0al was synthesized in regions relatively far away from the fe core ( see below ) , its final yield did not depend on the particular choice of @xmath31 provided that at least a minimum amount of @xmath33ni was ejected .    based on this set of presupernova models and simulated explosions ,",
    "it was found that @xmath0al is produced in massive stars in three distinct evolutionary stages : core h burning , c convective shell burning just prior to the core collapse , and explosive ne / c burning .",
    "any @xmath0al produced by these massive stars is ejected into the interstellar medium , both by stellar winds and the explosion , in different proportions depending on the initial stellar mass .",
    "it was also found that @xmath0al was mainly produced by explosive ne / c burning over most of the initial mass interval between 11 and 120   @xmath34 . only for the more massive stars ,",
    "say , @xmath35 , did the wind component ( produced during core h burning ) become important ( see tab . 3 and fig . 2 in limongi & chieffi 2006 for details )",
    "in the present work , we based our study on 20 , 60 and 80 @xmath15 model stars for exploring @xmath0al yield sensitivities in explosive ne / c burning , c convective shell burning and core h burning , respectively .",
    "these choices of model stars are motivated by the fact that they provide relatively large @xmath0al yields .",
    "the nuclear physics input for the present post - processing studies is based on a new - generation library , called starlib .",
    "it originated from a previous version of reaclib ( originally created by f .-",
    "k . thielemann ) that one of us modified over the years and was used for all of the reaction network calculations presented in iliadis 2007 .    at that point in time",
    "several important changes occurred . a recent evaluation of reaction rates for the a=14 - 40 target range ( iliadis et al .",
    "2010 ) was completed .",
    "these 62 _ experimental _ rates are based on a monte carlo technique , allowing for a rigorous definition of recommended reaction rates and their associated uncertainties .",
    "the monte carlo procedure also provides , for the first time , for any given temperature the ( output ) reaction rate probability density function that is based on the ( input ) probability densities of measured nuclear physics quantities ( such as s - factors , resonance energies , resonance strengths , upper limits in spectroscopic factors , etc . ) . from the cumulative distributions of the rate probability densities , a low rate ,",
    "median rate and high rate can be defined as the 0.16 , 0.50 and 0.84 quantiles , respectively , assuming a coverage probability of 68% .",
    "the meaning of these rates is in general different from the commonly reported , but statistically meaningless , literature expressions  lower limit \" ,  nominal value \" and  upper limit \" of the total reaction rate .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the monte carlo rates incorporate both statistical _ and _ systematic uncertainties , as explained in detail in longland et al .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown in longland et al .",
    "( 2010 ) that in the majority of cases the monte carlo rate probability density function can be approximated by a lognormal distribution , which is determined by only two parameters : the lognormal location parameter @xmath36 and the lognormal spread parameter @xmath25 .",
    "the former parameter determines the recommended reaction rate via @xmath37 , while the latter parameter corresponds to the rate factor uncertainty via @xmath38 .",
    "the information on the rate probability density was not available previously and opens interesting windows of opportunity for monte carlo studies of nucleosynthesis and energy generation in stars .",
    "however , it becomes clear from the above discussion that three quantities ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 , lognormal @xmath25 ) instead of the traditional two ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) need to be reported so that the user can calculate the rate probability density for each reaction at each temperature .",
    "therefore , it was decided to convert our 2007 version of the reaclib , which lists the recommended reaction rates as analytical functions of temperature by employing a number of rate fitting parameters , to a tabular format . to be precise , the rate tables are directly derived from the fitting parameters and not from any tabular rates given in the original publications .",
    "the new format consists of three columns and lists for each reaction the temperature , the recommended rate and the rate factor uncertainty on a grid of 60 temperatures between 1 mk and 10 gk , allowing for an accurate interpolation between grid points . at this stage the rate factor uncertainty for each reaction",
    "is set equal to a nominal value of 10 . in a subsequent step ,",
    "the rates and factor uncertainties of 62 reactions in the a=14 - 40 region were replaced with their exact monte carlo results .",
    "in addition , the rates of the following interactions were replaced with more recent information , where @xmath41 denotes a reaction rate ; this expression can be employed to derive approximate rate factor uncertainties , @xmath42 , from published high and low reaction rate boundaries .",
    "furthermore , all of the replaced rates are obtained from the exact rate tables of the original publications , not from any fitting parameters . ] : ( i ) 10 big bang reactions , using the rates of descouvemont et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , which were derived from an r - matrix description of the available data ; ( ii ) 30 reactions from the nacre evaluation of experimental rates ( angulo et al . 1999 ) , in the mass range of a=1 - 26 ; ( iii ) ( n,@xmath2 ) reactions based on the kadonis v0.2 evaluation of experimental rates ( dillmann et al .",
    "2006 ) ; ( iv ) a number of special reactions , such as @xmath43n(p,@xmath2)@xmath44o ( bertone et al .",
    ", in preparation ) and @xmath8c(@xmath4,@xmath2)@xmath23o ( kunz et al .",
    "2002 ) ; ( v ) 550 experimental rates for @xmath45-decays and @xmath45-delayed particle decays including associated uncertainties , calculated from the half lives and branching ratios compiled in audi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ; and ( vi ) 17 @xmath2-ray transitions rates for @xmath0al ( see below ) .",
    "for all nuclear reactions mentioned above , the corresponding reverse reaction rates were also calculated and properly accounted for in the library .",
    "furthermore , all experimental reaction rates were corrected for the effects of thermal target excitations using the stellar enhancement factors and partition functions of rauscher & thielemann ( 2000 ) , although it should be noted that these effects are relatively small for the sites of nucleosynthesis discussed here . for all other reactions for which insufficient experimental information is available to compute reliable experimental rates , the results of statistical model calculations ( rauscher & thielemann 2000 ) were adopted .",
    "the new library , starlib , described above extends in its present version up to antimony ( sb ) and is employed for the very first time in the present work .",
    "a more detailed account of starlib will be published elsewhere ( iliadis et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we emphasize that the rate probability density functions contained in starlib are not directly used in the present post - processing calculations .",
    "however , the tabulated rate factor uncertainties will be useful in later sections for the discussion of reaction rate uncertainties .",

    "the subsequent decay to the @xmath0 mg ground state gives rise to the 1809 kev @xmath2-ray line emission observed in the galactic plane ( @xmath26 [ intro ] ) .",

    "the possible communication of the @xmath0al ground state and isomeric state ( 228 kev ) via thermal excitations involving higher - lying levels ( 417 , 1058 and 2070 kev ) is apparent .",

    "the @xmath45-decays shown do not necessarily represent direct transitions , but rather indicate if the ground state or first excited state ( at 1809 kev ) in @xmath0 mg is predominantly populated by a given transition.[figlevel ] ]    although the direct @xmath2-ray transition between @xmath0al@xmath47 and @xmath0al@xmath49 is strongly inhibited , they may nevertheless be linked ( or  communicate \" ) with each other via thermal excitations involving higher - lying @xmath0al levels .",

    "it is obvious that at sufficiently high temperatures and long timescales @xmath0al@xmath47 and @xmath0al@xmath49 will achieve thermal equilibrium , implying that their abundance ratio is simply determined by the boltzmann distribution ( i.e. , by plasma temperature and energy difference ) , and that the internal equilibration mechanism is not important . however , it is also clear that , by lowering temperature and time scale , the ground and isomeric state will fall out of thermal equilibrium at some point .",
    "the important issue to consider for a reaction network calculation is if and when @xmath0al should be treated as a single species ( @xmath0al@xmath57 , denoting thermal equilibrium ) or as two distinct species ( @xmath0al@xmath47 and @xmath0al@xmath49 ) that @xmath45-decay with their characteristic laboratory half lives .",
    "this issue was investigated by ward & fowler ( 1980 ) , who established the generally accepted procedure : above a limiting temperature value of t=0.4 gk , the nuclide @xmath0al should be regarded as a single species ( with all of its levels in thermal equilibrium ) , while below this temperature two distinct species ( no equilibrium ) should be assumed .",
    "some of the important @xmath2-ray transition rates in @xmath0al have not been measured yet ( indicated by the thin vertical arrows in fig . [ figlevel ] ) and ward & fowler ( 1980 ) had to employ for these rather crude approximations .",
    "in more recent work ( coc , porquet & nowacki 1999 ; runkle , champagne & engel 2001 ) the @xmath2-ray transition rates have been estimated by using shell model calculations and the thermal equilibration of @xmath0al was studied in more detail using small reaction networks .",
    "these works confirmed the assumption that above @xmath58 gk the ground and isomeric state are in thermal equilibrium , while below @xmath59 gk these two states @xmath45-decay with their laboratory half lives ( i.e. , neither equilibrium nor any communication between levels ) . in the transitional temperature region , @xmath60 gk , the effective @xmath0al decay rate was found to deviate substantially from the results reported by ward & fowler ( 1980 ) by up to 4 orders - of - magnitude and , furthermore , that @xmath0al@xmath47 and @xmath0al@xmath49 are indirectly linked by @xmath2-ray transitions ( i.e. , they achieve a quasi - equilibrium ) .",
    "it was pointed out by runkle , champagne & engel ( 2001 ) that these findings rest on simplifying assumptions and may not hold if the nuclear reactions that produce or destroy @xmath0al are sufficiently fast to disturb the thermal equilibration .",
    "see also , gupta & meyer ( 2001 ) .    in the present work",
    "we examine carefully the equilibration of @xmath0al for each of the three nucleosynthesis sites mentioned above .",
    "two separate post - processing calculations using recommended interaction rates are performed and the resulting @xmath0al yields are compared : one assuming either a single or two separate @xmath0al species , depending on the temperature regime ( according to ward & fowler 1980 ) , and one where the communication between ground and isomeric states is explicitly taken into account . for the latter case , no artificial assumptions about the equilibration of @xmath0al are made , but additional @xmath0al species ( i.e. , levels at 417 , 1058 and 2070 kev ; see fig .",
    "[ figlevel ] ) need to be taken into account in the reaction network .",
    "the @xmath2-ray transition rates linking the various levels in @xmath0al , and the most important @xmath45-decay transition rates to @xmath0 mg , are adopted from runkle , champagne & engel ( 2001 ) .",
    "since these have not been published elsewhere , we list the decay constants versus temperature in appendix [ appdec ] .",
    "furthermore , when taking more than two @xmath0al species into account , the reaction rates for @xmath0al@xmath61 and @xmath0al@xmath49 are separately needed .",
    "this represents an additional complication since , as will be seen below , some of these rates are poorly known at present .",
    "when performing the two separate post - processing calculations referred to above , it is of utmost importance that an _ internally consistent _ set of rates for the production and destruction of @xmath0al@xmath57 , @xmath0al@xmath47 and @xmath0al@xmath9 is employed .",
    "suppose , for example , that the rate of a destruction reaction @xmath0al@xmath62(a , b ) in the first calculation ( i.e. , assuming a single @xmath0al species ) is adopted from one specific source , and the rates of the physically related reactions @xmath0al@xmath47(a , b ) and @xmath0al@xmath49(a , b ) in the second calculation ( i.e. , assuming five different @xmath0al species ) are adopted from a different source . in such a case , when comparing the results of the two network calculations , one may find significant differences in @xmath0al yields .",
    "however , these may not be caused at all by the effects of thermal equilibration of @xmath0al but may rather reflect spurious results caused by using inconsistent reaction rates . in order to elucidate this issue , we list in appendix [ appreac ] the rates and sources of all reactions considered in our network that produce and destroy @xmath0al .",
    "the same reaction network is used in the present work for investigating the nucleosynthesis of @xmath0al in the predicted main locations of massive stars : explosive ne / c burning , convective shell c / ne burning and convective core h burning .",

    ". we started by considering the net abundance flows ( i.e , the difference of total abundance flows between a given forward and corresponding reverse reaction ) , integrated over the entire duration of a  standard \" post - processing calculation .",
    "these flows will be displayed graphically below for each of the three burning regimes .",
    "all rates of reactions with net flows within 3 orders - of - magnitude of the maximum flow were then selected for the variation procedure . obviously , the forward and corresponding reverse reaction rate need to be multiplied by the same variation factor .",
    "we added to this list all reactions that either destroy or produce @xmath0al , @xmath10al and @xmath3 mg , if these were not taken into account already .",
    "furthermore , a number of selected other reactions , for example , @xmath8c(@xmath8c , n)@xmath7 mg and @xmath6mg(p,@xmath2)@xmath3al , were added to the list .",
    "we find it unlikely that any other reaction not identified by the above procedure has a major impact on @xmath0al nucleosynthesis in massive stars .",
    "a number of important issues need to be considered in detail when performing any reaction rate sensitivity study using post - processing calculations .",
    "first , it is assumed that the nuclear reaction rates to be varied do not impact the nuclear energy generation .",
    "if a given reaction rate variation changes both the energy generation and the final @xmath0al abundance , then this result has no obvious meaning .",
    "clearly , in such cases the rate should be varied using the full , self - consistent stellar model .",
    "for example , changing the rate of the @xmath71ne(@xmath2,@xmath4)@xmath23o reaction , the process that initiates ne burning , influences the @xmath0al abundance , although the effect is small , as will be seen below . throughout this work",
    ", we carefully checked that a rate variation did not impact at the same time the energy generation .",
    "second , it is very important to verify that a given temperature - density - time evolution is followed _",
    "precisely _ in a post - processing calculation .",
    "the time step is numerically adjusted to track the abundance evolutions above some limiting abundance value .",
    "for example , spurious abundance variations may occur if a time step misses the peak temperature even by a few percent .",
    "therefore , we carefully checked that the temperature - density evolution is followed closely ( within a fraction of a percent ) .",
    "finally , we need to address the issue of stellar versus laboratory @xmath45-decay rates .",
    "the stellar plasma affects @xmath45-decays in a number of ways .",
    "first , at high temperatures thermally excited states in the @xmath45-decaying nuclide may undergo transitions to levels in the daughter nuclide .",
    "second , at high ( electron ) densities the decay constants for electron ( or positron ) capture will increase .",
    "both effects generally cause a change in the total @xmath45-decay rate .",
    "many previous stellar model studies employed the stellar @xmath45-decay constants calculated by fuller , fowler & newman ( 1982 ) for the mass range of a=21 - 60 , or the more modern results of oda et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , that are based on shell model calculations , for the mass range of a=17 - 39 . for the purposes of the present work ,",
    "the highest temperature and density values are encountered in explosive ne / c burning , with peak values of @xmath85 gk and @xmath86 g / cm@xmath66 ( see below ) . by inspecting the tables of oda et al .",
    "( 1994 ) in the region a@xmath8830 , we find that for the temperatures and densities of interest here the stellar and laboratory @xmath45-decay rates are very similar in magnitude .",
    "the only exceptions are the @xmath45-decays of the long - lived species @xmath73na and @xmath6na .",
    "however , their destruction via the processes ( @xmath2,n ) , ( @xmath2,p ) or ( p,@xmath2 ) is much faster compared to the @xmath45-decays and , therefore , their stellar @xmath45-decay rate is unimportant at high values of @xmath39 and @xmath89 . in conclusion , it is sufficient to adopt laboratory @xmath45-decay rates throughout this work , except for the @xmath45-decay of ( thermalized ) @xmath0al@xmath57 . for the calculation of this decay",

    "there are a number of reasons that warrant a re - measurement of this reaction .",
    "most importantly , the strengths have been determined relative to an absolute strength measurement for the e@xmath172 kev resonance , assuming that the stoichiometry of their nacl target amounts to 1:1 .",

    "( 2002 ) in connection with the @xmath7na(p,@xmath4)@xmath71ne reaction , where it was shown that during proton bombardment a nacl target quickly changes its stoichiometry to 5:3 , resulting in a significant change in thick - target yield ( and in the derived resonance strength ) .",
    "this problem is certainly aggravated when using an @xmath4-particle beam incident on a nacl target .",
    "there were other problems in the analysis of whitmire & davids ( 1974 ) : ( i ) protons populating higher - lying final states could only be resolved at the highest measured energies ; ( ii ) the uncertainty in the resonance energies is relatively large , amounting to @xmath1210 kev ; ( iii ) the assumed uncertainties of 1% for the stopping cross sections of @xmath4-particles in na and cl seem unreasonably small .",
