    "the concept of correlation , i.e. , information of one system about another , is a key element in many - body physics .",
    "indeed , the properties of a many - body system are strongly affected by changes in the correlations among its constituents .",
    "these changes are responsible for the occurrence of remarkable phenomena such as a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) , which is a critical change in the ground state of a quantum system due to level crossings in its energy spectrum .",
    "qpts occur at low temperatures @xmath1 where the de broglie wavelength is greater than the correlation length of the thermal fluctuations ( effectively @xmath2 )  @xcite .",
    "striking examples of qpts include metal - insulator transitions in strongly correlated electronic materials , magnetic transitions in quantum spin lattices , superfluid - mott insulator transitions in atomic gases induced by a bose - einstein condensation , among others .",
    "correlations can be both from classical and quantum sources .",
    "the existence of genuinely quantum correlations can be usually inferred by the presence of entanglement among parts of a system .",
    "indeed , entanglement displays a rather interesting behavior at qpts  @xcite , being able to indicate a quantum critical point ( qcp ) through nonanalyticities inherited from the ground state energy  @xcite .",
    "moreover , for one - dimensional critical systems , ground state entanglement entropy exhibits a universal logarithmic scaling governed by the central charge of the virasoro algebra associated with the underlying conformal field theory  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the logarithmic scaling is robust against disorder  @xcite . in higher dimensions , entanglement usually scales following an area law for noncritical systems ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for critical models ,",
    "violations of the area law have been found  @xcite , with logarithmic - type corrections appearing .",
    "more recently , it has been observed that an area law is generally implied by a finite correlation length when measured in terms of the mutual information  @xcite .",
    "this remarkable behavior of entanglement at criticality is indeed a consequence of the correlation pattern exhibited by the ground state of the system .",
    "nevertheless , although entanglement provides a route to find out the existence of quantum correlations , it can be shown that they can appear even when entanglement is absent  @xcite .",
    "quantum correlations , which can be measured by the _ quantum discord _",
    "@xcite , often arise as a consequence of coherence in a quantum system , being present even for separable states .",
    "moreover , entangled states commonly involve more than only quantum correlations , i.e. , they usually carry classical correlations among their parts . in a multiparty mixed - state scenario ,",
    "the possibility of nonseparable states with purely quantum correlations ( with no supporting background of classical correlations ) have also been investigated  @xcite , but genuine indicators of multiparticle classical correlations are still under debate  @xcite . by focusing on condensed - matter systems ,",
    "the aim of this work is , starting from an arbitrary @xmath0-symmetric model , to investigate pairwise correlations , explicitly splitting up their classical and quantum contributions and analyzing their behavior at qpts . as an illustration",
    ", ground states of both xxz and transverse field ising spin chains will be shown to share quantum as well as classical correlations for nearest - neighbor spin pairs , with both of them signalling the critical behavior of the system .",
    "an analysis of such correlations for the thermodynamic limit of xxz and ising chains has recently appeared in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we generalize this analysis by providing analytical expressions for the correlations in each model and also by discussing their finite - size behavior . as a further illustration",

    "<S> we analytically derive these correlations for general real density matrices displaying @xmath0 symmetry . as an illustration </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze both the xxz and the transverse field ising models . </S>",
    "<S> finite - size as well as infinite chains are investigated and the quantum criticality is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we identify the spin functions that govern the correlations . as a further example , we also consider correlations in the hartree - fock ground state of the lipkin - meshkov - glick model . </S>",
    "<S> it is then shown that both classical correlation and quantum discord exhibit signatures of the quantum phase transitions . </S>"
