    "recent proposals to realize topological superconductivity in chains of magnetic impurities have renewed the interest towards these systems.@xcite the attractive features of topological superconductivity in shiba chains arise from the fact that , in principle , these systems can be realized by garden variety materials ; majorana end states can be directly imaged by stm , and shiba chains can be made atomically perfect .",

    "( [ app : topophase ] ) gives us @xmath143 or @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the diagonal pauli - matrix .",
    "the upper equation is nothing but the non - linear two - band model , while the right equation gives us the new four - band phase diagram .",
    "rewriting both of the equations leads us to @xmath146 from which it is evident that the two equations are approximately equal when @xmath147 or equivalently @xmath148 where @xmath149 and @xmath150 are the same as @xmath114 and @xmath115 defined in the article , except for a sign change on the trigonometric terms if @xmath136 .",
    "the above inequality is necessarily satisfied when @xmath151 , as both @xmath149 and @xmath150 are bounded for all finite @xmath87 .",
    "it is important to note that the left - hand equation in  ( [ app : topodet ] ) is the non - linear two - band model and does not correspond to a real root of the original determinant .",
    "this is because our approach becomes invalid , since right - hand equation becomes undefined because of the non - invertibility of our @xmath152 matrix . as a result of this",
    ", we see that the four - band model approaches the two - band model when @xmath20 grows and given that the non - linear two - band model reduces to the linear model when @xmath153 we can conclude that our model reduces to the linear two - band model in the deep - dilute limit .",
    "beginning with eq .  ( [ shibaana ] ) , we take the determinant of the complete matrix and require that it be zero .",
    "while this is at first glance a polynomial equation of degree 8 , straightforward manipulation of terms will reduce it to an equation of the form @xmath154 , where all the parameters are functions of @xmath24 . because of the simple form of this fourth - degree polynomial equation , the solutions are reasonably short : @xmath155 where @xmath156 , @xmath157 .",
    "this assumes @xmath158 , which is the case for all parameters used in this article .",
    "the terms in the quartic equation defined above are found to be    @xmath159\\\\   b = & \\alpha^3\\left[(1+h_k^{\\uparrow\\uparrow})(d_{-k}^{\\uparrow\\uparrow})^2-(1+h_{-k}^{\\uparrow\\uparrow})(d_k^{\\uparrow\\uparrow})^2 + 2d_{k}^{\\uparrow\\downarrow}h_{k}^{\\uparrow\\downarrow}(d_k^{\\uparrow\\uparrow}-d_{-k}^{\\uparrow\\uparrow})\\right]\\\\ & + \\alpha^3(h_{-k}^{\\uparrow\\uparrow}-h_k^{\\uparrow\\uparrow})\\left[(1+h_k^{\\uparrow\\uparrow})(1+h_{-k}^{\\uparrow\\uparrow})+(d_{k}^{\\uparrow\\downarrow})^2 -(h_{k}^{\\uparrow\\downarrow})^2+\\alpha^{-2}\\right]\\\\   c = & \\alpha^4 \\left[(d_{k}^{\\uparrow\\downarrow})^2-(h_{k}^{\\uparrow\\downarrow})^2+(1+h_k^{\\uparrow\\uparrow})(1+h_{-k}^{\\uparrow\\uparrow})-d_k^{\\uparrow\\uparrow}d_{-k}^{\\uparrow\\uparrow}\\right]^2\\\\ & + \\alpha^4\\left[2d_{k}^{\\uparrow\\downarrow}h_{k}^{\\uparrow\\downarrow}-(1+h_k^{\\uparrow\\uparrow})d_{-k}^{\\uparrow\\uparrow}-d_k^{\\uparrow\\uparrow}(1+h_{-k}^{\\uparrow\\uparrow})\\right]^2\\\\   & + \\alpha^2\\left[2(d_{k}^{\\uparrow\\downarrow})^2-(d_k^{\\uparrow\\uparrow})^2-(d_{-k}^{\\uparrow\\uparrow})^2 - ( h_k^{\\uparrow\\uparrow}-h_{-k}^{\\uparrow\\uparrow})^2\\right ] + 1 \\end{split}\\ ] ]    in total we obtain four energy bands , @xmath160 with a high degree of symmetry : there is only one independent band , and the other three can be obtained by reflecting this over @xmath161 and/or @xmath95 .",
    "two of these bands are redundant solutions stemming from the mathematical formalism used ; the correct bands are the ones that reduce to the two - band solutions in the deep - dilute limit ( these turn out to be @xmath162 and @xmath163 ) .",
    "if we further restrict the system to @xmath73 , the term denoted @xmath164 vanishes , resulting in an equation of the form @xmath165 , from which it is easy to solve @xmath166 : @xmath167 where @xmath168\\\\ c = & \\alpha^4 \\left[(d_{k}^{\\uparrow\\downarrow})^2-(h_{k}^{\\uparrow\\downarrow})^2+(1+h_k^{\\uparrow\\uparrow})^2-(d_k^{\\uparrow\\uparrow})^2\\right]^2\\\\ + & \\alpha^4\\left[\\left(2d_{k}^{\\uparrow\\downarrow}h_{k}^{\\uparrow\\downarrow}-2(1+h_k^{\\uparrow\\uparrow})d_{k}^{\\uparrow\\uparrow}\\right)^2-(d_{k}^{\\uparrow\\downarrow})^2(h_{k}^{\\uparrow\\downarrow})^2\\right]\\\\ + & \\alpha^2\\left[2(d_{k}^{\\uparrow\\downarrow})^2 - 2(d_k^{\\uparrow\\uparrow})^2\\right]+1\\\\ \\end{split}\\ ] ] since the energy only depends on @xmath166 , we only find two separate energy bands , one with negative and one with positive energy and both of which are @xmath24-symmetric .      l. yu , acta phys . sin . *",
