    "<S> @xcite , it is remarkable that almost all existing data from fixed - target to collider energies can be very well understood within perturbative qcd at nlo . in these proceedings , i briefly discuss how prompt photons in nuclear collisions ( @xmath0a and a  a ) may allow for a better understanding of interesting aspects discussed in heavy - ion collisions , namely the physics of nuclear parton distribution functions and medium - modified fragmentation functions . </S>",
    "<S> parton distribution functions in nuclei are so far poorly constrained , especially in contrast with the high degree of accuracy currently reached in the proton channel , over a wide @xmath1 and @xmath2 domain . in particular , only high-@xmath1 ( @xmath3 ) and low @xmath2 ( @xmath4  gev@xmath5 ) have been probed in fixed - target experiments . in order to predict hard processes in nuclear collisions at the lhc , </S>",
    "<S> a more accurate knowledge on a wider kinematic range is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> as stressed in  @xcite , the nuclear production ratio of isolated photons in @xmath0-a collisions , @xmath6 can be related to a good accuracy ( say , less than 5% ) to the parton density ratios @xmath7 with @xmath8 . to illustrate this , the ratio @xmath9 is computed for isolated photons produced at mid - rapidity in @xmath0pb collisions at @xmath10  tev in fig .  </S>",
