    "the nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) center in diamond has attracted much attention in recent years , because it has been shown to give rise to a single optically active level within the diamond band gap  @xcite , and as such provides an interesting candidate for a qubit for quantum computing applications @xcite . besides providing a single photon source for quantum cryptography @xcite ,",
    "the nv center is also a promising candidate as an optically coupled quantum register for scalable quantum information processing , such as quantum communication @xcite and distributed quantum computation @xcite . in addition , it has been recently demonstrated that proximal nuclear spins can be coherently controlled via hyperfine interaction @xcite and used as a basis for quantum memory with an extremely long coherence time @xcite .",
    "therefore , knowing the electron - nucleus hyperfine interaction and its position - dependence is essential to analyze and optimize coherent control of proximal nuclear spins @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the hyperfine constants of the closest atoms near the vacancy are known from electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) and electron - nuclear double resonance ( endor ) studies @xcite . the hyperfine interaction between @xmath0c isotopes",
    "farther from the vacancy contributes to the coherent electron - nuclear spin states in the measurements @xcite . _",
    "ab initio _ supercell calculations can be a very useful tool for determining the hyperfine tensors of a defect .",
    "for instance , such calculations have been used to identify the basic vacancy defects in silicon carbide by comparing the measured and calculated hyperfine constants @xcite . in the present paper we focus on the calculation of the full hyperfine tensor of the nv center in diamond which is of very high importance for qubit applications .",
    "previous theoretical work has reported a calculation of the hyperfine constants of the nv center in a small 64-atom supercell @xcite , but that work determined only the fermi - contact term rather than the full hyperfine tensor .",
    "we will show in the results and discussion section that the conclusions based on that earlier analysis were adversely affected by the small unit cell size .",
    "the larger supercell of 512 atoms employed here does not suffer from this limitation and provides a realistic picture for the defect properties , which are in excellent agreement with experimental measurements .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section ii gives a general discussion of the electronic states of the nv center based on a single - particle picture and the many - body states that can be constructed from this basis .",
    "section iii describes the method of the first - principles calculations we performed .",
    "section iv presents and discusses our results concerning the atomic and electronic structure of the defect , as obtained from the _ ab initio _ calculations . in section",
    "v we present a detailed discussion of the calculated hyperfine interactions . finally , we give our conclusions on the nature of this defect in section vi .",
    "the electronic structure of nv center in diamond has been discussed in detail in a recent paper  @xcite ; we briefly review the main points here .",
    "the nv center was found many years ago in diamond @xcite .",
    "the concentration of nv centers can be enhanced in n - contaminated diamond by irradiation and annealing @xcite .",
    "the model of the nv center consists of a substitutional nitrogen atom adjacent to a vacancy in diamond @xcite .",
    "the nv center has a strong optical transition with a zero phonon line ( zpl ) at 1.945  ev ( 637  nm ) accompanied by a vibronic band at higher energy in absorption and lower energy in emission .",
    "detailed analysis of the zpl revealed that the center has trigonal , c@xmath1 symmetry @xcite .",
    "later , an optically induced epr center was found in diamond which correlated with the nv center @xcite .",
    "the epr center showed trigonal symmetry with a spin polarized triplet state ( s=1 ) .",
    "since the nitrogen atom has five valence electrons and the s=1 state implies even number of electrons , the nv defect must be charged in the epr measurement .",
    "it was assumed that the nv defect is negatively charged and the extra electron may be donated from isolated substitional nitrogen defects @xcite . in a recent measurement ,",
    "the coupling between the nv center and the nitrogen substitional has been indeed detected @xcite .",
    "loubser and van wyk  @xcite measured the nv epr signal just under the optical excitation , based on which they proposed that the spin polarization arises from a singlet electronic system with inter - system crossing to a spin level of a metastable triplet .",
    "redman and co - workers  @xcite detected the nv center in the dark even at 100  k by epr , from which they concluded that the s=1 state is the ground state of the nv center .",
    "hole burning  @xcite , optically detected magnetic resonance  @xcite and raman heterodyne measurements  @xcite also showed the s=1 state to be the ground state of the nv center .",
    "a group theory analysis based on a single - particle picture can be very useful in understanding the nature of the defect states and the possible optical transitions between them .",
    "while the number of electrons in the nv center has been disputed in the literature  @xcite a previous _ ab initio _ calculation clearly supported the negatively charged nv defect @xcite as was originally proposed by loubser and van wyk @xcite .",
    "we will also show in the results and discussion section that the nv center should be negatively charged .    in the nv defect",
    ", three carbon atoms have @xmath2 dangling bonds near the vacancy and three back bonds each to the lattice , while the nitrogen atom has also three back bonds and one dangling bond pointing to the vacant site .",
    "since nitrogen has five valence electrons the negatively charged nv defect has altogether six electrons around the vacant site . the structure of the nv defect , including the definition of the symmetry @xmath3111@xmath4 axis , is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : states ] .",
    "111@xmath4 direction ( right ) ; this direction is the c@xmath5 symmetry axis of the c@xmath1 symmetry group of the defect .",
    "the vacant site is indicated by a small pink circle and the neighboring c and n atoms by grey and cyan balls , respectively .",
    "the first neighbor atoms around the vacant site have @xmath2 dangling bonds pointing toward the vacant site , which are labeled @xmath6 , as in the scheme used in the group theory analysis.,width=321 ]    the group theory analysis of the six electron model has been worked out previously for this defect  @xcite .",
    "we summarize the results using our notation and conventions : since it is known that the carbon and nitrogen atoms relax outward from the vacancy @xcite , we assume that the overlap between the dangling bonds ( @xmath7 ) is negligible , that is , @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath7 are transformed under the operation of c@xmath1 point group forming the following orthonormal states : @xmath9 where @xmath10is a parameter that determines the extent to which the nitrogen dangling bond is mixed in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 defect states .",
    "there are two fully symmetric one - electron states ( @xmath13 ) and one doubly degenerate @xmath14 state , with a total occupation of 6 electrons .",
    "we note here that the dangling bond of nitrogen is _ not _ mixed in the @xmath14 state but only in the @xmath13 states .",
    "it was found by goss _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite using _ ab initio _ molecular cluster calculations that the two @xmath13 states are lower in energy than the @xmath14 state .",
    "as a consequence , four electrons occupy the @xmath13 states and two electrons remain for the @xmath14 state .",
    "our calculated one - electron levels obtained by _ ab initio _ supercell calculations are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : levels ] .    ) and their occupation is given for a negatively charged defect ( a total of 6 electrons).,width=302 ]    as can be seen from this analysis , the natural choice is to put the two remaining electrons in the @xmath14 level forming an s=1 state ( by analogy to hund s rule for the @xmath15-orbitals of the isolated group iv elements in the periodic table ) .    in the c@xmath1 point group",
    "the total wavefunction has @xmath16 symmetry with s=1 . in our special case",
    "we choose @xmath17 , so both electrons are spin - up electrons in the @xmath14 level .",
    "the c@xmath1 symmetry can also be maintained by other occupations of the states .",
    "putting two electrons into four possible quantum states of the degenerate @xmath14 level , we end up with six possible multiplets ( including the degeneracy ) : @xmath16 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 . by taking the @xmath16 to be the ground state of the defect ( as experiments indicate )",
    "there is no allowed optical transition to first order , since the spin state can not be changed in a pl process .",
    "the @xmath11 level is relatively deep in the valence band , so to a good approximation we can assume that it does not contribute to the excitation process .",
    "however , the @xmath12 level in the gap is not very far from the @xmath14 level .",
    "if one electron is excited from @xmath12 into the @xmath14 level ( @xmath20 or @xmath21 ) then either a @xmath22 or a @xmath19 multiplet is obtained .",
    "if both electrons are excited from @xmath12 to @xmath20 and @xmath21 then a fully symmetric @xmath18 state is obtained .",
    "the only allowed transition is @xmath23 to first order .",
    "the electronic configurations of these states are explained in table  [ tab : conf ] .",
    "most of these states were discussed in ref .  .",
    ".[tab : conf ] the electronic configurations and the possible total wave functions with c@xmath1 symmetry .",
    "for simplicity we abbreviate @xmath24 , etc .  in the last column .",
    "overbar in a wavefunction means spin - down electrons , the rest are spin - up electrons .",
    "we assume that @xmath25 is fully occupied , so we do not show that part of the wave function here . in the second and third columns we give the symmetry of the total wavefunction ( @xmath26 ) and its spin projection ( @xmath27 ) , respectively . in the case of doubly degenerate representations ( @xmath28 states )",
    "we designate which transforms as x or y in the last column . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ tab : hyperf ] shows that there is a local maximum of the spin density at r@xmath293.9 and 5.0   , where r@xmath30 is the distance from the vacant site . at r@xmath316.3",
    "  the calculated hyperfine constants are below 1  mhz which means that the spin density vanishes at r@xmath32a@xmath33 .",
    "apparently , the 64-atom supercell is too small to capture these properties due to the artificial overlap of the spin density caused by the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we also find that the charge density does not decay monotonically like an exponential function , but behaves more like a wavepacket , that is , as @xmath34 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hyperf ] ) .     and",
    "a@xmath35 as a function of the distance from the vacant site ( @xmath36 ) for the set of 3 symmetrically equivalent c atoms ( 3c ) . in the inset we show changes farther from the vacant site on a finer scale .",
    "the variation for the set of 6 symmetrically equivalent c atoms follows closely the one shown for 3c.,width=302 ]    it is important to compare the calculated hyperfine values with the known experimental data in order to estimate the accuracy of our calculations . for that purpose",
    ", the hyperfine constant of the n atom is not the best choice because its value is very small and it is caused by only indirect spin - polarization effect . as mentioned above , there is an inherent inaccuracy in the calculated dipole - dipole term of about 0.3  mhz , therefore it is reasonable to consider only values of the hyperfine constants that are significantly larger than this limit .",
    "accordingly , we restrict the comparison to values that are higher than 2  mhz . by comparing the hyperfine constants of the c - ligands we estimate the inaccuracy for both the fermi - contact term and the dipole - dipole term to be about 10% .",
    "this is usual for lsda calculations  @xcite .",
    "the calculated ratio between the fermi - contact term and the dipole - dipole term agrees remarkably well with experiment for the c - ligands .",
    "this shows that the shape of the spin density is very well described by lsda .",
    "this ratio indicates that the @xmath15-functions dominate by about 90% in the dangling bonds , so those are more @xmath15-like orbitals than @xmath2 hybrids .",
    "the reason is most likely the outward relaxation of the c - atoms from the vacant site .",
    "the plotted wavefunctions indeed show a very strong @xmath15-contribution of the @xmath14 levels in fig .  [",
    "fig : wfs ] while the spherical @xmath37-contribution is very small .",
    "the shape of the wave functions can be directly compared to the proposed wave functions in eq .   from the group theory analysis of the defect diagram .",
    "an additional 15  mhz @xmath0c hyperfine splitting was measured by loubser _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite using epr but the measured spectrum of the nv center was not shown in detail , therefore we can not comment on the accuracy of this measurement .",
    "nevertheless , that work stated that the hyperfine splitting is isotropic , that is , the dipole - dipole term is negligible , and the relative intensity of the hyperfine satellite line and the main epr line indicates the involvement of three symmetrically equivalent c atoms @xcite . the likely candidate for this signal is found at the third neighbors of the vacant site at r@xmath30=3.86   .",
    "the spin density of these atoms is shown as yellow lobes above the small green lobes at the highest position on the side view in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin3a2 ] .",
    "the calculated anisotropy of this hyperfine interaction is about 3 - 4  mhz .",
    "if the uncertainty in the measurement is in this range due to line broadening , then the signal could be detected as nearly isotropic .",
    "however , our calculations reveal that six additional c atoms have similar hyperfine splitting at the third neighbor distance of r@xmath30=3.85   , corresponding to the six yellow lobes laterally spread farthest from the vacant site , which is most obvious from the view along the ( 111 ) direction in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin3a2 ] .",
    "this means that the hyperfine splitting due to these six c atoms would have to be detected simultaneously with the other three ones . since the difference in the hyperfine splitting of these two sets of atoms is small , the six - atom set could obscure the signal of the three - atom set showing an effective relative intensity associated with six symmetrically equivalent c atoms .",
    "we suggest that this part of the spectrum should be re - investigated in detail experimentally .",
    "the hyperfine splitting of 7 - 8  mhz from the @xmath0c atom may be also detectable by epr while the other signals may be too small and hence obscured by the main hyperfine lines .",
    "recently , individual nv centers have been detected by spin - echo measurements  @xcite .",
    "in particular , detailed results for six nv centers in diamond have been reported @xcite .",
    "the spin - echo measurements have detected the coherent state of the electron spin coupled with a proximal @xmath0c nucleus .",
    "the coupling is due to hyperfine interaction between the electron spin and the nuclear spin of @xmath0c isotopes .",
    "the resulting spin - echo signals show a rapidly oscillating function enveloped by a more slowly oscillating function  @xcite .",
    "these authors proposed a theory to explain this signal , and they concluded that the fast modulation frequency is due to the effective magnetization density of the electron spin felt by the @xmath0c nucleus , which is the same as the hyperfine interaction . the modulation frequency can be well approximated as the norm of the hyperfine tensor projected to the symmetry axis , which leads to the following expression within our formulation of the problem : @xmath38 \\times a^{(x)}_{ij } \\big)^2}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 $ ] is the appropriate projection vector and @xmath40 is the hyperfine tensor of nucleus @xmath41 . since we calculate the full @xmath40 tensor ( see eq .  ) , the calculation of the modulation frequency is straightforward .",
    "modulation frequencies have been reported for four single nv defects ( see fig .",
    "4b in ref .  ) .",
    "a single modulation frequency was measured for each nv center at @xmath422  mhz , @xmath424  mhz , @xmath429  mhz , and @xmath4214  mhz , respectively , so these particular nv centers had hyperfine interaction with one @xmath0c isotope in the lattice  @xcite .",
    "it would be useful to compare the hyperfine interaction measured by epr and spin - echo techniques which can be an additional validation of the theory developed by childress and co - workers  @xcite .",
    "as was explained earlier , conventional epr tools have limitations in detecting @xmath0c isotopes .",
    "a @xmath0c enriched sample would be useful to study this defect experimentally in more detail .",
    "the largest @xmath0c hyperfine splitting corresponds to a modulation frequency that is too large to be detected by spin - echo measurements .",
    "however , an isotropic @xmath0c hyperfine splitting of 15  mhz has also been reported  @xcite .",
    "the isotropic signal means that the modulation frequency should be also about 15  mhz .",
    "this is very close to one of the measured modulation frequencies at @xmath4214  mhz @xcite . from the calculated hyperfine tensors in table  [ tab : hyperf ] ,",
    "this signal must originate from a c - atom which is a third neighbor of the vacant site at r@xmath30=3.86   .",
    "the calculated modulation frequency is @xmath4216  mhz which is close to the measured one taking into account the limitations of our computational method .",
    "the 9  mhz spin - echo signal can originate only from the atoms at r@xmath30=2.49   , and contributions from other neighbors can be safely excluded . in this way , the origin of the signal can be identified .",
    "the 4  mhz spin - echo signal can originate either from atoms at r@xmath30=2.90    or at r@xmath30=2.93   taking into account computational limitations . in the first case ,",
    "six symmetrically equivalent c atoms are involved , while in the second case a set of three symmetrically equivalent c atoms are involved .",
    "it is difficult , if not impossible , to identify the origin of the 1  mhz spin - echo signal , which is beyond the accuracy of our calculations .",
    "nevertheless , the calculations indicate that this signal could arise from at least 12 c atoms .",
    "most of them are far from the vacant site but some are closer than the atoms that give rise to the @xmath4214  mhz signal , as is evident from figure  [ fig : hyperf ] .",
    "the number of symmetrically equivalent atoms is also specific to the individual hyperfine constant , and therefore to the modulation frequency . because of the c@xmath1 symmetry , sets of three or sets of six c atoms are equivalent with each other .",
    "the relative occurrence of the modulation frequencies measured by spin - echo experiments helps in identifying the equivalent atoms around the vacancy .",
    "four samples represent a rather limited set of values for statistical analysis , so the relative occurrence of @xmath0c isotopes picked up by these measurements can not be used for such analysis . a much larger number of nv samples is needed in the spin - echo measurements in order to use the relative occurrence of the @xmath0c isotope signals for the identification of individual atoms in the diamond lattice .",
    "in this work we investigated the negatively charged nitrogen - vacancy center in diamond in detail by _ ab initio _ supercell calculations using density functional theory methods .",
    "we showed that the energy sequence of multiplet states is @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath19 , @xmath22 , @xmath19 , and @xmath44 .",
    "this means that the singlet @xmath19 state enhances the spin polarization process during the optical cycling of the defect .",
    "the center has non - zero spin ground state .",
    "the full hyperfine tensor for a large number of atoms around the defect was calculated for the first time .",
    "the calculated hyperfine constants of the c ligands agree well with the experimental values detected by electron paramagnetic resonance tools .",
    "however , there is a controversy about the number of symmetrically equivalent carbon atoms of the second highest hyperfine interactions when these are compared to experiment .",
    "we propose that that part of the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum should be re - investigated in detail in order to clarify this issue .",
    "our calculations reveal that the spin density of the ground state is spread in the lattice , mostly on a plane perpendicular to the ( 111 ) direction defined by the positions of the n atom and the vacant site , and that it does not decay monotonically from the vacant site . as a consequence",
    ", only a certain number of @xmath0c isotopes can interact with the electron spin , which can be used as qubits for quantum computing . using the limited number of measurements that have been recently published for single nitrogen - vacancy centers detected by spin - echo measurements",
    ", we were able to identify some individual atoms around the defect .",
    "our results contribute to the understanding of the spin - echo signals of the defect , which is a crucial step towards realization of the qubit concept in this system .",
    "additional spin - echo measurements in nv samples will help identify other individual @xmath0c atoms around the defect .",
