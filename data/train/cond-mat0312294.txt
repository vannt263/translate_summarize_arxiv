    "unusual properties and the richness of the phase diagram of manganites gave rise to a huge number of papers dealing with different aspects of the physics of these compounds .",
    "a special current interest to manganites is related to the possible existence of various inhomogeneous charge and spin states such as lattice and magnetic polarons , droplet and stripe structures , etc .",
    "analogous phenomena are well known for many strongly correlated systems where the electron - electron interaction energy is higher than the kinetic energy .",
    "one of the most spectacular manifestations of such a behavior , i.e. the formation of ferromagnetic ( fm ) droplets ( ferrons ) was predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite for low - doped antiferromagnetic ( afm ) semiconductors .",
    "another example is a formation of a string ( linear trace of frustrated spins ) upon the motion of a hole in an afm isolator @xcite .",
    "both these examples refer to the so - called electron phase separation , when a single charge carrier changes locally its electronic environment .",
    "in addition to this nanoscale phase separation , manganites can also exhibit a large - scale phase separation corresponding to the coexistence of different phases characteristic of first - order phase transitions ( e.g. , the transition between afm and fm states ) .",
    "an example of this large - scale phase separation is given by the formation of relatively large fm droplets inside the afm matrix .",
    "these droplets with linear sizes of about 100 - 1000 were observed in several experiments , in particular , by neutron diffraction methods in ref .",
    "note also that the attraction between one - electron ferromagnetic droplets ( mediated by either elastic or magneto - dipole interaction ) can result in merging of the ferrons and formation of intermediate to large - scale inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "there exist clear experimental indications suggesting that the phase separation is inherent for both magnetically ordered phases and the paramagnetic state @xcite .",
    "therefore , the formation of inhomogeneous states proved to be a typical phenomenon for manganites in different parts of their phase diagram .",
    "moreover , the phase separation should strongly affect the magnetic and transport properties of manganites .",
    "phase separation arguments are most often used for the domain of the existence of antiferromagnetism and especially in the vicinity of a transition between afm and fm states . however , as we mentioned earlier , a manganite can be inhomogeneous even in the paramagnetic state at temperatures exceeding the corresponding phase transition temperature .",
    "an analysis of experimental data reveals a substantial similarity in the high - temperature behavior of resistivity , magnetoresistance , and magnetic susceptibility for various manganites with different low - temperature states @xcite .",
    "in addition , the magnetoresistance turns out to be rather large far from the fm - afm transition and even in the paramagnetic region .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic susceptibility of manganites is substantially higher than that for typical antiferromagnets .",
    "these experimental data clearly suggest the existence of significant fm correlations in the high - temperature range .    here , we start from the assumption that the ferromagnetically correlated regions exist in manganites above the temperatures characterizing the onset of the long - range magnetic ( fm or afm ) ordering .",
    "this assumption allows us to describe the characteristic features of resistivity , magnetoresistance , and magnetic susceptibility of manganites in the non - metallic state within the framework of one model .",
    "below , we base our discussion on the model of conductivity of phase - separated manganites developed in ref .",
    "@xcite and use experimental data for manganites of different compositions reported in ref .  @xcite .",
    "note that in this paper we do not limit ourselves by consideration of only one - electron magnetic droplets ( ferrons ) but rather generalize previously obtained results to the case of arbitrary number of electrons in ferromagnetically correlated domains .    in section  2",
    ", the temperature dependence of resistivity is analyzed for the inhomogeneous state with the density of fm - correlated regions being far from the percolation threshold . in sections  3 and 4 , within the same assumptions , we discuss the magnetoresistance of manganites and their magnetic susceptibility , respectively . as a result , it is shown that the model of inhomogeneous state provides a good description for the high - temperature behavior of manganites.the comparison of theoretical results and experimental data allows us to reveal the general characteristics of ferromagnetically correlated regions .",

    "this energy is of the order of @xmath54 , and substituting permittivity @xmath55 , we get a value of @xmath13 consistent with the experimental data .",
    "it is rather difficult to estimate the tunnelling length @xmath21 .",
    "however , we can say that in the domain of the applicability of relationship  ( [ first ] ) , length @xmath21 can not be much smaller than an interdroplet spacing @xcite .",
    "in another situation , the behavior of the resistivity would be different . in the quasiclassical approximation ,",
    "the tunnelling length is of the order of the characteristic size for the wave function provided the barrier height is comparable with the depth of the potential well . in our case , the size of the electron wave function is of the order of a ferron size , while the height of the barrier practically coincides with the depth of the potential well .",
    "the latter naturally follows from the model of ferron formation @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems reasonable to assume the tunnelling length to be of the same order as a ferron size ( few nanometers ) , though , generally speaking , it can substantially differ from @xmath51 .",
    "it is rather nontrivial task to estimate the concentration @xmath22 of ferrons .",
    "in fact , following the papers @xcite , concentration @xmath22 could be determined by the dopant concentration @xmath56 as @xmath57 . yet",
    "this approach would bring at least two contradictions .",
    "first , even under the moderate concentration of divalent element @xmath58 the droplets should overlap giving rise to the continuous metallic and ferromagnetic cluster .",
    "however , the material could be insulating even at larger concentrations ( @xmath59 ) , at least , in a high - temperature range .",
    "second , as it can be seen from the experimental data , the relation between a dopant concentration and the conductivity of manganites is relatively complicated - for some materials changing @xmath56 by a factor of two can change resistivity by two orders of magnitude @xcite , for other materials @xmath60 exhibits even a nonmonotonic behavior in certain concentration ranges .",
    "note that these discrepancies are essential not only for our model of phase separation but also for other models dealing with the properties of manganites ( e.g. , polaronic models @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the authors of the papers @xcite do not take into account these considerations when analyzing their results from the standpoint of the existing theories of the conductivity in manganites .",
    "the natural conclusion is that the number of carriers , which contribute to the charge transfer processes does not coincide with the concentration of the divalent dopant @xmath56 .",
    "this is particularly obvious in the case of charge ordering when some part of the carriers introduced by doping becomes localized and forms a regular structure .",

    "below we try to present some qualitative arguments illustrating the possible difference in the effective concentration of charge carriers below and above the transition from paramagnetic to magnetically ordered state .    in the phase diagram of a typical manganite , one would have the afm state with fm - phase inclusions in the low - temperature range and at a low doping level .",
    "the transition from afm to fm phase occurs upon doping . at high temperatures , manganites are in the paramagnetic ( pm ) state .",

    "<S> starting from the assumption that ferromagnetically correlated regions exist in manganites even in the absence of long - range magnetic order , we construct a model of charge transfer due to the spin - dependent tunnelling of charge carriers between such regions . </S>",
    "<S> this model allows us to analyze the temperature and magnetic field dependence of resistivity , magnetoresistance , and magnetic susceptibility of phase - separated manganites in the temperature range corresponding to non - metallic behavior . </S>",
