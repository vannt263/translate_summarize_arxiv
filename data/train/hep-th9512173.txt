    "it is well - known that pure electrodynamics is symmetric under the interchange of electricity and magnetism : @xmath5 , or equivalently under the hodge star operation : . ]",
    "@xmath6 this has led to many interesting consequences which have always intrigued physicists @xcite-@xcite and have recently again excited much interest due to the work of seiberg , witten and many others @xcite-@xcite .    in view of the importance of yang - mills theories to particle physics , it is natural to ask whether a similar symmetry exists also for nonabelian gauge fields",
    ". this question can be asked at many different levels .",
    "recently , it is most often addressed at the level of quantum fields , where the yang - mills theory is embedded in a larger theory , usually supersymmetric and existing in a high - dimensional space - time , in which charges , whether electric or magnetic , appear as t hooft - polyakov solitons @xcite . here",
    ", however , we adopt a minimalist approach and ask whether strictly 4-dimensional and nonsupersymmetric yang - mills theory may possess a dual symmetry at the classical field and point charge level . since it is at this level that the maxwell theory exhibits the well - known dual symmetry , it seems reasonable to ask first whether yang - mills theory might possess a generalized version of this symmetry also at the same level .    if duality for nonabelian theories is taken to mean again just the hodge star operation ( [ hodgestar ] ) , then the answer to the above question is no .",
    "the field tensor @xmath7 in the pure maxwell theory satisfies the equations : @xmath8 and : @xmath9 by virtue of ( [ fmunu ] ) , @xmath7 then satisfies the bianchi identity : @xmath10 moreover , because the hodge star operation is reflexive : @xmath11 the maxwell equation of ( [ gausslaw0 ] ) can similarly be interpreted in this abelian case as the bianchi identity for @xmath12 , which then implies by the poincar lemma that there exists a potential @xmath13 such that : @xmath14 one sees therefore that @xmath15 and @xmath16 satisfy formally the same equations , or that electromagnetism is dual symmetric . for the pure nonabelian theory on the other hand , the yang - mills field tensor satisfies , in parallel to ( [ fmunu ] ) and ( [ gausslaw0 ] ) for the abelian case , the equations : @xmath17 , \\label{fmunu}\\ ] ] and : @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the usual covariant derivative : @xmath20 . \\label{covderiv}\\ ] ] although ( [ fmunu ] ) implies again the bianchi identity : @xmath21 this is not the dual of ( [ gausslaw0 ] ) , since the covariant derivative in ( [ gausslawd ] ) involves the potential @xmath1 and not some `` dual potential '' appropriate to @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , the yang - mills equation ( [ gausslaw0 ] ) itself can no longer be interpreted as the bianchi identity for @xmath16 , nor does it imply the existence of a `` dual potential '' @xmath0 satisfying : @xmath22 , \\label{fdmunu}\\ ] ] in parallel to ( [ fmunu ] ) .",
    "indeed , it has been shown by gu and yang @xcite that for certain cases of @xmath15 satisfying ( [ gausslaw0 ] ) there are no solutions for @xmath23 in ( [ fdmunu ] ) , which result shows once and for all that dual symmetry of yang - mills theory under the hodge star operation does not hold .",
    "however , it is not excluded that there may be a generalized dual transform which reduces to the hodge star in the abelian case but for which there is still an electric - magnetic dual symmetry for nonabelian yang - mills theory .",
    "in fact , in an earlier paper @xcite , we have already suggested a generalized dual transform which was able to reproduce many of what one may call the dual properties of the abelian theory though not as yet the complete dual symmetry . the missing link in the arguments there for obtaining a nonabelian dual symmetry was again the existence or otherwise of a local dual potential @xmath0 for yang - mills fields .",
    "although a local quantity @xmath0 did appear which functioned as the parallel transport for the phase of colour magnetic charges exactly as a dual potential should , we were unable to show that this @xmath0 can reproduce all field quantities - meaning that it gives a complete description of the theory .",
    "as a result of this failure our treatment there , though having some desirable features , remained far from being dual symmetric .",
    "what we shall do in this paper is to show that a generalized dual symmetry does exist for nonabelian yang - mills theory , and that the dual phase transport @xmath0 introduced in @xcite does function also as a dual potential in that it gives a full description of the theory and plays an entirely dual symmetric role to the standard gauge potential @xmath1 .",
    "this result is achieved by writing down a dual transform between two new sets of variables which allows us to reformulate the whole theory in an explicitly dual fashion . indeed ,",
    "although the new results are derived on the basis of results obtained before , the new dual symmetric formulation is so much neater than the old that we shall find it easier to derive some of the old results again together with the new than to refer back to the older derivations .",
    "we shall therefore work throughout with the new dual formulation and only return in the end to sort out the relationship with the older treatment .",
    "a dual symmetry for yang - mills fields means in particular that colour electric charges ( i.e. ordinary colour charges such as quarks ) which are usually taken to be sources of the yang - mills field can also be considered as monopoles of the dual field in the same way as colour magnetic charges are monopoles of the yang - mills field .",
    "it follows therefore that electric and magnetic charges , in nonabelian as in abelian theories , have basically the same dynamics , namely that given by the standard maxwell and yang - mills equations , only formulated in a dual manner .",
    "furthermore , since the relation here between the field and the dual field though somewhat complicated is explicitly known , the result may have brought us one step nearer to realizing the hope of obtaining the strong coupling limit of one formulation from the weak coupling limit of its dual by making use of the generalized dirac condition : @xmath24 relating the magnitudes of electric and magnetic couplings for a theory with gauge group @xmath25 .",
    "in our previous paper @xcite on yang - mills duality we have relied heavily on a loop space technique developed earlier , using the polyakov variables @xmath27 $ ] to describe the gauge field @xcite .",
    "these variables @xmath27 $ ] take values in the gauge lie algebra , depend on the parametrized loop @xmath28 only up to the point on @xmath28 labelled by the value @xmath29 of this parameter , and have only components transverse to the loop at that point .",
    "they are known to give a complete description of the yang - mills theory but are highly redundant as all loop variables are , and have to be constrained by an infinite set of conditions which is most conveniently stated as the vanishing of the loop space curvature : @xcite @xmath30 = 0 , \\label{gausslawl}\\ ] ] where : @xmath30 = \\delta_\\nu(s ) f_\\mu[\\xi|s ] - \\delta_\\mu(s ) f_\\nu[\\xi|s ]     + ig [ f_\\mu[\\xi|s ] , f_\\nu[\\xi|s ] ] , \\label{gmunu}\\ ] ] and @xmath31 denotes the loop derivative @xmath32 at @xmath29 .",
    "one great virtue of @xmath27 $ ] as variables is that they are gauge independent apart from an innocuous @xmath33-independent gauge rotation at the fixed reference point @xmath34 for the parametrized loops .    in discussing dual properties ,",
    "however , it was found convenient to introduce another set of quantities @xmath26 $ ] which were defined as : @xmath35 = \\phi_\\xi(s,0 ) f_\\mu[\\xi|s ] \\phi^{-1}_\\xi(s,0 ) , \\label{emuxis}\\ ] ] where : @xmath36 is the parallel phase transport from the point at @xmath37 to the point at @xmath38 along the loop @xmath28 .",
    "hence , in order to exhibit more clearly the dual properties of the theory , it is our intention here to adopt these @xmath26 $ ] instead of @xmath27 $ ] as field variables .",
    "our first task is to demonstrate that this is possible under conditions which we shall have to specify .",
    "recall first that the polyakov variable @xmath27 $ ] is defined as : @xmath39 = \\frac{i}{g } \\phi^{-1}[\\xi ] \\delta_\\mu(s ) \\phi[\\xi ] , \\label{fmuxis}\\ ] ] where : @xmath40 = p_s \\exp ig \\int_0^{2\\pi } ds a_\\mu(\\xi(s ) ) \\dot{\\xi}^\\mu(s ) , \\label{phixi}\\ ] ] or @xmath41 as defined in ( [ phixis2s1 ] ) , so that @xmath27 $ ] can be pictured as in figure [ fmuxisfig ] , where    the @xmath42-function @xmath43 inherent in our definition of the loop derivative$ ] of the parametrized loop @xmath28 , we defined @xcite the loop derivative @xmath44 as : @xmath45 = \\lim_{\\delta \\rightarrow 0 }     \\frac{1}{\\delta } \\{\\psi[\\xi ' ] - \\psi[\\xi]\\},\\nonumber\\ ] ] with : @xmath46 in case of ambiguity , @xmath47 in the expression above for @xmath48 is replaced by a bump - function with width @xmath49 and height @xmath50 , and the limit @xmath51 with @xmath52 held fixed is taken first , to be followed by the limit @xmath53 . ]",
    "@xmath31 is represented in the figure as a bump function centred at @xmath29 with width @xmath54 .",
    "in the same spirit , the quantity @xmath26 $ ] defined in ( [ emuxis ] ) can be pictured as the bold curve in figure [ emuxisfig ]    where the phase factors @xmath55 in ( [ emuxis ] ) have cancelled parts of the circuit in figure [ fmuxisfig ] .",
    "in contrast to @xmath27 $ ] , therefore , @xmath26 $ ] is dependent really only on a `` segment '' of the loop @xmath28 from @xmath56 to @xmath57 .",
    "the reason for representing the @xmath42-function in figures [ fmuxisfig ] and [ emuxisfig ] as a bump function is that , as in most functional formulations , our treatment here involves some operations with the @xmath42-function which need to be `` regularized '' to be given a meaning .",
    "our procedure is to take first the @xmath42-function as a bump function with finite width , and then afterwards take the appropriate zero width limit .",
    "for example , we shall need later the loop derivative @xmath58 of the quantity @xmath26 $ ] at the same value of @xmath29 .",
    "clearly , a loop derivative has a meaning only if there is a segment of the loop on which it can operate .",
    "therefore , to define this derivative , we shall first regard @xmath26 $ ] as a segmental quantity dependent on the segment of the loop @xmath28 from @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "we then define the loop derivative @xmath58 using the normal procedure on this segment , and afterwards take the limit @xmath51 . in case a repeated loop derivative of @xmath26 $ ] is required at the same @xmath29 , then the @xmath42-function inherent in the first derivative has again to be represented by a bump function of finite width , say @xmath61 , so that the second derivative can be defined on this segment of the loop .",
    "afterwards , we take first the limit @xmath62 , and then the limit @xmath51 , in that order . in view of these regularization procedures , it is often convenient to picture the quantities @xmath27 $ ] and @xmath26 $ ] as in figures [ fmuxisfig ] and [ emuxisfig ] .    to show now that @xmath26 $ ] do constitute a valid set of variables for a full description of the gauge field ,",
    "we note first that by ( [ emuxis ] ) and ( [ fmuxis ] ) we have : @xmath63 = \\phi_\\xi(s,0 ) \\ { \\delta_\\nu(s ' ) f_\\mu[\\xi|s ]     + ig \\theta(s - s ' ) [ f_\\nu[\\xi|s ' ] , f_\\mu[\\xi|s ] ] \\ } \\phi_\\xi^{-1}(s,0 ) , \\label{difemuxis}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the heaviside @xmath65-function , so that : @xmath30 = \\phi_\\xi^{-1}(s,0 ) \\{\\delta_\\nu(s ) e_\\mu[\\xi|s ]     - \\delta_\\mu(s ) e_\\nu[\\xi|s]\\ } \\phi_\\xi(s,0 ) , \\label{gmunuine}\\ ] ] and the condition ( [ gausslawl ] ) translated in terms of @xmath26 $ ] reads as : @xmath66 - \\delta_\\mu(s ) e_\\nu[\\xi|s ] = 0 .",
    "\\label{gausslawe}\\ ] ] hence , since we already know that @xmath27 $ ] constrained by ( [ gausslawl ] ) describes the gauge theory , we want now to show that given a set of @xmath27 $ ] satisfying ( [ gausslawl ] ) we recover a set of @xmath26 $ ] satisfying ( [ gausslawe ] ) and vice versa .",
    "the direct statement is easy to see .",
    "given @xmath27 $ ] satisfying ( [ gausslawl ] ) , we know from the so - called extended poincar lemma derived in @xcite that we can recover a local potential @xmath1 , from which a parallel transport @xmath55 by ( [ phixis2s1 ] ) , and hence also an @xmath26 $ ] by ( [ emuxis ] ) can be constructed .",
    "this @xmath26 $ ] will automatically satisfy ( [ gausslawe ] ) as we wanted .",
    "what is less obvious is the converse statement , namely that given a set of @xmath26 $ ] satisfying ( [ gausslawe ] ) , one can also recover a set of @xmath27 $ ] satisfying ( [ gausslawl ] ) . to see this , one notes first that given ( [ gausslawe ] ) , it follows that there exists some @xmath67 $ ] such that : @xmath35 = \\delta_\\mu(s ) w[\\xi|s ] .",

    "however , we have actually glossed over a rather important point , namely that in writing ( [ difphixis0 ] ) we have used ( [ wxis ] ) in which , by our procedure detailed above , @xmath67 $ ] ought first to be regarded as a `` segmental quantity '' depending on a segment of @xmath28 with width @xmath54 , and only after the loop differentiation has been performed is the segmental width @xmath49 to be taken to zero . on the other hand , in defining @xmath55 in terms of @xmath67 $ ] , one wants already in ( [ phixis0inw ] ) to take the limit @xmath51 . to assert both statements therefore ,",
    "we shall need a composition law for @xmath72 which says that the factor @xmath77)$ ] for a small finite segment is in fact the same as the product of such factors for those infinitesimal segments which make up this small finite segment . that such a composition law holds can be seen by an argument parallel to",
    "that given in @xcite for deriving the composition law for @xmath78 $ ] by writing it in terms of @xmath27 $ ] as a surface integral .",
    "here , the line integral in loop space ( [ defwxis ] ) representing @xmath67 $ ] is also in fact a surface integral in ordinary space - time for which a similar argument is seen to apply .",
    "that being the case , we conclude that @xmath26 $ ] constrained by ( [ gausslawe ] ) do constitute a valid set of variables for describing the gauge field , which we shall adopt later for discussing its dual properties .",
    "note that , in contrast to the polyakov variables @xmath27 $ ] , the variables @xmath26 $ ] are gauge dependent quantities and so , though more convenient than @xmath27 $ ] for studying duality , may not be so useful otherwise .",
    "we note further that the fact we are able to recover from @xmath26 $ ] satisfying ( [ gausslawe ] ) the polyakov variables @xmath27 $ ] satisfying ( [ gausslawl ] ) means also by the extended poincar lemma of @xcite that there exists a local potential @xmath1 such that the parallel transport is indeed given by ( [ phixis2s1 ] ) . in turn",
    ", this implies that : @xmath79 = \\lim_{s_+ \\rightarrow s_- }     \\frac{i}{g } \\{\\phi_\\xi(s_+,s_- ) - 1\\ } = a_\\mu(\\xi(s ) ) \\dot{\\xi}^\\mu(s ) , \\label{amuxinw}\\ ] ] and that : @xmath80 = f_{\\mu\\nu}(\\xi(s ) ) \\dot{\\xi}^\\nu(s ) , \\label{fmunuxine}\\ ] ] with @xmath15 given as usual in ( [ fmunu ] ) in terms of the @xmath1 defined in ( [ amuxinw ] ) above .",
    "these two formulae will be of use to us later .",
    "as noted above in the introduction , hodge star duality does not lead to a dual symmetry for nonabelian yang - mills theory .",
    "we seek therefore a generalized dual transform , if such exists , which may restore dual symmetry to yang - mills theory .",
    "the experience gained in earlier work leads us to believe that such a transform is best written in terms of the variables @xmath26 $ ] introduced in the preceding section .",
    "we seek a dual transform with the following 3 properties .",
    "first , we want , of course , that the new dual transform reduces back to the hodge star ( [ hodgestar ] ) for the abelian theory , but that it should not do so for the nonabelian case or else the conclusion of gu and yang in @xcite would be violated .",
    "secondly , in order for the new transform to qualify as a dual transform , we want it to be invertible in the sense that , like the hodge star , application of the transform twice should give the identity , apart perhaps from a sign .",
    "thirdly , we want the transform to be such that , again like the hodge star in the abelian case , an electric charge defined as a source of the direct field should appear as a monopole of the dual field , while a magnetic charge defined as a source of the dual field should appear as a monopole of the direct field .",
    "this last property seems to us to be the crucial feature which gives dual symmetry to the abelian theory and which , we have reason to believe from past experience , may give dual symmetry also to yang - mills fields .",
    "our suggestion is as follows .",
    "given a set of variables @xmath26 $ ] describing the gauge field , we introduce a corresponding dual set of variables @xmath81 $ ] labelled by @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where @xmath82 is just another parametrized loop with parameter @xmath83 which are distinguished here by different symbols from @xmath28 and @xmath29 for convenience . for",
    "given @xmath82 and @xmath83 , @xmath81 $ ] is defined as : @xmath84 \\omega(\\eta(t ) ) = -\\frac{2}{\\bar{n } }     \\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma } \\dot{\\eta}^\\nu(t ) \\int \\delta\\xi ds     e^\\rho[\\xi|s ] \\dot{\\xi}^\\sigma(s ) \\dot{\\xi}^{-2}(s ) \\delta(\\xi(s)-\\eta(t ) ) , \\label{newduality}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is just a local rotational matrix allowing for the freedom of transforming from the `` @xmath86''-frame in which direct quantities like @xmath26 $ ] are represented to a `` @xmath87''-frame in which dual quantities like @xmath81 $ ] are represented , and @xmath88 a normalization factor ( infinite ) defined as : @xcite @xmath89    as ( [ newduality ] ) involves an implicit regularization procedure , i.e. a fixed order in which various limits are taken , some explanation is in order . the loop integral on the right - hand side of ( [ newduality ] ) , as for the loop derivative discussed in the preceding section , needs a segment of the loop @xmath28 on which to operate .",
    "hence , @xmath90 $ ] has first again to be regarded as a segmental quantity depending on a little segment of @xmath28 from @xmath56 to @xmath57 whose width @xmath54 is taken to zero only after the integration has been performed . in the same spirit ,",
    "@xmath91 in the integrand is meant to represent the quantity @xmath92 which becomes the tangent to the loop @xmath28 at @xmath29 when @xmath93 .",
    "if one is interested only in the value of @xmath81 $ ] and not , say , in its derivatives , then @xmath81 $ ] can be taken as just a function of the point @xmath94 labelled by @xmath83 on the loop @xmath82 and of the tangent @xmath95 to the loop at that point . in that case",
    ", the @xmath42-function @xmath96 on the right says that the segment @xmath28 has to pass through at @xmath29 the point @xmath94 but is otherwise freely integrated so that @xmath97 can have any direction relative to @xmath95 , except that the contribution to the integral vanishes when @xmath91 is parallel to @xmath95 because of the @xmath98 symbol in front .",
    "however , if we wish to evaluate the loop derivative @xmath99 of @xmath81 $ ] using the formula ( [ newduality ] ) , then @xmath81 $ ] itself has also to be regarded as a segmental quantity depending on a segment of @xmath82 from @xmath100 to @xmath101 with width @xmath102 .",
    "after the differentiation has been performed , one can then take the limit @xmath62 , and our procedure says that this limit should be taken before the limit @xmath51 for the integral .",

    "the dual transform ( [ newduality ] ) let us now examine whether colour electric charges do indeed appear as monopoles of the dual field @xmath81 $ ] , which property , as stated above , we believe to be crucial for dual symmetry .",
    "we recall first that a colour electric charge is usually defined as a source of the yang - mills field , namely a nonvanishing covariant divergence @xmath110 .",
    "equivalently , according to polyakov @xcite , it is a nonvanishing loop divergence @xmath111 $ ] of the loop variable @xmath27 $ ] . alternatively again , since ( [ difemuxis ] ) implies that : @xmath112 = \\phi_\\xi(s,0 ) \\{\\delta^\\mu(s ) f_\\mu[\\xi|s]\\ }     \\phi_\\xi^{-1}(s,0 ) , \\label{diveinf}\\ ] ] it also means a nonvanishing loop divergence @xmath113 $ ] of the variable @xmath26 $ ] adopted here . on the other hand , a colour magnetic charge defined as a monopole of the yang - mills field is characterized most easily as a nonvanishing loop space curvature @xcite @xmath76 $ ] as defined in ( [ gmunu ] ) , or alternatively , by ( [ gmunuine ] ) in terms of @xmath26 $ ] , as a nonvanishing `` curl '' @xmath114 - \\delta_\\mu(s ) e_\\nu[\\xi|s]$ ] . by a monopole of the dual field @xmath115 we mean",

    "@xmath219 appeared first in @xcite in the defining constraint for the `` magnetic '' current : @xmath30 = - 4\\pi j_{\\mu\\nu}[\\xi|s ] , \\label{gausslawf}\\ ] ] where for a classical point charge we had : @xmath172 = \\tilde{g } \\kappa[\\xi|s ] \\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma }     \\int d\\tau \\frac{dy^\\rho(\\tau)}{d\\tau } \\dot{\\xi}^\\sigma(s )     \\delta(\\xi(s)-y(\\tau ) ) , \\label{jmunucold}\\ ] ] with : @xmath220 = \\phi_\\xi^{-1}(s_+,0 ) { \\cal k}(\\tau ) \\phi_\\xi(s_+,0 ) , \\label{kappaxis}\\ ] ] and @xmath173 a local quantity , while for a dirac point charge we had : @xmath172 = \\tilde{g } \\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma }     [ \\bar{\\psi}(\\xi(s ) ) \\omega(\\xi(s ) ) \\gamma^\\rho t^i \\omega^{-1}(\\xi(s ) )     \\psi(\\xi(s ) ) ] \\phi^{-1}_\\xi(s_+,0 ) t_i \\phi_\\xi(s_+,0 ) .",
    "\\label{jmunuqold}\\ ] ] these expressions differ from ( [ jmunuc ] ) and ( [ jmunuq ] ) of this paper by the factor @xmath219 and its inverse , where we note that the argument is @xmath57 and not @xmath29 as elsewhere in this paper . instead of @xmath221 as we do here to indicate that it was not affected by loop differentiation , but this is in fact unnecessary in view of the footnote of section 3 . ]",
    "that these factors should be there in ( [ jmunucold ] ) and ( [ jmunuqold ] ) for consistency but not in ( [ jmunuc ] ) and ( [ jmunuq ] ) can be seen as follows .",
    "the loop space curvature @xmath76 $ ] as exhibited in ( [ gmunu ] ) satisfies the bianchi identity : @xmath222 = 0 , \\label{bianchif}\\ ] ] where @xmath223 denotes the `` covariant loop derivative '' : @xmath224 , \\ \\ \\ ] .",
    "\\label{covderivl}\\ ] ] hence , the current @xmath197 $ ] on the right - hand side of ( [ gausslawf ] ) must also satisfy this identity , which it does if it contains the factors @xmath219 and @xmath225 as shown in ( [ jmunucold ] ) and ( [ jmunuqold ] ) , but will not do so without these factors . on the other hand , although in the equation ( [ gausslawej ] ) which is the equivalent to ( [ gausslawf ] ) in terms of @xmath26 $ ] , the current must also satisfy a similar identity ( [ bianchie ] ) , this involves only the ordinary loop derivative @xmath31 , and not the covariant loop derivative @xmath223 . the expressions ( [ jmunuc ] ) and ( [ jmunuq ] )",
    "have thus no need for the phase factors @xmath219 and @xmath226 .",
    "this difference between the `` currents '' in the two treatments means that the corresponding lagrange multipliers , namely @xmath227 $ ] in the old and @xmath159 $ ] in the new , are also related by a conjugation with respect to @xmath219 , from which it follows that the dual potential @xmath0 defined in @xcite , in spite of appearances , is in fact identical to that defined here in ( [ adinwmunu ] ) .",
    "the above observation serves as a further example for the delicate handling often required in loop space operations , which we consider as a weakness of the whole loop space approach .",
    "although we believe we have considerably improved our understanding in the present work , sufficiently in fact to clarify one or two subtle points such as that in the wong equation noted in the footnote of section 5 which we have not been able to make clear before , we still feel strongly the lack of a general calculus for handling complex loop space operations , the construction of which however is unfortunately beyond our present capability .    apart from this reservation , we find the result of the present paper rather gratifying in that it seems to have answered the long - standing question whether there is a dual symmetry for yang - mills theory and gives even an explicit , though rather complicated , transformation between dual variables , which is being sought for in other duality contexts .",
    "for us in particular , it seems to have answered also a question that we have been asking on and off for some years concerning the dynamical properties of nonabelian monopoles .",
    "the answer to this turns out to be staggeringly simple , namely that monopole dynamics is the same as that described by the standard theory for yang - mills sources , only formulated in the dual fashion . in consequence , one need not enquire , at least at the classical field level so far studied , whether the charges one sees in nature are sources or monopoles unless both types exist , for otherwise there will be no way to distinguish them .",
    "this is a rather unexpected result in view of the fact that sources and monopoles are initially conceived as very different objects , the former being essentially algebraic and the latter topological , and that the dynamics is determined here via the wu - yang criterion by the topology in an entirely different fashion from the manner that interactions for sources are usually introduced .",
    "one of us ( tst ) thanks the wingate foundation for partial support , while another ( jf ) thanks the particle theory group of the rutherford appleton laboratory for hospitaility during her summer visit there when part of this work was done .",
