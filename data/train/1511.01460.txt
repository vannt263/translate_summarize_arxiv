    "they construct the jump process as a linear combination of two independent lvy processes representing the systematic factor and the idiosyncratic shock , respectively ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it has an intuitive economic interpretation and retains nice tractability , as the multivariate characteristic function in this model is available in closed form based on the following proposition of @xcite :    [ propballotta ] [ prop0 ] let @xmath24 be independent lvy processes on a probability space @xmath25 , with characteristic functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 , for @xmath28 respectively . then , for @xmath29 @xmath30 is a lvy process on @xmath31 .",

    "the first and the last steps are pure advection - diffusion problems and could be solved using , e.g. , a finite difference method proposed in @xcite . we , however , slightly modified it by replacing an explicit scheme for the mixed derivative operators with the implicit ones . the detailed description of this approach as well as our reasons for doing that are given in the next section .",
    "we follow @xcite , who consider the unconditional stability of second - order finite - difference schemes used to numerically solve multi - dimensional diffusion problems containing mixed spatial derivatives .",
    "they investigate the adi scheme proposed by craig and sneyd ( see references in the paper ) , a modified version of craig and sneyd s adi scheme , and the adi scheme introduced by hundsdorfer and verwer .",
    "the necessary conditions are derived on the parameters of each of these schemes for unconditional stability in the presence of mixed derivative terms .",
    "for example , let us choose a hv scheme .",
    "the main result of @xcite is that under some mild conditions on the parameter @xmath66 of the scheme , the second - order hundsdorfer and verwer ( hv ) scheme is unconditionally stable when applied to semi - discretized diffusion problems with mixed derivative terms in an arbitrary spatial dimension @xmath67 .",
    "for the 3d convection - diffusion problem in with @xmath64 , the hv scheme defines an approximation @xmath68 , @xmath69 , by performing a series of ( fractional ) steps : @xmath70 , \\",

    ". this scheme is of order two in time for any value of @xmath66 , so this parameter can be chosen to meet additional requirements , @xcite .",
    "an advantage of this scheme is that the fractional steps with mixed derivatives , i.e. 1 and 5 , are solved by using an explicit scheme . at the same time",
    "this could bring a problem , because a very careful approximation of the mixed derivative term is required to preserve the stability and positivity of the solution .",
    "sometimes this requires very small step in time to be chosen .    in the 2d case to resolve this rather delicate issue a seven - point stencil for discretization of the mixed - derivative operator that preserves the positivity of the solution",
    "was proposed in @xcite for correlations @xmath72 , and in @xcite for positive correlations . however , in their schemes the mixed derivative term was treated implicitly ( that is the reason they needed a discretized matrix to be an m - matrix ) . in our case",
    "the entire matrix in the right - hand side of steps 3,5 should be either a positive matrix , or a metzler matrix ( in this case the negative of an m - matrix ) .",
    "the latter can be achieved when using approximations of @xcite and @xcite in an opposite order , i.e. use approximations recommended for @xmath73 when @xmath72 , and vice versa . however , due to the nature of the 7-point stencil , they are not able to provide a rigorous second order approximation of the mixed derivatives .",
    "in our numerical experiments even using these explicit analogs of the mixed derivatives approximation in the 3d case was not always sufficient .",
    "indeed , either we use real second order approximation of the mixed derivatives relying on the fact that in the hv splitting scheme @xmath74 comes only as a part of @xmath75 . hence , the negative terms in @xmath74 can be partly or even fully compensated by the other terms .",
    "unfortunately , at some values of the model parameters this could be insufficient to provide the total positivity of the solution .",
    "or we use the 7-points stencil which works well for the implicit scheme ( for the reasons which will became clear in appendix  [ apppos ] when proving our theorem ) , but still does nt provide a necessary stability for the explicit scheme .",
    "thus , one has to choose a very small step in time , which is impractical .",
    "therefore , in this paper to provide an additional stability of the whole splitting scheme we modified this step as follows .",
    "the main idea is to sacrifice the simplicity of the explicit representation of the mixed derivative term for the better stability .",
    "that is what was done in @xcite who dealt with a 2d case and used an implicit approximation of the mixed derivatives term .",
    "however , in this paper we propose another approach .",
    "consider the first step in .",
    "since here only the first order approximation in time is necessary , this step can be re - written in two steps @xmath76v^*(\\tau ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "so efficiently at the first sub - splitting step we take a liberty to solve the first equation of as we like , and the remaining part ( the second sub - step ) is treated explicitly , e.g. in the same way as in the hv scheme .",
    "now , a general solution of this first equation in can be written in the operator form as @xmath79 again , with @xmath80 @xmath81 or using splitting @xmath82 the order of the splitting steps usually does nt matter .",
    "accordingly , it is sufficient to consider just one step in since the others can be done in the similar way .",
    "for example , below let us consider step 1 .",
    "first , we use pde approximation ( 0,1 ) which provides approximation of the first line in with the first order in @xmath83 , and is implicit .",
    "approximation wise this is equivalent to the first line of .",
    "having that , the first equation in transforms to @xmath84 v^{(1 ) } = v(\\tau).\\ ] ] second , we again rewrite it using a trick @xmath85v^{(1 ) } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 are some positive numbers which have to be chosen based on some conditions , e.g. , to provide diagonal dominance of the matrices in the parentheses in the lhs of , see below .",
    "the intuition for this representation is as follows .",
    "suppose we need to solve some parabolic pde and represent the solution in the form of a matrix exponential @xmath87 . since computing the matrix exponential might be expensive , to preserve the second order approximation in @xmath88 one can use a second order pde approximation . in this case , e.g. , a popular crank - nicholson scheme preserves positivity of the solution only if the negative diagonal elements @xmath89 of @xmath90 obey the condition @xmath91 .",
    "this efficiently issues some limitations on the time step @xmath88 . as a resolution ,",
    "e.g. , in @xcite higher order fully implicit pde approximations were proposed to be used instead of the crank - nicholson scheme .",
    "this solves the problem with getting a positive solution since @xmath92[y-(1-\\imath ) ] , \\qquad y \\equiv \\dtau j , \\quad \\imath = \\sqrt{-1},\\ ] ] and by using an appropriate discretization each matrix in the parentheses can be made an m - matrix which inverse is a non - negative matrix .",
    "this can be done when @xmath93 is a 1d parabolic operator .",
    "performance - wise , this , however , gives rise to solving few ( e.g. , 2 in the case of pde ( 0,2 ) approximation ) systems of linear equations with complex numbers .",
    "hence , the complexity of the solution is , at least , 4 times worse .",
    "our representation aims to utilize a similar idea , but being transformed to the iterative method .",
    "the key point here is that we use a theory of em - matrices ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and manage to propose a second order approximation of the first derivative which makes our matrices to be real em - matrices .",
    "so again , the inverse of the latter is a positive matrix .",
    "can be solved using fixed - point picard iterations .",
    "one can start with setting @xmath94 in the rhs of , then solve sequentially two systems of equations @xmath95v^k , \\nonumber \\\\ \\big(p & - \\sdt \\rho_{s , v } w(s ) \\triangledown_s \\big)v^{k+1 } = v^*. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath96 is the value of @xmath97 at the @xmath98-th iteration .    before constructing a finite difference scheme to solve this equation we need to introduce some definitions .",
    "define a one - sided _ forward _ discretization of @xmath99 , which we denote as @xmath100/h$ ] .",
    "also define a one - sided _ backward _ discretization of @xmath99 , denoted as @xmath101/h$ ] .",
    "these discretizations provide first order approximation in @xmath102 , e.g. , @xmath103 . to provide the second order approximations , use the following definitions .",
    "define @xmath104 - the _ central _ difference approximation of the second derivative @xmath105 , and @xmath106 - the _ central _ difference approximation of the first derivative @xmath99 . also define a one - sided second order approximations to the first derivatives : _ backward _ approximation @xmath107/(2 h)$ ] , and _ forward _ approximation @xmath108/(2 h)$ ] .",
    "also @xmath109 denotes a unit matrix .",
    "all these definitions assume that we work on a uniform grid , however this could be easily generalized for the non - uniform grid as well , see , e.g. , @xcite .    for solving",
    "we propose two fd schemes .",
    "the first one ( scheme  a ) is introduced by the following propositions :    [ proppos ] let us assume @xmath110 , and approximate the lhs of using the following finite - difference scheme : @xmath111 then this scheme is unconditionally stable in time step @xmath83 , approximates with @xmath112 and preserves positivity of the vector @xmath113 if @xmath114 , where @xmath115 are the grid space steps correspondingly in @xmath1 and @xmath0 directions , and the coefficient @xmath116 must be chosen to obey the condition : @xmath117.\\ ] ]    see appendix  [ apppos ] .",
    "if @xmath118 , then the whole scheme becomes of the second order in space . however , this would be a serious restriction inherent to the explicit schemes .",
    "therefore , in this paper we do nt rely on it .",
    "note , that in practice the time step is usually chosen such that @xmath119 , and hence the whole scheme is expected to be closer to the second , rather than to the first order in @xmath102 . as it has been already mentioned , this is similar to @xcite for correlations @xmath72 , and @xcite for positive correlations , where a seven point stencil breaks a rigorous second order of approximation in space .",

    "once again we want to underline that the described approach to deal with the mixed derivative term supplies just the first order approximation in time .",

    "a small but important improvement , however , must be made for the second equation in since the definition of @xmath127 contains @xmath128 which is a dummy variable for this equation .",
    "accordingly , as this equation should be solved in a loop on @xmath129 , where @xmath130 are the nodes on the @xmath1-grid , and @xmath131 is the number of these nodes , for each such a step its own @xmath132 must be computed based on the condition @xmath133.\\ ] ] this , however , does nt bring any problem .    for the reference",

    "based on this definition , the matrices @xmath138 can be constructed accordingly .      for even better stability",

    "the remaining steps can be done similar to the steps 2 - 4 in the hv scheme .",
    "thus , the whole first step in the hv scheme becomes implicit while has the same linear complexity in the number of nodes .",
    "also our experiments confirm that this scheme provides great stability and preserves positivity of the solution .",
    "therefore , running first few rannacher steps is not necessary .",

    "therefore , it can be solved in the exactly same way as the first step of our fully implicit scheme .",
    "note that both scheme  a and scheme  b can be used as a part of the fully implicit scheme .",
    "if one makes a choice in favor of scheme  a , then the situation is as follows .",
    "we have the first step of the fully implicit scheme done with approximation @xmath145 , and then multiple steps ( six for the 3d problem ) with the second order in space , so the total approximation is expected to be close to two . for the second sweep of the hv scheme this is same .",
    "if the choice is made in favor of scheme  b , the rigorous spatial approximation of the whole hv scheme becomes two .",
    "an obvious disadvantage of the proposed schemes is some degradation of performance , since it requires some number of iterations to converge , but the rate of this convergence should be studied in more detail .",
    "we leave it for the future investigation .",
    "] when computing the mixed derivatives step , and at every iteration we need to solve 2 systems of linear equations . despite the total complexity",
    "is still linear in the number of nodes , it takes about 4 times more computational time than the explicit scheme .",
    "however , as we have already mentioned , in our experiments the explicit scheme at the first and the third steps of suffers from the curse of dimensionality , i.e. , either it requires a very small and impractical temporal step to converge , or , otherwise , it explodes .",
    "also our results show that the proposed scheme is only about 50 - 70% slower than the explicit step of the original hv scheme . however , the time step of our scheme can be significantly increased with no any stability issues , while this could be problematic for the hv scheme .",
    "therefore , this increase in the time step could compensate the extra time required for doing the first step implicitly .",
    "for instance , running one step in time for the 3d advection - diffusion problem using the hv scheme coded in matlab , at our machine takes 2 secs , while the fully implicit scheme requires 2.6 secs . on contrary",
    ", the hv scheme behaves kind of unstable with no rannacher steps even with @xmath146 yrs , while the fully implicit scheme continues to work well , e.g. , with @xmath147 yrs as in the above .",
    "however , changing the first multiplier in the rhs of can make the scheme working for the higher values of the time step as well . ] .",
    "so if by the accuracy reason this step is sufficient , it can improve performance by factor 10 , and then loosing about 50 - 70% for the implicit scheme is not sensitive .    note , that the same approach can be applied to the forward equations based on the approach of @xcite . in more detail",
    "this will be presented elsewhere .",
    "once this step is accomplished , the whole scheme becomes positivity - preserving .",
    "this is because for the first step of our fully implicit scheme does preserve positivity .",
    "the next steps can be re - written in the form @xmath148 y_j = y_{j-1 } - \\theta \\delta \\tau f_j(\\tau_{n-1 } ) v_{n-1}\\ ] ] so @xmath83 can always be chosen small enough to make this step positivity - preserving , if the lhs matrix @xmath149 is an em - matrix .",
    "the latter can be achieved by taking an approach of @xcite , where the first spatial derivatives are discretized by using one - sided finite - differences with the second order of approximation .",
    "same is true for the second sweep of the splitting steps in .",
    "obtaining solutions at the 2 - 4 and 6 - 8 steps for some popular lvy models such as merton , kou , cgmy ( or gtsp ) , nig , general hyperbolic and meixner ones , could be done as it is shown in @xcite .",
    "efficiency of this method in general is not worse than that of the fast fourier transform ( fft ) , and in many cases is linear in @xmath150 - the number of the grid points . in particular , this is the case for the merton , kou , cgmy / gtsp at @xmath151 and meixner models .",

    "we also remind , that according to the method of @xcite the drift term in ( the last one ) could be either moved into the drift term of the corresponding advection - diffusion operator , or could be discretized as @xmath156 this is possible because in both cases in the exponent is the negative of the em - matrix , therefore @xmath157 is a positive matrix with all eigenvalues @xmath158 .",
    "the most difficult step is to solve the problem @xmath159 in @xcite it was demonstrated how to do this when the common jumps are represented by the kou model using a modification of the peaceman - rachford adi method , see @xcite . here",
    "we shortly describe the algorithm for the meixner model .",

    "an obvious solution is @xmath172 . at @xmath173",
    "is a 3d parabolic equation that can be solved using our implicit version of the hv scheme .",
    "indeed , it can be re - written in the form @xmath174v = v(\\tau ) , \\qquad k_n = \\dfrac{a^2}{4 \\pi^2(n-1/2)^2 ( \\dtau)^2}.\\ ] ] as usually @xmath175 is small , e.g. , in @xcite @xmath176 , so even for @xmath166 @xmath177 .",
    "now using the pde approximation theory we can re - write this equation as @xmath178 therefore , if we omit the last term @xmath179 , the total second order approximation of the scheme in time is preserved .",
    "this latter equation is equivalent to @xmath180,\\ ] ] which has to be solved at the time horizon ( maturity ) @xmath181 .",
    "since @xmath182 is small and usually less than @xmath88 we may solve it in one step in time . and",
    "when @xmath165 increases , this conclusion remains to be true as well .",
    "once this solution is obtained we proceed to the next @xmath165 .",
    "thus , this scheme runs in a loop starting with @xmath166 and ending at some @xmath183 .",
    "similar to how we did it for the idiosyncratic jumps we choose @xmath184 based on the argument of @xcite , namely : i ) the high order derivatives of the option price drop down pretty fast in value , and ii ) first 10 terms of the sum @xmath185 approximate the whole sum with the accuracy of 1% .",
    "the solution obtained after @xmath186 steps is the final solution .",
    "overall , the whole splitting algorithm contains 11 steps .",
    "the complexity of each step is linear in @xmath150 since at every step we solve some parabolic equation with a tridiagonal or pentadiagonal matrix .",
    "thus , the total complexity of the method is @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the number of grid nodes in the @xmath189-th dimension , and @xmath190 is some constant coefficient , which is about 276 ( 18 systems for one diffusion step if the implicit modification of the hv scheme is used times 2 diffusion steps , so totally 36 ; 10 systems per a 1d jump step times 2 steps times 3 variables , so totally 60 ; 18 steps per a single 3d parabolic pde solution for common jumps times 10 steps , so totally 180 ) .    still this could be better than a straightforward application of the fft ( in case the fft is applicable , e.g. , the whole characteristic function is known in closed form which is not the case if one takes into account local volatility , etc . ) which usually requires the number of fft nodes to be a power of 2 with a typical value of 2@xmath191 .",
    "it is also better than the traditional approach which considers approximation of the linear non - local jump integral @xmath58 on some grid and then makes use of the fft to compute a matrix - by - vector product . indeed , when using fft for this purpose we need two sweeps per dimension using a slightly extended grid ( with , say , the tension coefficient @xmath192 ) to avoid wrap - around effects , @xcite .",
    "therefore the total complexity per time step could be at least @xmath193 which for the fft grid with @xmath194 , and @xmath195 is 2.5 times slower than our method .",
    "also the traditional approach experiences some other problems for jumps with infinite activity and infinite variation , see survey in @xcite and references therein . also as we have already mentioned using fast gauss transform for the common jump step could significantly reduce the time for this most time - consuming piece of the splitting scheme .",
    "due to the splitting nature of our entire algorithm represented by , each step of splitting is computed using a separate numerical scheme .",
    "all schemes provide second order approximation in both space and time , are unconditionally stable and preserve positivity of the solution .    in our numerical experiments for the steps which include mixed derivatives terms we used the suggested fully implicit version of the hundsdorfer - verwer scheme .",
    "this allows one to eliminate any additional damping scheme of the lower order of approximation , e.g. , implicit euler scheme ( as this is done in the rannacher method ) , or do scheme with the parameter @xmath196 ( as this was suggested in @xcite ) .",
    "a non - uniform finite - difference grid is constructed similar to @xcite in @xmath1 and @xmath2 domains , and as described in @xcite in the @xmath0 domain . in case of barrier options",
    "we extended the @xmath0 grid by adding 2 - 3 ghost points either above the upper barrier or below the lower barrier , or both with the same boundary conditions as at the barrier ( rebate or nothing ) .",

    "in this paper we apply the approach of @xcite for pricing credit derivatives to various option pricing problems ( vanilla and exotic ) where as an underlying model we use local stochastic volatility model with stochastic interest rates and jumps in every stochastic driver .",
    "it is important that all jumps as well as the brownian motions are correlated .",
    "here we solve just the backward problem ( solving the backward kolmogorov equation , e.g. , for pricing derivatives ) , while the forward problem ( solving the forward kolmogorov equation to find the density of the underlying process ) can be treated in a similar way , see @xcite .    in @xcite test examples",
    "were given for the kou and merton models , while the approach is in no way limited by these models .",

    "<S> later @xcite investigated exponential and discrete jumps in both the underlying spot price @xmath0 and the instantaneous variance @xmath1 , and concluded that infrequent negative jumps in the latter are necessary to fit the market data on equity options . </S>",

    "<S> the lsv model is to assume that the short interest rates @xmath2 could be stochastic . under this approach jumps are ignored , but instead a system of three stochastic differential equations ( sde ) with drifts and correlated diffusions is considered , see @xcite and references therein .    </S>",
    "<S> as we have already mentioned , accounting for jumps could be important to calibrate the lsv model to the market data . and making the interest rate stochastic does nt violate this conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , jumps in the interest rate itself could be important . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in @xcite a stochastic volatility model with jumps in both rates and volatility was calibrated to the daily data for futures interest rates in four major currencies which provided a better fit for the empirical distributions . </S>",

    "<S> a class of poisson  gaussian models of the fed funds rate was developed to capture the surprise effects . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that these models offer a good statistical description of a short rate behavior , and are useful in understanding many empirical phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> jump ( poisson ) processes capture empirical features of the data which would not be captured by gaussian models . </S>",
    "<S> also there is strong evidence that the existing gaussian models would be well - enhanced by jump and arch - type processes .    </S>",
    "<S> overall , it would be desirable to have a model where the lsv framework could be combined with stochastic rates and jumps in all three stochastic drivers . </S>",
    "<S> we also want to treat these jumps as general lvy processes , so not limiting us by only the jump - diffusion models . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we consider brownian components to be correlated as well as the jumps in all stochastic drivers to be correlated , while the diffusion and jumps remain uncorrelated . finally , since such a model is hardly analytically tractable when parameters of the model are time - dependent ( which is usually helpful to better calibrate the model to a set of instruments with different maturities , or to a term - structure of some instrument ) , we need an efficient numerical method for pricing and calibration .    for this purpose in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we propose to exploit our approach first elaborated on in @xcite for modeling credit derivatives . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in the former paper we considered a set of banks with mutual interbank liabilities whose assets are driven by correlated lvy processes . </S>",
    "<S> for every asset , the jumps were represented as a weighted sum of the common and idiosyncratic parts . both parts could be simulated by an arbitrary lvy model which is an extension of the previous approaches where either the discrete or exponential jumps were considered , or a lvy copula approach was utilized . </S>",
    "<S> we provided a novel efficient ( linear complexity in each dimension ) numerical ( splitting ) algorithm for solving the corresponding 2d and 3d jump - diffusion equations , and proved its convergence and second order of accuracy in both space and time . </S>",
    "<S> test examples were given for the kou model , while the approach is in no way limited by this model .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we demonstrate how a similar approach can be used together with the metzler model introduced by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is built based on the meixner distribution which belongs to the class of the infinitely divisible distributions . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it gives rise to a lvy process - the meixner process . </S>",
    "<S> the meixner process is flexible and analytically tractable , i.e. its pdf and cf are known in closed form ( in more detail see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> the meixner model is known to be rich and capable to be calibrated to the market data . </S>",
    "<S> again , this model is chosen only as an example , because , in general , the approach in use is rather universal .    </S>",
    "<S> we also propose a new fully implicit modification of the popular hundsdorfer and verwer and modified craig - sneyd finite - difference schemes which provides second order approximation in space and time , is unconditionally stable and preserves positivity of the solution , while still has a linear complexity in the number of grid nodes . </S>",
    "<S> this modification allows elimination of first few rannacher steps as this is usually done in the literature to provide a better stability ( see survey , e.g. , in @xcite ) , and provides much better stability of the whole scheme which is important when solving multidimensional problems .    </S>",
    "<S> the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section </S>",
    "<S> we describe the model . </S>",
    "<S> section  [ solsect ] consists of two subsections . </S>",
    "<S> the first one introduces the new splitting method , which treats mixed derivatives terms implicitly , thus providing a much better stability . </S>",
    "<S> the second subsection describes how to deal with jumps if one uses the meixner model . </S>",
    "<S> however , by no means this approach is restricted just by this model as , e.g. , in @xcite we used the kou jump models using the same treatment of the jump terms . </S>",
    "<S> so here the meixner model is taken as another example . </S>",
    "<S> section  [ numexamp ] presents the results of some numerical experiments where prices of european vanilla and barrier options were computed using these model and numerical method . the final section concludes . </S>"
