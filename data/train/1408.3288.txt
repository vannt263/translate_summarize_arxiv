    "the diffusion process of a particle in a potential with the presence of a sink studied through solution of the smoluchowski equation@xcite is of keen interest to many scientists in chemical dynamics as it serves a reference model for a wide variety of dynamical processes .",
    "various attempts has been made to study the diffusion processes with a suitable position of the sink@xcite which can find application in diffusion controlled reactions@xcite .",
    "such a model is used by wilemski and fixman@xcite to calculate the rate of diffusion controlled reactions as well as cyclization of polymer chain in solutions .",
    "ovchinnikova@xcite , zusman@xcite , marucs and nadler@xcite have used such a model for electron transfer reactions in polar solvents .",
    "marcus@xcite recently used a diffusive equation with a sink term to develop a theory of uni - molecular reactions in clusters .",
    "pressure influence on isomerization reactions is also explained by sumi@xcite by using such type of model.bagchi , fleming@xcite uses a model of this kind to analyze barrier less electron relaxation in solution .",
    "exact analytical results for diffusion problems helps in understanding the different parameters like friction and provide an insight to different approximations . as per the authors knowledge , there are no cases where the smoluchowski equation with a time dependent sink is solved by analytical methods .",
    "even there is no analytical solution available for the simplest possible case _",
    "i.e. , _ for free particle",
    ". there are large number of works on diffusion under time independent sink . in recent work from our group we have given an analytical model in which the problem of particle undergoing diffusive motion under the influence of two potentials where the coupling is time independent@xcite .",
    "most of that has focussed on the time evolution / propagator derivation of the case of one or more dirac delta function sinks with constant strength in time .",
    "in contrast , this paper presents an work that deals mainly with a dirac delta sink whose strength varies with time and we are the first one to consider this effect explicitly .",
    "there are two common methods that one may think of for solving this problem .",
    "one method is using a path integral method of the feynman type and the other is using laplace transforms .",
    "we use the latter method though the two methods are closely related .",
    "our method closely follows the method used for solving schrodinger wave equation .",
    "we would like to solve the smoluchowski equation with a time - dependent sink as shown in figure 1 .",
    "@xmath2    in the above equation @xmath3 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "it is related to the friction coefficient @xmath4 by @xmath5 . by integrating eq .",
    "( 1 ) from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , we find that the eq.(1 ) reduces to .",

    "( 3 ) we first consider the homogeneous solution in order to satisfy the boundary condition at the origin .",
    "the solution is given below @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the integration constant . by applying the boundary condition at the origin to eq .",
    "( 4 ) we find .",

( 6 ) to get @xmath15 the eq.(7 ) may be used to determine the probability distribution at the origin ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath0 ) .",
    "once @xmath0 is known , one may find @xmath1 by inverting eq.(4 ) which has the following result : + @xmath16 eq .",
    "( 7 ) and eq.(8 ) together completely determine the problem . as we can see knowing the probability distribution at the origin _",
    "@xmath17 is essentially equivalent to knowing the probability distribution everywhere ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "in some cases it may be advantageous to write down the solution in terms of propagator as follows @xmath19 where @xmath20 is propagator . to find the propagator , we use eq.(5 ) and eq.(6 ) to get @xmath21 using eq .",

    "we now consider the case , where @xmath28 has the following form : @xmath29 here @xmath30 is a real number .",
    "we take the initial condition as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath30 are real positive numbers . using eq.(6)and the identity @xmath33 = - d l[t\\times f(t)]/ds$ ] ,",
    "we get @xmath34 we can solve this equation under the condition that the laplace transform vanishes at s=@xmath35 and that it must also be bounded at @xmath36 .the last condition is required for the inversion integral to exist . so that we get",
    "@xmath37 this laplace domain expression can not be converted to time domain in terms of elementary or special functions .",
    "however , it can be done using the integral @xmath38 in the above expression @xmath39 is a positive number taken to be larger than the right - most pole in the complex plane .",
    "so we are unable to do the last step analytically , although numerically it is not a problem .",
    "we choose @xmath40 , where @xmath30 is a real positive constant .",
    "the laplace transform of @xmath28 does not exist .",
    "interestingly , the laplace transform of @xmath41 does exist if we choose an initial condition that vanishes at the origin !",
    "our derivation in this subsection is valid under this retriction .",
