    "it has long been a challenge to understand the origins of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "observations and theory both favor `` top - down '' ( instability ) rather than `` bottom - up '' ( coagulation ) mechanisms , at least for the most massive clouds ( @xmath7 ) in which the majority of the molecular material is found and the preponderance of stars are born ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the principal difficulty with stochastic coagulation is that it proceeds much too slowly to achieve gmc masses given other constraints ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; recent support for this view includes the observed lack of raw material in small clouds within spiral arms @xcite , and the conclusion from numerical simulations that magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence can not prevent gravitational collapse within clouds that exceed the magnetic critical mass ] ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the latter result implies that intermediate products of coagulation @xmath8 , if they were created , would undergo rapid star formation and be destroyed by the associated energy feedback before subsequent mergers could attain @xmath9 .",
    "the two main classes of instabilities proposed for gmc formation are parker and self - gravitating modes , and their hybrids ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although the azimuthal wavelengths and initial growth rates of parker modes suggest they could prompt cloud formation in spiral arms ( e.g. , @xcite ) , numerical simulations have recently shown that nonlinear development favors short radial wavelengths and saturates at moderate amplitudes .",

    "direct self - gravitating instabilities have similar preferred azimuthal scales and growth rates to parker modes , but are not self - limiting in the nonlinear regime . in regions _ without _ spiral structure , epicyclic motion can temporarily conspire with shear in the swing amplifier process @xcite to yield gravitational runaway provided a sufficient surface density .",

    "* hereafter paper ii ) have shown that the magneto - jeans instability in spiral arms first leads to growth of gaseous spurs , which then fragment into jeans - scale condensations .",
    "the investigations of cloud formation in papers i - iii considered either two - dimensional or three - dimensional models with zero or strong magnetic fields ( to study parker modes ) . under more realistic galactic conditions with subthermal mean magnetic fields , however , new dynamical effects are introduced by the action of the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) . although the mri has primarily been studied in the context of accretion disks , @xcite proposed that mri and related processes may be important for maintaining turbulence in the outer disks of galaxies where the star formation rate ( and supernova rate ) is low .",
    "the recent calculations of @xcite showing that a cold phase must be present in the far outer milky way support the notion that mri - driven turbulence prevents the settling and gravitational fragmentation of a thin , cold gas layer that would otherwise ensue .    to understand why the mri is likely to be important in galaxies",

    "the detailed dynamical characteristics and consequences of mri - driven turbulence in galaxies have not previously been studied directly .",
    "although the literature contains many theoretical and numerical treatments of mri ( e.g. @xcite , see also @xcite and references therein ) , these works have focused primarily on angular momentum transport in accretion disks around stars and black holes .",
    "these accretion disks differ significantly from galactic disks in that the latter are self - gravitating , have flat rotation curves rather than keplerian rotation , and are more vertically compressed by both gaseous self - gravity and external stellar gravity rather than solely by a tidal stellar potential",
    ". how do the physical properties of a disk affect the level and characteristics of the saturated - state turbulence driven by mri ? how does this turbulence nonlinearly interact with self - gravity to form gmc - like structures in galactic disks ?",
    "in this paper , we address these and related questions by performing and analyzing a suite of three - dimensional mhd simulations .    as in paper iii ,",
    "our disk models are local , isothermal , and vertically stratified .",

    "we also discuss the role played by self - gravity in supplying turbulent energy to the ism . in  3.2 , we present results on @xmath25 thresholds for the formation of gravitationally bound clouds in mri - unstable disks , with comparison to our model results from paper iii .",
    "the properties of the bound clouds formed and the role of magnetic fields in braking their rotational spins is briefly discussed as well .",
    "finally , in  4 we conclude and discuss our findings and related issues within a larger context , noting outstanding questions related to galactic turbulence and gmc formation that will be the focus of future work .",
    "for local , three - dimensional simulations of vertically stratified , mri - unstable , galactic gas disks , we use the same numerical code and model formulation described in paper iii , with the exception that we modify the strength and spatial distribution of the initial magnetic field .",
    "we adopt an isothermal condition in both space and time , with an effective isothermal speed of sound @xmath26 , and solve for an initial vertical density distribution @xmath27 in hydrostatic equilibrium between the thermal pressure gradient and the total ( gaseous plus stellar ) gravity . for the strength of external stellar gravity ,",

    "we take @xmath32 corresponding to @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "note that these values give comparable stellar - disk and gas - disk vertical gravity at @xmath36 , where @xmath37 stands for the gas disk scale height ( paper iii ) .",
    "we introduce an initial uniform magnetic field , @xmath38 , that points in the vertical ( @xmath39 ) direction .",
    "we parameterize its strength using @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the alfvn speed . in the numerical models presented in this paper ,",
    "we adopt @xmath42 or 400 .",
    "the physical value of the initial midplane magnetic field is thus @xmath43 g .",
    "since the density drops off with height , high - latitude regions may have @xmath44 with which the growth of mri is ineffective , but the weak midplane magnetic fields guarantee that the most unstable wavelength of mri is confined within @xmath45 .",
    "note that although the initial magnetic field in our models is primarily vertical ( a numerical expedient that yields rapid growth of mri ) , this condition is not inconsistent with observations of preferentially azimuthal galactic @xmath17-fields , because the saturated - state mri has mainly toroidal @xmath17 , as we shall show in  3.1 . also note that the amplitudes of saturated - state turbulence depend on the net flux for pure-@xmath46 initial @xmath47-fields ( * ? ? ?",

    "other classes of initial magnetic field distributions that have been studied in non - self - gravitating mri simulations ( e.g. , hgb ; @xcite ) contain zero net magnetic flux .",
    "since simulations which begin with zero net flux take much longer to reach saturated turbulence , we have focused on uniform vertical field models in this paper .",
    "further exploration of intermediate field strength and/or orientation may yield interesting results ; we shall , however , defer broader parameter surveys to future investigations .",
    "an important measure of susceptibility to gravitational instability is the toomre @xmath25 parameter @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the epicyclic frequency .",
    "we evolve models with @xmath25 in the range of 1 to 2 to represent various conditions in disk galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "note that the often - cited critical value of @xmath50 applies to axisymmetric instability in an infinitesimally thin disk .",
    "even in unmagnetized cases , finite disk thickness generally reduces the critical @xmath25 value for _ axisymmetric _ instability to @xmath51 for purely self - gravitating disk with @xmath52 @xcite and @xmath53 for a disk with @xmath32 ( paper iii ) .",
    "therefore , our model disks having @xmath54 and @xmath32 are all stable to axisymmetric perturbations .",

    "the basic equations we solve are presented in paper iii .",
    "we use a modified version of the zeus code @xcite with a hybrid green function / fft solver for the poisson equation ( paper iii ) and applying a velocity decomposition method ( paper i ) for less diffusive transport of hydrodynamic variables under strong shear conditions . for improved numerical performance in the low - density `` coronal '' region ,",
    "we employ the alfvn limiter algorithm of @xcite with the limiting speed of the displacement current , @xmath62 .",

    "linear theory predicts that for the parameters in model a , the maximum growth rate of the mri in model a is @xmath89 , which occurs for vertical wavelength @xmath90 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since @xmath91 fits well within a density scale height of the disk ( i.e. , @xmath92 ) , the mri in model a develops similarly to the way it would in a uniform medium . , where @xmath93 is the grid spacing in the @xmath46-direction , means that the fastest growing wavelength is numerically well resolved .",
    "] the predicted maximum growth rate , @xmath94 , marked by the dashed line in figure [ devol]@xmath88 , is indeed in good agreement with the simulation results .",
    "because the fastest growing mode in model a approximates an exact nonlinear solution of the full mhd equations in the incompressible limit @xcite , it can grow to very large amplitude while preserving its essential character .",
    "as the mode grows , the whole flow in model a becomes dominated by this `` channel solution , '' in which fluid elements in alternating horizontal layers that have larger ( smaller ) azimuthal velocity than the background tends to move radially outward ( inward ) .",
    "this inward / outward flow drags the magnetic fields radially in directionally alternating layers , and the sheared azimuthal motion produces corresponding alternating layers of toroidal magnetic field . as the amplitude of @xmath95 becomes large , vertical magnetic pressure gradients compress the disk in alternating layers .",
    "the gas associated with the over - dense regions at @xmath96 in figure [ slice]@xmath97 is streaming radially inward , while the layers surrounding it are moving outward .",
    "after the channel mode grows to very large amplitude , the nonaxisymmetric parasitic instability @xcite develops to break up the flow into smaller - scale turbulence ( fig .",
    "[ slice]_c , d _ ) . direct growth of nonaxisymmetric mri may also contribute to small scale kinetic and magnetic turbulence ( hgb ) . at @xmath98 , the turbulence has achieved a saturated state with large fluctuation amplitudes in all physical variables .    the evolution of averaged disk properties due to the mri is illustrated in figure [ zdist ] , where we plot horizontally - averaged densities , plasma @xmath99 , magnetic and perturbed kinetic energy densities , and maxwell and reynolds stresses of model a at times @xmath100 .",
    "we also list in table [ tbl - a ] the volume and time averages of various physical quantities averaged over @xmath101 .",
    "magnetic fields are amplified to attain levels @xmath102 at mri saturation ( fig .",
    "[ zdist]@xmath97 ) .",
    "the regions above @xmath103 have @xmath104 , consistent with the results of shgb and @xcite that mri in a stratified disk produces a moderately - magnetized disk midplane surrounded by a magnetically - dominated corona .",
    "overall , the magnetic energy density is dominated by the azimuthal component ( @xmath105 ) , and is larger than the perturbed kinetic energy density by a factor of 2 to 7 , with the largest value at late times occurring about a scale height above the midplane ( fig .  [ zdist]@xmath106 ) .",
    "although the kinetic energy density is not more than @xmath107 of the central thermal pressure and the velocity fluctuations are subsonic at the midplane , the magnetic fields are strong enough to drive supersonic motions in the low - density , high - altitude regions .",
    "tables [ tbl - para ] and [ tbl - a ] suggest that in terms of @xcite @xmath108 parameter describing the radial transport of angular momentum , the total dimensionless stress is @xmath109 , with the reynolds stress contributing only @xmath110 of the total ( see also fig .  [ zdist]@xmath111 ) .",
    "this demonstrates that magnetic fields bear primary responsibility for mediating mass accretion in an mri - unstable disk @xcite . during the entire linear and nonlinear evolution , the averaged density profile in @xmath46",
    "is within @xmath112 of the initial distribution , although the amplified magnetic field thickens the disk slightly via its magnetic pressure support ( fig .",
    "[ zdist]@xmath88 ) .    in spite of the kinematic effect of the background shear , the density and magnetic fields are dominated by structure at relatively large spatial scales .",
    "figure [ midvec ] displays the @xmath64-@xmath63 density structure as well as horizontal velocity and magnetic field vectors at the midplane of model a at @xmath113 .",
    "fourier power spectra of the density terms of the density power spectrum that is not associated with turbulent perturbations . ] and the azimuthal component of the magnetic field averaged over @xmath114 in model a are plotted in figure [ power ] .",
    "although the volume - averaged values of @xmath115 and @xmath116 are negligibly small ( see table [ tbl - a ] ) , a constant-@xmath46 plane consists of a few magnetic domains in which @xmath115 and @xmath116 are distributed coherently ; across the domains , the horizontal magnetic field reverses direction .",
    "for example , the right panel of figure [ midvec ] shows that the midplane is dominated by negative-@xmath115 and positive-@xmath116 : the midplane mean values of @xmath115 and @xmath116 are @xmath117 and @xmath118 times @xmath119 at @xmath113 , respectively .",
    "given these large mean values of @xmath120 and @xmath121 in any layer at constant @xmath46 , the magnetic field has to bend and reverse in the vertical direction in order to yield the small net volume averages of table [ tbl - a ] ( _ first three rows , second column _ ) .",
    "this field geometry is indeed consistent with figure [ power]@xmath97 , which shows that the maximum power of @xmath116 is attained in the @xmath122 , @xmath123 mode ; the @xmath124 , @xmath125 mode is also strong . here ,",
    "integers @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 denote the wavenumber in each direction .",
    "the dominant mode for @xmath116 at late times is thus still that associated with channel flow .",
    "the @xmath116 mode with next most power is coherent in the @xmath63 ( azimuthal ) direction and has a single reversal in the @xmath46 and @xmath64 ( radial ) directions .",
    "despite the fact that our model disk has lower shear and is more tightly vertically compressed than the models considered by hgb and shgb , the characteristics of turbulence observed in the power spectra are similar . among the similarities",
    "are ( 1 ) most of power is contained in modes with scales comparable to or larger than the disk scale height , ( 2 ) the turbulence is highly anisotropic , as the different slopes of the power spectra along the different axes implies , and ( 3 ) at well - resolved scales , the logarithmic slopes of the power spectra are similar to the @xmath129 kolmogorov spectrum ( see hgb ; shgb ) .",
    "the kinetic - to - magnetic scaling ratios in our models are also similar to those in hgb .",
    "for instance , for a nonstratified model ( z4 ) with uniform magnetic fields , hgb found @xmath130 and @xmath131 , which are very similar to @xmath132 and @xmath133 in models a and b of this paper ( see table [ tbl - para ] ) .",
    "the level of the turbulent fluctuations is , of course , dependent on the field strength and geometry , and possibly on other disk parameters .",
    "having uniform vertical magnetic fields , model a exhibits stronger growth of mri than a zero - net-@xmath86 model ( iz1 ) of shgb .",
    "table [ tbl - a ] shows that model a experiences fluctuations in the density with @xmath134 and in the total pressure with @xmath135 , which are about an order of magnitude larger than in model iz1 of shgb . comparing to the uniform-@xmath86 model z4 of hgb",
    ", however , model a shows smaller turbulent fluctuation amplitudes .",
    "this is because the density stratification of model a makes high-@xmath46 fields effectively stronger ( in terms of @xmath99 ) , resulting in local mri wavelengths at high latitudes that are larger than the vertical size of box . as a consequence ,",
    "the resulting @xmath108 in model a ( which averages over both high - stress and low - stress volumes ) is about a half of @xmath136 in model z4 of hgb .    in practice , the vertical magnetic field",
    "will always be correlated in sign on some largest radial scale , and the extent of this correlated region  as well as the magnitude of the vertical magnetic flux over this scale  will affect the amplitudes of saturated - state turbulence . even over short evolutionary times compared to the galactic lifetime ,",
    "our models show growth in the @xmath137 , @xmath124 , @xmath138 component of the @xmath86 power spectrum , corresponding to correlated vertical magnetic field over radial scales comparable to the thickness of the disk .",
    "although realistic values for the correlation scale and magnitude of @xmath86 are not known at present , this evidence of `` dynamo '' activity helps to motivate our incorporation of vertical flux in the initial conditions .",
    "while there are not yet predictions from simulations of the level of vertical magnetic fields that would develop over long timescales , one may speculate that vertical field would build up to values similar to those we adopt , since for much weaker vertical fields the fastest - growing mri modes are at very small scales , and for much stronger vertical fields the mri is stabilized ( see also  4 ) .",
    "radio observers of external face - on galaxies report line widths of order @xmath139 in extended regions of disks where no active star formation takes place @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that in the absence of stellar energy inputs , the mri may be important in producing large - scale random motions in these extended disks . a direct way to assess this specific proposal , and more generally to investigate the role of the mri in driving galactic turbulence , is to measure the turbulent velocity dispersions from numerical simulations .",
    "although the current models are idealized in ways that may significantly affect the results , it is useful to quantify the turbulence level for future comparisons . as table [ tbl - para ]",
    "lists , the density - weighted one - dimensional velocity dispersions in the non - self - gravitating model a are found to be @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 . in dimensional units ,",
    "these correspond only to @xmath143 , much smaller than the observed line widths cited above ( which however are not purely turbulent  see  4.1 ) .",
    "the velocity dispersions are smallest in the vertical direction , indicating that buoyancy does not appreciably enhance turbulence .",
    "model z4 of hgb reports @xmath144 and @xmath145 , so that the density stratification has little effect on the velocity dispersion .",
    "finally , we compare the evolution of our disk models with @xcite , who performed stratified disk models with @xmath146 . in their simulation with a pure @xmath86 field ,",
    "strong axisymmetric channel flows quickly emerge and rise buoyantly , disrupting the initial disk structure .",
    "the system becomes magnetically dominated everywhere at the end of the run .",
    "as figure [ zdist ] shows , however , our model a keeps its initial disk structure fairly intact even when the disk is highly turbulent .",
    "high - density parts of the disk in model a have subthermal magnetic fields at saturation rather than becoming magnetically dominated . in part",
    ", these differences may be due to the differences between the circumstellar - disk tidal gravity law @xmath147 and the stronger vertical gravity provided by the gaseous and stellar disks in a galaxy . within a scale height of the midplane , the galactic gravity is a factor @xmath148 larger for the present models compared to @xmath147 .",
    "this compresses the disk more tightly in the vertical direction , making the buoyant rise associated with the channel solution less efficient . with an initial field strength having @xmath149 and a shear parameter @xmath146",
    ", mri - amplified channel - flow magnetic fields in @xcite are also much stronger than those in the present models , contributing to the destruction of the initial disk structure .",
    "we now turn to models f and g , which have self - gravity included in their dynamical evolution but have surface densities below the ( nonlinear ) gravitational instability threshold .",
    "thus , self - gravity in models f and g , with @xmath150 and @xmath151 , respectively , is not strong enough to engender formation of bound condensations , although it certainly enhances the fluctuation amplitudes of physical variables .",
    "table [ tbl - f ] lists the volume and time averaged quantities ( over @xmath152 ) in model f. the fluctuations in the perturbed density and total pressure , with @xmath153 and @xmath154 , are quite similar in amplitudes to those in model a , but magnetic and perturbed kinetic energy densities in model f are increased by about 60% .",
    "note , however , that the ratios @xmath155 and @xmath156 are almost independent of the presence of self - gravity ( table [ tbl - para ] ) , indicating that self - gravity , as well as the disk compression and shear parameter , does not change the angular - momentum - transport characteristics of mri - driven turbulence significantly .",
    "to gain some idea on the origin of the extra turbulent energy in the ( weakly ) self - gravitating model f , we have analyzed for comparison the data of the hydrodynamic ( i.e. unmagnetized ) model c ( with @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 ) of paper iii .",
    "the density - weighted velocity dispersions , averaged over @xmath160 , are found to be @xmath161 , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 , which happen to be similar to @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and @xmath166 , the differences in the velocity dispersions between the mri - unstable models f and a. note that the turbulence in model c of paper iii is driven purely by hydrodynamic swing amplification ( perhaps augmented by buoyancy effects ) .",
    "although it is not obvious how turbulent energies of different physical origins in general ought to combine to reach a total turbulent amplitude , these results suggest that motions driven by self - gravity _ in a single - phase medium _ can contribute only @xmath167 of the amplitude of the velocity fluctuations that mri can drive .",
    "therefore , self - gravity _ alone _ is unlikely to be a significant source of turbulence in galactic disks with @xmath168 .",
    "disks with smaller @xmath25 become gravitationally unstable , as we shall show below .",
    "we now consider the formation of self - gravitating clouds in turbulent galactic gas disk models .",
    "as mentioned before , we slowly turn on self - gravity at @xmath75 , after mri saturation .",
    "this slow inclusion of self - gravity prevents an abrupt response to the gravitational potential and enables us to explore the nonlinear interaction of self - gravity with fully - developed turbulence .",
    "as figure [ devol ] shows , models c - e with @xmath169 achieve high enough density to produce self - gravitating runaway , while other models with @xmath170 remain stable ( with large fluctuations in density ) . from careful examinations of density power spectra at successive times , we identify the mechanism of self - gravitating cloud formation in models c - e with swing amplification of high - amplitude density perturbations . as discussed in the previous subsection , the power spectra of mri - driven turbulence peak at small wavenumbers , so that the corresponding large spatial scale density perturbations can be easily swing - amplified if self - gravity is sufficient .",
    "figure [ q10col ] shows surface density snapshots at @xmath171=4.5 , 5.0 , and 5.5 of model c ( with @xmath172 ) . in the left frame ,",
    "the maximum power in the surface density is in a trailing @xmath173 mode , but there is also considerable power in a leading mode with @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "the swing amplifier causes the leading mode to accumulate more mass as it shears into trailing configuration .",
    "the net result is the formation of high density filaments ( middle frame ) , which collide with each other and then fragment to form three bound condensations ( right frame ) . at their initial formation ,",
    "the clumps have mass @xmath176 each ( see eq .",
    "[ [ mj2d ] ] ) ; they subsequently accrete additional material from their surroundings . at the end of the simulation ( @xmath171=5.5 ) ,",
    "the mass contained in the three clumps is @xmath177 of the total mass , corresponding to each clump of mass @xmath178 .    because of its weaker self - gravity , model d with @xmath179 and @xmath42 requires two major swing amplification events before its eventual gravitational runaway occurs .",
    "in particular , intermediate - density filaments ( from the first swing amplification ) have @xmath180 at @xmath181 , but these fail to initiate gravitational collapse .",
    "although most of power at this point is in the form of trailing waves , nonlinear interactions of sheared large - amplitude wavelets are vigorous , especially given the stresses from highly turbulent magnetic fields , which ends up supplying fresh small-@xmath182 modes ( paper i ) .",
    "another phase of swing amplification follows , this time yielding sufficient enhancement of density to trigger gravitational runaway .",
    "model d forms a bound clump with @xmath183 at the end of the run .",
    "the evolution of model e with @xmath179 and @xmath184 is quite similar to that of model d , but the lower - amplitude saturated state of mri when the mean magnetic field is weaker causes the formation of a bound cloud to take longer .    the self - gravitating clouds that form in our simulations turn out all to be magnetically supercritical .",
    "for instance , the mass - to - flux ratio of the cloud marked by a square in the left frame of figure [ q10col ] is @xmath185 at @xmath186 when it first appears , and increases to @xmath187 at @xmath188 , well above the critical value of @xmath189 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . here",
    ", @xmath190 denotes the magnetic flux that passes through the cloud and @xmath191 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the other bound clouds also have mass - to - flux ratios in the similar range , that is , @xmath192 , with higher values corresponding to more - evolved , more - massive clouds .",
    "note that the lower limit of this range is remarkably similar to @xmath193 of a square region projected in the @xmath194 plane that contains one jeans mass in the saturated - mri disk with the mean @xmath195 g .",
    "this suggests that the bound clouds initially form by collecting material relatively isotropically in a way that preserves the magnetic flux fairly well .",
    "as the clouds become sufficiently self - gravitating , they begin to collapse and accrete more gas in all three dimensions , perhaps with accretion along the mean field direction enhancing the mass - to - flux ratio at later time .",
    "although hard to quantify with our present limited resolution , magnetic reconnection occurring inside the clouds may also contribute to high mass - to - flux ratios .    as figure [ devol ] clearly illustrates , the threshold for nonlinear gravitational instability in our mri - driven turbulent galactic disk models is in the range @xmath196 $ ] .",
    "this threshold @xmath197 is higher than found for either completely unmagnetized ( @xmath198 ) or thermal - equipartition - magnetized ( @xmath199 ) 3d disk models in paper iii . when bound clouds formed in those models , they had masses of two to several @xmath200 , similar to the present results .",
    "we note that in our previous simulations _ without _ large - amplitude turbulence , any model with density fluctuations as large as those in model f ( see table [ tbl - f ] ) ended in gravitational runaway . here , however , the same turbulence that creates overdense regions can also destroy them , such that model f is nonlinearly gravitationally stable .",
    "the mri - driven turbulent disks have higher @xmath197 than the models of paper iii partly because the turbulence produces large - amplitude , large - scale perturbations in the surface density ( see tables [ tbl - a],[tbl - f ] ) that reduce the effective value of @xmath25 by @xmath201 .",
    "in addition , torques from small - scale magnetic fields can drive radial angular momentum and mass transport , much as occurs from the mri in accretion disk models .",
    "since vorticity conservation of fluid elements is the chief barrier to gravitational instability at large enough scales in rotating disks , radial transfer of angular momentum within / across an overdense region can contribute to enabling runaway condensation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a longstanding astronomical issue of great interest is how the total angular momentum of a self - gravitating cloud evolves as it condenses out of the diffuse ism .",
    "the prevailing idea is that magnetic fields linking a cloud with the surrounding medium exert back - torques as it spins up during contraction , leading to loss of angular momentum ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "most previous work on this `` magnetic braking '' process has focused on the problem of an ideal cloud anchored to the ambient medium with a prescribed magnetic field distribution , solving to obtain the temporal evolution of the angular velocity . using our three - dimensional simulation data from both the present models and those from paper iii , we will demonstrate directly in this subsection that a cloud that condenses out of a rotating , magnetized disk can shed significant angular momentum via magnetic braking during the cloud - forming phase .    to describe the rotational properties of a self - gravitating cloud , we consider the volume bounded by an isodensity surface @xmath202 .",
    "we define the total angular momentum and the total mass of a volume with @xmath203 as @xmath204 @xmath205 respectively , where the coordinates ( @xmath64 , @xmath63 , @xmath46 ) and the inplane velocity ( @xmath206 , @xmath207 ) are measured relative to the center of the condensation .",
    "one may then calculate the mean specific angular momentum @xmath208 as a function of @xmath209 . because model disks from which bound clouds originate may have different specific angular momenta initially ,",
    "it is useful to compare @xmath210 of a cloud with @xmath211 , the total specific angular momentum that the cloud would have if it did not lose any angular momentum during its formation . for a region of uniform surface density",

    "thus , in the case of a flat rotation curve @xmath61 , @xmath214 for a square patch of side @xmath215 in the unperturbed disk . for purposes of comparison , we shall take @xmath215 such that the total mass is the same as that within the @xmath216 surface for the bound cloud that forms .",
    "exemplary profiles of @xmath217 for three bound clouds at a few selected times are shown in figure [ angmom ] . in the figure ,",
    "`` mri '' refers to a cloud that forms within the region marked by a square in the figure [ q10col ] snapshot of model c ( @xmath218 ) of this paper , while the curves with `` parker '' and `` swing '' correspond to clouds formed in magnetized model d ( @xmath219 ) and unmagnetized model c ( @xmath220 ) of paper iii , respectively .",
    "it is apparent that magnetized clouds ( `` mri '' and `` parker '' ) lower their specific angular momentum over time as they gravitationally contract , while @xmath210 of an unmagnetized cloud ( `` swing '' ) fluctuates around @xmath221 .",
    "this implies , consistent with expectations , that magnetic fields play a key role in removing angular momentum . although the resolution of the present simulations is not sufficient to follow this process over long periods , the characteristic angular momentum loss time during the interval measured is @xmath222 for the magnetized models .",
    "since bound clouds typically form within @xmath223 ( see fig .   [ devol ] ) , the similarity of timescales suggests that magnetic braking is quite efficient , possibly enough to explain the very low observed specific angular momenta of gmcs ( e.g. , @xcite ) compared to their corresponding @xmath211 values .    to help visualize the magnetic braking process that occurs in our simulations",
    ", we show in figure [ 3dvol ] a volumetric rendering of an isodensity surface and magnetic field lines , as well as the density and velocity field at the midplane , for a dense clump in model c at @xmath188 .",
    "the midplane velocity vectors show that the cloud is counter - rotating with respect to the the sense of the background shear , with the principal rotation axis parallel to the @xmath46-direction ( this sense of spin is prograde with respect to galactic rotation ) .",
    "the magnetic field lines show rather complex behavior .",
    "some field lines ( black ) at mid - latitude regions loop back to the cloud , while other field lines anchor the cloud to the ambient medium .",
    "field lines drawn in green start running from the right edge of the box , swirl into the cloud in the counterclockwise direction , and reemerge to swirl in the clockwise direction out to the left edge of the box .",
    "these field lines exert net torques on the cloud surface . on the other hand , field lines drawn in blue that touch the ceiling of the box are relatively straight .",
    "the fact that the horizontal field lines are more twisted than the vertical field lines suggests that magnetic fields _ perpendicular _ to the spin axis provide most of the braking .",
    "although the periodic @xmath46-boundary conditions we have adopted tend to reduce vertical torsion , an important physical consideration is that there is larger inertia of ambient gas in the horizontal direction ( e.g. , @xcite ) , tending to promote large horizontal torsion .",
    "finally , we remark that limited resolution in the current simulations may affect the measured estimate of angular momentum loss . with higher - resolution simulations",
    "( employing adaptive or nested meshes ) , it will be possible to make a more quantitative assessment of how effective magnetic braking is in removing a cloud s initial angular momentum .",
    "understanding the origins of gmcs is key to characterizing star formation on a galactic scale , because the rate and mode of star formation are linked to the rate of cloud formation and the physical properties of gmcs at birth .",
    "many different galactic - scale processes may affect gmc formation . in this paper , we use 3d mhd simulations to initiate investigation of mri - driven turbulence in disk galaxies and its role in prompting cloud - forming gravitational instabilities .",

[ [ beta ] ] ) . for simplicity , we have adopted an isothermal equation of state with sound speed @xmath0 ; the corresponding temperature is characteristic of the warm ism .",
    "we evolve disk models of varying surface density parameterized by the toomre stability parameter @xmath25 ( see eq .",

    "we explore the nonlinear saturation of mri and the growth and evolution of self - gravitating structures .",
    "in particular , we analyze statistical properties of the turbulence , assess the threshold for gravitational instability , and measure the masses and angular momenta of the bound clouds that form . where appropriate ,",
    "for comparison we also analyze the data from some models from paper iii .",
    "in  3.1 we investigate the characteristics of turbulence initiated and sustained by mri in non- or weakly self - gravitating models . despite the differences in the shear parameter , degree of vertical disk compression , and the presence of self - gravity , the statistical properties of the turbulence in our stratified disks are remarkably similar to those in the nonstratified `` accretion disk '' simulations of hgb .",
    "our models yield saturated - state shakura & sunyaev dimensionless @xmath226 stress parameter @xmath227 , ratio of the reynolds to maxwell stresses @xmath228 , and ratio of the total stress to magnetic energy density @xmath229 ( see table [ tbl - para ] ) .",

    "we find density - weighted velocity dispersions in models with @xmath42 are @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with the mean plasma parameter @xmath234 at saturation . with @xmath231 and @xmath235 g @xmath236",
    ", this implies that mri in the present models produces turbulent levels up to @xmath237 and @xmath238 , and rms magnetic field strength @xmath239 g .",
    "these magnetic field strengths are similar to estimates in the milky may and in external galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the velocity dispersions are significantly lower than the observed line widths of @xmath240 and @xmath241 , respectively , for the cold and warm components in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. , @xcite ) . since the thermal linewidth from cold gas is negligible and that from the warm gas ( in the stable regime ) is @xmath240 , the warm and cold phases both have turbulent velocity dispersions @xmath242 , significantly larger than the turbulence levels in the present models .",
    "for the extended disks of face - on galaxies , radio observations of emission linewidths imply @xmath243 ( e.g. , @xcite ) for the atomic gas ; in the absence of absorption measurements , it is not directly possible to distinguish the turbulent and thermal contributions ( or the proportions of warm / cold gas ) .",

    "because the level of the velocity fluctuations depends on the mean magnetic flux , one might argue that we could have obtained larger @xmath256 s , had we adopted larger initial vertical @xmath47-fields .",
    "hgb found , for example , that the saturation magnetic energy density is linearly proportional to @xmath91 and thus to the mean value @xmath257 , or @xmath258 .",
    "if the mri in a single - phase medium is to produce @xmath251 up to the observational values , these scalings would imply that the vertical magnetic field should have @xmath259 ( assuming that the magnetic and perturbed kinetic energy densities at saturation are also linearly proportional ) .",
    "equation ( [ lamax ] ) would then require @xmath260 pc for the vertical wavelength of mri ; if this is larger than the thickness of the disk , the saturation energy density would have to be reduced accordingly .",
    "even if larger mean vertical fields were able to produce larger velocity dispersions , the implied total magnetic energy densities would exceed observed values in disk galaxies . given these constraints ,",
    "we conclude that mri acting in a _ single - phase _ medium could not generate the level of turbulence implied by line width measurements .",
    "it is unknown  but of great interest ",
    "whether mri processes acting in a much less uniform , multi - phase disk could yield appreciably larger velocity dispersions .",
    "one might expect , for example , a larger velocity dispersion for a given mri driving rate if larger effective mean free paths for dissipative interactions in a cloudy medium ( compared to a single - phase medium ) reduces the turbulent decay rate .",
    "even if the mri angular momentum transport rate  proportional in steady state to the energy dissipation rate per unit mass @xmath261  increased by a factor @xmath262 for a factor @xmath263 increase in @xmath245 compared to the above , the accretion time ( @xmath264 ) is still comparable to the hubble time .",
    "this timescale for inflow is long enough to allay the historical concern of overrapid accretion if turbulence taps the orbital energy of the ism in a galaxy ( cf .",
    "in addition , the implied volume heating rate would also still be well within the limits set by emission from the diffuse ism @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations will be required to decide whether mri - driven turbulence in a multi - phase medium is competitive with the conventional turbulent energy source for the ism , supernova shocks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "initial work towards this goal is already underway @xcite .",
    "realistic theoretical assessment of the contributing turbulent driving processes may ultimately require simultaneous modeling , since the dynamical effects are not necessarily independent .",
    "our three - dimensional simulations show that the enhancement in the amplitudes of velocity fluctuations by the presence of self - gravity is so small ( less than 30% ) that self - gravity _ alone _ is unlikely to be a major source of galactic turbulence for a single - phase disk .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite using two - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations argued that self - gravity can extract sufficient turbulent energy from large - scale galactic rotation to maintain the observed level of turbulence in the ism .",
    "their conclusion is based on the development of a turbulent velocity field with @xmath265 in thermally and gravitationally unstable flows . at the point a quasi - steady state is reached in the wada et al .",
    "models , most of the gas ( @xmath266 ) is contained in cold ( @xmath267k ) clouds occupying @xmath268 of the disk area .",
    "thus , the cloudy medium resembles a disk of collisionless particles which has kinetically heated itself through large - scale gravitational instabilities until the typical dispersion in random velocities @xmath269 is sufficient to render @xmath270 .",
    "these sorts of models are likely appropriate for the ism in galactic center regions ( often dominated by molecular gas ) rather than for the ism in the main and outer disk , where surface densities are an order of magnitude lower than those considered by wada et al . , and where observations indicate that a much smaller proportion of the gas is in cold , dense clouds .    in an application to ngc 2915",
    ", @xcite also presented a 2d model that extends up to @xmath271 kpc .",
    "they found that rapid cooling of gas makes even very low surface - density disks highly susceptible to thermal and gravitational instability that produces a cloudy medium with @xmath272 .",
    "combined together with our finding that turbulence driven by self - gravity is not significant as long as the disks are weakly self - gravitating ( with @xmath168 ) and remain isothermal , this suggests that the dynamical importance of self - gravity may depend strongly on the effective filling factor of the gas .",
    "it is therefore essential to run 3d models with a range of properties to determine how the amplitudes of turbulence from self - gravitational driving scale with the relative proportions of cold , dense , and warm ( or hot ) diffuse gas .",
    "these proportions of gas in different phases can not be tuned directly since turbulence itself can affect the ratio of dense to diffuse gas , via collisional shock heating and other related processes .      in  3.2 , we study directly the nonlinear interaction of mri - driven turbulence with self - gravity , showing that jeans - mass - scale bound condensations form provided that the mean gas surface density is sufficiently high . in terms of the toomre parameter",
    ", the nonlinear instability condition is @xmath273 .",
    "the route to cloud formation is swing amplification of nonlinear density fluctuations ( @xmath274 ) over large spatial scales ( @xmath275 ) that arise as a consequence of the mri .- values as large as 1.5 .",
    "however , it is not yet clear whether other mechanisms can produce density enhancements over the required @xmath276 spatial scales . ]",
    "compared to our previous 3d models of unmagnetized or strongly - magnetized ( @xmath277 ) disks which yielded @xmath11 ( paper iii ) , the mri - unstable disks have larger @xmath197 .",
    "this higher @xmath197 may partly be because self - gravity is initially strong in the large - amplitude density fluctuations driven by turbulence , enhancing the effectiveness of the swing amplifier ; the higher @xmath197 may also owe in part to the ability of small - scale magnetic fields to transfer angular momentum between over- and under - dense regions locally .",
    "the @xmath25 threshold we find is similar to the empirical result @xmath278 obtained by @xcite based on azimuthally - averaged gas surface densities in a large sample of galaxies .",
    "although intriguing , we caution that this close coincidence may be particular to the details of the current models ( e.g. the net poloidal magnetic flux , the phase state of the gaseous medium )",
    ". nevertheless , we consider it a significant success that theory and observation have arrived at essentially the same simple criterion for the onset of active star formation in galactic disks .",
    "gravitationally bound clouds that form in our simulations are all magnetically supercritical with the mass - to - flux ratio of @xmath279 and have typical masses of a few @xmath280 each , corresponding roughly to the two - dimensional jeans mass at the mean surface density .",
    "these clouds have masses consistent with the largest atomic or molecular clouds found in disk galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". the molecular components of the largest milky way gmcs are nearly an order of magnitude lower in mass . the added contribution from , which increases total masses of milky way gmcs by at least a factor of two @xcite , reaching @xmath281 in some cases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , accounts for some of the disparity between our present results and observed molecular clouds .",
    "in addition , the disparity may owe in part to expected differences between cloud masses in systems with and without strong spiral structure , as discussed below .",
    "table [ tbl - sum ] summarizes the model prescription / parameters and main results for bound cloud formation from papers i - iii and the present work .",
    "as table [ tbl - sum ] indicates , our simulations so far have considered both disk models without features in the background gravitational potential ( paper i in 2d ; paper iii and this work in 3d ) , and disk models that include a background ( stellar ) spiral potential ( paper ii in 2d ) .",
    "all of our models to date are local .",
    "although restricted to the 2d razor - thin limit , paper ii demonstrated that when spiral structure is present , gravitational instabilities ( in particular , the mji ) form clouds preferentially in spiral arm regions , consistent with the observations that the warmest , most massive gmcs in the milky way are strongly correlated with spiral structure ( e.g. , @xcite ) . while the mean gaseous surface densities for models that formed clouds in paper i ( without spiral structure ) and paper ii ( with spiral structure ) were similar , the resulting cloud masses in paper ii were smaller by a factor @xmath282 .",
    "this difference owes to the overall compression of diffuse gas in spiral arms , which reduces the jeans mass @xmath283 ; the mass collection zone is also limited by the width of the spiral arm itself .    for a given gaseous surface density ,",
    "cloud masses are also affected by the thickness of the disk , since increasing the thickness dilutes self - gravity , typically increasing the in - plane jeans length by a factor @xmath284 . with weaker self - gravity",
    ", a larger total area / mass is needed to prompt instability .",
    "thus , the 3d models of paper iii produced larger cloud masses at given surface density ( i.e. @xmath25 value ) than would have been predicted on the basis of the 2d models of paper i ( although since instability was present only for smaller @xmath25 in 3d than in 2d , the resulting cloud masses in papers i , iii were similar ) .",
    "real galactic disks of course have finite thickness and are turbulent , and in this sense the current models supersede the `` swing '' models of papers i and iii .",
    "however , real galaxies also in general contain stellar spiral structure , which paper ii implemented only in 2d .",
    "finite thickness effects are expected to increase the cloud spacings and masses that form by mji in spiral arms compared to the results of paper ii .",
    "although this could imply up to a factor @xmath285 increase in cloud masses at a given surface density , turbulence could limit this increase somewhat .",
    "three - dimensional simulations with explicit modeling of spiral potential perturbations and vertical density stratification are required to address this and related questions directly , although our net expectations from effects currently studied suggest total cloud masses in the neighborhood of @xmath280 .    because observed gmcs have very small specific angular momenta @xcite compared to galactic values ( see eq .",
    "[ [ jgal ] ] ) on comparable mass scales , it is of much interest to determine when and how this angular momentum is lost . using our models",
    ", we explicitly demonstrate that a self - gravitating , contracting , magnetized cloud loses specific angular momentum via surface torques imposed by the large - scale galactic magnetic fields that thread it .",
    "this magnetic braking is predominantly from horizontal @xmath47-fields ( perpendicular to the spin axis of the cloud ) that connect the cloud to the dense portion of the galactic disk .",
    "our preliminary estimates suggest that the rate of angular momentum loss is sufficient to explain observations of low gmc spins , although higher - resolution simulations will be needed to confirm this result .    finally",
    ", we remark on the mass spectrum of galactic molecular clouds , generally described from co observations as a power - law @xmath286 below a cutoff of a few @xmath287 ( e.g. , @xcite ) ( with envelopes increasing individual cloud masses by factors of @xmath288 ) . the gravitational instability scenario of this work and papers i - iii explains the upper cutoff in terms of the jeans mass , as noted above ( see also e.g. @xcite ) . below this cutoff",
    ", the mass spectrum may mainly reflect the effects of turbulent dynamics _ within _ massive ( jeans - scale ) clouds as they form and subsequently disperse .",
    "recent analysis of simulated models of turbulent gmcs has shown that a power - law spectrum of moderate - density clumps develops @xcite ; the index measured is the same as the observed galactic cloud spectrum .",
    "if the processes that disperse a gmc preserve the mass spectrum of former clumps as isolated clouds , and/or if observational identification methods decompose some large gmcs into their sub - parts , then similar clump and cloud mass spectra are a natural consequence of `` top - down '' gmc formation .",

    "<S> giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , where most stars form , may originate from self - gravitating instabilities in the interstellar medium . using local three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations , we investigate ways in which galactic turbulence associated with the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) may influence the formation and properties of these massive , self - gravitating clouds . </S>",
    "<S> our disk models are vertically stratified with both gaseous and stellar gravity , and subject to uniform shear corresponding to a flat rotation curve . </S>",
    "<S> initial magnetic fields are assumed to be weak and purely vertical . for simplicity , we adopt an isothermal equation of state with sound speed @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that mri - driven turbulence develops rapidly , with the saturated - state shakura & sunyaev parameter @xmath1 dominated by maxwell stresses . </S>",
    "<S> many of the dimensionless characteristics of the turbulence ( e.g. the ratio of the maxwell to reynolds stresses ) are similar to results from previous mri studies of accretion disks , hence insensitive to the degree of vertical disk compression , shear rate , and the presence of self - gravity  although self - gravity enhances fluctuation amplitudes slightly . </S>",
    "<S> the density - weighted velocity dispersions in non- or weakly self - gravitating disks are @xmath2 and @xmath3 , suggesting that mri can contribute significantly to the observed level of galactic turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> the saturated - state magnetic field strength @xmath4 g is similar to typical galactic values . </S>",
    "<S> when self - gravity is strong enough , mri - driven high - amplitude density perturbations are swing - amplified to form jeans - mass ( @xmath5 ) bound clouds . </S>",
    "<S> compared to previous unmagnetized or strongly - magnetized disk models , the threshold for nonlinear instability in the present models occurs for surface densities at least 50% lower , corresponding to the toomre parameter @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we present evidence that self - gravitating clouds like gmcs formed under conditions similar to our models can lose much of their original spin angular momenta by magnetic braking , preferentially via fields threading near - perpendicularly to their spin axes . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the present results within the larger theoretical and observational context , outlining directions for future study . </S>"
