    "then there exists @xmath691 such that @xmath695 and @xmath696 these equations also hold if we use weyl quantisation instead of the standard one .",
    "moreover , if @xmath697 , then we can replace @xmath698 by @xmath699 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : elliptic ] is similar to the analogous statement for the standard calculus .",
    "however , in this setting we express everything in powers of @xmath99 .",
    "if @xmath652 is bounded away from zero , then we may define @xmath700 by its symbol @xmath701 .",

    "an immediate consequence of theorem [ thm : sclp ] is that if @xmath106 is a family of localised functions then ( as we may locally teat @xmath624 as @xmath630 ) @xmath714 for @xmath108 .",
