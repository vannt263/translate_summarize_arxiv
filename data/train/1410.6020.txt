    "branching processes have been applied widely to model epidemic spread ( see , e.g. , the monographs by andersson and britton @xcite , daley and gani @xcite and mode and sleeman @xcite , and the review by pakes @xcite ) .",
    "the process describing the number of infectious individuals in an epidemic model may be well approximated by a branching process if the population is homogeneously mixing and the number of infectious individuals is small in relation to the total size of the susceptible population , since under these circumstances the probability that an infectious contact is with a previously infected individual is negligible ( see , e.g. , isham @xcite ) .",
    "such an approximation dates back to the pioneering works of bartlett @xcite and kendall @xcite , and can be made mathematically precise by showing convergence of the epidemic process to a limiting branching process as the number of susceptibles tends to infinity ( see ball @xcite , ball and donnelly @xcite and metz @xcite ) .",
    "the approximation may also be extended to epidemics in populations that are not homogeneously mixing , for example , those containing small mixing units such as households and workplaces ( see pellis _",
    "@xcite ) .    before proceeding we give outline descriptions of some common branching process models ( see , e.g. , jagers @xcite for further details ) , which describe the evolution of a single - type population . in all of these models ,",
    "individuals have independent and identically distributed reproduction processes . in a bienaym  galton ",
    "watson branching process , each individual lives for one unit of time and then has a random number of children , distributed according to a random variable , @xmath0 say . in a bellman ",
    "harris branching process ( bhbp ) , each individual lives until a random age , distributed according to a random variable @xmath1 say , and then has a random number of children , distributed according to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath0 are independent .",
    "the sevastyanov branching process ( sbp ) is defined similarly , except @xmath1 and @xmath0 may be dependent , so the number of children an individual has is correlated with that individual s lifetime .",
    "finally , in a general branching process , also called a crump  mode  jagers ( cmj ) branching process , each individual lives until a random age , distributed according to @xmath1 , and reproduces at ages according to a point process @xmath2 . more precisely , if an individual , @xmath3 say having reproduction variables @xmath4 , is born at time @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the points of @xmath7 , then individual @xmath3 has one child at each of times @xmath8 .",
    "this paper is primarily concerned with models for epidemics of diseases , such as measles , mumps and avian influenza , which follow the so - called sir ( susceptible @xmath9 infective @xmath9 removed ) scheme in a closed , homogeneously mixing population or some of its extensions .",
    "a key epidemiological parameter for such an epidemic model is the basic reproduction number @xmath10 ( see heesterbeek and dietz @xcite ) , which in the present setting is given by the mean of the offspring distribution of the approximating branching process .",
    "in particular a major outbreak ( i.e. , one whose size is of the same order as the population size ) occurs with nonzero probability if and only if @xmath11 .",
    "suppose that @xmath11 and a fraction @xmath12 of the population is vaccinated with a perfect vaccine in advance of an epidemic .",
    "then @xmath10 is reduced to @xmath13 , since a proportion @xmath12 of infectious contacts is with vaccinated individuals .",
    "it follows that a major outbreak is almost surely prevented if and only if @xmath14 .",
    "this well - known result , which gives the critical vaccination coverage to prevent a major outbreak and goes back at least to 1964 ( e.g. , smith @xcite ) , is widely used to inform public health authorities .    as a consequence of the above result",
    ", many analyses of vaccination strategies in the epidemic modelling literature have focussed on reducing @xmath10 to its critical value of one . however , if the population is large , both the total size and the duration of an outbreak may still be appreciable . indeed , in the limit as the population size tends to infinity , when @xmath15 , both of these quantities have infinite expectation under any plausible modelling assumptions .",
    "in practice , there may be a cost associated with an individual contracting the disease being modelled , in which case it is of interest to determine vaccination strategies which reduce the expected value of the total cost of an outbreak to an acceptable level .",
    "alternatively , it may be desired to control the duration of an outbreak , for example , if the presence of an outbreak means that restrictions are placed on the population within which it is spreading .",
    "clearly , for large populations , both of these aims necessitate that @xmath10 is reduced to somewhat less than one .",
    "the above remarks pertain to the common situation of controlling an epidemic that is in its increasing phase .",
    "a different situation arises with diseases , such as measles and mumps , which are controlled by mass vaccination but small outbreaks still occur among unvaccinated individuals . supplementary vaccination may be used to reduce the size or duration of such outbreaks ( as in the illustrative example of mumps in bulgaria in section  [ illus ] of this paper ) .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs with pathogens , such as monkeypox virus , which primarily affect animals but spill over into human populations giving stuttering chains of human - to - human transmission ( lloyd - smith _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . in at least some of the above scenarios",
    ", it may be the case that a specific vaccination level can not be achieved immediately but rather the fraction of the population that is vaccinated will be time - dependent .",
    "the aim of this paper is to develop a methodology based on branching processes for addressing the above issues in a unified fashion .",
    "gonzlez _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied properties of the time to extinction of an epidemic given that a fraction @xmath12 of individuals is vaccinated , when the number of infectious individuals in the population is modelled by a continuous - time bhbp and a ( more general ) continuous - time sbp , respectively . in an earlier work ,",
    "de serres _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used a discrete - time bienaym  galton ",
    "watson branching process to study the spread of an infectious disease under various control measures , specifically to estimate the effective ( i.e. , post - control ) value of @xmath10 from observations on size and durations of small outbreaks .",
    "the main objective in gonzlez _",
    "@xcite was to determine the optimal proportion of susceptible individuals which has to be vaccinated so that the mean ( or given quantile of the ) extinction time of the disease is less than some specified value . to that end , stochastic monotonicity and continuity properties of the distribution function and mean of the time that the infection survives , depending on the vaccination coverage rate",
    "were first determined .    in the present paper ,",
    "we extend the results in gonzlez _",
    "@xcite in several directions that are both practically and theoretically important .",
    "first , we assume that the spread of infection is modelled as a cmj branching process .",
    "the cmj branching process is appropriate for modelling the early stages of a very wide variety of sir epidemics , and includes both bhbp and sbp as special cases .",
    "second , we consider more general vaccination processes . in gonzlez _",
    "_ @xcite it was assumed that the fraction of the population that is vaccinated remained constant with time .",
    "we now allow this fraction to be an arbitrary but specified function of time , thus capturing for example the setting in which people are vaccinated as the disease spreads .",
    "third , we consider the control of more general functions of the epidemic process .",
    "@xcite focused on controlling the duration of the epidemic .",
    "the methods developed in this paper are applicable to a wide class of functions of the epidemic process .",
    "in addition to the duration of an outbreak , this class includes , for example , the total number of people infected and the maximum number of infected people present during the epidemic .",
    "the methodology of the paper is very different from that of gonzlez _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . the key stochastic monotonicity and continuity results in these papers",
    "were obtained by analysis of integral equations governing properties of the time to extinction of the branching process . in the present paper , a main tool is coupling and , in particular , a pruning method of constructing a realisation of a vaccinated process from that of the corresponding unvaccinated process . as indicated in section  [ conc ] , this methodology is very powerful and applicable to a broad range of processes .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ modcoup ]",
    ", we describe a very general model for an sir epidemic in a closed , homogeneously mixing community and explain why its early spread may be approximated by a cmj branching process .",
    "we introduce a very general vaccination process and give the basic coupling construction for obtaining a realisation of the vaccinated epidemic process from that of the unvaccinated process .",
    "the theoretical results of the paper are given in section  [ sectmoncty ] . in section  [ monprune ]",
    ", we introduce functions of a realisation of a cmj branching process that are monotonically decreasing with pruning .",
    "examples of such functions include the extinction time , the maximum population size over all time and the total number of births over all time",
    ". then we prove in general , that is , independently of the function , monotonicity and continuity properties of the mean ( section  [ monmean ] ) , distribution function ( section  [ mondsn ] ) and quantiles ( section  [ monquantile ] ) of such functions . in section  [ optimal ] , we use the previous results to define optimal vaccination policies based on mean and quantiles .",
    "the theory is then specialised in section  [ timeextinction ] to the extinction time of an outbreak .",
    "the methodology is illustrated in section  [ illus ] with applications to mumps in bulgaria , where vaccination is targeted at reducing the duration of an outbreak .",
    "the paper ends with some concluding comments in section  [ conc ] .",
    "consider first the following model for the spread of an epidemic in a closed , homogeneously mixing population .",
    "initially there are @xmath16 infectives and @xmath17 susceptibles .",
    "infectious individuals have independent and identically distributed life histories @xmath18 , where @xmath1 is the time elapsing between an individual s infection and his / her eventual removal or death and @xmath2 is a point process of times , relative to an individual s infection , at which infectious contacts are made .",
    "each contact is with an individual chosen independently and uniformly from the population .",
    "if a contact is with an individual who is susceptible , then that individual becomes infected and itself makes contacts according to its life history . if a contact is with an individual who is not susceptible , then nothing happens .",
    "the epidemic ceases as soon as there is no infective present in the population .",
    "note that , for simplicity , we assume that every infectious contact with a susceptible necessarily leads to that susceptible becoming infected . the model is easily extended to the situation when each contact with a susceptible is successful ( i.e. , leads to infection ) independently with probability @xmath19 by letting @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a suitable thinning of @xmath2 .",
    "the above model is essentially that introduced by ball and donnelly @xcite , who noted that it included as special cases a range of specific models that had hitherto received considerable attention in the literature .",
    "for example , sir and seir ( susceptible @xmath9 exposed ( i.e. , latent ) @xmath9 infective @xmath9 removed ) models come under the above framework . the only difference between the above model and that in ball and donnelly @xcite is that , in the latter , each contact is with an individual chosen independently and uniformly from the @xmath17 initial susceptibles ( rather than from the entire population of @xmath22 individuals ) . in ball and donnelly",
    "@xcite , a coupling argument ( which also holds for the present model ) is used to prove strong convergence , as the number of initial susceptibles @xmath23 ( with the number of initial infectives @xmath16 held fixed ) , of the process of infectives in the epidemic model to a cmj branching process ( see jagers @xcite ) , in which a typical individual lives until age @xmath1 and reproduces at ages according to @xmath2 .",
    "thus for large @xmath17 , the epidemic may be approximated by the cmj branching process .",
    "the approximation assumes that every contact is with a susceptible individual .",
    "the proof in ball and donnelly @xcite may be extended to epidemics other than sir , for example , sis ( susceptible @xmath9 infective @xmath9 susceptible ) and sirs ( susceptible @xmath9 infective @xmath9 removed @xmath9 susceptible ) , by suitably generalizing the life history @xmath24 to allow for removed individuals to become susceptible again ( see , e.g. , ball @xcite in the context of epidemics among a population partitioned into households ) .",
    "indeed , for a very broad class of homogeneously mixing epidemic models , that covers all of the common stochastic formulations of infectious disease spread , the early stages of an epidemic in a large population with few initial infectives may be approximated by a cmj branching process .",
    "this paper is concerned with the use of vaccination schemes to control an epidemic , for example , in terms of its duration or of the total number of individuals infected .",
    "we are thus interested in the short - term behaviour of the epidemic , so we model the epidemic as a cmj branching process , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 denotes the number of infected individuals at time @xmath27 .",
    "thus @xmath28 , which we assume to be fixed , represents the number of infected individuals at the beginning of the outbreak .",
    "we model the vaccination process by a function @xmath29 $ ] , such that @xmath30 is the proportion of the population that are immune at time @xmath27 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "thus , the probability that a contact at time @xmath27 is with a susceptible ( i.e. , non - immune ) individual is @xmath32 .",
    "if the vaccine is perfect , that is , it confers immunity immediately with probability one , then @xmath30 is given by the proportion of the population that has been vaccinated by time @xmath27 .",
    "if the vaccine is imperfect then that is implicitly included in the function @xmath33 .",
    "for example , if the vaccine is all - or - nothing ( i.e. , it renders the vaccinee completely immune with probability @xmath34 , otherwise it has no effect ) , then @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the proportion of the population that has been vaccinated by time @xmath27 . note that if the immunity conferred by vaccination does not wane then @xmath33 is nondecreasing in @xmath27 .",
    "we denote by @xmath37 the vaccination version of @xmath38 , in which each birth in @xmath38 is aborted independently , with probability @xmath30 if the birth time is at time @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath39 be the space of all functions @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "we construct coupled realizations of @xmath38 and @xmath40 @xmath41 on a common probability space @xmath42 as follows .",
    "let @xmath43 be a probability space on which are defined independent life histories @xmath44 , each distributed as @xmath24 , which are pieced together in the obvious fashion to construct a realization of @xmath38 . more specifically , the life histories @xmath45 are assigned to the @xmath16 initial infectives and , for @xmath46 , the @xmath3th individual born in @xmath38 is assigned the life history @xmath47 .",
    "note that with this construction @xmath38 may be viewed as a tree , which is augmented with birth and death times of branches .",
    "let @xmath48 be a probability space on which is defined a sequence @xmath49 of independent random variables , each uniformly distributed on @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath51 .",
    "then , for @xmath52 , a realization of @xmath40 is constructed on @xmath42 as follows . for @xmath46 ,",
    "let @xmath5 denote the time of the @xmath3th birth in @xmath38 , if such a birth occurs .",
    "then this birth is deleted in @xmath40 if and only if @xmath53 .",
    "if a birth is deleted in @xmath40 , then none of the descendants of that individual in @xmath38 occurs in @xmath40 .",
    "thus , if the @xmath54th birth in @xmath38 is such a descendant then @xmath55 is redundant in the construction of @xmath40 . with the tree setting in mind ,",
    "the process of deleting an individual and all of its descendants is called _",
    "pruning_. for a previous use of pruning in a branching process framework see , for example , aldous and pitman @xcite .",
    "finally , we give some notation concerned with functions in @xmath56 , which will be used throughout the paper . for @xmath57 , write @xmath58 if @xmath59 for all @xmath60 .",
    "also , for any @xmath61 $ ] and any @xmath62 , define the function @xmath63 by @xmath64 thus , for example , @xmath65 denotes the constant function equal to @xmath12 and @xmath66 denotes the constant function equal to @xmath67 .",

    "as an illustration of how to apply our theoretical results and to show their usefulness , we analyze a mumps data set from bulgaria . in bulgaria",
    ", an increasing number of new cases of individuals infected with mumps has been observed in recent years ( see figure  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "this may be a result of a poor immunization of birth cohorts 19821992 ( see kojouharova _ et al . _",
    "in such a situation , it is necessary to provide supplementary doses of mumps , measles and rubella ( mmr ) vaccine targeted at those cohorts in order to shorten the duration of the outbreaks .",
    "thus our objective is to determine , using the observed data , optimal vaccination levels based on the time to extinction that guarantee , with a high probability , that the outbreak durations will be less than some suitable bound . as an example , we determine the percentage of the target cohort that must be vaccinated to guarantee that only primary and first - generation cases will be observed in at least 90% of outbreaks .    in order to apply our results , we model the spread of mumps by a cmj branching process .",
    "this is reasonable since mumps is an infectious disease which follows the seir scheme , and in general , the early stages of outbreaks following this scheme can be approximated by a cmj branching process .",
    "although this is the general situation , a deeper discussion is needed in the case of mumps . this disease concerns predominantly young people in schools and universities , which means small separate populations and population - dependent propagation .",
    "hence , the approximation of mumps outbreaks in these populations by cmj processes is valid only when outbreaks are very short , which is the case for the outbreaks we study as we show later .",
    "the data we analyze ( reported by the bulgarian ministry of health ) are the total number of new cases of infected individuals with mumps observed weekly in each province of bulgaria from 2005 to 2008 , whose birth cohorts were poorly immunized .",
    "notice that we do not observe outbreak durations , so , first , we describe the procedure to derive the outbreak durations from these data",
    ". then , taking into account the main features of mumps transmission , we select an appropriate general branching process to describe the evolution of infected individuals in an outbreak and estimate its main parameters from the data set . finally ,",
    "once the model is fitted , we propose optimal vaccination levels based on the quantiles of the outbreak duration .",
    "our first task is to determine the behaviour of mumps outbreak durations in bulgaria from 2005 to 2008 , since our optimal vaccination level is based on outbreak duration .",
    "however , outbreak durations have not been registered ; only the total number of new cases of infected individuals with mumps in each province has been observed ( see figure  [ f1_bis ] ) .",
    "thus , instead , we derive the outbreak durations from this data set , taking into account the main features of mumps transmission .",
    "mumps is a viral infectious disease of humans and spreads from person to person through the air .",
    "the period between someone being transmitted mumps and that person first showing symptoms of mumps is called the incubation period for mumps .",
    "this incubation period can be 12 to 25 days and the average is 16 to 18 days . the infectious period ( i.e. , when an individual is able to transmit the mumps virus to others ) starts about 2 days before the onset of symptoms and usually , an individual with mumps symptoms is immediately isolated from the population ( see http://kidshealth.org ) .",
    "in view of the range of the incubation period , we consider that an outbreak is formed by the cases that appear in a province in a sequence of weeks with no more than three consecutive weeks without cases",
    ". that is , when we observe more than three weeks without cases we consider that the outbreak has become extinct , with the next outbreak starting in the first subsequent week in which there is at least one new case . applying this procedure for each province , we have obtained 262 outbreaks .",
    "the left plot in figure  [ zbar ] could represent one such outbreak initiated by one infected individual . in this schematic representation",
    ", we have considered that the infectious period is _",
    "negligible _ due to the fact that infected individuals are immediately isolated when they show symptoms .",
    "the variable @xmath427 denotes the underlying branching process , which is not observed .",
    "the segments over / under @xmath427 indicates the lengths of time for which @xmath427 takes the corresponding values .",
    "the tick marks on the axis represent weeks , and @xmath428 the number of new cases observed during the @xmath240th week .",
    "indeed , @xmath428 , @xmath429 , are the variables that are observed . in this context , by outbreak duration we mean the time elapsing between the appearance of the first case until isolation of the last one , that is the time to extinction of the branching process minus the incubation period of the first individual .",
    "thus , a more accurate way to approximate outbreak duration from the observed data is by the total number of weeks until extinction of the virus ( giving an error , due to discretization , of at most one week ) , yielding seven weeks in the outbreak of figure  3 ( left ) .     denotes the underlying branching process and",
    "@xmath428 the number of new cases in the @xmath240th week .",
    "right : durations for outbreaks started with one infected individual . ]    for each of the 262 outbreaks , we calculated the total number of weeks until extinction of the virus ( and , also , the outbreak size , i.e. , total number of infected individuals ) .",
    "we noticed that the behaviour of these outbreak durations depends on the initial number of infected individuals .",
    "hence , we have considered only those outbreaks which started with one infected individual , a total of 144 .",
    "we checked that both outbreak duration and outbreak size were homogeneous between provinces ( kruskal  wallis test : @xmath19-values 0.4763 and 0.4782 , resp . ) and consequently assumed that disease propagation in the different provinces are independent replications of the same process .",
    "thus , the right plot in figure  [ zbar ] shows the histogram of outbreak durations for all 144 outbreaks started with one infected individual .",
    "we observe two different groups , outbreaks for which their duration is less than 10 weeks ( comprising 134 outbreaks ) and another group where the outbreak duration is greater than 10 weeks ( comprising the remaining ten outbreaks ) .",
    "possibly , this happens because some cases observed in a week could not come from cases of previous weeks , and then new outbreaks could have appeared overlapping in time .",
    "hence , we consider that the outbreaks corresponding to durations of this last group may have been initiated no more than 10 weeks before .",
    "thus , outbreak durations greater than 10 weeks have been removed from our study , and only durations less than 10 weeks have been considered in order not to overestimate the duration of the outbreaks . nevertheless , an outbreak with apparent duration less than 10 weeks could actually be the superposition of two or more separate outbreaks , but we can not determine this .",
    "the left plot of figure  [ f2 ] shows the durations of the 134 outbreaks considered .",
    "we notice that 83% of these outbreaks have only one infected individual , so their outbreak durations are 0 .",
    "the remaining 17% of outbreaks seem to have a cyclical behaviour with period given by the mean of the incubation period ( approximately 2.5 weeks ) .",
    "as noted above , mumps is a contagious disease of humans that is spread from person to person through the air",
    ". the most common method of transmission is through coughing or sneezing , which can spread droplets of saliva and mucus infected with the mumps virus .",
    "hence , when an infected person coughs or sneezes , the droplets atomize and can enter the eyes , nose , or mouth of another person .",
    "following mumps transmission , a person does not immediately become sick .",
    "once the virus enters the body , it travels to the back of the throat , nose and lymph glands in the neck , where it begins to multiply . as indicated previously , this period between mumps transmission and the beginning of mumps symptoms is the incubation period for mumps .",
    "people who have mumps are most contagious from 2 days before symptoms begin to 6 days after they end and transmission may occur at anytime in that period .",
    "since an individual with mumps symptoms is immediately isolated from the population , the infectious period is very short in comparison with the incubation period , so , as indicated previously , we assume that transmission occurs only at the end point of an individual s incubation period .",
    "this assumption simplifies the mathematical model and does not influence strongly outbreak duration .",
    "as the end of the incubation period means that an individual s viral load has reached a given threshold to produce clinical signs , we assume that the mean number of individuals infected by an infected individual is constant and does not depend on the length of his / her incubation period .",
    "an earlier analysis of these mumps data using bienaym ",
    "watson branching processes is given in angelov and slavtchova ",
    ". however , the above observations imply that the bellman  harris branching process ( bhbp ) ( see athreya and ney @xcite ) is a more appropriate model for mumps transmission and indeed it provides an improved fit to these data . recall that a bhbp is a cmj branching process , in which an individual reproduces only at the end of his / her life - time , according to an offspring law which is the same for all the individuals . in the epidemiological context , age is the incubation period and the reproduction law is the contagion distribution .",
    "next , we describe the incubation period and contagion distributions used to model mumps transmission in each outbreak in bulgaria by means of the same bhbp ( recall that we did not find any difference in the behaviour of the outbreaks in different provinces ) .",
    "we assume that the incubation period @xmath1 follows a gamma distribution , with shape parameter @xmath430 and rate @xmath431 , so @xmath1 has mean @xmath432 and probability density function @xmath433 where @xmath434 is the gamma function , and that the contagion distribution follows a poisson distribution with mean @xmath103 .",
    "these distributions are appropriate for the incubation period and the number of infections , respectively ( see , e.g. , daley and gani @xcite , farrington and grant @xcite , farrington _",
    "_ @xcite or mode and sleeman @xcite ) .",
    "intuitively , @xmath103 , the mean number of individuals infected by an infected individual , represents the power of the virus . taking into account that the incubation period is estimated between 12 and 25 days and the average is 16 to 18 days",

    ". the total number of births in a bhbp has the same distribution as that in a bienaym  galton ",

    "@xmath450 and @xmath451 , whence @xmath452 .",
    "note that inference based on duration of outbreaks is less sensitive to underreporting than that based on the total number of births .",
    "however , estimating the offspring law based on the time to extinction of each outbreak turns into a difficult problem in branching processes theory , even for the simplest model ( see , e.g. , farrington",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) .    applying the general theory of branching processes ,",
    "since the estimated value of @xmath103 is less than  1 , we deduce that mumps transmission can still occur in bulgaria , but such spread can not lead to a large - scale epidemic .",
    "this fact is consistent with the figures  [ f1 ] and [ f1_bis ] .",
    "although the epidemic becomes extinct , it can have different levels of severity .",
    "one measure of severity is the mean size of an outbreak , excluding the initial case , viz .",
    "@xmath453 , which in our case is estimated by 0.463 . however , we are concerned with the problem of how to shorten outbreak durations by vaccination . to this end , we analyze the random variable @xmath454 , the time to extinction of a bhbp with incubation period and contagion distributions as described above .",
    "note that @xmath167 , as @xmath455 , so here @xmath454 is the extinction time when there is no supplementary vaccination .",
    "the variable @xmath454 includes the incubation period of the initial individual , which is not observed in practice .",
    "thus , from now on , we use the random variable @xmath456 , the difference between @xmath454 and the incubation period of the initial individual ( i.e. , the definition of outbreak duration given in the previous subsection ) to model mumps outbreak duration in bulgaria .",
    "the right plot in figure  [ f2 ] shows a histogram of @xmath457 simulated durations of outbreaks ( rounded up to the nearest integer ) , each initiated by one infected individual and modelled by a bhbp with the above parameters .",
    "we notice that in 72.9% of these simulated outbreaks the initial infected individual does not infect any new individual ( recall 83% for real data ) .",
    "moreover , the simulated outbreak durations show the same cyclical behaviour as seen in the real data .    comparing real and simulated durations",
    ", we deduce that mumps outbreak durations in bulgaria can be modelled by the variable @xmath456 ( pearson s chi - squared test : @xmath19-value 0.2951 , grouping the tail for values greater than 8) .",
    "once we have fitted the model , in order to apply our theoretical results we have assumed that the proportion of immune individuals is constant with time , since , generally , vaccination is applied when an individual is a child and the disease spreads when he / she is a teenager . in the particular case of supplementary vaccination for bulgarian mumps , for simplicity",
    "we assume that this vaccination process occurs simultaneously across the country ( e.g. , in secondary schools at the same specific time ) . to determine the optimal vaccination levels , we denote by @xmath458 the difference between @xmath459 and the incubation period of the initial individual , when the proportion of immune individuals in the population is @xmath12 , with @xmath460 . in the same way as was proved for @xmath459 ( see corollary  [ teob3 ] ) , we deduce that @xmath458 has the same quantile properties depending on @xmath12 as @xmath459 ( notice that @xmath458 is monotonically decreasing with pruning ) .",
    "therefore , next we propose vaccination policies based on the quantiles of @xmath458 , with @xmath461 .",
    "specifically , for fixed @xmath19 and @xmath27 , with @xmath377 and @xmath462 , we seek vaccination policies which guarantee that the mumps virus becomes extinct in each outbreak , with probability greater than or equal to @xmath19 , not later than time @xmath27 after the outbreak has been detected with @xmath359 initial infected individuals , that is=-1 @xmath463=0 where @xmath464 denotes the quantile of order @xmath465 of the variable @xmath466 .",
    "for @xmath467 .",
    "right : behaviour of @xmath468 depending on @xmath12 , with @xmath460 . ]    as an illustration , we take @xmath469 , @xmath470 and @xmath471 , being the time measured in weeks .",
    "first we justify these values .",
    "consider the value of @xmath359 . since the number of infected individuals at the beginning of an outbreak is unknown ,",
    "we bound it by the greatest number of individuals infected by one infected individual .",
    "taking into account that the contagion distribution is poisson and the estimate of @xmath103 , we obtain the upper bound to be @xmath472 , and therefore we take @xmath469 .",
    "moreover , we select @xmath471 , which , taking into account the features of the incubation period , guarantees that only primary and first - generation cases will be observed . since in our situation the estimated value of @xmath103 is less than  1 , to approximate @xmath473 , we need to obtain the empirical distribution of @xmath458 , for @xmath461 , using the monte - carlo method described in section  [ optimal ] . to this end , for each @xmath474 , with @xmath475 , @xmath476 processes have been simulated and their duration calculated .",
    "the left plot in figure  [ f3 ] shows the behaviour of the empirical distribution function of @xmath458 for several values of @xmath12 .",
    "notice that as @xmath12 increases , the outbreak duration decreases in a continuous way , in accordance with corollaries [ teob1 ] and [ teob2 ] .",
    "the right plot in figure  [ f3 ] shows the behaviour of @xmath468 depending on @xmath12 , which is in accordance with corollary  [ teob3 ] . since @xmath477 ,",
    "our model estimates that the duration of 90% of outbreaks in bulgaria is less than 6.97 weeks , if vaccination is not applied ( in our real data 97% of outbreaks have durations less than 6 weeks ) . in order to shorten the outbreak duration , from our study",
    ", we deduce that @xmath478 ( see right plot in figure  [ f3 ] ) .",
    "therefore , vaccinating a proportion of 60% of susceptible individuals in the target cohort , guarantees that in at least 90% of outbreaks of mumps in bulgaria only primary and first - generation cases will be observed after the vaccination .",
    "finally , we notice that @xmath479 , that is , to guarantee that at least the 90% of outbreaks do not spread after vaccination , the vaccination level should be 94% of susceptible individuals in the target cohort .",

    "thus we have performed a sensitivity analysis of their influence on the optimal vaccination level .",
    "we have considered gamma distributions with mean and shape parameter @xmath481 taking values in a grid ( giving different probabilities for the incubation period belonging to range 1225 , which we denote as percentages of coverage ) , yielding the results shown in table  [ sa ] . one can observe that increasing the mean ( holding @xmath481 fixed ) clearly increases the duration of the epidemic leading to higher values of @xmath473 .",
    "moreover , increasing the shape parameter @xmath481 ( holding the mean fixed ) decreases the variance of lifetimes and hence also the chance of long outbreak duration , leading to lower values of @xmath473 . the optimal vaccination level",
    "@xmath480 is fairly stable in the vicinity of the chosen values of 17 and 50 for the mean and shape parameter @xmath481 , respectively .    from a computational point of view",
    "it is interesting to note that to find optimal vaccination policies , the simulation method based on _ pruning _ , described at the end of section  [ optimal ] , has proved to be at least 17% faster than those in gonzlez _",
    "@xcite , which are also simulation - based methods but work directly with the distribution of the extinction time .",
    "for the bhbp there exist other methods to approximate the distribution function of the time to extinction based on solving numerically an associated integral equation ( see martnez and slavtchova - bojkova @xcite , which includes comparison with simulation - based methods ) . unlike the latter approach",
    ", the monte - carlo method proposed in section  [ optimal ] is easily extended to time - dependent vaccination processes .",
    "all the computations and simulations have been made with the statistical computing and graphics language and environment @xmath482 ( `` gnu s '' , see @xcite ) .",
    "the coupled pruning technique for proving monotonicity and continuity properties of functions defined on cmj branching processes depending on the vaccination function @xmath33 is both simple and powerful .",
    "it is clear that the proofs generalise easily to more general branching processes , such as multitype cmj branching processes , time - inhomogeneous branching processes and branching processes in a random environment .",
    "the function @xmath33 does not have to represent vaccination .",
    "it could represent any control of disease propagation that has the effect of reducing either the number of susceptibles or the probability that a contacted susceptible becomes infected .",
    "however , for the coupled pruning technique to work it is necessary that , in the branching process setting , the control affects only the probability that a birth is aborted and not the intrinsic reproduction law of the branching process .",
    "thus , for example , the method can not be applied to density - dependent processes , such as population size dependent branching processes , if the density dependence relates to the size of the unvaccinated population rather than the total population size .",
    "given that the results in the bulgarian mumps illustration are based on simulation alone , it may seem more appropriate to use an epidemic model rather than a branching process that approximates such a model .",
    "however , there are several advantages in using the simpler branching process formulation .",
    "first , branching process models can be fitted directly to the data more easily ; in particular they do not require knowledge of the size of the population in which the outbreaks are occurring .",
    "second , the coupled pruning technique enables the monotonicity and continuity properties pertaining to vaccination functions to be proved easily .",
    "third , the coupled pruning technique yields an associated monte - carlo method for determining optimal vaccination processes .",
    "the framework for optimal vaccination policies studied in section  [ optimal ] can be extended to include alternative formulations of optimal policies .",
    "for example , one may define a cost @xmath483 associated with each vaccination process @xmath135 and then seek vaccination processes from a subset @xmath298 of @xmath39 which either ( i ) minimise @xmath483 subject to @xmath484 or ( ii ) minimise @xmath173 subject to @xmath485 , where @xmath486 is specified .",
    "provided the cost function , @xmath483 is suitably monotonic and continuous in @xmath33 and @xmath298 is totally ordered , theorems [ teoa1 ] and [ teoa2 ] imply the existence of unique such optimal vaccination processes and it should be possible to extend the monte - carlo algorithm at the end of section  [ optimal ] to estimate the optimal vaccination processes . optimal vaccination policies that permit vaccination costs to be taken into account are especially relevant in animal vaccination .",
