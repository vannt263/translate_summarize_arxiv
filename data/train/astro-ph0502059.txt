    "with the lowest nebular metallicity known in the local universe [ ( o / h ) @xmath1 0.02 ( o / h)@xmath2 ; skillman & kennicutt 1993 ] , izw18 plays a key role in the study of galaxy evolution .",
    "understanding the nature of the star - forming fragments predicted at high redshift requires a detailed study of nearby potentially `` young '' galaxies .",
    "estimates of the age of the stellar population in izw18 based on single - star photometry suggest an age of less than 1 gyr ( e.g. , hunter & thronson 1995 ; aloisi etal .  1999 ; \" ostlin 2000 ; izotov & thuan 2004 ) .",
    "an alternative probe of the unobscured , recent ( 0.3ex-0.75em0.65ex  30 myr ) star formation in a galaxy can be obtained with radio continuum observations .",
    "three types of radio continuum emission are seen in local star - forming galaxies ( see condon 1992 for a detailed review ) .",
    "first , thermal free - free emission ( characterized by a nearly flat spectral index , @xmath30.1 , where s@xmath4  @xmath5 ) is proportional to the total lyman continuum flux and hence can be used as an accurate star formation rate estimator .",
    "second , nonthermal synchrotron emission , produced in supernovae ( sne ) explosions and remnants , shows a more negative spectral index ( @xmath61.2 @xmath70.4 ) . finally , free - free absorption can occur in young , dense",
    ", heavily - embedded clusters that show an inverted spectrum ( @xmath8 0.0 ; turner etal .",
    "1998 , kobulnicky & johnson 1999 , johnson & kobulnicky 2003 ) .",
    "distinguishing between these emission mechanisms allows one to constrain the ages of the emitting components : inverted sources are very young ( ages @xmath1 10@xmath9 - 10@xmath10 yr ; johnson etal .",
    "2001 ) ; thermal regions have ages comparable to those of h  ii  regions ( @xmath11 10 myr ) ; synchrotron radiation dominates in regions older than this .    considering the amount of observational attention that izw18 has received ,",
    "it is somewhat surprising that no detailed investigation of its radio continuum properties exists in the literature .",
    "there have been two previously published radio continuum detections , but both have been extracted from spectral line observations @xcite . in order to study the nature of radio continuum emission at the lowest available nebular metallicity , we have obtained sensitive _ very large array _ ( _ vla _ ) observations of izw18 .",
    "we compare these data to _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) images of the stellar and nebular emission . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt a distance of 12.6 mpc for izw18 @xcite ; however , most of our results ( spectral indices , comparison to _ hst _ imaging ) do not require a tightly - constrained distance estimate .",
    "_ vla _ radio continuum imaging was obtained using the a , b , and c arrays on 2003 , august 3 , and 2004 , january 20 and april 20 ( total on - source integration time @xmath12 15.1 hours ) for program ac681 .",
    "all reductions were performed using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) package .",
    "first , interference and bad data were removed .",
    "flux , gain and phase calibrations were then applied , derived from observations of 1331 + 305 ( 3c286 ; primary calibrator ) and 0921@xmath13622 ( secondary calibrator ) . the l - band ( 20 cm ) and x - band ( 3.6 cm ) observations were obtained in two arrays , and these _ u - v _ databases were concatenated .",
    "the calibrated _ u - v _ data were then imaged and cleaned to produce matched - beam images at each frequency that balanced resolution and sensitivity .",
    "we analyze a set of `` high '' resolution ( l - band : beam @xmath12 2.18@xmath142.01 , rms @xmath12 11.6@xmath15jybeam@xmath16 ; x - band : beam @xmath12 2.17@xmath142.07 , rms @xmath12 7.4@xmath15jybeam@xmath16 ) and a set of `` low '' resolution ( beam @xmath12 4.5 , l - band rms @xmath12 19@xmath15jybeam@xmath16 , x - band rms @xmath12 12@xmath15jybeam@xmath16 ) images .",
    "we compare our radio observations to archival _ hst _ observations of izw18 from programs go-5434 ( p.i .",
    "dufour ) , go-6536 ( p.i .",
    "skillman ) , and go-9400 ( p.i .",
    "the detailed handling of the data from programs 6536 and 5434 are presented in @xcite .",
    "we use the same narrowband h@xmath0  image presented in that work for analysis here [ total h@xmath0  flux @xmath12 ( 3.26@xmath170.3)@xmath1410@xmath18 ergs@xmath16@xmath19 , implying a current star formation rate of @xmath1 0.05 m@xmath2yr@xmath16 @xcite ] . from program 9400",
    ", we use an _",
    "hst_/acs f555w image for comparison with the stellar continuum .",
    "based on the positions of _ hst _ guide stars in the acs field and the agreement of the radio and h@xmath0  peaks , we conservatively estimate the uncertainty in the coordinate solution to be better than 0.5  rms .",
    "in figure  [ figcap1 ] we present the low - resolution images overlaid with contours at various levels .",
    "we measure global flux densities ( by integrating continuous emission surrounding the galaxy after blanking at the 3@xmath20 level ) at l- and x - bands of 1.79@xmath170.18 mjy and 0.78@xmath170.08 mjy , respectively , corresponding to a global spectral index of @xmath60.46@xmath170.06 ( see table  [ t1 ] ) .",
    "the continuum emission is more spatially extended at 20 cm than at 3.6 cm ( although the latter data are significantly more sensitive ) ; indeed , emission above the 3@xmath20 level is detected out to @xmath1 12  ( deconvolved ) northwest of the emission peak at l - band ( corresponding to a linear distance of @xmath1 730 pc at the adopted distance ) , but only to @xmath1 7.5  at x - band . as argued in the next section ,",
    "this is the result of a synchrotron halo surrounding the system .      since the thermal radio continuum luminosity is proportional to the total photoionization rate , there exists a well - defined relation between radio continuum luminosity and other direct star formation rate indicators ( e.g. , h@xmath0  emission ) . in systems with little extinction in the optical",
    ", this relation can be used to estimate the expected thermal fraction of detected radio continuum emission . in izw18 , the low detected extinctions ( a@xmath21 0.3ex-0.75em0.65ex  0.5 mag . ; see cannon etal .",
    "2002 ) imply that h@xmath0  provides a nearly complete census of the ongoing star formation .",
    "we can estimate the expected thermal components at each frequency using the relations presented in @xcite . for a purely thermal radio continuum source in the absence of extinction ,",
    "the h@xmath0  flux and the flux density at a given frequency are related via :    @xmath22    where j@xmath23 is the flux at h@xmath0  in ergs@xmath16@xmath19 , j@xmath4 is the flux density at the given frequency in jy , t is the electron temperature in units of 10@xmath24 k , and @xmath25 is the observed frequency in ghz .",
    "we adopt an intermediate electron temperature from @xcite of 18500 k for the entire galaxy . using the global h@xmath0  flux measured from the _ hst _ image ( see table  [ t1 ] ) , we expect flux densities of 0.47 mjy at x - band and 0.56 mjy at l - band .",
    "comparison with the measured x - band value of 0.78 mjy suggests that more than half of the 3.6 cm emission is thermal ; conversely , only @xmath1 30% of the emission at l - band is expected to be thermal .    given this expected value for thermal emission at 20 cm , @xmath26 70% of the detected emission can be attributed to a synchrotron component .",
    "if this emission has a characteristic synchrotron spectral index ( @xmath270.8 ) , then this implies a synchrotron contribution to the detected flux at x - band of 0.29 mjy .",
    "this value can be compared with the difference between total and ( predicted ) thermal fluxes , 0.31 mjy ; the agreement suggests that such a synchrotron component fits the data quite well .",
    "we present higher resolution images of the radio continuum emission from izw18 in figures  [ figcap2 ] and [ figcap3 ] , as well as overlays of the emission on _ hst _ h@xmath0  and v - band images .",
    "we resolve the emission into 4 distinct peaks at this resolution .",
    "examining these images , there is a striking correlation between h@xmath0  and radio continuum emission at this sensitivity level ; in all areas of high surface brightness h@xmath0  emission , strong radio continuum emission is prevalent .",
    "note also that the radio continuum emission closely follows the diffuse h@xmath0  shell morphology in the northwest region .",
    "the total flux densities of the individual peaks were measured using identical apertures the size of the beam or larger , centered on the peaks in the x - band image ( see figure  [ figcap2 ] and table  [ t1 ] ) .",
    "the individual radio continuum peaks are found to have a mix of thermal and nonthermal spectral indices .",
    "three of the sources ( izw18 se , nw - a ,",
    "nw - c ) have spectral indices @xmath30.27 , implying a mix of thermal and nonthermal components . izw18 nw - b , however , is consistent with nearly purely thermal emission ( @xmath270.04@xmath170.06 ) .",
    "sources izw18 se and nw - a are clearly associated with collections of the high surface brightness h  ii  regions of the galaxy .",
    "the high ( aperture integrated ) h@xmath0",
    "equivalent widths found in @xcite imply strong active star formation , while their nonthermal radio continua suggest that the areas are also rich in massive star feedback via sne explosions and remnants .",
    "this suggests that the star formation intensity was strong @xmath1 20 - 30 myr ago , as well as at the present epoch .",
    "this is in good agreement with the results of resolved stellar population analysis , where recent investigations have found a star formation rate that was elevated during the last 10 - 100 myr compared to that at present @xcite .",
    "the nature of radio continuum emission at very low metallicities is only beginning to be explored . comparing our results with those on the second - most metal poor galaxy",
    "known , sbs0335@xmath6052 @xcite , we find that both systems have a mix of nonthermal and thermal components , indicative of active massive star formation over the last @xmath1 30 myr",
    ". however , the radio spectrum of sbs0335@xmath6052 has a thermal component that manifests itself in considerable absorption at l - band and a radio turnover between 1.4 and 4.8 ghz .",
    "while the present dataset has fewer frequencies , we would be sensitive to a similar spectral turnover in izw18 ( as this would result in positive , rather than negative , spectral indices between 3.6 and 20 cm ) .",
    "the differences in the radio continuum properties of izw18 and sbs0335@xmath6052 are most easily explained as the results of the more vigorous star formation event that is underway in the latter .",
    "izw18 appears to be undergoing star formation in discrete stellar clusters and h  ii   regions [ see table  [ t1 ] for h@xmath0  luminosities of the radio emission peaks studied here , and cannon etal .  (",
    "2002 ) for those of other clusters ] , and infrared imaging ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) does not suggest embedded regions that would be able to give rise to `` super star clusters '' ( sscs ; see oconnell 2004 for a recent review of ssc properties ) .",
    "sbs0335@xmath6052 , on the other hand , hosts multiple sscs @xcite and regions of exceptionally high extinction and embedded star formation for a very metal poor galaxy @xcite .",
    "given that complex ( and often inverted ) spectral indices typically arise from such regions @xcite , it is perhaps not surprising that the radio spectra of izw18 and sbs0335@xmath6052 appear to differ .",
    "to summarize , we have detected thermal and nonthermal emission in izw18 , including a synchrotron halo .",
    "this low - metallicity , low - dust system shows a radio continuum spectrum between 20 and 3.6 cm that is typical of star - forming dwarf galaxies ; however , the radio properties differ markedly from those found in the second most metal - poor galaxy , sbs0335@xmath6052 .",
    "although the sample is small , the variety of radio continua found at very low metallicities suggests that there is not a strong metallicity dependence for the production of radio continuum emission .",
    "indeed , it is not necessary that one should exist ; thermal continua are produced by stars that have formed , while nonthermal continua are typically the result of the evolution of massive stars . while there certainly exist differences in the way that the stars form at different metallicities , once the stars have formed , radio continuum emission appears to be ubiquitous ( though complex and dependent on other factors ) in massive star formation regions regardless of metallicity .",
