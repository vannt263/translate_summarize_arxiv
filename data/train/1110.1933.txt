    "stellar bars are common among spirals , and are believed to have an important role in the evolution of their host galaxies . several studies presented ideas that bars channel gas from the outer disk into the nuclear region @xcite , and that they redistribute angular momentum of the baryonic and dark matter components of disk galaxies @xcite .",

    "some simulations showed that bars can be destroyed by a large central mass concentration @xcite .",
    "this result indicates two possibilities .",
    "first , it is possible that currently non - barred spirals had a bar in the past @xcite .",
    "second , bars may be recurrent @xcite .",
    "however , there are conflicting results that bars are dynamically robust structures , requireing large mass concentrations to dissolve bars @xcite .",
    "therefore it remains an open question why some spirals have a bar structure , while others do not .",
    "most previous studies tried to explain the formation and evolution of bars through internal secular evolution only . to get a better understanding of bars , we need to consider not only internal but also external influence on their evolution .",
    "@xcite showed that the fraction of barred galaxies is significantly larger in the core of the coma cluster than in the outer part of the cluster , and @xcite argued that the strong tidal field in the core of coma can transform non - barred spirals into barred ones .",
    "some studies claimed through n - body simulations that bars are triggered by external effects such as tidal interactions @xcite and the passage of a companion galaxy @xcite .",
    "then it is expected that the bar fraction ( @xmath12 ) may be different in different environments",
    ".    there have been observational efforts to find the relation between environment and the bar fraction .",
    "@xcite found that the bar fraction in the fornax and virgo clusters is slightly higher than the average value for fields .",
    "@xcite also suggested from the analysis of 930 galaxies in the northern shapley - ames catalog that @xmath12 in cluster environments is larger than in groups or fields .",
    "the sizes of their sample were not large enough to derive a statistically meaningful result , so that they concluded that dependence of @xmath12 on environment seems to be unclear .",
    "recently some studies used large samples including thousands of galaxies drawn from the sloan digital sky survey ( hereafter , sdss ; @xcite ) , but environmental dependence of the bar fraction is still controversial @xcite .",
    "recently , there have been efforts to find relations between bars and diverse properties of their host galaxies from statistical approaches using large galaxy samples .",
    "@xcite presented that @xmath12 in @xmath14-band is relatively higher in later type spirals that are bluer and less - concentrated systems .",
    "@xcite also obtained a similar result .",
    "however , @xcite found an opposite result that the optical bar fraction significantly increases as ( @xmath15 ) color becomes redder and they suggested a color bimodality in barred galaxies .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found that the bar fraction shows a bimodal distribution of stellar mass with a break at log(@xmath16)@xmath17 , and also presented that the bar fraction can be described as a function of the concentration of galaxies .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine how the existence of bar structure is related with the physical properties of galaxies and to find what kind of environmental conditions the barred galaxies prefer .",
    "we use a sample of galaxies in the sdss , and measure the bar fraction as a function of internal properties of galaxies such as luminosity , color , star formation rate , concentration , and central velocity dispersion .",

    "these automated methods can be applied to large samples of galaxies , and can determine the properties of bars quantitatively .",
    "there is a significant difference in the bar fraction depending on the method for selecting bars .",
    "the ellipse fitting method suggests that the bar fraction is nearly 50% in optical bands : @xmath85 in b - band @xcite , 47% in i - band @xcite , @xmath86 @xcite and @xmath87 @xcite in @xmath14-band .",

    "@xcite pointed out that this discrepancy is caused by differences in wavelengths and selection criterion .",
    "it is possible that the ellipse fitting method classify many ovals or central distorted features as bars .",
    "however , it is not obvious what causes such a difference at the moment",
    ". thus future works are needed to investigate differences between visual inspection and the ellipse fitting method .",
    "we select barred galaxies by visual inspection of @xmath92 combined color images ( hereafter color images ) .",
    "color images are obtained from _",
    "http://cas.sdss.org _ using _ visual tools_. we use the color images because the stellar population within a bar is generally different from that in other part of its host galaxy and because it is easier to visually identify a bar when color information is available .",
    "the selection of barred galaxies is performed on both early - type and late - type galaxies . for late - type galaxies ,",
    "we adopt an @xmath41-band isophotal axis ratio limit , @xmath93 , to reduce the internal extinction effects and the selection bias due to the inclination .",
    "thus , the number of selected late - type galaxies in the s1 sample is 10,674 .",
    "we classify visually selected barred galaxies into four classes based on the bar strength taking into account the structural properties of host galaxies . in the case of late - type barred galaxies we estimate relative sizes of bars to their host galaxies by eyes , and divide them into strong - barred ( sb1 ) , weak - barred ( sb2 ) , and ambiguous barred galaxies ( sb3 ) .",
    "the criteria of classification and the number of galaxies in each class are as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) sb0 : 905 early - type galaxies having a bar structure and no spiral arm .",
    "therefore , they are barred lenticular galaxies .",
    "\\(2 ) sb1 : 2,542 late - type galaxies having a strong bar .",
    "the size of bars is larger than one quarter of the size of their host galaxies .",
    "generally these galaxies are early - type or intermediate - type spirals with well - developed arms and a relatively large bulge .",
    "\\(3 ) sb2 : 698 late - type galaxies having a weak bar .",
    "the size of bars is smaller than one quarter of the size of their host galaxies .",
    "host galaxies are typically late - type spirals with a small bulge .",
    "\\(4 ) sb3 : 401 late - type galaxies for which it is difficult to decide whether it is barred or not .",
    "figures [ exam_bar1 ] and [ exam_bar2 ] display color images of some typical galaxies belonging to the four classes .",
    "we also show rc3 classification type or na10 classification type whenever available .",
    "figure [ abtrue_bf ] shows the fraction of galaxies in each bar class as a function of @xmath94 axis ratio .",
    "highly inclined galaxies have small @xmath94 , while nearly face - on galaxies have a value close to 1 .",
    "when @xmath93 , @xmath12 remains nearly constant in each bar class .",
    "this means that our morphology classification of face - on late - type galaxies with @xmath93 provides a reliable and robust @xmath12 that is unaffected by the inclination of galaxies .",
    "we compare the results of our classification with those of two previous works : the morphology classifications in rc3 and na10 .",
    "rc3 classified barred galaxies into three classes : strong barred ( sb ) , weak barred ( sx ) , and non - barred ( sa ) .",

    "however , the cmc is the crucial parameter for strong bars in high mass systems and for weak bars .      several previous studies expected that bars are affected by environmental effect , such as tidal interactions with companion galaxies .",
    "thompson(1981 ) found that @xmath12 is two times larger in the central part of the coma cluster than in the outer region , and argued that drastic tidal interactions in the core of coma could generate bar instabilities effectively .",
    "later , some simulations succeeded in generating bars induced by galaxy interactions @xcite .",
    "however , contrary to these expectations , the enhancement of @xmath12 in the high - density region was not found in recent observational studies @xcite . in particular , based on a sample of @xmath96 800 bright galaxies ( @xmath183 ) in the abell 901/2 supercluster , @xcite measured the bar fraction in the optical band , and they did not find any clear correlation between @xmath12 and local density .    in this study we studied the dependence of @xmath12 on environment using a galaxy sample much larger than previous studies .",
    "the fraction of sb1 galaxies in the high - density regions with @xmath184 is a factor of @xmath961.5 higher than in the low - density regions with @xmath185 .",
    "this gives an impression that frequent tidal interactions in the high - density regions could form bars .",
    "but , it is found that the @xmath156-dependence disappears almost entirely , if @xmath8 color or @xmath13 is fixed , as shown in figure [ locden_params ] .",
    "also , in the case of weak bars , we do not find any clear dependence on @xmath148 .",
    "this indicates that bars are neither stimulated nor destroyed in accordance with the background density , and that the physical processes such as ram pressure heating , strangulation , and tidal interaction with groups and clusters do not seem to be related to the bar phenomenon .",
    "the environment set up by the nearest neighbor galaxy also does not influence @xmath12 ( both @xmath7 and @xmath101 ) when the separation between galaxies is larger than 0.1 times the virial radius of the neighbor . while strong bars seem to be destroyed by the strong tidal interactions with companions when a galaxy is located within 0.1 times the virial radius ( figure [ distnei_4params_sb1 ] ) .",
    "this result implies that it is difficult for bars to be maintained under strong tidal interactions .",
    "this is consistent with an expectation of @xcite who showed from numerical simulation that galaxy mergers weaken and shorten bars .",
    "strong tidal interactions can disturb stellar motion in the central part of galaxies , boost the central velocity dispersion , and finally , destroy bars or weaken their strength .",
    "this interpretation is supported by @xcite s finding that the angular momentum of spiral galaxies , not only in its magnitude but also in its orientation , is affected by the presence of a companion : the spin parameter decreases and a corresponding increase in alignment also appears once the galaxies are well within the virial radius of their neighbor .",
    "in addition , the destruction of bars during strong tidal interactions occurs regardless of neighbor s morphology , indicating that bars do not evolve through the hydrodynamic interactions with nearby galaxies .",
    "so far , some simulations expect that bar structures are generated by galaxy interactions @xcite .",
    "however , we do not find any evidence for stimulating bars by environmental effects even in the case of weak bars .",
    "we studied the dependence of bar fraction of late - type galaxies on internal physical properties of galaxies and environmental factors .",
    "we used a volume - limited sample of galaxies , drawn from the sdss dr7 , brighter than @xmath64 mag and at redshift @xmath20 .",
    "we classify the galaxies in our sample into barred or non - barred ones by visual inspection .",
    "to reduce contamination by internal extinction effects , we use only 10,674 late - type galaxies with axis ratio @xmath3 .",
    "our major findings are as follows .",
    "@xmath7 strongly depends on @xmath8 color : @xmath7 increases significantly as the color becomes redder .",
    "central velocity dispersion is another important parameter determining @xmath7 .",
    "the bar fraction of sb1 galaxies has a maximum value at intermediate velocity dispersions of @xmath186 km s@xmath119 .",
    "these results suggest that strong bars are dominantly hosted by intermediate - mass systems undergoing long secular evolution with little experience of recent interactions or mergers .",
    "@xmath101 also depends on @xmath8 and @xmath13 .",
    "but unlike sb1 galaxies , galaxies with bluer color or smaller @xmath13 are more likely to host weak bars .",
    "these results mean that weak bars mainly inhabit later type spirals with low mass and blue color .      \\5 .",
    "@xmath7 monotonically increases as the background density @xmath148 increases .",
    "however , this dependence disappears when @xmath8 or @xmath13 is fixed .",
    "this indicates that the background density does not play a direct role in the bar formation .",
    "in addition , we find that @xmath101 also do not depend on the background density .",
    "influence of the nearest neighbor galaxy on @xmath7 appears when the separation to the neighbor is smaller than 0.1 times the virial radius of the neighbor .",
    "@xmath7 decreases as @xmath149 decreases regardless of neighbor s morphology .",
    "it indicates that it is difficult for galaxies to maintain strong bars during strong tidal interactions , and that this phenomenon is of gravitational origin .",
    "the fraction of weak bars show little dependence on @xmath149 .",
