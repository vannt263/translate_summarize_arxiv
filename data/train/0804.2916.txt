    "the planets of sun - like stars form from a protostellar disk consisting of 0.010.1  solar masses of gas together with 1% dust by mass .",
    "the removal of orbital angular momentum from the disk is a key to understanding the origins of the planets as it determines the rate at which material spirals in to accrete on the star .",
    "the magneto - rotational instability or mri @xcite transfers angular momentum outward and taps the free energy in the differential orbital rotation of the disk to drive turbulence and regenerate magnetic fields , at locations where the gas is sufficiently ionized to couple strongly to the fields .",
    "however the minimum - mass protosolar disk , constructed by adding sufficient hydrogen and helium to the planets to give solar composition @xcite , is mostly too cold for thermal ionization .",
    "the minimum - mass disk has surface mass density @xmath0au@xmath1  g  @xmath2 and temperature @xmath3au@xmath4  k at radius @xmath5 measured in astronomical units ( au ) , and is in vertical hydrostatic balance .",
    "cosmic rays and stellar coronal x - rays are absorbed before reaching the midplane , and ionize only the surface layers .",
    "furthermore , rapid recombination on grain surfaces leads to low abundances of the free electrons otherwise responsible for most of the conductivity .",
    "consequently , much of the region where the planets form is not subject to the mri .",
    "the region consists of a laminar resistive interior sandwiched between two conducting surface layers where magneto - rotational turbulence causes an accretion flow @xcite .",
    "the interior is not completely quiescent , as waves propagating from the turbulent layers cause hydrodynamic stresses and low rates of accretion @xcite .",
    "magnetic stresses can occur in the interior under favorable conditions , if small grains are removed , for example by incorporation into planetesimals , and ionizing cosmic rays reach the disk unimpeded by the stellar wind @xcite .",
    "however , the resistive interior of the disk retains a weak coupling to the magnetic fields even if grains are present and cosmic rays are absent .",
    "the weak coupling is the topic of this paper .",
    "magnetic forces can extract angular momentum from the gas if the fields have both toroidal and poloidal components .",
    "we derive a criterion for the generation of toroidal fields by shear acting on radial fields .",
    "the ohmic diffusion quickly eliminates any vertical magnetic gradients in the resistive layer , while the conducting layers above and below prevent the fields from escaping .",
    "the resistive layer can be approximated by an axisymmetric cylindrical flow in keplerian rotation with a uniform resistivity @xmath6 .",
    "the toroidal component of the induction equation reduces to @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the radial and toroidal field components in cylindrical coordinates and @xmath10 is the orbital frequency .",
    "if also the toroidal field varies as a power - law with radius , @xmath11 , the field grows through the shear term provided @xmath12 .",
    "we consider the implications for the minimum - mass protosolar disk .",
    "the magnetic pressure is unlikely to exceed the midplane gas pressure , owing to the buoyancy of the fields .",
    "the magnetic pressure is a fixed fraction of the midplane gas pressure if the power - law index @xmath13 .",
    "the resulting criterion for shear - generated toroidal fields to grow to about ten times the radial seed field strength , @xmath14 resembles the criterion @xcite for magneto - rotational turbulence @xmath15 .",
    "however the shear criterion equation  [ eqn : shear ] allows magnetic activity at far greater resistivities , since the flattened shape of the disk requires an orbital speed @xmath16 much greater than the sound speed @xmath17 , which in turn is typically greater than the vertical alfvn speed @xmath18 .",
    "the orbital speed is a few hundred times the vertical alfvn speeds found at the midplane in numerical calculations of magneto - rotational turbulence @xcite .",
    "the part of the dead zone where the shear criterion holds is better named the `` undead zone '' because it can be reactivated by radial fields siphoned off from the adjacent turbulent layers .",
    "in contrast with models where angular momentum is removed from the top and bottom surfaces of the disk by a magneto - centrifugal wind @xcite , here the torques arise from locally - generated magnetic fields .",
    "the minimum - mass protosolar disk with well - mixed micron - sized grains has an equilibrium resistivity low enough for magneto - rotational turbulence only in the surface layers , at the radii where most of the planets formed ( figure  [ fig : mapxray ] ) .",
    "a deeper layer can generate smooth large - scale fields by shear according to equation  [ eqn : shear ] , while the midplane within 5  au of the star is almost completely decoupled from the fields .",
    "if the grains are removed by incorporation into planetary embryos , then turbulence or shear can generate magnetic fields in every part of the disk .",
    "figure  [ fig : mapxray ] was constructed as follows . the resistivity @xmath19",
    "@xmath20  s@xmath21 varies inversely with the electron fraction @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the electron number density and @xmath24 the number density of neutrals @xcite .",
    "we compute the electron fraction by solving a chemical network including ionization by stellar x - rays @xcite and @xmath25al radionuclide decay , dissociative recombination , charge exchange with metal atoms , and grain surface reactions .",
    "the recombination is treated using the reduced reaction network with grains described by @xcite .",
    "the fraction of the metal atoms free to enter the gas phase is chosen to be 1% .",
    "the resistivity depends only weakly on this fraction .",
    "the stellar x - ray ionization rate is taken from a fit to monte carlo radiative transfer results including scattering @xcite , scaled to a stellar luminosity @xmath26  erg  s@xmath21 in 5  kev thermal x - rays to match young solar - mass stars observed in the orion nebula @xcite .",
    "the fitted ionization rate is @xmath27au@xmath28  g  @xmath29 + \\exp[-\\sigma_b/8.0 $ ]  g  @xmath29)$ ]  s@xmath21 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the mass columns lying vertically above and below the point of interest .",
    "the fit underestimates the ionization rate at mass columns @xmath32  g  @xmath2 , with no significant effect on the locations of the dead and undead zones .",
    "the decay of @xmath25al in the dust grains yields an ionization rate @xmath33  s@xmath21 @xcite .",
    "a fraction 0.1% of the radioactive atoms is placed in the gas phase , giving a low rate of ionization even with grains absent .",
    "we neglect cosmic ray ionization owing to uncertainty about the extent to which the interstellar energetic particles are blocked by the wind from the young star .",
    "we show results from two 3-d isothermal stratified shearing - box @xcite mhd calculations of small patches of the minimum - mass protosolar disk using the zeus code @xcite .",
    "the first is placed at 5  au and includes well - mixed 1  @xmath34 m grains with dust - to - gas mass ratio 1% and a magnetic field with a net vertical component of 6  milligauss .",
    "the second is placed at 1  au and has no grains and a net vertical field of 30  milligauss .",
    "the net magnetic fields are weak , with midplane ratios of gas to magnetic pressure @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "the presence of the net fields ensures that the fastest - growing mode of the linear mri is spatially resolved in the calculations . to the net field in both cases",
    "is added a part with zero net flux that dissipates readily through reconnection .",
    "the vertical component is @xmath37 , the toroidal component @xmath38 and the radial component zero , where @xmath39 is the radial position and @xmath40 the box width .",
    "the strength @xmath41 of the sinusoidal field is 0.1 and 1  gauss , respectively .",
    "the resistivity is calculated using the ionization and chemical network described above except that the x - ray ionization rates are directly interpolated in the monte carlo radiative transfer results and the fit discussed above is not used .",
    "the resistivity is fixed at its initial equilibrium value at each height in the first run , while the resistivity is allowed to vary in space and time through mixing , ionization and recombination in the second run .",
    "in other respects the calculations are identical to our recent work @xcite .",
    "in particular , the vertical boundaries lie four density scale heights @xmath42 above and below the midplane and are open , allowing magnetic fields to escape leaving the patch of disk with a net radial and toroidal magnetic flux . among the non - ideal terms in the induction equation ,",
    "ambipolar diffusion is important outside @xmath43 .",
    "the ohmic resistivity is greater than the hall resistivity near the midplane at 1  au while the two are comparable at 5  au @xcite . under these conditions",
    "the ohmic term has the bigger impact on the amplitude of magneto - rotational turbulence @xcite .",
    "our calculations therefore include only the ohmic diffusion .",
    "the domain extends @xmath44 along the radial direction and @xmath45 along the toroidal direction , and is divided into 32 radial by 64 toroidal by 128 vertical zones .",
    "the two calculations give similar results over 130  orbits .",
    "a net radial magnetic field generated in the turbulent surface layers is mixed to the undead zone where it diffuses to the midplane .",
    "the shear in the undead zone generates toroidal fields ( figure  [ fig : snapshot ] ) of the opposite sign , leading to magnetic stresses that transfer angular momentum outward . lying just inside the undead zone is a dissipation layer about @xmath46 thick that receives magnetic fields when turbulent motions overshoot the edge of the well - coupled gas .",
    "the resistivity is too high for magneto - rotational turbulence and dissipates the tangled component of the fields .",
    "the ohmic diffusion time @xmath47 at the base of the dissipation layer is about 10  orbits , so that the layer acts as a filter delivering to the undead zone a magnetic field that is a recent time - average of the large - scale field at the edge of the turbulent layer . the radial field in the dissipation layer and at the midplane reverses every 20 - 50  orbits .",
    "the midplane toroidal field changes at approximately the rate @xmath48 due to the shear , indicating that local shear generation dominates other source terms @xcite .",
    "the shearing reverses the toroidal field about 10  orbits after the radial field , so that the field lines swing around to trail the rotation and the magnetic stress again becomes positive ( figure  [ fig : tzplot ] ) .",
    "a related process occurs in the sun , where magnetic fields generated in the convection zone are carried down to the tachocline and grow there through differential rotation @xcite .",
    "the protostellar disk differs in that shear occurs throughout the flow , and the turbulence is shut off by the resistivity of the gas rather than a transition to radiative energy transport .",
    "the resistivity at all heights in the disk is typically unchanged as gas mixes between the surface layers and interior , because the recombination on the grains is fast enough to keep the ionization near its local equilibrium value .",
    "however with the grains removed , recombination is slow enough for ionized gas to reach the midplane @xcite . in our calculation with no grains , the undead zone shrinks after 150  years as ionized gas is carried down from the surface layers .",
    "the flow settles after 200  years into a new steady state with an overall accretion rate 20  times greater .",
    "the midplane remains magneto - rotationally stable ( figure  [ fig : tzplot ] ) .",
    "the mass flow rate corresponding to the stresses in the mhd calculations ( figure  [ fig : hdmdotdz ] ) is sufficient for the disk to accrete on the star within a few million years , the lifetime inferred from the disk fractions in young star clusters of different ages @xcite .",
    "the magnetic contribution to the stress is several times greater than the hydrodynamic contribution in the dissipation layer , and at times when the fields are strongest in the midplane .",
    "the time - averaged midplane magnetic and hydrodynamic contributions are comparable . the undead zone rather than being inactive has a mean mass flow rate 4% to 61% of that in the turbulent layers .",
    "the midplane gas moves toward the star on average , but flows away from the star immediately after the reversals in the radial magnetic field when the field lines lead in the rotation .",
    "the root - mean - square midplane field strength found in the calculations is about 0.1  gauss at 5  au and 1  gauss at 1  au , in the range 0.17  gauss inferred from the relict magnetization of primitive meteorites that were last melted in the asteroid belt during the formation of the solar system @xcite .",
    "the agreement is consistent with the idea that the planet formation region is a laminar , magnetized accretion flow for some part of its history .    the original dead zone picture with a fixed mass column of accreting material @xcite yields a unique mass accretion rate approximately @xmath49 solar masses per year , independent of the stellar mass .",
    "in contrast , observations of t  tauri stars show the accretion rate increases with the stellar mass and has a spread of about two decades at solar mass @xcite .",
    "we suggest based on figure  [ fig : hdmdotdz ] that a similar range of accretion rates can be produced by varying the magnetic flux and the abundance of small dust grains .",
    "the radial transport of material over large distances in the early solar system is indicated by the presence of crystalline silicate grains in comet 81p / wild 2 @xcite .",
    "the crystallization requires temperatures of 1000  k that were found near the sun , while much of the comet is icy and formed at temperatures below 200  k in the outer solar system .",
    "it remains to be seen whether grains can be carried large radial distances in the turbulent surface layers of the protosolar disk without sinking into the undead and dead zones .",
    "we have found that magnetic stresses control the dead zone evolution even with a full complement of micron - sized grains , in a minimum - mass protosolar disk ionized only by stellar x - rays and radionuclide decay .",
    "consequently , smooth large - scale magnetic fields can occur in a wide range of protostellar disks and drive flows in the dead zone before and during planet formation as well as afterwards .",
    "models of the early evolution of the solids in protostellar disks depend crucially on the dynamics of the gas and will be affected by the presence of a laminar midplane accretion flow .",
    "the gas drag forces in turbulence cause collisions between the particles , leading to the growth or destruction of solid bodies depending on the speeds involved @xcite . in laminar gas , grains settle toward the midplane on timescales much less than the disk lifetime @xcite .",
    "layered accretion can cause the rapid formation of large bodies as particles colliding in the turbulent surface layers grow large enough to fall into the laminar interior where destructive collisions are rare @xcite .",
    "protoplanets migrate away from the locations where they first formed , by exchanging orbital angular momentum with the disk gas through gravitational torques @xcite .",
    "the rapid sunward migration of the cores of jupiter and saturn is a difficulty for the standard model of giant planet formation by core accretion @xcite .",
    "the migration rate depends on the distribution of gas near the planet , which can be altered by magnetic forces @xcite .",
    "the midplane magnetic pressure in our calculations reaches a few percent of the gas pressure , sufficient for radial variations to halt or reverse the orbital migration .",
    "the outer edge of the undead zone is a plausible location for radial magnetic gradients large enough to stop the migration , and magnetic effects are a potential solution to the problem of the rapid loss of planetary embryos through migration .",
    "an important question for future studies is how the mass flow rate varies with the distance from the star .",
    "the fraction of the column coupled to the magnetic fields generally increases with the radius .",
    "possibly the inflowing gas will pile up at some location , leading to the development of a local radial pressure maximum @xcite .",
    "if so , gas drag forces push solid particles toward the maximum , providing favorable conditions there for the growth of planetesimals @xcite .",
    "the further build - up of material could lead to self - gravitational instability and an episode of rapid accretion on the star @xcite similar to those associated with intervals of strong mass outflow from young stellar objects @xcite .",
    "part of this work was carried out at the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology using the jpl supercomputing facility and with support from the jpl research and technology development and nasa solar systems origins programs .",
