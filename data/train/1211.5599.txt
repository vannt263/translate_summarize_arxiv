    "@xmath0 bosons are a ubiquitous feature of theories beyond the standard model ( sm ) arising from various bsm scenarios such as @xmath2 gauge extensions of the sm motivated by supersymmetry or grand unified theories , kaluza - klein excitations of sm gauge fields or excitations of composite exotic vector mesons in technicolor theories to name a few .",
    "typically , such resonances are searched for at hadron colliders via the drell - yan ( dy ) production of a lepton pair , i.e. , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 .",
    "the tevatron places limits on the @xmath0 mass , @xmath5 , at around 1 tev  @xcite ( for a sequential @xmath0 ) while the latest lhc limits lie around 2.3 tev  @xcite from this channel .",
    "several phenomenological studies on how to measure the @xmath0 properties and couplings to sm particles in this clean dy channel have been performed .",
    "these proceedings summarise a recently published paper  @xcite addressing the use of the top - antitop final state , i.e. , @xmath6 , to probe these @xmath0 properties .",
    "while it may not have as much ` discovery ' scope as the dy channel , owing to the large qcd background combined with the complex six - body final state and the associated poor reconstruction efficiency , it remains important to extract the couplings of new physics to the top quark .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the top decays before hadronising , transmitting spin information to its decay products , allows for the definition of spin asymmetry observables which provide an extra handle on @xmath0 couplings not present in non - decaying final states .",
    "we study the scope of the lhc to profile a @xmath0 boson mediating @xmath7 production , in both standard kinematic variables as well as spatial / spin asymmetries , by adopting some benchmark scenarios for several realisations of the sequential , left - right symmetric and @xmath8 based @xmath0 models ( specifically , the same as those in  @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , the issue of distinguishability of various models using these observables is addressed .",
    "we define the asymmetry observables considered with the aim of determining their power to discriminate between @xmath0s .",
    "we refer the reader to our paper for a more detailed discussion on these as well as the selection of benchmark models , statistical uncertainties and definitions of significance .",
    "this study investigated charge ( spatial ) and spin asymmetries and their dependence on top couplings to profile and distinguish the models considered .    a selection of charge asymmetry variables",
    "were investigated with the most sensitive found to be @xmath9 , defined by the rapidity difference of the top and antitop , @xmath10 , while also cutting on the boost of the @xmath11 system .",
    "this increases the contribution from the @xmath12 initial state by probing regions of higher partonic momentum fraction , @xmath13 , where its parton luminosity is more important : @xmath14 the two spin asymmetries considered , termed double ( @xmath15 ) and single ( @xmath16 ) , are defined as follows : @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the number of observed events and its first(second ) argument corresponds to the helicity of the top ( anti)quark . these observables are alternatively known as the spin correlation and spin polarisation asymmetries respectively and can be extracted as coefficients in differential angular distributions of the top decay products .",
    "the dependence of the asymmetries on the vector and axial couplings @xmath19 and @xmath20 or alternatively , the left and right handed couplings @xmath21 and @xmath22 of a generic neutral current are shown in  @xcite .",
    "the charge asymmetry depends on the product of the vector and axial couplings of both the initial and final state particle and can only be generated when all of these are non - vanishing .",
    "this is equivalent to measuring the relative magnitudes of their right and left handed couplings of the @xmath23 . for the spin asymmetries ,",
    "@xmath24 depends on the couplings in a similar way to the total cross section , while @xmath25 is only non - vanishing for non - zero vector and axial couplings of the final state tops .",
    "it is additionally sensitive to their relative sign i.e. it measures their relative handedness as with the charge asymmetry but only for the final state .    with these unique coupling dependences ,",
    "it is our aim to show that asymmetries can provide extra information to distinguish @xmath23 models and ultimately contribute to extracting the couplings of an observed neutral resonance .",
    "we present a selection of results profiling the spatial and spin asymmetry distributions of the benchmark @xmath23 models compared to the sm including interference effects .",
    "the set of benchmarks are split into two categories : those with a vanishing vector or axial coupling ( the @xmath26 models with the ` b - l ' generalised left - right symmetric model ) are classed as the ` @xmath26 ' type while the rest , with both couplings non - zero , are referred to as the ` generalised ' models .",
    "the variables described in section  [ sec : defcalc ] were computed as a function of the @xmath11 invariant mass within @xmath27 gev and compared to the tree - level sm predictions .",
    "the code exploited for our study is based on helicity amplitudes , defined through the helas subroutines  @xcite , and built up by means of madgraph  @xcite .",
    "cteq6l1  @xcite parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) were used , with the factorisation / renormalisation scale at @xmath28 .",
    "vegas  @xcite was used for numerical integration .     for the @xmath26-type models and @xmath25 and @xmath29 for the generalised models binned in @xmath30 100 gev either side of @xmath312 tev for the lhc at 14 tev assuming 100 fb@xmath32 of integrated luminosity.,title=\"fig : \" ]   for the @xmath26-type models and @xmath25 and @xmath29 for the generalised models binned in @xmath30 100 gev either side of @xmath312 tev for the lhc at 14 tev assuming 100 fb@xmath32 of integrated luminosity.,title=\"fig : \" ]   for the @xmath26-type models and @xmath25 and @xmath29 for the generalised models binned in @xmath30 100 gev either side of @xmath312 tev for the lhc at 14 tev assuming 100 fb@xmath32 of integrated luminosity.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the asymmetry profiles shown in figure  [ fig : asys ] include statistical uncertainties and fold in an estimated 10% reconstruction efficiency of the @xmath11 pair assuming the use of all possible decay channels .",
    "the figures show that the majority of benchmark models can be distinguished from one another using these variables , noting in particular the sensitivity of @xmath25 to the relative sign of the vector and axial couplings which allows for a clear distinction between the @xmath33 ( sequential ) and @xmath34 ( left - right symmetric ) .",
    "@xmath24 depends on the couplings in the same way as the total cross section and therefore models that can not be distinguished in the invariant mass spectrum will remain so in this observable .",
    "it is clear that @xmath25 is the most powerful observable in that it provides the best distinguishing power along with the extra feature of being sensitive to the handedness of the top couplings .",
    "@xmath9 provides some distinction but the handedness sensitivity is not present for reasons discussed in the previous section .",
    "increasing the @xmath35 mass increases the statistical uncertainties but also slightly raises the central values , both as a consequence of the lower sm background .",
    "table  [ tab : signif_lhc14_al ] shows the significance of @xmath25 between benchmarks assuming 100 fb@xmath32 of integrated luminosity . in almost all cases it is effective in disentangling the ` generalised ' models with the discrimination decreasing slightly for higher masses .",
    "although not shown in these proceedings , a similar statistical analysis was performed in determining how much integrated luminosity would be required to achieve a significance of 3@xmath36 between models using asymmetries .",
    "we showed that in most cases , the models can be distinguished at the relatively early stages of the lhc ( @xmath37  100  fb@xmath32 at 14 tev ) even for the higher mass of 2.5 tev .",
    "the cases where this is not possible reflect mostly instances where the couplings are too similar .",

    "figures refer to @xmath40(500 ) gev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have presented an overview of a phenomenological study on classes of @xmath23 models in both spin and spatial asymmetries of @xmath11 production and showed that there is much scope to observe deviations from the sm and even distinguish between various models , particularly for spin asymmetries .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath11 channel may be a useful complement to the dy channel in the aim of profiling a @xmath0 resonance should one be observed in the near future .",
    "we note that the benchmarks considered are put forward to set bounds on @xmath23 masses and are best probed in the di - lepton channels .",
    "other models could be better suited to the @xmath11 channel , such as leptophobic / top - phillic @xmath23s occurring in composite / multi - site and extra - dimensional models .",
    "the profiling techniques discussed in this study would be even more applicable in these scenarios .    finally ,",
    "although not addressed in the paper to which these proceedings refer , one can ask whether more can be done in profiling an observed resonance with the view of extracting its fermionic couplings . a previous study attempting to do this in the light lepton sector",
    "@xcite finds a degeneracy in determining the quark and lepton couplings which can be solved by considering asymmetries in an alternate final state . in a more recent paper  @xcite",
    ", we show that asymmetry observables in the @xmath11 provide independent information which would break this degeneracy and allow for a fit to all couplings in the ` minimal ' framework of 5 independent couplings used in many benchmarks .",
