    "many driven nonequilibrium systems exhibit complex dynamical behavior characterized by spatiotemporal fluctuations of an intensive parameter @xmath0 which may represent an inverse temperature , a chemical potential ( e.g. , in a system with inhomogeneous concentrations ) , an effective friction constant , the amplitude of a perturbing noise , or the local energy dissipation , as in the case of turbulent flows .",
    "although such systems do not settle to equilibrium , their long - term behavior can often be described in the spirit of equilibrium statistical mechanics by viewing them as consisting of an ensemble of subsystems or `` cells '' to which are associated different values of @xmath0 . if there is local equilibrium in each cell , so that statistical mechanics can be applied locally , and if the fluctuations of @xmath0 evolve on a sufficiently large time scale , then in the long - term run the entire system can be described by a mixture or superposition of different boltzmann factors having different values of @xmath0 .",
    "such a mixture of various statistics has been termed a `` superstatistics '' @xcite and has been the subject of various papers lately ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "many models based on the notion of superstatistics have also been applied successfully to a variety of physical problems , including lagrangian @xcite and eulerian turbulence @xcite , defect turbulence @xcite , cosmic ray statistics @xcite , plasmas @xcite , statistics of wind velocity differences @xcite , and econophysics @xcite .",
    "what is common to all these problems is the experimental observation of stationary distributions having `` fat '' tails .",
    "such distributions fall necessary outside the framework of ordinary statistical mechanics , but not that of superstatistics .",
    "for example , if the random intensive parameter @xmath0 in the various cells is taken to be distributed according to a particular probability distribution , the @xmath1-distribution , then the corresponding superstatistics , obtained by integrating the boltzmann factor @xmath2 over all @xmath0 , yields the nonextensive statistics of tsallis defined by the so - called @xmath3-exponential function @xcite @xmath4^{-1/(q-1)}.\\ ] ] this particular statistics decays as a power - law for large energies @xmath5 rather than an exponential , as is the case for the ordinary boltzmann factor . in this sense , it is a fat - tailed statistics .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 above is related in the superstatistical model to the average inverse temperature of the inhomogeneous system , whereas the so - called entropic index @xmath3 relates to the variance of the @xmath0 fluctuations @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that distributions having the form of a @xmath3-exponential can be obtained formally by maximizing tsallis measure of entropy subject to suitable constraints .",
    "moreover , ordinary statistical mechanics , which correspond in the superstatistics picture to the case where there is no fluctuations in @xmath0 , is recovered in the limit where @xmath7 @xcite .    for other distributions of the intensive parameter @xmath0 ,",
    "one ends up with more general superstatistics .",
    "generalized entropies , which are analogs of the tsallis entropies , can also be defined for these general superstatistics @xcite , and generalized versions of statistical mechanics can be constructed , at least in principle .",
    "it has been shown that the corresponding generalized entropies are stable @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will briefly review the superstatistics concept , and then analyze the asymptotic behavior of general superstatistics for large values of the energy @xmath5 .",
    "we will investigate how the properties of the function @xmath8 , which represents the probability distribution of the intensive variable @xmath0 in the various spatial cells , determine the asymptotic decay rate of the generalized boltzmann factor of the superstatistics .",
    "we develop a saddle - point approximation technique which allows us to treat this problem in full generality .",
    "several examples will be worked out in detail to show that the asymptotic decay rate of the stationary distributions resulting from @xmath8 can not only be a power - law , as in the case of nonextensive statistics , but can also be an exponential of the square root of the energy or , generally , a stretched exponential .",
    "we will discuss universal aspects of the large energy asymptotics , thus complementing the consideration in ref .",
    "@xcite where universal aspects of the low - energy behavior of general superstatistics were discussed .",
    "the large energy asymptotics is of particular physical importance because the tails of the observed distributions measured in various experiments ( e.g. , hydrodynamic turbulence @xcite , plasmas @xcite , and granular media @xcite ) can distinguish between the various possible types of superstatistics .",
    "let us first briefly review the superstatistics concept as introduced in ref .",
    "consider a driven nonequilibrium system with spatiotemporal fluctuations of an intensive parameter @xmath0 , for example , the inverse temperature .",
    "locally , i.e. ,  in spatial regions ( cells ) where @xmath0 is approximately constant , the system is described by ordinary statistical mechanics , i.e. , by  an ordinary boltzmann factor @xmath2 , where @xmath5 is an effective energy in each cell . in the long - term run ,",
    "the system is described by a spatiotemporal average over the fluctuating @xmath0 . in this way",
    ", one may define an effective boltzmann factor @xmath9 for the whole system as @xmath10 where @xmath8 is the normalized probability distribution describing the @xmath0-fluctuations in the various cells .",
    "for so - called type - a superstatistics , one normalizes this effective boltzmann factor and obtains the stationary , long - term probability distribution , @xmath11 where @xmath12 for type - b superstatistics , the @xmath0-dependent normalization constant of each local boltzmann factor is included into the averaging process . in this case",
    ", the invariant long - term distribution is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the normalization constant of the boltzmann factor @xmath2 for a given @xmath0 .",
    "both approaches can be easily mapped into each other by considering a new probability density @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a normalization constant .",
    "one immediately recognizes that type - b superstatistics with @xmath17 is equivalent to type - a superstatistics with @xmath18 .",
    "as mentioned before , the fluctuations of the intensive parameter @xmath19 are spatiotemporal : they can be produced by either temporal changes of the environment or by the movement of a test particle through inhomogeneous spatial regions . the precise nature and behavior of @xmath19 in these situations",
    "can be quite varied .",
    "in our general description of superstatistics , we have taken @xmath19 to be an inverse temperature which varies randomly in time or in space , but @xmath19 can also represent , say , a chemical potential that varies smoothly in space . in this way",
    ", one may study superstatistical models where the fluctuations of @xmath19 are caused by large - scale temperature gradients in a system @xcite or by a nonuniform chemical potential describing inhomogeneous concentrations spread in space .    from a more dynamical perspective",
    ", a superstatistics can also be achieved by considering langevin equations whose parameters fluctuate on a relatively large time scale ( the adiabatic regime @xcite ) ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for details . for turbulence applications , for example ,",
    "one may consider a superstatistical extension of the sawford model of lagrangian turbulence @xcite .",
    "this model consists of suitable stochastic differential equations for the position , velocity , and acceleration of a lagrangian test particle in the turbulent flow .",
    "the superstatistical extension naturally enters due to the fact that the local energy dissipation rate in turbulent flows is a random variable .",
    "thus the parameters of the sawford model become random variables as well .",
    "these kinds of models well reproduce experimentally measured turbulence data @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will use the notation of type - a superstatistics , keeping in mind that we can always proceed to type - b superstatistics by replacing @xmath17 by @xmath18 .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to positive values of @xmath0 and @xmath5 and will assume , in addition , that @xmath8 is everywhere differentiable and unimodal ( single - bell - shaped curve ) .",
    "we recall the low - energy asymptotics of superstatistics for reasons of completeness ; it was previously discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . consider a distribution @xmath8 having mean @xmath20 and variance @xmath21 using the definition of @xmath9 , we can write @xmath22 then , expanding in taylor series the exponential term inside the expected value , we obtain @xmath23 thus , to second order in @xmath5 , @xmath9 must behave like @xmath24 as @xmath25 .",
    "this approximation represents the leading order correction to ordinary statistical mechanics in our nonhomogeneous system with temperature fluctuations for small values of the energy @xmath5 .",
    "the zeroth - order approximation to @xmath9 corresponds , as is expected , to the `` pure '' boltzmann statistics , @xmath26 with inverse temperature @xmath27 .",
    "it can be noted that these two asymptotic results can also be considered to be valid approximations of @xmath28 in the limit where @xmath29 for all @xmath30 , that is essentially when @xmath31 ( small fluctuations limit ) .",
    "to find the high - energy asymptotics of @xmath9 , we use the fact that the integral defining @xmath9 has the form of a laplace integral for @xmath32 @xcite . in this limit , the integral can be approximated by its largest integrand .",
    "this is the essence of laplace method , otherwise known as the saddle - point approximation @xcite .",
    "the conditions of applicability of this approximation method are basically the conditions that we have assumed regarding the shape of @xmath8 and its differentiability .",
    "thus , putting @xmath9 in the form @xmath33 we attempt to locate the largest integrand by finding the unique value of @xmath0 which maximizes the exponent function , @xmath34 for any large enough energy value @xmath5 .",
    "we call the value of @xmath0 maximizing @xmath35 for fixed @xmath5 the _ dominant inverse temperature _ and denote it by @xmath36 .",
    "the fact that @xmath8 is assumed to be unimodal ensures us that @xmath36 is unique , as required .",
    "indeed , observe that @xmath37 must be a concave function of @xmath0 if @xmath8 is unimodal ( see fig .  1 ) , and , in this case",
    ", the maximum of @xmath35 along the @xmath0-direction can only be attained at a single point @xmath36 which is such that @xmath38^{\\prime } = \\frac{f^{\\prime } ( \\beta ) } { f(\\beta ) } .",
    "\\label{leg1}\\ ] ] solving this equation for @xmath0 , we find @xmath36 and thus write @xmath39 in the limit where @xmath32 .",
    "note that this basic laplace or saddle - point approximation of @xmath9 can be improved a bit more by evaluating the integral defining @xmath9 using a gaussian approximation of the integrand @xcite .",
    "what results from this more refined approximation is the following high - energy asymptotics : @xmath40^{\\prime \\prime } } }   \\label{app2}\\ ] ] which differs from the laplace approximation only by the square - root term involving the curvature of @xmath37 .",
    "the laplace approximation of @xmath9 as well as its gaussian corrected version shown above are quite interesting from the physical point of view because they show that the mixture of boltzmann statistics defining @xmath9 reduces at high energy @xmath5 to a `` pure '' boltzmann statistics , just like in the equilibrium situation , although now the boltzmann statistics involves an inverse temperature @xmath36 which depends on the energy @xmath5 considered .",
    "this means that , for high values of @xmath5 , the long - term , stationary behavior of the nonequilibrium system considered is dominated by the equilibrium behavior of a subset of cells having an inverse temperature equal or close to @xmath36 . how @xmath36 changes as a function of @xmath5 is determined from the properties of @xmath8 . in the general case considered here , where @xmath37 concave , we find that @xmath41 when @xmath32 ( see fig .  1 ) . thus in this case",
    "the large - energy behavior of the generalized boltzmann factors @xmath9 is determined by the small-@xmath0 ( high temperature ) behavior of the function @xmath8 .    to complete this section , note that the exponent function @xmath42 which enters in the asymptotics of @xmath9 represents nothing but the legendre transform of @xmath37 .",
    "the result of this transform is a function of @xmath5 which can be thought of to represent , following the theory of large deviations @xcite , an entropy function if we consider that the function @xmath37 represents a free energy function .",
    "this entropy function , however , is just a formal one and is unrelated to the tsallis entropies or other generalized entropies as defined in refs .",

    "consider first an @xmath8 with @xmath46 , @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
