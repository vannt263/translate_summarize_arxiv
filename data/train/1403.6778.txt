    "seeking localized solutions to ( non- ) linear differential equations has a very long history , starting probably with the famous observation by john scott russell of a solitary wave in the union canal @xcite .",
    "since then , many a research were made .",
    "an interest to the theoretical study of localized solutions of linear equations was renewed after the discovery of lasers and further progress in technologies of emitting ultra - short pulses . nowadays , there are also numerous potential applications of such solutions , for example , for the localized low - loss energy transmission , communication , medical imaging or remote sensing .",
    "the state of the art in this field , along with its history , is presented in recent books @xcite .    in free space ( or non - dispersive media ) the problems of wave propagation are usually described using the wave equation ( we ) [ wave - eq ] ^2_t- = 0 , where @xmath0 , etc . ,",
    "and @xmath1 is three dimensional laplace operator . here and throughout the paper we put the constant of speed of light equal to unity , @xmath2 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the waves in dispersive medium are often described by the klein ",
    "gordon  fock equation ( kgfe ) [ kgfe ] ( + m^2 ) u = 0 , where @xmath3 is a mass parameter having different physical meaning in different systems .",
    "the kgfe is important in studying of electromagnetic waves in the isotropic cold collisionless plasma @xcite , waves of charge density in drude metals , or the high - frequency acoustic waves in the gas of charged particles treated in the hydrodynamic approach @xcite .",
    "a relatively recent spike in activity in investigating localized solutions was promoted by the paper by brittingham @xcite , who outlined a new one  parametric family of beam - like localized explicit solutions to the we which he named the focus wave mode ( fwm , which we also call the gaussian beam ) .",
    "this solution is localized in the gaussian way along a straight line in space and has infinite energy .",
    "this solution can not be obtained by the separation of variables in coordinates @xmath4 and time .",
    "however introduction of new variables [ albe ] = z -t , = z + t , where @xmath5 is coordinate along the propagation axis , enables one to do this .",
    "the kgf analogue of the brittingham fwm for the we was given by ziolkowski in @xcite by the separation of variables ( [ albe ] ) .",
    "in @xcite he also suggested to seek other solutions as weighted superpositions over a free parameter of fwm and in doing so he obtained a solution of finite energy and a power ",
    "law localization .",
    "another way of construction of highly localized solutions , the so called bidirectional representation , is based on the fourier integral in new variables ( [ albe ] ) .",
    "taking the fourier weight in the proper way besieres , shaarawi and ziolkowski @xcite , donelly and ziolkowski @xcite found new solutions with finite energy of we and kgfe respectively .",
    "all highly localized solutions both for the we and for kgfe spread propagating .",
    "there were found however the so called undispersive solutions , which propagate without spreading , but have a power - law localization from their moving amplitude maximum . for the we these are the bessel beams , solutions found by durnin @xcite by separation of variables in initial space - time coordinates , and the x  waves found by weighted superposition of bessel beams @xcite . for the kgfe solutions the same property",
    "is possessed by mackinnon s solution @xcite which can be found by combination of the separation of variables and the lorentz transformations .    the particle  like exact solution to the we which decreases exponentially in all directions away from a point moving along a straight line was first presented by kiselev and perel in @xcite .",
    "perel and sidorenko @xcite considered this solution from the point of view of wavelet analysis , investigated numerically the uncertainty relation for this solution and found explicitly its fourier transform . in @xcite",
    "the solution was also analyzed from the point of view of complex sources .",
    "it was shown that it can be generated by a pulse source moving with the speed of wave propagation .",
    "an integral representation of this solution in terms of gaussian beams due to ideas of @xcite was given by perel and fialkovsky in the paper @xcite which was however mainly devoted to the kgfe . in @xcite",
    "it was also suggested a class of explicit exponentially localized packet - like solutions for kgfe and investigated some of their properties .",
    "one of solutions from the class obtained in @xcite coincides with one from @xcite .",
    "kiselev , plachenov and chamorro - posada @xcite created astigmatic beam - like and packet - like solutions of the we .",
    "finally , we shall also mention the work by overfelt @xcite who got a class of solutions which generalizes gaussian beams of @xcite and the bessel beams of @xcite and which have better localization near the propagation axis than gaussian beams . in besieres ,",
    "shaarawi and ziolkowksi @xcite there was suggested a new method of design of solutions of three dimensional kgfe reducing them to a solution of one dimensional kgfe equation with new time and coordinate containing an arbitrary function . on this way they found the counterparts of the gauss ",
    "bessel pulses @xcite and some other solutions .",
    "intrerested reader can find more detialed refences and discussion of various constructions of the localized solutions both for the we and the kgfe in books @xcite and reviews @xcite .",
    "the present work is a continuation of works @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we present nonseparable solutions with exponential localization , both beam - like and particle - like ones .",
    "the former solutions have gaussian localization near a straight line and traveling wave - fronts .",
    "the latter ones in addition to localization near a line are localized in a gaussian manner near a point moving along this line .",
    "the structure of the paper is following . in the next section",
    "we revisit known results on exact exponentially localized solutions for the wave equation . by doing so",
    ", we also construct the astigmatic generalizations of the known beam  like and particle  like solutions for the we .",
    "in section [ kgfeqn ] we apply the developed methods to the construction of the multidimensional astigmatic solutions to the klein  gordon  fock equation .",
    "we proceed by asymptotic investigation of the kgf solutions in section [ asyinv_sect ] where we consider both small / moderate and large times regimes and discuss the choice of parameters which enable us to govern the localization properties of solutions .",
    "we conclude our research by obtaining the fourier transformation of all constructed families of solutions in section [ fourier - analysis ] , and by providing some final remarks and numerical studies of the solutions in section [ discu_sec ] . in appendix [ asymptotic - kgf ] we present the asymptotic investigation of obtained solutions in the fourier domain .",
    "all our results are valid for the space  time with any number of spatial dimensions .",
    "in this section we construct a generalizations of the known localized exact solutions to the we _ t^2 - _ n = 0 , [ wave - eqn ] where @xmath6 stands for @xmath7 dimensional laplacian operator . by doing",
    "so we also revive the necessary techniques to be used also for the klein  gordon  fock equation . in constructing particle  like solutions of the wave equation",
    ", we follow the idea by ziolkowski @xcite and seek such solutions in the form of a superposition of gaussian beams .",
    "the exponentially localized solutions we are focusing on may be considered as `` relatively undistorted progressive waves '' by courant and hilbert @xcite , or `` nondispersive waves '' by hillion @xcite .",
    "they are of the form of a ray series which comprises one term only = g(,t)f ( ) , [ rel - dist]where @xmath8 is a solution of the eikonal equation for we ( _ t)^2 - ( ) ^2 = 0 , [ eikon ] function @xmath9 depends on the form of @xmath8 and satisfies two equations ( _ t)(_tg_0 ) - , g_0 + g_0 = 0 , ( _ t g)^2 - ( g)^2 = 0 , [ transp2 ] and @xmath10 is an arbitrary function . here",
    "@xmath11 .",
    "the focus wave modes by brittingham @xcite belonging to the so called bateman  hillion class are based on the following eikonal @xcite = + , = ( _ , z ) , [ theta ] where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are defined in ( [ albe ] ) , and @xmath15 is an arbitrary positive constant .",
    "the function @xmath9 in this case is of the form @xmath16 , @xmath17 . choosing the arbitrary function @xmath10 as a pure exponent @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a positive parameter we obtain fwm @xcite , or gaussian beam , which reads = .",
    "[ britkis ] we separated imaginary and real parts in the exponent to stress exponential localization of the solution near @xmath5-axis , with @xmath20 we denote the width of the beam in all transverse directions .",
    "such axisymmetric solutions are called the _",
    "stigmatic _ ones .",
    "one of the obvious but far reaching generalizations of the solution is achieved by formal linear transformation of the transverse coordinates in the eikonal function @xmath8 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) [ theta ] = + ( _ , ( ) _ ) , where @xmath21 is a @xmath22 complex matrix depending on @xmath14 , whose properties are to be discussed later .",

    "function @xmath32 has no singularities if @xmath33 does not have nonzero real eigenvalues , and it has the gaussian localization around the axis @xmath5 if the matrix @xmath34 is positively defined .",
    "both conditions are fulfilled if @xmath33 has a positive definite imaginary part .",
    "indeed , the regularity condition is fulfilled since @xmath35 for all nonzero vectors @xmath36 ( real or complex ) including eigenvectors of @xmath33 and hence all its eigenvalues have positive imaginary parts . to show the localization of solution for all values of @xmath14 we note that once @xmath37 has negative definite imaginary part , @xmath38 is also negative definite matrix",
    ". then @xmath39 stays positively defined for all @xmath40 .",
    "we remind here that positive definiteness of @xmath41 and negative definiteness of @xmath42 are equivalent : @xmath43 , where @xmath44 .    the axisymmetrical stigmatic beam ( [ britkis ] )",
    "may be obtained from ( [ wavebeam ] ) if @xmath45 ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 are real constants ) .",
    "the width of the gaussian curve in the transverse direction depends in this case on the propagation direction @xmath5 and time . for fixed time",
    "the width has a minimum which is called a waist .",
    "the simplest non - axisymmetrical solutions , the _ aligned simple astigmatic _ ones , correspond to a diagonal @xmath21matrix : @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 being real constants , @xmath51 .",
    "when @xmath27 can be diagonalized by a orthogonal rotation of axes the solutions are called _ rotated simple astigmatic_. in two  dimensional case it is given by [ g0-matr ] = * u * * * * u*^-1 , = (    cc & - + &    ) , = (    cc & 0 + 0 &    ) .",
    "the level surfaces of the modulus of aligned ( and rotated ) simple astigmatic solution in the transverse space are ellipsoids ( ellipses if the whole space is three  dimensional ) .",

    "then the main axes of the ellipsoids ( or hyperboloids ) of constant phase and of modulus levels rotate with time and/or coordinate @xmath5 .",
    "the absolute value of the total angle of rotation is equal to @xmath54 for both of them ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
