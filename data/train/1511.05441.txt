    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite proposes a duality between gauge theories at the boundary of an asymptotically ads spacetime and quantum gravity in the bulk .",
    "this correspondence has been turned into a powerful tool and has also been suggested to provide a definition of quantum gravity through the dual theory on the boundary .",
    "other approaches such as loop quantum gravity @xcite and spin foams @xcite aim at defining directly a theory of quantum gravity without using an ( asymptotic ) background .",
    "an interesting question is therefore whether these non  perturbative approaches are compatible with ads / cft @xcite or other forms of duality . for further work related to this question see @xcite",
    "this work explores this question in the context of 3d gravity without a cosmological constant .",
    "the exploration of ads / cft duality in the context of e.g. loop quantum gravity has been hindered by mainly two issues : firstly the construction of models incorporating a negative cosmological constant is much more involved than models with vanishing or positive cosmological constants , but recent progress can be found in @xcite .",
    "these complications can be avoided by turning to a generalization of the ads / cft duality to asymptotically flat gravity , which has been considered in @xcite . in particular",
    "@xcite computes the one  loop partition function with a torus boundary at asymptotic infinity , showing that it is given by the character of a representation of the bms group @xcite , which is the asymptotic symmetry group of gravity without a cosmological constant .",
    "this shows also that the one  loop partition function gives actually the exact result , i.e. that all higher order corrections vanish ( for asymptotically flat boundary data ) .",
    "secondly and more importantly , it is very involved and to some extend goes against the philosophy of background independent approaches , to impose asymptotic boundary conditions .",
    "indeed , partition functions for _ finite _ regions are central in formulating and understanding the theory @xcite and do encode the complete dynamics of the theory @xcite .",
    "such partition functions for finite regions are actually unavoidable in non  perturbative approaches : the size of the region is encoded in the boundary data on which the partition function depends .",
    "thus an asymptotic limit means to consider the partition function only for certain , very special types of boundary data , which do not encode the full dynamics of the theory .",
    "the aim we pursue here is to obtain the partition function for boundary data describing a finite region . in the example described here ,",
    "3d flat gravity with a torus boundary , we will nevertheless find a result consistent with the one expected due to the bms symmetry of flat gravity and we will also identify a dual field theory , generalizing results found for ads gravity @xcite to the flat case .",
    "as mentioned one aim pursued here is to prepare the ground for calculations of the ( finite region ) partition functions in non  perturbative approaches .",
    "these often involve discretizations and we thus turn to a discrete approach , regge calculus @xcite . here",
    "it is so far not possible to treat the quantum partition function analytically for the full non  linear theory  at least not in the incarnation known as quantum regge calculus @xcite  however the linear theory can be straightforwardly handled and  at least for the asymptotic case  is expected to give the exact result .",
    "3d gravity and also 3d ( classical ) regge gravity is a topological theory  there are no propagating degrees of freedom . to make it also a topological , and for 3d regge calculus , triangulation invariant theory in the quantum realm , one needs to identify the correct path integral measure .",
    "such a measure is not known for the original quantum regge calculus , but has been identified for the linearized theory in @xcite .",
    "the ponzano ",
    "regge model @xcite can be seen as a quantization of regge calculus based on a first order formulation of gravity ( which happens to coincide with @xmath0 bf theory ) . as it is ( at least formally )",
    "invariant under changes of triangulation @xcite , it also has a triangulation invariant measure built in . in the semiclassical",
    "limit it moreover coincides with the one found in @xcite .",
    "the ponzano ",
    "regge model is the first example of a spin foam model .",
    "we expect the work in this paper to help consider the partition function for the ponzano  regge model on the solid torus and to examine possible dual field theories in a fully non  perturbative set  up .",
    "we can thus make use of the fact that 3d regge calculus is a topological field theory .",
    "this allows us to work with the coarsest bulk triangulation possible , which simplifies the calculations drastically and moreover will lead to a very geometric interpretation of the result .",
    "another issue is the boundary triangulation . on the one hand",
    "this can be seen as a regulator .",
    "indeed we will see that , despite working with a topological theory , the hamilton ",
    "jacobi functional can be described by a ( dual ) field theory with propagating degrees of freedom on the boundary . to this end",
    "we have to take the continuum limit for the boundary discretization . on the other hand",
    "the discrete boundary can also be seen as a particular choice of boundary data for the continuum theory , where the boundary metric is piecewise flat @xcite . in this case",
    "the dual field theory comes in the form of a lattice theory , does however give the exact result for this kind of piecewise flat boundary data .",
    "this work will show that discrete approaches are indeed useful for the exploration of holography .",
    "the calculation of the one  loop determinant performed here is much simpler than in the continuum and makes direct use of the topological nature of the theory . as mentioned a crucial issue",
    "is to be able to work at finite boundary , for which we here provide a proof of concept .",
    "often one rather employs an asymptotic expansion , e.g. the fefferman  graham expansion @xcite , starting from the metric at infinity , for instance in @xcite .",
    "in contrast , here we identify the induced boundary theory for a finite boundary ( for linearized gravity ) .",
    "indeed in the case of 3d flat gravity it will turn out that it is not even necessary to take the asymptotic limit to validate the one  loop correction .",
    "moreover we provide an explicit example of a discrete model leading to a boundary field theory . a related concept",
    "are mera tensor networks , designed to describe conformal field theories @xcite .",
    "recently a connection of these networks to ads / cft duality ( or other forms of duality ) has been proposed and explored @xcite .",
    "the discretization employed here can also be seen as a generalized tensor network ( in particular as a decorated tensor network introduced in @xcite ) .",
    "the dynamics incorporates directly 3d gravity and leads indeed to a field theory on the boundary . due to the topological nature of the theory ,",
    "the connectivity of the network , given by the choice of ( bulk ) discretization , is not important .",
    "this feature does reflect the diffeomorphism invariance of the theory @xcite , an issue that so far is left open in the context of the mera approach to ads / cft . as we will discuss",
    "we can choose a discretization that emulates a mera network and thus provide a model with a direct connection to gravity .",
    "+ in section [ reviewb ] we provide a short review of the work @xcite , which computes the one  loop partition function for 3d gravity with vanishing cosmological constant and torus boundary . to prepare for the corresponding computation in a discrete set  up and for finite boundary we summarize all the necessary ingredients of regge calculus in section [ sec : regge ] .",
    "a particular important role will be played by the diffeomorphism invariance of the theory , discussed in section [ sec : diff ] .",
    "we construct the partition function for regge calculus in section [ sec : pd ] , which we then calculate in section [ sec : int ] .",
    "in particular section [ sec : loop ] discusses the one  loop determinant and gives a geometric interpretation of its structure . in section [ sec : eff ] we extract the hamilton ",
    "jacobi functional , or effective boundary action ( for the linearized theory and ) for inhomogeneous boundary data and we perform the continuum limit in section [ sec : climit ] . in section [ sec : l ] we conjecture and test a dual field theory on the boundary .",
    "this dual field theory is coupled to the boundary curvature and integrating out the dual field will give the part of the effective boundary action which is invariant under linearized boundary diffeomorphisms .",
    "this part is also responsible for the dependence of the one  loop determinant on the topological parameters of the torus .",
    "finally we confirm our calculation of the effective boundary action in the discrete by computing the effective boundary action directly in the continuum theory in section [ sec : cont ] . in section [ outlook ]",
    "we discuss two issues left for further work : one is the use of different discretizations , in particular one that relates to mera tensor networks .",
    "such discretizations also allow to perform a continuum limit in the bulk which would be necessary to consider for non  topological theories , for instance if one considers gravity coupled to matter .",
    "another issue discussed is the use of alternative boundary terms and conditions .",
    "we close the paper with a discussion in section [ discussion ] .",
    "in @xcite the one  loop partition function of three  dimensional gravity without cosmological constant is computed .",
    "the boundary has the topology of the torus and the boundary data coincide with asymptotic boundary condition prescribing a geometry known as thermal spinning flat space @xcite .",
    "this is a 3d flat spacetime [ metric0 ] ds^2&= & dr^2 + dt^2 + r^2 dwith periodic identification @xmath1 in addition to the usual identification @xmath2 for the angular variable .",
    "if we consider the spacetime for @xmath3 we obtain a solid torus with contractible cycles given by @xmath4 and non ",
    "contractible cycles along the @xmath5 lines .",
    "the torus can be obtained by identifying the top and bottom discs of a cylinder of height @xmath6 , with a twisting angle ( or angular potential ) @xmath7 .    to compute the one  loop partition function one needs to evaluate the ( euclidean ) einstein  hilbert action with boundary term [ ehaction ] s_eh&=&- d^3 x r + b on the solution . in this work",
    "we choose as boundary term the standard gibbons  hawking  york term @xcite [ ghy ] b_ghy&= & - d^2 y k with @xmath8 the induced metric on the boundary and @xmath9 the trace of the intrinsic curvature .",
    "note that @xcite uses a boundary term @xmath10 instead .",
    "the use of this boundary term has been justified in @xcite in the asymptotic limit @xmath11 and comes from the fall - off conditions on the metric coefficients at infinity .",
    "it is this choice @xmath12 of boundary term that realizes the relation of the partition function to the bms vacuum character .",
    "we will however stick here to @xmath13 .",
    "the reason is our strategy to work with a boundary at finite radius , for which @xmath13 is the correct boundary term .",
    "in addition , regge calculus deeply relies on using the @xmath13 term : the actions for single building blocks coincide with the continuum action evaluated on chunks of flat spacetime with piecewise flat boundaries .",
    "we will also see that the one  loop correction is not affected by the choice of boundary term .",
    "we will comment on the possible use of @xmath12 in the context of regge calculus in the outlook section [ outlook ] .",
    "the bulk action vanishes on solutions and thus the zeroth order of the partition function is given by the boundary term .",
    "the trace of the extrinsic curvature for a @xmath14 surface in the metric is given by @xmath15 , which together with @xmath16 leads to a term proportional to the area of the torus at unit radius @xmath17 , and hence a @xmath18-independent , finite result . together with all constants we have b_ghy= - .",
    "the one  loop correction is given by evaluating the determinant of the second order fluctuation matrix of the action , expanded around the given background .",
    "such a one  loop correction has been found first for the ads case @xcite using heat kernel techniques . in @xcite",
    "the same strategy is followed : after including the appropriate gauge  fixing and ghost terms , the one  loop partition correction can be written as s^(1 ) = - _ ( 2 ) + _ ( 1 ) - _ ( 0 ) where @xmath19 for @xmath20 are the laplacians for the traceless transverse , the vector , and the scalar mode of a symmetric @xmath21 matrix .",
    "the determinants can be found using the heat kernel approach . to this end",
    "one needs to find the solutions of the heat kernel equations corresponding to the laplacians @xmath19 on the background under considerations .",
    "the heat kernels are known for flat space of topology @xmath22 .",
    "one can obtain the heat kernels for the thermal spinning spacetime by applying the method of images , which sums the @xmath22 kernels over the images of the discrete symmetry group generated by the mapping @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore one performs a regularization by adding a mass term to the heat kernels , which is then removed in the final result .",
    "collecting the three contributions for the various modes , this sum ( originating from the sum over images ) takes the form [ continuums1 ] s^(1)=_n=1^ ( + ) where @xmath24 with a further regulating parameter @xmath25 . after rewriting the exponential of this sum",
    ", the one  loop partition function can be expressed as [ z1 ] z ( , ) = e^- ^_k=2 + o ( ) . for the choice of boundary term @xmath26 this reproduces the 3d vacuum bsm character constructed in @xcite .",
    "our aim is to reproduce the one  loop correction in the setup of regge calculus , using a boundary at finite radius . whereas the nature of 3d gravity as a topological theory is rather hidden in the continuum computation ,",
    "we will make direct use of it .",
    "this will make the structure of the result ( [ z1 ] ) transparent .",
    "it shows that the one  loop contribution can be understood as arising from degrees of freedom residing at the boundary of the spacetime , which are equipped with a kinetic term @xmath27 .",
    "the one  loop correction arises as the determinant of @xmath28 on the boundary torus , where the integer @xmath29 in ( [ z1 ] ) is found to be the momentum ( fourier ) mode in angular direction .",
    "we will also show that the product in ( [ z1 ] ) starts with @xmath30 due to diffeomorphism symmetry .",
    "it indeed cancels out the @xmath31 and @xmath32 modes .",
    "these findings motivate us to search in section [ sec : l ] for a dual field theory describing the boundary fluctuations ( after integrating out the bulk variables ) , which can be understood to be responsible for the one  loop correction .",
    "in this section we provide a short review of regge calculus and collect all material necessary to be able to calculate the partition function for the linearized theory .",
    "an important role is played by a discrete notion of diffeomorphism symmetry extant in 3d regge calculus , which we also present .      in regge calculus one",
    "replaces the smooth manifold @xmath33 with a triangulation @xmath34 .",
    "the metric data are then encoded by an assignment of length variables @xmath35 to the edges @xmath36 of the triangulation @xmath34 .",
    "this specifies a piecewise flat and linear geometry for @xmath34 .",
    "the solutions of the theory are determined by varying the 3d regge action [ regge1 ] s_r&= & - _ e ^ l_e _ e - _ e l_e _ e . here",
    "the first sum is over all bulk edges of @xmath34 and involves the deficit angles [ regge2 ] _ e(l_e)&= & 2- _ e _",
    "e^(l_e ) , which measure the curvature concentrated on a given edge @xmath36 .",
    "the angle @xmath37 is the interior dihedral angle at the edge @xmath36 in the tetrahedron @xmath38 .",
    "it is a function of the six edge lengths of @xmath38 .",
    "the second sum in ( [ regge1 ] ) corresponds to the gibbons  hawking  york boundary term in ( [ ehaction ] ) and involves the boundary angles [ regge3 ] _ e(l_e)&= & - _ e _",
    "e^(l_e ) , which now measure the extrinsic curvature .",
    "this ( discrete equivalent of the gibbons  hawking  york ) boundary term makes the variational principle well defined for the action with fixed boundary edge lengths @xcite . indeed , due to the schlfli identity [ schlaefli ] _",
    "e^=0 one can show that the variations @xmath39 vanish , if varying the regge action ( [ regge1 ] ) .",
    "one thus obtains the equations of motion [ regge5 ] 0 & & 8 g _ e s_r = - _ e , demanding  as one expects in 3d gravity  vanishing curvature . as we will later comment these equations",
    "might not fix the edge length in the bulk uniquely , a feature that leads to a discrete notion of diffeomorphism symmetry @xcite .",
    "this non  uniqueness does however not matter for finding hamilton  jacobi functional ( or hamilton s principal function or effective boundary action ) , that is for evaluating the action on the solution .",
    "the equation of motions make the bulk term vanish and we are left with the evaluation of the boundary term [ regge6 ] s_r_| = - _ e l_e _ e(l_e_| ) .",
    "thus hamilton s principal function coincides with the ( integrated ) extrinsic curvature of a piecewise flat 2d surface embedded into flat 3d space .",
    "note that in this case hamilton s principal function is independent of any choice of bulk triangulation : the bulk triangulation is only needed as an auxiliary construction to determine the embedding of the 2d boundary surface into flat 3d space .",
    "triangulation independence of local actions leads to theories without propagating ( non  topological ) degrees of freedom , that is correspond to perfect discretizations of topological theories ( see eg .",
    "thus regge calculus is a perfect discretization of 3d gravity @xcite , that is it captures exactly the continuum properties of this ( topological ) theory .",
    "let us also remark that the embedding of the 2d surface into flat spacetime and therefore hamilton s principal function might not be uniquely defined .",
    "here we refer to relative embedding information : that is even if we fix the position of all the neighbouring vertices of a certain vertex @xmath40 , the position of @xmath40 itself might not be unique .",
    "these are however discrete ambiguities , and are indeed connected to the sum over spacetime orientations in the ponzano  regge action .",
    "note that we can rewrite the regge action as a sum over tetrahedra ( plus terms that will not contribute to the hessian of the action ) [ regge7 ] 8 g s_r & = & -_e ^ 2l_e- _ e l_e + _ s_where [ regge8 ] s_- _ e l_e & = & _ e",
    "l_e _ l_e - _ e l_e gives hamilton s principal function for the boundary data of a tetrahedron .",
    "this hamilton s principal function does coincide with the continuum hamilton s function if one understands the boundary metric to be piecewise flat and extrinsic curvature to be distributional concentrated on the edges of the tetrahedron .",
    "thus hamilton s principal function for a tetrahedron is also invariant under any ( bulk ) refinements of the tetrahedron .",
    "the linearized theory is described by expanding the regge action to quadratic order in perturbations @xmath41 : [ regge9 ] s^(2)&= & _ e , e _ | l_e = l_e _ e _ e + & = & _ e , e _ e , e _",
    "|l_e = l_e _ e _ e . here schlfli identity ( [ schlaefli ] ) guarantees that @xmath42",
    ".    bulk triangulation independence of the full action ( or rather hamilton s principal function ) does also extend to the linearized case @xcite .",
    "the topological nature of 3d continuum gravity and also its discrete incarnation in the form of regge calculus is due to gauge symmetries which reduce the field variables to a few topological degrees of freedom .",
    "gauge symmetries lead to non  uniqueness of solutions . in the case of regge calculus",
    "we can easily understand this non  uniqueness : given a solution with bulk vertices we know that this solution is 3d flat .",
    "we obtain a physically equivalent solution by displacing the position of a given bulk vertex in the embedding flat 3d space .",
    "this displacement will lead to a change in the length of the edges connected to the vertex , but clearly not to a change of the geometric properties of the bulk space .",
    "these symmetries have been discussed in @xcite . for 4d",
    "the status of gauge symmetries depends on the solution : a vertex embedded in a flat piece of space can be displaced whereas it has been shown in @xcite that diffeomorphism symmetry is broken for solutions with curvature .    the diffeomorphism symmetry in the discrete is closely connected to ( bulk ) triangulation independence @xcite : if we can displace vertices one can also move a vertex on top of another vertex which leads to a coarse  graining of the triangulation .",
    "this shows that the coarse  graining of the triangulation does not change hamilton s principal function .    for the linearized action the gauge symmetries result in null vectors for the associated hessian matrix .",
    "we thus expect three null vectors for every bulk vertex .",
    "there is a further ( global ) null vector we can expect , resulting from the schlfli identity .",
    "as one can see from ( [ regge9 ] ) each tetrahedron @xmath38 contributes [ diffeo1 ] h_ee^:= , h_ee=_e , e h_ee^ . due to the schlfli identity ( [ schlaefli ] ) the hessian for a tetrahedron has a null vector which extends to a null vector for the full triangulation hessian ( including boundary terms ! ) : _",
    "e h_ee^l_e = 0 _ e h_ee l_e = 0 .",
    "the null vectors correspond to a scaling symmetry @xmath43 .",
    "indeed , going back to the full theory , if one multiplies all edge lengths of the solutions with a scaling factor , one again obtains a solution ( with also rescaled boundary data ) .",
    "the full hamilton ",
    "jacobi functional and also action is however not invariant  it rather is multiplied by the same scaling factor .",
    "one can argue @xcite that the combination of null vectors corresponding to scaling symmetry for each tetrahedron lead to the null vectors corresponding to diffeomorphism symmetry .      in quantum regge calculus @xcite",
    "one considers the path integral [ formalpfregge ] z= ( l ) ( - s_r ) integrating over the lengths of the bulk edges in the triangulation with some measure @xmath44 .",
    "there has been considerable debate in the literature on the measure for quantum regge calculus @xcite .",
    "one difficulty that makes any analytical calculations hard are the triangle inequalities that make determining the integration range very complicated .",
    "we avoid this issue by considering linearized regge calculus and integrating the length perturbations over @xmath45 as in standard perturbative quantum field theory .    in 3d ,",
    "given the invariance properties of the classical action , one can demand that the same invariances should hold at least to one  loop order ( for the linearized theory ) .",
    "indeed it has been shown in @xcite that invariance under changes of the bulk triangulation does fix the measure of 3d regge calculus uniquely .",
    "this measure term does furthermore coincide with the asymptotics @xcite of the ponzano ",
    "regge model @xcite , which can be understood as a quantized ( first order ) version of regge calculus .",
    "this measure is given by [ rmeasure ] d ( l ) = _ _ e bulk _",
    "e bdry . here",
    "invariance of the measure means , that the form of the measure does not change if one integrates out edge variables .",
    "this integration process can be organized locally and interpreted as changing and in fact coarse  graining the triangulation .",
    "there are two such local changes , the so  called @xmath46 and @xmath47 pachner moves , which generate ( together with their inverses ) all possible ( bulk ) changes of the triangulation . for the @xmath47 move one",
    "integrates out one edge , and one can show explicitly that the form of the measure ( [ rmeasure ] ) does not change .",
    "for the @xmath46 pachner move one integrates out four edges .",
    "the corresponding hessian matrix has one negative eigenvalue ( which thus would lead to a divergence and reflects the conformal mode problem of gravity ) and three null eigenvalues , corresponding to the vertex ",
    "displacement gauge symmetry , that one expects .",
    "the negative eigenvalue can be dealt with , as in the continuum @xcite , by ` analytically continuing ' this mode to have a positive eigenvalue . to deal with the three null eigenvalues one proceeds by ( a ) integrating out one edge ( which does not coincide with a null vector ) and ( b ) removing a measure factor that corresponds to the measure over the gauge orbit @xcite .",
    "this latter measure factor is only determined up to numerical constants . to achieve form invariance of ( [ rmeasure ] ) one has to choose to remove _",
    "d x_p^a = _",
    "i=2,3,4 d_0i where @xmath48 is the euclidean measure over the position @xmath49 of a vertex in @xmath22 , which gives the gauge orbit corresponding to the vertex displacement symmetry .",
    "here one uses the identity @xcite _",
    "a=1^d dx^a_0= _",
    "i=1^d l_0i dl_0i between the @xmath50dimensional euclidean measure associated to the cartesian coordinates of the vertex @xmath51 and the edge lengths @xmath52 of a @xmath50simplex with vertices @xmath53 and volume @xmath54 .",
    "the important point is , that the existence of this triangulation invariant measure in 3d allows us to choose any bulk triangulation for the evaluation of the partition function to one  loop order , and we will choose the coarsest one possible .",
    "such a ( local ) measure does exist only in 3d . for 4d",
    "regge calculus one can show that no local measures exist that reproduce the amount of triangulation invariance extant in the classical action , which is invariant under @xmath55 and @xmath56 pachner moves , but not under @xmath57 pachner moves @xcite .",
    "having collected all the necessary preliminaries , we are going to define and compute the partition function for linearized regge calculus . to this end",
    "we have to ( a ) choose a discretization and ( b ) find the linearized regge action for this triangulation and the background geometry at hand .",
    "the linearized regge action needs to be brought into a convenient form  here by a ` twisted ' lattice fourier transform , so that the bulk variables can be easily integrated out .",
    "linearized regge calculus on a regular lattice has been first considered in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a slightly more general set  up ) .",
    "although it did not consider a boundary , the main steps we use have been developed in @xcite .      given the bulk triangulation independence of 3d regge calculus it is sufficient to choose for our calculation a very coarse bulk triangulation .",
    "however we might have to take the continuum limit for the boundary triangulation and should therefore allow for a sufficiently general triangulation to achieve it .",
    "the spacetime we are considering has the topology of a solid torus .",
    "we cut this torus to a cylinder of height @xmath6 and slice it into @xmath58 cylinders of smaller height @xmath59 .",
    "note that in gluing back the cylinder to a solid torus we have to take into account the angular potential / twist parameter .",
    "each cylinder is furthermore cut along @xmath60 radial lines of length @xmath18 , and approximated by @xmath60 prisms ( their boundary becomes piecewise linear ) , see figure [ fig_1 ] .",
    "each of those prisms can be triangulated with three tetrahedra , see figure [ fig_1 ] .     and",

    "[ fig_1],title=\"fig : \" ]    this introduces 6 types of edge lengths .",
    "there are three types of bulk edges :    * the bulk radial edges , forming four edges of the prism , whose background length we denote by @xmath18 and whose small deviation we denote by @xmath62 .",
    "that is we write the radial length variables as @xmath63 . * the bulk edges subdividing two sides of the prism diagonally with background length @xmath64 .",
    "we will denote the corresponding fluctuation variable by @xmath50 . * the edges that make up the axis of the cylinder ( i.e. of radial coordinate @xmath65 ) of background length @xmath59 and associated fluctuation variable @xmath66 .",

    "we give coordinates @xmath73\\times [ 0,1,\\ldots n_t-1]$ ] to the vertices of this lattice . on the cylinder ( oriented in time direction )",
    "we also orient all edges so that they point either to the right , up or right  up .",
    "we orient the bulk radial and diagonal edges to point to the centre of the cylinder and the time axis edges to point up .",

    "thus we used a very coarse bulk triangulation , which minimized the computational effort . despite the topological nature of the theory we found that the partition function with boundary can be described by a field theory .",
    "in particular the part of the effective boundary action that is invariant under ( linearized ) boundary diffeomorphisms is dual to a field theory of liouville type .",
    "the topological invariance of the 3d regge action and the measure ( [ rmeasure ] ) ensures that the results do not change if we alter the bulk triangulation .",
    "in particular we could change our set  up and subdivide the cylinder , obtained by cutting the torus , into cylindrical rings and a thin cylinder at the centre . for the cylinder at the centre we would use the same triangulation as before and",
    "of course obtain the same partition function .",
    "the cylindrical rings are again cut into time slices , and these slices are subdivided by alternating cuboids and the same prisms as considered before .",
    "( the hessian of the regge action for such cuboids has been computed in @xcite . )        the partition function for a cylindrical ring does now depend on two sets of boundary data , from the inner and outer boundary .",
    "we can thus understand this partition function as a map from the hilbert space defined on the inner boundary to a hilbert space defined on the outer boundary . in the set ",
    "up considered here the outer boundary would have more lattice sites .",
    "note that it would not be characterized by a `` small radius '' , as the radius is part of the boundary variables over which one would integrate in glueing the partition function .",
    "the map defined by the cylindrical ring realizes therefore a refinement map , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "moreover this refinement map is defined by the dynamics itself ",
    "one uses the `` radial evolution '' map for the definition of this refinement map .",
    "also mera tensor networks @xcite can be essentially seen as refinement maps between hilbert spaces of different sizes",
    ". moreover the two building blocks of such a mera networks , disentanglers and isometries , are mirrored in the cuboids and prisms , with which one can discretize the cylindrical rings .",
    "mera networks have been discussed lately also in the relation to ads / cft holography @xcite . in particular it has been proposed that the entanglement structure encoded in the networks defines an ads geometry .",
    "see however @xcite for alternative proposals .",
    "the regge discretization discussed here can also be understood in terms of tensor networks , in particular if one generalizes to so  called decorated tensor networks introduced in @xcite .",
    "this tensor network would a priori be a 3d network , as opposed to the mera networks , which are two  dimensional .",
    "in fact the mera networks are proposed as describing stationary spacetimes .",
    "we can however produce a 2d network from the 3d network by considering only one time slice and by gluing the down and up sides of each building block .",
    "in this we can produce an example ( that provides the tensors explicitly ) of a mera network describing gravity .",
    "here we are concerned with the case without cosmological constant , however this is easily generalizable to gravity with a ( negative ) cosmological constant .",
    "the discretization of the torus using cuboids and prisms further allows to perform the continuum limit in the bulk .",
    "this will not change the results for a topological theory , as considered here , however it will be necessary if one considers non  topological theories , for instance by adding matter field to the gravitational dynamics . using a negative cosmological constant the set ",
    "up is related to that of holographic renormalization @xcite and the maps defined by the cylindrical rings can be understood to implement the renormalization flow .      to connect the partition function for the torus to thermodynamical quantities ,",
    "it is necessary to choose a different boundary term which is 1/2 of the usual ghy boundary term given in , @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xcite specifies asymptotic boundary conditions at infinity which lead to a well  defined variational principle .",
    "regge calculus , on the other hand , incorporates naturally the ghy boundary term without the extra @xmath268 @xcite .",
    "one can adjust the regge action by adding terms so that in effect one has 1/2 of the ghy term .",
    "this does however change the equations of motion for edges which are contained in tetrahedra glued to the boundary .    for the triangulation at hand",
    "this does however apply for all edges .",
    "indeed the background equations of motion get changed for the edges making up the time axis and the radial edges , which are now required to have non  vanishing deficit angle . to avoid this we can change to a triangulation built in the following way : we take our original triangulation ( with only prisms ) and glue to it a ` thin ' ring .",
    "this ring can be either triangulated with only cuboids or with cuboids and prisms , as we described in the previous section .",
    "the equations of motion will now require non  vanishing deficit angles around the time and radial edges of the cylindrical ring . to accommodate them ( that is in particular a non  vanishing deficit angle for the radial edges ) we need to allow more general background lengths for the cuboid ( and prism ) building blocks , see figure [ cube ] .    in this way we can use the cylindrical ring discretization as a map which convert the standard boundary term into the alternative boundary term .",
    "after computing the partition function at finite radius one can then consider the infinite radius limit .",
    "alternatively one can ask for boundary conditions at finite radius which are compatible with the alternative boundary term . in general",
    "this will involve keeping a combination of the boundary metric and the extrinsic curvature fixed .",
    "this can be also incorporated into regge calculus , either by working with length variables , or , by changing to a first order version of the theory @xcite . in the first order version one",
    "uses both the dihedral angles and the length variables , which translate to extrinsic curvature and metric variables in the continuum .",
    "( another version @xcite of ( 4d ) regge calculus uses area and angle variables which match the semiclassical variables of ( 4d ) spin foams . )    in all those cases one can work with the alternative variables for the full triangulation or use standard length variables and then transform the resulting partition function to new boundary conditions .",
