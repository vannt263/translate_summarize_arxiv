    "recent observations  @xcite support interest in inflationary models with non - minimal coupling between the inflaton field and the ricci scalar curvature @xmath0 .",
    "there are two classes of non - minimally coupled inflationary models . in one of them a function of the scalar field ( without a constant term ) non - minimally coupled to @xmath0 is added to the hilbert ",
    "einstein term  @xcite , while in the other it replaces the latter  @xcite . this second class of models is known under the name of induced gravity and cosmology .    in spite of great success of numerical simulations and of using of different approximation schemes for studying of cosmological solutions of the einstein equations , the exact analytical solutions of these equations",
    "are always useful .",
    "indeed , they permit to catch some important qualitative features of different cosmological models in the most easy and convenient way .",
    "most of the results of the exact integration of cosmological models with scalar fields are connected with minimally coupled models .",
    "a rather exhaustive list of such models was presented in paper @xcite .",
    "the integrability of the models with minimal and non - minimal coupling was studied by using some advanced mathematical methods in @xcite .    in  @xcite we proposed a method for constructing integrable models with non - minimally coupled scalar fields by using the interrelation between the jordan and einstein frames .",
    "we considered some explicitly integrable cosmological models for spatially flat friedmann universes filled with a minimally coupled scalar field , introduced in  @xcite .",
    "on using the einstein ",
    "jordan frame transition , we constructed their counterparts in induced gravity models and in models having a conformally coupled scalar field plus the hilbert  einstein term .    in a recent paper @xcite , a flat friedmann cosmological model in which the scalar field was conformally coupled to gravity and its potential included a positive cosmological term and a negative term with a quartic self - interaction was studied .",
    "such a model is exactly integrable and for a large class of initial conditions possesses a bounce and avoids the cosmological singularity .",
    "further , in such a model the cosmological evolution is , to a large extent , independent of the evolution of the scalar field .",
    "let us note , that the presence of bounces was considered as a positive feature in cosmology and their study has rather a rich history  @xcite .",
    "in a subsequent paper @xcite , the minimally coupled counterpart of the above model was considered .",
    "the corresponding potential is a linear combination of hyperbolic sine and cosine functions to the fourth power .",
    "it is curious that the model with such a potential was previously studied in great detail in a series of papers @xcite . in these papers such interesting topics as the possibility of the crossing of the big bang ",
    "big crunch singularities and the existence of anti - gravity regimes were studied .",
    "on the other hand one can see that this minimally coupled model belongs to a more wide class of models , described in the paper @xcite as a class 7 .",
    "we did not consider the non - minimally coupled counterpart of the models of this interesting class in our preceding paper @xcite and in the present paper we want to fill this gap .",
    "hence , we study the models of this class and find the conditions whereby they possesses a bounce .",
    "further , we show that the model , considered in @xcite is easily generalizable to the cases of closed and open friedmann universes , and present the corresponding solutions .",
    "remarkably , in this case the integrability of the non - minimally coupled model is more apparent that the integrability of its minimally coupled counterpart .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we review formulae that connect models in the einstein and jordan frames ; in sect .",
    "3 we describe the integrable cosmological model with a conformally coupled scalar field and its generalisation for the cases of closed and open friedmann universes ; in sect .",
    "4 we discuss the properties of the cosmological solutions for a general class of minimally coupled models with potentials , depending on hyperbolic functions and for their non - minimally coupled counterparts ; in sect .",
    "5 we study when the bounces are possible in these conformally coupled models ; in sect .",
