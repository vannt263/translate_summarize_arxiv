    "during the last two decades , the braneworld scenarios have received considerable attention .",
    "the idea of embedding our universe in a higher dimensional space - time provides new insights for solving long - standing problems such as the gauge hierarchy problem @xcite and cosmological constant problem @xcite .",
    "recently the thick brane scenario has obtained an increasing attention @xcite , since in more realistic models the thickness of the brane should be taken into account .",
    "one can refer to a recent review article on the subject of the thick brane solutions  @xcite .",
    "two real scalar fields coupled with gravity in 5-dimensional warped space - time as a thick brane realization was investigated by bazeia and gomes in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the brane was called a bloch brane .",
    "the bloch brane is an extension of the known bloch wall  @xcite in the context of braneworlds .",
    "two kinds of analytic solutions of asymmetric two - field branes were found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : a_y ] , one of the warp factors @xmath6 for the asymmetric two - field branes is plotted . from fig .",
    "[ fig : a_y ] , we can see that the warp factor tends to zero and a constant when @xmath7 goes to @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "however , in most of other brane solutions , the warp factors decrease to zero when @xmath7 approaches to @xmath10 or the boundaries of the extra dimension .    in a braneworld theory , a very interesting and important problem is the localization of fermions .",
    "we know that localization of fermions on thick branes requires additional interactions besides gravity : a scalar - fermion coupling has to be included . for some thick branes , with the scalar - fermion coupling , there may exit single bound state ( the massless mode ) @xcite , while for some other ones , mass gap and finite discrete kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes appear in the kk spectrum of fermions @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the simplest yukawa coupling @xmath11 was introduced for the two - field brane model , and one single bound state of left - handed fermions was obtained .",
    "as the asymmetric two - field branes found in @xcite are very different from symmetric thick branes , an interesting problem is to investigate how spin-1/2 fermions can be localized on the branes .",
    "we will show that the coupling @xmath4 considered in the literature for two - scalar brane models do not support the localization of 4-dimensional massless fermions on the branes .",
    "so , other couplings should be considered in order for massless chiral fermions to localize on the branes .",
    "we find that for the coupling @xmath5 , the kink - fermion coupling corresponding to one - scalar - generated brane scenarios , the zero mode of left - handed fermions can be trapped on the branes providing that the coupling constants @xmath12 and @xmath13 satisfy some conditions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we first review the asymmetric two - field brane model .",
    "then we study the localization and spectra of fermions on the asymmetric two - field branes by presenting the mass - independent potentials of the corresponding schrdinger problem of fermionic kk modes .",
