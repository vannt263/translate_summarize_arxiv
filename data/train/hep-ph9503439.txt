    "there have been many accelerator experiments studying hadronic interactions in this energy region , however , not many are suitable for our purpose . in the high energy proton - proton interactions , it is normally assumed that the spectrum of secondary particles satisfies the feynman scaling hypothesis , which is confirmed by collider experiments up to a lab .",

    "although there is a weak breaking of the hypothesis in the central region , it has no significant effect on atmospheric @xmath1fluxes .",
    "we employ an one  dimensional approximation in which all the secondary particles and the @xmath1 s keep the direction of their parent cosmic rays , throughout the energy range of concern . for high energy @xmath1 s ,",
    "this is a good approximation because of the nature of hadronic interactions .",
    "we also expect that the directional  average of @xmath1fluxes may be calculated with good accuracy even at low energies .",

    "it is noted that atmospheric @xmath1 s are created through the hadronic interactions of cosmic rays and air nuclei , and therefore are dependent on the number of nucleons rather than the number of nuclei .",
    "the contribution of a heavier cosmic ray nucleus to the atmospheric @xmath1flux is larger than that of a cosmic ray proton .",

    "the solar wind drives back the low energy cosmic rays which are entering into the solar sphere of influence , and the strength of the solar wind varies with solar activity .",

    "however , this produces only a very small effect on the calculation of atmospheric @xmath1 s due to the proton dominance of the cosmic ray flux and the relatively small contribution of cosmic rays of this energy .",
    "the geomagnetic field determines the minimum energy with which a cosmic ray can arrive at the earth .",
    "this effect is caused by the magnetic shield effect for low energy cosmic rays .",
    "for the cosmic ray nucleus , the minimum energy of cosmic rays arriving at the earth is determined by the minimum rigidity ( rigidity cutoff ) rather than the minimum momentum .",
    "we note that the rigidity cutoff is a function of the entering position on the earth and arrival direction ( zenith angle , @xmath42 , and azimuth angle , @xmath43 ) . since the mass@xmath13charge ratio of helium and cno nuclei is twice that of protons , those nuclei carry lower energy nucleons into the atmosphere than protons .",

    "the value of the rigidity cutoff for the actual geomagnetic field can be obtained from a computer simulation of cosmic ray trajectories . in this simulation , an antiproton , which has the same mass as a proton but the opposite charge ,",
    "is used as the test particle .",
    "we note that the change @xmath49 is equivalent to the change of @xmath50 in the equation of motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field ; @xmath51 where * p * is the momentum , * v * is the velocity , and * b * is the magnetic field . to determine the rigidity cutoff at different positions and for different directions , we launch antiprotons from the earth , varying the position and direction .",
    "when a test particle with a given momentum reaches a distance of 10 times the earth s radius , where the strength of the geomagnetic field decreases to the same level as the interstellar magnetic field ( @xmath52  t ) , it is assumed that the test particle has escaped from the geomagnetic field . assuming the momentum distribution of cosmic rays is isotropic in angular space , some cosmic rays which have the same rigidity can arrive at the earth following the same trajectory but in the opposite direction .",
    "the rigidity cutoff is calculated as the minimum momentum with which the test particle escapes from the geomagnetic field .",
    "we note that for protons the rigidity and the momentum is the same quantity .",
    "[ kamcut ]    in an one  dimensional approximation , we need the rigidity for the arrival direction of @xmath1 s at @xmath1detector sites .",
    "we found that the magnetic field calculated up to 5th order of the expansion gives almost the same result for rigidity cutoff as calculations with higher order expansions .",

    ", however , the calculation of rigidity cutoff is very simplified , and this may result in a systematic error in the absolute value of the atmospheric @xmath1fluxes of 10  20  % at 100  mev and 5  % at 1  gev .",
    "other effects caused by the one  dimensional approximation and errors due to the superposition model at high energies are considered to be small compared to other errors .",
    "the calculation method also results in an error in the atmospheric @xmath1flux . with the full monte carlo calculation",
    ", it is estimated to be @xmath222  % for 30  mev",
    " 3  gev due to the statistics . with the hybrid method ,",
    "the statistics and the fitting error are sources of the uncertainty .",
    "both the statistics and fitting error are combined and estimated to be @xmath69  % up to 100  300  gev for @xmath9 and @xmath167 , and up to 30  100  gev for @xmath77 and @xmath166 , depending on the zenith angle .    combining all the systematic and non  systematic errors ,",
    "the total error is estimated as 20  % at 100  mev , 15 % from 1  gev to 100  gev , and 20  25  % at the highest energy in our calculation . however , the errors of the species ratio is smaller than the absolute value , since the @xmath1species ratio is not affected much by the uncertainty of primary fluxes and the calculation scheme .",
    "it is estimated to be @xmath11 10  % below 100  gev for @xmath172 and @xmath11 5  % below 30  gev for @xmath223 .",
    "these errors also increase to 10  15  % at the highest energies in our calculation .",
    "although the main parent meson is different for high energy atmospheric @xmath8 s and @xmath1 s , one may consider that the comparison of calculated and observed atmospheric @xmath8flux reduces the systematic error due to the primary cosmic ray flux .",
    "the agreement of our calculation , deis data , and mutron data for near horizontal directions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : h - mu - obs ] ) suggests that the systematic error of the atmospheric @xmath1flux caused by the uncertainty of the cosmic ray flux may be @xmath11  10  % at @xmath224 100  1,000  gev in our calculation .",
    "however , we note that there are similar problems for observation of @xmath8fluxes with that of primary cosmic rays : determining the instrumental efficiency and the exposure factor .",
    "the mass group claims that their total uncertainty in efficiency is around 20  % .",
    "this systematic error for ground based experiments could be smaller , but it is seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : v - mu - obs ] that @xmath8-fluxes observed for near vertical directions by different groups differ by more than 20  % . also taking the possible systematic error in the @xmath62-ratio into account ,",
    "we conclude that the systematic error caused by the uncertainty in the primary flux is @xmath19 20  % at @xmath225  gev .",
    "in this paper , we presented the calculation of atmospheric @xmath1fluxes as follows ; first , we summarized the physics related to the primary cosmic ray flux .",
    "the low energy cosmic ray flux was parametrized following the work of nagashima et al .",
    "@xcite based on the compilation of the cosmic ray spectrum by webber and lezniak  @xcite for solar max . , mid . , and min .",
    "in order to calculate the rigidity cutoff due to the geomagnetic field , we simulated the trajectories of cosmic rays . also the primary cosmic ray flux in the 100  gev ",
    "100  tev range was compiled for h , he , cno , ne - s , fe nuclei groups calculating the nucleon flux for protons and neutrons .",
    "we used the nucrin interaction model  @xcite@xcite for @xmath226 5  gev , lund model ( jetset ver .",
    "6.3 )  @xcite@xcite for 5  500  gev , and cosmos for @xmath14 500  gev for the hadronic interaction interactions of cosmic rays .",
    "the atmospheric @xmath1flux was calculated with a full monte carlo method for 30  mev ",
    "3  gev , and with a hybrid method for 1  gev  1,000  gev .",
    "one of the most important results for low - energy @xmath1fluxes is that the ratio @xmath227 is almost the same ( @xmath228 ) as other calculations for 100  mev ",
    "3  gev  @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , whereas underground detectors found a significant difference in the ratio ( e  like  event)@xmath13(@xmath8like  event ) from the value expected from the calculated atmospheric @xmath1flux .",
    "we note that the quantity @xmath227 remains relatively unaffected by variations in the interaction model and primary cosmic ray spectrum including the chemical composition .",
    "the difference between the observed and the expected value of the ratio ( e  like  event)@xmath13(@xmath8like  event ) might be explained by other physics , such as @xmath1oscillations .",
    "if this difference is to be explained by @xmath1oscillations with @xmath229 , the up - going @xmath8-flux , which is induced by the high energy @xmath1-flux , will show a different zenith angle dependence from the expected one .",
    "we calculated the zenith angle dependence of the atmospheric @xmath1flux in detail : for each zenith angle bin of @xmath230 , for 1  1,000  gev .",
    "this atmospheric @xmath1flux could be used to calculate the expectation flux of up - going @xmath8 s .",
    "we note that the absolute value and the ratio are connected to the lower values smoothly at @xmath19 3  gev .",
    "also they are compared with the calculation of other authors  @xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite .",
    "atmospheric @xmath8fluxes were also calculated at sea level and at high altitudes .",
    "they were compared with the experimental data and the agreements are found to be satisfactory .",
    "the agreement at high altitude is especially important for the calculation of the atmospheric @xmath1flux at low energies .",
    "although the parent mesons are different for atmospheric @xmath1 s and @xmath8 s , our calculation , deis data , and mutron data agree very well each other for the @xmath8flux of near horizontal directions at high energies ( @xmath122  gev ) .",
    "we conclude that we have used a reasonable primary cosmic ray spectrum , chemical composition , and interaction model .",
    "we stress again that the main source of the systematic error in the atmospheric @xmath1flux is the uncertainty of the primary cosmic ray flux . especially for the calculation of the atmospheric @xmath1flux above 1,000  gev ,",
    "the lack of knowledge of the cosmic ray flux above 100  tev@xmath13nucleon is crucial .",
