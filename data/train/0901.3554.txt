    "the range of surface density profiles for galaxies in a cluster is a telltale of its dynamical history .",
    "for instance , an excess of cuspy profiles over , say , the mean field galaxy distribution , is indicative of recent merger activity .",
    "conversely , extended exponential profiles are representative of quiescent evolution over long timescales ( e.g. , toth & ostriker 1992 ) .",
    "the study of galaxy light profiles has a rich history with seminal early contributions from de vaucouleurs ( 1948 ; 1959 ) , srsic ( 1968 ) , and freeman ( 1970 ) .",
    "de vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) established that the surface brightness ( hereafter sb ) profiles of early type stellar systems may follow a strongly concentrated distribution now referred to as the `` de vaucouleurs '' or `` @xmath7 '' profile .",
    "de vaucouleurs ( 1959 ) later reported the ubiquity of exponential sb profiles in disk galaxies while srsic ( 1968 ) proposed a generalized fitting function that encompasses the exponential and de vaucouleurs profiles .",
    "based on photographic images for 36 disk and s0 galaxies , freeman ( 1970 ) postulated that the distribution of disk central surface brightness ( hereafter csb ) , defined as the intercept of an exponential disk fit at @xmath8 , peaks at @xmath9=21.65 b mag arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "deep , wide - field ccd , galaxy surveys have since revealed a rather continuous distributions of csbs from high surface brightness ( hsb ) to low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies ( de jong & lacey 2000 ) . simulations and observations of galaxy structure have thus far suggested a continuous range of properties over , rather than fundamental departures from , the hsb and lsb regimes .",
    "however , based on near - infrared ( nir ) observations of the ursa major ( uma ) cluster , tully & verheijen ( 1997 ; hereafter tv97 ) inferred that the distribution of disk central surface brightnesses could be bimodal .    based on a sample of 62 ursa major cluster galaxies observed at optical and nir bands , tv97 argued that the distribution of disk central surface brightnesses , @xmath9 , was not continuous as expected from simple structure formation models , but rather bimodal .",
    "the bimodality of the @xmath9 distribution was not convincingly observed at optical ( bri ) bands , which tv97 argued might be due to extinction effects at optical bands . at k@xmath10 filter",
    "was described by wainscoat & cowie ( 1992 ) .",
    "it resembles the 2mass ks , with the primary difference being that it excludes the longest wavelength part of the k atmospheric window in order to reduce thermal emission . ]",
    ", tv97 could assert the existence of two peaks in the sb distribution at 17.28 k@xmath10 @xmath11 for hsb galaxies ( corresponding to `` freeman s law '' ) and at 19.69 k@xmath10 @xmath11 in the lsb regime .",
    "the surface brightness of the gap was centered at @xmath518.5 k@xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "inclination and extinction corrections to the optical surface brightness profiles would bring a csb bimodality to light in these bands as well .",
    "tv97 stressed , however , that the sb bimodality at optical bands could plausibly be an artifact of their extinction correction which applies only to hsb galaxies .",
    "still , the fact that the k@xmath10-band is nearly insensitive to dust and that the distribution of @xmath12 values is clearly bimodal is a strong case for tv97 s argument of structural bimodality in spiral galaxies .",
    "tv97 divided their sample into galaxies with and without a significant near - neighbour , to identify an environmental effect .",
    "the small uma membership however means that the isolated and crowded sub - samples contain only roughly 30 galaxies each . despite the statistical limitations , tv97 reported evidence for an enhancement of the bimodality in the isolated sub - sample",
    "the majority of galaxies with intermediate @xmath9 measurements were found to have near neighbours .",
    "this led tv97 to suggest the existence of two stable dynamical configurations of baryonic and dark matter , likely induced by the environment , leading to the distinct lsb and hsb populations .    comparing light distributions with total mass distributions inferred from synthesis maps allowed",
    "tv97 to further classify these two states . in lsb galaxies ,",
    "dark matter dominates the potential at all radii ; gas and stars have sufficient angular momentum that they have not settled to the core and are orbiting in response to the dark matter distribution . in hsb galaxies ,",
    "baryonic matter has dissipated its energy and transferred angular momentum sufficiently to become self - gravitating over the central @xmath13 exponential disk scale lengths ( courteau & rix 1999 ; dutton et  al .",
    "2007 , hereafter d07 ) .",
    "a gap between lsb and hsb galaxies may suggest that galaxies avoid a situation where baryonic and dark matter have comparable dynamical influence in the inner disk .",
    "the higher incidence of intermediate surface brightness ( hereafter isb ) galaxies with near neighbors suggests that tidal influences might drive a galaxy from the lsb to the hsb state .",
    "although tv97 s study provided several valid arguments for a structural bimodality of cluster galaxies , it still suffered a few shortcomings .",
    "first , the uma cluster membership is small . with only 62 galaxies ,",
    "a structural study is plagued by statistical uncertainty ( bell & de blok 2000 ) .",
    "tv97 estimated the disk central surface brightness , @xmath9 , by fitting an exponential profile to the outer disk in order to avoid the bulge component .",
    "the uncertainty in this `` marking - the - disk '' technique depends on the subjective interpretation of the bulge size and the disk fit baseline .",
    "this caveat was however examined carefully by mcdonald et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) and found not to be the cause of the observed bimodality .",
    "finally , tv97 s result could be unique to the uma cluster and not representative of the true nature of disk galaxies in clusters or the field ( de jong & lacey 2000 ) .",
    "because the uma cluster lacks early type galaxies , the observed bimodality could simply be due to a missing morphological class of galaxies .",
    "it is , however , our impression that none of these objections are stronger or more convincing than the claim of bimodality itself , as we shall verify below for virgo cluster galaxies .    following the release of the sloan digital sky survey ( york et  al .",
    "2000 ; hereafter sdss ) , there have been many reports of bimodality in the distributions of galaxy color , star formation and clustering properties ( strateva et  al .  2001 ; blanton et  al .",
    "2003 ; kauffmann et  al .  2003",
    "; baldry et  al .  2004 ; brinchmann et  al .  2004 ; balogh et  al .  2004 ) and even reports of trimodality in galaxy concentrations ( bailin & harris 2008 ) .",
    "colors , star formation and clustering of galaxies are all intimately linked with a transition baryonic ( light - weighted ) mass of 3@xmath1410@xmath15m@xmath16 ( kauffmann et  al .",
    "red galaxies , at the upper end of the mass scale typically have low current star formation rates and are found primarily in cluster or high - density environments , while the less massive blue galaxies have high star formation rates and are found primarily in the field ( dressler 1980 ) .",
    "these results have catalyzed several new variants of galaxy formation models and evolution .",
    "for instance , an appealing explanation for any star formation bimodality involves two phases of gas accretion in galaxies via hot and cold modes ( birnboim & dekel 2003 ; dekel & birnboim 2006 ) . the hot mode is the standard picture of gas that is shock heated to the virial temperature during gravitational collapse of the gas and halo .",
    "this shock - heated gas eventually cools and settles into a galaxy ( rees & ostriker 1977 ; white & rees 1978 ; white & frenk 1991 ) .",
    "the cold mode consists of cold filaments penetrating far inside the halo ( birnboim & dekel 2003 ) .",
    "these can occur in low - mass halos where virial shocks are absent and cold gas is accreted quasi - spherically . for halos with larger masses ,",
    "the gas is shock heated to the virial temperature everywhere except where cold , dense gas filaments penetrate the virial radius . as the mass increases , only filaments of increasingly dense cold gas can penetrate the halo without being shock - heated .",
    "kere et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) used semi - analytic models to predict that the transition _ halo _ mass where hot accretion becomes more efficient than cold accretion is @xmath5@xmath17m@xmath16 .",
    "this concords with the transition _ baryonic _ mass , @xmath18  m@xmath16 , in the color / sfr bimodality , assuming a universal baryonic to dark matter ratio of @xmath510% ( zavala et  al .",
    "kere et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) also found that low - mass halos in dense environments have enhanced hot accretion .",
    "the cold mode would thus apply mostly to late - type , disk galaxies while the hot mode pertains mostly to early - type , spheroidal , galaxies .",
    "this simplistic picture appears to match observations well , but realistic star formation prescriptions are needed for more robust data - model comparisons .",
    "we now wish to test tv97 s claim of structural bimodality in a different environment and using a larger sample .",
    "thanks to its proximity , large size , and broad morphological coverage , the virgo cluster is the next logical cosmic structure to consider as we revisit tv97 s analysis . if confirmed , we can also assess whether the reported bimodality of surface brightnesses , for spiral galaxies at least , is in any way related to the sdss color bimodality discussed above and whether the global trimodality of galaxy concentrations for all hubble types ( bailin & harris 2008 ) is also observed .",
    "the organisation of this paper is as follows : in , we discuss briefly our database for the 742 virgo cluster catalog ( binggeli et  al .  1985 ;",
    "hereafter vcc ) that are found in the sdss 6th data release ( adelman - mccarthy et  al .  2008 ; hereafter dr6 ) . out of these",
    ", we have defined a complete , magnitude - limited , sample of 286 vcc galaxies with @xmath19 for which deep h - band photometry was obtained .",
    "the full description of our data set , and details about the data acquisition and reduction methods are given in mcdonald et  al .",
    "( 2009 ; hereafter `` data paper '' ) .",
    "we introduce in specific parametric and non - parametric quantities that will permit a comprehensive understanding of the structure of virgo cluster galaxies of all types . in appendix a , we determine the effects of various errors on the distributions of various non - parametric quantities in .",
    "we present final results in , and examine their possible interpretations in .",
    "we assume in this paper a distance to all virgo cluster galaxies of 16.5 mpc or m - m=31.18 ( mei et  al .",
    "2007 ) . at that distance , @xmath20 = 80 pc .",
    "grey points are galaxies in our vcc / sdss sample , while black points are the remaining galaxies in the vcc .",
    "the size of the points scales with the total luminosity .",
    "the concentric dashed circles are projected galactocentric distances ( 1 , 2 and 3 mpc ) around the center of the virgo cluster at m87 .",
    "the dashed red circle corresponds to a distance of @xmath21 from m87.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]        the study of the unbiased distribution of galaxy surface brightness requires volume completeness .",
    "a solution to this issue is to study galaxies at a common distance in a cluster .",
    "our sample is drawn from the virgo cluster catalogue ( binggeli et  al .  1985 ;",
    "hereafter vcc ) .",
    "the vcc catalogue contains 2096 galaxies within an area of @xmath5140 deg@xmath22 on the sky , centered on the galaxy m87 at @xmath23@xmath512@xmath2425@xmath25 and @xmath26@xmath513@xmath27 .",
    "the vcc is asserted to be complete down to a limiting absolute magnitude of @xmath28 and to contain many objects as faint as @xmath29 ( binggeli et  al .",
    "1985 ) .",
    "our first task was to acquire deep , optical , photometry for as many vcc galaxies as could be found in the sdss / dr6 .",
    "a further spatial cut was made following trentham & tully ( 2002 ) to reject 40% of the cluster that is contaminated by the w , w and m background groups .",
    "the w , w and m groups were identified by de vaucouleurs ( 1961 ) and ftaclas et al . ( 1984 ) , respectively . w and m lie about twice as far away as virgo and w lies about 50% further than virgo . these and related structures in the virgo southern extension all lie in a flattened plane close to the supergalactic equator , contaminating the western edge of the virgo cluster .",
    "trentham & tully ( 2002 ) discuss this problem and describe how the projected area of the cluster can be separated between zones with negligible and serious contamination .",
    "images from the sdss / dr6 were extracted for a total of 742 vcc galaxies obeying these spatial cuts .",
    "we will refer to this sub - sample as the `` vcc / sdss '' sample .    in order to ensure that our virgo catalog reaches below the lsb peak of uma ( tv97 )",
    ", we must achieve completeness at least down to @xmath30 mag ( assuming a distance of 15.5 mpc to uma ) . in order to ensure that no intermediate surface brightness galaxies are missed",
    ", we can define a complete sub - sample that includes all vcc galaxies with @xmath31 mag ( i.e. @xmath19 ) .",
    "we also make an additional two spatial cuts to ensure that we only include bound cluster members : 1 ) all galaxies identified as `` background '' by binggeli et  al .",
    "( 1985 ) are removed and 2 ) all galaxies further than @xmath21 from the center of the cluster , defined as the position of m87 , are removed .",
    "these magnitude and spatial cuts leave us with a total of 303 vcc galaxies centered on m87 . a further 8 vcc galaxies ( 1068,1217,1258,1355,1665,1768,1889 and 2096 ) with recessional velocity measurements , @xmath32 3000 kms^-1km@xmath33s@xmath34 , and the galaxies vcc0723 and vcc0991 , with significant foreground stars , were also excluded . the following seven vcc galaxies ( 530,950,1052,1287,1571,1822 and 1992 )",
    "could also not be detected at h - band ( see ) , and were left out of the sample ( this has no effect on our final conclusions ) .",
    "we are left with a final , complete , sub - sample of 286 vcc galaxies with @xmath19 , covering a wide range of luminosities and morphologies . for reasons that will soon be clear",
    ", we will refer to this complete sub - sample as our `` h - band '' sample .",
    "shows the distribution of all vcc galaxies in black , as well as the 742 vcc / sdss galaxies in grey , and the h - band sample in multi - colors . shows the distribution of galaxy morphologies , as taken from the nasa extragalactic database ( hereafter ned ) .",
    "the broad morphological coverage is important to ensure that no distribution of galaxy structural parameter is biased by morphological segregation .",
    "shows that virgo is intrinsically rich in de , s0 and i m galaxies ( see also mei et al .",
    "this is not due to a bias in our sample but simply to the nature of the virgo cluster ( as represented by the vcc ) .",
    "the gas - rich vcc galaxies are represented at approximately the same levels in our vcc / sdss and h - band samples relative to the full vcc with completeness between 11% and 42% .",
    "the bright magnitude limit of the h - band sample also implies a higher number of early - type galaxies relative to the later types .",
    "however , we will show in that the bimodality of surface brightnesses is detected in each morphological bin ( early or late type ) and that it is thus unlikely due to the morphological make - up of this specific cluster or our sampling of it .",
    "following tv97 s study of the uma cluster , we have sought to obtain optical and especially near - ir photometry as well as dynamical measurements for all of our h - band sample galaxies .",
    "the sdss @xmath35 imaging for this sample will yield a distribution of luminosities , surface brightnesses , scale lengths and concentrations , as a function of optical wavelength .",
    "the optical colors will enable a comparison of any surface brightness bimodality , if present , with the observed sdss galaxy color bimodality ( e.g. , strateva et  al .",
    "2001 ) and the ability to determine if one is simply a consequence of the other .",
    "the near - ir images are however essential to uncover the true distribution of galaxy surface brightnesses , luminosities , and other galaxy parameters largely free of extinction by dust .",
    "we describe the extraction of the optical and nir imaging data below .    while most critical , our collection of dynamical parameters for vcc galaxies is still in progress and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "we have extracted calibrated @xmath35 images from the sdss / dr6 for 742 vcc galaxies , including the 286 galaxies in our `` h - band '' sample .",
    "surface brightness profiles and total luminosities were obtained for these galaxies in all five sdss bands by , first , performing isophotal ellipse fitting to the @xmath3-band images according to the methods of courteau ( 1996 ) , and then , applying the @xmath3-band isophotal solutions to the images in the other sdss bands .",
    "the latter ensures that color gradients extracted from all sdss images are computed from the same matching isophotes ( macarthur et  al .",
    "@xmath36-band images were consistently shallower than the @xmath37 bands and were thus discarded .",
    "sky levels for background subtraction and the photometric zero - points for calibration were obtained from the sdss image headers and the sdss archives , respectively .",
    "the remainder of the profile extraction technique is identical to that used for the near - ir photometry , as described below .",
    "due to practical constraints , new , deep , h - band imaging that would sample well below the putative surface brightness bimodality scale of tv97 could only be obtained for a smaller sample of vcc galaxies .",
    "this is the magnitude - limited `` h - band '' sample of 286 vcc galaxies with sdss imaging described above .",
    "deep h - band imaging for some vcc galaxies is already available from the two micron all - sky survey ( skrutskie et  al .",
    "2006 ; hereafter 2mass[multiblock footnote omitted ] ) and from the goldmine[multiblock footnote omitted ] database ( gavazzi et  al .  2003 ) .",
    "we were able to secure h - band imaging for the remainder of the h - band sample with the detectors ulbcam at the uh  2.2-m telescope , wfcam at ukirt and wircam at cfht over the period 2005 - 2008 .",

    "likewise , just a handful of goldmine images were deep enough to properly separate the bulge and disk light .",
    "we have defined the relative depth criterion , @xmath39 , as the ratio of the maximum extent of the h - band surface brightness profile divided by that of the sdss @xmath3-band profile : @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the radius where the surface brightness error exceeds 0.15 @xmath11 ( see mcdonald et  al .",

    "mcdonald et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) already considered the parametric ( i.e. model dependent ) analysis of uma spiral galaxies in order to test , and ultimately confirm , tv97 s claim of bimodality .",
    "the current , larger , virgo cluster sample however includes galaxies of all morphologies .",
    "while a parametric approach to model the shape of complex light profiles involves a multi - component decomposition ( e.g. , macarthur et  al .",
    "2003 ; mcdonald et  al .",
    "2008 ) , a non - parametric approach is free of model assumptions and reveals different aspects of galaxy structure .",
    "we explore both approaches below and it will be shown later that surface brightness bimodality is essentially independent of the method of light profile analysis .",
    "spheroidal and flattened galaxy systems have traditionally been modeled as the sum of a bulge and disk components ( see macarthur et  al .",
    "2003 ; mcdonald et  al .",
    "2008 for more details ) . the 1d light profile of a galaxy disk is typically parametrized as an exponential function : i_d(r)=i_0\\{-r } , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the disk central surface brightness and scale length , respectively .",
    "meanwhile , the projected 1d bulge light profile is better modeled as a srsic function ( srsic 1968 ) : i_b(r)=i_e\\{-b_n } , [ eq : sersic ] where @xmath47 is the half - light radius , @xmath48 is the surface brightness at that radius , and @xmath49 is the srsic shape parameter . with @xmath50 ,",
    "the srsic function reduces to the exponential function .",
    "in addition to the bulge and disk , we consider other components that may affect the light profile such as compact nuclei , spiral arms and disk truncations . ignoring these may result in large errors in the bulge and disk parameters ( mcdonald et  al .",

    "finally , we will examine the possibility that either of the sb bimodalities are due to regions with clustered hsb or lsb galaxies ( i.e. an infalling group ) .          in appendix",
    "a , we demonstrated how a sky measurement error of @xmath440.01% can result in an artificial truncation or upturn in a deep surface brightness profile .",
    "however , while lsb galaxies are highly sensitive to sky errors , a systematic over- or under- subtraction of the sky could hardly enhance the isb gap . in",
    ", we show the distribution of @xmath56 if the images for all the sample galaxies are systematically over- or under - subtracted by 0.05% ( a huge error at h - band ) .",
    "it is clear that , the net effect is to shift all galaxies towards lsb , not to create a gap .      in  4.1",
    ", we discussed deprojection corrections to measured surface brightness quantities . at nir wavelengths ,",
    "galaxies are nearly transparent and the correction for deprojection is purely geometric .",
    "since @xmath9 is measured from the disk fit , the geometric correction is trivial , provided the inclination of the disk is known .",
    "however , the quantity @xmath56 , which depends on both bulge and disk light , is less easily corrected .",
    "we thus make use of two different methods to correct @xmath56 for projection .",
    "first , we can write the corrected effective surface brightness of the whole galaxy , @xmath92 , as : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the axial ratio at the effective radius , @xmath47 .",
    "this correction ( method a ) is straightforward , since we know the ellipticity as a function of radius from isophotal fits (  3.2.3 ) .",
    "the second inclination correction ( method b ) requires the decomposition of the sb profile into bulge and disk components and deprojection of the two components separately . knowing the inclination of the disk , we can deproject the disk fit ( assuming full transparency ) .",
    "we further assume that the bulge requires no deprojection .",
    "this yields the correction for the global @xmath92 : @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the axial ratio of the outermost isophote .",
    "the effective radius is measured from the total light profile and the contributions from the individual bulge and disk profiles at this radius are used .",
    "this correction is intuitively appealing as the bulge should require less of a deprojection correction than the disk .",
    "the assumption of a spherical bulge may however be inadequate , especially in the presence of a bar .",
    "however , we find that the isophotes in the central regions of most of our galaxies that exhibit bulges are , in fact , fairly round",
    ".    shows the result of applying the two aforementioned inclination corrections .",
    "we find very little difference between methods a & b. as expected , the corrected values to face - on orientation for @xmath94 are systematically fainter .",
    "most importantly , regardless of the correction used , bimodality is always preserved .",
    "as there is little difference in the resulting distributions , we prefer method a for its simplicity and empirical , rather than parametric , quality .",
    "furthermore , method b is less desirable since it may yield large errors in cases when the disk fit is unreliable or if the assumption of spherical bulge is unwarranted .",
    "ideally , we wish to avoid any sensitivity to the bulge light as well as to localized radial structure .",
    "such a parameter for pure disks is @xmath9 , but we do not have an analog for both disks and spheroids .",
    "indeed , @xmath56 is affected by local structure while @xmath82 encompasses bulge light . of interest to us",
    "is to investigate if the use of a local vs global estimator of surface brightness at different galactocentric radii should cause bimodality .",
    "we can compute @xmath128 and @xmath129 as in  3.2.2 . at short radii",
    ", we expect both @xmath128 and @xmath130 to be biased by any bulge or bar , while at large radii @xmath128 should suffer mostly from sb fluctuations and sky subtraction errors . and",
    "table [ sbtable ] show the results of our exercise for all 286 vcc galaxies in our sample at h - band .",
    "the result is interesting : regardless of the specific measure of surface brightness , whether local or global , computed at small or large radii , the three sb peaks are always preserved .",

    "the remarkable result that the peak separations @xmath145esb - hsb@xmath146 and @xmath145hsb - lsb@xmath146 are nearly identical at most sb levels suggests that there may be a single mechanism responsible for all three peaks .",
    "thus , we have shown that both the early- and late - type structural bimodality persist regardless of the surface brightness measurement , inclination correction , and sky subtraction error .",
    "let us then address possible causes for the observed galaxy bimodalities , convinced that they are not an artifact of our methodology .",
    "it is conceivable that one of the three surface brightness peaks could be due to the infall of a small group of galaxies with a narrow surface brightness distribution . in order to investigate this issue",
    "we turn to , which shows the spatial distribution of galaxies in the four different sb peaks : hsb & lsb early - type galaxies , and hsb & lsb late - type galaxies .",
    "it is clear from that both the hsb and lsb spiral and irregular galaxies are spread uniformly throughout the cluster .",
    "likewise , most of the spheroids are distributed uniformly throughout the cluster , with an overabundance of hsb spheroids near the cluster center .",
    "thus , although there is a constant infall of galaxies into the virgo cluster , it does not appear that this is causing an artificial peak in the surface brightness distribution .",
    "freeman s law ( 1970 ) in its modern form is understood as the maximum surface brightness any galaxy disk can have , but it does not preclude the existence of fainter systems .",
    "the general picture today is that the surface brightness function of galaxies has a tail at low surface brightnesses that extends to arbitrarily low values ( de jong & lacey 2000 ) .",
    "previous studies that have attempted to quantify the distribution of galaxy surface brightnesses have focused mostly on field systems ( e.g. , mcgaugh & de blok 1995 ; de jong & lacey 2000 ; driver et  al .",
    "the effect of environment on galaxy surface brightnesses , if any , would thus be missed . in their pioneering study",
    ", tv97 observed that the structural bimodality is strengthened if their uma sample is restricted to isolated galaxies .",
    "for uma , an isolated galaxy was defined as a galaxy that has not encountered another galaxy during the lifetime of the cluster .",
    "since uma is dynamically young , this definition is a reasonable one .",
    "however , since the crossing time of the virgo cluster is less than one - tenth of a hubble time ( trentham & tully 2002 ) , it is unreasonable to perform a similar analysis for virgo cluster galaxies .",
    "every galaxy in the cluster should have had at least one significant encounter within the last gyr , which means that we can not divide the sample into isolated and non - isolated galaxies .",
    "various studies have reported that lsb galaxies form primarily in isolated environments ( e.g. , rosenbaum & bomans 2004 ) likely from 1 - 2@xmath147 peaks in the initial density fluctuation spectrum .",
    "however , these authors found that local lsbs are almost exclusively found in clusters and filaments .",
    "if lsb galaxies form from 1 - 2@xmath147 peaks , they would migrate from voids to high - density regions .",
    "this does not explain how dynamically young galaxy clusters , such as uma , could have a high abundance of lsb galaxies .",
    "instead , perhaps the cluster environment enhances lsb formation which would explain the current location of the lsb population as well as the sb bimodality seen in uma and virgo .    for the uma and virgo clusters ,",
    "there is a bimodality of disk surface brightness in spiral galaxies as well as bimodality in effective surface brightness for early - type galaxies . since",
    "previous studies of field galaxies have not shown any evidence for bimodal surface brightness distributions , we might therefore think of structural bimodality as a cluster effect .",
    "however , it should be noted that most of the studies of the surface brightness distribution of field galaxies have focused strictly on optical imaging for lack of available complete similar data bases at ir wavelengths .",
    "we showed in figs .",
    "[ virgo_sdss_csb ] & [ virgo_esb_sdss ] that the bimodality in disk and total surface brightnesses is enhanced in the nir , due to uncertain and significant corrections for dust at optical wavelengths .",
    "none of the major nir data bases available today ( e.g. , de jong 1996 ; jarrett et  al .  2003 ; grauer et  al .",
    "2003 ; macarthur et  al .  2003 ; smith et  al .",
    "2008 ) cover the full range of surface brightness to sample the lsb peak .",
    "for this reason , it is unclear whether the structural bimodality observed at nir wavelengths is indeed a cluster effect since it has only been observed in galaxy clusters thus far , or whether it is inherent to galaxies in all environments .",
    "since we see structural bimodality in the most isolated galaxies of the uma cluster as well as in the denser environment of virgo , it appears that this effect is independent of environment .",
    "new data from field nir surveys such as panstarrs and ukidss ( e.g. , smith et  al .",
    "2008 ) will be needed to revisit this question for field galaxies ( provided careful assessment of completeness for field samples ) .",
    "we now entertain possible physical interpretations for structural bimodality .",
    "dressler ( 1980 ) first demonstrated the existence of strong correlations between various galaxy properties and environment .",
    "red sequence galaxies live preferentially in dense environments , whilst blue , star - forming galaxies are predominantly found in isolation .",
    "this dependence on environment was reinforced as a major cause for the observed sdss color and star formation bimodality .",
    "not surprisingly , the local density of galaxies causes a strong morphological bias . merging and tidal interactions , which are more common in dense environments ( moss & whittle 1993 ; gnedin 2003 ) , can deplete the gas content of spiral and irregular galaxies , turning them into ellipticals and possibly s0s ( toomre & toomre 1972 ; farouki & shapiro 1981 ; barnes 1999 ) .",
    "an intracluster gas can also strip gas from late - type galaxies , reducing star formation drastically ( gunn & gott 1972 ) .",
    "processes such as galaxy - galaxy harassment , tidal stripping , and starvation , which are more efficient in dense environments , will all reduce the amount of active star formation .",
    "it is then not surprising that there should be a correlation between color , star formation and environment in this context .",
    "there are also several properties for the dark halo that appear to be dependent on environment .",
    "the mass , shape , spin and formation time of dark matter halos formed in denser environments that become clusters or filaments appear to be significantly different than those formed in isolation ( hahn et  al .",
    "simulations suggest that galaxy halos with masses m @xmath148 m@xmath149 , where m@xmath149 is the galaxy halo mass at which the mass function turns over , have parameters that correlate strongly with environment , while those with m @xmath150 m@xmath149 do not .",
    "hahn et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) find that low mass halos are older and have higher angular momenta when formed in proto - cluster environments , while low mass halos in the field form later and have lower angular momenta .",
    "the dependence of halo properties on environment could explain part of the observed differences in cluster and field galaxies .    however , using a sample of 329 nearby cluster and field star forming galaxies , vogt et  al .  ( 2004 ) failed to find any correlation between stellar mass - to - light ratios or circular velocities with environment .",
    "more observational and theoretical studies of environmental effects on galaxies will be needed .",
    "we have found so far that the gas - poor and the gas - rich uma and virgo cluster galaxies each exhibit a surface brightness bimodality .",
    "it is unclear whether this result is unique to clusters , since there is no complimentary nir survey of field galaxies that reaches the same depth in surface brightness .",
    "however , uma very much resembles the field due to its low density ( see tv97 ) , whilst virgo is a much richer cluster , suggesting that environment may not play a strong role .",
    "this surprising result requires an explanation which current models of galaxy formation fail to provide .",
    "however , our results may suggest routes for further investigation and allow the rejection of certain hypotheses .",
    "we now address various explanations for the structural bimodality in light of the available data and current theoretical ideas .    1 .",
    "_ stellar populations _ : previous studies based on sdss imaging for very large number of galaxies have shown bimodal distributions of color and star formation rate ( e.g. , strateva et  al .  2001 ) , which is largely the result of two galaxy populations : blue , star - forming spiral galaxies and red , quiescent spheroidal galaxies .",
    "we showed in  4.5 that color is uncorrelated with the observed surface brightness bimodalities of cluster galaxies ; stellar populations are thus unlikely to be a factor .",
    "lsb formation enhanced in clusters _ : if the structural bimodality is only present in clusters , it could result from more efficient tidal torquing in dense environments ( barnes & efstathiou 1987 ; bett et  al .  2007 ;",
    "hahn et  al .",
    "if dark matter halos acquire more angular momentum in a proto - cluster environment , then lsb galaxies ( which halt their collapse early due to high angular momentum ) would preferentially be formed in these dense environments . in this scenario",
    ", higher surface brightness galaxies could form from the merging of lower sb galaxies if they contain gas that can dissipate energy before forming stars .",
    "one would thus expect a `` smearing '' of the lsb peak towards hsb , but a discrete gap is still unaccounted for .",
    "it has been well documented that there is a maximum surface brightness that galaxy disks will not exceed ( freeman 1970 ) .",
    "if this maximal disk surface density is obeyed , then galaxies which evolve at various rates from low to high surface brightnesses via merging may ultimately halt their evolution at a disk surface density equal to the freeman value , thus enhancing the hsb peak .",
    "this scenario does not preclude the formation of isb galaxies via the merging of two lsb galaxies or other such events , but simply suggests that the isb case might be a rapid transition stage for galaxies as they merge and evolve towards the freeman limit .",
    "indeed , we do not see an absence of isb galaxies in clusters , but rather a relative excess of hsb and lsb galaxies .",
    "+ our group is currently studying the velocity function ( and thus the distribution of angular momenta ) of virgo cluster galaxies which will provide further insight into this problem . more studies like that of hahn et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) would help elucidate the role of environment on the distribution of various dynamical properties .",
    "3 .   _ specific stable radial configurations _ : expanding upon the ideas of mestel ( 1963 ) , tv97 suggested that galaxy disks could settle into one of two stable radial configurations : disks with a dynamically important baryonic component in the center and those without ( also known as maximal and minimal disks ) .",
    "they suggested that intermediate surface brightness galaxies are transient phenomena in high - density environments where interactions re - arrange the baryons .",
    "this is supported by the fact that , in uma , most intermediate surface brightness galaxies have significant neighbors and thus the bimodality is enhanced for isolated systems .",
    "however , the lack of isb galaxies in the densest regions of the virgo cluster suggests the opposite result .",
    "+ if the structural bimodality is unaffected by environment then there may be a more fundamental mechanism preventing the stability of isb galaxies .",
    "the isb regime may correspond to an unstable dynamical configuration , possibly implying a bimodality in the spin parameter , @xmath151 , for disk galaxies .",
    "4 .   _ gas depletion in clusters halts evolution _ :",
    "the amount of gas retained by cluster and field galaxies differ due to various factors such as high frequency of tidal interactions in clusters ( moss & whittle 1993 ; gnedin 2003 ) and the dense intracluster medium which can cause gas stripping ( gunn & gott 1972 ) .",
    "if isb galaxies form primarily via passive evolution and hsb galaxies form primarily via mergers , then the cluster environment would act to prevent lsb - to - isb evolution and enhance lsb - to - hsb evolution .    without being able to pinpoint the role that environment plays in the observed structural bimodalities , it is difficult to provide an explanation for their existence .",
    "it is likely that no single hypothesis above fully explains the surface brightness bimodality and that the separate bimodalities in early - type and late - type galaxies will require their own explanations ( although their alignment and equal spacing , as seen in table [ sbtable ] , suggests something fundamentally similar ! ) .",
    "it is difficult to speculate further without a proper analysis of the distribution of @xmath56 for field galaxies , a complimentary dynamical analysis of the virgo cluster , as well as detailed numerical simulations for the effects of external processes , such as tidal stripping and mergers , or internal processes , such as outflows , on surface brightness profiles of cluster and field galaxies .",
    "we have constructed the deepest complete sample of near - ir photometry of virgo cluster galaxies to date and with it , we were able to achieve a detailed analysis of the distribution of surface brightness profiles and luminosities for 286 virgo cluster galaxies .",
    "we also extracted @xmath37 photometry from the sdss for comparative analysis with a larger sample of 742 vcc galaxies .",
    "this virgo cluster study also follows from our re - analysis of similar data for the smaller uma cluster ( mcdonald et  al .",
    "our main findings are :    * there exists a structural bimodality in each of the early and late type galaxy populations of the uma and virgo clusters . from nir images of these galaxies ,",
    "we observe surface brightness peaks at @xmath94=21.7 @xmath11 and @xmath94=19.7 @xmath11 for late - type galaxies , and @xmath94=19.7 @xmath11 and @xmath94=17.8 mag arcsec@xmath6 for early - type galaxies .",
    "these three peaks are independent at a confidence level @xmath15290% . * the observed structural bimodalities in each galaxy class ( early or late ) is independent of the observed color bimodality . *",
    "the nir luminosity function for virgo has a prominent dip at intermediate luminosities which is also seen , to a lesser extent , in the optical sdss data .",
    "the fact that the dichotomy between hsb and lsb galaxies is independent of color and morphology implies a possible dynamical connection .",
    "we have detected a weak , but non - negligible , correlation between @xmath153 and @xmath56 , but more data will be needed to strengthen any dependence .",
    "the range of densities from uma to virgo also suggests that the mechanism for producing hsb and lsb galaxies is independent of environment . without a sample of true field galaxies it would , however , be unwise to speculate about any environmental effect on @xmath56 .",
    "unfortunately , current studies of the distribution of surface brightnesses of field galaxies are either hampered by dust extinction in the optical or have not achieved deep and complete enough coverage at nir wavelengths .",
    "thus , most reasonable scenarios for field / cluster galaxy evolution are still plausible .    the most obvious and relevant test for the hypothesis of different @xmath151-distributions in cluster and field environments , as proposed by hahn et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) , is to assemble a complete sample of resolved rotation curves for cluster galaxies .",
    "this would enable new constraints on the distribution of the spin parameter , @xmath151 , which may be responsible for setting @xmath56 ( e.g. , dutton et  al .",
    "hahn et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) predict a distribution that is skewed towards high values of @xmath151 in clusters and filaments . a complete sample of resolved dynamical data for cluster and field galaxies should allow a full assessment of the observed structural bimodality in terms of unbiased parameters such as dynamical mass and the slope of the rotation curve .",
    "it has been over ten years since the discovery of the surface brightness dichotomy in disk galaxies by tv97 .",
    "we have now extended that study to a broader environment to establish the presence of three separate peaks in the distribution of effective surface brightnesses in all galaxies with @xmath15290% confidence , and two peaks in the distribution of disk central surface brightnesses in disk galaxies with 95% confidence .",
    "the next few years should see significant improvements in the size and scope ( e.g. , range of surface brightness ) of galaxy nir surveys and in studies into the effect of environment on @xmath56 .",
    "the theoretical interpretation for these results however awaits a better determination of @xmath151 for galaxies in the field and in clusters , and a better interpretation of the combined effects of merging and stripping to the overall surface brightness of galaxies .",

    "in order to characterize the intrinsic distribution of structural parameters such as @xmath56 , @xmath47 and @xmath51 , free from evolutionary effects , we have generated a monte carlo suite of idealized galaxy models using combinations of a large number of model parameters . a single galaxy light profile can be determined with 8 basic parameters . for the bulge and disk ,",
    "the parameters @xmath162 , r@xmath163 , @xmath164 , r@xmath165 and srsic @xmath49 are selected randomly from gaussian distributions whose widths match roughly observed galaxy distributions .",
    "another 2 parameters govern the location and brightness of spiral arms .",
    "the location of the arms varies from 1 to 2 disk scale lengths and the peak arm brightnesses ranges from 0.3 to 0.5 @xmath11 above the disk brightness .",
    "finally , all model profiles were convolved with a gaussian function to simulate the effect of atmospheric blur ; the seeing fwhm is our 8th model parameter .",
    "we have also forced 1 in every 5 profiles to be a pure - sersic function to reflect the presence of systems with no disk .",
    "the gaussian distribution of input parameters for our models is shown in the top 6 panels of .    in order to infuse more realism into this experiment ,",
    "two different types of error were added to the model profiles : photon ( galaxy + sky ) random noise and systematic sky subtraction error .",
    "we determined the appropriate photon noise in the h - band from the distribution of measured surface brightness errors for our h - band images ( mcdonald et  al .",
    "2009 ) . from this distribution ,",
    "an error function was determined to add cosmic error to our model surface brightness profiles :    @xmath166    this result is very similar to that produced by courteau ( 1996 ) for @xmath2-band surface brightness profiles . a typical noise value @xmath167 now is added randomly to each model profile at each surface brightness level .    in order to simulate sky - subtraction errors , a systematic `` measurement error ''",
    "was first determined .",
    "this value is @xmath168 of the sky brightness at h-band.this random sky error can artificially produce truncated ( over - subtracted sky ) or upbending ( under - subtracted sky ) surface brightness profiles , depending on its sign .",
    "we have generated model galaxies by combining the 8 model parameters , each selected randomly from a realistic range of values , and accounting for random and systematic errors .",
    "the recovered parameter distribution for the 100,000 simulated surface brightness profiles can be seen in the lower 3 panels of for the total galaxy light .",
    "the @xmath56 distribution is nearly gaussian with a peak slightly brighter than the disk @xmath56 peak due to the inclusion of substantial bulges in most profiles .",
    "an hsb tail can be seen in the @xmath56 distribution due to severely bulge - dominated systems .",
    "these systems have higher @xmath56 values since bulges typically have higher surface brightnesses than disks .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath47 parameter is a combination of bulge and disk components ; the peak is controlled by the bulge @xmath47 for bulge - dominated systems and the tail is due to disk - dominated systems .",
    "finally , there is a strong peak in the @xmath51 distribution near @xmath51=2.8 , the expectation value for pure - disk systems .",

    "@xmath51 values cover the full range from 1.5 to 6.5 , in excellent agreement with our data ( see ) .    with our realistic model surface brightness profiles",
    ", we can trace the effects of sky measurement errors .",
    "this is important since such errors can drastically affect the shape of the density profile , causing an artificial truncation or anti - truncation at large radii .",
    "the distribution of total @xmath56 could thus be biased as a result . in",
    ", we show the effect of increasing the sky measurement error from @xmath440.001% to @xmath440.05% .",
    "the net effect of a positive sky error is to pull lsb galaxies below the sky noise yielding a faint tail , but the bright sb peak never shifts .",
    "shows the variations in @xmath56 due to over- and under - subtracted sky errors .",
    "an under - subtraction error ( upper half ) rarely affects the measured @xmath56 by more than 0.2 @xmath11 .",
    "an over - subtraction error ( lower half ) has a more drastic effect as it can shift a significant part of the outer disk below observable levels .",
    "recall that , while these tests about sky errors can be illuminating , the measured h - band sky error is typically @xmath440.005% and the effect of a systematic sky error is thus minimal .",
    "our simulations confirm that if the input structural parameters are distributed normally , we should expect a nearly normal distribution of effective surface brightnesses . under no conditions",
    "can we generate a distribution of @xmath56 that deviates significantly from the normal function .",
    "this result can be used as an unbiased comparison against galaxy structural parameters extracted from real data .",
    "the study of the distribution of galaxy structural parameters from light profiles can benefit greatly from the availability of dynamical information .",

    "this claim , and other correlations between dynamical and photometric parameters , resolved rotation curves would be ideal . failing any information about the shape of the rotation curves , we resort to 1d measures of maximum rotational velocity .",
    "provided sufficient accuracy , they can , at least , enable global comparisons with light profile parameters for the spiral galaxies in our sample .",
    "we retrieved data for 58 vcc galaxies from the extragalactic distance database ( edd ; http://edd.ifa.hawaii.edu/ ) which overlap with our h - band sample .",
    "these data have been corrected for aperture and turbulent effects following tully & fouqu ( 1985 ) who defined the linewidth parameter @xmath172 .",
    "we have also verified that the linear ( almost 1-to-1 ) relation between radio and optically measured line widths observed by courteau ( 1997 ) and others is also observed in this sample .",

    "@xmath178 is the maximum rotation velocity resulting from a purely baryonic system , while @xmath179 is the observed rotation speed ( which includes dark matter ) at a fiducial radius . tv97 postulate that lsb galaxies tend to be dominated by dark matter all the way into the innermost regions ( @xmath180 ) while hsb galaxies are baryon - dominated within roughly two disk scale lengths ( @xmath181 ; e.g. , courteau & rix 1997 ; d07 ) .      where @xmath183 refers to the luminosity within the radius , @xmath184 , and @xmath185 is the stellar mass - to - light ratio computed using sdss colors and bell et  al .",
    "the peak value of v@xmath186 is the value we call v@xmath149 .",
