    "hirota s @xmath0-soliton solution of the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation @xcite was characterised in terms of a bcklund transformation originally by wahlquist and estabrook in @xcite . nowadays",
    "the close relationship between soliton solutions and bcklund transformations is a part of the landscape of soliton theory .    the discrete systems which form the natural analogues of integrable partial differential equations of kdv - type are the scalar multidimensionally consistent quadrilateral lattice equations .",
    "amongst the features which are more transparent on the level of the discrete equations is the bcklund transformation , in fact a natural auto - bcklund transformation is inherent in the discrete equation itself because of the multidimensional consistency .",
    "this is helpful in defining the very notion of soliton solution in the discrete setting , where the usual physical properties attributed to these solutions are less well studied .",
    "it also makes the solutions arising from iterative application of the bcklund transformation very well suited to a treatment on the discrete level .",
    "particularly ( we have found ) when combined with an elementary technique for solving the riccati equation , which we now take a moment to explain .    in the scalar case the discrete riccati equation ( _ riccati map _ ) is an equation of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are values of the dependent variable @xmath5 as a function of the independent variable @xmath6 , and in general the equation is non - autonomous so that the _ coefficients _ @xmath7 are functions of @xmath8 .",
    "one of the many interesting properties of this equation is as follows : given two particular solutions @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the substitution @xmath11 reduces ( [ gr ] ) to a homogeneous linear equation for the new variable @xmath12 .",
    "specifically @xmath13 as a consequence of the vanishing of the first and last terms in the expansion @xmath14 this technique has been applied to the riccati map associated with the lattice bcklund transformation previously @xcite . in the present communication",
    "we show that a similar technique applied to the superposition principle makes it possible to construct a closed - form expression for the solution found by the application of @xmath0 bcklund transformations .",
    "in other words , it leads to an expression for the @xmath0-soliton - type solutions .    from classification results due to adler ,",
    "bobenko and suris ( abs ) @xcite there has emerged a core list of canonical forms for the scalar multidimensionally consistent quadrilateral lattice equations .",
    "with one notable exception , explicit @xmath0-soliton solutions have been found for all of the equations on the abs list @xcite , and their relation to the bcklund transformation has also been examined @xcite . the exception is the lattice equation discovered by adler @xcite ( cf . also @xcite ) , which acquired the name @xmath1 in @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 holds the position as the primary model on the abs list because all of the others can be found from this single equation by a process of degeneration .",
    "the principal application of the technique developed here is therefore to @xmath1 , for which an explicit @xmath0-soliton solution has not ( to our knowledge ) hitherto been given .",
    "we start in section [ class ] by specifying the class of equations under consideration . in section",
    "[ simplified ] the bcklund transformation and superposition principle of a generic equation within this class are written in terms of the associated variable @xmath15 .",
    "the iterative application of the bcklund transformation in this new variable then leads to the main @xmath0-soliton formula in section [ iteration ] . in section [ a1sol ]",
    "we provide a simple illustrative example , using equation @xmath16 from @xcite . in section [ q4sol ] we use the @xmath0-soliton formula to exhibit an explicit @xmath0-soliton solution of @xmath1 , this builds on the seed and one - soliton solution constructed for this equation previously in @xcite .",
    "we will study an equation of a generic form which encompasses all of those listed by abs in @xcite . specifically",
    ", we consider a polynomial of degree one in four scalar variables , @xmath17 in which the coefficients are functions of _ lattice parameters _ @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we assume the _ kleinian symmetry _ and _ covariance _ of the polynomial , @xmath20 as well as compatibility of the system @xmath21 for any @xmath22 and @xmath23 . by the compatibility of ( [ concon ] )",
    "we mean that given @xmath5 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 satisfying the equations on the left , the remaining equations on the right are all satisfied by the _",
    "same _ value of @xmath30 .",
    "it is from the polynomial @xmath31 that we then define an autonomous _ quadrilateral lattice equation _ , @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are now values of the dependent variable @xmath5 as a function of independent variables @xmath37 .",

    "seems less natural @xcite . ]",
    "we are interested in the solutions of ( [ ge ] ) constructed by the application of @xmath0 consecutive bcklund transformations to an initial _ seed _ solution .",
    "to apply the riccati solution technique we will presuppose that the seed solution admits _",
    "covariant extension_.    [ ce ] a covariantly extended solution of ( [ ge ] ) is one which also satisfies the ( compatible ) equations    [ as ] @xmath38    for all @xmath39 .    in this definition",
    "we have introduced shift operators @xmath40 associated with new lattice parameters @xmath41 , so the requirement is that @xmath5 inhabits an @xmath42-dimensional lattice satisfying the equations ( [ ge ] ) and ( [ as ] ) throughout .",
    "we remark that situations in which there is no _ natural _ covariant extension are conceivable .",
    "however , covariant - extendibility is not a restriction because generically , given a solution of ( [ ge ] ) , the multidimensional consistency implies that solutions of the equations ( [ as ] ) exist . )",
    "arising as @xmath0-cycles of the bcklund transformation - which are a discrete analogue of finite - gap solutions @xcite , _ do _ have a natural covariant extension ( cf . the example in section [ q4sol ] ) . on the other hand , for solutions which result from a generic initial value problem on the lattice ,",
    "a natural covariant extension is not manifest . ]",
    "we give a definition of the ( extended ) bcklund transformation of ( [ ge ] ) .",
    "[ bt ] when two functions @xmath5 and @xmath43 satisfy the system of equations    [ bt ] @xmath44    we say they are related by the bcklund transformation of ( [ ge ] ) with bcklund parameter @xmath23 , and write @xmath45 .",
    "one usually considers only the two - dimensional system ( [ btpq ] ) in the definition of the bcklund transformation , but here we have included auxiliary equations so that the bcklund transformation preserves the covariant extension .",
    "the following statement is locally equivalent to the assumption of multidimensional consistency described in section [ class ] .",
    "[ bl1 ] if @xmath5 is a covariantly extended solution of ( [ ge ] ) then considered as a system of equations for @xmath43 the bcklund equations @xmath46 are compatible .",
    "moreover the function @xmath43 which emerges is again a covariantly extended solution of ( [ ge ] ) .",
    "now , the special choice of bcklund parameter @xmath47 causes an interplay between the bcklund transformation and the covariant extension , and it is this which facilitates the riccati solution technique .",
    "[ fl ] let @xmath5 be a covariantly extended solution of ( [ ge ] ) .",
    "then for each @xmath48 the substitution @xmath49u}{1-\\eta_i } \\label{subi}\\ ] ] reduces the bcklund equations @xmath50 to the following compatible homogeneous linear system for the new variable @xmath51 ,    [ etasys ] @xmath52    the covariant extension provides two particular solutions of the system @xmath53 , namely @xmath54 immediately from ( [ as ] ) , and @xmath55 , which can be seen by applying @xmath56 to ( [ as ] ) and using the symmetry ( [ klein ] ) .",
    "now observe that , considered as equations for @xmath43 , the bcklund transformation ( [ bt ] ) is a system of compatible riccati maps because of the assumption ( [ al ] ) .",
    "the substitution ( [ subi ] ) can then be seen to bring @xmath50 to ( [ etasys ] ) by considering an expansion of the form ( [ rexpand ] ) on each equation .",
    "the compatibility of ( [ etasys ] ) is inherited .",
    "we remark that the behaviour of @xmath51 and @xmath57 away from the origin in the lattice direction associated with shift @xmath58 is likely to be quite special . actually in practice",
    "we will only use the covariant extension of @xmath57 and @xmath51 into the remaining lattice directions associated with shifts @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "let us turn now to consider the superposition principle for solutions of ( [ ge ] ) related by the bcklund transformation .",
    "again we state the following without proof because it is a standard calculation based on the multidimensional consistency .",
    "[ bl2 ] let @xmath5 be a covariantly extended solution of ( [ ge ] ) and suppose @xmath61 and @xmath62 are such that @xmath63 and @xmath64 for some @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "then the function @xmath67 determined algebraically by the equation @xmath68 satisfies the bcklund relations @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "this brings us to the crux of the method , it lies in considering lemma [ bl2 ] in the case that @xmath71 . the resulting interplay with the covariant extension ( in which @xmath41 play the role of lattice parameters , cf .",
    "definition [ ce ] ) leads to a relation , derived from the superposition formula , connecting now @xmath15-variables associated with each bcklund transformation .",

    "first we observe that @xmath78 for all @xmath39 . in the case",
    "@xmath79 this is immediate from the covariant extension ( [ as2 ] ) , the other cases follow from the symmetry ( [ klein ] ) . by combining ( [ qij ] ) with the affine - linearity ( [ al ] ) we have for each @xmath80 and each pair @xmath39 @xmath81 as an identity in @xmath82 . here",
    "we have introduced a polynomial @xmath83 of degree one in three variables defined in terms of @xmath31 as @xmath84 this new polynomial inherits the symmetry @xmath85 from the covariance of @xmath31 ( [ covar ] ) .",
    "the simplification which occurs by using ( [ qs ] ) to replace occurrences of @xmath31 with @xmath83 will be the principal mechanism exploited in the calculation .",
    "now , according to lemma [ fl ] the assumption ( [ imp1 ] ) means that each @xmath51 satisfies ( [ etasys ] ) . using ( [ qs ] ) in ( [ etace ] ) as well as in the equation found by applying @xmath86 to ( [ etace ] ) , we are able to deduce the following simplified equations for shifts on @xmath51 into the extended lattice directions , @xmath87 which hold for all pairs @xmath39",
    ". the relations ( [ etasimp ] ) combined with ( [ ssym ] ) may be used to directly verify the property ( [ eta_property ] ) .",
    "we now proceed with the principal calculation ; substituting for @xmath57 and @xmath88 leads to the following expansion of the superposition formula @xmath89 the first equality here results from substituting for @xmath57 and @xmath88 using the equation on the left of ( [ imp1 ] ) and exploiting the assumed affine - linearity of @xmath31 ( [ al ] ) . to get the second equality from the first we have used ( [ qs ] ) .",
    "the third equality follows from the second by using ( [ etasimp ] ) whilst bearing in mind ( [ ssym ] ) .",
    "the expansion ( [ ijexp ] ) thus enables us to write an expression for the ( covariantly extended ) solution of ( [ ge ] ) determined from @xmath5 , @xmath57 and @xmath88 by the superposition formula @xmath90 , @xmath91u}{1-({\\mathsf{t}}_j^{-1}\\eta_i)-({\\mathsf{t}}_i^{-1}\\eta_j)+({\\mathsf{t}}_j\\eta_i)({\\mathsf{t}}_i^{-1}\\eta_j)}.\\label{duij}\\ ] ] it is easily verified that the expression for @xmath75 in ( [ sp2 ] ) leads to equality between @xmath92 given on the left of ( [ imp2 ] ) and @xmath92 found by superposition in ( [ duij ] ) .",
    "the statement ( [ imp2 ] ) therefore follows from lemma [ bl2 ] .",
    "thus it is demonstrated that , beyond what might be expected , the function @xmath75 is determined completely in terms of @xmath51 and @xmath93 by an expression ( [ sp2 ] ) which does not depend on the particular form of the polynomial @xmath31 .",
    "the additional statement of lemma [ ml ] , ( [ eta_property ] ) , can be viewed as encoding the permutability of the bcklund transformations ( specifically @xmath94 in ( [ imp2 ] ) ) as a property of the @xmath15-variables ; this property will also play a key role later .",
    "here we apply @xmath0 consecutive bcklund transformations to a covariantly extended seed solution of ( [ ge ] ) . choosing the bcklund parameters to coincide with the lattice parameters @xmath41 of the covariant extension ( cf .",
    "definition [ ce ] ) renders the bcklund iteration scheme tractable and yields a closed - form expression for the resulting @xmath0-soliton - type solution . in the main theorem which follows",
    "it is both convenient and ( as will be seen ) natural to introduce a solution @xmath43 and functions @xmath95 which are shifted versions of the seed solution @xmath5 and the variables @xmath72 of section [ simplified ] .    given a covariantly extended solution of ( [ ge ] ) denoted by @xmath5 , let @xmath96u \\label{vdef}\\ ] ] and for each @xmath48 suppose the function @xmath97 satisfies the system    [ phisys ] @xmath98    then the linear difference operators @xmath99 defined as @xmath100 commute amongst each other , and the function @xmath101 defined in terms of these operators by the expression @xmath102v}{\\big[{\\textstyle \\prod_{i=1}^n{\\mathsf{b}}_i}\\big]1 } , \\label{nss}\\ ] ] is a solution of ( [ ge ] ) related to @xmath5 by the composition of @xmath0 bcklund transformations with bcklund parameters @xmath41 .",
