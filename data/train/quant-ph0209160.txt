    "recently a multisymplectic twelve points scheme was produced @xcite .",
    "this scheme is equivalent to the multisymplectic preissmann scheme and is applied to solitary waves over long time interval .",

    "gives the opportunity to use it for different applications like cauchy problems for arbitrary number of equations and a wide class of initial conditions @xmath2 ( x , 0 ) .",
    "we consider in our problem an infinite domain while the initial condition goes quickly enough to zero following the relation @xmath5 keeping in mind the choice of smooth and integrable function . as an important corollary of the theorem one obtains conditions that have to be taken in account in choosing grid sizes .",

    "we introduce the difference scheme for arbitrary number of coupled kdv equations .",
    "we investigate stability and prove the convergence giving the condition have to be taken in account in choosing the grid sizes and how they are related . in section 3",
    "we analyze hs system with two - parameters one - soliton explicit solution .",
    "the numerical method is applied to hs system and compared with the explicit solution .",
    "we analyzed the effects of the two parameters and initial condition on the form of the resulting solitons as will as on accuracy and show the results by figures .",
    "we also produced ( numerically ) a multi - soliton solution for hs system and used the conservation law to estimate the expected number of solitons which agreed that we already obtained .",
    "proving stability and convergence besides testing the results for hs system allows us in section 4 to use scheme for general ckdv system .",
    "hence we illustrate by plots the results of applying the scheme to slightly nonintegrable ckdv systems and other for a system with non - smooth initial conditions .",
    "for the ckdv system ( 1 ) we introduce a numerical ( finite - difference ) method of solution . a scheme which is two steps three time levels similar to the lax - wendroff one @xcite .",
    "the usual lax - wendroff is modified such that the order of the first derivative becomes of order @xmath6 .",

    "is elaborated applying lax idea for a half time step and leap frog method to the remaining half time step . in both steps @xmath12",
    "are replaced by forth order @xmath13 and second order accurate @xmath14 central difference expressions .",
    "hence ( 3 ) gives the following difference scheme @xmath15 where n , m , k are the modes numbers ; i and j are discrete space and time respectively .",
    "the time step @xmath9 is replaced for simplicity by t while h denotes spatial step .",
    "the equation ( 4.1 ) is accompanied with discrete equation for the intermediate layer as : + @xmath16      for simplicity of the analysis we start by considering one equation of the system and give the details of stability and convergence .",
    "then we apply the idea to the general ckdv system because it is rather close to that for one kdv equation but more bulky .",
    "consider one kdv equation of the system ( 1 ) @xmath17 note again that the investigation we perform can be generalized for the case of any finite number of modes .",
    "considering the numerical scheme applied for the equation ( 5 ) @xmath18    let us select a suitable norm .",
    "for this multiply equation equation ( 5 ) by @xmath19 and integrate to yield + @xmath20 hence , by definition of @xmath21 norm,@xmath22 , it may be written as  @xmath23 const .",
    ", i.e. the norm @xmath24 is conserved and the equation can be treated in the @xmath21 norm .",
    "now we will prove stability with respect to small perturbations ( because we consider nonlinear equations ) of initial conditions . strictly speaking it is the boundness of the discrete solution in terms of small perturbation of the initial data .",
    "so let us consider the differential @xmath25 for equation ( 5 ) denoting @xmath26 and use @xmath27 .",
    "+ rewrite also the relation ( 7 ) in the matrix form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a small perturbation of initial data and the subscripts are omitted for simplicity .",
    "stability requires the boundedness of the product @xmath30  in a sense that the norm @xmath31 is bounded by some constant , i.e. @xmath32 . here @xmath33 is a constant , and the matrix norm is a spectral norm . for this",
    "the sufficient condition is  @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a constant , that is independent of @xmath36 .",
    "the case @xmath37 is a sufficient condition of stability also , but only if @xmath38 . if @xmath39 , including @xmath36 , @xmath40 , for some dependence @xmath41 , then we can say about conditional stability .",

    "the scheme is stable if @xmath51 in spite of @xmath52 @xmath53 this is a conditional stability of the scheme .",
    "it means that it is required for stability that @xmath54 more faster than @xmath40 ,  or    @xmath55    therefore , for small enough @xmath36 we can simplify the expression for a    @xmath56    in practical calculations the time step @xmath36 should be chosen so that it would satisfy  @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the time of simulation ( @xmath59 ) . in future ,",
    "when we shall be suggesting some better numerical scheme , we will essentially use our observation that stability depends only on the dispersion terms .",
    "and now we will try to accomplish our short investigation of the scheme ( 6 ) by strong proving of the numerical scheme convergence .",
    "now we prove that a solution of equation ( 6 ) converges to a solution of ( 5 ) , if the exact solution is a continuously - differentiable one .",
    "let us denote by @xmath60 a solution of the equation ( 5 ) .",
    "we substitute @xmath61 @xmath62 into ( 6 ) ,  @xmath63 is a error between the difference solution @xmath64 and the exact solution @xmath65 .",
    "we obtain the equation for @xmath63 @xmath66 let us take into account that @xmath67 using the operator @xmath68 introduced above , this equation may be rewritten in the form @xmath69 the right part of this relation is a quantity of order @xmath70",
    "so , we can write @xmath71 or @xmath72 we finally arrive at the inequality that compare the norms : @xmath73 to explain how this estimate was obtained , follow the expressions @xmath74 using the schwartz inequality @xmath75 , the formulas ( 10 ) could be transformed as @xmath76 to derive ( 12 ) , we have used the iteration of the first of formula ( we substituted the formula into itself , but for index less than 1 ) and using ( 11 ) .",
    "then we have utilized the formula for a sum of geometric series .",
    "farther the inequality obtained in ( 12 ) has a solution @xmath77 if we take into account ( 9 ) , and use@xmath78we obtain @xmath79 the constant @xmath80 is bounded , in spite of @xmath81 , because of @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , the convergence is proved .",
    "the numerical scheme for the system of the ckdv ( 4.1)-(4.2 ) is also conditionally stable and convergent one .",
    "the proof for this scheme is close to that given before , but a bit bulky .",
    "we deal with a vector : @xmath83 as a dependent variable instead of the simple variable @xmath84 in the case of one kdv . for this vector case",
    "the norm used has the form @xmath85 the conditions connecting time and space steps for this scheme look also similar but with different constants @xmath86",
    "the numerical method is tested by applying it to hirota - satsuma system .",
    "namely the two parameters one - soliton explicit solution is used @xcite .      darboux transformation ( dt )",
    "that account a deep reduction for this specific hs case of ckdv is used @xcite to obtain explicit solutions to hs system .",
    "the lax representation of the hs equations is based on the matrix 2x2 spectral problem of the second order . for this problem",
    "the deep reduction scheme @xcite is applied ( with the help of the conserved bilinear - forms ) and supports the constrains on the potential while the iterated dt are performed .",
    "the iterated dt in determinant form and the covariance of the bilinear forms with respect to dt under restrictions gives n soliton solution of hs system .",
    "the system of hs we use to check the scheme has the form : @xmath87 @xmath88 this system has two - parameters one soliton solution : @xmath89 with real constants m , d. for small @xmath90 this solution is a smooth function but for @xmath91 poles appear .the following figures show some choice of m and d to show the effect of these two parameters on the solution . figure 1 show that , for constant d , the amplitude is proportional to m while the wave width is inversely proportional to it .",
    "figure 2 show that , for the given m , d affects on soliton shape , namely the first mode , while the amplitude of the second is inversely proportional to d.     + fig .",
    "1 . for a constant d ,",
    "the amplitude is proportional to m while the wave width is inversely proportional to m.     + fig .",
    "2 . for the same m",
    ", d affects on soliton shape , namely the first mode , while the amplitude + of the second mode is inversely proportional to d.      hs system ( 13 ) is solved numerically using the scheme ( 4 ) with initial condition from formula ( 14)(t = 0 ) and the results are compared with the explicit solution .",
    "it is found that , keeping the restriction on the choice of @xmath92 and relation between them , the initial wave modes amplitude affects on the accuracy of the results . also the error decreases as the mesh is refined .",
    "namely smaller amplitude ( of order one ) gives better results as shown below in figure ( 3 ) .",
    "it gives the percentage error calculated as follow @xmath93 we relate the error to the initial amplitude to show the physical significance of the error .",
    "+   fig.3 % error is proportional to the amplitude(a ) .",
    "the plots show that the error is proportional to the amplitude ( a ) , where as shown in figure the maximum relative error in the case ( a=2 ) is 1 % while in the case ( a=3.4 ) is 3 % .",
    "the reason may be due to the higher velocity in the larger one , hence more interactions impact .",
    "it also shows that the error increases near the peak points .",
    "the reason of these oscillations in plots appearance is that the numerical and analytical plots intersect over the space domain .",
    "stability analysis and checking performed to the scheme in the general ckdv equations give the ability of using this scheme to solve other problems for which analytical solutions have not been found .",
    "we first consider the multi - soliton solution decay of the localized initial condition for the single kdv equation of hs system ( figure 4.a ) then for the complete hs system ( figure 4.b ) . in",
    "both we use the initial condition from formula ( 14 ) but with 10 times the width and twice the amplitude .",
    "the second mode affects ( interacts ) the first one which results in the right direction soliton - like `` tail '' as shown in the figure 4.b .",
    "we estimate , using the conservation low ( derived below ) , the expected number of solitons that already obtained in the numerical solution as + @xmath94+\\frac{d}{dx}[-.5 \\theta_{1}^{3}-.25 \\theta_{1}\\theta_{1xx}+.125\\theta_{1x}^{2}-\\theta_{2}\\theta_{2xx } + .5\\theta_{2x}^{2}]=0 \\\\ \\theta_{1}\\,\\ and \\,\\ \\theta_{2 } \\rightarrow 0 \\,\\ as \\,\\ x \\rightarrow \\pm \\infty\\\\ \\int^{-\\infty}_{\\infty}{(.5 \\theta_{1}^{2}-\\theta_{2}^{2})dx}=const .",
