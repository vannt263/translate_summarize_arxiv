    "over the last few decades , wave dynamics in multicomponent plasmas has been a front area of research for the plasma community .",
    "various types of nonlinear waves namely , ion - acoustic waves ( iaws ) , electron - acoustic waves ( eaws ) etc . as well as",
    "nonlinear coherent structures associated with them namely , solitons , envelope solitons , shocks etc . have also been studied in different plasma environments .",
    "as is known , ion - acoustic waves are electrostatic plasma modes , where a population of inertial ions oscillate against a dominant thermalized background of electrons that provide necessary restoring force .",
    "the phase velocity of such waves lies between the electron and ion thermal velocities .",
    "plasmas with two groups of electrons ( e.g. , cool and hot electrons ) are very common in laboratories @xcite as well as in space environments @xcite . in this context",
    ", a large number of investigations have been made to study the characteristics of iaws in two - temperature electron plasmas @xcite .",
    "such two - temperature plasmas have been observed by various satellite missions , e.g. , fast auroral snapshot ( fast ) at the auroral region @xcite , viking satellite @xcite and themis mission @xcite .",
    "furthermore , several investigations made by geotail and polar @xcite in the magnetosphere have also confirmed the existence of such electron populations .",
    "@xcite reported experimentally the existence of ion acoustic solitary waves ( iasws ) in plasmas with hot and cold electrons .",
    "@xcite studied small - amplitude ion - acoustic solitons in a plasma with two - temperature kappa distributed electrons and found that superthermality of electrons played an important role for the modification of solitary structures .",
    "the linear properties of the iaws have been extensively studied and well understood in multi - component plasmas in presence of hot electrons obeying maxwellian and non - maxwellian velocity distributions .",
    "when the nonlinear effects are concerned , the formation of ion - acoustic solitons may be possible due to a delicate balance between the nonlinearity and the dispersion which also has been anticipated theoretically via the derivation of korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) or zakharov - kuznetsov ( zk ) equations for small - amplitude perturbations @xcite , and via the sagdeev potential formalism , accounting for the arbitrary amplitude excitations @xcite .",
    "existence of these nonlinear structures was experimentally confirmed @xcite .",
    "the space observations and laboratory experiments indicate the presence of particles which obey non - maxwellian velocity distributions in plasmas .",
    "the observations of the voyager pls @xcite have also shown the existence of both cool and hot electrons populations ( non - maxwellian ) in saturn s magnetosphere .",
    "one of such distributions as reported by @xcite and proposed by @xcite is the boltzmann - gibbs - shannon ( bgs ) entropy in which the degree of nonextensivity of the plasma particles is characterized by the entropic index @xmath5 , i.e. , the distribution function with @xmath6 , compared with the maxwellian one @xmath7 indicates the system with more superthermal particles ( superextensivity ) , whereas the @xmath5 distribution with @xmath8 is suitable for plasmas containing a large number low - speed particles ( subextensivity ) .",
    "however , because of long - range coulomb force between plasma particles and the presence of many superthermal particles in astrophysical and space environments a @xmath5-distribution with @xmath6 is strongly suggested for real plasmas or superthermal plasmas .",
    "such @xmath5-nonextensive distribution has been widely used to study various nonlinear coherent structures like solitons , double layers or shocks etc . @xcite .    the propagation of wave packets in a nonlinear",
    ", dispersive medium is subjected to the modulation of their wave amplitudes , i.e. , a slow variation of the wave packet s envelope due to the nonlinear self - interaction of the carrier wave modes .",
    "the system s evolution is then governed through the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation and the associated modulational instability ( mi ) .",
    "the latter in nonlinear , dispersive media has been a well - known mechanism for the localization of wave energy .",
    "furthermore , such instability results into the exponential growth of a small plane wave perturbation which leads to the amplification of the sidebands , and thereby breaking up the uniform wave into a train of oscillations .",
    "thus , the mi of wave packets in plasmas acts as a precursor for the formation of bright envelope solitons or highly energetic rogue waves ( rogons ) , otherwise the dark envelope solitons may be formed .",
    "the amplitude modulation of electrostatic waves in plasmas have been investigated by a number of authors owing to their importance in space , astrophysical and laboratory plasmas .",
    "a great deal of attention has been given to the @xmath9 of iaws in non - maxwellian plasmas .",
    "to mention few , @xcite investigated the amplitude modulation of dust - acoustic waves in dusty plasmas with superthermal ions .",
    "similar investigations have also been made of iaws in plasmas with two - temperature electrons @xcite and kappa - distributed superthermal electrons @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite studied the mi of ion - acoustic wave envelopes in a plasma containing non - extensive electrons .    on the other hand",
    ", the generation of highly energetic rogue waves ( or rogons ) in plasmas has been a topic of important research .",
    "such waves may also appear in other environments such as oceanic rogue waves @xcite , stock market crashes @xcite , optical rogue waves @xcite , super - fluid helium @xcite , bose - einstein condensates @xcite , atmospheric physics @xcite and opposing current flow @xcite .",
    "the rogue waves in plasmas may be generated due to wave - wave interactions @xcite , and their evolution can also be described by the nls equation for modulated wave packets .",
    "the rogue waves were first observed in a ocean @xcite . the space - time localized solution ( rational solution ) of the nls equation was determined and later recognized as peregrine solitons ( a prototype of rogue waves ) .",
    "the latter were also experimentally observed in different nonlinear dispersive media ( e.g. , optical fiber , plasma etc . ) . the possible mechanism to explain these waves include effects such as nonlinear focusing via mi in one space dimension .",
    "for some theoretical description of rogue waves readers are referred to ref .",
    "and some experimental observations to refs ..    we , however , mention that the physical mechanism behind the formation of rogue waves is still unclear , however , observations indicate that they have unusually steep , solitary or tightly grouped profiles , which appear like `` walls of water '' @xcite . a large number of theoretical and experimental investigations have been reported for the study of rogue waves in various plasma systems @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the nonlinear propagation of solitary and freak waves in a superthermal plasma with positive and negative ions , ion beam and stationary dust particles .",
    "more recently , @xcite have considered the propagation of dia rogue waves in superthermal plasmas and investigated the combined effects of superthermality and dust concentration on the characteristics of dia rogue waves .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the amplitude modulation of iaw packets in an unmagnetized plasma whose constituents are inertial cold positive ions and two - temperature ( cool and hot ) electrons obeying tsallis nonextensive @xmath5 distribution .",
    "the nonlinear evolution of these waves are governed by a nls equation which is used to study the mi of a stokes wave train to a small longitudinal perturbation .",
    "it is shown that the wave packets with long - wavelength modes @xmath0 are always stable , where s modes with @xmath10 gives rise the mi of iaws .",

    "[ vi ] is devoted to summarize and conclude the results .",
    "we consider the nonlinear propagation of iaws in a collisionless unmagnetized plasma consisting of @xmath5-nonextensive distributed cool and hot electrons ( to be denoted , respectively , by the subscripts @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) and singly charged inertial positive ions ( with charge @xmath13 and mass @xmath14 ) . at equilibrium",
    ", the overall charge neutrality condition reads @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the ratio between the cool electron and the ion number densities .",

    "furthermore , the space and the time variables are normalized by the debye length @xmath29 and the ion plasma period @xmath30 respectively . in eq .",
    ", the number densities @xmath31 and @xmath32 for cool and hot electrons @xmath33 are given by the following _ q_-nonextensive distributions @xcite @xmath34^{(1/2)+1/(q_j-1 ) } , \\label{nj}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 @xmath36 is a nonextensive parameter for cool ( hot ) electrons , measuring deviation from the maxwellian distribution with @xmath37 .    in the propagation of small but finite amplitude iaws , one must have @xmath38 .",
    "also , as mentioned in the introduction that a @xmath5 distribution with @xmath6 is strongly suggested for real plasma systems or superthermal plasmas .",
    "so , we take @xmath39 . thus , eq . can be binomially expanded ( retaining terms up to @xmath40 ) to obtain from eq .",

    "we employ a multiple - scale perturbation technique @xcite to derive the evolution equation of a slowly varying weakly nonlinear wave amplitude of iaw packets in a @xmath5 nonextensive plasma . here",

    "small deviations will be considered from the equilibrium state @xmath55 by taking @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a small positive parameter measuring the weakness of the wave amplitude . the wave amplitude is thus allowed to depend on the stretched ( slow ) coordinates of space and time as @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively , where @xmath60 ( viz .",

    "all the perturbed states depend on the fast scales via the phase @xmath65 only ( @xmath66 are the wave frequency and wave number respectively ) , whereas the slow scales only enter the @xmath67th harmonic amplitude @xmath68 .",

    "it is seen that the wave frequency increases slowly with @xmath85 , however , it decreases with increasing values of @xmath86 and @xmath84 .",

    ", we obtain a compatibility condition in the form @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the group velocity of the iaw packets given by @xmath92 clearly , the group velocity of the wave becomes constant in the long - wavelength limit @xmath93 .",
    "this implies that in a frame moving with the group velocity @xmath94 , the time derivatives of all physical quantities should vanish and thus one can observe a slow variation of the wave amplitude in the moving frame of reference . from eq .",

    "i.e. , @xmath141 or @xmath142 , the perturbations may develop into dark solitons which represent an electric potential envelope hole with finite or vanishing potential at the origin .",

    "i.e. , for @xmath10 , we will see from the numerical investigation that the waves are mostly modulationally unstable .",
    "since @xmath117 is always negative , the sign of @xmath160 , for which the stability and instability of the iaw envelopes can be determined , solely depends on the sign of @xmath118 .",
    "so , we numerically investigate the nonlinear coefficient @xmath118 for different values of the parameters @xmath86 and @xmath84 .",

    "it is seen that whatever be the values of the plasma parameters , @xmath118 is always positive in the limit @xmath93 ( i.e. , at long scale perturbations of the carrier modes ) as mentioned above , whereas it becomes negative for @xmath161 as well as for some intermediate values of @xmath85 in @xmath2 , i.e. at small and medium scale perturbations .",
    "it is also evident that @xmath118 becomes maximum ( hence the maximum growth rate of instability ) in the limit @xmath93 as mentioned before except for the case where @xmath162 increase from some positive values to the value @xmath163 ( see the dotted and dash - dotted lines in the lower panel ) in which @xmath118 can be maximum at an intermediate value of @xmath85 in the interval @xmath2 .",
    "typical behavior of @xmath118 ( in the case of @xmath164 ) shows that initially it drops down from its maximum value in the domain @xmath165 and then starts increasing in a small interval of @xmath166 , and again it decreases faster the larger is the wave number @xmath85 of carrier modes .",
    "however , as the values of the nonextensive parameters @xmath167 increase and approach a value @xmath163 ( i.e. , one approaches the maxwellian distribution of electrons ) @xmath118 initially increases in a small interval @xmath168 , and then it decreases faster with increasing values of @xmath85 . from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we also observe that as the parameters @xmath84 and @xmath83 get enhanced , the values of @xmath118 decrease , and the ranges of values of @xmath85 for which @xmath139 increase ( see the upper panel ) .",
    "the same are true for increasing values of @xmath3 ( see the lower panel ) , but decreasing values of @xmath4 [ except in the range where @xmath93 in which the value of @xmath118 increases with decreasing values of @xmath4 , however , the range of @xmath85 for which @xmath139 remains unaltered ( see the dotted and dash - dotted lines the lower panel ) ] .",
    "thus , from fig . [ fig1 ] we conclude that the iaw packets with short - wavelength carrier modes @xmath169 are always unstable with @xmath170 under the amplitude modulation with plane wave perturbation , it can also be unstable at the medium scale with @xmath85 lying in @xmath171 or more generally in @xmath2 . in these cases",

    "in this work , we have investigated the amplitude modulation of ion - acoustic wave ( iaw ) packets in an unmagnetized multi - component plasma consisting of singly charged positive ions and two - temperature electrons featuring nonextensive distributions . using the multiple - scale perturbation method , a nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation",
    "is derived which governs the evolution of iaw envelopes .",
    "this equation is then used to study the modulational instability ( mi ) of a stokes wave train to a small longitudinal perturbation .",
    "different stable and unstable regions of modulation in the range of the carrier wave number @xmath85 are found out with the variations of the plasma parameters , namely , the nonextensive indices @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the ratio of cool electron to ion number densities @xmath83 as well as the cool to hot electron temperature ratio @xmath84 .",
    "it follows that the modulated iaw packets can propagate in the form of bright envelope solitons or highly energetic rogue waves ( rogons ) due to mi as well as dark envelope solitons where the mi is excluded .",
    "the growth rate of instability together with the exact analytical solutions of the nls equation in the form of bright and dark envelope solitons as well as rogons are also obtained and their properties are examined numerically with the plasma parameters .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows :    * the fluid model governing the dynamics of small - amplitude iaws in multi - component electron - ion plasmas is valid for the plasma parameters satisfying @xmath233 , i.e. , plasmas with more superthermal electrons [ compared to the maxwellian ones @xmath234 and lower concentration of cold electrons than the positive ions . *",
    "the group velocity dispersive coefficient @xmath117 of the nls equation is always negative irrespective of the values of @xmath85 and the plasma parameters .",
    "however , the nonlinear coefficient @xmath118 is always negative for @xmath10 ( and any values of the parameters with @xmath233 ) and can become positive in the limit @xmath93 as well as in a sub interval of @xmath2 depending on the plasma parameters .",
    "thus , the modulated iaw packets are always stable ( unstable ) with long - wavelength ( short - wavelength ) perturbations ( carrier modes ) giving rise the formation of dark envelope solitons ( bright envelope solitons or highly energetic rogons )",
    ". the wave envelope can even be unstable at a medium scale of perturbation with @xmath235 . * as @xmath84 and @xmath83 increase ,",
    "the value of @xmath118 decreases ( hence decreasing the maximum growth rate of instability ) and the range of values of @xmath85 for which @xmath139 ( hence the mi ) increases . the same is true for increasing values of @xmath3 , but decreasing values of @xmath4 except for some region with @xmath93 .",
    "* as the parameters @xmath177 and @xmath3 increase , the values of the critical wave number @xmath149 below which the mi sets in increase , however , the same decreases with increasing values of @xmath178 .",
    "it turns out that the growth rate of instability can be suppressed in superthermal plasmas with higher temperature of hot electrons than the cool electrons , the lower concentration of cold electrons than ions and more ( less ) superthermal cool ( hot ) electrons .",
    "* in the range of values of @xmath85 where @xmath138 , bright envelope solitons are shown to exist both at the small @xmath169 and medium @xmath236 scale of perturbations . however , dark solitons exist only at large scales @xmath237 . *",
    "the mi of iaw envelopes can also lead to the generation of rogue waves in which a significant amount of wave energy is concentrated in relatively a small area in space and time .",
    "typical profiles of the first and second - order rogons are presented with respect to finite space and time .",
    "it is found that at an equilibrium state , while the amplitudes of both the first and second order rogons remain the same , their widths decrease with increasing values of @xmath3 ( i.e. , lack of superthermal cold electrons ) , @xmath83 and the temperature ratio @xmath84 .",
    "however , no significant change of the width is found with a small increase of @xmath178 for both the rogons .    to conclude , the findings of the present investigation should be relevant both in space and astrophysical plasma environments where two - temperature electrons are the main constituents together with ions .",
    "we also propose that an experiment should be done to observe the role of higher order effects for the formation of highly energetic ion - acoustic rogue waves ( super rogue waves ) . + * acknowledgment * + shalini thanks university grants commission , new delhi for awarding rajiv - gandhi fellowship .",
