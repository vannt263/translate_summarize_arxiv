    "the missing flavour - mixed light neutrinos , no lepton or baryon number violation and the absence of any candidate for a dark matter particle , call for a substantial improvement of the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak and strong interactions .",
    "namely , the dominance of the baryon over antibaryon matter in the universe suggests that baryon or lepton number be broken in particle physics @xcite .",
    "it is well known , for example , that the broken lepton number can induce the breaking of the baryon number @xcite .",
    "any alternative to the presence of the cold dark matter in the universe supposes drastic changes not only of the general relativity , but also of the nonrelativistic newtonian theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "however , the direct or indirect detection of the dark matter particle is indispensable .",

    "@xcite ) suggest on the existence of the very heavy dark matter particle when searching for the dark matter annihilation products .",
    "mond ( with its few relativistic generalizations ) represents the alternative to the dark matter paradigm ( see a discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    besides the supersymmetric ,",
    "grand unified or extra dimensional extensions of the sm , a very conservative alternative to the sm was proposed in @xcite , called the by theory , resolving the ultraviolet singularity and the @xmath0 global anomaly problems .",
    "light and heavy majorana neutrinos with flavour mixing and lepton cp violation could play a crucial role as hot and cold dark matter particles in the evolution of the expanding and rotating universe @xcite .",
    "the noncontractible space of the by theory , as an alternative symmetry - breaking mechanism to the higgs one , introduces into the physical realm a new universal lorentz and gauge invariant constant ( uv cutoff in the spacelike domain of the minkowski spacetime , see ref .",

    "the enhanced strong coupling at small distances and the absence of the asymptotic freedom in qcd are the immediate consequences of noncontractible space @xcite .",
    "we show that electroweak quantum loops with heavy t - quark contributing to the cp violating processes of k and b mesons are affected by the uv cutoff @xcite .",
    "the branching fraction for a rare decay @xmath2 is lower by more than @xmath3 in the by theory compared with the sm owing to the modified short distance part of the amplitude @xcite .    atlas and cms experiments at the lhc reported recently @xcite a discovery of the 125 gev resonance",
    ". it could be the higgs boson of some theory beyond the sm , but it could be also some pseudoscalar or scalar meson with a substantial component of the pseudoscalar or scalar toponium @xcite .",
    "even the spin 1 boson can not be excluded as an interpretation of the new 125 gev resonance @xcite .",
    "anyhow , the higgs mechanism does not solve the mass problem of particles .",
    "eventually , the solutions of the coupled system of nonlinear integral dyson - schwinger equations of the uv nonsingular by theory could resolve the mass problem of elementary particles @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the implication of the uv cutoff to the leading qcd contribution for the forward - backward asymmetry in the top - antitop production . the large discrepancy between the theory and the experiment for this asymmetry observable",

    "we present the main ingredients of the calculations while providing more details in the appendix .",
    "results and conclusions are given in the last chapter .",
    "almost invariably , various asymmetry observables of the electroweak or strong interactions are very sensitive to the details of the underlying processes .",
    "it appears that the t - quark pair charge asymmetry can test qcd loop corrections @xcite .",
    "we shall study the dominant quark - antiquark annihilation channel whose structure equals the electron - positron annihilation amplitude modulo coupling and gauge group constant factors @xcite .",

    "@xcite are obtained from the equations in @xcite in the limit of the vanishing mass of incoming fermions .",
    "the qcd in noncontractible space differs from the standard qcd when quantum loops are evaluated with the cutoff in the spacelike domain .",
    "thus , one can find two possible sources of deviation from the standard qcd calculation for the asymmetry function @xmath12 : ( 1 ) calculation of the running coupling @xmath13 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , ( 2 ) box diagram contribution to the virtual correction @xcite :    @xmath14    @xmath15    @xmath16    @xmath17    @xmath18    @xmath19    we mean that @xmath20 is evaluated with @xmath21 coupling , etc .",
    "the calculation of the strong interaction running coupling in noncontractible space was performed in the momentum subtraction renormalization scheme to one loop order in ref .",
    "hard and soft gluon radiations do not contain loop diagrams to leading @xmath10 order .    our main task should be a reevaluation of the interference term in the cross section containing the box diagram in the virtual correction term . to accomplish this in noncontractible space , we have to reduce the amplitude into pieces that are manifestly translationally and lorentz invariant .",
    "we render light quark masses nonvanishing as a regulator of the collinear singularity that is canceled away in the asymmetric cross sections .",
    "infrared singularity is controlled by the regulator gluon mass and is canceled away in both @xmath22 and @xmath23 asymmetry parameters .",
    "the virtual corrections can be represented with the following expression @xcite    @xmath24 , \\\\",

    "now we can compare the t - quark charge asymmetries to the leading one loop order in the standard qcd and the qcd in noncontractible space .",
    "the numerics and discussion can be found in the last chapter .",
    "the difference between the t - quark charge asymmetries of the standard qcd and the qcd in noncontractible space lies in the additional two terms of eq.(2 ) @xmath25 and @xmath23 .",
    "the first additional term @xmath26 can be evaluated using table 1 derived from the formulae for @xmath21 in ref .",
    "this correction can enhance the sm asymmetry by up to @xmath27 for the largest parton @xmath28 .",
    "the strong coupling @xmath29 is frozen at @xmath30 .",
    "one can conclude that the charge asymmetries at the parton level are enhanced in the by theory by more than a factor of 3 ( 5 ) for tevatron ( lhc ) center of mass energies .",
    "it is evident from tables 1 and 2 that the deviation from the sm is larger for higher @xmath32 and the virtual correction ( box diagram ) @xmath23 dominates over the strong coupling correction @xmath25 .",
    "it means that the box diagram explores the deep spacelike domain of the minkowski spacetime to which the asymmetry observable is very sensitive and , in addition , there is no new negative compensation of the real hard and soft contributions ( no quantum loops to this order of perturbation ) except the new @xmath33 factor .        to find charge asymmetry for hadrons",
    ", one has to convolve parton cross sections with parton distributions .",
    "it is necessary to solve dglap and bfkl equations in noncontractible space .",
    "this work remains for the future .",
    "it is very unlikely that higher orders of perturbation in the strong coupling or new parton distributions can remove large deviation of the asymmetry from the standard qcd found at the parton level .",
    "if the lhc confirms the tevatron results , it will be necessary to investigate the issue to higher perturbative order to reach higher accuracy , because to date , it is the largest discrepancy observed between the standard qcd and the experiment .",
