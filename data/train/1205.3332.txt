    "it is generally accepted that studies of hard exclusive scattering processes may allow one to access a three - dimensional picture of the proton in longitudinal and transverse plane  @xcite , which is encoded in generalized parton distributions ( gpds )  @xcite .",
    "one of the principal reactions in this context is compton scattering with one real and one highly - virtual photon ( dvcs ) which has received a lot of attention .",
    "the corresponding measurements are planned , e.g. , at the future 12  gev facility at the jefferson laboratory .",
    "the qcd description of dvcs is based on the operator product expansion ( ope ) of the time - ordered product of two electromagnetic currents where gpds come into play as operator matrix elements . in order to access the transverse proton structure",
    "one is interested in the dependence of the amplitude on the momentum transfer to the target @xmath3 in a sufficiently broad range . since the available photon virtualities @xmath4 are not very large , corrections of the type @xmath1 which are formally twist - four effects , can have significant impact on the data analysis and should be taken into account .",
    "in addition , target mass corrections of the type @xmath2 can be significant at least in certain kinematic regions and have to be included as well .",
    "such effects are usually referred to as kinematic power corrections since they can be expressed in terms of leading - twist parton distributions and do not involve `` genuine '' nonperturbative effects due to quark - gluon correlations .",
    "a well known example is provided by nachtmann corrections  @xcite to the structure functions in deep - inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering ( dis ) . on a technical level , these corrections arise because of the subtractions that are needed to form traceless operators .",
    "the nachtmann power corrections have been studied in full detail ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and are routinely taken into account in the analysis of dis data .",
    "another classical result is due to wandzura and wilczek  @xcite who have shown that the twist - three structure function @xmath5 for massive targets with spin  1/2 receives a contribution related to the leading - twist structure function @xmath6 .",
    "the wandzura - wilczek relation is a consequence of lorentz invariance and can be understood as spin rotation in the target rest frame  @xcite .",
    "the importance of taking into account kinematic power corrections to dvcs was acknowledged by many authors  @xcite .",
    "this task is much more complicated , however , because in addition to nachtmann - type contributions related to subtraction of traces in the leading - twist operators one must take into account contributions of twist - four operators that are related to the leading - twist ones by total derivatives .",
    "we call these operators descendants of the leading twist ones , because their matrix elements do not involve any new nonperturbative parameters .",
    "schematically @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the usual leading - twist operators .",
    "the problem arises because matrix elements of the operator @xmath9 on free quarks vanish  @xcite .",
    "thus in order to find its _ leading - order _ coefficient function in the ope of e.g. two electromagnetic currents one is forced to consider either more complicated ( quark - antiquark - gluon ) matrix elements , or stay with the quark - antiquark ones but go over to the next - to - leading order . in both cases",
    "the real difficulty is not the calculation of the relevant feynman diagrams , but the necessity to separate the contribution of interest from the contributions of `` genuine '' twist - four operators the number of which increases with the spin .",
    "this problem was solved in refs .",
    "@xcite using hermiticity of the evolution equations for the so - called non - quasipartonic twist - four operators with respect to a certain conformal scalar product  @xcite .",
    "hermiticity implies that the coefficient functions of multiplicatively renormalizable twist - four operators are mutually orthogonal with a proper weight function . since `` kinematic '' twist - four operators are multiplicatively renormalizable by construction , using this property allows one to separate the kinematic part from an arbitrary twist - four operator in qcd  @xcite and calculate the coefficient functions for all descendants of the leading twist operators to the product of two electromagnetic currents to the required twist - four accuracy  @xcite .",
    "the results of  refs.@xcite amount to a complete calculation of kinematic power corrections to twist - four accuracy in two - photon processes at the level of the operator product expansion ( to the leading order in the strong coupling ) .",
    "a question remains , however , whether the ope is applicable to the study of exclusive reactions with one real photon , e.g. dvcs .",
    "in other language , the question is whether kinematic corrections @xmath10 to dvcs can be taken into account consistently in the framework of collinear factorization .",
    "the answer is not obvious and , in fact , there are many arguments suggesting that collinear factorization does not hold in dvcs beyond the leading twist .",
    "the hope is that the collinear factorization framework may nevertheless be valid for a _ subset _ of `` kinematic '' power corrections defined as the contributions of the descendants of the leading - twist operators to the ope , because such terms are intertwined with the factorizable leading - twist contributions by the electromagnetic gauge and , more importantly , translation invariance . in this work",
    "we verify this conjecture by explicit calculation on the simplest example of a ( pseudo)scalar target .",
    "to this end we derive explicit expressions for the helicity amplitudes to twist - four accuracy including all",
    "finite@xmath0 and target - mass corrections , which turn out to be remarkably simple .",
    "an inspection shows that these amplitudes do not contain stronger singularities than those present already in the leading - twist amplitudes and , hence , collinear factorization is not endangered ( at least to the accuracy of our calculation , i.e. in the leading order in the strong coupling ) .",
    "this result is very encouraging since taking into account @xmath1 and @xmath2 power corrections removes one important source of uncertainties in the theory predictions for intermediate momentum transfers , @xmath11  gev@xmath12 , which is the most interesting range in view of the planned experiments .",
    "the presentation is organized as follows .",
    "2 is introductory .",
    "here we define the kinematic variables , explain our notation and quote the necessary portion of the results of refs .  @xcite that are employed in the further analysis . in appendix",
    "a we explain why the results of  @xcite that have been derived for flavor - nonsinglet operators are valid for flavor - singlet contributions as well , without any modification .",
    "the calculation of helicity amplitudes for the dvcs on a scalar ( or , equivalently , pseudoscalar ) target is presented in sect .",
    "3 . in this derivation",
    "we pay special attention to the restoration of translation invariance in the sum of all twists , leaving some details to appendix b. the final expressions are collected in sect .",
    "4 . in sect .  5 we present some model estimates of the magnitude of kinematic power corrections and summarize",
    "for definiteness we will consider dvcs on a pion target .",
    "the hadronic part of the amplitude is determined by the matrix element of the time - ordered product of two electromagnetic currents @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the quark field and @xmath15 is the diagonal matrix of quark charges @xmath16 , @xmath17 . in the most general form @xmath18 here",
    "@xmath19 are isospin indices , @xmath20 are the momenta of the initial and final state pion , and @xmath21 are the virtual and real photon momenta , respectively : @xmath22    making use of translation invariance one can get rid of one integration and define the dvcs amplitude @xmath23 by a simpler expression @xmath24 where @xmath25 are real numbers subject to the constraint @xmath26 and we use a notation @xmath27 since @xmath28 does not depend on @xmath25 one can fix their values in some way ( e.g. set @xmath29 or @xmath30 ) from the very beginning .",
    "it is instructive , however , to keep these parameters arbitrary throughout the calculation for the following reason . in order to calculate @xmath28 including terms @xmath10 we have to employ the ope for the product of currents @xmath31 to the twist - four accuracy @xmath32 the fact that @xmath28 does not depend on @xmath33 ( translation invariance ) is a consequence of the transformation property of the @xmath34-product : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the usual momentum operator @xmath37    = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu}\\phi(x)\\ , .",

    "\\label{eq : shift2}\\ ] ] here and below @xmath39 $ ] stands for a commutator .",
    "the crucial point is that these relations do not hold for each term in the twist expansion ( [ ttwist ] ) separately , but only in the sum of all twists .",
    "this implies that the expression for the dvcs amplitude obtained from the contribution of the twist - two operators alone is not translation invariant to the @xmath40 accuracy , i.e. it depends on the choice of the positions of the currents .",
    "translation invariance is restored in the sum with contributions of higher - twist operators that are related to the leading twist by adding total derivatives .",
    "these operators were constructed explicitly in refs .",
    "@xcite for twist - three and in refs .",
    "@xcite for twist - four .",
    "this means , first , that estimates of kinematic corrections based on the nachtmann - type contributions of leading - twist operators alone do not have any physical significance and can be misleading .",
    "second , translation invariance ( independence on @xmath25 ) of the final answer ( in the sum of all twists ) provides an important check of the calculations .    a similar observation which is thoroughly discussed in the literature ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , concerns the electromagnetic gauge invariance of the amplitude @xmath41 , which implies the ward identities @xmath42 or , in the operator form @xmath43\\ , , \\nonumber\\\\      \\partial^\\nu   t_{\\mu\\nu}(z_1,z_2 ) & = & z_1\\big [ i\\mathbf{p}^\\nu , t_{\\mu\\nu}(z_1,z_2)\\big]\\ , , \\label{ward}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 . similar to the above , the ward identities only hold for the sum of all twists in the ope but are violated for each twist separately .",
    "it was checked in ref .",
    "@xcite that eqs .",
    "( [ ward ] ) are indeed satisfied in the sum of twist - two , twist - three and twist - four terms to the required accuracy on the operator level , which guarantees that eq .",
    "( [ qqa ] ) is automatically valid for scattering amplitudes from arbitrary targets .",
    "this constraint is eventually built up in the construction of gauge - invariant , e.g. helicity , amplitudes ( see below ) , whereas the translation invariance condition applies to each helicity amplitude separately .",
    "we use the two photon momenta , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , to define a longitudinal plane spanned by two light - like vectors @xmath47 where @xmath48 for this choice the momentum transfer to the target @xmath49 is purely longitudinal , which is convenient for calculation , and the target ( pion ) momenta have a nonzero transverse component : @xmath50 the skewedness parameter @xmath51 is defined as @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "the scalar product of the two light - like vectors @xmath54 in our normalization is of the order of @xmath4 , @xmath55 whereas @xmath56 and the condition @xmath57 translates to the lower bound @xmath58 , cf .",

    "we accept the following rule for raising and lowering of spinor indices @xmath66 where the antisymmetric levi - civita tensor @xmath67 is defined as follows @xmath68 for this definition @xmath69 and @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "an invariant product of weyl spinors is defined as : @xmath72 more details and some useful identities can be found in  @xcite .",
    "an arbitrary like - like four - vector in the spinor representation , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , can be parameterized by a weyl spinor such that @xmath75 , where @xmath76 .",
    "in particular we introduce two auxiliary spinors , @xmath77 and @xmath78 associated with the light - like vectors @xmath79 and @xmath80 defined above : @xmath81 for example one can choose @xmath82 the scalar product @xmath83 can be written in the form @xmath84 one of the advantages of this formalism is that two auxiliary spinors are sufficient to define a basis in the whole four - dimensional space .",
    "indeed , the basis vectors in the transverse plane ( orthogonal to @xmath54 ) can be chosen as @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "an arbitrary four - vector can be expanded in this basis as @xmath87 where @xmath88 so that @xmath89 and @xmath90 correspond to the `` plus '' and `` minus '' coordinates in the usual sense , respectively , whereas @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the two ( holomorphic and anti - holomorphic ) complex coordinates in the transverse plane .",
    "using the spinor formalism it becomes straightforward to write down a general parametrization for the dvcs amplitude @xmath93 that takes into account the ward identities  ( [ qqa ] ) .",
    "the constraint @xmath94 becomes @xmath95 , and its general solution is @xmath96 the first two terms in this expression correspond to the contributions of a transversely polarized real photon in the final state , and the last term to a ( unphysical ) longitudinally polarized photon . making use of the second relation in eq .",

    "<S> using the formalism developed in @xcite we carry out the first complete calculation of kinematic power corrections to the helicity amplitudes of deeply - virtual compton scattering to the twist - four accuracy for a study case of a ( pseudo)scalar target . </S>",
    "<S> our main result is that both finite@xmath0 , @xmath1 , and target mass , @xmath2 , twist - four kinematic power corrections turn out to be factorizable , at least to the leading order in the strong coupling . the structure of these corrections is discussed and a short model study of their numerical impact is presented </S>"
