    "<S> this system consists of a cooper - pair box coupled to a nano - mechanical resonator , in which the latter is continuously monitored by a single - electron transistor or quantum point - contact . </S>",
    "<S> further , we show that these kinds of jumps , and the jumps that emerge in a continuous quantum non - demolition measurement are one and the same phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider manipulating the jumps by applying feedback control to the cooper - pair box .    in 1998 </S>",
    "<S> mabuchi and wiseman discovered the existence of emergent jumps in purely diffusive , measured cavity qed system , and the termed the phenomena `` retroactive '' quantum jumps  @xcite . since that time it has also been discovered that quantum jumps will emerge in a noisy system subjected to a continuous quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement . </S>",
    "<S> examples are the continuous measurement of the energy of a two - level system , such as a cooper - pair box ( cpb )  @xcite , and the measurement of the energy of a nano - mechanical resonator  @xcite . our main purpose here is to show that the jumps discovered by mabuchi and wiseman , and the jumps in a qnd measurement are , in fact , the same phenomena having the same underlying origin . while there was no explicit qnd measurement in the cavity qed scenario of mabuchi and wiseman , the `` retroactive '' jumps are nevertheless due to a qnd measurement that arises as a result of the interaction between two subsystems . </S>",
    "<S> this is a qnd measurement on one subsystem mediated through the other subsystem . </S>",
    "<S> these jumps may therefore be described as arising from an _ indirect _ qnd measurement , rather than a direct one . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if one interprets the cqed jumps of mabuchi and wiseman as retroactive , then the jumps induced by all qnd measurements , whether on quantum or classical systems , are retroactive in the same sense .    in the process of our analysis </S>",
    "<S> will also do a number of other things . </S>",
    "<S> we first show how to design a nano - electro - mechanical system so that jumps of the `` retroactive '' type emerge in the diffusive motion . </S>",
    "<S> this system consists of a nano - mechical resonator linearly coupled to a cpb  @xcite , where the position of the resonator is continuously measured . </S>",
    "<S> this measurement can be implemented using a single - electron transistor ( set )  @xcite or a quantum point contact ( qpc )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of this system are not identical to the cavity - qed system analyzed in  @xcite , and this difference makes it easier to see the connection with the usual direct qnd measurement . we also show that it is possible to effect a degree of control over the jumps by applying feedback control to the cpb .    </S>",
    "<S> if one places a cpb adjacent to a nano - resonator , and places a voltage on the nano resonator , then the resonator feels a linear force from the cpb , and this depends upon which state the cpb is in . </S>",
    "<S> ( that is , whether or not the cpb contains an excess cooper - pair ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian describing the dynamics of the coupled systems is  @xcite @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> \\label{ham}\\ ] ] here @xmath1 is the annihilation operator for the resonator , which has angular frequency @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency corresponding to the charging energy of the cpb is @xmath3 , and the josephson tunneling frequency is @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling term allows us to perform @xmath5 rotations using voltage pulses , but otherwise can be ignored since we set @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between the resonator and the cpb is the linear force that the resonator feels from the charge on the cbp , and the strength of this force determines @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the expression for the above rate parameters in terms of the physical configuration of the resonator and cpb may be found , for example , in  @xcite .    as indicated above , the position of the resonator can be monitored continuously using an set or qpc . </S>",
    "<S> we model this measurement process as an inefficient , but otherwise ideal , continuous position measurement  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the continuous stream of measurement results ( often referred to as the measurement record ) is @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is an increment of gaussian white noise  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 is a measure of the rate at which information is extracted from the system , and which we will refer to as the measurement strength . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath12 is called the efficiency of the measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction of the system with its environment ( including the set ) continually carries information away from the system ( at a rate proportional to @xmath11 ) , and @xmath12 gives the fraction of this information which is actually collected by the observer . the resulting dynamics of the system density matrix , @xmath13 , is given by the stochastic master equation ( sme )  @xcite @xmath14 dt - k [ x,[x,\\rho ] ] dt \\nonumber    + \\sqrt{2 \\eta k } ( x \\rho + \\rho x - 2\\langle x\\rangle \\rho ) dw     \\label{msme}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is given by eq.([ham ] ) above and @xmath16 is the position operator for the resonator . </S>",
    "<S> as such , @xmath11 has units of @xmath17 , and so we define the corresponding dimensionless rate @xmath18 .    </S>",
    "<S> we will consider two modifications of the above basic dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the first is that we will modulate the interaction strength @xmath7 between the resonator and the cpb at the resonant frequency of the resonator , so that @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be done by varying the voltage on the resonator . </S>",
    "<S> the result is to allow the cpb to drive the resonator at its resonant frequency , generating the maximum steady - state displacement of the resonator . </S>",
    "<S> the second modification is the application of a real - time feedback loop  @xcite to damp the motion of the resonator . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the observer continually applies a force @xmath20 to the resonator , where @xmath21 $ ] is the observers maximum likelihood estimate of the momentum of the oscillator at each time @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the result of this is to apply a ( somewhat noisy ) frictional damping force to the resonator .    </S>",
    "<S> we must also include in the dynamics the effects of temperature on the resonator . </S>",
    "<S> the resonator is in contact with a thermal bath that induces damping and injects noise into the resonator . </S>",
    "<S> since the quality factor of the resonator is above @xmath23 , the thermal damping is much smaller than the damping that will be induced via the feedback loop , and as a result we simply subsume this damping into the feedback . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal noise can be taken into account by choosing an appropriate value for the efficiency @xmath12  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the noise introduced by the ( low temperature ) thermal bath is just as if a position detector was carrying information away at the rate @xmath24  @xcite , where @xmath25 is the thermal damping rate and @xmath26 is the temperature . to include the thermal noise one therefore replaces @xmath11 in eq.([msme ] ) with @xmath27 , and @xmath12 with @xmath28 where @xmath12 is the set measurement efficiency .    </S>",
    "<S> the final thing to include is the environmental noise on the cpb . </S>",
    "<S> the kind of noise that is of interest to us is noise which causes diffusion between the two energy eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> it is this noise which , coupled with the system s dynamics , induces the quantum jumps . </S>",
    "<S> thermal noise is of this type , and is usually modeled with the master equation @xmath29 + \\xi { \\cal d}[\\sigma_+ ] \\ } \\rho $ ] , where @xmath30 , and @xmath31\\rho \\equiv [ a^\\dagger a,\\rho]_+ - 2 a \\rho a^\\dagger$ ] for any operator @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the charging energy of a cpb is usually chosen so that @xmath32 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the thermal noise will only cause the upper state to decay , rather than generate diffusion between the two .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless there are other ways to induce the desired diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> one is to apply a stochastic sequence of pulses to a voltage gate , where the pulses bring the cpb to the degeneracy point . </S>",
    "<S> if the random pulse lengths are short compared to @xmath33 , then the josephson tunnelling term generates an evolution described by a hamiltonian @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is white noise with autocorrelation @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the result is the master equation @xmath37 \\rho$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> this master equation closely emulates the thermal master equation in the limit in which @xmath38  , the thermal noise term becomes @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> since the system hamiltonian is approximately symmetric in @xmath16 and @xmath40 , the effect on the system is equivalent to @xmath41 . ] . </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , one could instead increase the josephson term . </S>",
    "<S> due to the measurement dynamics to be discussed later , this should have the same effect as thermal noise .    in our numerical simulations we choose to explicitly model the second noise source discussed above , that of stochastic driving proportional to @xmath5 as a result , the full dynamics of the resonator - cpb system is @xmath42 dt -k_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize tot } } [ x,[x,\\rho ] ] dt \\nonumber    \\nonumber \\\\             & + & \\kappa { \\cal d}[\\sigma_x ] \\rho dt   + \\sqrt{2 \\eta_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize tot } } k_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize tot } } } ( x \\rho + \\rho x - 2\\langle x\\rangle \\rho ) dw \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] following the analysis of the cavity - qed system by mabuchi and wiseman </S>",
    "<S> , we now examine the steady - state of the hamiltonian @xmath43 including the feedback damping , when the cpb is in either of it s energy eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> we will denote these eigenstates by @xmath44  they correspond to the presence or absence of a cooper - pair in the box . </S>",
    "<S> in these two cases the resonator has the effective hamiltonian @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the maximum value of the driving force . since the hamiltonian is linear , </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the expectation values of @xmath16 and @xmath47 are simply those for the equivalent classical system , namely that of a driven , damped harmonic oscillator . as a result , the steady - state solution for @xmath48 is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the mass of the resonator . </S>",
    "<S> the state of the resonator in each case is a ( somewhat squeezed ) gaussian state . </S>",
    "<S> thus , like the cavity - qed system in  @xcite , our system has two stable orthogonal states , each of which is a product of a distinct state of the two - level system with a distinct gaussian state of the resonator . in our case </S>",
    "<S> it is the steady - state phase of the resonator , @xmath51 , that is tightly correlated with the orthogonal states of the cpb .    the measurement of the position of the oscillator continually provides the observer with information regarding the location of the oscillator in phase space , and thus about the phase of the oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> since this phase is correlated with the eigenstates of the oscillator , the measurement will tend to continually collapse the state of the cpb to one of its eigenstates . because of this it is only the two eigenstates that are stable against the measurement process , and this is the reason that the two steady - states given by eq.([ssx ] ) are important </S>",
    "<S>  if the environmental noise is to induce jumps in the system it will be between these two stable states .    </S>",
    "<S> we now simulate the full dynamics of the observed nano - electro - mechanical system , including the environmental noise . in specifying values for the system parameters </S>",
    "<S> , we will quote all rate constants in terms of the frequency of the resonator @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> we set the interaction strength @xmath53 and the feedback damping rate @xmath54 , both of which are easily achievable  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we set the set measurement strength at @xmath55 , which is also not difficult to achieve , certainly with @xmath56 as high as @xmath57  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find from our simulations that relatively high efficiency ( @xmath58 ) is required for the observer to effectively track the quantum jumps . </S>",
    "<S> this requires that the set have high efficiency , and that @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> the question is still open as to whether such an efficiency can be reached with an set  @xcite , but it is estimated that a qpc should in theory be able to achieve efficiencies above @xmath60  . setting @xmath61 , and using the parameters in  @xcite , gives @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> thus a factor of 20 increase in @xmath11 from that configuration would be required . while we would expect this to be possible , </S>",
    "<S> the overall efficiency requirement is the most challenging in the scenario . finally , we choose the cpb noise strength to be @xmath63 .    in figure  [ fig1](a ) </S>",
    "<S> we show the evolution of the phase of the resonator , @xmath64 , which we define by the relation @xmath65 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath66 is as defined above , and @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> we start the resonator in a coherent state with @xmath68 and @xmath69 , so that the initial phase is zero . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the phase quickly drifts to one of the two values @xmath70 , and from then on exhibits jumps in the motion between these values . in figure  [ fig1](b ) </S>",
    "<S> we show the position of the resonator as a function of time . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the position oscillations tends to reduce during phase flips , as expected .    , and </S>",
    "<S> for ( c ) @xmath71.,width=321 ]    one of the most interesting aspects of these quantum jumps is that they are an emergent phenomenon ; the underlying dynamics does not contain jumps but consists purely of continuous diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> the authors of  @xcite explain this emergence by providing a detailed analysis of the interplay of the correlations produced by the hamiltonian dynamics , the measurement induced localization , and the diffusive noise . their analysis is certainly not wrong . </S>",
    "<S> our point here is that the mechanism that produces jumps in this case is the same mechanism that produces jumps in the case of a continuous qnd measurement . </S>",
    "<S> this provides us with a somewhat simpler picture of the cause of the `` retroactive '' jumps .    </S>",
    "<S> qnd measurements are measurements in which the observable being measured is not changed by the dynamics of the system ( that is , the observable commutes with the hamiltonian )  @xcite . as a result , once the measurement has projected the system onto a given eigenstate of the observable , it remains there throughout the remainder of the observation period . </S>",
    "<S> now consider what happens when the observable is additionally subject to diffusion from environmental noise . in the absence of the measurement </S>",
    "<S> the noise will cause the observable to diffuse from one eigenstate to another , but in the presence of a sufficiently strong continuous qnd measurement the dynamics is quite different . consider what happens during a small time interval when the system begins in one eigenstate . during the interval </S>",
    "<S> the diffusion will generate a small probability that the system is in an adjacent eigenstate . </S>",
    "<S> however , during the same interval the measurement will collapse the system to one of the eigenstates , and with very high probability this will be the initial eigenstate , since the diffusion has only managed to generate a small probability for the other eigenstates during the short time interval . as a result , it is only unlikely events , in which the noise has a particularly large fluctuation , and the measurement conspires by returning a low probability result , that will cause the system to transition from one eigenstate to the next . </S>",
    "<S> the result is periods in which the system remains in a given eigenstate of the qnd observable , interspersed by quantum jumps between the eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> the jumps are _ quantum _ jumps since they only appear because the observable has a discrete spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this qualitative picture has been confirmed by numerical simulations of a measurement of the energy of a quantum harmonic oscillator  @xcite , and the states of an electron in a coupled pair of quantum dots ( often referred to as a `` charge qubit '' )  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the jumps discovered in  @xcite , and those in the dynamics here , can now be seen to be caused by the same effect , except in that in these two cases the qnd measurement is mediated through a second system . in our case </S>",
    "<S> the qnd observable is the energy of the cpb . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between the resonator and the cpb causes the phase of the resonator to be tightly correlated with the energy eigenstates of the cpb , as shown in eq.([ssx ] ) . in continually providing information about the phase of the resonator </S>",
    "<S> , the position measurement necessarily provides information about the energy of the cpb , generating a qnd measurement , and resulting in quantum jumps . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly it is not necessary to perform a qnd measurement on the mediating system ( the resonator ) to generate the jumps ; position is not a qnd observable for the resonator .    </S>",
    "<S> we now consider the use of feedback control to stabilize the system against the jumps . in doing so we reveal a fundamental limitation of feedback control in this context - hamiltonian feedback can not stop the system from jumping . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this is quite simple  as discussed above , the jumps from @xmath72 to @xmath73 , for example , are due to the small probability for @xmath73 continually generated by the noise process . to generate this probability </S>",
    "<S> the noise process merely reduces the length of the bloch vector . since the cause of the jumps is purely this reduction ( along with the qnd measurement ) , and </S>",
    "<S> since hamiltonian evolution , feedback or otherwise , can rotate the bloch vector but can not change its length , feedback is powerless to prevent the jumping . however , feedback can be used to _ increase _ the rate of jumps from either state , thereby altering the relative time that the system spends in the two states . </S>",
    "<S> ultimately this could be used to ensure that the system spends almost all its time in one of the states , creating an effective stability .    </S>",
    "<S> we implement this procedure by applying a feedback hamiltonian of the form @xmath74 to the cpb , where @xmath75 , so that @xmath76 determines the feedback strength . in each time step @xmath77 </S>",
    "<S> , we choose this hamiltonian so as to rotate the system towards the state @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> we set @xmath78 , and find that @xmath71 is required to obtain a significant effect . </S>",
    "<S> we plot the resulting evolution in fig  [ fig1](c ) , for the same noise realization as before . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the phase is now more stable at @xmath79 than @xmath80 . </S>"
