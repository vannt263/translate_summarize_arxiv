    "spectrophotometric studies of extremely metal - deficient ( @xmath8 ) blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies give important insights into the properties of massive stars and the physical conditions in low - metallicity environments .",
    "for example , recent spectroscopic studies of the most metal - deficient bcd known so far , i zw 18 , unveiled a wolf - rayet ( wr ) stellar population ( izotov et al .",
    "1997a , legrand et al .",
    "1997 ) , which allows to put important constraints on evolutionary models for massive stars with a very low heavy element abundance .",
    "the analysis of such rare systems in the local universe can also be of great benefit to studies of very high - redshift galaxies some of which may still be in their formation stages .",
    "further , the low metallicity and high excitation h ii regions found in extremely metal - deficient bcds allow to derive with high precision the primordial @xmath9he abundance and hence one of the important cosmological parameters  the baryon mass fraction of the universe ( e.g. izotov et al .",
    "1994 , 1997c , 1999 ) .",
    "some recent observational studies indicate that galaxy formation is not a process occurring only at an early cosmological epoch but still happening at present , though at a very low level ( thuan et al .",
    "1997 , papaderos et al .",
    "1998 , izotov & thuan 1999 , kniazev et al .",
    "izotov & thuan ( 1999 ) have proposed that a metallicity @xmath101/20 @xmath11 might be a useful indicator for identifying active dwarf galaxies in an unevolved stage .",
    "if so , the spectrophotometric analysis of such nearby young galaxy candidates with age @xmath310@xmath12 yr , in particular dwarf systems undergoing one of their first starbursts , is evidently of major importance to observational cosmology . on the other hand ,",
    "some authors reach the conclusion that none of the very metal - deficient bcds at low redshift are young galaxies ( e.g. , kunth & stlin 2000 , legrand 2000 , legrand et al .",
    "the low - metallicity condition is fulfilled only in a tiny fraction ( @xmath13 0.1 % ) of bcds known to be gas - rich systems undergoing recurrent bursts of star - formation . while debates concerning the age of extremely metal - deficient bcds continue it seems helpful to proceed with detailed studies of all these galaxies identified so far in the local universe .",
    "we focus here on one of these rare candidates , the bcd tol 1214277 , the very low metallicity of which has been established by earlier spectroscopic work ( campbell et al . 1986 ; pagel et al .",
    "1992 ; masegosa , moles & campos - aguilar 1994 ) .",
    "thuan & izotov ( 1997 ) have derived the distance to  of @xmath14 = 103.9 mpc adopting the observed radial velocity @xmath15 = 7795 km s@xmath16 and assuming the hubble constant @xmath17 = 75 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 .",
    "the presence of very massive stars in this bcd is indicated by strong nebular lines ( pagel et al .",
    "1992 ) and a uv stellar nv @xmath41240 line with a pcygni profile ( thuan & izotov 1997 ) .",
    "the latter properties along with the fact that  is the lowest metallicity bcd with detected ly@xmath18 emission ( thuan & izotov 1997 ) make it not only a probable young bcd candidate but also allow the study of the ly@xmath18 radiation escaping from the starburst .",

    "however , little is known on the structural properties and colors of that diffuse stellar host underlying the starburst component",

    ", we show with the dotted box the position of the underlying dwarf galaxy if a reddening @xmath121(@xmath122 ) = 0.2 mag is adopted . larger values for @xmath121(@xmath122 ) are unlikely because in this case the location of the underlying component in the ( @xmath82 ) vs. ( @xmath81 ) color diagram can not be reproduced by any of the models .",
    "note that a correction for any residual contribution of gaseous emission along the major axis of the bcd will shift the observed ( @xmath81 ) index bluewards .",
    "thus we expect the colors of tol 1214277 s underlying component to lie between the solid and dotted boxes in the ( @xmath82 ) vs. ( @xmath81 ) diagram ( fig .",

    "( 1994 ) for a metallicity @xmath11/20 . a salpeter initial mass function with slope 2.35 and with lower and upper mass limits of 0.6 @xmath124 and 100 @xmath124 has been adopted .",
    "it may be seen from fig .",
    "[ f10 ] that the observed colors of the lsb host can not be accounted for by the model with two instantaneous bursts , one of which is young and the other old .",
    "the observations can , however , be reproduced equally well by an instantaneously formed stellar population with an age log ( @xmath123/yr ) @xmath3 8.1 and a stellar population forming continuously between log ( @xmath123/yr ) @xmath3 8.7 and log ( @xmath123/yr ) @xmath125 7.3 .",

    "overlayed with the observed spectrum we show model seds for three instantaneous burst populations with ages 10 myr , 100 myr and 1 gyr , computed with the models described above .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ f11 ] that the observed sed of the underlying lsb host of  is matched best with a single burst population with an age 100 myr .    in summary",
    ", models with simple star formation histories of  give an age between 0.1 and 0.5 gyr for its stellar underlying host .",
    "given that there is no compelling evidence for an appreciable stellar population with cosmological age , we consider 1 gyr to be a reasonable upper age limit for the bcd .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the age estimates based on the color predictions from geneva evolutionary tracks ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) .    therefore ,  is a second example besides sbs 1415 + 437 ( thuan et al . 1999 ) of an extremely metal - deficient bcd showing cometary morphology and evidence for being relatively unevolved .",
    "this result supports the conjecture by noeske et al .",
    "( 2000 ) that cometary bcds may be systematically younger than bcds having a smooth elliptical or circular stellar lsb envelope ( ie / ne bcds ) .",
    "low metallicity may be another necessary condition for young age ( izotov & thuan 1999 ) .",
    "the main conclusions drawn from our imaging and spectroscopic analysis of deep vlt data of the extremely metal - deficient ( @xmath0@xmath1@xmath0@xmath2/25 ) and nearby ( @xmath14 = 103.9 mpc ) bcd  may be summarized as follows :    \\1 .",
    "undergoes a vigorous burst of star formation having ignited less than 4 myr ago .",
    "the starburst takes place within a bright ( @xmath126 mag ) compact ( @xmath3 500 pc in diameter ) region , giving rise to extended and abundant ionized gas emission with an h@xmath53 equivalent width of @xmath1 320  .",
    "the starburst is powered by several thousands of o7v stars and 170 late - type nitrogen wolf  rayet stars .",
    "\\2 . in this very metal - deficient bcd",
    "we discover for the first time the high ionization line [ fe v ] @xmath44227 .",
    "moreover , we detect extraordinarily strong he ii @xmath44686 emission with an intensity as high as 5% of that of the h@xmath53 emission line . this implies the presence of a very hard radiation field in .",
    "the intensity ratio @xmath95([fe v ] @xmath44227 ) / @xmath95(he ii @xmath44686 ) in  compares well with that in another extremely metal - poor bcd with [ fe v ] @xmath44227 emission , sbs 0335052 , being in both cases larger by more than one order of magnitude than the ratio observed in high - excitation planetary nebulae . while the relative number of wr stars of @xmath98(wr ) / @xmath98(o + wr ) = 0.023 in  is compatible with theoretical predictions , the intensity of the he ii @xmath44686 emission line exceeds several times the predictions of standard h ii photoionization models , even when the hard radiation component of wolf - rayet stars is taken into account .",
    "therefore , we argue that the hard ionizing radiation field in is produced from the combined effect of massive stars and sn - driven shocks .",
    "star - forming activity in  is confined to the northeastern tip of a cometary dwarf galaxy with an absolute @xmath5 magnitude @xmath26 16 mag and an isophotal size of 7.6@xmath244.8 kpc at 28 @xmath5 mag/@xmath6 .",
    "an exponential fitting law provides a reasonable approximation to the intensity distribution of the stellar lsb host in its outskirts , for @xmath127 mag/@xmath6 .",
    "it fails , however , to properly describe the observed brightness distribution at intermediate and high intensity levels .",
    "these are better fitted by an exponential distribution which flattens at small radii , similar to the v - type profiles described by binggeli & cameron ( 1991 ) .",
    "the radially averaged ( @xmath82 ) and ( @xmath81 ) colors of the lsb host of  are consistent with those for either an instantaneous burst with log ( @xmath123/yr ) @xmath3 8.1 , or a continuous star formation between log ( @xmath123/yr ) @xmath3 8.7 and log ( @xmath123/yr ) @xmath125 7.3 .",
