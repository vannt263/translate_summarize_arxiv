    "the standard model has been extensively tested and it is a very successful description of the weak interaction phenomenology .",
    "nevertheless , the electroweak symmetry breaking sector has essentially remained unexplored . in the standard model ,",
    "the higgs boson plays a crucial rle in the symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "however , the presence of such a fundamental scalar at the 100 gev scale gives rise to some theoretical problems , such as the naturalness of a light higgs boson and the triviality of the fundamental higgs self - interaction .",
    "these problems lead to the conclusion that the higgs sector of the standard model is in fact a low energy effective description of some new physics at a higher energy scale .",
    "three main avenues for the new physics have been proposed : low - scale supersymmetry@xcite , large extra dimensions at tev scale@xcite and dynamical symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "a common prediction of all these extensions of the standard model is the appearance of new particles in the range of some hundred gev to a few tev .",
    "we focus on the issue of the technicolor models of dynamical symmetry breaking which predict new particles such as pseudo - nambu - goldstone - bosons ( pngb ) and vector resonances .",
    "many of these models include colored technifermions and hence some pngb s can be color - triplet or even color - octet particles .",
    "these color - octet scalars can be copiously produced at a hadron collider and they are the subject of this paper .",
    "the main contribution to the color - octet pngb masses comes from qcd .",
    "if it is assumed that technicolor dynamics scales from qcd , this contribution is in the range of @xmath2  gev , but their masses can be different in models with non - qcd - like dynamics@xcite .",
    "production of technicolor particles has been studied at various present and future colliders such as tevatron@xcite , lep@xcite , nlc@xcite and the muon collider@xcite .",
    "the impact of pngb on rare k meson decays induced through the exchange of color - singlet @xmath3 and color - octet @xmath4 technipions has been recently studied@xcite in the context of multiscale technicolor@xcite where typical limits of the order of @xmath5  gev were obtained .    of special interest",
    "is the case of the isoscalar color - octet pngb , the so  called technieta ( @xmath0 ) , since it can be produced via gluon fusion through the heavy quark loop . in the near future , the upgraded @xmath6",
    "tev tevatron collider will be the most promising machine for technieta search .",
    "the channel @xmath7 was initially studied by appelquist and triantaphyllou  @xcite in the context of the one family technicolor model@xcite .",
    "more recently eichten and lane@xcite have studied the same channel in the context of walking technicolor .",
    "they concluded that a technieta with mass in the range @xmath8  gev doubles the top quark production cross section at tevatron and hence it is excluded in this mass range .    in our study",
    "we would like to concentrate on the search of technieta with mass below the @xmath9 threshold , which is not constrained by the @xmath9 production process .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath11 processes were studied in the early eighties by hayot and napoly  @xcite in the framework of the one family technicolor model .",
    "they showed that , due to the signal - to - background ratio , the gluon - photon channel is preferable .",
    "nevertheless , theirs results must be taken only as qualitative since no complete and detailed analysis were made .    in this letter",
    "we perform a complete realistic study of the @xmath12 process in order to understand tevatron potentials for @xmath0 search with the mass below the @xmath9 threshold .",
    "we consider three different scenarios : the one family model  @xcite , top - color assisted technicolor  ( tc2 )  @xcite and multiscale technicolor  @xcite .",
    "the color - octet technieta couples to gluons and photons through the adler - bell - jackiw anomaly@xcite .",
    "this effective coupling can be written as :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 represents the polarization and momentum of the vector boson @xmath16 . in our case",
    "the factors @xmath17 are given by@xcite :    @xmath18    and    @xmath19    where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the electromagnetic and strong coupling constant , and @xmath24 is the number of technicolors ( we take @xmath25 )    the technieta coupling to quarks can be written as :    @xmath26    with these couplings we can compute the technieta partial widths :    @xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29    where    @xmath30    @xmath31 is the quark mass and @xmath32 is the technieta mass .",
    "these expressions were used to calculate the technieta total width . from equations ( [ eq : gamma_eta_gg ] ) and ( [ eq : gamma_eta_gfoton ] ) we can see that :    @xmath33    hence , the decay channel @xmath34 is suppressed , but due to the more manageable background it is expected to provide a larger statistical significance .    the constant @xmath35 that appears in the couplings is the pngb decay constant .",
    "its value is model - dependent . in this work",
    "we consider three values for @xmath35 : @xmath36  gev for the one family technicolor model , @xmath37  gev for top - color assisted technicolor and @xmath38  gev for multiscale technicolor .",
    "some typical values of the technieta partial and total widths are shown in table [ tab : widths ] for @xmath39 and @xmath40  gev .",
    "with the couplings discussed in the previous section we can show that the partonic cross section for the process @xmath41 can be written as :    @xmath42    we wrote a fortran code in order to convolute the above partonic cross section with the cteq4m@xcite partonic distribution functions ( with @xmath43 ) . because the technieta coupling with quarks is proportional to the quark mass",
    ", we neglect the technieta production via @xmath44 interaction . in the case of gluon fusion",
    "we only take into account the @xmath45-channel contribution , which is dominant at the resonance .",
    "it must be noted that gauge invariance is preserved due to the levi - civita tensor present in equation ( [ etagfoton ] ) .",
    "table [ tabsinal ] shows the cross section ( in pb ) calculated for different values of @xmath32 and @xmath35 at @xmath46  gev with a cut in the transverse photon and jet momentum @xmath47  gev .",
    "these values for the cross section agree , with a precision of one percent , with a narrow width approximation . the cross section becomes sizeable for low values @xmath32 and @xmath35 , being of the order of a picobarn .",
    "however , the cross section for the background @xmath48 and @xmath49 processes is @xmath50 pb , which is a factor of @xmath51 larger than the signal .",
    "this situation clearly shows that a detailed kinematical analysis is necessary to work out the strategy to suppress the background as strongly as possible in order to extract the signal .",
    "in order to perform a complete signal and background simulation we use the pythia 5.7 @xcite generator .",
    "effects of jet fragmentation , initial and final state radiation ( isr+fsr ) as well as smearing of the jet and the photon energies have been taken into account .",
    "since the process @xmath52 was absent in pythia we created a generator for @xmath53 process and linked it to pythia as an external user process .",
    "in our simulation we have used cteq4 m structure function and have chosen @xmath43 for the signal .    in this framework we study , for both signal and background , distributions of the transverse photon momentum , transverse jet momentum , rapidity and invariant mass in order to find the optimal kinematical cuts for signal subtraction .",
    "these distributions are shown in fig .",
    "we can see that the isr+fsr and energy smearing effects make the mass distribution ( fig .",
    "[ dist](a ) ) quite broad .",
    "notice the difference in @xmath54 distribution for photons(fig .",
    "[ dist](b ) ) and jets(fig .",
    "[ dist](c ) ) .",
    "the fact that the distribution for jets is wider than for photons is due to initial and final state radiation .",
    "we have found the following optimal set of kinematical cuts : @xmath55 to take into account the detector pseudorapidity coverage we have chosen the following cuts for @xmath56 and @xmath57 : @xmath58    table [ tab : signal_after_cuts ] shows the signal and background cross sections after those cuts have been applied .",
    "it is interesting to look at the values of the significance which is written as @xmath59 and characterizes the statistical deviation of the number of the observed events from the predicted background .",
    "the significance as a function of the @xmath32 for different technicolor models is shown in ( fig.[fig : signif](a ) , where we have assumed a luminosity of @xmath60 pb@xmath61 for the tevatron run ii . for multiscale technicolor ( @xmath38  gev ) , the significance is above the @xmath62 95%  cl exclusion limit for technieta mass less than 350  gev while for a @xmath63 discovery criteria one obtains @xmath64  gev mass limit . for the top - color assisted technicolor model ( @xmath37  gev )",
    "one can establish only a 95%  cl exclusion limit @xmath65  gev .",
    "for the one family technicolor model the significance is too small to establish any limits on @xmath32 .    in our study",
    "we compared results based on pythia simulation and results obtained using madgraph  @xcite and helas@xcite without taking into account isr+fsr and the energy smearing effects .",
    "the corresponding significance for this case is shown in fig.[fig : signif](b ) .",
    "one can see that for this ideal case respective values of significance is about 2.5 times higher than in the case when we model the realistic situation using pythia .",
    "the differences between fig.[fig : signif ] ( a ) and ( b ) clearly shows the importance of the complete simulation of the signal and background in order to obtain realistic results .",
    "finally it is worth pointing out that the study of the @xmath66 signature would lead to similar bounds on the @xmath0 mass .",
    "this is because the signal for @xmath66 final state will be roughly increased by a factor 10 ( see table  [ tab : widths ] ) but the background will be about two orders higher than that for @xmath67 signature .",
    "this would lead to the same values of the significance as for @xmath67 final state .",
    "however , one should take into account also the efficiency of b - tagging which will decrease the significance .",
    "we have studied the potential of the upgraded tevatron collider for the @xmath0 search with @xmath68 decay signature and mass below the @xmath9 threshold .",
    "results have been obtained for the one family model , top - color assisted technicolor and multiscale technicolor .",
    "we found that for multiscale technicolor model , tevatron can exclude @xmath32 up to @xmath69  gev at @xmath70%cl , while the @xmath71 discovery limit for @xmath0 is @xmath72  gev .",
    "for the top - color assisted technicolor model one can only put a @xmath70%cl lower limit on @xmath0 mass equal to @xmath73  gev while for one family technicolor model the significance is too small to establish any limit at all .",
    "study of @xmath66 final state signature is not expected to give better limits on the @xmath0 mass .",
    "we have performed a complete simulation of the signal and background and have shown the importance of taking into account the effects of jet fragmentation , initial and final state radiation , as well as smearing of the jet and the photon energies .",
