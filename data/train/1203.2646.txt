    "the solid evidence for neutrino oscillations and , consequently , for nonzero neutrino masses and mixing , has established leptogenesis  @xcite as one of the most appealing mechanisms to explain the matter - antimatter asymmetry observed today in our universe .",
    "the most attractive feature of this mechanism relies on the fact that the interactions relevant for leptogenesis can simultaneously be responsible for the non - vanishing and smallness of neutrinos masses , once the well - known seesaw mechanism is invoked . among the canonical seesaw realizations , the so - called triplet ( or type ii ) seesaw  @xcite is probably the most economical in the sense that it counts with a single source of flavour structure , namely , the symmetric complex yukawa coupling matrix @xmath2 that couples the @xmath3 scalar triplet @xmath4 to leptons .",
    "furthermore , in its minimal realization , with only one scalar triplet , the flavour pattern of @xmath2 uniquely determines the flavour structure of the low - energy effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath5 . in this regard ,",
    "it is worth recalling that the current solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillation data are consistent with the so - called tri - bimaximal leptonic mixing pattern  @xcite , which from the theoretical point of view seems to call for a discrete family symmetry . along this line",
    "many models have been proposed , with a vast majority relying on the @xmath6 symmetry ( for recent reviews on flavour symmetries see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , leptogenesis can not be successfully implemented in the minimal triplet seesaw scenario .",
    "the cp asymmetry induced by the triplet decays is generated beyond the one - loop level and , consequently , is highly suppressed .",
    "thus , new sources for neutrino masses are necessary to induce the required lepton asymmetry via the out - of - equilibrium triplet decays  @xcite . in the latter case , estimates of the thermal leptogenesis efficiency  @xcite as well as a more precise calculation of it by solving the full set of boltzmann equations  @xcite",
    "indicate that successful leptogenesis typically requires the lightest triplet mass to be large enough , @xmath7  gev , if no extra sources of cp violation are present and lepton flavour effects are not taken into account .    a crucial ingredient of any dynamical mechanism which aims at explaining the baryon asymmetry is the violation of the cp symmetry .",
    "for scalar triplet leptogenesis , the complex yukawa couplings of the higgs triplets to leptons , as well as their complex couplings to the standard higgs doublet , usually provide the necessary source of ( explicit ) cp violation .",
    "alternatively , the required amount of cp violation can be generated if cp is spontaneously broken by the complex vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a scalar field . besides being more attractive from a theoretical viewpoint , the latter framework is also more economical since both the cp violation necessary to generate the baryon asymmetry and leptonic cp violation  @xcite potentially observable at low energies come from a common source , namely , from the phase of the scalar field responsible for the spontaneous cp breaking at a high energy scale  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to present a simple scenario where the above three aspects ( leptogenesis , leptonic mixing and spontaneous cp violation ) are related . to this aim",
    ", we shall add to the standard model ( sm ) a minimal particle content : two higgs triplets @xmath8 with unit hypercharge and a complex scalar singlet @xmath9 with zero hypercharge . in our framework , neutrinos acquire masses via the well - known type ii seesaw mechanism , implemented by the two scalar triplets , and leptogenesis becomes viable due to the out - of - equilibrium decays of the latter in the early universe .",
    "furthermore , we shall assume that the cp symmetry is spontaneously broken at high energies by the complex vev of the singlet @xmath9 , leading to the cp violation required for leptogenesis as well as to low - energy leptonic cp violation . by imposing an @xmath0 flavour symmetry which is spontaneously broken at a high scale with a specific vacuum configuration , the tribimaximal ( tbm ) lepton mixing is obtained .",
    "nonzero values of @xmath1 , required by the neutrino oscillation data from t2k  @xcite and minos  @xcite , arise once we consider small perturbations around the vacuum alignment configuration which leads to exact tbm mixing . we show that in our framework the value of @xmath1 measured by the daya bay reactor neutrino experiment  @xcite can be obtained , leading to large dirac - type cp violation .",
    "finally , we discuss how leptogenesis is realized in order to show that sizable cp asymmetries can be obtained .",
    "moreover , the effective leptogenesis phase can be directly linked to the low - energy leptonic cp - violating phases .",
    "let us consider the sm extended with two higgs triplets @xmath8 of unit hypercharge and a complex scalar singlet @xmath9 with zero hypercharge . in the @xmath10 representation : @xmath11    we impose cp invariance at the lagrangian level and introduce a @xmath12 symmetry under which the scalar and lepton fields transform as follows : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the standard higgs doublet of @xmath3 ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath17 are the sm lepton doublets and right - handed singlets , respectively .",
    "the remaining fields transform trivially under the @xmath12 symmetry .",
    "as it turns out , the above symmetry assignment yields a quite simple and predictive scenario .",
    "the most general scalar potential invariant under the above symmetries can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19,\\\\ v_{s\\phi}&= \\eta_s\\,(s^\\ast s ) ( \\phi^\\dagger \\phi)+ \\eta_s^\\prime\\left(s^2+s^{\\ast 2}\\right ) ( \\phi^\\dagger \\phi),\\\\ v_{s\\delta}&=\\displaystyle\\sum\\nolimits_{a}\\text{tr}\\left(\\delta_a^\\dagger \\delta_a\\right)\\left[\\eta_a\\,(s^2+\\,s^{\\ast 2})+\\xi_a\\,s^\\ast s\\right]\\,,\\\\ v_{\\phi \\delta}&= \\displaystyle\\sum\\nolimits_{a}\\left[\\xi^\\prime_{a}\\,(\\phi^\\dagger\\phi)\\text{tr}\\left(\\delta_a^\\dagger \\delta_a\\right)+ \\xi^{\\prime\\prime}_{a}\\,(\\phi^\\dagger\\delta_a^\\dagger \\delta_a \\phi)\\right ] + ( \\mu_2 m_2 \\tilde{\\phi}^t\\delta_2\\tilde{\\phi } + \\text{h.c . } ) , \\\\",

    "since cp invariance has been imposed at the lagrangian level , all the parameters are assumed to be real .",
    "notice that the choice of the @xmath12 symmetry given in eq .",
    "( [ z4sym ] ) forbids the term @xmath21 which is crucial for the mechanism of leptogenesis to be viable in the present model . yet , once the singlet @xmath9 acquires a complex vev , this term is generated from the scalar potential contribution @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ potterms ] ) .    in order to generate a realistic lepton mixing pattern",
    "we shall also impose an @xmath6 discrete symmetry at high energies ( see discussion in section  [ sawneut ] ) .",

    "we conclude that our framework predicts @xmath39 with @xmath40 , which is large enough to be measured in future oscillation experiments .",
