    "the presence of circumstellar gas around mature stars presents an interesting diagnostic of the formation and evolution of stars and their immediate environments .",
    "a collection of `` shell '' stars , including stars that exhibit strong and sharp absorption features ( e.g. , in ) and sometimes hydrogen emission lines ( i.e. , be stars ) , include many examples of stars in which gas from the stellar atmosphere is deposited in the circumstellar environment via winds @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified @xmath2 pic as an object that displayed strong and sharp absorption in that they postulated might be circumstellar .",
    "indeed , observations with the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) led to the discovery of dust disks around @xmath2  pic ( @xmath6 ; @xcite ) , and other nearby stars , including vega , @xmath7  eri , and @xmath0  psa @xcite .",
    "the gas and dust in the circumstellar environment of @xmath2  pic have been shown to be distributed in an edge - on disk by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "although @xmath2 pic shares some diagnostic characteristics of `` shell '' stars , it has become clear that its observed gas and dust are the secondary products left from the final stages of stellar formation , which has resulted in a debris disk .",
    "therefore , two possible mechanisms exist for depositing substantial amounts of circumstellar gas , one is associated with debris disks and stellar formation and the other with shell stars and stellar winds .    in the process of studying the properties of the circumstellar gas in the dusty edge - on disk surrounding @xmath2 pic , high resolution optical ( and ) spectra showed night - to - night absorption line variability , evidence of a variable circumstellar gas component located close to the star @xcite .",
    "of the four major dust disks discovered by _ iras _ , ( i.e. , @xmath2  pic , vega , @xmath0  psa , and @xmath7  eri ) , only @xmath2  pic shows absorption line variability .",
    "pic is also the only one to have an edge - on orientation , which allows for a detectable optical depth along the line of sight through the midplane of the circumstellar disk , and may explain why it is the only one of the four major dust disks to show gas phase absorption . indeed , if the three - dimensional density profile of in the disk around @xmath2  pic , derived by @xcite , is observed from inclinations consistent with the other three major dust disks , the resulting observable column density falls well below the threshold of detectability .",
    "the formation of stars and planets appears to necessarily include the construction ( and subsequent dispersal ) of disks comprised of gas and dust .",
    "therefore , it is likely that every star has experienced a transitory phase in which the secondary gas and dust products of stellar and planetary formation lead to a debris disk . understanding the process of disk formation , evolution , and dissipation is critical to placing known stellar and planetary systems , including our own , into context .",
    "observations with the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "( _ spitzer _ ) are finding much fainter debris disks than observed toward @xmath2 pic , around much older stars . _",
    "spitzer _ has detected dusty material in stars similar in age to the sun , with @xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas our solar system zodiacal dust emits @xmath910@xmath10 .",
    "in particular , @xcite find that such disks are quite common , with @xmath91/3rd of a sample of @xmath9160 a stars showing infrared ( ir ) excesses due to a debris disk .",
    "if we use @xmath2 pic as a prototypical debris disk , the structure of dust and gas in the circumstellar disk can be characterized by three distinct components .",
    "( 1 ) the large - scale bulk dust disk , which causes an ir excess ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and scattered light emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "( 2 ) the large - scale bulk gas disk , which causes a stable gas absorption feature @xcite . ( 3 ) the variable gas component of the disk , which is located very close to the star and causes gas absorption line variability over short ( e.g. , night - to - night ) timescales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for reviews of the various properties of all the components of the @xmath2 pic debris disk ,",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the source of the variable gas absorption component of the @xmath2 pic disk has received particular attention .",
    "long monitoring campaigns of @xmath2  pic ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , support the theory that the short - term spectral variability is due to gas clouds caused by evaporating , star - grazing , kilometer - sized , cometary - like bodies , simply referred to as , falling evaporating bodies ( feb s ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dynamics and frequency of these events , potentially originating from a mean - motion resonance with a giant planet , can constrain the structure of the disk and even the geometry of a young planetary system @xcite .",
    "no detailed study , comparable to the work on @xmath2 pic , on the variability of gas absorption in an edge - on disk toward a shell or be star has been made to date . despite the fact that gas may be deposited irregularly in the circumstellar environment of rapidly rotating , early type stars via weak stellar winds , like a scaled down version of the disks that form around be stars .",
    "@xcite describe three epochs of observations toward shell stars taken over a 20 year baseline , and note the long term variations in the strength of the gas absorption . in order to understand the origins and structure of circumstellar gas around mature stars it is critical to increase the sample of known edge - on circumstellar gas absorption systems and measure as comprehensively as possible the properties of gas and any dust in the circumstellar environment .",
    "researchers have tried to find other circumstellar gas disks or @xmath2  pic - like systems ( i.e. , edge - on debris disks ) through ir excesses from _ iras _ @xcite and variability ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) . to date",
    ", several other main sequence edge - on circumstellar disk systems have been studied , including @xmath2 car @xcite , hd85905 @xcite , hr10 @xcite , au mic ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) , and hd32297 ( @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "we selected three of the and variable objects ( i.e. , @xmath2 car , hd85905 , and hr10 ) together with @xmath0 oph , which has an anomalously high absorption signature in these ions @xcite , to study any gas and dust in their circumstellar environments .",
    "we monitored their optical absorption properties to probe the stable and variable components of the gas disk ( see section  [ sec : var ] ) .",
    "observations of their ir emission were also made in order to look for any excess due to a dusty debris disk ( see section  [ sec : ddd ] ) .",
    "in addition , we conducted mini - surveys of a handful of stars in close angular proximity to our program stars to look for absorption due to intervening interstellar gas . measuring",
    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) along the line of sight and in the locality directly surrounding a circumstellar disk candidate , is critical to reconstructing the distribution of possible `` contaminating '' ism absorption @xcite . in particular",
    ", the sun resides in a large scale structure known as the local bubble , whose boundary at @xmath9100pc is defined by a significant quantity of interstellar material @xcite .",
    "these mini - surveys allow us to differentiate between a stable circumstellar absorption component and an interstellar absorption feature ( see section  [ sec : nab ] ) .",
    "our program stars are all rapidly rotating , and therefore likely close to edge - on ( i.e. , their @xmath11 places them on the high velocity tail of the distribution of predicted equatorial rotational velocities , and therefore @xmath12 ; * ? ? ?",
    "they are relatively mature systems , with ages of several hundreds of millions of years , based on isochronal fitting ( see section  [ sec : ddd ] ) .",

    "therefore , with evidence that these systems have an edge - on orientation , and ages consistent with the final stages of planetary system formation , our program stars are inviting targets with which to makes observations of secondary gas and dust products that may still reside in their circumstellar environments .",
    "our sample was determined with the intent to investigate @xmath2 pic like systems , that is , edge - on circumstellar disks that are in the evolutionary transition period of clearing their dusty debris disks .",
    "these edge - on transitional systems provide an opportunity to probe properties of both the dust , via ir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , and gas , through atomic absorption lines .",
    "we selected 4 systems , see table  [ tab : basics ] , that were suspected of having gas disks , from absorption line variability on timescales of days to years , or anomalous absorption features that have been difficult to attribute solely to local interstellar medium ( lism ) absorption .",
    "three of the four targets ( hr10 , hd85905 , and @xmath2  car ) show and/or absorption variability @xcite .",
    "the fourth target , @xmath0  oph , has an anomalously large column density compared to observations of other nearby stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed 8 angularly close stars and detected absorption in 2 stars which were significantly more distant ( 120211 pc ) than @xmath0 oph ( 14.3 pc ) , leaving open the possibility that the absorption toward @xmath0 oph is circumstellar in origin .",
    "none of our targets had significant ir excess detections with _ iras _ , although these observations were not sensitive enough to reach the stellar photospheres .    our observational strategy included ( 1 ) continued high resolution optical spectroscopy of our primary targets to monitor the short term variability of atomic absorption lines , section  [ sec : var ] , ( 2 ) observations of several stars close in angle and distance to our primary targets in order to reconstruct the lism absorption profile along the line of sight , and to be able to distinguish between interstellar absorption and a stable circumstellar feature , section  [ sec : nab ] , and ( 3 ) _ spitzer _ observations of the ir sed to search for excess emission from dust and bulk gas emission lines in a circumstellar disk , sections  [ sec : ddd ] and [ sec : ddg ] .",

    "it does show quite strong circumstellar absorption in . the constant absorption in hd85905 , despite the variability in presumably from a circumstellar gas disk , may be a signature of the intervening ism along this line of sight , rather than the circumstellar disk .",
    "the `` contamination '' of interstellar absorption on our observations of gas in circumstellar disks will be discussed in section  [ sec : nab ] where spectra of stars in close angular proximity to our targets are presented .",
    "figure  [ fig : examspec ] shows that variability is detected in 3 of our 4 targets . in order to characterize the absorption profile we use the apparent optical depth ( aod ) method @xcite to calculate the observed column density in each velocity bin .",
    "an alternative characterization would be to model the absorption profile with a series of gaussian components , as is often done in high resolution ism absorption line analysis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is particularly straightforward in observations of the simple absorption profiles seen toward nearby stars , where only 13 components are detected @xcite .",
    "component fitting has also been used successfully to characterize variable absorption due to circumstellar material ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the ability to attach physical properties with the parameters used to fit the series of gaussian absorption profiles is highly sensitive to the physical distinctiveness in projected velocity of the absorbing medium and the resolving power of the spectrograph . in other words ,",
    "a one - to - one correspondence must exist between an absorbing structure and an observed absorption component in order to make meaningful physical measurements .",
    "for example , physical properties ( e.g. , temperature ) can be derived from a gaussian fit to the line width for ism absorption toward the nearest stars , since 1 absorption component is observed and the path length is so short that only 1 absorbing cloud is traversed @xcite .",
    "however , the circumstellar environment giving rise to the variable absorption profiles is likely too complicated ( e.g. , coincident projected velocities from different absorbing sites ) to allow for a straightforward correspondence with a series of gaussian components .",
    "therefore , we employ the aod technique to characterize the observed absorption .    the aod method is well described in @xcite , and has been used extensively to model absorption profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in brief , the apparent optical depth ( @xmath38 ) in velocity ( @xmath39 ) space is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the observed spectrum , and @xmath42 is the continuum spectrum expected if no interstellar or circumstellar absorption were present . in a normalized spectrum ,",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : examspec ] , the stellar background intensities have already been divided out , and @xmath43 .",
    "equation  [ eq : taua ] does not describe the true optical depth , since the instrumental line spread function ( lsf ) is folded into our observed spectrum ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the column density ( @xmath45 ) in each velocity bin can be calculated from the apparent optical depth , @xmath46\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the oscillator strength of the transition , and @xmath48 is the wavelength of the velocity bin .",
    "the total column density can be calculated by integrating @xmath49 over the velocity range of interest .",
    "equation  [ eq : na ] provides accurate total column densities provided the absorption is unsaturated . since both and are doublets",
    ", we have two independent measurements of the absorbed column density in transitions with different oscillator strengths .",
    "a comparison of @xmath49 for the two transitions in each doublet confirms the absorption is unsaturated .",
    "a final @xmath49 is calculated for each ion by taking the weighted mean of @xmath49 calculated for each transition . by utilizing the information from both transitions in the doublet",
    ", the impact of numerous systematic uncertainties ( e.g. , continuum placement , telluric line subtraction , wavelength calibration ) is greatly reduced .",
    "another challenge of evaluating the temporal variability of absorption profiles is amalgamating the data of a long monitoring campaign . even comparing the spectra of only two epochs , as in figure",
    "[ fig : examspec ] , can be confusing . comparing spectra directly in such a way for as many as 26 epochs is impractical .",
    "each observation results in an array of measurements of the column density as a function of velocity ( derived from the normalized flux as a function of wavelength as described above ) .",
    "therefore , we have a sporadic data cube . figures  [ fig : aodaoph][fig : aodhr10 ] are three - dimensional contour plots of observed column density as a function of velocity as a function of time , for all 4 targets .",
    "it is important to note that the observations are sporadic and not continuous in time .",
    "the date of each observation is highlighted with a hatched line , and the contours between epochs are simple interpolations between the two observations .",
    "occasionally closely spaced observations , ( e.g. , @xmath11 week apart ) , can not be distinguished in figures  [ fig : aodaoph][fig : aodhr10 ] and can be associated with an apparent discontinuity .",
    "it is likely that subtle changes , such as in toward @xmath0 oph in figure  [ fig : aodaoph ] or toward hd85905 in figure  [ fig : aodhd85905 ] are caused by systematic effects , whereas obvious circumstellar variability is seen for example in toward hr10 in figure  [ fig : aodhr10 ] .",
    "the short and long - term temporal variability is discussed in detail below . for each target",

    "note that due to the possibility that some of the constant absorption observed toward hd85905 may be interstellar , the to ratio given in table  [ tab : aodmeas ] should be considered a lower limit to the circumstellar ratio of these two ions .",
    "the observed temporal variability and lack of comparable absorption in proximate neighbors demonstrates that most of the absorption detected toward our 3 edge - on disk targets ( @xmath2 car , hd85905 , and hr10 ) is due to circumstellar material .",

    "future work will entail looking for absorption from metastable lines for our three targets that show evidence for circumstellar gas .",
    "the origin of the circumstellar gas in edge - on systems that show absorption line variability is a long - standing question .",
    "the systems studied in this work may qualify as either weak debris disk systems that currently have variable gas located very close to star but very little dust , or weak winded , rapidly rotating , early type stars that expel gas and form disks similar to classical be stars .",
    "the objects studied are relatively mature systems , older than @xmath2 pic ( which is @xmath912 myr ) , but roughly contemporaneous with vega , 0.4 gyr , and @xmath7  eri , 0.6 gyr @xcite .",
    "although most stars at this age have cleared their stellar systems of primordial disk material , several are still in the evolutionary transition period where they have retained a significant amount of secondary dust and gas in their circumstellar surroundings .",
    "the prototypical debris disks mentioned above all have ir excesses , further evidence that the circumstellar material is processed from a protostellar disk .",
    "in addition , the one system that is oriented edge - on ( @xmath2 pic ) also shows gas absorption .",
    "our targets are all a stars similar to @xmath2 pic , and 3 of the 4 show gas absorption at levels lower or comparable to @xmath2 pic ( e.g. , @xmath213hr10@xmath214 pic@xmath215 ) . however , the fractional luminosities caused by an infrared excess consistent with upper limits of the seds of our targets are lower than @xmath2 pic by more than 2 to 3 orders of magnitude @xcite . no stable gas component located at the stellar radial velocity",
    "is detected in our targets , which since for @xmath2 pic , the stable gas appears to be associated with the bulk dust disk @xcite , is consistent with our nondetection of any infrared excess .",
    "however , there remains the difficulty of feeding a variable gas component , most probably by multitudes of star - grazing planetismal small bodies , without creating an observable secondary dust disk through collisions of the same bodies . on the other hand , rapidly rotating b stars with strong radiatively driven winds deposit a significant amount of gas into their circumstellar environments .",
    "these b stars often have strong emission lines ( e.g. , hydrogen ) , and hence are classified as be stars .",
    "the `` be '' phenomenon has also been observed in some early a stars and late o stars , but peaks at spectral types b1b2 @xcite .",
    "a stars can power weak radiatively driven winds , but the mass loss rates are significantly smaller , @xmath216  yr@xmath55 , and only metals are expelled @xcite . over the ages of the stars studied here , even with such a weak wind , enough mass can be delivered to the circumstellar environment to be consistent with our observations , although it does need to be retained relatively close the star .",
    "our stars do not show any hydrogen emission lines in their optical or infrared spectra , but as rapidly rotating early - type stars , they may be able to produce an irregular circumstellar disk from stellar winds . due to the similarity in signatures of gas disks in @xmath2 pic - like debris disks and be star - like stellar wind disks , it is important to keep in mind that it is difficult to distinguish the two based on gas absorption lines alone . in a study of rapidly rotating ( i.e. , edge - on ) a stars similar to our sample , @xcite find that @xmath925% of their stars show absorption .",
    "this is a similar ratio as found for a stars with debris disks at 24 @xmath17 m ; @xmath932% @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that the observed material can not be remnants of star formation because they do not observe absorption at all 3 epochs ( spanning a total of 22 years ) in 3 of their 7 absorption stars .",
    "however , it is plausible that the mechanism causing variability in debris disks , such as @xmath2 pic , can be dramatic enough to result in nondetections of gas absorption , particularly in weak sources , as 2 of their 3 variable absorption stars are .",
    "although the similarity of detection fraction in these two studies may be a coincidence , it would be interesting to search for ir excesses around these absorbers to look for any remnants of protostellar dust .",
    "detections of dust around our stars that have variable circumstellar gas absorption would have strengthened their identification as debris disk systems rather than stellar outflow disks . however , ir excess nondetections leave the origin of the observed gas disks an open question",

    "debris disks @xcite . at the same time , if there is actually little or no dust in these systems , it is quite possible that the origin of the variable circumstellar gas disk is stellar winds .",
    "expanding the sample and further monitoring of the gas content in edge - on systems will help resolve this issue .",

    "absorption levels drop off rapidly indicating a small and possibly filamentary lism structure in that direction .",
