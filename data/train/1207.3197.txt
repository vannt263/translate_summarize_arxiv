    "fig : setup ] is described by the hamiltonian @xmath1 , where ( in units with @xmath2 ) @xmath3 refers to the triple quantum dot with vanishing onsite energies .",
    "we assume strong coulomb repulsion such that the triple dot can be occupied with at most one electron .",
    "hence the electron spin has no relevant influence and will be ignored . by applying appropriate gate voltages to the inter - dot barriers ,",
    "the tunnel matrix elements between neighboring dots , @xmath4 and @xmath0 , are controlled such that they assume the sequence of double gauss pulses @xmath5 , \\ ] ] with amplitude @xmath6 , width @xmath7 , delay time @xmath8 , and repetition time @xmath9 as is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : timeevolution](a ) .",
    "this implies the time periodicity @xmath10 for @xmath11 with some time - offest @xmath12 .",
    "ideally , one would like to modify the control parameters @xmath13 adiabatically slowly to ensure ideal accomplishment of the protocol .",
    "this however is not possible , because a lower limit to the ctap duration is set by decoherence , which may stem from substrate phonons , a detector , or as in the present case the coupling to leads .",
    "for the transient dynamics during a total propagation time @xmath14 considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , decoherence is tolerable for the pulse parameters @xmath15 .",
    "here we use @xmath16 as pulse repetition time and focus on the steady state .",
    "an important feature of the ctap double pulse is its `` counter - intuitive '' order @xcite , which means that the coupling @xmath17 is active before @xmath18 .",
    "this requirement can be understood upon noticing that @xmath19 is an eigenstate of the single - particle hamiltonian in the basis @xmath20 . between the maxima of the double peak ,",
    "this eigenstate changes from @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the adiabatic time evolution of an electron starting in dot  1 is as deserved , namely it undergoes a direct transition to dot  3 without populating dot  2 .     and driving periods ( b ) @xmath23 and ( c ) @xmath24 . ]",
    "the leads are modeled as free electron gases with the hamiltonian @xmath25 , where @xmath26 creates an electron in state @xmath27 of lead @xmath28 .",
    "the coupling of dot  1 to the left lead is given by the tunnel hamiltonian @xmath29 and @xmath30 accordingly .",
    "the lead coupling is fully determined by its spectral density @xmath31 .",
    "if all relevant dot energies lie within the voltage window of the two leads , electron transport becomes unidirectional .",
    "then one can derive for the reduced triple dot density operator @xmath32 within a bloch - redfield approach the master equation @xcite @xmath33    + \\gamma\\mathcal{d}(c_1^\\dagger)\\rho    + \\gamma\\mathcal{d}(c_3)\\rho \\equiv \\mathcal{l}(t)\\rho\\ ] ] with the lindblad form @xmath34 .",
    "the dissipative superoperators @xmath35 and @xmath36 describe incoherent tunneling from the left lead ( source ) to dot  1 and from dot  3 to the right lead ( drain ) , respectively .",
    "the fluctuations of the current can be characterized by the current auto correlation function @xmath37 which is typically measured at low frequencies .",
    "therefore , we focus on the zero - frequency limit in which the correlation function relates to the variance of the transported charge according to @xmath38 @xcite , where @xmath39 is the elementary charge . the variance can be computed with the help of a density operator @xmath40 that is augmented by counting variable @xmath41 and possesses the limit @xmath42 .",
    "its trace @xmath43 is the moment generating function for the number of transported electrons @xmath44 , i.e. , @xmath45 . for unidirectional transport",
    ", @xmath46 obeys the master equation @xmath47 @xcite , where @xmath48 is the jump operator contained in the lindblad form . exploiting the @xmath49 periodicity in @xmath41 ,",
    "one frequently continues with a fourier transformation which yields the so - called @xmath44-resolved master equation @xcite .",
    "then however , a major technical problem arises , because one has to consider many additional degrees of freedom , such that a numerical solution becomes rather expensive .",
    "a more economic approach has been developed in refs .",
    "@xcite . by taylor expansion up to second order , @xmath50 , one obtains the equations of motion @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which we solve by numerical propagation .",
    "then we use the fact that @xmath53 is the moment generating function , so that @xmath54 , by which we finally obtain the current @xmath55 and the zero - frequency noise @xmath56 . for transport in periodically time - dependent conductors , these quantities must be considered in the average over the driving period @xcite .    the relative noise strength is characterized by the fano factor @xmath57 which provides information about the transport mechanism @xcite . for a poisson process it has value one , while it becomes smaller for more regular transport . in the present context , we will speak of `` significant shot noise suppression '' if the fano factor lies clearly below 1/2 .",
    "in order to acquire insight into the system dynamics , we time integrate master equation by a runge - kutta method .",
    "we start with an empty triple quantum dot just before the first double pulse sets in and obtain the time evolution of the dot occupations depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : timeevolution](b ) . at the initial stage , @xmath58 , dot  1 becomes populated by an electron that tunnels in from the left lead . between the peaks of the double pulse [ cf.panel  ( a ) ] , the electron essentially undergoes a direct transfer to dot  3 . as non - adiabatic correction",
    ", dot  2 acquires some occupation , which however stays clearly below the occupation of the other dots . after the double pulse",
    ", the electron tunnels further to the right lead , and a next electron may enter at dot  1 .",
    "the fast oscillation of @xmath59 when inter - dot tunneling is active can be identified as tunnel oscillation between the middle dot and one of its neighbors , because its frequency is roughly @xmath60 @xcite . for certain values of the driving period @xmath9 [ panel ( c ) ] ,",
    "these oscillations become larger and may interfere constructively , so that dot  2 acquires a larger occupation .",
    "if all tunnel matrix elements were constant in time , the population of all three dots were about equal ( not shown ) .",
    "thus , our transport process must be dominated by ctap if the occupation of the middle dot is considerably smaller than the occupation of the other two dots . in the ideal case",
    ", the steady state will be such that with each double pulse , one electron is transported .",
    "this gives rise to a regular current , so that shot noise is suppressed .",
    "in the following , we analyze this current and will find that the proper course of the ctap protocol correlates with small noise manifest in the fano factor .",
    "for computing the current noise , we need to solve simultaneously master equation and the equation of motion for @xmath61 , as discussed above .",
    "since we are interested in the long - time behavior , we eliminate transient effects by considering the results only after all elements of the density matrix have changed by less than 0.25% with respect to the previous period .",
    "convergence is typically reached after five to ten double pulses .    , and ( b ) fano factor @xmath62 in the steady - state limit as function the pulse repetition time @xmath9 and the dot - lead coupling @xmath63 .",
    "for graphical reasons , the data are clipped at the values 0.5 and 1 , respectively . ]",
    "figure  [ fig:2d ] provides an overview of the global behavior as function of the driving period @xmath9 and the dot - lead coupling @xmath63 . for the time - averaged occupation of dot  2 shown in panel ( a ) , we distinguish three regions .",
    "first , for @xmath64 in which the driving is too fast , such that non - adiabatic effects play a strong role , and we can not expect ctap to work properly . accordingly , the average population @xmath65 may take any value .",
    "the corresponding fano factor [ panel ( b ) ] is about 1/2 or larger , i.e. , there is no relevant shot noise suppression .",
    "notice the similarity of the dot occupation with the one observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , despite that there transient dynamics with phenomenological decoherence was considered .    for larger driving periods ,",
    "we find a broad region in which the population of the middle dot is rather low , unless the dot - lead coupling @xmath63 becomes too large . in particular ,",
    "we find islands in which both the average and the maximum of the mean occupation is as small as @xmath66 .",
    "the plot for the fano factor exhibits a similar structure , where both @xmath67 and @xmath65 assume small values for roughly the same parameters .",
    "this provides a first hint that our generalized ctap gives rise to regular , low - noise electron transport , in particular when @xmath63 is of the order @xmath6 .",
    "interestingly , for certain values of @xmath9 , dot  2 becomes occupied and the fano factor increases accordingly .",
    "this can be attributed to the mentioned tunnel oscillations , because the distance between two peaks increases linearly with the amplitude @xmath6 .     and time - averaged population @xmath65 for the dot - lead couplings ( a ) @xmath68 and ( b ) @xmath69 .",
    "the horizontal dotted line marks the value @xmath70 which is the minimal reminiscent population of dot  2 .",

    "( b ) correlation coefficient of the fano factor and  @xmath65 in the range @xmath71 $ ] ( solid line ) and the corresponding minimum and maximum of the fano factor ( dashed ) . ]    for a more quantitative analysis , we depict in fig .",
    "[ fig : cut ] the time - averaged steady - state occupation @xmath65 and the fano factor for two relatively small values of the dot - lead coupling @xmath63 .",
    "this demonstrates that the population of dot  2 can be as low as @xmath70 , while it becomes roughly @xmath72 in the intermediate region .",
    "accordingly , the fano factor changes from a significantly sub - poissonian value to @xmath73 . the dc current [ inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:2d](a ) ] , by contrast , exhibits only minor signatures of ctap .",
    "this underlines that it is indeed the noise which provides information about the nature of the transport process .",
    "moreover , it reveals that for the relatively small @xmath9 considered , on average only each second double pulse transports an electron .",
    "this value can be improved by increasing @xmath9 which , however , requires a smaller dot - lead tunneling @xmath63 .",
    "we quantify the relation between the population @xmath65 and the fano factor @xmath67 by the correlation coefficient @xmath74 between these quantities for @xmath9 in the relevant interval @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "the numerator denotes the covariance , while the denominator contains the standard deviations , such that @xmath75 for ideal correlation .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : cut](b ) shows that for @xmath76 , the correlation is rather high , typically @xmath77 or larger .",
    "moreover , the difference between the maximum and the minimum of the fano factor , @xmath78 , is roughly @xmath79 , i.e. , sufficiently large to be discriminated in an experiment @xcite . for larger values of @xmath63 , the fano factor and the population",
    "become significantly anti - correlated .",
    "there however , @xmath78 is quite small and may be below the experimental resolution .",
    "therefore we do not further discuss the regime @xmath80 .    in a possible experimental realization of steady - state ctap , the oscillatory dependence of the fano factor as function of the pulse distance @xmath9 may serve as indicator .",
    "most significant results are expected for @xmath81 .",
    "thus , one may use a triple quantum dot whose four barriers have similar transparency .",
    "negative gate voltages applied to the inner barriers allow one to control the tunnel matrix elements .",
    "since the average current consists of roughly half electron per double pulse , a current @xmath82 requires a repetition rate of 100mhz @xcite .",
    "the maximal tunnel rates should be considerably larger than that , say , by a factor 10 , which means that @xmath63 and @xmath6 should be of order @xmath83 .",
    "we have proposed a ctap protocol for a triple quantum dot in transport configuration , i.e. , when the first dot and the last dot are coupled to electron source and drain .",
    "it induces a steady - state transport in which electrons tunnel non - locally from the first to the last dot , practically without populating the middle dot .",
    "the noise properties of the resulting current depend on the size of the reminiscent population .",
    "the difference is manifested in the fano factor which , thus , represents a fingerprint of the proper course of the protocol .",
    "such indirect evidence for ctap is particularly useful , because any direct measurement of the dot occupations would act back on the system and , thus , unavoidably influence the effect to be substantiated .",
    "a particular feature of steady - state ctap is that it fails for certain distances between pulse pairs .",
    "thus , upon changing this distance , one obtains a sequence of sizable shot noise suppression and shot noise enhancement , which should be measurable by standard techniques .",
    "thus , our proposal may initiate the experimental realization of this intriguing non - local transport phenomenon .",
