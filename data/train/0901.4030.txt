    "we say that the pair @xmath9 is an _ algebraic basketball _ , and call @xmath7 the _ real component _ of the basketball .",

    "both real algebraic curves @xmath7 and @xmath8 are harmonic .",
    "thus , by the maximum principle , they have no bounded connected component ( `` ovals '' in the classical terminology ) .",
    "they are each made up of @xmath0 branches that go to infinity , and there is no bounded open region of @xmath6 whose boundary is entirely made up of portion of the curves @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "for any suitably large radius @xmath10-centered circle @xmath11 , each of the curves @xmath7 and @xmath8 meet @xmath11 in @xmath12 points that are close to the vertices of a regular @xmath12-gon inscribed in @xmath11 , and all self - intersections or intersections between the two curves lie inside @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath12 points that arise from the intersection @xmath13 are interlaced with those coming from @xmath14 .",
    "this phenomena is illustrated in figure  [ exemple ] , where the thick ( blue ) curves correspond to @xmath7 and the thin ( red ) ones correspond to @xmath8 .",
    "a copy of one of of gauss own figures is presented in figure  [ figure_gauss ] .",
    "in other words , as the modulus of @xmath15 goes to infinity , the branches of @xmath7 ( resp .",
    "@xmath8 ) can asymptotically be identified to those of @xmath16 ( resp .",

    "we call the resulting equivalence classes _ combinatorial basketballs _ or simply _ basketballs_. these combinatorial structures describe the mutual intersections between branches of @xmath7 ( and @xmath8 ) , and how half - branches are comnected",

    "these are going to become internal vertices of our combinatorial structure .",
    "since such self intersection arise at points that are multiple roots of @xmath27 , for some @xmath28 in @xmath29 , the vertex has an even number of `` edges '' attached to it . at a vertex one crosses over to continue on the edge that sit opposite to the incoming edge .",

    "our objective is to describe a semi - algebraic cell decomposition of @xmath40 , where each cell is characterized by a combinatorial basketball .",
    "we also consider a coarser decomposition with cells indexed by `` circular forests '' ( further discussed in the next section ) corresponding to the real components of basketballs .",
    "this approach makes evident that the set of basketballs , as well as the set of circular forests , is endowed with a graded poset structure corresponding naturally to the inclusion of a cell in the closure of another .",
    "in particular we consider the enumeration of cells by degree . some of the nice results of @xcite can be considered as the study of certain equivalence classes of closed paths in the space @xmath40 , where these paths only go through cells of co - degree @xmath42 .",
    "our previous discussion implies that both components ( @xmath43 and @xmath8 ) of a basketball , are homeomorphic to forests of trees with @xmath12 leaves ( corresponding to the half - branches that go to infinity ) , with each internal node of even degree . moreover there is a cyclic structure on the half - edges surrounding any internal vertex .",
    "we thus call them _ circular forests_. there is also clearly a unique branch starting at any given leaf , and it must necessarily end at another leaf . in figure",

    "such a circular forest is made up of @xmath0 branches .",
    "these branches establish a matching ( we sometines say a @xmath0-matching ) between the @xmath67 leaves of the forest .",
    "it is not hard to check that this matching entirely characterizes the circular forest , and branches can be identified with pairs @xmath68 of elements of @xmath50 .",
    "we sometimes denote such pair simply as @xmath69 .    with our previous terminology , two branches @xmath69 and @xmath70 cross if @xmath71 in other terms , they share an internal vertex .",
    "more generally , for @xmath72 , several branches @xmath73 , of a forest @xmath74 , go through one common vertex if and only if we have @xmath75 for some correct choice of the labels @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "thus the vertices of a forest @xmath74 are characterized as maximal sets of branches @xmath78 such that condition ( [ sommet ] ) hold . to characterize the @xmath0-matchings of the @xmath12 points of @xmath50 associated to circular forests , we proceed as follows .",

    "the matchings associated to circular forests are exactly those that contain only crossing cycles that correspond to vertices , i.e. : crossing cycles satisfying condition ( [ sommet ] ) .",
    "another notion along these lies that will be useful later is that of _ crossing set _ @xmath84 of a circular forest @xmath74 .",

    "each branch of @xmath88 meets at least one branch of @xmath89 , and vice - versa .",
    "3 .   the union of @xmath88 and @xmath89 is a circular forest .",
    "combinatorial @xmath0-basketball _ is an _",
    "pair @xmath90 of circular forests , each with @xmath12 leaves .",
    "we intend combinatorial basketballs to be representatives of homotopy classes of algebraic basketballs in the sense of section  [ intro ] .",
    "a combinatorial basketball @xmath90 is said to be _ non - singular _ if and only if both @xmath88 and @xmath89 are non - singular .",

    "thus , up to a rescaling , we may as well suppose that @xmath11 is the unit circle and that @xmath50 is the set of points @xmath95 in the case of @xmath7 , and @xmath96 in the case of @xmath8 .",
    "as before , these points are labelled form @xmath10 to @xmath97 going counterclockwise .",
    "each half - branch ( corresponding to one of these points ) is connected through a branch to a unique other half - branch .",
    "we get in this way a natural decomposition of @xmath88 ( and @xmath89 ) into @xmath0 branches .",
    "the fact that in an algebraic basketball the union of @xmath7 and @xmath8 is a circular forest is readily deduced from the simple observation that @xmath98",

    "each cell @xmath102 is semi - algebraically homeomorphic to some open hypercube of dimension @xmath103 , and we say that @xmath102 is a @xmath104-cell .",

    "the second decomposition , denoted @xmath107 , is the _ basketballs - cell - decomposition_. thus , the coefficient of @xmath108 in @xmath109 is the catalan number , whereas in @xmath110 it is number given by formula ( [ formule_non_sing ] ) .    there is a natural graded poset structure on the cells of a decomposition .",
    "namely one sets @xmath111 if @xmath112 is included in the closure of @xmath113 , and the grading is given by the degree of the cells . in terms of circular forests , the order can be characterized as follows .",
    "the cell corresponding to a circular forest @xmath114 is smaller than the cell associated to @xmath115 , if and only if the crossing set of @xmath114 contains the crossing set of @xmath115 . in formula",
