    "despite the fact that massive planets are easier to detect , the mass distribution of detected planets is strongly peaked toward the lowest detectable masses . and despite the fact that short period planets are easier to detect , the period distribution is strongly peaked toward the longest detectable periods . in lineweaver & grether ( 2002",
    ", hereafter lg ) we quantified these trends as accurately as possible . here",
    "we update this analysis by including the 27 exoplanets detected between january and august 2002 . as in lg",
    ", we identify a less - biased subsample of exoplanets ( thick rectangle of fig .",
    "1 ) . within this subsample ,",
    "we correct for completeness and then quantify trends in mass and period ( fig .",
    "2 ) that are less biased than trends based on the full sample of exoplanets . straightforward extrapolations of these trends , into the area of parameter space occupied by jupiter ,",
    "indicates that jupiter lies in a region densely occupied by exoplanets .",
    "naef et al .",
    "( 2001 ) point out that none of the planetary companions detected so far resembles the giants of the solar system .",
    "however , this observational fact is consistent with the idea that our solar system is a typical planetary system . fig .",
    "1 shows that selection effects can easily explain the lack of detections of jupiter - like planets .",
    "exoplanets detected to date can not resemble the planets of our solar system because the doppler technique used to detect exoplanets has not been sensitive enough to detect jupiter - like planets .",
    "we may be sampling the tail of a distribution  the only part that we are capable of sampling . if the sun were a target star in one of the doppler surveys , no planet would have been detected around it .",
    "this situation is about to change .",
    "our analysis suggests that jupiter is more typical than indicated by previous analyses , including our own ( lg ) .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "2 , our @xmath0 slope is slightly steeper than the @xmath1 found in lg and is steeper than the @xmath2    of other previous analyses ( jorissen , mayor & udry 2001 , zucker & mazeh 2002 , tabachnik & tremaine 2001 ) .",
    "this means that ( within the same period range ) instead of @xmath3 mass exoplanets being twice as common as @xmath4 exoplanets , we find they are slightly more than three times as common .",
    "similarly we find there are @xmath5 times as many @xmath6 as @xmath3 exoplanets .",
    "when the histogram of all 98 (= 101- 3 brown dwarfs ) exoplanets is fit , including the highly under - sampled lowest @xmath7 bin , the result is @xmath8 .",
    "this should be compared to the @xmath9 of earlier fits ( lg ) and can be found in marcy et al . 2002 .",
    "this value of @xmath10 is close to the @xmath11 found for very low mass stars ( bejar et al .",
    "when the lowest exoplanet @xmath12 bin is ignored because of known incompleteness we obtain @xmath1 ( lg reported @xmath13 for this case ) . fitting the @xmath7 histogram of the less - biased sample of 52 exoplanets , uncorrected for under - sampling , yields @xmath1 ( lg reported @xmath14 ) . after correcting for under - sampling ( with a 4 planet correction ) we obtain our final result : @xmath15 ( lg reported @xmath16 ) .",
    "the 27 exoplanets detected between january and august 2002 fit the trends quantified in lg but also indicate that the slopes are even slightly steeper and thus that jupiters are slightly more common than indicated by lg .",
    "the biggest uncertainty in this analysis is not the linear approximation used to make the necessary completeness correction ",
    "it is probably not knowing how far one can reasonably extrapolate the trends identified .",
    "the surface density of the material in the protoplanetary disk available to make planets has to decrease and then drop off at some point .",
    "thus , there is a danger of extrapolating a trend into this region  but",
    "where is it ?",
    "this uncertainty is why we did not extend our analysis to saturn s orbit and declare more speculatively that saturns are typical gaseous planets .",
    "however , since the exoplanet data indicates that jupiters are common and we know of no models in which jupiters are formed readily but saturns are not , we see no reason to believe that this eventual drop off is near the region ( inner edge of the ice zone between 4 and 10 au ) where abundant material is expected .",
    "thus , since the data indicates that jupiters are abundant , the most reasonable hypothesis is that saturns probably are too .",
    "exoplanet data on saturns ( @xmath17 year orbital period ) may be available in a decade or two ."
