    "we shall show that there are ( at least ) six compellingly reasonable related model structures on the category of dg modules over a dg algebra , and we shall show how some of these model structures relate to explicit computations .",
    "in fact , calculational applications were announced in 1968 @xcite and explained in the 1974 memoir @xcite and its 2002 generalization @xcite . in @xcite , we gave ad hoc definitions of differential @xmath29 functors ( called `` torsion products '' in those days ) and ext functors in terms of certain general types of resolutions .",
    "we wrote then that our definitions have `` the welcome merit of brevity , although we should admit that this is largely due to the fact that we can offer no categorical justification ( in terms of projective objects , etc ) for our definitions . '' among other things , at the price of some sacrifice of brevity , we belatedly give model categorical justifications here .",
    "we let @xmath30 denote the category of unbounded chain complexes over a fixed ring @xmath1 , which we always call dg @xmath1-modules .",
    "we have two natural categories of weak equivalences in @xmath30 .",
    "we define @xmath31-equivalences to be homotopy equivalences of dg @xmath1-modules and @xmath32-equivalences to be quasi - isomorphisms , namely those maps of dg @xmath1-modules that induce an isomorphism on passage to the homology of the underlying chain complexes .",
    "we call the subcategories consisting of these classes of weak equivalences @xmath33 and @xmath34 . since chain homotopic maps induce the same map on homology , @xmath35 .",
    "both categories are closed under retracts and satisfy the two out of three property .",
    "similarly , it will be evident that all classes of cofibrations and fibrations that we define in this paper are subcategories closed under retracts .    as usual",
    ", let @xmath36 denote the homotopy category of @xmath30 obtained by identifying homotopic maps ; it is called the classical homotopy category of @xmath30 .",
    "also as usual , let @xmath37 denote the category obtained from @xmath30 ( or @xmath36 ) by inverting the quasi - isomorphisms ; it is called the derived category of @xmath1",
    ". we recall three familiar model structures on @xmath30 that lead to these homotopy categories in  [ secqmodelr ] ,  [ sechmodelr ] , and  [ 1mixed ] .",
    "they are analogues of the quillen , classical , and mixed model structures on spaces @xcite .",
    "we name them as follows .",

    "we can mix these two model structures .",
    "since we will shortly have several mixed model structures in sight , we denote this one in @xcite , @xmath43 standing for mixed .",
    "] by @xmath44 its homotopy category is again @xmath37 . for clarity of exposition ,",
    "we defer all discussion of mixed model structures like this to  [ 6model ] .    in  [ chainch ] and  [ 1mixed ] , we allow the ring @xmath1 to be non - commutative . except in these sections",
    ", we use the short - hand @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath47 and @xmath48 . as we explain in  [ rmod ] ,",
    "when @xmath1 is commutative the @xmath41-model structure on @xmath30 has an alternative conceptual interpretation in terms of _ enriched _ lifting properties and _ enriched _ weak factorization systems .",
    "it is compactly generated in an enriched sense , although it is _ not _ compactly or cofibrantly generated in the traditional sense . here",
    "`` compactly generated '' is a variant of `` cofibrantly generated '' that applies when only sequential cell complexes are required .",
    "it is described in and discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the variant is essential to the philosophy expounded in this paper since use of sequential cell complexes is needed if one is to forge a close calculational connection between the abstract cell complexes of model category theory and the concrete cell complexes that arise from analogues of projective resolutions . after all , projective resolutions in homological algebra are never given transfinite filtrations .",
    "starting in  [ dgach ] , we also fix a ( @xmath49-graded ) dg @xmath1-algebra @xmath0 .",
    "thus @xmath0 is a dg @xmath1-module and an @xmath1-algebra with a unit cycle in degree zero and a product @xmath50 that commutes with the differentials .",
    "our conventions on graded structures are that we never add elements in different degrees .",
    "the product is given by maps @xmath51 and the differential is given by maps @xmath52 .",

    "an object @xmath6 in @xmath13 is a dg @xmath1-module @xmath6 with an @xmath0-module structure @xmath54 that commutes with the differentials .",
    "we use the term @xmath0-module when we choose to forget the differential and consider only the underlying ( graded ) @xmath0-module structure , as we shall often have occasion to do .    in  [ dgach ] , which is parallel to  [ chainch ] ,",
    "we define quillen and classical model structures on @xmath13 , using the same notations as in ( 0.1 ) and ( 0.2 ) .",
    "the maps in @xmath34 are the quasi - isomorphisms and the maps in @xmath55 are the homotopy equivalences of dg @xmath0-modules .",
    "the @xmath32-fibrations , like the @xmath32-equivalences , are created in @xmath30 and thus depend only on the underlying dg @xmath1-modules .",
    "the @xmath31-fibrations are the maps that satisfy the covering homotopy property in the category @xmath13 ; they do not appear to admit an easily verifiable characterization in more familiar algebraic terms .",
    "we defer discussion of the associated mixed model structure generalizing ( 0.3 ) to  [ 3mixed ] .",
    "there is a subtlety in proving the factorization axioms for the @xmath31-model structure , but to minimize interpolations of general theory in the direct line of development , we have deferred the relevant model categorical underpinnings to  [ appendix ] .",
    "if @xmath0 has zero differential , the @xmath31-and @xmath32-model structures and the associated mixed model structure are the obvious generalizations from ungraded rings @xmath1 to graded rings @xmath0 of the model structures in  [ secqmodelr ] and  [ sechmodelr ] , and the differential adds relatively little complication .",
    "these model structures are independent of the assumption that @xmath0 is an @xmath1-algebra , encoding no more information than if we regard @xmath0 as a dg ring .",
    "we are interested in model structures that remember that @xmath0 is an @xmath1-algebra .",
    "we define @xmath56 to be the category of maps of dg @xmath0-modules that are homotopy equivalences of dg @xmath1-modules .",
    "these are the appropriate equivalences for _ relative _ homological algebra , which does remember @xmath1 . of course , @xmath57 we consider @xmath56 to be a very natural category of weak equivalences in @xmath13 , and we are interested in model structures with these weak equivalences and their relationship with model structures that take @xmath55 or @xmath34 as the weak equivalences .    we have three homotopy categories of dg @xmath0-modules .",
    "we let @xmath58 denote the ordinary homotopy category of @xmath13 and call it the absolute homotopy category .",
    "it is obtained from @xmath13 by passing to homotopy classes of maps or , equivalently , by inverting the homotopy equivalences of dg @xmath0-modules .",
    "we let @xmath59 denote the homotopy category obtained by formally inverting the @xmath41-equivalences .",
    "we let @xmath60 denote the category obtained from @xmath13 , or equivalently from @xmath58 or @xmath61 , by formally inverting the quasi - isomorphisms .",
    "it is called the _ derived category _ of the category of dg @xmath0-modules .",
    "we call @xmath59 the _ relative derived category _ of @xmath0 .",
    "we hope to convince the reader that @xmath59 is as natural and perhaps even as important as @xmath60 .",
    "in  [ sec : rmodel ] , we construct the relative model structure @xmath62 the @xmath41-fibrations are the maps in @xmath13 that are @xmath41-fibrations (= @xmath31-fibrations ) when regarded as maps in @xmath30 .",
    "that is , like the @xmath41-equivalences , the @xmath41-fibrations are created by the @xmath41-model structure on @xmath30 . here",
    "again there is a subtlety in the proof of the factorization axioms , discussion of which is deferred to  [ appendix ] .",
    "along with the inclusions @xmath63 , we have inclusions @xmath64 there result three mixed model structures on @xmath13 , the @xmath65-model structure @xmath66 and the @xmath67-model structure @xmath68 joining the @xmath69-model structure @xmath70 that generalizes ( 0.3 ) .",
    "we discuss these in ",
    "[ 3mixed ] .",
    "they have advantages over the @xmath32- and @xmath41-model structures analogous to those described in ",
    "[ 1mixed ] and in more detail in @xcite in the classical case of model structures on @xmath30 .    in all of these model structures ,",
    "all objects are fibrant . by an observation of joyal ,",
    "two model structures with the same cofibrations and fibrant objects are the same ( cf .",
    "thus , in principle , our six model structures differ only in their cofibrations .",
    "we shall see in  [ appendix ] that recent work in model category theory @xcite illuminates the cofibrations in our new model structures .",
    "however , the distinction we emphasize is seen most clearly in the fibrations .",
    "the lifting property that defines @xmath32-fibrations implies that they are degreewise surjections .",
    "the lifting property that defines @xmath41-fibrations implies that they are degreewise split surjections .",
    "the splittings promised by the lifting properties are merely functions in the former case , but they are maps of @xmath1-modules in the latter case .",
    "the new theory explains the distinction in terms of enriched model category theory .",
    "as we describe in  [ rmod ] , when @xmath1 is commutative the @xmath71-model structure on @xmath30 is the @xmath1-module enrichment of its @xmath32-model structure , in a sense that we shall make precise .",
    "similarly , as we explain in  [ sec : rmodel ] , the @xmath41-model structure on @xmath13 is the @xmath1-module enrichment of its @xmath32-model structure .",
    "the construction of our @xmath31- and @xmath41-model structures on @xmath13 requires new model theoretic foundations , without which we would not know how to prove the factorization axioms . in ",
    "[ appendix ] , we introduce `` enriched '' and `` algebraic '' generalizations of garner s variant of quillen s small object argument ( soa ) .",
    "we shall implicitly use garner s variant in all of our model theoretic work , and we shall use its generalized versions to obtain the required factorizations .",
    "this material is of independent interest in model category theory , and we have collected it in  [ appendix ] both to avoid interrupting the flow and to make it more readily accessible to readers interested in other applications .",
    "these results expand on work of two of us in @xcite , where mistakes in the literature concerning @xmath31-model structures in topology are corrected .",
    "the new variants of the soa provide systematic general ways to construct interesting model structures that are not cofibrantly generated in the classical sense .",
    "as the quite different applications in @xcite and here illustrate , the new theory can be expected to apply to a variety of situations to which the ordinary soa does not apply .",
    "that is a central theme of part 1 .    in part 2",
    ", we are especially interested in understanding @xmath32- and @xmath41-cofibrant approximations and relating them to projective resolutions in traditional homological algebra .",
    "we shall give three homological constructions of cofibrant approximations that a priori bear no obvious relationship to the model theoretic cofibrant approximations provided by either the classical or the enriched soa .",
    "beginning with @xmath32-cofibrant approximations , we show in  [ versus ] that the classical projective resolutions of dg @xmath1-modules that cartan and eilenberg introduced and used to construct the knneth spectral sequence in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* xvii ) give @xmath32-cofibrant approximations of dg @xmath1-modules , even though they are specified as bicomplexes with no apparent relationship to the retracts of @xmath32-cell complexes that arise from model category theory .",
    "they are _ isomorphic _ to such retracts , but there is no obvious way to construct the isomorphisms , which can be viewed as changes of filtrations .    more generally , in  [ versustoo ] we show that we can obtain @xmath32-cofibrant approximations of dg @xmath0-modules as the total complexes @xmath72 of projective resolutions @xmath73 , where the @xmath73 are suitable bicomplexes .",
    "the construction is due to moore @xcite , generalizing cartan and eilenberg ( * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath72 must be retracts of @xmath32-cell complexes , but , as bicomplexes , they come in nature with entirely different non - cellular filtrations and it is not obvious how to compare filtrations . precisely because they are given in terms of bicomplexes , they allow us to prove some things that are not readily accessible to @xmath32-cell complexes .",
    "for example , these @xmath32-cofibrant approximations allow us to derive information from the assumption that the underlying @xmath0-module of a dg @xmath0-module is flat and to view the eilenberg - moore spectral sequence ( emss ) as a generalized knneth spectral sequence under appropriate hypotheses .",
    "we head towards alternative cofibrant approximations in  [ gmstuff ] .",
    "we give theorems that characterize the @xmath32- and @xmath41-cofibrations and cofibrant objects in the parallel sections  [ qchar ] and  [ rchar ] . in  [ splitone ] and  [ splittwo ] , we introduce a common generalization of model theoretic cell dg @xmath0-modules and the total complexes @xmath72 of projective resolutions , together with a concomitant generalization of model theoretic cofibrations .",
    "the key notion is that of a split dg @xmath0-module , which was already defined in @xcite .",
    "the model theoretic @xmath32-cell and @xmath41-cell dg @xmath0-modules , the projective dg @xmath0-modules of  [ versustoo ] , and the classical bar resolutions are all examples of split dg @xmath0-modules .",
    "we single out a key feature of split dg @xmath0-modules . prior to @xcite ,",
    "differential homological algebra used only bicomplexes , as in our  [ projqcof ] .",
    "split dg @xmath0-modules are `` multicomplexes , '' which means that they are filtered and have differentials with filtration - lowering components that are closely related to the differentials of the associated spectral sequences .",
    "we now see that the generalization from bicomplexes to multicomplexes in @xcite , which then seemed esoteric and artificial , is forced by model theoretic considerations : our @xmath32- and @xmath41-model structures are constructed in terms of @xmath32-cell and @xmath41-cell complexes , as dictated by the soa , and these are multicomplexes , almost never bicomplexes .    in  [ gmstuff1 ] , we head towards applications by relating split dg @xmath0-modules to the emss .",
    "the differentials in the emss are built into the differentials of the relevant multicomplexes and they have interpretations in terms of matric massey products , as we indicate briefly .",
    "we illustrate the use of this interpretation in ",
    "[ exta ] , where we recall from @xcite that when @xmath0 is a connected algebra ( not dg algebra ) over a field @xmath1 , @xmath74 is generated under matric massey products by its elements of degree @xmath75 , which are the duals of the indecomposable elements of @xmath0 .    in  [ barsec ]",
    ", we return to the relationship between the @xmath32- and @xmath41-model structures .",
    "we show that the bar construction always gives @xmath41-cofibrant approximations . unless @xmath1 is a field , the bar construction is usually not @xmath32-cofibrant , but when @xmath0 is @xmath1-flat , for example when @xmath76 for a space @xmath6 and a commutative noetherian ring @xmath1 , bar constructions very often behave homologically as if they were @xmath32-cofibrant or at least @xmath69-cofibrant , although they are generally not .",
    "precisely , we prove that they give `` semi - flat resolutions '' under mild hypotheses .",
    "this implies that the two different definitions of differential torsion products obtained by applying homology to the tensor product derived from the @xmath32- and @xmath41-model structures agree far more often than one would expect from model categorical considerations alone .    in ",
    "[ gmstuff2 ] , which follows @xcite , we show how to start from a classical projective resolution of @xmath77 as an @xmath78-module and construct from it a `` distinguished resolution '' @xmath79 of any given dg @xmath0-module @xmath80 .",
    "this resolution is very nearly a @xmath32-cofibrant approximation : @xmath6 is @xmath32-cofibrant , and @xmath81 is a @xmath32-equivalence .",
    "however , @xmath81 need not be a degreewise epimorphism , which means that @xmath81 need not be a @xmath32-fibration .",
    "it follows that @xmath6 is @xmath31-equivalent over @xmath80 to any chosen @xmath32-cofibrant approximation @xmath82 , so there is no loss of information .",
    "the trade - off is a huge gain in calculability .",
    "we show how this works explicitly when @xmath78 is a polynomial algebra in  [ cupone ] . in turn , we show how this applies to prove in  [ topemss ] .",
    "our work displays a plethora of different types of cell objects , ranging from general types of cell objects used in our enriched and algebraic variants of the soa in  [ appendix ] to special types of cell objects used for both calculations and theoretical results in our specific category @xmath13 of dg @xmath0-modules . focusing on cellular approximations , we have two quite different special types of @xmath32-cofibrant approximations , namely _ distinguished resolutions _ , which are defined in and constructed in ",
    "[ resolve ] , and _ projective resolutions _",
    ", which are defined and constructed in  [ versustoo ] .",
    "the former are multicomplexes and the latter are bicomplexes .",
    "it is almost never the case that a resolution is both distinguished and projective , and each is used to prove things we do not know how to prove with the other .",
    "both are examples of knneth resolutions , which are defined in  [ kunndef ] and which give precisely the right generality to construct the algebraic emss but are not always @xmath32-cofibrant .",
    "we also have the bar resolution in  [ barsec ] , which always gives @xmath41-cofibrant approximations and sometimes gives @xmath32-cofibrant approximations . without exception , all of these types of dg @xmath0-modules are examples of split dg @xmath0-modules , as defined in .",
    "we are moved to offer some philosophical comments about model category theory in general . in serious applications within a subject , it is rarely if ever true that all cofibrant approximations of a given object are of equal calculational value .",
    "the most obvious example is topological spaces , where the general cell complexes given by the soa are of no particular interest and one instead works with cw complexes , or with special types of cw complexes .",
    "this is also true of spectra and much more so of @xmath18-spectra , where the calculational utility of different types of cell complexes depends heavily on both the choice of several possible quillen equivalent model categories in which to work and the choice of cell objects within the chosen category ; see @xcite and @xcite for discussion .",
    "philosophically , our theory epitomizes the virtues of model category theory , illustrating the dictum `` it is the large generalization , limited by a happy particularity , which is the fruitful conception . ''",
    "because model category theory axiomatizes structure that is already present in the categories in which one is working , it can be combined directly with those particulars that enable concrete calculations : it works within the context at hand rather than translating it to one that is chosen for purposes of greater generality and theoretical convenience , however useful that may sometimes be ( albeit rarely if ever for purposes of calculation )",
    ".    it will be clear to the experts that some of our work can be generalized from dg algebras to dg categories .",
    "we will not go into that , but we hope to return to it elsewhere .",
    "it should be clear to everyone that generalizations and analogues in other contexts must abound .",
    "model structures as in part",
    "i should appear whenever one has a category @xmath83 of structured objects enriched in a category @xmath84 with two canonical model structures ( like the @xmath31- and @xmath32-model structures on spaces and on dg @xmath1-modules ) .",
    "the category @xmath83 then has three natural notions of weak equivalences , the structure preserving homotopy equivalences ( @xmath31-equivalences ) , the homotopy equivalences of underlying objects in @xmath84 ( @xmath41-equivalences ) , and the weak equivalences of underlying objects in @xmath84 ( @xmath32-equivalences ) .",
    "these can be expected to yield @xmath32- , @xmath41- , and @xmath31-model structures with accompanying mixed @xmath65- , @xmath69- , and @xmath67-model structures .    _",

    "having completed our model theoretic work , we turn to a more calculational point of view .",
    "the theme is to give calculationally useful concrete constructions of cofibrant approximations , starting from homological algebra and different types of homological resolutions .",
    "the motivation is to understand differential homological algebra conceptually and calculationally .",
    "in fact , the pre model theoretical literature gives different definitions of differential @xmath29 and @xmath402 functors based on different kinds of resolutions , and our work gives the first proof that these definitions agree .",
    "the early definitions are given in terms of what we now recognize to be different cofibrant approximations of the same dg @xmath0-modules , and these explicit cofibrant approximations give tools for calculation .",
    "we begin with conceptual definitions of the differential @xmath29 and @xmath402 functors .",
    "of course , we define @xmath29 and @xmath402 exactly as in ( [ torext ] ) for graded @xmath1-algebras and their modules .",

    "we shall say very little more about @xmath402 here , but the parallel should be clear .    since any two @xmath32-cofibrant approximations of @xmath80 are @xmath31-equivalent over @xmath80 , we can use any @xmath32-cofibrant approximation of @xmath80 in the definition . using , we see that the functor @xmath562 preserves @xmath32-equivalences when @xmath6 is @xmath32-cofibrant .",

    "<S> the construction of some of these model structures requires two new variants of the small object argument , an enriched and an algebraic one , and we describe these more generally . in part 2 , we present a variety of theoretical and calculational cofibrant approximations in these model categories . </S>",
    "<S> the classical bar construction gives cofibrant approximations in the relative model structure , but generally not in the usual one . in the usual model structure , there are two quite different ways to lift cofibrant approximations from the level of homology modules over homology algebras , where they are classical projective resolutions , to the level of dg - modules over dg - algebras . </S>",
    "<S> the new theory makes model theoretic sense of earlier explicit calculations based on one of these constructions . </S>",
    "<S> a novel phenomenon we encounter is isomorphic cofibrant approximations with different combinatorial structure such that things proven in one avatar are not readily proven in the other .    </S>",
    "<S> overview    we aim to modernize differential homological algebra model theoretically and to exhibit several new general features of model category theory , the theme being how nicely the generalities of model category theory can interact with the calculational specificities of the subject at hand , giving concrete results inaccessible to either alone . </S>",
    "<S> this protean feature of model category theory distinguishes it from more abstract and general foundations of homotopical algebra .    </S>",
    "<S> the subject of differential homological algebra began with the hyperhomology groups of cartan and eilenberg @xcite and continued with work of eilenberg and moore @xcite in which they introduced relative homological algebra and its application to differential graded ( abbreviated dg hencefoward ) modules over a differential graded algebra . in @xcite , they developed the eilenberg - moore spectral sequence for the computation of the cohomology @xmath2 in terms of differential torsion products , where @xmath3 is the pullback in a diagram @xmath4   \\ar[d ] & e \\ar[d]^p\\\\ a \\ar[r ] &   b\\\\}\\ ] ] in which @xmath5 is a fibration . </S>",
    "<S> this work dates from the mid 1960 s , and it all works with bigraded chain bicomplexes @xmath6 : @xmath7 is a bigraded @xmath1-module with commuting horizontal and vertical differentials and a total differential given by their sum ( with suitable signs ) .    in the early 1970 s , gugenheim and may @xcite gave an ad hoc alternative treatment of differential homological algebra that was based on bigraded multicomplexes @xmath6 : now @xmath8 is the sum over @xmath9 of partial differentials @xmath10 , @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> bicomplexes are the special case with @xmath11 for @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of the generalization was computability , as the cited papers show and we will illustrate shortly . while the applications worked , the foundations were so obscure that it was not even clear that the several definitions of differential torsion products in sight agreed .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper has several distinct purposes . </S>",
    "<S> the primary purpose is to establish model theoretic foundations for differential homological algebra over a commutative ground ring @xmath1 and to integrate the early work into the modern foundations . </S>",
    "<S> specialization to a field @xmath1 simplifies the theory , but the force of the early applications depends on working more generally . then relative homological algebra enters the picture : for dg modules over a dg @xmath1-algebra @xmath0 , there are three natural choices for the weak equivalences : quasi - isomorphism , homotopy equivalence of underlying dg @xmath1-modules , and homotopy equivalence of dg @xmath0-modules . </S>",
    "<S> we shall explain six related model category structures on the category @xmath13 of dg @xmath0-modules , one or more for each of these choices .    here a second purpose enters . some of these model structures can not be constructed using previously known techniques . </S>",
    "<S> we develop new enriched and algebraic versions of the classical small object argument that allow the construction of model category structures that are definitely not cofibrantly generated in the classical sense . </S>",
    "<S> the classical bar construction always gives cofibrant approximations in one of these new relative model structures , but not in the model structure in ( implicit ) common use . </S>",
    "<S> the model category foundations are explained generally , since they will surely have other applications .    </S>",
    "<S> the model categorical cell complexes that underpin our model structures are given by multicomplexes , not bicomplexes , and a third purpose is to explain the interplay between the several kinds of resolutions in early work and our model structures . in particular , we show that the `` distinguished resolutions '' of @xcite are essentially model categorical cofibrant approximations . </S>",
    "<S> our work in this paper is largely model theoretic but , as we explain in  [ topemss ] , the applications in @xcite show that it applies _ directly _ to concrete explicit calculations . </S>",
    "<S> here is an example whose statement makes no reference to model categorical machinery .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath14 be a compact lie group with maximal torus @xmath15 such that @xmath16 is a free @xmath17-module and let @xmath18 be a connected topological group such that @xmath19 is a polynomial algebra . </S>",
    "<S> then for any map @xmath20 , @xmath21    here @xmath17 is an @xmath19-module via @xmath22 . </S>",
