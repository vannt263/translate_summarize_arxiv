    "ionized calcium ( ca@xmath0 ) not only represents the most common signal transduction element relaying information within cells to control a wide array of activities including secretion , contraction and cell proliferation , but also is invariably involved in cell death ( berridge , 1997 ) . to coordinate all of these functions , cytosolic",
    "ca@xmath0 needs to be precisely regulated in space , time and amplitude .",
    "normal concentrations of cytosolic ca@xmath0 ( [ ca@xmath0 ] @xmath5 100 nm ) is 20000 fold lower than the 2 mm concentration found extracellularly . under resting conditions this gradient",
    "is maintained by active extrusion of cytosolic ca@xmath0 by ca@xmath0atpases present in the plasma membrane and in the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) , or in the sarcoplasmic reticulum in electrically excitable cells .",
    "these pumps counterbalance the leak of ca@xmath0 into the cytosol from both the extracellular space and the er ca@xmath0 store .",
    "a wide variety of extracellular stimuli cause the increase of [ ca@xmath0 ] to exert their effect . in non - excitable cells ,",
    "this increase is triggered by inositol(1,4,5)-trisphosphate ( ip@xmath1 ) , produced upon activation of phospholipase c ( berridge , 1997 ) .",
    "ip@xmath1 rapidly diffuses into the cytosol , where it interacts with the inositol(1,4,5)-triphosphate receptors ( ip@xmath1r ) , to promote the release of ca@xmath0 into the cytosol . depending on the cell type",
    ", the resulting cytosolic ca@xmath0 signal can have a complex spatio - temporal composition ( berridge , 1997 ) .",
    "it is generally recognized that , in the presence of a constant external stimulus , the ca@xmath0 displays spiking behavior .",
    "these ca@xmath0 oscillations can be spatially localized or extended , spreading as a wave throughout the entire cell .",
    "the process of ca@xmath0 released from the er through channels is nonlinear since , increased ca@xmath0 concentration in the cytosol favors channel opening .",
    "this autocatalytic amplification is called calcium - induced calcium release ( cicr ) .",
    "there are a variety of channels showing cicr .",
    "ca@xmath0 release is terminated by closure of the channels at high ca@xmath0 levels , after which ca@xmath0 is removed from the cytosol by the action of the ca@xmath0 atpases .",
    "it has been observed that ca@xmath0 release channels are spatially organized in clusters .",
    "single release channel , named ca@xmath0 blips , has been observed in experiments ( bootman et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "collective opening and closing of several ca@xmath0 channels in a cluster , named puffs , have also been observed in experiments ( callamaras et al . , 1998 ) . that suggests a hierarchy of calcium signaling events from small blips to large puffs ( lipp and niggli , 1998 ; bootman et al . , 1997 ) . improved spatial and temporal resolution in recording reveal that there is not a clear distinction between fundamental blips and elementary puffs .",
    "channels open and close in a stochastic way .",
    "ca@xmath0 release by one channel increase the open probability for the neighboring channels .",
    "thus at high levels of ip@xmath1 , neighboring clusters become functionally coupled by ca@xmath0 diffusion and cicr support the formation of spatiotemporal patterns of intracellular ca@xmath0 release .",
    "watras et al .",
    "( 1991 ) found that ca@xmath0 channels in the cerebellum exhibits four conductance levels that are multiples of a unit conductance step .",
    "this observation suggests that the number of interacting receptors in one complex can vary from one to four and supports the hypothesis that the channel is a tetramer .",
    "examination of the ip@xmath1 dependence of channel , yielded hill coefficients of 1 - 1.3 ( watras et al . , 1991 ) .",
    "however , in hepatocytes the response to ip@xmath1 are positively cooperative with a hill coefficient of 3.0 - 3.4 ( marchant and taylor , 1997 ; dufour et al . , 1997 ) or .",
    "in our numerical simulation we found that the hill coefficient increase from 1.15 to 2.2 when total ca@xmath0 ( cytosolic + stored ) level increase .",
    "however , the model is not able to explain higher values of @xmath6 as that reported by marchant and taylor ( 1997 ) . this finding suggest that feedback from cytosolic ca@xmath0 plays a key role in the channel response to ip@xmath1 , but is not able to explain high hill coefficients found in some tissues .",
    "experimental finding of bezprozvanny et al .",
    "( 1991 ) clear up several aspects of the kinetic of the receptors .",
    "thus several models for ca@xmath0 dynamics in systems involving ip@xmath1r have been proposed ( de young and keizer , 1992 ; othmer and tang , 1993 ; bezprozvanny and ehrlich , 1994 ) .",
    "these models of ip@xmath1r assume a regulatory site for ip@xmath1 on the channel complex , one activating site and one inhibiting site for ca@xmath0 .",
    "experimental findings suggest that the channel is open when ip@xmath1 ion is bound to its corresponding domain and ca@xmath0 is bound to its activating domain and not bound to its inhibiting site . in the aforementioned models , ca@xmath0 binding to the activating regulatory site is a fast process compared with that of inhibiting binding and all these models reproduce a bell - shaped curve when one plots the fraction of open channels as a function of @xmath7[ca@xmath0 ] .    de young and keizer model ( dkm ) for ip@xmath1r assumes that the ligands can bind to any unoccupied site on the ip@xmath1r independently of the binding status of the other sites , which leads to eight possible states of the receptor ( de young and keizer , 1992 ) . a more general scheme is to assume state - dependent binding to each site . in this framework ,",
    "the simplest model was developed by othmer and tang ( 1993 ) which assumes that the binding order of ions and molecules to the receptor is not free . in the othmer - tang model ( otm )",
    "it is assumed that the binding process is sequential ( othmer and tang , 1993 ) .",
    "ca@xmath0 binds to the activating site on the receptor only after ip@xmath1 has bound , and that the binding of calcium to inhibitory site occurs only after calcium is bound to the activating site .",
    "this sequential binding leads to four possible states for the receptor . bezprozvanny and ehrlich ( 1994 ) proposed a variation to the otm which incorporates an additional closed state corresponding to activating site occupied which decay rapidly to the open state .",
    "the bindings of ip@xmath1 and ca@xmath0 to the regulatory sites are stochastic events rendering the opening and closing of the channel a stochastic process .",
    "the small number of calcium channels in a cluster indicates that deterministic models might be insufficient .",
    "in fact , abortive waves can not be understood in terms of deterministic models , since in these models an excitation travels steadily if it travels at all .",
    "the stochastic effects are relevant for modeling ca@xmath0 wave propagation .",
    "furthermore , the observation of localized stochastic ca@xmath0 puffs and the rather small number of channels creating the localized event , suggest that it is mandatory take into account the binding processes as stochastic events .",
    "the stochastic dynamics of clustered ip@xmath1r has been studied by swillens et al .",
    "( 1999 ) which model has 14 states .",
    "there are also several studies considering stochastic dynamics focusing on the onset of the saltatory propagation of calcium waves due to intercluster diffusion of ca@xmath0 ( keizer et al .",
    ", 1998 ; falcke et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "shuai and jung ( 2002b ) have been study the statistical properties of ca@xmath0 release in a stochastic and simplified version of the dkm .    in this paper",
    "we regard a markov - stochastic version of the otm to study the stochastic properties of the calcium release of ip@xmath1r clusters .",
    "we decided to stick to the othmer and tang approach because the otm has the least number of channel states and kinetic parameters , yet it adequately explains the experimentally observed channel kinetics . after a brief description of the model in section 2 ,",
    "we discuss the role of cytosolic calcium and ip@xmath1 in regulating the fraction of open channels .",
    "we show that the fraction of open channels versus ip@xmath1 concentration fit a hill curve which coefficient increase with the average intracellular calcium concentration .",
    "the amplitude , inter - puff interval ( ipi ) and size distribution of calcium puffs are also discussed .",
    "finally , we show that there are no correlation between two consecutive ipis , but there are some correlation between the puff duration and the puff amplitude .",
    "in the othmer and tang model there is only one subunit / receptor in a each channel .",
    "the three binding sites on the receptor and the sequential binding scheme allows four different states for the receptor x@xmath8 .",
    "the index @xmath9 stands for the ip@xmath1 site , @xmath10 for the activating ca@xmath0 site , and @xmath11 for the inhibiting ca@xmath0 .",
    "an index is 1 if an ion is bound and 0 if not .",

    "the channel is only conductive when the receptor is in the state @xmath15 .",
    "the channels are assumed to be close enough so that ca@xmath0 concentrations can be considered homogeneous throughout the cluster .",
    "we neglect ca@xmath0 diffusion between cluster and environment without accounting for spatial aspects of formation and collapse of ca@xmath0 waves",
    ". we will not consider calcium transport across the plasma membrane .",
    "thus the ca@xmath0 simply flow or is pumped back and forth between the er and the cytoplasm , and the total intracellular calcium concentration is constant .",

    "@xmath25 is the basal permeability of the er membrane in the absence of ip@xmath1 . for the study of ca@xmath0 dynamics in many cell types ,",
    "ca@xmath0 exchange with the extracellular medium is much smaller than the ca@xmath0 flux across the er membrane ( koster et al . , 1993 ; thastrup , 1990 ) .",
    "for this reason , eqs .",
    "( 1 - 2 ) can be simplified by using the volume average intracellular calcium concentration [ ca@xmath0]@xmath26([ca@xmath0]@xmath27 [ ca@xmath0]@xmath28)@xmath29 .",

    "we have developed a stochastic version of the othmer - tang model to study dynamical and statistical properties of ca@xmath0 release of clusters of ip@xmath1-sensitive receptors . in comparison to others stochastic models ( falcke et al .",
    ", 2000 ; br et al . , 2000 ; swillens et al . , 1999 ) , our receptor model is simpler and is represented by only four states . in this stochastic clustered ip@xmath1r model , the ca@xmath0 diffusion between the cluster and the environment is ignored so that an isolated cluster can be discussed .",
    "however , the channels are assumed to be close enough and the instantaneous ca@xmath0 diffusion within a cluster is so fast that the calcium concentration within a cluster is always homogeneous .",
    "we found that the model reproduce experimental result by watras et al .",
    "( 1991 ) where it is shown that the channel response to the ip@xmath1 follow a hill curve . in intact cells , the long latency and subsequent sigmoidal increase in cytosolic [ ca@xmath0 ] after addition of agonists ( berridge , 1997 ) , are consistent with either positively cooperative activation of ip@xmath1rs by ip@xmath1 alone or by feedback from cytosolic [ ca@xmath0 ] .",
    "distinguishing between these mechanisms , however , is difficult in intact cells , in which ip@xmath1 receptor activation inevitably increases cytosolic [ ca@xmath0 ] . in broken cells , the use of fluorescent indicators to measure rapid rates of ca@xmath0 efflux is prone to similar difficulties .",
    "results from a variety of tissues using superfusion ( finch et al . , 1991 ) ,",
    "bilayer recording ( watras et al . , 1991 ; besprozvanny et al . ,",
    "1991 ) , fluorescent indicators ( champeil et al . , 1989 ) or flash photolysis of caged ip@xmath1 in intact cells ( parker et al . , 1996 ) suggest that responses to ip@xmath1 are either not positively cooperative ( finch et al .",
    ", 1991 ; parker et al . , 1996 ; watras et al . , 1991 ) or only slightly so ( besprozvanny et al . , 1991 ; champeil et al . ,",
    "each approach has its limitations and together the results provide no clear indication of whether responses to ip@xmath1 are positively cooperative in the absence of positive feedback from cytosolic ca@xmath0 . in our numerical simulation",
    "we found that , even in absence of cooperativity in the model , the hill coefficient increase from 1.15 to 2.2 when [ ca@xmath0]@xmath30 increase .",
    "however , the model is not able to explain higher values of @xmath6 as that reported by marchant and taylor ( 1997 ) .",
    "this results suggest that feedback from cytosolic ca@xmath0 plays a key role in the channel response to ip@xmath1 , but to explain high values of @xmath6 found in some tissues , a cooperative mechanism could be mandatory .    other important aspect is the frequency encoding .",
    "it is well known that ip@xmath1 stimuli evoke repetitive spikes in the intracellular ca@xmath0 concentration rather than simply elevating the level of ca@xmath0 .",
    "moreover , when the [ ip@xmath1 ] is increased , the mean frequency of spiking raises , but the amplitude remains essentially constant .",
    "thus a continuous level of stimuli signal is converted into a frequency - encoded signal : the number of spikes per time unit ( tang and othmer , 1995 ) .",
    "a common problem found in this kind of converter devices is the competition between two desirable goals : i ) high sensitivity , the system ideally should be able to detect even weak signals ; and ii ) large dynamic range , the system should not saturate over various orders of magnitude of input intensity .",
    "for this reason the hill coefficient ( when the response is well - fitted by a hill curve ) its desirable to be less than 1 . in the results derived from our numerical simulation , we can observe that the mean frequency of the spiking behavior in response to the ip@xmath1 stimuli is well characterized by hill curves .",
    "the hill coefficient , between 1.8 - 2.1 , was essentially independent of [ ca@xmath0]@xmath30 .",
    "this value is too high given narrow dynamical range in order to frequency - encode the ip@xmath1 signal .",
    "however , this narrow dynamical range observed in isolated cluster , could be translates into a wider dynamical range as result of the collective phenomenon by considering an intercluster communication mechanism .",
    "this interesting discussion is the subject of our current research and will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the small number of the ip@xmath1rs in a cluster introduce stochastic oscillation into the calcium release dynamics .",
    "experimental data suggest that the localized calcium release varies in a continuous fashion due to stochastic variation in both numbers of channels recruited and durations of channel openings .",
    "it is not obvious which aspects of ca@xmath0 puffs are originally determined by the dynamics of the ca@xmath0 channels , which properties are determined by the diffusion and ca@xmath0 binding kinetics , and which properties are induced from the measurement procedures ( cheng et al . , 1999 ; izu et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "although in several experiments one - peak amplitude distributions were observed , cheng et al . , ( 1999 ) suggested that the original calcium puffs should have an exponential decaying decreasing amplitude distribution .",
    "our stochastic simulations shown that the amplitude distributions varies in a continuous fashion from exponential decay to two - peak distributions . even for a small threshold ( as 0.20 @xmath54 m ) a peak is observed in the amplitude distributions for high values both of [ ip@xmath1 ] and [ ca@xmath0]@xmath30 .",
    "however , the puffs size ( i.e. amplitude @xmath68 duration ) distributions have essentially an exponential decay distribution over the range studied here .",
    "these results indicate that a fixed puff morphology which is sometimes assumed in literature ( pratusevich and balke , 1996 ; izu et al . , 1998 ; cheng et al . , 1999 )",
    "is not a good assumption for ca@xmath0 puff analysis .",
    "furthermore , in our markovian simulation , we found that the amplitude of puff is correlated with its duration in agreement with experimental observation reported by thomas et al . , ( 1998 ) .    other useful way to characterize the calcium puffs dynamics is using the ipi distributions .",
    "the stochastic simulation of the otm shown that the ipi distributions varies from exponential decay to a skewed bell - shape distributions .",
    "for physiological values of ip@xmath1 and [ ca@xmath0]@xmath30 the distributions have a maximum around 1.5 seconds . the shape is consistent with distribution observed by marchant et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , however , the typical ipi observed in the experiment , around 2.5 seconds , was slightly higher .",
    "in contrast to the deterministic models , we shown that two consecutive ipi are not correlated .",
    "for this reason , the random spiking behavior or stochastic oscillations have an essentially different nature that the periodic oscillations generated by deterministic models .",
    "we want to remark that the stochastic oscillations are different from the stochastic excitability discussed by keizer and smith ( 1998 ) . for the stochastic excitability , once [ ca@xmath0 ] randomly becomes larger than a threshold , a fast release ( action - potential - like ) of [ ca@xmath0 ] followed by a refractory period can be observed . for the stochastic oscillation studied here",
    "there is not such a threshold .",
    "more broad distributions of puff amplitudes and ipi are yielded for stochastic oscillation .",
