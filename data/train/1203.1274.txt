    "their qualitative dynamical properties are extremely non - local !",
    "this global influence on the dynamics translates into several intriguing _ rigidity phenomena _ , which are at the basis of many unanswered questions and conjectures .",
    "+      the starting point of this work is the following question attributed to victor guillemin :    [ q1 ] _ let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be smooth birkhoff billiard maps corresponding to two strictly convex domains @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "assume that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are conjugate , i.e there exists @xmath9 such that @xmath10 .",
    "what can we say about the two domains @xmath7 and @xmath8 ? are they `` similar '' , that is , have they the same shape ? _",
    "+    to our knowledge the only known answer to this question is in the case of circular billiards . a billiard map in a disc @xmath11 , in fact , enjoys the peculiar property of having the phase space completely foliated by homotopically non - trivial invariant curves .",
    "it is an example of so - called _",
    "integrable billiards_. in terms of the geometry of the billiard domain @xmath11 , this reflects the existence of a smooth foliation by ( smooth and convex)_caustics _ , _ i.e. _ ( smooth and convex ) curves with the property that if a trajectory is tangent to one of them , then it will remain tangent after each reflection .",
    "it is easy to check that in the circular billiard case this family consists of concentric circles ( figure [ circle - billiard ] ) .",
    "see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 2 ) .",
    "+    [ h ! ]        in @xcite , misha bialy proved the following beautiful result : + * theorem ( bialy ) . * _ if the phase space of the billiard ball map is foliated by continuous invariant curves which are not null - homotopic , then it is a circular billiard . _",
    "+ since having such a foliation is invariant under conjugacy , then question [ q1 ] has an affirmative answer if one of the two domains is a circle .",
    "+ in this article we want to deal with a much weaker assumption :    [ q2 ] _ what happens if we assume that the two billiard maps are conjugate * only * in a neighborhood of the boundary _ ?",
    "our interest in this variant of question [ q1 ] comes from the following observation .",
    "circular billiards are not the only examples of integrable billiards . although there is no commonly agreed definition , this can be understood either as the existence of an _ integral of motion _ or as the presence of a ( smooth ) family of caustics that foliate a neighborhood of the boundary ( the equivalence of this two notions is an interesting problem itself ) .",
    "billiards in ellipses , therefore , are also integrable .",
    "yet , the dynamical picture is very distinct from the circular case : as it is showed in figure [ ellipse - billiard ] , each trajectory which does not pass through a focal point , is always tangent to precisely one confocal conic section , either a confocal ellipse or the two branches of a confocal hyperbola ( see for example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 ) ) .",
    "thus , the confocal ellipses inside an elliptical billiards are convex caustics , but they do not foliate the whole domain : the segment between the two foci is left out .",
    "+ hence , while it is clear from bialy s result that a global conjugacy between the billiard maps in a non - circular ellipse and a circle can not exist , it is everything but obvious whether a _ local _ conjugacy near the boundary exists or does not .",

    "+    [ h ! ]        in this article we prove the following result . + * main theorem ( theorem [ maintheorem ] ) .",
    "* _ let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be billiard maps corresponding , respectively , to strictly convex @xmath12 planar domains @xmath13 and @xmath14 , with @xmath15 .",

    "i.e. _ there exists @xmath16 such that @xmath17 for any @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",

    "furthermore , as we discuss in appendix [ extension ] , it is sufficient to have a @xmath1 conjugacy @xmath9 _ only _ on an invariant cantor set which includes the boundary .",
    "this invariant cantor set , for instance , could consist of invariant curves ( caustics ) accumulating to the boundary . in the case of smooth strictly convex billiards",
    ", the existence of such invariant curves follows from a famous result of lazutkin @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "observe that if we assumed @xmath9 to be only continuous , then the answer to the above questions would be negative .",
    "in fact , as pointed out to us by john mather , billiards in ellipses of different eccentricities can not be globally @xmath20conjugate , due to dynamics at the elliptic periodic points .",
    "this provides a negative answer to question [ q1 ] .",
    "as for question [ q2 ] , we can prove the following : + * proposition [ c0conjugacy ] *    _ let @xmath21 be the circle and @xmath14 be an ellipse of non - zero eccentricity .",

    "similary , if @xmath13 and @xmath14 are ellipses of different eccentricities , then their billiard maps are @xmath20-conjugate near the boundary .",
    "+      let us now discuss the implications of our result to a famous conjecture attributed to birkhoff .",

    "as far as our understanding of integrable billiards is concerned , the two most important related results are the above  mentioned theorem by bialy @xcite and a theorem by mather @xcite which proves the non - existence of caustics if the curvature of the boundary vanishes at one point .",
    "this latter justifies the restriction of our attention to strictly convex domains .",

    "a circle ) . _ +    in the light of remark [ rem1 ] ( see also corollary [ main - corollary ] ) , it would suffice to have such a conjugacy only on a cantor set of caustics which includes the boundary .",
    "observe that it follows from lazutkin s result @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that such a conjugacy always exists on a cantor set of caustics that accumulates on the boundary , but does not include it ( see theorem [ kovachev - popov ] ) .    the problem becomes understanding when this conjugacy can be extended up to the boundary and what is its smoothness ( in whitney s sense ) .",

    "+    [ conj ] _ let @xmath22 be a smooth integrable billiard domain and let @xmath23 be an ellipse with the same perimeter and the same lazutkin perimeter ( see section [ sec2 ] ) .",

    "+      finally , we would like to describe how our result is related to a classical spectral problem : _ can one hear the shape of a drum ? _ , as formulated in a very suggestive way by m. kac @xcite . in the context of billiards ( which can be considered as limit geodesic flow ) , this question becomes : what information on the geometry of the billiard domain are encoded in the length spectrum of its closed orbits ?",
