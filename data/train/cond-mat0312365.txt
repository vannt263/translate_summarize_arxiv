    "similarly , the largest non - oscillating cl belongs only to the spin and orbital correlator whereas the second largest appears only in the asymptotic expansion of the mixed correlator .",
    "the numerical data indicate that all cls apart from the dimer cl stay finite as @xmath139 which is expected for a system with a gap .",
    "in summary , we have used the tmrg method to study thermodynamic properties of a spin-@xmath187 @xmath5 spin - orbital model . we have concentrated on three representative points in the phase diagram : ( 1 ) the @xmath0 symmetric point where the model is bethe - ansatz integrable and shows critical properties at @xmath17 , ( 2 ) a point where the model still exhibits critical behavior at zero temperature , however , the symmetry is reduced to @xmath5 , and ( 3 ) a point where the ground state has long range dimer order .    in the first two cases",
    "we have compared our numerical results in detail with cft in the low temperature regime and with special attention to the evolution of various cls with temperature . in both cases three different regimes",
    "could be identified : at elevated temperatures crossovers between different cls are frequent and the corresponding wave vectors are commensurate .",
    "the @xmath85-oscillating cls belonging to the spin , orbital or mixed spin - orbital correlator merge at a certain temperature with a square root singularity and the oscillations become incommensurate and temperature dependent below which characterizes the intermediate temperature regime .",
    "finally , at low temperatures the conformal invariant regime is reached where the cls belonging to critical excitations diverge as @xmath76 up to logarithmic corrections and no crossover occur .",
    "the comparison of the numerics with cft was especially simple at the @xmath0 point because the velocities of the elementary excitations are known exactly from bethe ansatz.@xcite in this case we have also been able to show that the predicted logarithmic corrections@xcite account quantitatively for the observed deviations from a pure @xmath188 behavior at low temperatures . in the second case a comparison with cft was far more complicated as the velocities @xmath131 , @xmath132",
    "are a priori unknown and several crossovers in the lowest numerically accessible temperature region show that the conformal invariant regime was not reached .",
    "however , we have been able to get rough estimates for the spin and orbital velocities from the cls and have shown that these estimates give a consistent description of other thermodynamic quantities within cft .    for the point in the dimerized phase we have calculated the gap from the susceptibility and entropy data and have found good agreement with a recent series expansion study.@xcite more important",
    ", we have found that the behavior of cls in the high and intermediate temperature regime here is quite similar to the gapless phase . at low temperatures",
    "a dimer cl diverges more strongly than @xmath76 whereas all other cls stay finite as is expected for a system with long range dimer order at @xmath17 .",
    "most surprisingly we find in all 3 cases a strong tendency towards dimerization in a certain finite temperature interval and dimerization could be the leading instability in this region even if the ground state is not dimerized .",
    "this behavior is very similar to what was observed recently in another spin - orbital model with spin @xmath189@xcite indicating that such instability may be an intrinsic property of these kind of kugel - khomskii hamiltonians . in a system of",
    "weakly coupled spin - orbital chains this instability may turn into true long range dimer order at finite temperature .",
    "more generally speaking , it indicates that even a pure electronic model may show various temperature driven phase transitions between different spin and orbital orderings due to the large number of nearly degenerated states accessible to systems with unquenched orbital degrees of freedom .",
