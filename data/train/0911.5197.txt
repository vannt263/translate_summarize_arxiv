    "ge : ga photoconductor detector is a highly sensitive infrared detector that has been used for many astronomical applications including iras @xcite , irts ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) , iso ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) , akari ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) , spitzer @xcite , and herschel @xcite .    for the akari satellite , we have developed the world s first two - dimensional monolithic ge : ga photoconductor array , achieving a large array format of @xmath5 pixels with the pixel size of @xmath6 @xmath1m@xmath7 ( figure  [ doiy2_fig : akari_sw ] ) .",
    "pixel ge : ga monolithic array module onboard akari .",
    "two sets of array are used for two photometric bands .",
    "top - left figure shows a sectional view of the detector ( see text for the detailed descriptions).,width=9 ]    the ge : ga photoconductor is produced by doping a 0.5-mm - thick ge wafer with ga concentration of @xmath8 @xmath9 . for longitudinal configuration ( top illumination ) , a transparent contact with a grid - shape metal electrode is fabricated on the top surface of the ge : ga wafer ( also see @xmath10[doiy2_sec : transparent ] ) .",
    "ohmic contact of the electrode is formed by b@xmath11 ion implantation on top and bottom surfaces of the wafer .",
    "bias voltage is applied to the whole array in common from the top contact .",
    "the bottom contact of each array pixel is directly connected to each cre element with a 100-@xmath1m - diameter indium ball .",
    "the array pixels are electrically separated each other by 50-@xmath1m - wide , 30-@xmath1m - deep grid - shape ditches on the back surface .",
    "the infrared light incident from the top surface travels between the top and bottom surfaces back and forth , due to high reflectivity of the non - ar - coated top ge surface and the metal back surface .",
    "thanks to the multiple reflections , long absorption length is obtained without any external optics like an optical cavity , and the resultant quantum efficiency is approximately 0.4 , which corresponds to the responsivity at an optimum bias of @xmath12 a / w . however , the multiple reflections cause interference fringes and result in the presence of periodic peaks in the spectral response , which is a serious drawback of this device especially for spectroscopic applications . mitigating this fringe problem by the anti - reflection ( ar )",
    "coating is an issue of new array development ( see @xmath10[doiy2_sec : ar ] ) .",
    "the arrays are attached to a fan - out board made of quartz substrate , and the fan - out board is mounted on a rigid frame made of gold - coated kovar .",
    "these materials are chosen to minimize the thermal stress to the detector .",
    "the kovar frame is mounted on the aluminium housing with thermal isolation legs made of vespel sp-1 and is thermally connected to the helium tank by a copper strap .",
    "the detector temperature is controlled to @xmath13 k by self - heat dissipation of the cre ( @xmath14 mw ) and additional heater power .",
    "the total mass of the detector module is @xmath15 g. the flight model detector module passes the vibration test for simulating the mechanical stress at the launch .",
    "the proposed design of monolithic array for safari is a natural extension of the akari detector with minimum modification of fabrication technology . we plan to make a @xmath0 mosaic array with four segments of @xmath16 array , which can be surely fabricated by using the same technology for the akari detector .",
    "the pixel size of the safari detector will be 500 @xmath17 500 @xmath1m@xmath7 , and the thickness will be 500 @xmath1 m . as shown in figure  [ doiy2_fig : test_array ] , we have already fabricated @xmath16 test arrays to make proof of the au - in bump technology .",
    "the test array consists of a pure ge substrate and a si board with @xmath16 bumping pads with pixel pitch of 500 @xmath1 m , simulating the monolithic ge : ga array bumped on cre .",
    "we have checked the connection of the au - in bumps of all pixels before and after thermal cycles between the room and lhe temperatures , by simple resistance measurements of the daisy chain electrodes . for the initial test",
    ", we prepared a device with the indium balls smaller than that for the akari detector , to find out a minimum amount of indium for the bump . as a result ,",
    "the connection became failed at some pixels ( @xmath12% ) after thermal cycles .",
    "hence , we are fabricating another test device with larger indium balls similar to the akari detector .",
    "this device will be tested by the end of this year ( 2009 ) .",

    "a transparent contact is fabricated on the top surface of the ge : ga detector wafer by b@xmath11 ion implantation ( see @xmath10[doiy2_sec : monolithic ] ) .",
    "investigation of the optimum implantation density is another development item for the safari detector as it may cause additional absorption and/or reflection .    for that purpose ,",
    "we have tested three parameters including @xmath18}$ ] , which are 1/2 , 1 , and 2 times of the implantation for the akari detector @xcite . a figure of test pieces for the resistivity measurement",
    "is shown in figure  [ doiy2_fig : tlm_photo ] and the results are shown in figure  [ doiy2_fig : tlm ] .",
    "we found reasonably small resistivity ( @xmath19}$ ] ) for all the parameters with a linear dependence for the implantation density ( figure  [ doiy2_fig : tlm ] ) .",
    "we also measure the optical transmittance of the contacts and the results are shown in figure  [ doiy2_fig : contact_trans ] .    }",

    "all the substrates are 500 @xmath1 m in thickness .",
    "measurements are done under 4.2 [ k].,width=7 ]    transmittance of 0.2  0.4 are measured for all the transparent contacts on ge : ga wafers with some dependence upon the implantation density .",
    "these transmittance are significantly smaller than that of the pure ge wafer shown in figure  [ doiy2_fig : contact_trans ] and the degradations can not be fully attributed to ga and b free careers in ge : ga substrate and the contacts at the lhe temperature .",
    "part of the degradation could possibly be due to metallization of the contact .",
    "we plan to make further investigations to find out the optimum parameters for the contact fabrication .",
    "in order to avoid the interference fringe problem described in @xmath10[doiy2_sec : monolithic ] , top surface of the monolithic array for safari is ar - coated by si / sio2 multi - layer coatings . even if the optical path length inside ge :",
    "ga is decreased by the ar - coatings , the mean optical efficiency of the coated device , taking the reflection loss at the initial surface into account , can be higher than that without coatings .    we have already made samples of the ar - coatings for transmission measurements and the results are shown in figure  [ doiy2_fig : ar ] .",
    "the initial trial of the process was a single layer @xmath21 on a ge wafer , and we could successfully demonstrate that the interference fringes around the center wavelength disappear and that the transmittance showed good agreement with the theoretical calculation .",
    "as the next step , a sample of three layer coatings ( @xmath22 ) was made to demonstrate the broad - band ar coatings , and its broad band property was measured . although the minimum reflectance of the three - layer coatings was much larger than that of the single layer and the transmittance showed considerable amount of residual interference fringes around the center wavelength , the effective bandwidth of the reduced reflectance was much wider than that of the single layer .",
    "comparison of the data with theoretical calculation is currently in progress and we plan to make further development of the ar - coating with design refinement as well as increased number of layers .",
    "we have also fabricated the ar - coatings on single element ge : ga chips and on the @xmath23 prototype arrays , and we will demonstrate the improved properties of these devices in near future .     coating .",

    "in order to demonstrate the properties of the monolithic array , we have fabricated a prototype ge : ga array of @xmath23 pixels bumped to a cryogenic ctia readout circuit with a @xmath23 multiplexer .",
    "for the first trial fabrication , commercially purchased ge : ga material is used .",
    "the device mounted on a chip carrier with pin grid array ( pga ) is shown in figure  [ doiy2_fig:5x5 ] .",
    "prototype array mounted on a chip carrier with pga to demonstrate the properties of the monolithic array.,width=9 ]    structure of the flight model array will be basically the same as this device except for the array size .",
    "the ic pins of the chip carrier are connected to a socket of a fan - out board for interfacing to the back stage .",
    "a preliminary operation test has been carried out and the results are shown in figures  [ doiy2_fig : ramp ] and [ doiy2_fig : photo_current ] .",
    ".,width=6 ]    figure  [ doiy2_fig : ramp ] demonstrates an example signal output of a pixel illuminated by low - temperature black - body light installed in a test cryostat .",
    "photo - current integrated in a capacitor together with periodical reset of the integrated electrical charge results in a saw - like ramp signal .",
    "currently environmental emc noise dominates the output noise performance so that a modification of the test environment is required .",
    "pixels and its dependence to the bias voltage.,width=6 ]    figure  [ doiy2_fig : photo_current ] shows the measured responsivity of each pixel in the @xmath23 array and its dependence on the applied bias voltage .",
    "an average responsivity of @xmath24 [ a / w ] with 30% variation is found with a bias voltage of 100 [ mv ] .",
    "this responsivity is somewhat lower than that has been achieved for the akari array ( @xmath10[doiy2_sec : monolithic ] ) .",
    "at the same time , a periodical variation pattern across the array is found .",
    "we will make further investigations on the detector performances with optimising contact process parameters as well as changing detector material to the ge : ga crystal that was used for akari flight module .",
    "we are developing a @xmath25 ge : ga array as a candidate detector array for safari .",
    "for that purpose , we are aiming to demonstrate the feasibility of all the elemental technologies that are required for fabricating a ge : ga array by mid 2010 ( figure  [ doiy2_fig : timeline ] ) .",
    "now we start testing a prototype @xmath26 array and plan to demonstrate fundamental detector performances including responsivity and noise performance with an improved test environment .",
    "another trial fabrication of @xmath26 arrays is ongoing and an array with akari material as well as ar coated detector are to be fabricated . with these devices",
    ", we plan to measure the best performance that can be achieved with the current cold readout electronics .",
    "mitigation of fringe problem ( @xmath10[doiy2_sec : monolithic ] ) , including fringes in spectral response as well as an optical cross - talk , is another issue to be tested with the new device with ar coating .",
    "indium bumping with larger indium balls ( @xmath10[doiy2_sec : new_array ] ) is planned to achieve @xmath27 direct bumping .",
    "ar coating will also be developed with design refinement and increased number of layers ( @xmath10[doiy2_sec : ar ] ) .",
