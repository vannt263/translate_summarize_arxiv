    "uncertainty relation ( ur ) has played a fundamentally crucial role in characterizing quantum mechanics ever since its birth .",
    "ur can also be employed as a pivotal tool in quantum information tasks , e.g. entanglement detection . in particular , tests adopting matrices of moments ( mms ) together with negativity of partial transposition ( npt )",
    "have been broadly used @xcite .",
    "the principle behind such tests is that the negativity of the partially transposed density matrix of an entangled state also induces the negativity of its mm . as a matter of fact ,",
    "provided that an infinite hierarchy is allowed , the converse is also true @xcite , that is , if the mm of a partially transposed density matrix is negative then the state is npt entangled .",
    "criteria utilizing mm and npt are particularly useful for continuous - variable ( cv ) states . for the discrete variable case ,",
    "numerous measures and detection schemes for entanglement are well developed , which , however , is more challenging for the cv case except very special ones .",
    "this is because the hilbert space of cv is infinite dimensional and thereby can have a more involved structure .    in this respect ,",
    "simon essentially derived a second - order mm for an inseparability criterion @xcite , which is a necessary and sufficient condition for gaussian states .",
    "duan also proposed a complete criterion based on mm for gaussian states @xcite although it does not seem to be directly connected to npt .",
    "an entangled gaussian state does not need any higher - order mm to detect its inseparability .",
    "since then , a number of other criteria have also been developed in order to address also non - gaussian entangled states @xcite .",
    "of these criteria , shchukin and vogel ( sv ) s is recognized as a unified one that includes in its hierarchy all the mm inseparability criteria @xcite .",
    "later , the above mm inseparability criteria has been analyzed in terms of mm of normally ordered operators @xcite , which was also developed by sv aiming at a nonclassicality criterion @xcite .    in this article , in the same spirit of the above approaches  namely , based on mm and npt  we also propose a unified inseparability criterion , especially focusing on the fourth- and even higher - order moments . our study is based on a generalized schrdinger - robertson uncertainty relation ( srur ) recently derived by ivan @xcite .",
    "this naturally includes the original srur in its hierarchy and extends it to arbitrary ( higher ) orders for a single - mode system .",
    "we first develop an inseparability criterion by applying this single - mode srur to a marginal distribution of a partially transposed bipartite system .",
    "we next extend the single - mode srur to a two - mode system and subsequently derive a full two - mode srur inseparability criterion .",
    "we show that our criterion is actually equivalent to sv s , hence is a unified criterion and can detect any npt entanglement . on the other hand ,",
    "our formulation explicitly addresses two orthogonal quadrature amplitudes rather than the creation and the annihilation operators unlike other criteria @xcite .",
    "we also illustrate that our criterion can be more powerful in detecting certain classes of non - gaussian entangled states than the entropy - based criterion @xcite although the latter also addresses higher - order moments in a specific form .",
    "our approach as well as other ones based on mm is experimentally feasible and dose not need a full tomography .",
    "along with theoretical schemes @xcite , experimental technology is being continuously developed .",
    "for instance , refer to a recent breakthrough about detecting higher - order moments of correlation @xcite .",
    "first , we briefly review the generalized schrdinger - robertson ur ( srur ) recently derived by ivan @xcite .",
    "this generalized version involves moments higher than the second and naturally include the second - order ones in its hierarchy .",
    "we begin by noting that every uncertainty relation associated with moments relies on the positivity ( precisely , positive semi - definiteness ) of a density matrix @xmath0 . for an arbitrary linear combination of quantum operators @xmath1 ( @xmath2 s are c - numbers , @xmath3 is the identity operator , and @xmath4 s need not necessarily be hermitian ) , the mean value of the product of its adjoint and itself must be non - negative , , @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , \\label{eq : mf}\\ ] ] and @xmath8 with @xmath9",
    ". the inequality ( 1 ) must be satisfied for arbitrary @xmath2 s , which implies that the matrix of moments , @xmath10 , should be positive semi - definite , , @xmath11 note that the above inequality employing @xmath12 can be made equivalent to @xmath13 where @xmath14 refers to a variance operator @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "henceforth we will consider only the latter case to our aim .",
    "in fact , the second - order srur of any hermitian operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 is equivalent to @xmath18 with @xmath19 , more specifically , @xmath20 this inequality @xmath21 and can also be obtained if the real part of @xmath22 is not omitted when deriving hur using the cauchy - schwartz inequality for operators .",
    "note that srur is invariant under the whole group sp(2 , @xmath23 ) of linear canonical transformations whereas hur is so only under a restricted subset of sp(2 , @xmath23 ) .",

    "alternatively , one may adopt another simpler criterion , which states that a hermitian matrix is nonnegative if and only if one of its leading principal submatrix is positive and the corresponding schur complement is nonnegative . in our case , this can be formulated as follows .",

    "thus far , we have sketched the procedure to construct cm and to check its positivity in a systematic manner .",
    "the next part is devoted to mentioning its covariance property .",
    "we begin by noting that the span of @xmath49 ( of the same @xmath93 ) is invariant under the unitary operator @xmath36 and that each transformed element is in that span , , @xmath94 comparing this with ( [ eq : sympxp ] ) , we notice that @xmath95 .",

    "it is well known that partial transposition can map a bipartite inseparable state to a form not admissible as a legitimate quantum state .",

    ", the fourth - order srur fully detects the inseparability of @xmath130 whereas the entropic criterion does not . in view of this , it is worth emphasizing that although an entropic ur also involves higher - order moments of correlations in a certain form , it does not fully reflect the specific - order  fourth - order in this case  moments .",

    "thus , to conclusively determine whether or not the entanglement is due to a specific order correlation , we should have a full two - mode correlation criterion without marginalization .    with this motivation , we extend the single - mode srur derived by ivan in sec . [",

    "when it comes to the fourth - order criterion in sv framework , one should include apart from @xmath202 ( `` @xmath166 '' is omitted as before ) additional ten operators into @xmath155 in ( [ eq : ecmm ] ) for full inspection , namely , @xmath203 note that the number of these necessary operators is equivalent to that of ( [ eq : tjmab ] ) and hence the two - mode fourth - order srur is equivalent to sv criterion employing 14 operators . in fact , they are equivalent up to any order since the number of independent quadrature operators @xmath204 is the same as that of the ( independent ) annihilation and creation operators @xmath205 and the whole possible combinations of those operators are considered in the mm .",
    "however , it is worth stressing that the srur criterion is based on _ hermitian _ operators and transforms intuitively under local symplectic group sp(2,@xmath23 ) @xmath148 sp(2,@xmath23 ) .",
    "even though the case of @xmath69 in ( [ eq : ecsrur ] ) or equivalently ( [ eq : srur4th ] ) is obviously weaker than the above two full fourth - order criteria , it is arguably said to be more practical in terms of computational cost . for other fourth - order or even higher - order criteria",
    ", interested readers may refer to @xcite , wherein inseparability criteria are analyzed not only in terms of sv criterion but also in terms of sv _ nonclassicality _ criterion , which is based on a mm of normally ordered operators .",
    "in this paper we have presented an inseparability criterion based on the recently derived generalized schrdinger - robertson uncertainty relation ( srur ) @xcite .",
    "this generalized srur that involves two orthogonal quadratures to arbitrary high orders has a hierarchy naturally containing the original ( second - order ) srur as the lowest one . employing the single - mode srur ,",
    "we have first proposed a hierarchy of inseparability criterion using a marginal single - mode distribution of partially transposed state .",
    "this turns out to successfully detect the entanglement of a certain non - gaussian continuous - variable ( cv ) state that is not fully detected by other second - order and entropic criteria .",
    "in particular , the entropic criterion also addresses higher - order correlations of a cv state in a specific form , however , the above example amounts to illustrating that the entropic criterion does not fully reveal step by step the specific - order moments of correlation wherein entanglement is coded .    to delve into the above issue more clearly",
    ", we have extended the single - mode srur to a two - mode one by introducing a systematic ordering for observable operators .",
    "based on this two - mode srur , we have proposed an inseparability criterion which can fully detect the entanglement coded in a specific order of quadrature - variable correlations .",
    "we have also noted that the inseparability criterion based on two - mode generalization of srur is equivalent to shchukin and vogel s criterion .",
    "they are both unified criteria based on moments together with the negativity of partial transposition . in principle , sv criterion may also employ not only non - hermitian but also hermitian operators .",
    "our formulation directly employs hermitian operators , a hierarchy of position and momentum operators , and its full sympletic invariance is more manifest",
    ".    it may be an interesting question whether there can be a class of inseparable states whose entanglement is detected by a sixth - order - moment criterion but not by any lower one , namely , so called _ sixth - order entangled _ states  or , in general , @xmath206-th - order entangled states . in this respect ,",
    "we hope that our study could shed some light on unveiling the structure of entanglement and coming up with its useful classification .",
    "furthermore , we expect that it would also be possible to classify by the same reasoning , , in terms of moments , or a similar one nonclassical correlations such as nonlocality , steering and discord .",
