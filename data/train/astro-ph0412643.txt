    "the inward orbital drift associated with gas drag that would carry such meter - sized bodies from 1 au into the central star is very rapid , and its timescale is only @xmath1 years @xcite .",
    "the direct assemblage of dust grains in laminar flow may be impossible .",
    "one of the scenarios for this stage is due to gravitational instability ( gi ) .",
    "if particles settle into a layer having sufficiently high density and low velocity dispersion , high density region spontaneously collapses under their self - gravity forming km - sized planetesimals @xcite .",
    "there is a critical issue in this gi scenario . as dust grains",
    "settle toward the midplane , the rotational velocity around the midplane increases because of the reduced effect of the gas pressure compared to the centrifugal force and the solar gravity .",

    "the decreasing timescale of inclination is order of stopping time @xmath264 .",

    "the growth of dust aggregates is the fastest process , thus the dust can grow up to @xmath269 . in the region of @xmath267 and @xmath270 , the kelvin - helmholtz instability is the fastest process . in the region of @xmath271 ,",
    "the dust settling is faster than the dust growth , thus we should compare two processes : the settling and the kelvin - helmholtz instability . in the region of @xmath272 ,",
    "the settling velocity is very fast and the kelvin - helmholtz instability is not effective , thus the settling region expands into higher @xmath273 region as the size of dust @xmath159 increases .",
    "we assume that the turbulent flow become laminar if the timescale of kelvin - helmholtz instability is larger than those of other processes .",
    "if the density and the size of dust aggregates are @xmath274 , the dust aggregates grow up to @xmath269 without the dust settling . when @xmath275 , the dust aggregates start settling and the kelvin - helmholtz instability occurs , which develops turbulence in the dust layer",
    "the dust aggregates may grow owing to the random velocity field in the turbulent flow , thus the timescale of the kelvin - helmholtz instability will increase with the growth of dust . when the size of dust grain becomes sufficiently large , @xmath276 ,",
    "the dust aggregates begin to settle .",
    "hence the dust layer may evolve along the boundary line between the turbulence region and the settling region in figure [ fig : path_ordinary2.eps ] .",
    "the density of dust in the disk may reach @xmath277 at @xmath278 .",
    "@xmath279 corresponds to the order of the critical density for the gravitational instability .",
    "however this argument is not conclusive , because the critical density may be larger than @xmath280 .",
    "a more realistic critical density depends on a unperturbed dust density profile .",
    "actually @xcite conclude that the critical density for the constant richardson number dust density distribution is @xmath281 and that for the gaussian dust density distribution is @xmath282 .",
    "thus the realistic condition of the gravitational instability seems to be depend on the circumstances .",
    "@xcite showed that the shear instability which grows slower than the kepler timescale without the coriolis and tidal forces is suppressed if these forces are taken into account .",
    "their analysis is based on the strong coupling approximation but our analysis is not based on it , thus we can not use their result directly . to take into account the coriolis and tidal forces",
    ", we assume that the region @xmath283 should correspond to a stable region , where @xmath284 is the timescale of the shear instability without the coriolis and tidal forces , @xmath285 is the kepler timescale .",
    "we plot the stable region in figure [ fig : path3.eps ] .",
    "this effect causes little change on a possible path .",
    "the growth timescale for meter - size particles is longer than the timescale of the migration into central star because of the large radial velocity@xcite .",
    "this is correct when the dust density is smaller than the gas density ( @xmath286 ) .",
    "the radial velocity in the case of @xmath76 is slower than the radial velocity in the case of @xmath286 @xcite .",
    "the radial velocity of dust is expressed as @xmath287 thus the migration timescale @xmath288 is @xmath289 in the limit of @xmath290 , the migration timescale is proportional to @xmath291 . in the case where @xmath292 and @xmath293 , the migration timescale is about @xmath1 year at 1 au .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath294 and @xmath218 , the migration timescale is about @xmath295 year .",
    "thus the dust aggregates can avoid migration onto their central star and lead to the gravitational instability , if the growth timescale in the turbulent flow is shorter than the migration timescale @xmath295 year .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the kelvin - helmholtz instability for the dusty fluid taking into account of the effect of relative motion between gas and dust .    to clarify the physics of kelvin - helmholtz instability in the dusty fluid",
    ", we have analyzed the linear stability of the flow whose velocity profile is the simple heaviside step function .",
    "we have found the stabilizing effect due to friction . in the case of @xmath296 ,",

    "we have considered the case of dusty layer between two gaseous layers .",
    "because of the symmetry , there are the even mode ( @xmath102 ) and the odd mode ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "we have found that the growth rate for odd modes is more unstable than that for even modes .",
    "we have analyzed the linear stability in a more realistic protoplanetary disk where the dust density distribution is a sinusoidal density distribution . in the case of @xmath267",
    ", we found the stabilization due to the friction .",
    "this result is consistent with the result in the case of the step function velocity profile .",
    "however the timescale of the stabilized kelvin - helmholtz instability is shorter than that of settling , thus the dust layer becomes turbulent before the gravitational instability sets in . in the case of @xmath299 , since the shear is small , the kelvin - helmholtz instability is stabilized sufficiently . in this case , if the dust aggregates begin to settles , it is expected that the dust settles without stirring up and may reach the critical density .",
    "we have compared the timescales of the dust growth , the dust settling , and kelvin - helmholtz instability , and proposed a scenario in which the dust layer proceeds along the boundary between the turbulent region and settling region in figure [ fig : path_ordinary2.eps ] , and the dust layer reaches the order of critical density of gravitational instability at @xmath278 . in this way",
    ", the planetesimals may be formed through gravitational instability .    to justify this scenario",
    ", we have to do the detailed numerical calculation of the growth of dust aggregates in the turbulent flow . in this paper",
    ", we neglected the size - distribution of dust grains whose effect should be studied .",
    "we expect the density of dust layer becomes critical density for gravitational instability with the help of turbulence .",
    "however the dust grains in the turbulent flow have the velocity dispersion .",
    "thus the critical density for gravitational instability possibly changes owing to the increased velocity dispersion of dust grains .",
