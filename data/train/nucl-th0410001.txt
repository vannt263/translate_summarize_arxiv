    "take the polarisabilities : the photon field displaces the charged constituents of the neutron , inducing a non - vanishing multipole moment .",
    "polarisabilities are a measure for the polarisation induced , i.e.  for the global stiffness of the neutron against an electro - magnetic field .",

    "there are six dipole polarisabilities : two spin - independent ones ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) for electric and magnetic dipole transitions which do not couple to the nucleon spin ; and in the spin sector , two diagonal ( `` pure '' ) spin - polarisabilities ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) , and two off - diagonal ( `` mixed '' ) spin - polarisabilities , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "these spin - polarisabilities are particularly interesting , as they parameterise the response of the nucleon spin to the photon field , having no classical analogon .",
    "in addition , there are higher ones like quadrupole and octupole polarisabilities , with negligible contributions .",
    "little is known about the nucleon polarisabilities , and albeit these nucleon structure effects have been known for many decades , most experiments have focused on just two numbers , namely the static electric and magnetic polarisabilities @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",

    "is this a failure of @xmath43eft , just like the potential - model approach fails ?",
    "we argue in ref .  @xcite that the discrepancy is dissolved once the full energy - dependence of the polarisabilities",
    "is taken into account , including all degrees of freedom at low energies inside the nucleon : polarisabilities depend on the photon energy @xmath6 because different polarisation mechanisms react quite differently to real photon fields of non - zero frequency .",
    "therefore , these _ energy - dependent _ or _ dynamical polarisabilities _",
    "contain detailed information about dispersive effects , caused by internal relaxation , baryonic resonances and mesonic production thresholds . at present , various theoretical frameworks are able to provide a consistent , qualitative picture for the leading static polarisabilities .",
    "their dynamical origin is however only properly revealed by their energy - dependence .",
    "a rigorous definition of the dynamical polarisabilities starts instead of ( [ polsfromints ] ) from a multipole - decomposition of the @xmath48-matrix of real compton scattering ; purists consider ref .",
    "it turns out that all polarisabilities beyond the dipole ones are so far invisible in observables .",
    "this is why they were sacrificed to brevity in the expressions above .",
    "dynamical polarisabilities are a concept complementary to _ generalised _ polarisabilities of the nucleon .",
    "the latter probe the nucleon in virtual compton scattering , i.e.  with an incoming photon of non - zero virtuality , and possibly provide information about the spatial distribution of charges and magnetism inside the nucleon .",
    "their extraction is however notoriously difficult . _",
    "dynamical polarisabilities _ on the other hand test the global response of the internal nucleonic degrees of freedom to a _ real _ photon of _ non - zero _ energy and answer the question _ which _ internal degrees of freedom govern the structure of the nucleon at low energies . like all quantities defined by multipole - decompositions",
    ", they do not contain more or less information than the corresponding compton scattering amplitudes , but the facts are more readily accessible and easier to interpret .    to identify the microscopically dominant low - energy degrees of freedom inside the nucleon in a model - independent way",

    "( 2 ) it is well known that the excitation of the lowest nuclear resonance , the @xmath44 , as intermediate state by the strongly para - magnetic @xmath50 @xmath51 transition leads to a para - magnetic contribution to the static magnetic dipole polarisability @xmath52 $ ] . a characteristic resonance shape should occur , like predicted by the lorentz model of polarisabilities in classical electro - dynamics .",
    "( 3 ) as the observed static value @xmath53 is smaller by a factor of @xmath54 , another strongly dia - magnetic component must exist .",
    "we sub - sume this short - distance physics which is not generated by the pion or @xmath49 into two low - energy coefficients @xmath55 , which are _ energy - independent_. while nave power - counting sees them suppressed by one order , experiment tells us otherwise . according to @xmath43eft , the proton and neutron polarisabilities are furthermore very similar , iso - vectorial effects being of higher order in the power counting .",

    "we compare with a result from dispersion theory , in which the energy - dependent effects are sub - sumed into integrals over experimental input from a different kinematical rgime , namely photo - absorption cross - section @xmath56 .",
    "its major source of error is the uncertainty in modelling the dispersive integral above the two - pion production threshold .",
    "the pronounced pion - cusp in @xmath57 is quantitatively reproduced already at leading order .",
    "the dipole spin - polarisabilities are predictions , three of them being completely independent of the parameter - determination , and are well - matched  @xcite .",
    "no genuinely new low - energy degrees of freedom inside the nucleon are missing .",
    "most notably however is the strong energy - dependence induced into @xmath58 even below the pion - production threshold by the unique signature of the @xmath49 resonance : at @xmath59 mev , @xmath60 is about @xmath61 units larger than its static value , rendering the traditional approximation of @xmath58 as `` static - plus - small - slope '' @xmath62 inadequate .",
    "it also reveals the good quantitative agreement between the measured value of @xmath63 and the prediction in a @xmath43eft without explicit @xmath49 as accidental : the contribution from the pion - cloud alone is not dispersive enough to explain the energy - dependence of @xmath60 . in @xmath43eft without explicit @xmath49 , its part is played by short - distance contributions which show only a slow energy - dependence .",
    "fitting in @xmath43eft with @xmath49 the two short - distance parameters @xmath55 to deuteron compton scattering data above @xmath64 mev ( fig .  [",
    "fig : dcompton ] ) , one finds for the static values : @xmath65 the baldin sum rule @xmath33 is already well reproduced by the unconstrained fit . comparing with the static proton polarisabilities determined by the same method in  @xcite , @xmath66",

    "figure  [ fig : ddelta ] shows that the dispersion originating in excitations of the @xmath49 is indeed pivotal to reproduce the shape of the data at @xmath1 mev in particular at back - angles : the calculations by beane et al .",

    "to finish the story , work is under way on a few more chapters , for example :    \\(i ) as the extracted numbers ( [ deuteronvalues ] ) suggest , the cross - sections depend on the deuteron wave - function used on the @xmath70-level .",
    "the main reason is certainly that the electro - magnetic currents used are not tailored to the potential ; the deviation from consistent currents is however a higher - order effect ( and also numerically small ) .",
    "\\(iii ) the proposed analysis of compton scattering via a multipole decomposition at fixed energies  @xcite will not only provide better data on the neutron polarisabilities .",
    "it will also further our knowledge on the spin - polarisabilities , and hence on the spin - structure of the nucleon .",
    "double - polarised , high - accuracy experiments provide a new avenue to extract the energy - dependence of the six dipole polarisabilities per nucleon , both spin - independent and spin - dependent  @xcite .",
    "what we need is more data : for example , with only 29 ( un - polarised ) points for the deuteron in a small energy range of @xmath71 $ ] mev and error bars on the order of @xmath72 , experiments can improve the situation substantially",
    ". a ( certainly incomplete ) list of planned or approved experiments at photon energies below @xmath73 shows the concerted effort in this field : polarised photons on polarised deuterons and @xmath74he at tunl / hi@xmath75s ; tagged protons at s - dalinac ; polarised photons on polarised protons at mami ; and deuteron targets at maxlab .",
    "\\(iv ) why are the data at @xmath76 and @xmath30 mev not included in our analysis ? in contradistinction to the high - energy data , it is well known , see e.g.  @xcite , that the correct thomson limit puts a severe constraint on compton scattering at low energies .",
    "the @xmath43eft - power - counting of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] is not tailored to the low - energy end and must be modified to produce the thomson limit on the deuteron .",

    "@xcite , and a full treatment is in its finishing stages  @xcite .",
    "\\(v ) at lower energies , the pion - exchange terms can be integrated out , and one arrives at the `` pion - less '' eft of qcd . not only is this version computationally considerably less involved than the pion - ful version @xmath43eft ; it also has the advantage that the thomson limit is recovered trivially . while compton scattering becomes the less sensitive to the polarisabilities the lower the energy , a window exists between about @xmath77 and @xmath78 mev where this variant can aide high - accuracy experiments e.g.  at hi@xmath75s to extract the static polarisabilities in a model - independent way",
