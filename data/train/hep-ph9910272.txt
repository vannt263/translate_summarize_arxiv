    "confinement in mesons and baryons should be very similar since color dynamics is sensitive at large distances only to the net color charge of the interacting sources .",
    "thus whether a quark is bound to an antiquark or to a diquark in a color @xmath1 ( as it must be for a baryon to be in an overall color singlet ) should make no difference at large separation ( or alternatively at high excitation ) . for similar reasons , the one - gluon - exchange forces in mesons and baryons",
    "are very closely related : pairwise forces in baryons have exactly half the strength of those in mesons ( for identical spins and separations ) .    given this close connection between meson and baryon dynamics and the success of the quark model in meson spectroscopy , it is surprising that there is still an unsettled qualitative problem in the quark model for baryons : the so - called  baryon spin - orbit puzzle \" that baryon spin - orbit splittings appear to be much smaller than expected from their one - gluon - exchange matrix elements @xcite .",
    "however , by this criterion the mesons would also have a spin - orbit problem .",
    "meson spin - orbit splittings are also much smaller than expected from their one - gluon - exchange matrix elements @xcite , but mesons have no spin - orbit problem because the  normal \" spin - orbit matrix element is largely cancelled by a strong  inverted \" spin - orbit matrix element from thomas precession in the confining potential .",
    "the physics behind this cancellation has received support recently from analyses of heavy quarkonia , where both analytic techniques @xcite and numerical studies using lattice qcd @xcite have shown that the confining forces are spin - independent _ apart _ from the inevitable spin - orbit pseudoforce due to thomas precession . moreover , as has been known for more than ten years , the data on charmonia require an inverted spin - orbit matrix element from thomas precession in the confining potential to cancel part of the strength of the oge matrix element @xcite . if the charm quark were sufficiently massive , its low - lying spectrum would be rigorously dominated by one gluon exchange , and one indeed observes that the @xmath2 system is closer to this ideal .",
    "conversely , as one moves from @xmath3 to lighter quarks , the @xmath4 wave functions move farther out into the confining potential and the relative strength of the thomas precession term grows .",
    "it is thus very natural to expect a strong cancellation in light quark systems .",
    "as shown in the original isgur - karl paper on the p - wave baryons @xcite , a very similar cancellation appears to occur at the two - body level in baryons .",
    "however , unlike mesons , baryons can also experience three - body spin - orbit forces @xcite ( _ e.g. , _ potentials proportional to @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the spin , position , and momentum of quark @xmath9 ) .",
    "the matrix elements of these three body spin - orbit forces are all calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , but no apparent cancellation amongst them is found .",
    "_ i.e. , _ the spin - orbit puzzle might more properly be called the  baryon three - body spin - orbit puzzle \" . in view of the facts that one could understand the smallness of spin - orbit forces in mesons and that the data also clearly called for small spin - orbit forces in baryons , the isgur - karl model anticipated a solution to the baryon three - body spin - orbit puzzle and _ as a first approximation _ discarded all spin - orbit forces .",
    "it was assumed that , as in mesons , a more precise and broadly applicable description would have to treat residual spin - orbit interactions . in the meantime ,",
    "a possible solution to this problem has been suggested @xcite in which relativistic effects enhance spin - spin over spin - orbit effects . this suggestion may prove to be correct , though it would then be an accident that in mesons a nonrelativistic solution presents itself . in this paper",
    "i identify a special class of baryons which exhibit a meson - like solution to the spin - orbit puzzle and lead to a new perspective on this old problem .",
    "consider a @xmath10 baryon in which the @xmath11 quark pair is compact and @xmath12 is far from their center - of - mass , as shown in fig .",
    "as previously mentioned , the @xmath11 pair must be in a color @xmath1 , so the forces between it and @xmath12 are the same as those between an antiquark and @xmath12 .",
    "if the internal dynamics of the @xmath11 pair were independent of @xmath13 , then each @xmath11 eigenstate would act as an extended quasi - antiquark with which @xmath12 could form a tower of meson - like excited states . the simplest such @xmath11 pair , and",
    "the one which is the focus of this paper , has the @xmath11 pair in its isospin zero and spin zero ground state .",
    "i label these state @xmath14 s since in them only the @xmath12 relative coordinate is excited over the ground state @xmath15 .",
    "we will see that the only spin - dependent forces in these states are the spin - orbit forces experienced by @xmath12 , so they are a natural choice for a system in which to investigate the baryon spin - orbit puzzle .",

    "note that by construction @xmath40 is an auxillary parameter which can be chosen to minimize the importance of @xmath30 . in what follows",
    "i take @xmath41 where the first term is the color coulomb potential between quarks in a baryon ( to be contrasted with @xmath42 in a meson ) , @xmath43 is a constant , and @xmath44 is the long - range confining potential .",

    "each of these towers of excited states have a spacing of @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the @xmath56 reduced mass .      as mentioned earlier , @xmath40 is an auxillary parameter which may be chosen to minimize the perturbation @xmath30 . since , consistent with the @xmath55 symmetry of this system , eq . ( [ eq : hozero ] ) is trivially generalized to allow the @xmath63 spring constant to be distinct from the @xmath64 and @xmath65 spring constants , the @xmath37 and @xmath38 spring constants may be taken to be independent auxillary parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",

    "the subtowers consisting of states of fixed @xmath68 ( but excitation labelled by @xmath69 ) are all mutually orthogonal , so choosing @xmath67 to optimize the energy and wave function of @xmath70 is a good strategy for producing accurate orthonormalized eigenfunctions of the spin - independent hamiltonian .",
    "( i optimize @xmath71 for each @xmath68 since these are the phenomenologically most relevant states ) . given this strategy , one never actually resorts to perturbation theory in @xmath30 for the @xmath71 states : their energies and eigenfunctions are best determined variationally .",

    "figure 1(b ) suggests that the tower of @xmath14 baryons i have described here will provide the simplest setting in which to begin to understand the baryon spin - orbit problem since , at least naively , they ought to have meson - like dynamics .",
    "i have shown here that this expectation is in fact correct and that this select tower of baryons has no  spin - orbit puzzle \" .",
    "the key to the solution of the puzzle for this select group of baryons is that for them the microscopic three - body spin - orbit forces described in the literature conspire to produce only meson - like quasi - two - body spin - orbit forces . as a result",
    "these states experience the same strong cancellation between dynamical spin - orbit forces and thomas precession which leads to small spin - orbit effects in mesons .",
    "it is possible that this work has no implications beyond identifying these special states .",
    "however , in studying these states we have also developed a new perspective on the forces in baryons which may have a wider utility in confronting the baryon spin - orbit puzzle .",
    "in particular , we have seen that the standard classification in the literature of spin - orbit forces as being two- and three - body is somewhat misleading . this classification is correct at the microscopic level ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:3bodyso ] ) ) , but not very relevant to the issue of whether the spin - orbit forces on a given quark @xmath12 appear to arise from the baryon center - of - mass , i.e. , whether they are quasi - two - body in character . with the spin - orbit puzzle solved for a slice through the baryon spectrum",
    ", it would be odd if there were an intractable spin - orbit problem in baryons . at the least",
    ", one may hope that the simple interpretation described here in terms of quasi - two - body ( i.e. , meson - like ) dynamics will lead to further insights into the spin - orbit puzzle .",
    "in fact the arguments presented here for the @xmath14 baryons are immediately generalizable to the spin - orbit force on the third quark @xmath12 in @xmath85 and @xmath86 states , the total quark spin @xmath87 and @xmath88 @xmath89 baryons with the same spatial wave functions as @xmath90 .",
    "since these three  uds basis \" states @xcite are sufficient to completely describe the su(3 ) baryon spectrum , it might seem that an even more substantial generalization is in hand : in the su(3 ) limit , baryon wave functions have permutation symmetry , so proving that quark 3 has meson - like spin - orbit forces is sufficient to prove that each quark does .",
    "however , in the su(3 ) limit @xmath91 and our proofs are inapplicable : with such a degeneracy , leading order spin - orbit effects can occur _ via _ mixing between @xmath34 and @xmath35 excitations .",
    "thus extending the considerations presented here beyond the spin - orbit force on @xmath12 in @xmath92 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 will be nontrivial .",
    "using our new perspective of quasi - two - body forces , we can visualize at least one obstacle to such extensions .",
    "consider the counterparts to our @xmath14 state in which the @xmath34 variable is in a state with @xmath93 but @xmath94 .",
    "in these circumstances the @xmath11 pair will develop an orbital color magnetic moment proportional to @xmath95 with which the color magnetic moment @xmath96 will in general interact .",
    "it would thus seem to require a careful reanalysis of the effects of spin - orbit splittings on the baryon spectrum from this new perspective to determine if all of the _ observed _ nearly degenerate spin - orbit multiplets can be accommodated within it , and , if they can not be , to define the next steps along the path to solving this old problem .",
    "it of course remains possible , despite the tantalizing fact that mesons and now the @xmath14 states admit a nonrelativistic solution to their spin - orbit splittings , that the ultimate solution is as suggested in ref.@xcite : that relativistic effects have simply produced a gross enhancement of spin - spin over spin - orbit interactions .          for a general review of the isgur - karl model and for references , see n. isgur in _ modern topics in electron scattering _ , ed .",
