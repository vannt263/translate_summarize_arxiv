    "the spectrum is absolutely continuous , while in the quasi - periodic case , it can have any nature : absolutely continuous , singular continuous and pure point .",
    "the transition between different types of spectrum can happen even with a small change of a coefficient in a quasi - periodic operator @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of the difference in spectral behavior between periodic and quasi - periodic cases can be explained by a phenomenon which is known as resonance tunneling in quantum mechanics .",
    "it is associated with small denominators appearing in formal series of perturbation theory .",
    "since the spectrum of the one - dimensional laplacian is thin ( multiplicity 2 ) , resonance tunneling can produce an effect strong enough to destroy the spectrum .",
    "if a potential is periodic , then resonance tunneling produces gaps in the spectrum near the points @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 being the period of the potential .",
    "if the potential is quasi - periodic , then it can be thought as a sort of combination of infinite number of periodic potentials , each of them producing gaps near its own @xmath18-s .",
    "since the set of all @xmath18-s can be dense , the number of points surrounded by gaps can be dense too .",

    "the essential difference is that in @xcite@xcite we constructed a modification of kam method , where the space variable @xmath63 still plays some role ( e.g. in the uniform in @xmath63 approximation of a limit - periodic potential by periodic ones ) , while in the present situation all considerations are happening in the space of the dual variable @xmath6 .",

    "absence of formulas causes difficulties in estimating the size of @xmath175 . to treat this problem",
    "we start with introducing an angle variable @xmath176 , @xmath177 and consider sets @xmath151 in terms of this variable .",

    "we take all values of @xmath183 in a small interval and @xmath72 in some subset of @xmath70 .",
    "further , we extend our considerations to a complex neighborhood @xmath184 of @xmath185 . we show that the determinants are analytic functions of @xmath136 and , by this , reduce the problem of estimating the size of the resonant set to a problem in complex analysis .",

    ". the essential difference of our method from constructions of non - resonant sets in similar situations before ( see e.g. @xcite@xcite , @xcite ) is that we construct a non - resonant set not only in the whole space of a parameter ( @xmath190 here ) , but also on isoenergetic curves @xmath191 in the space of the parameter , when @xmath165 is sufficiently large .",
    "estimates for the size of non - resonant sets on a curve require more subtle technical considerations than those sufficient for description of a non - resonant set in the whole space of the parameter .",
    "but as a reward , such estimates enable us to show that every isoenergetic set for @xmath192 is not empty and thus , to prove bethe - sommerfeld conjecture .",
    "note that generalization of the results from the case @xmath193 , @xmath2 being an integer , to the case of rational @xmath2 satisfying the same inequality is relatively simple ; it requires just slightly more careful technical considerations .",
