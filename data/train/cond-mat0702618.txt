    "this led to the introduction of timescale dependent effective temperatures  @xcite , and a possible thermodynamic interpretation of aging  @xcite .",
    "in many systems of physical interest , however , such as liquids quenched below the glass transition or domain growth in disordered magnets @xcite , the dynamics is not of mean - field type .",

    "theoretical studies have found ill - defined fdrs  @xcite , non - monotonic response functions  @xcite , observable dependence  @xcite , nontrivial fdrs without thermodynamic transitions  @xcite and a subtle interplay between growing dynamical correlation lengthscales and fdt violations  @xcite . also in experiments deviations from mean - field expectations have been observed , with for example anomalously large fdt violations associated with intermittent dynamics  @xcite .",
    "it thus remains an important task to delineate when the mean - field concept of an fdr - related effective temperature remains viable .    in this paper , we focus on the one - dimensional fredrickson - andersen ( fa ) model @xcite .",

    "we use it to study systematically the impact of activated , and in this sense strongly non mean - field , dynamics on fdrs and associated effective temperatures . in addition , the fa model dynamics become critical at low temperatures @xcite , with a diverging dynamical lengthscale . our work is also of relevance , therefore , to the study of fdrs in nonequilibrium critical dynamics . here",

    "more recent numerical studies @xcite based on the correct , connected correlations indicate a very different picture : _ no _ detectable violation of the equilibrium fdt is observed in spite of the nonequilibrium aging dynamics .",

    "as will become clear immediately it is useful to substitute the explicit form of @xmath81 and , through a shift of the summation variable , rewrite the master operator as @xmath82 the key feature of eq .",
    "( [ equ : wfa ] ) is that @xmath83 operates only in the subspace @xmath84 .",
    "it therefore represents a _",
    "pair reaction process_. in the analysis of pair reaction processes it is conventional to choose an explicit representation for the basis @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",

    "the pair reaction picture is of course exact .",
    "we note that a modified version of the fa model with kinetic constraint @xmath110 has often been used in the literature since it was first proposed @xcite .",
    "it has certain advantages for simulations because @xmath111 is just a binary variable indicating whether the constraint of having at least one mobile neighbour is satisfied .",
    "however , for analytical work the presence of the quadratic term @xmath112 is awkward and prevents in particular a pair reaction representation like the one above .",
    "nevertheless the scaling behaviour in the modified fa model is expected to match with the original version @xcite discussed here .",
    "the branching and coagulation process eq .  ( [ equ : wfa4x4 ] ) gives rise to the remarkably rich dynamics of the fa model .",

    "indeed , we have recently carried out such simulations for the fa model and the results are in very good agreement with the theoretical predictions set out above  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have analysed the nonequilibrium fluctuation - dissipation ( fd ) behaviour of the one - dimensional fa model after a quench to low temperature .",
    "the dynamics in this regime is essentially a diffusion - coagulation process , and the link from this to diffusion - annihilation and thence to the glauber - ising chain allowed us to obtain exact scaling results for the correlation and response functions of defects ( mobile regions ) .",
    "we were thus able to resolve a puzzle posed by simulation results @xcite : the equilibrium behaviour suggested by numerical fd plots of local quantities is only apparent and hides the underlying non - equilibrium effects .",
    "the root cause of this is that the regime where the fdr @xmath66 differs from unity becomes progressively compressed , as times grow , into a corner of the plot .",
    "the fdr @xmath66 itself is nevertheless a nontrivial scaling function of @xmath573 .",
    "a second key observation was that local and global defect observables give consistent values of the asymptotic fdr @xmath581 , reinforcing the generality of our findings for ising models @xcite .",
    "an unexpected result of our analysis is that @xmath581 is , in fact , negative .",

    "however , our analysis showed that the negative value of @xmath581 can be traced to the behaviour of the response functions , which are sensitive to the _ activated _ nature of the dynamics @xcite . in the global response function ,",
    "for example , the applied perturbation corresponds effectively to an increase in temperature . in equilibrium",
    "this should _ increase _ the energy .",

    ", we found a negative ( impulse ) response @xmath583 .",
    "except at short time differences , it is @xmath2-independent and just given by the time derivative ( at time @xmath23 ) of the unperturbed energy relaxation : the small `` extra time '' provided by the perturbation has the same effect whenever it is applied .",
    "as regards the wider applicability of our results , we have repeatedly emphasised that the two - time correlation functions we have calculated are exact for generic diffusion - limited pair coagulation ( dlpc ) processes in one dimension , in the long - time scaling limit . in the regime of small time differences , @xmath664 , the behaviour",
    "is easily rationalized in terms of non - interacting random walkers .",
    "rather less trivial is the behaviour in the opposite regime @xmath577 .",
    "here we find scaling exponents identical to those for diffusion - annihilation ( dlpa ) processes , but quantitatively different scaling functions .",
    "the propagators used to derive these results are exact for the free fermion dlpc and dlpa processes .",
    "higher order propagators could be obtained immediately from the results in @xcite and would form the key to analysing multi - particle and/or multi - time correlations in these processes for general initial conditions .",
    "our response function results are similarly exact for generic dlpc processes in the long - time limit . here",
    "one has to bear in mind , however , that the way the perturbation by the field enters can vary between models . for example , a dlpc process can be realized as the @xmath665 limit of the one - dimensional potts model @xcite with hamiltonian @xmath666 , @xmath667 , and glauber rates . at low temperatures the domain walls @xmath668 have dlpc dynamics with coagulation rate 1 and diffusion rate from bond @xmath669 to @xmath670 of @xmath671 , with the fields @xmath158 conjugate to @xmath40 .",
    "this is precisely the asymmetric part of the perturbation that we found in the fa model ; the symmetric part , which in the fa case contains all the activation effects , is absent . because the asymmetric part of the response behaves similarly in dlpc and dlpa , see comments at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : rad ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : rae ] , the fd behaviour is then also like in the annihilation case @xcite , with an asymptotic fdr @xmath672 .",
    "our results also shed light on a recently proposed method for measuring response functions in spin systems @xcite and deriving associated nonequilibrium fd - relations .",
    "this approach assumes a specific asymmetric form of the perturbation , which in the fa case effectively amounts to discarding the symmetric part of the response .",
    "as the discussion of the potts model above shows , this has drastic effects ; in particular , it would lead one to conclude incorrectly that the fa model has a vanishing asymptotic fdr instead of the nontrivial value @xmath673 .",
    "the method of @xcite and the out - of - equilibrium fd - relation derived from it can therefore not be accepted as generally valid .",
    "it is worth noting that our result for the response function of the fa model has recently been quoted as being consistent with the predictions of a generalized form of local scale invariance @xcite .",

    "in future work it will be interesting to extend our calculations to the response and correlation of fourier modes of the defect density , which contain the global ( energy ) observable as the limiting case of zero wavevector .",
    "such fourier decompositions have proved valuable in the past in , e.g. , ising models @xcite and also lend themselves naturally to a comparison with field - theoretical results in two or more dimensions @xcite .",
    "taking a broader view , it will be essential to establish how generic our finding of negative response functions is : the link to activated dynamics suggests that , once properly measured using , e.g. , global observables , negative responses may be much more common than previously thought .",
