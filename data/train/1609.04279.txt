    "fermi surface nesting is a very popular and important concept in condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "the existence of two fragments of the fermi surface , which can be matched upon translation by a certain reciprocal lattice vector ( nesting vector ) , entails an instability of a fermi liquid state .",
    "a superstructure or additional order parameter related to nesting vector is generated due to the instability .",
    "the nesting is widely invoked for the analysis of charge density wave ( cdw ) states  @xcite , spin density waves ( sdw ) states  @xcite , mechanisms of high-@xmath0 superconductivity  @xcite , fluctuating charge / orbital modulation in magnetic oxides  @xcite , chromium and its alloys  @xcite , etc .",
    "it is important to emphasize that in a real material the nesting may be imperfect , i.e. the fermi surface fragments can only match approximately .",
    "one of the earliest studies of imperfect nesting was performed by rice  @xcite in the context of chromium and its alloys ( see also the review articles refs .  ) .",
    "quite recently , it was demonstrated that the imperfect - nesting mechanism can be responsible for the nanoscale phase separation in chromium alloys  @xcite , iron - based superconductors  @xcite , and in doped bilayer graphene  @xcite . in this context ,",
    "studies of spin and charge inhomogeneities related to imperfect nesting are currently active in the physics of low - dimensional compounds .",
    "@xcite other types of inhomogeneous states ( i.e , `` stripes '' , domain walls ) were also discussed in the literature in the framework of similar models  @xcite . moreover , it was shown that the possibility of sdw ordering in systems with itinerant charge carriers results in very rich and complicated phase diagrams involving phase - separation regions  @xcite .",
    "an applied magnetic field @xmath1 alters the quasiparticle states , changing the nesting conditions . in the present paper",
    ", we explore the physical consequences of the applied magnetic field for weakly - correlated electron systems with imperfect nesting . in a generic situation",
    ", the magnetic field enters the hamiltonian both via the zeeman term , and via the substitution @xmath2 .",
    "the zeeman term lifts the degeneracy with respect to the spin projection .",
    "both electron and hole fermi surface sheets become split into two spin - polarized components . as a result",
    ", two different sdw order parameters corresponding to spin projections parallel and antiparallel to the direction of @xmath1 can be constructed .",
    "when the electron - hole symmetry between the electron and hole pockets is absent , the effects of the zeeman term is especially pronounced . in particular , new antiferromagnetic ( afm ) phases ,",
    "both homogeneous and inhomogeneous , appear in the phase diagram .",
    "the boundaries between different phases exhibit strong dependence on @xmath3 .",
    "for example , such effects were found in the analysis of the magnetic phase diagram of doped rare - earth borides  @xcite .",
    "we also study separately phenomena caused by the landau quantization . in the range of high magnetic fields",
    ", landau quantization leads to characteristic oscillations of the sdw order parameters and of the nel temperature as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "however , these oscillations are most clearly pronounced in the case of symmetric electron and hole pockets . otherwise , the nesting and , hence , the sdw ordering would be completely destroyed by the magnetic field before any detectable oscillations would occur .",
    "similar oscillatory effects are well - known in the context of quasi - one - dimensional compounds  @xcite .",
    "however , the role of the magnetic field in nesting - related phenomena in the usual three - dimensional materials has received only limited attention  @xcite .",

    "formally , the hamiltonian is represented as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the single - electron term , and @xmath9 corresponds to the interaction between quasiparticles .    regarding the single - electron term , we assume a quadratic dispersion for both bands and use the wigner  seitz approximation .",
    "specifically , in the electron band , the wave vector @xmath10 is confined within a sphere of finite radius centered around zero , and in the hole band , such sphere is centered around @xmath6 .",
    "the kinetic energies of these states are spread between the minimum values ( denoted by @xmath11 ) and maximum values @xmath12 , see fig .  [ band ] .",

    "however , the mapped phase diagram is unlikely to be universal : in the situation where many states with similar energies compete against each other to become the ground state , it is impossible to predict accurately the outcome of this competition .",
    "needless to say , the simplifications of our approach , and the contributions , which we have intentionally omitted ( lattice effects , realistic shape of the fermi surface , disorder ) , can play an important role in the final balance .",
    "thus , a broad input from experiments is crucial for the correct identification of different thermodynamic phases .    the orbital contribution to the hamiltonian leads to the landau quantization of the single - particle orbits . as a result",
    ", we have demonstrated that both order parameters and the nel temperatures oscillate as the magnetic field changes .",
    "this behavior is associated with the oscillatory part of the single - particle density of states , which emerges due to the landau quantization . the same oscillations of the density of states are also the cause of the de haas  van alphen effect .",
    "yet another related phenomenon , the so - called field - induced sdw , is known to occur in quasi - one - dimensional materials  @xcite .",
    "pronounced oscillations of both @xmath194 and @xmath218 develop at sufficiently large magnetic fields .",
    "this circumstance makes their experimental observation a delicate issue .",
    "indeed , the results of section  [ secthighb ] were obtained under the assumption of perfect electron  hole symmetry . in a more realistic case , this symmetry is broken , and the magnetic field may cause a transition into a phase with a different order parameter , or destroy the sdw completely before an observable oscillatory trend sets in .",
    "we demonstrated that in electron systems with imperfect nesting the applied magnetic field leads to a significant increase in the number of possible ordered states .",
    "it also affects the inhomogeneous , phase - separated states of the system . at higher fields",
    ", the landau quantization causes oscillations of the sdw order parameters and of the corresponding nel temperatures .",

    "here , we derive the explicit expression for the density of states given by eq .  .",
    "the main idea is to divide the density of states into monotonic and oscillatory parts ( a similar approach is used , e.g. , in chapter  6 of ref .  ) . to do this",
    ", we first take the integral over @xmath185 in eq .  , which gives @xmath219 where @xmath220 , \\quad a=\\frac{e}{\\omega_h}-\\frac{1}{2}-n_0\\,,\\ ] ] and @xmath221 $ ] denotes the integer part of a real number .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 , by its definition , is the fractional part of @xmath222 . using formulas from the theory of euler integrals , @xmath223 we write the sum in eq .   in the form @xmath224",
    "where @xmath225    in the limit @xmath226 one has @xmath227 substituting all these expressions into eq .   and expanding it in powers of @xmath226 , we obtain @xmath228 + o\\!\\left(\\frac{\\omega^2_h}{\\varepsilon^2_{f\\sigma}}\\right)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath229 is the density of states at zero magnetic field .    the second term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ dos_decay ] ) oscillates as @xmath3 changes , since @xmath4 is an oscillating function of @xmath3 , see eq .",
    "( [ n_a ] ) .",
    "we expand the function @xmath230 in a fourier series @xmath231 where the coefficients of the series can be calculated analytically @xmath232 keeping the leading corrections , we can write @xmath233 where the prime at the summation sign implies that the term with @xmath234 has to be omitted . now , we substitute eqs .",
    " in eq .   and obtain the equation for the order parameter in the form @xmath235    as a consistency check ,",
    "let us consider the limit of vanishing magnetic field . in this case",
    "only the first term in the integral above survives , and one obtains @xmath236 thus , at zero magnetic field we have @xmath237 assuming that the fermi level lies near the center of the electron or hole bands ( @xmath238 ) , we reproduce eq .   for the @xmath52 .",
    "the integration of the second term in eq .   can be extended over all real values of @xmath239 from @xmath240 to @xmath241 .",
    "taking this integral , we arrive finally to the formula   for the gap equation .",
    "equations   for the nel temperatures can be obtained in a similar manner .",
