    "cosmic strings are now a widely recognized part of cosmological theory .",
    "cosmic stings appear naturally in a multitude of inflationary models as topological defects from the early universe ( e.g. @xcite , for more studies see references in @xcite ) .",
    "similar objects commonly referred to as cosmic superstrings can also be produced in fundametal string and m - theories @xcite . in the present study we will not differentiate between the two classes , because their observational signatures considered in this paper are the same .",
    "the key parameter of a cosmic string is its tension @xmath2 , which is assumed to be related to the effective energy scale of the string - producing theory @xmath3 by @xcite @xmath4 earliest theories of string formation placed time of their generation to the grand unification theory epoch and therefore their tension seemed to be of order @xmath5 .",
    "initially , possible tensions of string were constrained from both sides : @xmath6 , but eventually the lower bound was removed and strings with arbitrarily low tension are theoretically allowed now ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "cosmic strings with low tension can solve some astrophysical problems : e.g. , recently , cosmic strings with tensions about @xmath7 were proposed as prominent source of high - energy cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "simulations @xcite suggest the energy fraction in strings has a scaling behavior : their density @xmath8 ( in units of critical density @xmath9 ) does not depend on cosmological time .",
    "recent works suggest that strings contribute a subdominant fraction to the energy balance of the universe @xcite .",
    "this question has not been completely resolved yet .",
    "we will treat @xmath8 essentially as a free parameter and will try to constrain it observationally .",
    "there have been a number of attempts to limit the density of strings from various observational perspectives .",
    "heavy enough strings , if present , would make distinctive imprints on the cosmic microwave background and shapes of distant lensed galaxies ; these techniques indicate absence of strings with @xmath10 in the universe @xcite .",
    "more stringent , though more model - dependent constraints come from pulsar timing ( pt ) : cosmic strings emit gravitational waves and the corresponding background can be detected by usual methods of pt@xcite .",
    "this method rules out any significant presence of cosmic strings with tensions @xmath2 at @xmath11 @xcite . ultimately , planned mission _",
    "lisa _ are expected to test the presence of gravitational wave background from lighter strings with tensions down to @xmath12 .",
    "string network has a complicated structure with a combination of long straight segments and a population of string loops of various lengths @xmath13 that were formed in the interconnections between straight strings .",
    "the loops oscillate relativistically ( @xmath14 ) with an amplitude of order @xmath13 and period @xmath15 , emitting gravitational waves and eventually decaying .",
    "only sufficiently long loops survive by the present time .",
    "recent simulations @xcite show that the surviving large - scale ( @xmath16 and above ) loops of light cosmic strings experience considerable clustering , which closely follows that of the dark matter , albeit with a somewhat lower amplitude . in central parts of large galaxies , such as the milky way",
    ", the loops density can be enhanced by up to @xmath17 relative to its average cosmological value .",
    "this density enhancement significantly boosts the detection rates of experiments sensitive to the local population of lenses @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate how the clustering affects the prospects of detection of local cosmic strings via two observational signatures  lensing on the string as seen in the photometry of background objects and kaiser - stebbins effect affecting the timing of millisecond pulsars .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section  [ depthsection ] , we discuss the expected rate of the effects and lay out a simple formalism with which one can interpret the non - detection of the effect in a given experiment",
    ". then in sections  [ eventphenomena ] and  [ pulsartiming ] we consider lensing and kaiser - stebbins effect in a greater detail and calculate the constraints on the string loop population from existing observations .",
    "the final section discusses the obtained results and offers suggestions for further research .",
    "the first effect we consider is lensing of a background object by the string , in which two identical positive - parity images of the object appear on the sky when it enters a narrow strip along the string ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the width @xmath18 of the strip depends on the tension @xmath2 of the string and the local inclination @xmath19 of the string to the line of sight : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the distances , respectively , from the observer to the source and from the string to the source ( along the line of sight ) . for the presently allowed tensions of the string",
    ", the two images can not be resolved and only an increase in the total brightness of both images is seen as the source traverses the strip .    the second observational signature of our interest is the kaiser - stebbins effect , which stems from the induced doppler shift in the conic space - time around a moving string and results in a discontinuity @xmath23 of the observed frequency @xmath24 of any radiation from the source observed on the either side of the string @xcite .",
    "it is also proportional to the string tension @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are , respectively , the lorentz - factor of the string and the orthogonal ( to the string ) component of its transverse ( to the line of sight ) velocity w.r.t .",
    "the source ( in units of @xmath28 ) . by itself",
    ", this frequency jump is again too low to be observed directly ( e.g. , spectroscopically ) but it can manifest itself in the integrated form of pulsar timing residuals .",
    "both the lensing and kaiser - stebbins effects depend on the crossing of an observed source by a cosmic string .",
    "thus , the probability that a given source if affected by either effect differs from the standard value of @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the optical depth given by the fraction of the sky covered by cosmic strings .",
    "however , @xmath30 is still useful for an estimate of the ( un)importance of strips overlap in lensing .    for cosmic strings @xmath30",
    "is given by summing the contributions of all infinitesimal slices of thickness  @xmath31 within a solid angle  @xmath32 along the line of sight @xmath33 .",
    "each contribution @xmath34 is the fraction of area covered by all strips within the volume @xmath35 relative to the total area of this slice @xmath36 .",
    "the area covered by all strips within the slice is given by their total length @xmath37 times the linear width @xmath38 of strips : @xmath39 given that @xmath40 ( eq.[stripwidth ] ) , @xmath41 is actually independent of @xmath2 : @xmath42 where we used the average @xmath43 and added a subscript ` ol' to @xmath44 to reflect its role in traditional lensing .",
    "equation  ( [ deltadepth ] ) is the same as the optical depth due to a population of point lenses with mass density @xmath45 .",
    "these values have been estimated in a number of works both for the local case of machos in our galaxy and for a hypothetical cosmological population of compact lenses . as long as the density in strings does not exceed that of the dark matter",
    ", we can use the theoretical upper limits from those works to constrain @xmath30 .",
    "the estimates ( @xmath46 for the galaxy and @xmath47 in the cosmological case with source at redshift 1  @xcite ) are significantly below unity .",
    "this allows us to assume that the strips do not significantly overlap in projection and at every given moment every source is affected by just one string at most .    however , the optical depth defined by  ( [ ddepth ] ) is not a measure of the expected rate of events in an observational search for cosmic strings .",
    "the latter is given by how often a given source is crossed by a cosmic string and given that by their very nature strings are extended objects , as they move across the sky they quickly sweep areas much greater than those swept by einstein circles around point lenses with the same optical depth and velocities .",
    "every source swept by a string will split into two parts separated by  ( [ stripwidth ] ) and their combined brightness can jump by up to a factor of 2 while the observed frequency of the source will experience a discontinuity of  ( [ freqshift ] ) .",
    "whether ( and how ) these effects can be detected is a separate question depending on the details of a particular observational survey and discussed in the following .",
    "however , when estimating the optical depth similarly to  ( [ ddepth ] ) , instead of @xmath48 width one should use the width of the strip swept by the cosmic string over the time span @xmath49 of the observational survey ; this is given by @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is some typical value of @xmath27 among strings contributing to the optical depth .",
    "the correct equation for the latter is then are not strictly independent  that is , two neighboring layers most likely either will both have a piece of a string in them or neither will have one . however , assuming that the length of the string is small compared to the distance to the source , one can choose a ` physically infinitesimal ' depth of the layer @xmath31 that will make layers effectively independent .",
    "] @xmath52 which can be made very large by lowering @xmath2 due to the very poor existing lower limits on the string tension .",
    "the probability @xmath53 that a change  in either brightness of frequency of the observed source  occurs in a given source during the observations is @xmath54 .",
    "the model of the experiment we consider is an observational survey searching for either a characteristic transient brightening of the source or a jump in its frequency .",
    "the time span of observations is @xmath49 and the number of sources monitored is @xmath55 .",
    "the cosmic strings population is characterized by its average cosmological density @xmath8 in critical units and tension @xmath2 ( typical length of loops @xmath13 can not be constrained with observations we consider ) .",
    "we assume that the string loops can cluster as suggested in  @xcite with a local enhancement @xmath56 over their average cosmological density @xmath57 so that their local density @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the hubble constant ; we use @xmath56 from  @xcite .",
    "let us now use bayesian inference to see how a non - detection of the effect in the survey constrains the parameters of the strings @xmath60 .",
    "given these parameters , we can calculate the probability that the effect happens in @xmath61-th source : @xmath62 integrating the enhancement @xmath56 along the line of sight .",
    "the probability of actually detecting the effect needs to account for the limited efficiency of any survey . even if the change in brightness or frequency does occur",
    ", we might miss it because the observations are not continuous , the effect is too weak to be observed or can hide in the intrinsic variations of the source .",
    "this is accomplished by multiplying @xmath63 by efficiency factors @xmath64 that measure the probability of detection given that the effect does happen .",
    "assuming that the sources are affected by strings independent of each other , the probability @xmath65 of non - detection in the entire survey is then the product of the probabilities of non - detection in every source @xmath66 which , in the bayesian sense , evaluates to likelihood @xmath67\\right\\}. % \\label{likelihood}\\]]the posterior distribution density of @xmath68 set by the non - detection is then given by the bayes theorem : @xmath69^{-1 } \\label{bayesianconstraing}\\ ] ] where integration in the denominator extends over the parameter space measured by the prior @xmath70 .",
    "alternatively , one can interpret @xmath71 as a scaled probability density of @xmath8 for a fixed @xmath2 so that the probability of string density being less than @xmath72 as a function of @xmath2 is @xmath73^{-1}. \\label{pomega}\\ ] ] efficiencies @xmath64",

    ", a second positive - parity image appears in a ` duplicate ' strip on the other side of the string , the two images separated by @xmath18 . as the source continues its way towards the string , the second image moves away from it until the first image disappears on contact with the string itself ( see upper plots in figure  [ lensingpattern ] ) .",
    "if the two images can not be resolved , which is the case we consider in this paper , neither an astrometric shift in the position of the source on the sky can be detected , and what the observer sees is a temporary increase in the total brightness of the source . for a small enough source that fits into the strip completely , the brightness will increase twofold . for larger sources",

    "light curves for more complex sources would be similar and for sources smaller than the strip width the curve will be the same as in the top left panel of fig .",
    "[ lensingpattern ] except for the precise shape of the ` wings ' leading up to the ` plateau ' .",
    "most importantly , the amplitude ",
    "i.e. , height of the plateau  will be the same , @xmath92 , and this is a distinct photometrical signature for string lensing of small sources ; we are not aware of any other phenomena that produce an exactly twofold increase in brightness naturally .",
    "the time scale @xmath93 of such events is given by the angular velocity @xmath94 of the string with respect to the source in the plane of the sky and is given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 now stands for the overall size of the source in the sky . in summary , one can see that two different regimes of lensing are possible , depending on the size of the source . for",
    "large sources @xmath89 , the amplitude and time scale of the effect depend on the size of the source @xmath97 for small sources @xmath98 , the amplitude saturates while the time scale depends mostly on the string tension : @xmath99 for a rough estimate as to which regime applies based on the observed properties of a thermally radiating uniform source , one can utilize the stefan - boltzmann law to see that the angular size depends on the observed flux and temperature only : @xmath100 .",
    "more accurate estimates need to account for the interstellar absorption and for the actual spectral energy distribution and its overlap with the detector s bandwidth . in astronomical terms",
    ", one can obtain @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the apparent instrumental magnitude of the object , @xmath103 is its effective temperature , @xmath104 is the interstellar absorption and @xmath105 is the bolometric correction .",
    "both @xmath103 and @xmath105 can be estimated from the apparent color of the object while @xmath104 is well mapped in the sky .      for hydrogen - burning , main sequence stars which make up",
    "the majority of the galaxy s stellar population , the linear size @xmath106 varies within roughly @xmath107 and at distances @xmath44 of order 1 pc to 30 kpc this corresponds to angular size @xmath108 ; including white dwarf and red giant stars widens this interval by about an order of magnitude on both ends .",
    "therefore , for strings with @xmath109 both small - source and large - source regimes may be relevant in the case of the galaxy , though numbers tend to point towards the latter case .",
    "the amplitude of the effect could be anywhere from @xmath110 to @xmath111 while the time scales of cosmic string lensing events within the galaxy are rather short .",
    "even in the extreme case , where a red giant of size @xmath112 seen at the far end of the galaxy ( @xmath113 ) is crossed by a string of tension @xmath114 located half - way to the source , application of  ( [ timescale ] ) yields @xmath93 of order an hour . for a more typical case of a main - sequence star at a few hundred pc from the sun",
    "this reduces to tens of seconds or below .",
    "there is some overlap of these estimates with the target sensitivity of exoplanet - hunting missions such as _ corot _ and _ kepler_. their target stars are relatively close to the sun ( @xmath115 for _ kepler _ and @xmath116 for _ corot _ ) , which is small compared to the distance to the galactic center . for our exploratory analysis it is therefore safe to neglect the enhancement factor @xmath56 variation within the volume probed by these stars .",
    "however , its dependence on the assumed strings tension can not be ignored as it spans a range from @xmath117 at @xmath114 to @xmath118 at @xmath119@xcite .",
    "plugging these numbers into  ( [ ddepthsizesweep ] ) and integrating along the line of sight , one obtains @xmath120 where the upper estimate corresponds to the survey parameters characteristic of _ kepler _ ( and high tension of strings with rather conservative consequences for @xmath41 ) and the lower is more relevant to _ corot _ asteroseismology survey ( with @xmath121 close to the middle of the range we consider ) .",
    "the number of target stars is of order @xmath17 for and @xmath122 for so these estimates are not that small especially taking into account that @xmath8 is poorly constrained at present .",
    "however , what is truly crucial here is the accuracy of observations given that the cosmic strings crossings are not recurring events and any detection of strings would be one of those extraordinary claims that , by common wisdom , require extraordinary evidence . as a consequence , the light curve should be measured with high precision and well sampled to allow an unambiguous identification with an event described by  ( [ fluxincrease ] ) .",
    "while the precision of photometry for both missions is very high , the sampling rate of is unlikely to be sufficient for our purpose .",
    "is looking at solar - type stars with @xmath123 and according to  ( [ hugesourceregime ] ) the duration of events is @xmath124 .",
    "_ kepler _ integrates light for @xmath125 and therefore there is no chance to resolve the light curve of the string events , except for an unlikely case of string crossing the star almost in parallel to the string itself is a sensible upper limit to the probability that transverse velocity of the string is less than @xmath27 . ] .",
    "thus , for _ kepler _ targets @xmath126 and this mission has more or less no constraining power with regards to cosmic strings . however , when interpreting light curves of stars in search for planet transits one should keep an open eye to the possibility that an ` anti - transit ' , in which the brightness of the star suddenly increases according to  ( [ fluxincrease ] ) could be caused by a cosmic string rather than a planetary transit .    _",
    "corot _ case seems more promising . in the asteroseismology mode of the satellite",
    ", the brightness of a small number of stars is sampled once a second ( of which @xmath127 is the integration time and the rest is readout etc . ) , although the publicly available data are integrated to @xmath128 exposures , which is optimal for stellar seismology studies .",
    "the targets are relatively bright stars ( @xmath129 ) and despite the short exposure , their brightness is measured to a sufficiently high precision ( from @xmath130 for @xmath131 to @xmath132 for @xmath133 ) at a reliable signal - to - noise of @xmath134 .",
    "this is roughly the range of parameters expected for cosmic string crossings as explained in the first two paragraphs of this subsection .",
    "we therefore proceed to see how a non - detection of such events in the _ corot _ data constrains the parameters of loops .",
    "to do so , we need to specify what we would consider a reliable detection of the event  that is , impose specific ` cuts ' on the parameters of events that would guarantee that it is noticed in the data and not confused with some other effect such as stellar variability .",
    "we choose the following criterion : ( a ) the duration of the event should be at least @xmath135 so that the light curve  ( [ fluxincrease ] ) is sampled at @xmath136 points by the satellite and ( b ) the light curve of the crossing event should be measured with an accuracy allowing to resolve it into at least @xmath137 flux levels at a given signal - to - noise @xmath138 .",
