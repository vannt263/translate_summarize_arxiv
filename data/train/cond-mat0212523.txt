    "in previous studies of _ quasi - condensates _ the basic tools of the theory are an operator @xmath17 giving the density in @xmath18 and an operator @xmath19 giving the phase of @xmath20 , the field operator in @xmath18 , the position @xmath18 being a continuous variable @xcite .",
    "a small parameter of the theory characterizing the regime of _ quasi - condensates _ is then that the density fluctuations , that is the fluctuations of @xmath21 , are small in relative values : @xmath22 however one finds that the expectation value of @xmath23 is infinite in every point with a non - vanishing mean density @xmath24 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , the value of the dirac distribution at the origin , is infinite , and the second term in the right hand side , giving the probability density of finding two atoms in the same point of space , is finite in any realistic model .",
    "mathematically this divergence is due to the use of the bosonic commutation relations of the field operators @xmath20 and @xmath27 in the same point of space to put the atomic field product in normal order .    in order to have small , and therefore finite , density fluctuations ,",
    "one is forced to discretize the space , that is to collect the particles in little boxes at the nodes of a spatial grid .",
    "each little box has equal length @xmath0 along each dimension of space and is parameterized by the position @xmath18 of its center .",
    "the field operator @xmath20 has the effect of removing a particle in the box at position @xmath18 and it now satisfies the bosonic commutation relations : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the discrete kronecker delta and @xmath30 is the dimension of space .",
    "the variance of the operator giving the density is now finite : @xmath31 in the validity domain of the theoretical approach of this paper , this variance will be much smaller than @xmath32 because both the term on the first line of the right hand side and the term on the second line are small : @xmath33      in usual continuous space theories an hermitian field phase operator @xmath19 is introduced subject to the following commutation relation with the operator giving the density : @xmath34 = i\\delta(\\rb-\\rbp).\\ ] ] in our discrete model the desired commutation relation is modified into @xmath34 = i\\frac{\\delta_{\\rb,\\rbp}}{l^d}. \\label{commut}\\ ] ]    first we recall briefly that there exists actually no hermitian operator @xmath19 satisfying strictly the above commutation relation . from the identity ( [ commut ] ) one can indeed show that the operator @xmath35 where @xmath36 is any real number , is a translation operator for the density @xcite : @xmath37 this identity contradicts two fundamental properties of @xmath21 , the positiveness and the discreteness of its spectrum @xcite .",
    "we now proceed with the construction of a phase operator @xmath19 approximately satisfying the commutation relation ( [ commut ] ) .",
    "the key ingredients allowing such an approximate construction are ( i ) to be in the limit of a large occupation number of the considered box of the lattice , and ( ii ) to construct the operator @xmath38 first , which , according to ( [ transla ] ) taken with @xmath39 , simply reduces the number of particles in the considered box by one .    in each spatial box",
    "we introduce the basis of fock states @xmath40 with exactly @xmath41 particles in the box . in this basis",
    "the field operators have the following matrix elements : @xmath42 as a consequence of the commutation relation ( [ commu1 ] ) .",
    "the atomic density @xmath43 defined by @xmath44 is diagonal in the fock state basis : @xmath45 we then introduce the operator @xmath46 defined by : @xmath47 in the fock space @xmath48 reduces by one the number of particles @xmath41 in the box @xmath18 : @xmath49 note that its action on the vacuum state of the box gives zero . for each box @xmath18",
    ", the definition of @xmath46 leads to the exact relations : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the identity operator and @xmath52 is the zero - particle state or vacuum state in the box of center @xmath18 .",
    "we find that the operator @xmath46 is almost unitary , _",
    "i.e. _ it is effectively unitary for a physical state of the system with a negligible probability of having an empty box . in what follows",
    ", we assume that this condition is satisfied , so that the projector @xmath53 can be neglected : @xmath54    in this case , we write the approximately unitary operator @xmath46 as : @xmath55 which amounts to writing the field operator as : @xmath56 this should be understood as a formal writing , allowing for example to recover the matrix elements of @xmath46 and therefore of the field operator @xmath57 from the commutation relation ( [ commut ] ) .",
    "we summarize below all the commutation relations of our phase - density representation : @xmath58    we come back to the constraint ( [ cond_proba ] ) at the basis of the construction of @xmath59 . a sufficient condition to have a low probability for a zero particle occupation in a box",
    "is obtained for a large mean number of particles in the box and with small relative particle number fluctuations .",
    "this is the regime that we wish to consider in this paper .",
    "we are therefore back to the discussion of the previous subsection and to the conditions ( [ conda],[condb ] ) for weak density fluctuations . in particular",
    ", the construction of the operator @xmath59 becomes problematic in the limit @xmath60 , that is in the continuous model .",
    "working on a grid can be also seen as performing a coarse - grain average over all physical quantities on a scale @xmath0 .",
    "this averaging suppresses the short wavelength modes ( shorter than @xmath0 ) and thus introduces an energy cutoff : @xmath61 this cutoff is of no physical consequence if all characteristic energies ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) are smaller , i.e. , that @xmath0 is smaller than the corresponding characteristic lengths .",
    "this leads , for instance , to the following restrictions for @xmath0 : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the healing length , and @xmath66 is the thermal de broglie wavelength .",
    "these two restrictions , combined with eq .",
    "( [ condb ] ) , impose : @xmath67 these are conditions of validity for our discrete model .    the first one , eq .",
    "( [ temp ] ) , is the quantum degeneracy regime occurring at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "the second restriction , eq . ( [ inter ] ) , corresponds to the regime of weakly interacting systems .",
    "its dependence on the density varies according to the dimension of space . in 1d and 3d ,",
    "the mean field prediction for the chemical potential is @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a constant characterizing the interaction potential , the so - called coupling constant . in 1d , eq.([inter ] ) is the high density limit where a mean field theory is valid ; we recall that the small density limit @xmath70 corresponds to the strongly interacting ( or strongly correlated ) tonks gas regime . in 3d , the effective coupling constant @xmath69",
    "is related to the @xmath71-wave scattering length @xmath72 of the interaction potential , @xmath73 , so that @xmath74 : one recovers the usual small gaseous parameter @xmath75 . in 2d , the chemical potential scales as @xmath76 where @xmath72 is the scattering length of the 2d interaction potential so that the condition @xmath77 results in a low density condition , @xmath78 .",
    "in our lattice model , we represent the binary interaction potential among the particles by a discrete delta potential : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the bare coupling constant . note that @xmath80 in general differs from the effective coupling constant @xmath69 , and we shall come back to this point in section [ etat ] . with this model potential ,",
    "the grand canonical hamiltonian is : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is an external trapping potential and where the laplacian is a symmetric operator coupling the different neighboring boxes : @xmath83 the @xmath84 are the unitary vectors and @xmath85 the different orthogonal space directions ( for example , @xmath86 in 3d ) . as usual",
    "we take periodic boundary conditions inside a rectangular box with lengths integer multiple of @xmath0 .",
    "we now rewrite the hamiltonian in the density - phase representation , that is in term of the operators @xmath10 and @xmath9 giving the density and the phase as defined in the previous section .",
    "the contributions of the trapping potential and of the interaction potential to the hamiltonian are local in real space and therefore include the operator @xmath10 only : @xmath87   \\label{pot}\\ ] ] where we have used the bosonic commutation relation ( [ commu1 ] ) to exchange one of the @xmath88 with @xmath57 in the interaction term .",
    "the kinetic energy term involves explicitly the phase operator : @xmath89 where we have introduced the notations @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "a remarkable property of this writing , to be used below , is that it involves only the difference of two phase operators between two neighboring points of the lattice .",
    "we now expand the hamiltonian to third order in powers of two small parameters .",
    "as already discussed in subsection [ subsec : why ] the regime of quasi - condensates that we are interested in corresponds to small relative fluctuations @xmath13 of the density . in the zeroth order approach totally neglecting the density fluctuations , the density is set to a deterministic value @xmath12 , as we shall see .",
    "the second order expansion allows us to describe the density fluctuations : @xmath92 the third order expansion allows us to calculate the mean value of @xmath93 .",
    "the first small parameter of the systematic expansion used in this paper is therefore given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the typical value of the operator @xmath13 in the physical state of the system .",
    "mathematically this allows to expand @xmath96 as @xmath97 the second small parameter of the expansion is given by @xmath98 here @xmath99 represents the gradient on the lattice : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is an arbitrary function .",
    "physically the existence of the small parameter @xmath102 is reasonable : it is at the basis of our hypothesis that the continuous quantum field problem can be well approximated by a discrete lattice model , provided that @xmath0 is small enough , see subsection [ subsec : how ] .",
    "mathematically this second small parameter allows to expand in ( [ hkin ] ) the exponentials of the phase differences : @xmath103    from the fact that the discretisation length @xmath0 is on the order of the smallest of the two macroscopic length scales @xmath104 and @xmath105 , see ( [ restriction ] ) , it will be checked later that the parameters @xmath106 and @xmath102 , though of an apparently different physical origin , can be chosen to be of the same order of magnitude , @xmath107 and can therefore be treated mathematically as infinitesimals of the same order .",

    "we now solve perturbatively , order by order , the hamiltonian problems defined by @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 . to zeroth order in @xmath115 , the hamiltonian is a c - number .",
    "as the chemical potential is fixed in our approach , @xmath112 is minimized for a density profile @xmath116 such that @xmath117 solves the discrete version of the gross - pitaevskii equation : @xmath118 \\sqrt{\\rho_0 } = 0.\\ ] ] this density profile constitutes the zeroth order approximation to the density @xmath119 .",

    "it will however turn out to be more convenient to parameterize the theory in terms of @xmath120 rather than in terms of @xmath62 .",
    "we will therefore consider @xmath62 and @xmath12 as functions of @xmath120 : @xmath123 @xmath124 is therefore the gross - pitaevskii prediction for the chemical potential of a gas of @xmath120 particles .",
    "for the choice of density profile ( [ fond ] ) , the first order correction @xmath125 to the hamiltonian vanishes .",
    "we therefore have now to solve the hamiltonian problem defined by @xmath111 , in order to determine the lowest order approximation to the density fluctuation @xmath13 and the phase @xmath9 .",
    "it is instructive to write the corresponding heisenberg equations of motion , which are linear ( and therefore trivially solvable ) since @xmath111 is quadratic .",

    "this mapping therefore allows to reuse the standard diagonalisation of the bogoliubov hamiltonian .",

    "this is the sum of uncoupled harmonic oscillators , plus a massive free degree of freedom corresponding to the unbound phase variable @xmath150 .",
    "the effective mass of the phase variable is given by @xmath160 .",
    "the energy functional @xmath161 $ ] will be calculated in [ gse ] , where it will be shown that it leads to exactly the same ground state energy as the number conserving bogoliubov theory .",
    "this shows that the bogoliubov theory can be used to calculate the ground state energy even for e.g. 1d quasi - condensates , a fact commonly used in the literature @xcite but which looks rather heuristic in the absence of justification .      the physics contained in the cubic term @xmath162 of the hamiltonian is very rich .",
    "it includes interaction effects between the bogoliubov modes of the previous section , allowing a generalization to quasi - condensates of the theory of energy shifts and beliaev - landau damping usually put forward for bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "we are more modest here .",
    "our motivation to include the cubic corrections is that the quadratic hamiltonian @xmath111 brings actually no correction to the zeroth order approximation @xmath12 to the mean density , since the mean value of @xmath13 vanishes at the level of the second order theory .",
    "this is highly non satisfactory as it brings some inconsistency in the calculation of an observable like @xmath15 , the first order correlation function of the field : to get a non - trivial prediction for @xmath15 one has to include terms quadratic in the phase operator , which are second order in @xmath102 , which forces to also include second order corrections to the mean density , as will become very explicit in section [ application ] .",
    "we therefore calculate the first order correction to the equations of motion of @xmath13 and @xmath9 due to the cubic hamiltonian term @xmath162 , and we take the average over the quantum state corresponding to the density operator at thermal equilibrium for the hamiltonian @xmath111 .",

    "<S> we present an extension of the well - known bogoliubov theory to treat low dimensional degenerate bose gases in the limit of weak interactions and low density fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we use a density - phase representation and show that a precise definition of the phase operator requires a space discretisation in cells of size @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a systematic expansion of the hamiltonian in terms of two small parameters , the relative density fluctuations inside a cell and the phase change over a cell . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting macroscopic observables can be computed in one , two and three dimensions with no ultraviolet or infrared divergence . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore this approach exactly matches bogoliubov s approach when there is a true condensate . </S>",
    "<S> we give the resulting expressions for the equation of state of the gas , the ground state energy , the first order and second order correlations functions of the field . </S>",
    "<S> explicit calculations are done for homogeneous systems .    </S>",
    "<S> recent progresses in the realization of low - dimensional bose gases in the quantum degenerate regime offer new perspectives for the comparison with theoretical treatments . in atomic bose gases , </S>",
    "<S> low - dimensional systems are achieved by creating anisotropic trapping potentials . </S>",
    "<S> bose - einstein condensates of reduced dimensionality , that is with the atomic motion frozen in the harmonic oscillator ground state along one or two directions , have been produced @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> low - dimensional bose gases have been the subject of early theoretical studies . in the thermodynamical limit for spatially homogeneous systems , the mermin - wagner - hohenberg theorem @xcite excludes the formation of a bose - einstein condensate at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this is physically due to large phase fluctuations which restrict the coherence length of the bosonic field to a finite value . </S>",
    "<S> one expects however that strong enough repulsive interactions between the particles strongly reduces the density fluctuations of the gas in contrast to the non - interacting case @xcite . in this context , </S>",
    "<S> popov introduced a long time ago the concept of _ quasi - condensate _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this concept has been extended to trapped gases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the recent observation of large phase fluctuations for a degenerate bose gas in a highly anisotropic cigar shaped trap has brought a qualitative experimental confirmation of the theory in a quasi one - dimensional geometry @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the theory of quasi - condensates has not reached yet the maturity of the theory for condensates . in the case of regular 3d bose - einstein condensation in the weakly interacting regime , </S>",
    "<S> the bogoliubov theory @xcite , based on a systematic expansion in a small parameter , gives a very precise description of the state of the gas . </S>",
    "<S> the intuitive idea of the bogoliubov theory is to use the existence of a single macroscopically occupied mode @xmath1 of the field , the mode of the condensate . </S>",
    "<S> we recall here the @xmath2-symmetry preserving version of the theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one first splits the bosonic field operator as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 annihilates a particle in the condensate mode and @xmath5 accounts for quantum and thermal fluctuations in the other modes . </S>",
    "<S> then one uses the assumption @xmath6 to solve perturbatively the field equations of motion . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is not suitable for a _ quasi - condensate _ as there is no single macroscopically occupied field mode . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , in the case of weak density fluctuations , the bogoliubov idea can still be adapted in a quantum phase - density representation of the field operator . </S>",
    "<S> one writes the field operator @xmath7 as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are position dependent operators giving the phase and the density . </S>",
    "<S> one then splits the operator giving the density as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a c - number and @xmath13 are fluctuations , and one uses the fact that @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> this idea has already been used in the literature @xcite but to our knowledge without a precise definition of the phase operator , a well - known delicate point of quantum field theory @xcite . as a consequence of the non - rigorous definition of the phase , divergences appear in the theory @xcite : one has to introduce an arbitrary energy cut - off , so that predictions in 1d at zero temperature are made within a logarithmic accuracy only , and in 3d there is no full equivalence with the bogoliubov theory . another approach based on the current - density operator rather than on the phase operator </S>",
    "<S> is given by schwartz @xcite : an expansion of the hamiltonian in terms of weak density and current fluctuations is performed relating the correlation function of the field to the static structure factor . </S>",
    "<S> it is subject to the same divergence problem in 2d and 3d in the absence of energy cut - off if one calculates the structure factor in the bogoliubov approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> a possibility to circumvent these difficulties is to rely on the path integral formulation of quantum field theory , which involves a functional integral over a classical field , for which the phase is perfectly well defined . </S>",
    "<S> this is the approach used by popov , but with the introduction of an energy cut - off much smaller than the chemical potential of the gas , so that the physics at length scales smaller than the healing length is not accurately described . </S>",
    "<S> this functional integral approach has recently been revisited @xcite : it can lead to a cut - off independent formalism for quasi - condensates . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions of @xcite have the unsatisfactory feature of not reproducing exactly the same results as the bogoliubov theory for a 3d condensate , but this has been corrected in an erratum @xcite .    in this paper , we propose a new improved bogoliubov approach to treat _ quasi - condensates _ in the phase - density formalism for a weakly - interacting bose gas . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is based on a lattice model , that is with discrete spatial modes , which allows to give a careful definition of the phase operator of the field and to introduce from the start an energy cut - off . </S>",
    "<S> it uses a systematic expansion in powers of the density fluctuations and of the spatial phase gradient and leads to simple expressions for the first order and the second order spatial correlation functions of the bosonic field that do not depend on the energy cut - off and that exactly reproduces in 3d the predictions of the bogoliubov theory . </S>",
    "<S> we also use this formalism to determine the equation of state of the gas to the lowest non - vanishing order in the thermal and quantum excitations .    in section [ secnew ] , </S>",
    "<S> we construct a discretized space model in order to define in a precise way the operators giving the phase and the density . </S>",
    "<S> we give the physical implications of the space discretization , restricting this approach to highly degenerate and weakly interacting bose systems . in section [ modes ] , we derive a quadratic approximation to the hamiltonian , that is we derive approximate linear equations of motion for the density fluctuations and the phase operators . </S>",
    "<S> we recover to the lowest order the gross - pitaevskii equation for the _ quasi - condensate _ density and we recover the bogoliubov spectrum for the excitations . </S>",
    "<S> we also push the expansion to the next order , by producing a cubic correction to the quadratic hamiltonian , including the interaction between the _ quasi - condensate _ and the excitations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that inclusion of this correction is necessary to get a consistent theory and to establish the full equivalence between our approach and the number conserving bogoliubov theory . in section [ application ] , we present a few applications of our formalism : we give general formulas for the equation of state and the ground state of the gas , and for the first order and second order correlation functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the field operator . in section [ homogene ] </S>",
    "<S> , we apply our formal results to the homogeneous bose gas in various dimensions of space . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to derive simply the validity condition of the method and to compare with existing results in the literature . </S>"
