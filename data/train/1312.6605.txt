    "a phonon ( q ) and its fs piece ( k ,- k ) opens the gap over a part of the dos , @xmath53 , of the total @xmath54 . assuming that the 26 highest symmetry directions are representative for a 3d lattice we get 26 individual gap equations for the 6 [ 1,0,0 ] , the 12 [ 1,1,0 ] and the 8 [ 1,1,1 ] directions if the fs is a sphere , or more if there are multiple fs of complicated shapes .",

    "[ figcirc]b can be reduced to only 2 phonons spanning the entire fs . in the end",
    "there is a balance between the total elastic energy and the total gain of electronic energy . in the following we show several examples where the fs s are simple , so that only few phonons contribute to the total elastic energy , which therefore will be advantageous to superconductivity",
    "the first example is given by the low-@xmath1 superconductivity in weakly electron - doped semiconductors na@xmath55wo@xmath5 and nb@xmath55srti@xmath56o@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the 3d bandstructures of the undoped materials show wide band gaps typical of semiconductors @xcite , but they become metallic through na or nb impurity doping .",
    "superconductivity is surprising here , since the dos and @xmath2 are small .",
    "the electron density is less than 0.01 @xmath57 per formula unit , @xmath58 , at optimal @xmath1 @xcite , when from band theory @xmath59 and the standard @xmath2 will hardly be larger than 0.02 , which is insufficient for a detectable @xmath1 at normal metallic screening conditions @xcite .",
    "the rigid - band model describes correctly the band structure and the fs ( cf . fig [ figcirc]a ) of nb@xmath55srti@xmath60o@xmath5 , with small electron pockets centered at @xmath61 @xcite . a debye spectrum , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the sound velocity , is appropriate for small - q phonons , and @xmath64 in 3d , where @xmath65 is the debye cutoff at large q @xcite .",
    "since the fs diameter ( @xmath66 ) is small , only low - energy phonons with @xmath67 will contribute , and    @xmath68    this makes @xmath69 very small , much smaller than if all phonons up to @xmath65 had to be excited for having a gap over the fs pocket .",
    "hence , @xmath70 in eq .",
    "[ eqlog ] can be sufficiently large for a reasonable @xmath1 despite the smallness of @xmath54 .",
    "another seemingly unexplained fact is that if @xmath71 increases also @xmath0 and the standard @xmath2 increase , so @xmath72 should go up with @xmath71 . instead , @xmath73 for larger doping @xcite",
    "this can be understood from the behavior of @xmath54 and @xmath69 as function of @xmath71 ; the free - electron like dos of srtio@xmath5 @xmath74 increases as @xmath75 for @xmath76 , the energy relative to the bottom of the conduction band , thus @xmath77 @xcite . but phonons in eq . [ eqomegad ]",
    "contribute up to @xmath78 , and since @xmath79 this makes @xmath80 .",
    "thus , the advantage of a low @xmath69 at low doping disappears if @xmath4 increases through electron doping when the ratio @xmath81 becomes smaller .",
    "a similar mechanism is applicable to boron - doped diamond , although it is now a question of hole doping below the band gap .",
    "a @xmath82 was reported when the hole density is near 4.6 @xmath83 @xcite , or about 0.026 holes / atom .",
    "the explanation of this @xmath1 is often based on phonon softening that accompanies the b doping together with a moderate @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "an inspection of the bands for hole doping as in fig .",
    "[ figbnd ] shows that the fs consists of 3 @xmath61 centered pieces , see fig .",
    "many phonon excitations are possible for @xmath84 of the @xmath85 distance .",
    "umklapp transitions are possible for still larger @xmath86 , and they become more frequent if the doping increases .",
    "the factor @xmath45 for reducing the phonon average is not as small as in section iii - a , but the situation is qualitatively the same , and the benefits from few phonon excitations are lost quite soon if the doping increases",
    ".    an interesting situation appears if electron - doping can be made in diamond .",
    "[ figbnd ] shows the possibility for an electron pocket at 3/4 of the @xmath87 distance if electron doping doping is made .",
    "doped diamond is not an ionic material , and the matrix element @xmath11 is dominated by dipole scattering , @xmath88 , which can be calculated directly from the band structure by use of the rigid muffin - tin approximation ( rmta ) @xcite such calculations with rigid - band shifts of @xmath4 show that the matrix element @xmath89 is 40 percent larger for a doping of 0.03 electrons / atom than for 0.03 holes / atom , see table i. this is partly due to a moderate amount of d - states in the upper band , which permits an enhanced p - d scattering .",
    "the @xmath90-character of the electron - pocket state is otherwise quite similar to the s - p states near the hole - pocket states at @xmath61 .",
    "the electron - doped fs is made up by small pockets on the 6 @xmath87 lines , as shown in fig [ cdfs ] .",
    "small-@xmath86 scattering within these pockets is possible , but with limited importance because of their small fraction of the total @xmath44 . in addition , screening will diminish the matrix elements for the very long wave lengths of these waves .",
    "few large @xmath91 scatterings between the pockets ( @xmath86-vectors of type @xmath92 $ ] and @xmath93 $ ] ) are possible together with their umklapp scatterings .",
    "as a whole these are fewer @xmath86-excitations than for the hole - doped fs . therefore , larger matrix elements together with fewer phonon excitations suggest that electron doped diamond is more promising for a high @xmath1 than with hole doping .",
    "this assumes that substitutions of c with n can be made , and that rigid - band conditions prevail .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one could suspect that also other electron - doped semiconductors of diamond structure are interesting for superconductivity , at least if their matrix elements are comparable .",

    "the minimum is at the @xmath99-point and gaas has a direct gap .",
    "electron doping in the latter system forms a continuous fs pocket around the @xmath61 point , which invokes multi - directional @xmath100-phonons with small amplitudes , as for hole - doped diamond . in the former case",
    "the scattering is not only within @xmath99-pockets , but also for intermediate @xmath86-amplitudes between the pockets .",
    "however , the calculated matrix elements are much lower in the small - gap semiconductors than for diamond , see table i for equivalent levels of hole and electron doping .",

    "the latter is for ge more promising than hole doping , as is concluded from the matrix elements , but they are still too small in comparison to the @xmath89-values for diamond to be interesting for enhanced superconductivity .",

    "[ figcirc ] .",
    "they are more complicated than the semiconductors because multiple phonon energies exist for the large unit cells .",
    "phonons with @xmath86-vectors along @xmath106 are not much involved in the absence of nesting in this direction .",
    "ideally only phonons with @xmath86-vectors along the 4 [ 1,0 ] and 4 [ 1,1 ] directions would contribute , which is already a large reduction compared to the 3d lattice .",
    "another profitable case is if a single phonon would be able to open the gap at several fs - pieces .",
    "this will be the case when the 2d fs cylinder distorts into a `` diamond''-shaped fs , as it does in the cuprates when the hole doping is increased to about 0.15 holes / cu , see case `` b '' in fig .",
    "[ figcirc ] .",
    "the fermi energy then reaches the dos peak caused by the van - hove singularity ( vhs ) and @xmath54 goes up , which also increases @xmath2 and @xmath1 , but in addition ; the cost in elastic energy is reduced further when only 2 q - vectors ( with multiple @xmath107 ) are scanning two sets of parallel fs sheets .",
    "this case at optimal doping is characterized by a reduced number of excited phonon / spinwave excitations compared to the over- or under - doped cases . from the reduced number of phonons , @xmath108 , which translates into an increase in @xmath2 by a factor of @xmath109 and @xmath1",

    "it is likely that the softening can be tempered by spin - phonon coupling .",
    "the reason is that spin - wave excitation energies are usually higher than phonon energies , so `` in - phase '' mixing of spin waves into a phonon will push the energy of the latter upwards .",

    "this is quite close to the idealized nested fs of fig .",
    "[ figcirc]b . for even higher hole doping , at `` over doping '' , the fs takes a barrel - like shape again , but now centered at the @xmath61-point .",
    "one idea for having a more nested 2d fs ( at an optimal hole doping when the 2d projected fs is rather straight and the band is near the vhs ) with less @xmath113 dispersion is to cut the orbital overlap along @xmath106 between cu - d and apical o - p states .",
    "removing apical oxygens would be one possibility , but it also increases the electron doping according to calculations @xcite .",
    "it is interesting , but not fully understood , that o - deficient ba@xmath111cuo@xmath114 ( bco ) and sr@xmath111cuo@xmath114 ( sco ) , which are of the same structure as lco , can have a much higher @xmath1 than lsco @xcite .",

    "moreover , the absence of one o - layer is expected to diminish the already small orbital overlap along @xmath106 , and hence to make the fs even more uniform along @xmath113 than in doped lco .",

    "the three fs cuts for different @xmath113 fall on top of each other , which is not the case for lco .",
    "the @xmath0 at the vhs s of the two cases are comparable ( 23.5 and 25.2 states / cell / ry for bco and lco , respectively ) , and can not explain the large difference in @xmath1 between the two systems . therefore , it is suggested that the almost perfect nesting of the fs for bco makes @xmath1 larger .",

    "many of the energy - costly non - nested modes will be excluded if the wide diagonal fs in fig .",
    "[ figfsb ] can be shortened into a short bar halfway between the end points .",

    "there are recent efforts to understand the role of ordering of defects in the cuprates , since it also tends to open up pseudogaps near the x- and y - points of the fs @xcite .",

    "fewer phonon excitations and larger matrix elements suggest higher @xmath1 with electron doping than with hole doping .",
    "it is tempting to suggest that weakly doped si , ge or gaas could have a comparable @xmath1 , since their fs shapes are similar to that of doped diamond .",
    "however , the matrix elements are significantly smaller . for the layered",
    "cuprates it is possible that the 2d - shaped fs implies a large reduction of the energy for phonon / spin excitations in the superconducting process , so that @xmath1 can be high despite the modest @xmath0 . very similar electronic structures in optimally doped la@xmath111cuo@xmath112 and ba@xmath111cuo@xmath114 , but less warping of the fs and much higher observed @xmath1 in the latter support this hypothesis .",
