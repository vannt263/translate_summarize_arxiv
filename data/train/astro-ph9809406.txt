    "the munics project has four main goals : 1 ) determine the space density of @xmath12 @xmath3 1 clusters ; 2 ) measure large - scale structure at redshifts @xmath13 0.5 ; 3 ) test the number density evolution of elliptical galaxies ; 4 ) select a sample of large@xmath12 elliptical galaxies for populations studies . the basic observational set - up and some preliminary results",
    "were described in @xcite .",
    "we describe below the preliminary results on the clustering properties of k@xmath0 @xmath3 19.5 mag galaxies for three subsamples : 1 ) seven `` empty '' high - galactic latitude fields , 2 ) five fields containing @xmath14 0.5 radio - loud quasars with steep - spectra , i.e. , with spectral indices ( as derived from the ratio of the fluxes at the 11cm- and 6cm - bands ) , of @xmath15 @xmath16 0.6 and 3 ) eight fields containing @xmath14 0.5 radio - loud quasars with flat spectra , with @xmath15 @xmath17 0.6 .",
    "the quasars were chosen from @xcite and the criteria used for their selection were that they have @xmath13 0.5 , their galactic latitude be @xmath18 @xmath16 40 degrees , to avoid heavy star contamination and they be detected at 6 cm and 11 cm .",
    "the k@xmath0 images used in this study were taken at the 3.5m - tel at calar alto with the omega camera .",
    "the typical usable area for each field was 40 arcmin@xmath4 .",
    "a measurement of the degree of galaxy clustering in our fields can be made by determining their projected 2-point correlation function , i.e. , the angular 2-point correlation function , @xmath10(@xmath11 ) .",
    "this is generally fit by a power law of slope 0.8 and amplitude given by integration of limber s equation for the 3-d 2-point correlation function over the galaxy redshift distribution .",
    "we calculate the galaxy angular correlation function for the three subsamples and the complete sample of 20 fields using the formula @xmath10(@xmath11)=(dd2dr@xmath19rr)/rr @xcite , where for a given angle separation dd is the number of galaxy pairs in our data sample , dr is the number of pairs between the data and a uniform random sample and rr is the number of random pairs .",
    "we calculate @xmath10(@xmath11 ) between 3.6@xmath2 and 63.0@xmath2 in log bins of width 0.25 .",
    "the fitted @xmath10(@xmath11 ) amplitudes at @xmath11 = 1 degree , assuming a @xmath20 power - law for the radio / steep - source , radio / flat - source and empty fields and for the combined sample are given in table 1 .",
    "the corresponding plots for the three subsamples are shown in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "the correlation function was determined for each field individually and the plotted values are the averages over the fields .",
    "the error bars indicate the rms scatter between the fields .",
    "the 1@xmath7 error in the mean is comparable to the symbol sizes . to account for the field sizes we calculate an integral constraint ( ic ) assuming that the form of @xmath10(@xmath11 ) is given by a power law with a slope of 0.8 .",
    "the solid lines in figs . 1 and 2 correspond to the best least - squares fits to the function a(@xmath20  13.5 ) where the value for the amplitude a is given in table 1 and the average ic is 13.5 @xmath9 1",
    ". only angular separations for which the ic is @xmath1 50% the raw correlation function are considered .",
    "the error on a was estimated from the field - to - field scatter derived by fitting @xmath10(@xmath11 ) of the individual fields .",
    "the correlation function of galaxies in the k@xmath0 band as a function of limiting magnitude is not well determined mainly due to the small sizes ( @xmath1 2@xmath0 ",
    "3@xmath0 on a side ) of the nir detectors which have not allowed wide - field k@xmath0 imaging surveys to be performed .",
    "this will certainly change with the several wide - field ongoing or planned surveys ( see this conference ) .",
    "we summarize in table 2 the results of the four studies ( including ours ) which have derived the k@xmath0 band correlation functions to date .",
    "we list amplitudes normalized to @xmath11 = 1 degree and their 1@xmath7 errors .",
    "as can be seen in table 2 , the @xmath10(@xmath11 ) amplitude derived in this study from 800 arcmin@xmath4 is similar to that estimated by @xcite for 17 fields covering a total of 101.5 arcmin@xmath4 , each containing a radio - galaxy at @xmath21 1.1 , for a similar magnitude limit .",
    "our results are within the values expected from models of stable clustering with @xmath22 = 0 @xcite .",
    "further discussion of these results is deferred to a later paper .",
    "we also find a marginally significant 2@xmath7 enhancement on the clustering amplitude by a factor of 2.0  2.5 for fields with steep - spectra radio - loud quasars , as compared to the fields with no quasars ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this result has , however , a weak significance and must await confirmation for a larger sample .",
    "if this is correct it could be interpreted as an extension of the effect already observed for quasars at lower redshifts .",
