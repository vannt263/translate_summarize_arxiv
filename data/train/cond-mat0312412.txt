    "ratchet - like motion , whereby directed transport is obtained from nonequilibrium fluctuations , is important in many areas of scientific and technological interest , such as , molecular motors in biology and particle separation on nano- and microscales @xcite .",
    "recently , the problem of horizontal transport in a granular layer vertically vibrated by an asymmetric base has also been considered , both experimentally @xcite and computationally @xcite .",
    "these so - called `` granular ratchets '' have been shown to exhibit interesting dynamical features akin to those found in brownian - motor models .    in the present paper",
    "we approach the problem of granular ratchets by considering the dynamics of a single grain bouncing off a vertically vibrating sawtooth - shaped base .",
    "the model proposed here is a generalization of a previous model studied by some of us @xcite for the gravity - driven motion of a particle on an inclined rough surface with a staircase profile . in the present case ,",
    "the ` rough surface ' has a sawtooth shape with a horizontal baseline and is subjected to a vertical vibration .",
    "we find that , in spite of its simplicity , our single - particle model is able to reproduce some of the generic behaviors observed in experiments @xcite and computer simulations @xcite of granular ratchets , such as horizontal transport and current reversals .",
    "the main results of the paper are summarized in a phase diagram indicating the regions in parameter space where the different dynamical regimes ( no current , normal current , and current reversal ) can be observed .",
    "= 8 cm        our granular ratchet model consists of a particle bouncing off a vibrating sawtooth - like surface whose ` teeth ' have a vertical height @xmath0 and a horizontal length @xmath1 , as shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "a particle is launched with given initial velocity over the vibrating ratchet and then moves around through a succession of ballistic flights and inelastic collisions .",
    "we adopt a simple collision rule given by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are respectively the velocity components tangential and normal to the collision plane , with prime denoting post - collisional velocities , and @xmath6 is the coefficient of restitution . we assume furthermore that the sawtooth vibrates vertically with constant speed @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the vibration amplitude and @xmath9 its period . for simplicity , we consider that @xmath8 ( and hence @xmath9 ) is negligibly small , so that the sawtooth base remains essentially at the same height , which allows us to determine explicitly the successive points of collision between the particle and the ratchet .",
    "the drawback here is that the effect of the vibration on the particle velocity is taken into account in a _",
    "probabilistic _ fashion , as will be discussed later .",
    "we believe , however , that the dynamics seen in our model is quite robust and should not be significantly altered if we consider a fully deterministic model .",
    "suppose now that the particle takes off with velocity @xmath10 from a point @xmath11 , which can be either on the sawtooth left edge ( inclined ramp ) or on its right edge ( vertical wall ) . for convenience , we place our system of coordinates in such a way that the @xmath12 axis is aligned with the inclined ramp and the @xmath13 axis makes an angle @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , with the vertical direction ; see fig .",
    "( by convention , at each new flight we translate our system of coordinates to the tooth from which the particle departs . )",
    "our goal then is to determine the next departure point @xmath16 and the corresponding takeoff velocity @xmath17 , so that the model dynamics can be described by a map @xmath18    to this end , let us introduce the following dimensionless variables @xcite @xmath19 and the dimensionless roughness parameter @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "hereafter we drop the capital notation with the understanding that we shall work solely with dimensionless quantities .",
    "let us now define the jump number @xmath25 in such a way that its modulus equals the number of teeth the particle skips during the flight , with the convention that @xmath26 is positive if the particle moves in the direction of the positive @xmath12 axis . to calculate @xmath26",
    ", we must first determine the points ( if any ) where the particle trajectory crosses the line @xmath27 , connecting the tips of the sawteeth ( the dashed line in fig .  1 ) .",
    "let @xmath28 be the @xmath13 coordinates of these two crossing points ( if they exist ) .",
    "an easy calculation shows @xcite that @xmath29 if @xmath30 $ ] ( including the case where there is no real root ) then the particle does not cross the line @xmath27 and hence @xmath31 . on the other hand , if @xmath32 $ ] then the jump number is determined by the second crossing point @xmath33 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 denotes the ceiling function ( i.e. , the smallest integer greater than @xmath12 ) .",
    "having thus determined @xmath26 , we then need to find the point at which the particle hits the surface .",
    "note that if the particle jumps to the right then it can land only on a ramp , but if the jump is to the left then the particle can hit either a ramp or a vertical wall .",
    "let us first consider the case when the particle lands on a ramp .",
    "_ collision with a ramp .",
    "_ let @xmath36 denote the collision point and @xmath37 the particle velocity prior to the collision . using the kinematics of ballistic motion and the fact that @xmath38 , one obtains after a simple calculation that @xmath39 if the particle jumps to the left ( this happens when @xmath40 ) , the condition @xmath41 must also be satisfied ,",
    "otherwise the particle would have hit a vertical wall ( this case will be treated below ) .",
    "on the assumption that the particle lands on the @xmath26-th ramp , the new departure point @xmath16 and the new tangential velocity @xmath42 after the collision will then be @xmath43 let us now calculate the normal velocity component @xmath44 after the collision . first note that if @xmath45 ( here we have dropped the subscript from @xmath46 ) , then the particle can never overtake the vibrating ramp and hence the collision will surely happen when the sawtooth is moving upwards . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath47 then the particle can hit the ramp either in its upward or downward motion .",
    "furthermore , if the collision takes place during the downward motion , then depending on the particle velocity after the first collision there might ( or not ) be enough time for the sawtooth to revert its motion and hit the particle a second time . under the assumption that the vibration amplitude is negligibly small",
    ", one can calculate the probabilities for all possible cases . here",
    "we shall simply quote the final result and refer the interested reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for details of the calculation .",
    "if we define the parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , then the outgoing velocity @xmath44 and the corresponding probability @xmath51 are as follows :    1 .   @xmath52   \\quad { \\rm then}\\quad v'= -ev^ * + ( 1+e)\\tilde{v } , \\quad   p=1;$ ] 2 .",

    "@xmath57 @xmath58    this probabilistic collision rule together with ( [ eq : afteri ] ) thus yield the map @xmath59 for the case when the collision occurs with a ramp .",
    "next we consider the case when the particle hits a vertical wall ( i.e. , @xmath40 and @xmath60 ) .",
    "_ collision with a vertical wall .",
    "_ here we first need to determine the actual collision point @xmath61 with the vertical wall and the particle velocity @xmath62 just before such collision .",
    "it is easy to show @xcite that @xmath63 where @xmath64    according to our convention , the new departure point @xmath16 is given by @xmath65 now , to determine the velocity @xmath66 after the collision we simply apply the collision rule , @xmath67 and @xmath3 , since the vibration has no effect on the outgoing velocity in this case . to do that",
    ", we must first obtain @xmath68 in terms of @xmath62 , apply the above collision rule , and then return to the @xmath66 coordinates . performing this calculation ( details omitted ) , we find @xmath69 equations ( [ eq : xyvert])([eq : uvvert ] )",

    "the regions with @xmath71 and @xmath72 are separated by a critical line , and the dark regions correspond to points where current reversal ( @xmath73 ) occurs.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "although the map @xmath59 found above can not be studied analytically owing to the presence of a stochastic term , its long - term dynamics can be easily investigated on the computer . to this end , let us define the current @xmath74 in our model as the particle average horizontal velocity : @xmath75 , where the statistics is taken over a large number of collisions . in the present paper , we are mainly interested in mapping out the parameter space @xmath76 according to which dynamical regime ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 , or @xmath73 ) is observed at a given point . for illustration purposes ,",
    "it is best however to look at 2d slices of the parameter space and construct the corresponding phase diagram .",
    "two such phase diagrams are shown in figs .  2 for the planes @xmath77 and @xmath70 .",
    "with the help of fig .  2 , the generic behavior of our ratchet model can be summarized , as follows . for given values of @xmath78 and @xmath6 , we see that for sufficiently small @xmath79 there is no net current , i.e. , @xmath71 , meaning that the particle remains confined in one of the `` potential wells '' of the sawtooth profile .",
    "then as @xmath79 increases past a critical value @xmath80 , we observe a transition to a regime with @xmath72 , where the particle , on average , moves horizontally in the direction favoured by the ratchet asymmetry , namely , to the left . in the two - dimensional phase diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] , the critical surface @xmath80 appears as a critical line separating the region with @xmath71 from that with @xmath72 .",
    "furthermore , for certain values of @xmath79 , @xmath78 and @xmath6 , corresponding to the dark regions in fig .  2 , a horizontal flow in the ` unfavoured ' direction ( i.e. , with @xmath73 ) is established .",
    "notice that these current - reversal regions appear as band - like structures , a fact that can be traced back to the periodic nature of the ratchet profile @xcite .",
    "it is important to note , however , that current reversals can occur only for a sufficiently large @xmath78 and sufficiently small @xmath6 .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] , where there is no current reversal for @xmath81 in fig .",
    "2a nor for @xmath82 in fig .",
    "we have studied a simple model for a granular ratchet corresponding to a single grain bouncing off a vertically vibrating sawtooth - like base .",
    "we observe that for small shaking velocity @xmath79 , the particle remains confined between two teeth , with no net motion , whereas for larger @xmath79 a nonzero horizontal current is established . in this case , for most values of the parameters the particle moves in the preferred direction , but current reversals also occur rather regularly .",
    "this complex behavior is summarized in the phase diagram presented in fig .  2 , which shows the regions in the parameter space @xmath76 where each of the three possible regimes ( no current , normal current , and current reversal ) can occur .",
    "our single - particle model is thus able to reproduce some of the characteristic behavior observed in experiments @xcite and computer simulations @xcite of granular ratchets , such as horizontal transport and current reversals . in particular",
    ", our model shows that for current reversal to occur two key ingredients are necessary : i ) a sufficiently rough vibrating surface and ii ) sufficiently large dissipation at collisions .",
    "further investigation concerning the nature of the ` phase transition ' to the nonzero - current regime as well as a more detailed study of the current - reversal mechanism will be presented in a forthcoming publication ."
