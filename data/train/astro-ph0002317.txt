    "several methods ( e.g. , croft et al .",
    "1998 ; gnedin 1998 ; nusser & haehnelt 1999 ) have recently been proposed for extracting information on the mass density field from the lyman-@xmath11 forest .",
    "the underlying physical picture behind these method is that the absorbing neutral hydrogen in the low density intergalactic medium ( igm ) is tightly related to the mass density field on scales larger than the jeans length .",
    "below the jeans length gas pressure segregates the baryons from the total mass fluctuations . on scales near the jeans length",
    ", the evolution of the baryonic perturbation can affect estimates of the clustering amplitude from observations of the lyman-@xmath11 forest .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations ( petitjean , mcket & kates 1995 ; zhang , anninos & norman 1995 ; hernquist et al .  1996 ; miralda - escud et al .",
    "1996 , theuns et al . 1998 ) and semi - analytic models ( e.g. , bi et .",
    "1992 , gnedin & hui 1996 ) of the igm have been successful at explaining observations of the forest . despite the success of the simulations , it is usually difficult to use them to study in detail the evolution of the gas below jeans length ( theuns et al .",
    "the equations governing the evolution of baryons and dark matter in the nonlinear regime are extremely difficult to solve , even for special configurations like spherical collapse .",
    "fortunately , since most of the igm is of moderate density , linear analysis can be a suitable tool for understanding the evolution of the baryons ( gnedin & hui 1998 ) .",
    "here we derive analytic solutions to the linear equations in a flat universe without a cosmological constant .",
    "although the linear equations can readily be numerically integrated under a variety of conditions ( gnedin & hui 1998 ) , analytic treatment offers better understanding of the equations .",
    "further , the paucity of analytic solutions makes their pursue worthwhile , even if tedious at times .",
    "the analytic solutions we derive here are subject to the condition that the baryonic and dark matter trace the same density and velocity fields before a sudden reionization epoch .",
    "after reionization the temperature of the igm is assumed to be inversely proportional to the scale factor so that the comoving jeans length is constant .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we cast the equations in the form of linear differential equations with constant coefficients . in section 3",
    "we present the solutions to these equations for several cases .",
    "we conclude in section 4 .",
    "let @xmath12 and @xmath13 be , respectively , the fourier modes of baryonic and dark matter density fluctuations .",
    "let also @xmath14 and @xmath15 be the the mean mass fractions of these two types of matter .",
    "we will restrict the analysis to perturbations in a flat universe without a cosmological constant .",
    "the linear equations governing the evolution of @xmath16 and @xmath17 are ( e.g. , bi et .",
    "1992 , padmanabhan 1993 , gnedin & hui 1998 ) , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the scale factor , @xmath20 the hubble function , and @xmath1 is the comoving jeans wavenumber related to the speed of sound @xmath21 and the mean total ( baryons plus dark ) density , @xmath22 , by @xmath23    for @xmath24 close to unity the gravity of the baryons is negligible and @xmath25 . if also @xmath26 ( i.e. , @xmath27 ) and we impose , at some initial time @xmath28 , the condition @xmath29 , then @xmath30 at any later time , @xmath31 . in the next section",
    "we will show how to solve these equations with @xmath32 assuming that @xmath33 for @xmath34 , which is appropriate for a sudden reionization of the igm at @xmath28 .    in order to solve these equations we work with a new time variable @xmath35 instead of @xmath31 ( nusser & colberg 1998 ) . in terms of @xmath7",
    "the equations become , @xmath36 where have defined @xmath37 .",
    "when @xmath38 is constant , the differential equations ( [ lintau ] ) are linear with constant coefficients and they can be solved by means of laplace transformation . since laplace transforms are seldom used in cosmological studies , it seems prudent to briefly review their basic properties which are relevant to us .",
    "we refer the reader to arfkin ( 1985 ) and references therein for mathematical details .",
    "the laplace transform , @xmath39 , of a function @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , is defined as @xmath42 we will need the laplace transforms of first and second derivatives of a function . using ( [ laplace : def ] ) these transforms can be related to the @xmath39 by @xmath43 where the prime and double prime denote first and second order derivatives , respectively .",
    "the bromwich integral expresses @xmath40 in terms of @xmath39 as @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is a real number chosen so that all poles of @xmath39 lie , in the complex plane , to the left of the vertical line defining the integration path .",
    "therefore , by the residue theorem we have @xmath47 \\label{resid}\\ ] ] as an example consider @xmath48 which has two simple poles at @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the residues of @xmath51 at these poles are @xmath52 and @xmath53 so that , by ( [ resid ] ) , @xmath54/(s_1-s_2)$ ] . if @xmath55 , the function has a pole of order two at @xmath56 .",
    "the residue in this case is @xmath57/\\dd s$ ] evaluated at @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , @xmath59 .",
    "denote by @xmath60 and @xmath60 the laplace transforms of @xmath17 and @xmath16 , respectively . by taking the laplace transform of ( [ lintau ] )",
    "we can obtain relations between @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the initial conditions are contained in the laplace transforms of the first and second derivatives of the densities .",
    "so first we have to specify in mathematical terms our choice for the initial conditions . for simplicity of notation",
    "we fix the initial conditions at @xmath62 assuming that before that time the temperature of the baryonic fluid is zero , i.e. , @xmath63 .",
    "the initial conditions are fixed by the values of @xmath17 and @xmath16 and their first derivatives at @xmath62 . before @xmath62",
    ", we have @xmath64 , ignoring the decaying mode and setting arbitrarily @xmath65 .",
    "the first derivatives of @xmath17 and @xmath16 are therefore equal to unity at @xmath62 .",
    "this fixes the initial conditions necessary for solving ( [ lintau ] ) .",
    "although we will present solutions satisfying only these initial conditions , we will , for completeness , write the laplace transformation of ( [ lintau ] ) for @xmath66 and @xmath67 , at @xmath62",
    ". then the laplace transformation of ( [ lintau ] ) yields @xmath68 where have have used ( [ laplace : derv ] ) to computed the transforms of the first and second derivatives of @xmath17 and @xmath16 .",
    "for @xmath69 the first of these equations yields @xmath70 which is the laplace transform of @xmath71",
    ". if we take @xmath72 and substitute ( [ ldxfx ] ) in the second equation of ( [ laplace : lin ] ) we get @xmath73 which leads to the well known solution @xmath74",
    ".    subsequently we will present solutions only for @xmath75 . in this case , equations ( [ laplace : lin ] ) yield @xmath76 and @xmath77    before solving these equations for any value of @xmath78 in the range 01 , it is instructive to examine the solutions for the special values @xmath69 and @xmath79 .      in this case",
    "@xmath80 and equation ( [ dbdx ] ) can be written in the form @xmath81 where @xmath82 are the roots of @xmath83 .",
    "they are given by @xmath84 we will deal with the case @xmath85 at the end of this subsection . for @xmath86 ,",
    "all three poles of @xmath61 are simple and so , by ( [ resid ] ) , its inverse transform is @xmath87\\ ] ] for @xmath88 the roots @xmath82 are real and the result is @xmath89 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\rp}{4}\\right ) \\label{dbexp}\\ ] ] the first term is the solution given in the previous section for @xmath90 .",
    "the maximum value @xmath91 attains is unity , so the second and third terms are always decaying . if @xmath92 , then ( [ dbcon ] ) gives the solution @xmath93\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\rp}{4}\\right ) \\label{dbsin}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is the imaginary part of @xmath95 .",
    "the solution shows an oscillatory behavior with a period of @xmath96 .",
    "the envelope of these oscillations decays like @xmath97 .",
    "we deal now with the case @xmath98 , which occurs for @xmath99 . here",
    "special care is needed because @xmath100 .",
    "however the contribution of the pole at @xmath101 to the bromwich integral remains unchanged and the contribution of the second order pole at @xmath102 is simply the first derivative of @xmath103 at @xmath102 .",
    "the result is @xmath104 the first term on the left is the familiar @xmath105 evaluated at @xmath99 .",
    "the expression can also be derived by taking the limit @xmath106 in either ( [ dbexp ] ) or ( [ dbsin ] ) .    in the limit",
    "@xmath107 the ratio @xmath108 is @xmath109 .",
    "this is equivalent to ignoring the gravity of the dark matter .",
    "of course here only the behavior of the perturbation in the baryons is relevant since the dark matter plays no role . however , for the sake of completeness and comparison with other situations we will solve for the dark matter fluctuations as well .",
    "we first find the solution for @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath110 , we can express ( [ dxg ] ) in terms of @xmath82 , the roots of @xmath111 , as @xmath112 where @xmath113    if @xmath114 , then the function @xmath61 has three simple poles at @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 .",
    "so for @xmath118 and @xmath88 , bromwich integral yields @xmath119 + \\frac{1}{2\\chi}\\frac{1}{1-\\kappa^2 } \\biggl[\\left(\\chi-5\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\chi}{4}\\tau\\right ) + \\left(\\chi+5\\right)\\exp\\left(+\\frac{\\chi}{4}\\tau\\right)\\biggr ] \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\tau}{4}\\right ) \\ ; . \\label{dxs2}\\ ] ] the expression for @xmath16 is @xmath120 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\tau}{4}\\right ) \\ ; . \\label{dbs2}\\ ] ]    when @xmath121 the solution can be found either by taking the limit @xmath122 in the previous two expressions or by direct evaluation of the bromwich integral with a two poles of order two at @xmath115 and @xmath123 .",
    "the result is @xmath124 \\qquad { \\rm and } \\qquad \\db=3 - 2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\tau}{2}\\right )   \\ ; .\\ ] ] this implies that @xmath17 grows linearly with @xmath7 at late times while @xmath16 reaches an asymptotic value of @xmath125 .",
    "the oscillatory behavior of @xmath16 and @xmath17 appears when @xmath126 , i.e. , for @xmath127 .",
    "the expressions in this case can be obtained by replacing @xmath95 with @xmath128 in ( [ dxs2 ] ) and ( [ dbs2 ] ) . for @xmath129 ,",
    "the solution coincides with that given in padmanabhan ( 1993 )    in the limit @xmath107 the ratio @xmath108 is @xmath130 for @xmath131 and , zero otherwise .",
    "again we first derive @xmath17 .",
    "the denominator and numerator in ( [ dxg ] ) do not have any common roots .",
    "then the poles of @xmath60 are the roots of the denominator .",
    "we find these roots as follows .",
    "denote @xmath133 and equate denominator to zero to obtain @xmath134 where we have used @xmath135 .",
    "this equation is satisfied for the following values of @xmath136 , @xmath137 where the subscripts @xmath138 and @xmath139 correspond to the plus and minus sign , respectively .",
    "so the roots of the denominator in ( [ dxg ] ) are the values of @xmath140 which make @xmath141 .",
    "let @xmath142 and @xmath143 be the roots of @xmath144 and @xmath145 , respectively .",
    "they are given by @xmath146    excluding the values @xmath147 and @xmath148 , which we have considered in the previous subsections , we have @xmath149 .",
    "this ensures that all four roots , @xmath143 and @xmath150 , are distinct .",
    "also , @xmath151 for any @xmath38 , so the roots @xmath152 are real .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath153 when @xmath154 , and negative otherwise .",
    "so @xmath143 can be complex .    for @xmath155 , the bromwich integral yields @xmath156 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\tau}{4}\\right )   + ( \\chi_p \\longleftrightarrow \\chi_m ) \\ ; , \\ ] ] with the second term on the r.h.s",
    "is obtained interchanging @xmath157 and @xmath158 in the first term .",
    "this result can be extended to @xmath159 by writing @xmath160 where @xmath161 is real .    using ( [ dbdx ] )",
    "we similarly obtain",
    "@xmath16 @xmath162 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\tau}{4}\\right )   +   ( \\chi_p \\longleftrightarrow \\chi_m ) \\ ; .\\ ] ]    to visualize these solutions , we show in fig.1 the density evolution for various values of @xmath24 and @xmath38 .",
    "the dark matter curve for @xmath163 is very close to @xmath71 . for @xmath164",
    "the baryonic perturbations for both values of @xmath24 show oscillations with similar period and amplitude .",
    "this is simply because for high @xmath38 , the evolution is mainly dictated by pressure forces .",
    "in fig.2 we the solid lines represent the ratio @xmath165 as a function of @xmath38 at different @xmath7 designated in the plot by the redshift , @xmath166 .",
    "the initial conditions are satisfied at @xmath167 and @xmath163 was taken .",
    "also plotted , as the dotted line in each panel , the function @xmath109 which represents the limiting solution as @xmath107 .",
    "the analytic curves show more oscillations as they get closer to the limiting solution , when the redshift is decreased .    in many applications ( e.g. , bi et al 1992 , bi & davidsen 1997 , nusser & haehnelt 2000 ) the limiting ratio @xmath109 is often used to filter the mass power spectrum in order to generate density fluctuations in the gas .",
    "as pointed out by gnedin & hui ( 1998 ) this may lead to a significant bias in statistics of the gas density . as an illustration of this bias we compute the rms values of the gas density by filtering a scale free mass power spectrum of slope @xmath168 with the ratio @xmath169 given from the analytic , and the limiting solutions , respectively .",
    "fig.3 shows the ratio of the former to the latter rms value . as in the previous figure",
    ", @xmath163 and initial conditions satisfied at @xmath167 . using the filter @xmath109",
    "can seriously underestimate the amplitude of gas density fluctuations .",
    "only when we approach @xmath170 the ratio gets close to to unity .",
    "we have found analytic solutions to the linear equations governing the evolution of baryonic and dark matter under four assumptions .",
    "first , the universe is flat without cosmological constant .",
    "second , sudden reionization of the igm .",
    "third , the temperature of the low density igm drops like @xmath171 so that the comoving jeans length is time independent .",
    "fourth , before reionization the igm is cold and the baryonic and dark matter trace the same density and velocity fields .    of these assumptions , only the fourth has a physical basis , at least before any heating has occurred and when the igm temperature is low .",
    "this is also the only assumption which if changed , the equations can still be readily solved by laplace transformation . unfortunately , relaxing any of the other assumptions complicates the analytic treatment of equations ( [ lintau ] ) by means of laplace transformation . for example , suppose that the jeans wavenumber changes with time according to @xmath172 .",
    "then the laplace transformation of the term involving @xmath1 will yield @xmath61 at @xmath173 while other terms involve @xmath174 .    yet",
    "the solutions can be useful for semi - analytic modeling of the igm .",
    "they offer a convenient improvement over the commonly used filter @xmath4 $ ] for generating gas fluctuations associated with a given mass density field .",
    "the analytic solutions presented here were verified by a comparison with the solutions obtained by numerical integration of equations ( [ lint ] ) . all numerical and analytic solutions agreed up to the numerical accuracy .",
