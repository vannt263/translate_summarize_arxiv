    "a stochastic background of gravitational waves ( sbgw ) is expected to result from the incoherent superposition of gravitational radiation from a large number of sources @xcite .",
    "it can be subdivided into a cosmological background of primordial gravitational waves ( gws ) generated by processes of the very early universe , and into an astrophysical background produced by a large number of unresolved astrophysical sources that consist of an accelerated mass distribution with a quadrupole moment .",
    "many potential processes of the very early universe have been proposed as generators of cosmological sbgws , examples of which are standard inflationary models , pre - big - bang models , and cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "candidate sources to produce the astrophysical component are , for instance , compact binary star systems , core collapse supernovae , and rotating neutron stars @xcite . since the universe has been essentially transparent to gravitational radiation from the very beginning , gws are ideal carriers of information on the physical processes that generated them and thus on the state of the universe at the time they were produced .",
    "this background encodes information on the very early epoch as well as on the more recent history of the universe that is not accessible to conventional astronomical observations based on electromagnetic waves @xcite .",
    "extracting this astrophysical and cosmological information from the sbgw and thus disentangling the various contributions requires gw experiments in a variety of frequency bands .",
    "tight upper bounds on the sbgw have been placed at high and low frequencies by earth - based interferometric detectors such as ligo ( around @xmath2 ; @xcite ) , pulsar timing observations based on the residuals of pulse arrival times ( between @xmath3 ; @xcite ) , and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations at large angular scales which indicate an upper limit on the cosmological component of the sbgw at larger wavelengths than the horizon size at the time the cmb was produced ( @xmath4 ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the intermediate frequency regime between @xmath5 has proven to be particularly challenging to be probed by gw experiments and has thus remained essentially unexplored until today . apart from the frequency - independent indirect limits from cmb and big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) data @xcite , which only place tight bounds on the cosmological component of the sbgw , there are limits from doppler tracking of the cassini spacecraft ( @xmath6 ; @xcite ) , from precision orbital monitoring of the hulse - taylor binary pulsar ( at @xmath7 ; @xcite ) , from seismic data of the earth ( @xmath8 ; @xcite ) , and from a pair of torsion - bar antennas ( tobas ; @xmath9 ; @xcite ) . in the @xmath10 regime ,",
    "in particular , the astrophysical component of the sbgw could well outshine the cosmological component , revealing rich astrophysical information on , for example , the physics of compact objects and star formation history @xcite . proposed space missions to explore the latter frequency range are the new gravitational wave observatory ngo ( a.k.a .",
    "elisa ; @xcite ) and the deci - hertz interferometer gravitational wave observatory decigo @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical work on the excitation of global stellar oscillations by gws @xcite together with helio- and asteroseismic data allows us to employ the sun and other solar - like stars as astronomical test masses for the detection of gws .",
    "helioseismic sun - as - a - star data for internal gravity and pressure modes of the sun is available from , e.g. , the global oscillation at low frequency ( golf ) instrument aboard the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( _ soho _ ) spacecraft @xcite , while asteroseismic data from missions like _ corot _ @xcite and _ kepler _ @xcite offer the possibility to employ other solar - like stars .    here ,",
    "we propose a method to directly detect or constrain both the astrophysical and cosmological component of the sbgw at @xmath1 and @xmath0 frequencies by using asteroseismic observations ( section  [ sec : method ] ) .",
    "while this method is general and can be applied to any star , we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by deducing a direct upper bound around @xmath11 using our sun as a hydrodynamic detector ( section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec : discussion ] is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "our method is based on the theoretical result that stellar oscillations can be excited by an sbgw @xcite . in the case of the sun",
    ", the resulting amplitudes can be close to or comparable with values expected from excitation by near - surface convection @xcite , which is considered to be the main driving mechanism for oscillations in the sun and solar - like stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the physical mechanism underlying the excitation by an sbgw is the fact that gws manifest themselves in oscillating tidal forces : they periodically stretch and compress the spatial dimensions orthogonal to the direction of propagation in a quadrupolar pattern , thus imposing stresses on the matter they pass through .",
    "global stellar oscillations can be classified into acoustic pressure modes ( _ p _ modes ) , with pressure gradients as the restoring force , and interior gravity modes ( _ g _ modes ) , with buoyancy as the restoring force @xcite . both _",
    "p _ and _ g _ modes can be excited by gws , although only quadrupolar eigenmodes can attain non - vanishing amplitudes due to the quadrupole nature of the excitation force .",
    "this fact can help to distinguish an sbgw from other excitation mechanisms ( the `` noise '' ) .",
    "the equation of motion for stellar oscillations in presence of external driving by gws is the inhomogeneous wave equation for the velocity field @xmath12 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the density and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are linear differential operators ( see @xcite for definitions ) .",

    ", @xmath21 denotes the gw tensor .",
    "the velocity field in equation   can be expanded in terms of the complete set of eigenfunctions @xmath22 of the operator @xmath15 , which define the solutions @xmath23 of the homogeneous problem @xmath24 @xmath25 hence , the intrinsic complex velocity field associated with a stellar oscillation normal mode as a function of time @xmath26 and position @xmath27 within the star can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a time - dependent complex amplitude , @xmath30 denotes the displacement eigenfunction , @xmath31 the oscillation frequency , and @xmath32 is an abridged index denoting the eigenmode under consideration with radial order @xmath33 , harmonic degree @xmath34 and azimuthal order @xmath35 . in the pulsation frame of a slowly rotating star ( polar axis",

    "the quantity that is directly accessible to asteroseismic and sun - as - a - star radial velocity measurements is the disk - integrated , apparent surface velocity of a mode ( the observed root mean square ( rms ) surface velocity ) , which can be expressed as ( cf . also @xcite ) @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes temporal average and where we defined the complex apparent surface velocity @xmath46 as observed in the observer s frame with spherical coordinates @xmath47 ( the direction @xmath48 points toward the observer and @xmath49 corresponds to the center of the star ) . in equation  , @xmath50 denotes the visible half sphere corresponding to the parameter space @xmath51 , @xmath52 the limb angle , @xmath53 the surface element projected onto the direction of the observer , and @xmath54 the distance between the center of the star and the layer where the apparent surface velocity is observed .",

    "given an upper bound on the apparent surface velocity @xmath57 of a quadrupolar stellar eigenmode with frequency @xmath79 and assuming that the observed oscillations of a star are excited at least partially by a stochastic background of gravitational radiation as one of the driving forces , equations   and imply an upper limit on the normalized spectral energy density of the sbgw according to @xmath80 here , @xmath81 is the coupling factor between the gw field and the stellar oscillation mode , i.e. , the susceptibility of a particular mode to the gw background .",
    "the factor @xmath82 is the observed mode mass ( the observed value for the total interior mass of the star that is affected by the oscillation ) , which takes instrumental and other observation - related effects into account ( cf . equation  ) .",
    "we note that the left - hand side of equation   is independent of the hubble constant and thus independent of its uncertainty .",
    "the method described in the previous section is very general and applies to any solar - like oscillator . here , we compute an upper limit employing our nearest star , the sun , as a hydrodynamic detector . the underlying solar model that we use",
    "is model s @xcite , which is extensively used as a reference solar model ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a discussion on the current status of the standard solar model ) .",
    "thanks to the very high level of agreement in the numerical results for solar(-like ) models computed with present stellar evolution codes @xcite , any other well - fitted solar model could have been used , such as , e.g. , the cesam model employed by @xcite .",
    "we note that the mean quadratic differences in the physical and seismic variables between solar models computed with , e.g. , astec and cesam are particularly small ( mean quadratic differences in the physical and thermodynamic variables are often well below or on the order of @xmath83 ; differences in the oscillation frequencies are typically less than @xmath84 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the solar oscillation modes best - suited for deducing an upper bound on a gw background are the high - frequency ( low radial order ) quadrupolar _ g _ modes , as they are most sensitive to such a background @xcite : the corresponding intrinsic mean - square amplitudes @xmath85 are typically orders of magnitude larger than for low radial order quadrupolar _ p",

    "their surface velocities are extremely small , because these modes are evanescent in the convection zone .",
    "theoretical quantitative estimates for solar _ g_-mode surface velocities are highly uncertain and differ from each other by orders of magnitude ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is predominantly due to the hypotheses made in the excitation models concerning turbulent convection and , in particular , the choice of the eddy - time correlation function @xcite .",

    "this limit is based on level 2 golf data , which were calibrated using the method described by @xcite .",

    ", the astrophysical background due to supermassive black hole binaries becomes important ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the method presented in this paper makes the aforementioned frequency range accessible by providing a possibility to place direct bounds on an sbgw at @xmath128hz and mhz frequencies with asteroseismic data . despite some partial overlap with the cassini band , this method can somewhat bridge the gap between the cassini range and the bounds from earth - based interferometers , possibly improving on the cassini limits ( see below ) .",
    "it is important to point out that there are indirect upper limits in this frequency range , which are deduced from cmb and bbn data due to the fact that a larger amplitude of the sbgw would have altered the observed abundances of the light nuclei created during bbn ; analogously , a larger amplitude would have also modified the cmb and matter power spectra . however , these are indirect bounds in the sense that they constrain the integrated total energy density @xmath129 over the frequency ranges indicated in figure  [ fig : upper_bounds ] as @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they solely constrain primordial gws , which already existed at the time when , respectively , the cmb was formed and the nucleosynthesis took place .",
    "in particular , these bounds can not constrain the astrophysically generated gws , which were produced at later times and which are still generated today .",
    "in contrast to these indirect limits , our method reported here yields direct upper bounds that additionally constrain the astrophysical component of the stochastic gw background .",
    "they complement the direct upper limits in other frequency bands and the integrated , indirect upper limits in the same frequency regime . furthermore ,",
    "unlike most of the other direct bounds , our method does not assume a certain spectral shape for the function @xmath86 , i.e. , it applies to an arbitrary function @xmath86 , regardless of the global shape of @xmath86 .",
    "the upper bound given by equation   is highly sensitive to local ( i.e. , seismic ; cf . the wide range in sensitivity in figures  [ fig : upper_bound ] and [ fig : upper_bounds ] ) and global stellar properties and to the observed surface velocities of the modes .",
    "space missions like _ corot _ and _ kepler _ recorded asteroseismic intensity data for a wide range of stellar mass , radius and effective temperature . furthermore , radial velocity measurements of stellar oscillations from ground exist .",
    "the precision of helioseismic measurements might not be achieved by asteroseismology . in particular , from solar observations it can be concluded that the signal - to - noise ratio of intensity variations are expected to be an order of magnitude lower than for velocity measurements @xcite , and radial velocity measurements might not yet achieve a precision on the order of mm / s .",
    "however , these limitations could be overcompensated by several orders of magnitude due to the dependence of equation   on , e.g. , stellar mass and radius  @xcite , and stellar modelling can guide observations to find optimal targets .",
    "still , a conversion from intensity to velocity amplitudes is required before using intensity data in equation  , but this might be , e.g. , obtained empirically from comparisons of intensity and velocity measurements , as , for instance , carried out by _ soho _ for the sun @xcite or between _ kepler _ intensity and follow - up radial velocity data for the stars .",
    "therefore , the existing and up - coming space - based missions , as well as ground - based facilities like song @xcite , offer a unique possibility to focus on targets with optimized sets of stellar parameters in terms of detector sensitivity and to possibly employ these stars as a large array of low - frequency antennas for the sbgw at @xmath0 and @xmath1 frequencies by using the method presented here .                        ,",
