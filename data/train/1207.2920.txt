    "the presence of a scalar field is motivated by ideas in high energy physics and quantum gravities , although it has not been discovered experimentally .",

    "it is nevertheless widely accepted in several theoretical modeling frameworks , especially in contemporary cosmology of which an early - time accelerating expansion , the inflation is proposed to be driven by a scalar field in order to solve horizon and flatness problems @xcite .",
    "after inflation , components of barotropic fluids such as radiation and other non - relativistic matter were produced during reheating and cooling - down processes .",
    "the present universe is also found to be in acceleration phase which is strongly backed up by various observations , e.g. the cosmic microwave background @xcite , large - scale structure surveys @xcite and supernovae ( sn ) type ia observations @xcite .",
    "the scalar field could be responsible to the present acceleration in various models of dark energy @xcite .",
    "power - law cosmology with @xmath3 , describes an acceleration phase for with @xmath4 .",
    "the model provides simple model of expansion as well as a convenient way to fit with observations .",
    "although tightly constrained by nucleosynthesis @xcite , the power - law expansion with @xmath5 , could be considered viable at later time sufficiently long after matter - radiation equality era .",
    "studies of high - redshift objects such as globular clusters @xcite , sn ia data @xcite , sn ia with @xmath1 data @xcite and of x - ray gas mass fraction measurement of galaxy clusters @xcite within context of power - law cosmology have been reported from time to time .",
    "moreover other aspects such as gravitational lensing statistics @xcite and angular size - redshift data of compact radio sources @xcite of the power - law cosmology can be applied to constrain the model .",
    "motivations of the model are various .",
    "simplest inflationary model with power - law expansion can remove flatness and horizon problems leaving with simple spectrum @xcite .",
    "in present universe , idea of linear coasting cosmology ( @xmath6 ) @xcite are proposed such that it can resolve age problem in the cdm model @xcite . on fundamental physics motivation ,",
    "the linear coasting model can arise from non - minimally coupled scalar - tensor theory in which the scalar field couples to the curvature contributing to energy density that cancels out vacuum energy @xcite .",
    "the model could also be a result of domination of an su(2 ) cosmological instanton in the early universe @xcite .",
    "we consider a non - flat ( @xmath7 ) flrw universe with expansion in the form of the power law function .",
    "the power - law expansion occurs well after matter - radiation equality era .",

    "previously , not within the context of power - law cosmology , there are a number of works in constructing scalar field potential directly from observational data or in theoretical construction of potential under specific assumption .",
    "these are considered in various situations , for example , construction of the potential using sne ia dataset @xcite , construction of potential assuming scaling solution @xcite , case of scalar field negative potential without using observational data @xcite , construction of scalar field potential using dark energy density function with non - specified expansion law @xcite and other several works in @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we also consider situation when there is interaction between cold dark matter and dark energy with constant interaction rate @xcite .",
    "we see how the interaction can affect scalar field potential and we will find mass potential function of the interaction lagrangian .",
    "we stress that the wmap5 combined dataset allows non - flat universe and dark energy equation of state .",
    "this is because the addition of the sn ia analysis to the wmap5 dataset marginalize the equation of state parameter and spatial curvature at the same time .",
    "the later wmap7 dataset is not suitable our study since its relevant derived parameters are found under flat assumption , allowing only studying of equation of state .",

    "<S> time scale characterizing domination of the kinematic expansion terms over the dust and curvature terms in the scalar field potential are found to be approximately 5.3 to 5.5 gyr . </S>",
