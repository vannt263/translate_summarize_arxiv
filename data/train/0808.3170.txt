    "it is widely believed that the basic features of collective motion in relativistic heavy - ion collisions can be well described by using the ( almost ) ideal hydrodynamic model @xcite .",
    "several studies on the effects of viscosity are available in various works and seem to support such a vision 1st - a,1st - b , muro,2nd , heinzson , heinzson2,dkkm1,dkkm2,dkkm3 . however , the inclusion of the dissipation into the relativistic hydrodynamics is not trivial because the naive generalization of the navier - stokes equation gives rise to the problems of acausality and instability .",
    "various theories have been proposed to incorporate dissipation consistent with causality and stability : the divergence type theory @xcite , the israel - stewart theory @xcite , the extended irreversible thermodynamics @xcite , carter s theory @xcite , ttinger - grmela formulation @xcite , the approach base on conformal field theory @xcite and so on . however , the relations between these theories are not well clarified and the formulation of the relativistic hydrodynamics itself has not yet established .",
    "one crucial point of these theories is that dissipative fluids behave as a kind of non - newtonian fluids in a relativistic energy regime @xcite .",
    "recently , we proposed another formulation of the relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics , stressing this aspect @xcite .",
    "the definition of the irreversible current is modified by the introduction of a memory function , and we showed that such an effect is enough to solve the problem of acausality .",
    "we also found that the theory is stable against the linear perturbations around the hydrostatic state @xcite .",
    "this vision offers new possibilities in adapting the techniques developed for _ newtonian fluids _ to a _ non - newtonian _ regime @xcite .",
    "although our equations of the dissipative hydrodynamics can be reduced to the truncated israel - stewart ( is ) theory , this formulation can be generalized for the application to ultra - relativistic situations .",
    "one of the important assumptions in the derivation of hydrodynamics is the local equilibrium ansatz : at any space point , there should exist an _",
    "finite _ extension of the fluid which is described by the thermodynamic laws in equilibrium .",
    "we refer such an element of the fluid to a fluid cell .",
    "the irreversible currents are phenomenologically defined so that the second law of thermodynamics is satisfied for each fluid cell .",
    "these fluid cells permit superpositions and need not to be exclusive , each other , but they have to be of finite size to apply thermodynamics .",
    "however , in the usual hydrodynamic formulation , the finiteness of the fluid cell is considered to be irrelevant and the irreversible currents are defined by applying the second law for _ densities _ of extensive quantities .",
    "this does not give rise to problems in the ( relativistic ) navier - stokes theory , because thermodynamic forces instantaneously produce irreversible currents .",
    "that is , the time scale of deformation of a fluid cell is considered infinitely large in comparison with this scale .",
    "this is also the case when the relaxation time , which characterizes the memory effect , is small compared to the variation scale of the fluid .",
    "however , when the relaxation time is of the same order as the variation scale , we have to distinguish the quantities affected by the change in internal degrees of freedom from the global kinematic degrees of freedom in introducing memory effects .    in this paper , we rederive the causal dissipative hydrodynamics by taking the finite size of the fluid cell into account . for simplicity , we consider the 1 + 1 dimensional system .",
    "we found that the equation of the bulk viscosity has a nonlinear term .",
    "because of the nonlinear term , the effect of bulk viscosity is suppressed and the behavior of the fluid is closer to that of the ideal fluid .",
    "more importantly , we found that this effect is indispensable to implement stable numerical calculations in ultra - relativistic initial conditions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[chap:2 ]",
    ", we discuss the new formulation of relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics by taking the finite size of the fluid cell into account . the restriction for the parameters which are consistent with causality",
    "is discussed in sec.[chap:3 ] . in sec.[chap:4 ] , we apply our theory to the 1 + 1 dimensional scaling solution of the bjorken model . in sec.[chap:5 ] , we implements numerical simulations .",
    "we apply the smoothed particle formulation to solve the hydrodynamics numerically . here",
    ", we discussed three examples , the shock formation , the expansion to vacuum with landau initial condition and the appearance of nonperiodic oscillations similar to turbulence .",
    "we show that the result of our formulation can be justified from the viewpoint of the extended irreversible thermodynamics in sec.[chap:6 ] .",
    "the relation between our theory and the israel - stewart theory is discussed in sec.[chap:7 ] .",
    "sec.[chap:8 ] is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "for simplicity , we consider the case of vanishing baryon chemical potential for the simple 1 + 1 dimensional system . in this case , the hydrodynamic equations of motion can be written as only the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath0together with the thermodynamic relations .",
    "we adopt the local equilibrium ansatz in the energy local rest frame , as proposed by landau - lifshitz ll .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is given by @xmath1where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are , respectively , the energy density , pressure , four - velocity and bulk viscosity . from eq.(tmunu ) , we obtain the entropy production rate in terms of densities , @xmath6    we should remember that the local thermal equilibrium ansatz must be applied to a fluid cell which , in principle , has a finite volume defined by the coarse - grained size of microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "the thermodynamic laws should be applied to the integrated quantities of the fluid inside each cell . to see this more clearly ,",
    "let us introduce the volume @xmath7 of such a fluid cell .",
    "that is , @xmath7 is the volume of the fluid at the point @xmath8 , inside of which the fluid is considered to be homogeneous and satisfies the thermodynamic laws in equilibrium .",
    "the flow of the fluid deforms such a cell so that its volume is a function of time .",
    "if we follow the fluid flow given by the velocity field @xmath9 , the time variation of @xmath10 is given by @xmath11or in a covariant form , @xmath12where we have introduced the proper reference density @xmath13 by @xmath14where @xmath15 is the lorentz factor .",
    "now , let us denote the extensive measure of the entropy inside this volume as @xmath16 .",
    "then we rewrite eq.([dsmu / dt ] ) as@xmath17with @xmath18is the extensive measure inside the fluid cell of the irreversible current @xmath19 .",
    "one can see that eq.([eqn : epuc ] ) has the structure that the net entropy production in the cell is given by the product of the irreversible displacement @xmath20 occurred in the cell and the corresponding thermodynamic force field @xmath21 in the cell .",
    "it should be noted that , from eq .",
    "( [ continuity ] ) , the thermodynamic force is reexpressed as @xmath22 this result means that the thermodynamic force for the fluid cell is given by the change of the cell volume , indicating clearly the physical meaning of the bulk viscosity : the resistance to the change of the volume of the system .    in the relativistic navier - stokes theory ( the landau - lifshitz theory )",
    ", it is assumed that the bulk viscosity per volume element is produced by the thermodynamic force without any retardation , @xmath23where @xmath24 represents a extensive measure of coupling ( total charge ) for the whole matter inside the cell .",
    "we thus identify @xmath25 as the bulk viscosity coefficient . by multiplying @xmath13 for both sides , we reproduce the usual result of the landau - lifshitz theory @xcite .",
    "that is , the finite size effect does not affect the definition of irreversible currents in the navier - stokes theory .",
    "however , it is by now well known that the derived equation has the problem of acausality and instability dkkm1,dkkm2,dkkm3 . to solve these difficulties ,",
    "we introduce a memory effect to the irreversible current by using a memory function .",
    "when microscopic and macroscopic scales are clearly separated , the time scale of the variation of the fluid cell itself is infinitely large compared to the microscopic scales , and only the change in the internal degrees of freedom is relevant . if , however , this is not true , they are entangled and we have to distinguish their roles .",
    "one is the change of the internal degrees of freedom with the transient effects ( memory effect ) and the other the motion of the global kinematic degrees of freedom ( fluid cell deformation ) . as the simplest memory function which can be reduced to the differential equation",
    ", we apply @xmath26here , @xmath27 is a relaxation time which characterizes the time scale of the retardation . in the previous work @xcite",
    ", we have applied this memory function to the thermodynamic force @xmath28 ( not @xmath29 ) to introduce the retardation . as a consequence , the final form of the derived equation for @xmath30",
    "is same as that of the so - called truncated form of the is equation , where nonlinear terms are ignored .",
    "however as we mentioned before , when we deal with memory effects , we should not use densities .",
    "this is because memory effects relate different thermodynamic states of the matter for different times and this depends on the size of the system not necessarily in an extensive manner .",
    "then the memory effect should be applied to the integrated quantity of a fluid cell .    in this paper , we introduce the memory effect of the thermodynamic force field on an extensive measure for the irreversible current . then the bulk viscosity consistent with causality is given by @xmath31where @xmath32 is the initial value given at @xmath33 .",
    "this integral form is equivalent to the solution of the following differential equation , @xmath34this equation can be reexpressed in terms of the density as follows , @xmath35on the other hand , the corresponding equation in our previous paper dkkm1 where the memory effect is directly applied to the densities has the form , @xmath36the difference of eq.([eqn : neweqbulk2 ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ trunc ] ) is the presence of the term @xmath37 .",
    "it should be noted that eq .",
    "( [ eqn : neweqbulk2 ] ) also does not explicitly depend on the cell volume @xmath38 .",
    "this is because the size of the cell volume is irrelevant as far as the length is much larger than the mean - free path and much smaller than the typical hydrodynamic scale . for later convenience",
    ", we call the causal dissipative hydrodynamics without the finite size effect , eq.([trunc ] ) as linear causal dissipative hydrodynamics ( lcdh ) , whereas the one with finite size effect , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : neweqbulk2 ] ) as nonlinear causal dissipative hydrodynamics ( nlcdh )",
    ".    an important effect due to the nonlinear term is the lower bound of the bulk viscosity . in lcdh",
    ", the bulk viscosity can , in principle , take any negative value . in nlcdh , when the bulk viscosity becomes negatively large , the effective bulk viscosity coefficient @xmath39 eventually changes sign and the bulk viscosity start to increase . thus , the bulk viscosity in nlcdh can not be smaller than@xmath40 when the initial value of @xmath30 is larger than @xmath41 .",
    "this aspect plays an important role for the stability of numerical simulations of ultra - relativistic cases , as we will see sec .",
    "[ chap:5 ] .",
    "we parametrize the bulk viscosity coefficient and the relaxation time as follows , @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are arbitrary constants .    as was pointed out in @xcite",
    ", lcdh can be acausal depending on the choice of the parameters . to see the limitation of the parameters",
    ", we have to calculate the propagation speed of nlcdh .",
    "following @xcite , we discuss the linear perturbation around the hydrostatic state",
    ". then the nonlinear term of the equation of the bulk viscosity ( [ eqn : neweqbulk2 ] ) disappears and the dispersion relation is same as that of lcdh @xcite .",
    "thus , by assuming the group velocity gives the propagating speed of the dissipative fluid , we found @xmath45 where @xmath46 . to satisfy causality @xmath47 ,",
    "the parameter @xmath44 should be less than @xmath48 .",
    "this is completely the same restriction as the case of lcdh @xcite .",
    "we apply nlcdh to the one dimensional scaling solution of the bjorken model . then the hydrodynamic equations are given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we adopt the massless ideal gas equation of state where @xmath52 . to satisfy causality",
    ", the parameter @xmath44 should be larger than @xmath53 . in this calculation",
    ", we choose @xmath54 . for the initial condition , we set @xmath55 and @xmath56 at the initial proper time @xmath57 fm .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] , we show the energy density @xmath58 as a function of the proper time @xmath59 .",
    "the dotted , dashed and solid lines correspond to the ideal hydrodynamics , lcdh and nlcdh , respectively . because of the memory effect",
    ", the behaviors of lcdh and nlcdh are similar to that of the ideal fluid at the early stage of the time evolution . after the time larger than the relaxation time",
    ", the behaviors of lcdh deviates from that of the ideal hydrodynamics . on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior of nlcdh stays close to that of the ideal hydrodynamics , that is , the effect of the bulk viscosity is suppressed in nlcdh compared to lcdh .",
    "this is directly observed from the behavior of the bulk viscosity as is shown in fig .",
    "fig : scaling2 .",
    "it should be noted that the scaling solution of the bulk viscosity including the similar nonlinear term was already discussed in @xcite , where the equation derived by israel and stewart is discussed .",
    "the relation of our equation and the israel - stewart equation will be discussed in sec .",
    "to solve numerically the hydrodynamic equations , we use the smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) method .",
    "the original idea of the sph method is to obtain an approximate solution of hydrodynamics by parameterizing the fluid into a set of effective particles @xcite .",
    "because of its flexibility to adapt to complex geometries , the sph method has also been extensively applied to the relativistic heavy ion reactions to perfom an event - by - event analysis of the data @xcite . for the sake of convenience , we reproduce below the ideas and basic equations of the sph approach shown in @xcite .",
    "let us consider a distribution @xmath60 of any extensive physical quantity , @xmath61 . in a system like the hot and dense matter created in heavy ion collisions ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath62 contains the effects of whole microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "we are not interested in the extremely short wavelength behavior of @xmath63 but rather in global behaviors which are related directly to the experimental observables .",
    "therefore , we would like to introduce a coarse - graining procedure for @xmath43 . to do this , we introduce the kernel function @xmath64 which maps the original distribution @xmath43 to a coarse - grained version @xmath65 as , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is normalized , @xmath68 and has a bounded support of the scale of @xmath69 , @xmath70 satisfying @xmath71 here , @xmath69 is a typical length scale for the coarse - graining in the sense that the kernel function @xmath67 introduces a cut - off in short wavelength of the order of @xmath69 .",
    "thus we will take this value as the scale of coarse graining in the qcd dynamics ( i.e. , the mean - free path of partons ) to obtain the hydrodynamics of qgp ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the second step is to approximate this coarse - grained distribution @xmath73 by replacing the integral in eq.([as ] ) by a summation over a finite and discrete set of points , @xmath74 , @xmath75 if the choice of @xmath76 and @xmath77 are appropriate , the above expression should converge to the coarse - grained distribution @xmath65 for large @xmath78 .",
    "parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 should be determined from the dynamics of the system . in practice , we first choose the reference density @xmath81 which is conserved,@xmath82 where @xmath83 is the current associated with the density @xmath84 then , we note that the following ansatzes , @xmath85 satisfies the equation , @xmath86 where @xmath87 s are constant . by using the normalization of @xmath67",
    ", we have @xmath88 then we can interpret the quantity @xmath87 as the conserved quantity attached at the point @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , the distribution @xmath90 is a sum of small piece - wise distribution , carrying the density,@xmath91 these pieces are referred to as `` sph - particles '' .    using the above reference density and the extensive nature of @xmath92 we can write @xmath93 in eq.([asph ] ) as@xmath94 which represents the quantity @xmath61 carried by the sph particle at the position @xmath89 .",
    "in fact , the total amount of @xmath95 of the system at the instant @xmath96 is given by@xmath97    in the ideal fluid , the entropy density is chosen as the reference density and the dynamics of the parameters @xmath98 are determined from the variational principle from the action of ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "the entropy density is , however , not conserved for the dissipative fluid .",
    "thus we introduce a new conserved quantity , the specific proper density @xmath13 , which is defined by the flow of the fluid , @xmath99 and we will use it as the reference density for viscous fluids . here , the four - velocity @xmath100 is defined in terms of the local rest frame of the energy flow ( landau frame ) .",
    "the specific density is expressed in the sph form as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the specific density in the laboratory frame and @xmath87 is the inverse of the specific volume of the sph particle @xmath103 . in this work",
    ", the specific volume should be interpreted as the volume of the fluid cell , and hence @xmath87 is the inverse of the cell volume . however , as we showed , the finial results do not depend on this choice and we set @xmath104 for simplicity . as for the kernel @xmath105",
    ", we use the spline function .",
    "it should be mentioned that this procedure is only possible provided that the lines of flow in space defined by the velocity field @xmath100 do not cross each other during the evolution in time .",
    "that is , if there appear turbulence or singularities in the flow lines , the above definition of lagrange coordinates can fail .",
    "now we apply this method to nlcdh in @xmath106 dimension .",

    "one can easily see that the equation of , for example , the bulk viscosity is nothing but the equation obtained in our formulation , by setting @xmath179 and @xmath180 .    to our best knowledge , this is the derivation of the relativistic hydrodynamics based on the extended irreversible thermodynamics for the first time . as just described , our formulation and the extended irreversible thermodynamic derives the same equation .",
    "the only difference is that the thermodynamic variables @xmath58 and @xmath3 in nlcdh satisfy usual thermodynamic relation , while the variables obey the extended thermodynamic relation in the hydrodynamic equation of the extended irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "note that it is sometimes said that the concept of thermodynamics is extended in the is theory .",
    "however , as is discussed in appendix [ app : is ] in detail , the first law of thermodynamics is modified in a different way in the is theory , without increasing the number of thermodynamical variables .",
    "as was shown in the previous section , the equation obtained in our formulation can be derived also from the extended irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "exactly speaking , the similar non - linear term appears even in the is theory , although in the so - called truncated version of is theory the non - linear terms are ignored .",
    "then the equation of the bulk viscosity in the original is theory is given by @xmath181the last two terms on the r. h. s. are ignored in the truncated is theory . for detailed derivation ,",
    "see appendix [ app : is ] . here",
    "we used the relation @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "one can easily see that there are two differences between nlcdh and is theory .",
    "one is the coefficient of the non - linear term @xmath184 . in nlcdh",
    ", the coefficient is given by just @xmath151 , but it is @xmath185 in the is theory .",
    "the other is the last term of eq .",
    "( eqn : bulk_is ) , which does not appear in nlcdh .    as was shown in sec .",
    "[ chap : numeri ] , the hydrodynamic equation is stabilized by the non - linear term in nlcdh . in the is theory , we could not show the stability of the is theory analytically because of the last term of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : bulk_is ] ) .",
    "however , the numerical simulation shows that the is theory is more stable than the truncated is theory ( or lcdh ) .",
    "we calculate the shock formation and the fluid expansion with the same parameters and initial conditions , as was discussed in sec . [",
    "sec : shock ] and sec : landau , in the is theory .",
    "we found that the numerical calculations are stable as in the case of nlcdh and the behaviors of the is theory is similar to that of the nlcdh . in fig [ entropy ]",
    ", we plot the entropy production as a function of time in the calculation of the expansion to vacuum with the landau initial condition .",
    "one can see that the entropy production of nlcdh and the is theory is smaller than that of lcdh ( or the truncated is theory ) and the is theory is most close to the ideal fluid .",
    "the similar reduction due to non - linear terms also appears even for the shear viscosity as was numerically studied in @xcite . in the bulk case",
    ", we can show explicitly that the suppression happens because of the minimum value of @xmath30 guanteed by the nonlinear term . in the case of the full",
    "is theory , it is not obvious why this happens , but surprizingly the net effect is very close to ours .",
    "the non - periodic oscillation appears even in the is theory .",
    "it should , however , be noted that in these simulations , we introduced the additional viscosity @xcite . if we do not use the additional viscosity , we can not implement stable numerical simulations even in",
    "the is theory .    .",
    "the dotted , solid and dashed lines represent the calculations of lcdh , nlcdh and the is theory , respectively . ]",
    "it is important to note that the is theory also can be derived in our formulation .",
    "so far , we employed the memory effect between @xmath20 and @xmath186 for simplicity reasons",
    ". suppose we apply the same procedure to @xmath187 and @xmath188 by using the same memory function , @xmath189this leads to the following equation for @xmath5 , @xmath190this equation is nothing but the equation of the bulk viscosity in the is theory ( see appendix [ app : is ] ) .",
    "it can also be derived in the framework of the  internal - variable theory , although the concept of thermodynamics should be extended .",
    "see appendix [ app : is ] and [ app : ivt ] , respectively .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ map ]    on the other hand , our result is different from that of the is theory .",
    "we showed that the is theory also seems to be applicable to the ultra - relativistic cases , although we could not show the positivity of the mass explicitly .",
    "the quantitative difference between our theory and the is theory is very small but the is theory is more close to the behavior to the ideal fluid .",
    "it is also interesting to mention that the equation of the is theory can be derived even in our formulation if we introduce a very peculiar form of thermodynamical variable to introduce the memory effect .",
    "although our choice seems more natural and simple from the point of view of the memory function on thermodynamical forces , we need experimental and other theoretical supports to decide the appropriate forms of thermodynamical variables .",
    "the way of extending the thermodynamics to irreversible domain is not unique ( see also the discussion in appendix app : ivt and ref .",
    "the schematic mapping of different theories are summarized in fig .",
    "it should be noted that to derive the is equation in the memory function method , we have to break the extensivity of currents because we employ the memory effect to the quantity proportional to @xmath191 as is shown in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ouris1 ] ) .",
    "we are interested in the dynamics of fluid , which can not be described by the simple boltzmann equation .",
    "it is not obvious but if the theory is still applicable to the dynamics of a dilute gas as in the non - relativistic case , the equation should be justified from the kinetic argument such as the moment method . as a matter of fact",
    ", the problem of the simplest moment method is known and there are several proposals for the improvement stru .",
    "the derivation of our equaiton from the kinetic point of view is still an open problem .",
    "t. koide acknowledges useful discussions with d. jou .",
    "this work is supported by faperj and cnpq .",
    "similar to the extended irreversible thermodynamics , the equations of irreversible currents are derived by applying the algebraic positivity of the entropy production in the is theory . in the derivation of israel and stewart , they used two equations ; one is the definition of the entropy four flux , @xmath192and the other is the expression of @xmath193 , which is assumed by the general quadratic form , @xmath194here @xmath195 denotes the entropy density in equilibrium for given temperature @xmath117 and chemical potential @xmath196    by using the algebraic positivity of the entropy production @xmath197 as usual , we obtain @xmath198    the derivation of israel and stewart depends on the validity of the assumption ( [ eqn : is_s ] ) . to derive this equation , it is usefull to derive the following relation in the equilibrium , @xmath199here , the subscript @xmath200 indicates quantities in equilibrium and @xmath201    the fundamental assumption used by israel and stewart is the so called release of variations , which assumes that ( [ eq_rel ] ) stays valid for a virtual displacement from a equilibrium state to an arbitrary neighbouring state , @xmath202 here , the last term @xmath203 denotes the contribution from the second order deviation from equilibrium .",
    "this postulate enables us to determine the form of the entropy flux in a near equilibrium system perturbatively .",
    "by addition of ( [ euler_cov ] ) and ( [ eqn : is_assum ] ) the the entropy four flux in the is theory is obtained , @xmath204where @xmath193  is an undetermined second order term in the deviations @xmath205 ,  @xmath206 .",
    "we introduce , again , the energy - momentum tensor and particle flux as follows ; @xmath207it should be noted that , different from the extended irreversible thermodynamics , the thermodynamic variables @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath208 satisfy the usual thermodynamic relations by construction . by using eqs .",
