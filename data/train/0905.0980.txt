    "in quantum state discrimination one should determine the state of a quantum system based on the outcome of a certain measurement , and assuming that the system may be prepared in a state chosen from a given list of possible candidates .",
    "of course , when the candidate states are not orthogonal , basic quantum mechanics dictates that no measurement can distinguish perfectly between them .",
    "the objective is therefore to choose some figure of merit characterizing the quality of the state discrimination and optimize it over the space of allowed quantum measurements .",
    "this procedure , known as quantum state discrimination or quantum hypothesis testing @xcite , plays a relevant role in the characterization of signals and devices and , in turn , in the development of quantum technology .",
    "the two main paradigms of state discrimination are unambiguous identification @xcite and ( ambiguous ) minimum error discrimination @xcite . in the first method ,",
    "to discriminate among @xmath1 states one searches a measurement with @xmath2 outcomes , where the additional result accounts for inconclusive detection , and in turn allows the conclusive determination in the remaining cases . on the other hand , in ambiguous discrimination one",
    "looks for a measurement with @xmath1 outcomes , always leading to a determination of the state , while accepting the possibility of a wrong inference . in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to the second method , which basically consists in looking for the optimal measurement that minimizes the probability of errors , _",
    "i.e _ the overall probability of a misidentification . for the discrimination between two states , pure or mixed",
    ", the optimal measurement and the minimum error probability had been derived by helstrom @xcite .",
    "if @xmath0 copies of the system are available the scaling of the error probability with the number of copies may be expressed using the so - called quantum chernoff bound @xmath3 @xcite . in particular",
    ", it has been proved that @xmath3 defines a meaningful distinguishability measure when one has to solve the problem of discriminating two sources that output many identical copies of two quantum states .",
    "in addition , when considering two states that are infinitesimally close , the quantum chernoff bound induces a metric on the manifold of quantum states .",
    "in this paper we study the discrimination problem for two ground states or two thermal states of the ising model in a transverse magnetic field , which represents a paradigmatic example of system which undergoes a second order quantum phase transition ( qpt ) .",
    "we consider the system both at zero and finite temperature , and address discrimination of states corresponding to different values of the coupling parameter .",
    "in particular , we evaluate the error probability for single - copy discrimination , the chernoff bound for @xmath0-copy discrimination in the asymptotic limit , and the chernoff metric for the discrimination of infinitesimally close states .",
    "we are interested in the scaling properties of the above quantities with the coupling itself , the temperature and the size of the system .",
    "moreover , we look for the optimal value of the field that minimizes the probability of error and maximizes both the chernoff bound and the corresponding metric .",
    "it turns out that criticality is a resource for quantum discrimination of states . indeed , at zero temperature the critical point signs a minimum in the probability of error and a divergence in the qcb metric .",
    "remarkably , despite the fact that chernoff metric is associated to quantum discrimination and the bures metric is related to quantum estimation @xcite , these different measures show the same critical behavior and carry the same information about the qpt of the system @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ isingmodel ]",
    "we introduce the model . in section [ qsdiscrim ]",
    "we review the basic elements of quantum state discrimination and also illustrate the notion of quantum chernoff metric for the ising model . in section [ tzero ]",
    "we study the distinguishability of states at zero temperature , both for the case of few spins and then in the thermodynamic limit . in section [ tfinite ] we consider the effects of temperature and the scaling properties of the metric .",
    "section [ conclusions ] closes the paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "we consider the one - dimensional ising model of size @xmath4 as an example of system which undergoes a zero - temperature quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "the model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath5 where the @xmath6 are pauli operators for the @xmath7-th site .",
    "we also assume periodic boundary conditions @xmath8 .",
    "as the temperature and the field @xmath9 are varied one may identify different physical regions . at zero temperature ,",

    "( [ eq : ising_diag ] ) holds in the sector with even number of fermions . in this case ,",

    "suppose we have a quantum system which may be prepared in different states @xmath30 , @xmath31 , chosen from a given set , with _ a priori _ probability @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "a discrimination problem arises in any situation where the system is presented to an experimenter who has to infer the state of system by performing a measurement .",
    "the states are known , as well as the _ a priori _ probabilities , but we do nt know which state has been actually sent to the observer . the simplest case occurs when the system may be prepared in two possible states , described by the density matrices @xmath34 and @xmath35 , with _ a priori _ probabilities @xmath36 and @xmath37 . any strategy for the ( ambiguous ) discrimination between these two states amounts to define a two - outcomes povm @xmath38 on the system , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xmath41 . after observing the outcome @xmath42 the observer infers that the state of the system is @xmath43 .",

    "the problem may be addressed using the above formulas upon replacing @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "we thus need to analyze the quantity @xmath59 .",
    "it turns out that in the asymptotic limit of large @xmath0 the error probability decreases exponentially with @xmath0 as @xmath60 where the quantity @xmath3 is called the _ quantum chernoff bound _ ( qcb ) and may be evaluated as follows @xcite @xmath61\\:.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for pure states qcb achieves its superior limit , which is given in terms of the overlap between the two states @xmath62 .",
    "the qcb introduces a measure of distinguishability for density operators which acquires an operational meaning in the asymptotic limit . for a fixed probability of error @xmath49 ,",
    "the larger is the @xmath3 , the smaller the number of copies of @xmath34 and @xmath35 we will need in order to distinguish them .    upon considering two nearby states",
    "@xmath57 and @xmath63 , the qcb induces the following distance over the manifold of quantum states @xmath64 where the @xmath65 s are the eigenvectors of @xmath66 . in the following",
    "we will consider infinitesimally close states obtained upon varying a hamiltonian parameter @xmath67 , and @xmath68 will correspond to @xmath69 .",
    "the above definition means that the bigger is the qcb distance , the smaller is the asymptotic error probability of discriminating a given states from its close neighbors .    in the following",
    "we will consider discrimination for ground and thermal states . in this case",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath57 are those of the hamiltonian and the distance may be written as the sum of two contributions @xmath70 where @xmath71 refers to the classical part since it only depends on the boltzmann weights of the eigenstates in the density operator , whereas @xmath72 to the nonclassical one because it explicitly depends on the dependence of the eigenstates from the parameter of interest .",
    "if we consider the ising model of the previous section and address discrimination of states labeled by different values of the coupling @xmath73 , the qcb distance can be expressed by the metric @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "we have @xcite @xmath76 recent results about the chernoff bound metric @xmath77 @xcite have shown that it may be used to investigate the phase diagram the ising model , i.e. to identify , in terms of different scaling with temperature , quasiclassical and quantum - critical regions .",
    "these results extend recent ones obtained using the bures metric @xmath78 ( or the fidelity ) @xcite _ i.e _ @xmath79 in turn , one has the relation @xmath80 which shows that the bures and the qcb metric have the same divergent behavior i.e. one metric diverges iff the other does .",
    "then one can exploit the results on the scaling behavior of the bures metric derived in @xcite to discriminate quantum states .",
    "moreover , in the following we will see that when the system is in its ground state , @xmath81 whereas at increasing temperature @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",

    "we address the discrimination problem at zero temperature by evaluating the probability of error and the qcb metric , pointing out scaling properties , and minimizing ( maximizing ) them as a function of the external field .",

    ", the sum on the classical part of the qcb metric may be replaced by the integral @xmath198 , thus leading to @xmath199 this is a good approximation in the limit @xmath200 because the upper integration limit @xmath201 becomes arbitrarily close to @xmath202 .",
    "the first integral is bounded by @xmath203 .",
    "the bounding integrals scale as @xmath204 and the first integral must scale in the same way for @xmath200 .",
    "the second term is upper bounded by @xmath205 .",
    "therefore , since the bounding integral scales as @xmath206 , @xmath193 must scale as @xmath206 to the highest order .",
    "observe that in the quantum - critical region @xmath207 is extensive , whereas at the critical point it has a superextensive behavior @xmath208 .",
    "the nonclassical element scales algebraically with temperature and in the zero temperature limit it diverges , matching the ground state behavior that we described in the previous section .",
    "these results remark that criticality provide a resource for quantum state discrimination , and that the discrimination of quantum states is indeed improved upon approaching the qcp .",
    "we have addressed the problem of discriminating two ground states or two thermal states corresponding to different values of the coupling constant in the one - dimensional quantum ising model .",
    "we have analyzed both short and long chains with the aim of assessing the role of criticality ( pseudo criticality for short chains ) in single - copy and many - copy discrimination as well as in the discrimination of infinitesimally closed states .    at zero temperature both",
    ", the error probability for single - copy discrimination , and the chernoff bound for @xmath0-copy discrimination in the asymptotic limit , are optimized by choosing the external field as the geometric mean of the two ( pseudo ) critical points . in this regime ,",
    "the relevant parameter governing both quantities is the ratio between the two values of the coupling constant . on the other hand ,",
    "the chernoff metric is equal to the bures metric and is maximized at the ( pseudo ) critical point .",
    "for finite temperature we have analyzed in some details the scaling properties of all the above quantities and have derived the optimal external field .",
    "we found that the effect of finite temperature is twofold . on the one hand , critical values of the field",
    "are optimal only for large values of the coupling constants . on the other hand , the ratio between the couplings is no longer the only relevant parameter for both the error probability and the chernoff bound , which also depends on the absolute difference .",
    "the ratio between the chernoff metric and the bures metric decreases continuously , but not monotonically , for increasing temperature and approaches @xmath209 in the limit of high - temperature .    in conclusion , upon considering the one - dimensional ising model as a paradigmatic example",
    "we have quantitatively shown how and to which extent criticality may represent a resource for state discrimination in many - body systems .",
