    "systems composed of self - propelled ( active ) particles represent a class of out - of - equilibrium fluids that exhibit behavior not observed in other fluid systems .",
    "one well - studied example is the phase separation of moderately dense self - propelled fluid systems without attractive interactions @xcite .",
    "it is of fundamental interest to understand differences between these novel types of active fluids and equilibrium fluids . in particular , many groups strive to determine whether and what concepts known from the theory of equilibrium fluids can be used to describe active fluids @xcite .",
    "one of the questions discussed recently is the glassy dynamics and the glass transition in self - propelled fluids and their comparison to the corresponding phenomena in equilibrium fluids @xcite .",
    "part of the motivation to analyze the glassy dynamics of active materials stems from experiments .",
    "there is ample experimental evidence that active fluids may exhibit glassy dynamics .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite found , for instance , that migrating cells exhibited glassy dynamics , such as a diminishing self diffusion coefficient and heterogeneous dynamics , as the cell density increases .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite found signatures of glassy dynamics in embryonic tissues .",
    "more recently , garcia _ et al . _",
    "@xcite found an amorphous solidification process in collective motion of a cellular monolayer . at larger scale , ant traffic @xcite and ant aggregates @xcite",
    "were shown to display physical processes reminiscent of glassy solids . to understand the glassy dynamics of cells or ant colonies , it is important to understand what are the general features of glassy dynamics that are preserved when a fluid is driven out of equilibrium , and what new behavior may emerge that does not have an equilibrium counterpart .    on the theoretical front ,",
    "these experimental investigations are complemented by a large number of simulational studies of glassy dynamics which have mainly focused on the narrower class of self - propelled particles @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed how activity and aligning velocity interactions excite vibrational modes in an amorphous solid near jamming .",
    "hard particles with self - propulsion were studied in two and three dimensions , the main outcome being that the equilibrium glass transition is shifted to larger densities when either the magnitude @xcite or the persistence time @xcite of the self - propulsion is increased .",
    "simulational studies of systems with non - aligning continuous interactions started with wysocki _",

    "@xcite , who simulated a dense system of active particles .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated the phase diagram of a dense active system as a function of density , activity and thermal noise , and identified a glassy phase in the high - density , small self - propulsion speed regime , but the detailed structure and glassy dynamics were not analyzed .",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced an active version of the binary lennard - jones mixture ( the kob - andersen model @xcite ) that we also study in the present work .",
    "they found that , upon increasing the magnitude of the self - propulsion , the long - time dynamics speeds up leading to a disappearance of the glass phase , in apparent agreement with hard sphere studies .",
    "we shall present below a very different qualitative picture of the glass transition in systems of self - propelled particles .    on the theoretical side , berthier and kurchan @xcite",
    "have used a general spin - glass model to argue that systems which have a glass transition in equilibrium could also exhibit a glass transition when driven away from equilibrium through self - propulsion .",
    "they concluded that although the specific features of the transition may change with the nature of the non - thermal driving force , such as its location , general signatures exhibited by thermal glass - forming systems should still be relevant .",
    "farage and brader @xcite attempted to extend the mode - coupling theory for the glass transition to account for activity , and also concluded that self - propulsion could shift , but not destroy , the glass transition .",
    "very recently , nandi @xcite proposed a phenomenological extension of random - first order transition theory to study active glasses .    in an effort to construct a minimal non - trivial model to understand",
    "the competition between activity and glassy dynamics , we @xcite have started a simulational investigation of a self - propelled version of the kob - andersen lennard - jones binary mixture that is different from the model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite in many aspects .",
    "our goal is to construct a model where self - propulsion is the unique source of motion , which neglects aligning interactions , obeys continuous equations of motions and where the equilibrium limit can be taken continuously . to this end , we consider a system with continuous interactions in which the self - propulsion evolves according to an ornstein - uhlenbeck stochastic process .",
    "this self - propulsion model was introduced by one of us earlier @xcite , as a continuous representation of the monte - carlo dynamics proposed in @xcite .",
    "an essentially identical model was independently introduced and studied by maggi _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . the general class of model active systems in which the self - propulsion evolves according to an ornstein - uhlenbeck process was recently named active ornstein - uhlenbeck particles ( aoups ) systems @xcite .",
    "in this class of systems , the evolution of the self - propulsion is controlled by two parameters .",
    "an effective temperature quantifies the strength of the self - propulsion force , and a persistence time controls the duration of the persistent self - propelled motion",
    ". one attractive feature of this model is that the departure from thermal equilibrium is characterized by one parameter , the persistence time , because in the limit of vanishing persistence time the system becomes equivalent to an equilibrium thermal system at the temperature equal to the effective temperature",
    ". such continuous approach to the equilibrium situation is an attractive feature of the model , which is impossible for both active brownian @xcite or run - and - rumble @xcite particle models .",
    "this is also very different from alternative approaches in which the active force acts in addition to thermal motion , where fluidisation of the system by addition of active forces is then automatically guaranteed @xcite .    in a previous short account of our results @xcite",
    ", we showed that with increasing departure from equilibrium for a range of effective temperatures the dynamics can both speed up or slow down .",
    "we showed that this effect can be qualitatively rationalized within a mode - coupling - like theory for the dynamics of active systems ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed presentation of the theory ) .",
    "we found that the important ingredient of this theory was incorporation of the spatial correlations of the velocities of the individual active particles .",
    "these velocity correlations have no equilibrium counterpart .",
    "very recently , the existence and properties of velocity correlations in active particles systems were independently studied by marconi _",
    "_ @xcite .    in the present article",
    ", we present a very comprehensive set of numerical results regarding the structure and glassy dynamics of the self - propelled kob - andersen lennard - jones binary mixture which we introduced earlier @xcite .",
    "we focus on the dependence of the glassy dynamics on the departure from thermal equilibrium , which we quantify by the value of the persistence time of the self - propulsion . by increasing the persistence time from zero to a finite value we continuously move from an overdamped thermal brownian system through a moderately non - equilibrium system and then to a strongly non - equilibrium self - propelled system . along the way , we systematically study changes in the structural and dynamic properties of the system .",
    "overall , our results suggest that activity induces profound changes in the detailed structure of the nonequilibrium fluid , but the glassy dynamics of active particles , despite taking place far from thermal equilibrium @xcite , is qualitatively similar to that observed in equilibrium fluids .",
    "we find that active particles display slow dynamics , complex time dependencies of relaxation functions , and spatially heterogeneous dynamics with only quantitative differences between equilibrium and active systems .",

    "we simulate a system of interacting self - propelled particles moving in a viscous medium .",
    "the motion of the particles is solely due to an internal driving force that evolves according to the ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "the absence of thermal noise qualifies our model as being ` athermal ' .",
    "such model should be applicable for large enough active particles where thermal noise is negligible compared to their self - propulsion .",

    "we simulate the classic kob - andersen 80:20 binary mixture at a number density @xmath19 to study the glassy dynamics . at such large density , the physics of phase separation is irrelevant and we can focus exclusively on the glassy dynamics of an homogeneous active fluid .",

    "a few runs which focused on the small wave - vector behavior of certain correlation functions used systems of 27000 particles . since the equations of motion allow for a drift of the center of mass , we corrected for this center of mass drift in calculating time correlation functions .",

    "we note that @xmath43 for @xmath29 is nearly identical to @xmath43 obtained over - damped brownian dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "however , for the larger persistence times there is an enhancement of the structure as shown by the increased height of the first peak of @xmath43 .",

    "the splitting into three peaks is typically not observed .",
    "these results suggest that the self - propulsion can promote the presence of structures that are not favored in the thermal system , indicating that the local structure of the active fluid is presumably very hard to predict from the sole knowledge of the pair potential .",

    "we note that the influence of the persistence time on the peak is much more pronounced that the influence of the effective temperature .",

    "we note , for later reference , that the relative change of the peak height as temperature decreases is actually weaker for the largest persistence time than it is for the equilibrium model .    the pair distribution functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 at @xmath49 for @xmath29 , @xmath31 , @xmath33 , and @xmath36 .",

    "[ gr065 ] .",
    "note that @xmath49 is the lowest effective temperature where we have equilibrated simulations for @xmath41 .",
    "we find that with increasing persistence time the height of the first peak of @xmath53 in fig .",
    "[ gr065](a ) increases and the splitting of the second peak becomes more pronounced .",
    "furthermore , the width of the first peak decreases , which suggests an increased ordering .",
    "the enhanced structure is more pronounced when one examines @xmath54 , which is shown in fig .",

    "recall that @xmath55 , thus this peak corresponds to an increased probability of finding another @xmath56 particle in the first neighbor shell of a @xmath56 particle .",
    "an interesting question , which is beyond the scope of this work , is how the self - propulsion influences the relative populations of locally favored structures @xcite of the system .",
    "answering this question could lead to a new route to make desired structures more favorable in dense liquids .",
    "what we do observe here is that increasing persistence times of the self - propulsion changes the local structure of a dense binary fluid in a highly non - trivial manner .",
    "this implies that the active lennard - jones fluid driven by nonequilibrium self - propulsion forces behaves a dense fluid with thermodynamic properties that are quantitatively distinct from the original equilibrium model , and it becomes a ` different ' fluid .",
    "most theories of the equilibrium fluid dynamics use as their input the pair distribution function or quantities that can be calculated from this function @xcite .",
    "while deriving a theory for the dynamics of active systems @xcite , we discovered that the active fluid dynamics is also influenced by correlations of velocities of individual active particles .",
    "this influence appears in two places .",
    "first , the short - time dynamics can be analyzed exactly and one can show that it is determined by a pair correlation function of the particles velocities .",
    "second , within an approximate theory , which is similar in spirit to the well - known theory for the dynamics of glass forming fluids , the mode - coupling theory @xcite , the long - time dynamics is influenced by that same correlation function .",
    "we should emphasize that this correlation function does not have an equilibrium analogue .",
    "it becomes structure - less in the limit of vanishing persistence time , _",
    "i.e. _ when our system becomes equivalent to an equilibrium ( thermal ) system . we should also mention that the existence and importance of velocity correlations in active particles systems were also stressed recently by marconi _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "our theoretical analysis therefore leads us to the following correlation function of the particle velocities , @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ velcor ] ) , @xmath58 is the velocity of particle @xmath2 , see eq .",
    "( [ drdt ] ) , and thus @xmath59 quantifies longitudinal spatial correlations of the velocities of the individual particles .",
    "it turns out that both the wave - vector dependence of @xmath59 and its overall magnitude change with our two control parameters , @xmath11 and @xmath7 . for this reason",
    ", we first show the changes in the wave - vector dependence by presenting velocity correlations normalized by their infinite wave - vector limit , @xmath60 , and then we show the changes in the overall magnitude by presenting the infinite wave - vector limit , @xmath61 .",
    "we note that @xmath61 is related to the average magnitude of the velocity , @xmath62    in fig .",
    "[ omega](a ) we show @xmath60 for @xmath41 at @xmath63 , 1.0 , 0.8 , and 0.65 .",
    "we find that , possibly except at the smallest wave - vectors , there is very little change in @xmath60 with decreasing @xmath11 at fixed @xmath7 , and we find this to be the case for every @xmath7 .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ omega](b ) , there is a large change in @xmath60 with @xmath7 at constant @xmath64 .",
    "thus , the increase of the velocity correlations is a consequence of the increased persistence time , but this structural measure also does not change significantly with decreasing effective temperature .",
    "this trend is similar to the observation made for the pair distribution function .",
    "( a ) velocity correlations as measured by @xmath65 for @xmath66 , 1.0 , 0.8 , and 0.65 for @xmath41 .",
    "( b ) velocity correlations as measured by @xmath65 for @xmath29 , @xmath31 , @xmath33 , and @xmath36 at a fixed @xmath64 .",
    "( c ) @xmath67 for @xmath29 , @xmath31 , @xmath33 , and @xmath36 as a function of @xmath11.,width=307 ]    we note two different aspects of the increasing velocity correlations .",
    "first , @xmath60 develops finite wave - vector oscillatory structure which , roughly speaking , follows that of the static structure factor .",
    "second , @xmath60 develops a peak at the zero wave - vector , which indicates growing velocity correlation length .",
    "a detailed investigation of this latter feature is left for a future study .",
    "here we only note that at @xmath68 and @xmath41 , which corresponds to a liquid state , this length reaches the value of about 2.6 particle diameter ( recall that this correlation length scale is not even defined for brownian particles ) . while still modest , such a correlation length is longer than any other structural length in an equilibrium fluid with similar dynamics .",
    "thus , increasing the persistence time induces the emergence of non - trivial spatial correlations in the active fluid that are fully nonequilibrium in nature .    in fig .",
    "[ omega](c ) we present the dependence of the overall magnitude of @xmath59 on @xmath11 and @xmath7 by plotting @xmath69 .",
    "we found @xcite that this quantity is a measure of the intermediate time dynamics ( under the assumption that there is a separation of time scales between short - time ballistic motion and the long - time motion heavily influenced by the time - dependent internal friction ) .",
    "we show the dependence of @xmath69 on @xmath11 for @xmath29 , @xmath31 , @xmath33 , @xmath36 listed from top to bottom . since at a given effective temperature @xmath11 the strength of the self - propulsion force is @xmath70 , an increase of the @xmath7 at fixed @xmath11 will result in an overall decrease of @xmath61 . if the self - propulsion force dominates the velocity correlations , one would expect that @xmath71 , thus @xmath72 , and we find that there is an approximate linear decrease of @xmath73 with @xmath11 for @xmath29 .",
    "however , @xmath73 no longer linearly decreases linearly with decreasing @xmath11 for larger @xmath7 , and @xmath74 for @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , there is an increased influence of the particle interactions with increasing persistence time , which is consistent with findings of marconi _",
    "physically , this implies that the intermediate - time dynamics slows down more rapidly with decreasing the effective temperature for large persistence times than for small ones .",
    "one fundamental feature of glassy dynamics is the dramatic slowing down of the dynamics accompanied by little change in the two - body static structure . in the previous section we found little change in the structure with decreasing the effective temperature @xmath11 at fixed persistence time @xmath7 . in this section",
    "we examine the dramatic slow down of the dynamics upon changing the control parameters in the same way , _",
    "i.e. _ with decreasing the effective temperature at fixed persistence time .      the self - intermediate scattering function @xmath75 from @xmath37 down to the lowest temperature we could equilibrate for ( a ) @xmath29 , ( b ) @xmath76 , ( c ) @xmath77 , and ( d ) @xmath78 for all the simulated temperatures listed in sec .  [ sim ] .",
    "in all cases , nonequilibrium glassy dynamics is observed as @xmath11 decreases.,width=307 ]    to examine the dynamics we study the self - intermediate scattering function for the @xmath44 particles @xmath79 while we only present results for the more abundant , larger @xmath44 particles , similar conclusions are drawn if one examines the dynamics of the smaller @xmath56 particles .",
    "we choose @xmath80 , which is around the first peak of the partial static structure factor calculated for the @xmath44 particles .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ fs ] is @xmath75 for representative values of the persistence time .",
    "while we observed little change in the structure with decreasing @xmath11 at fixed @xmath7 , we do see a dramatic slowing down of the dynamics , in the sense that the relaxation becomes very slow at low temperatures .",
    "also , as is commonly observed in equilibrium supercooled liquids , the functional form of the time decay of the correlation functions is relatively independent of temperature , and is well - described by a stretched exponential form that also depends only weakly on the persistence time .",
    "therefore , we now focus on the relaxation time @xmath81 of @xmath75 which we define as when @xmath82 .      shown in fig .",
    "[ tau ] is the @xmath83 relaxation time , @xmath81 , as a function of the effective temperature , @xmath11 , for all the persistence times studied in this work .",
    "also shown with ` b ' symbols is @xmath81 for overdamped brownian dynamics simulations of the same system @xcite .",
    "note that at small @xmath7 and a fixed @xmath11 , the active system relaxes faster than the thermal brownian system at @xmath84 .",
    "the relaxation time becomes larger than that of the over - damped brownian system for @xmath85 .",
    "this non - monotonic dependence of the relaxation time on the persistence time was reported previously , and a mode - coupling like theory was developed that also predicted a non - monotonic change of the relaxation time with the persistence time @xcite .",
    "the physics behind the non - monotonic behavior is a competition between increasing structure in the velocity correlations ( speeding up the dynamics ) and an increase in the local structure ( slowing down the dynamics ) as @xmath7 increases .",
    "the dependence of the relaxation time @xmath81 on @xmath11 for all the persistence times studied in this work . the results for over - damped brownian dynamics from ref .",
    "@xcite is shown using ` b ' symbols .",
    "note that on the scale of the figure the results for the three shortest persistence times are almost identical , whereas larger persistence times seem to promote , rather than suppress , the glassy dynamics.,width=307 ]    below we shall analyze in great detail the dramatic increase of @xmath81 with decreasing effective temperature .",
    "first , it is useful to notice that the dynamics in the high effective temperature liquid also bears a non - trivial dependence on the persistence time . for @xmath86 , for instance , we observe that @xmath81 increases by about one order of magnitude between brownian dynamics and our largest simulated @xmath7 .",
    "this change mirrors the increase in @xmath87 reported in fig .",
    "[ omega](c ) .",
    "this is reasonable as @xmath87 controls the intermediate - time dynamics , and it thus affects also the structural relaxation time in the high - temperature fluid , where glassy effects at long times are absent .",
    "in contrast to the small changes in structure with decreasing effective temperature shown in the previous section , sec .",
    "[ struc ] , there is a very large increase in the relaxation time with a small decrease of the effective temperature .",
    "we note that changing @xmath7 can dramatically change the structure , and thus it makes sense to examine the glass transition at a fixed @xmath7 and using @xmath11 as the control parameter .",
    "finally , we note that increasing departure from the thermal equilibrium does not ` fluidize ' the glassy system under study , and neither does the glass transition disappear completely , contrary to previous reports @xcite .",
    "the difference stems from the fact that in the model of @xcite , active forces act in addition to brownian noise , so that the bath temperature is in fact not the correct control parameter to describe the glassy dynamics .",
    "mode - coupling - like power law fits @xmath88 for ( a ) @xmath29 , ( b ) @xmath31 , ( c ) @xmath33 , and ( d ) @xmath36 . in all cases , there is a modest intermediate time regime where the power - law fit holds , as commonly found in equilibrium supercooled liquids.,width=307 ]    one common way to examine glassy dynamics in thermal systems is to investigate power - law fits of the relaxation time inspired by the mode - coupling theory @xcite .",
    "these fits result in the so - called mode - coupling transition temperature @xmath89 , which is interpreted as a crossover between a moderately supercooled regime where mode - coupling theory is applicable and a strongly supercooled regime where the dynamics is thought to be dominated by somewhat vaguely defined hopping events .",
    "the development of a mode - coupling - like dynamic theory for active systems @xcite suggests that similar analysis could be performed for active glassy dynamics .",
    "we examine a mode - coupling like regime by fitting @xmath90 for @xmath11 lower than the onset temperature , which we define as the highest temperature where @xmath81 deviates from the high temperature arrhenius behavior ( discussed further below ) . shown in fig .",
    "[ mctfit ] are the fits for four representative persistence times . for each persistence time the mode - coupling",
    "like fits provide a reasonable description of the data for around two decades of slowing down .",
    "like for thermal systems , there are deviations from the mode - coupling behavior at the lowest effective temperatures that we could simulate .",
    "notice that the quality ( or poorness ) of such power law fit does not seem to be very different between brownian and self - propelled dynamics .",
    "a different result was obtained for self - propelled disks where the quality of the fits seemed to improve with increasing the persistence time @xcite . the present result for the binary lennard - jones model then provides a counter - example suggesting that the finding for the hard disk system is not universal .",

    ". fits to a mode - coupling theory power law also result in a monotonic increase of the mode - coupling transition temperature .",
    "overall , these findings suggest that once the ( non - trivial and far - from - equilibrium ) physics of the high - temperature fluid is scaled out , the resulting glassy dynamics evolves rather smoothly with an increase of the persistence time and does not show any striking qualitative feature that is not also typically observed in standard models for equilibrium supercooled liquids .",
    "a remarkable conclusion is that for the present model , the increase of the persistence promotes glassy behavior , rather than suppresses it .",
    "these results therefore show that the idea @xcite that self - propulsion can be universally interpreted as a driving force acting against , and potentially suppressing , the equilibrium glassy dynamics is not correct .",
    "we conclude instead that the interplay between self - propulsion and glassy dynamics is much more subtle @xcite and the outcome can not easily be predicted on phenomenological grounds . whereas for hard particles",
    ", the glass transition is depressed from its equilibrium limit @xcite , the opposite behavior is found for the present lennard - jones model .",
    "capturing these features in an accurate microscopic theory represents therefore an important challenge for future work .",
    "we also found that the stokes - einstein relation @xmath115 was valid for small persistence times at effective temperatures above the onset of supercooling .",
    "however , for the largest persistence times studied in this work , the stokes - einstein relation is never valid . at higher effective temperatures @xmath116 decreases ,",
    "reaches a minimum , then begins to increase for effective temperatures when the liquid is supercooled .",
    "however , in the glassy regime corresponding to large relaxation times it appears that @xmath116 follows a master - curve , which provides additional support to the idea that the glassy dynamics of the supercooled self - propelled liquid shares similar characteristics to the dynamics of equilibrium supercooled liquids .",
    "we finished the study of glassy dynamics by examining correlations in the relaxation of the individual particles , _",
    "i.e. _ dynamic heterogeneity . to this end",
    "we analyzed a dynamic susceptibility @xmath119 which is a measure of the fluctuations of the self - intermediate scattering function .",
    "since our system is at constant density and concentration , our dynamic susceptibility should be considered a lower bound to the dynamic susceptibility that allows for all the fluctuations in the system @xcite .",

    "one possibility is to employ large - scale simulations to measure the low wave - vector behavior of a four - point dynamic structure factor .",

    ", the detailed numerical results presented here for the nonequilibrium glassy dynamics of self - propelled particles suggest that the structure and dynamics of a ` simple ' ( i.e. non - glassy ) dense active fluid change profoundly with increasing departure from thermal equilibrium , quantified by the persistence time of the self - propulsion . with increasing @xmath7 correlations of the particles positions become more pronounced and spatial correlations of the velocities develop .",
    "the dynamics initially speed up but at longer persistence time they slow down and dynamic correlations develop mirroring the correlations of equal time velocities . these changes in the normal fluid structure and dynamics become more pronounced as the effective temperature decreases and the glassy regime is entered .",
    "however , while the details of the slowing down depend quantitatively on the persistence time , the overall picture of glassy dynamics is largely similar for different persistence times . in other words ,",
    "the evolution of the glassy dynamics with decreasing effective temperature in active systems is qualitatively similar to the evolution of the dynamics in thermal glass - forming systems with decreasing the temperature .",
    "this broad conclusion implies that self - propelled particles undergo a glass transition at low effective temperatures or large densities accompanied by a complex time dependence of time correlation functions , locally - caged particle dynamics , and spatially heterogeneous dynamics very much as in thermal equilibrium . despite the local injection of energy @xcite and violations of equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relations @xcite",
    "the overall phenomenon studied here is therefore best described as a nonequilibrium glass transition  @xcite .",
    "while this conclusion is broadly consistent with the experimental reports of glassy dynamics in active materials , it remains to be understood whether the present model of self - propelled particles and the generic concept of a nonequilibrium glass transition are sufficient to account for experimental observations .",
