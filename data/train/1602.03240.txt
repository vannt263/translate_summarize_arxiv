    "these results enable experimental access to the many theoretical studies on atomic spectra in squeezed reservoirs that have followed  @xcite , and demonstrate the utility of resonance fluorescence for the characterization of itinerant squeezed states , an important capability for the development of proposed schemes to enhance qubit readout with microwave - frequency squeezed light  @xcite .",
