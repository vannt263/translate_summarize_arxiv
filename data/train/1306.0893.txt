    "under different conditions for a domain @xmath4 , weighted norm estimates for solutions of linear and nonlinear equations have been studied by several authors ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , where the weight of interest is a power of the distance to the boundary @xmath5 .",
    "the class of muckenhoupt weights @xmath6 is a fundamental tool in real and harmonic analysis .",
    "the first non - trivial examples of weights in @xmath6 are the weights @xmath7 for @xmath8 .",
    "the results in @xcite show that in a domain whose boundary has dimension @xmath9 , if the domain is smooth enough then @xmath10 for @xmath11 . in @xcite",
    "this result has been generalized to some @xmath12-dimensional compact sets @xmath13 in @xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "they proved that @xmath16 for @xmath17 .    therefore thinking the domains on @xmath14 as complements of closed sets , it seems natural to try to consider the somehow heterogeneous situation in which the boundary shows different dimensions at different points . with that generality",
    "the problem looks hard . but with some extra hypotheses on the structure of @xmath5 some extensions are possible .",
    "the techniques used here extend naturally to general metric measure space @xmath0 satisfying the so called ahlfors condition , which is a particular case of space of homogeneous type .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section : general ]",
    "we give some definitions and notation on metric spaces and the hardy - littlewood maximal function of measures obtaining the finiteness of such function for certain measures .",
    "the main results of this note are contained in section  [ section : main results ] .",
    "there we prove that powers of the hardy - littlewood maximal function of measures belong to the muckenhoupt class and in some cases we can describe the behavior of such function giving a family of weights on metric measure spaces . in section  [ section : applications ] we give some applications .",
    "first we obtain weighted bounded estimates for gradients of solutions of polyharmonic equations and then we produce families of weights on some classical fractals .",
    "let @xmath18 be a set .",
    "a _ * quasi - distance * _ on @xmath18 is a non - negative symmetric function @xmath19 defined on @xmath20 such that @xmath21 if and only if @xmath22 , and there exists a constant @xmath23 such that the inequality @xmath24 holds for every @xmath25 .",
    "we will refer to @xmath26 as the triangle constant for @xmath19 .",
    "a quasi - distance @xmath19 on @xmath18 induces a topology through the neighborhood system given by the family of all subsets of @xmath18 containing a @xmath19-ball @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( see @xcite ) . in a quasi - metric space @xmath29",
    "the _ * diameter * _ of a subset @xmath30 is defined as @xmath31 and the distance between a point @xmath32 and a set @xmath30 is defined by @xmath33 .    throughout this paper @xmath29",

    "we shall say that @xmath0 is a _ * space of homogeneous type * _ if @xmath34 is a non - negative borel measure @xmath34 satisfying the _ * doubling condition * _ @xmath35 for some constant @xmath36 , for every @xmath32 and every @xmath28 .",

    "we shall now recall a basic property of spaces of homogeneous type that we shall need .",
    "this property is actually contained in @xcite , and reflects the fact that spaces of homogeneous type have finite metric ( or assouad ) dimension ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the expression _ * finite metric dimension * _ means that there exists a constant @xmath38 such that no ball of radius contains more than @xmath39 points of any @xmath40-disperse subset of @xmath18 .",

    "it is well known that if a quasi - metric space @xmath29 has finite metric dimension , then every bounded subset @xmath13 of @xmath18 is totally bounded , so that for every @xmath28 there exists a finite @xmath40-net on @xmath13 , whose cardinal depends on @xmath48 and on @xmath40 .",
    "on the other hand , every compact quasi - metric space with finite metric dimension carries a nontrivial doubling measure ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .    let @xmath0 be a space of homogeneous type . for a given locally integrable function @xmath49 , the _ * hardy - littlewood maximal operator * _ is given by @xmath50 where the supremum is taken over the family of the @xmath19-balls @xmath51 containing @xmath52 . since @xmath34 is doubling then @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( see @xcite ) .    the definition of the hardy - littlewood maximal operator can be extended to a non - negative borel measure @xmath56 such that every ball has finite @xmath56-measure by @xmath57 where the supremum is taken over the family of the @xmath19-balls @xmath51 containing @xmath52 . since @xmath34 is doubling , @xmath58 is equivalent to its centered version , i.e. @xmath59    when @xmath56 is a finite measure the analogous of the weak type inequality given above shows that @xmath60 is finite @xmath34-almost everywhere .",
    "we aim to give sufficient conditions other than the finiteness of @xmath56 in order to have the @xmath34-almost everywhere finiteness of @xmath60 .",
    "we shall deal with spaces of finite hausdorff dimension .",
    "some comments regarding the terminology are in order . in the bibliography belonging to geometric measure theory , such as @xcite ,",
    "an @xmath12-set @xmath30 is one for which @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the hausdorff measure of dimension @xmath12 . in some references related to problems of harmonic analysis and partial differential equations ,",
    "see for example @xcite , the expression @xmath12-set is used to name a set that supports a measure @xmath56 for which @xmath63 behaves as @xmath64 for @xmath40 small .",
    "this condition implies the above one . on the other hand",
    "when dealing with operators such as the hardy - littlewood maximal , the global behavior of the given set , aside its local behavior , becomes relevant . in this direction , again , two different terminologies appear in the literature .",
    "when there exists a measure @xmath56 such that @xmath63 behaves as @xmath64 for @xmath40 up to the diameter of the support of @xmath56 , which could be unbounded , the space is said to be @xmath12-ahlfors .",

    "this property is named normality .    for the sake of simplicity we shall adopt along this note the following definitions .",
