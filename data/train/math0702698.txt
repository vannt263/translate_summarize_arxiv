    "the strategy of the proof is as follows . for self - similar solutions to curve shortening flow",
    ", we can reduce the parabolic equation to an elliptic equation which describes self - similar solutions at a fixed positive time , e.g.  at @xmath39 .",
    "then we solve this elliptic equation with prescribed start point @xmath40 such that @xmath41 connects to infinity and is asymptotically close to the half - line @xmath25 .",

    "uniqueness follows from the observation that for a self - similarly expanding solution that intersects a family of self - similarly expanding solutions ( all solutions are self - similarly expanding under the same homotheties ) that are all asymptotic to a fixed half - line at infinity , the angle , at which these curves intersect , is monotone along the solution mentioned at the beginning .",
    "this follows from applying the gau - bonnet theorem and the divergence theorem and uses also the fact that we consider self - similarly expanding solutions to curve shortening flow .",

    "the problem of the existence of a smooth network , evolving by curve shortening flow and satisfying the balancing condition with an initial network not satisfying the balancing condition is raised in that paper . in the present paper",
    "we give a partial answer to this problem .",
    "+ the evolution of embedded networks , satisfying the balancing condition , arises naturally in two - dimensional multiphase systems , where the evolution of the interfaces between different phases can be modeled by curve shortening flow .",
    "this comes from the fact that in certain models the total energy of the interface is proportional to the total length of the interface , and curve shortening flow is the @xmath2-gradient flow of the length functional .",
