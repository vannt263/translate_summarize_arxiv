    "it is instructive to start with the single harmonic oscillator case first , i.e. @xmath101 and @xmath142 .",

    "evolving the operators in time ( in the heisenberg picture ) according to @xmath147 and @xmath148 and taking the time average , we notice that only the ( @xmath149 in number ) terms with equal number of @xmath150 and @xmath151 operators contribute @xmath152 these terms can be re - ordered , using the ccr , as alternating sequences of @xmath151 and @xmath150 , therefore giving @xmath153 for some appropriate combinatorial coefficients @xmath154 .",
    "one way to derive the latter is by first normal - ordering the terms in ( [ 2 ] ) and then re - expressing them in terms of @xmath155 .",
    "both steps are known in the literature @xcite @xmath156 and @xmath157 where @xmath158 are the stirling numbers of the first kind , so that @xmath159 from which we can read off the coefficients @xmath154 introduced above @xmath160    we can easily generalise to the case of @xmath161 noninteracting bosons , for which the above results give @xmath162 note that the knowledge of the values @xmath138 is equivalent to the information of how many particles occupy each of the excitation levels of the trap , since from their generating function @xmath163 one can derive the occupation number operator of the @xmath102-th level as @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the projector on the @xmath102-th level eigenstate of the @xmath15-th boson . in @xcite the set of iom used in the construction of the gge is the free fermion analogue of these occupation number operators of the trap levels . therefore for the gge in the interacting case",
    ", it is natural to choose the set ( [ iom1 ] ) which is the generalisation of the free boson or fermion sets .    the interacting case @xmath100 is however different : due to the non - trivial commutation relations ( [ ccr ] ) , each time a swapping of two adjacent operators is needed in order to bring a term of ( [ 2 ] ) into the required alternating form , additional lower order terms appear that involve a sum over the exchange operator @xmath13 .",
    "for example , let us consider the term @xmath166 which needs only one swap of the 3rd and 4th operators in order to be brought into the right form .",
    "by doing so we get the extra term @xmath167 . moving the exchange operator to the left or right i.e. to the bra or ket ,",
    "on which its action gives simply 1 , we change the particle index of the intermediate string of operators from @xmath14 to @xmath15 and as a result the final expression is @xmath168 , instead of @xmath169 as it would be if there was no exchange operator . in general",
    "we now have , apart from all previous terms , also all possible products @xmath170 where @xmath87 is any partition of the integer @xmath171 , thus leading to ( [ taevo ] ) in the main text .",
    "the combinatorial coefficients @xmath85 and @xmath86 at leading order in @xmath1 for the first few moments are @xmath172 where @xmath173 .    in order to calculate the values of the iom @xmath75 in the initial state @xmath33 we could use the expansion ( [ psi ] ) of the latter in terms of the post - quench excitations on which the @xmath75 are diagonal .",
    "however the eigenvalues of @xmath75 on a general eigenstate are given only implicitly in the literature @xcite .",
    "an alternative route is instead to express the @xmath75 in terms of the pre - quench creation - annihilation operators using the inverse of the bogoliubov transformation ( [ bog ] ) , then normal - order the result using the pre - quench version of the ccr ( [ ccr ] ) and act on @xmath33 .",
    "we can omit all terms that would be impossible to contribute to the final expressions for the expectation values at _ leading order _ in @xmath1 .",
    "we observe that the leading order in @xmath1 contribution to the expectation values comes from all terms that when normal - ordered give the maximal power @xmath174 of the operator @xmath175 ( like e.g. the alternating term @xmath176 ) which in turn when acting on @xmath33 give simply @xmath177 .",
    "in other words , we find that @xmath178 for a suitable function @xmath179 . in the last equation",
    "the dots `` ... '' denote pre - quench excitations that are accompanied by coefficients of lower order in @xmath1 and do not contribute to the leading order expressions when we apply the state @xmath180 on the left . according to the above ,",
    "the leading order expectation values of the iom on the initial state are @xmath181    next we consider the products of iom . if we start with a product of two iom @xmath182 we can readily see that , always to leading order in @xmath1 @xmath183 i.e. in general , products of iom can be constructed by introduction of @xmath184 between @xmath185 operators",
    ". therefore their study too reduces to a direct application of the previous observation and we have @xmath186 which proves the factorisation of the iom in the initial state at leading order in @xmath1 .      as a verification of the consistency of our results ,",
    "we compare the gge values of the first four moments , as given by ( [ mom ] ) along with ( [ iom2 ] ) , with the actual time averaged values , as given by ( [ mom0 ] ) and ( [ bn ] ) from which we have @xmath188 the agreement between these two independently derived results is indeed exact ."

    "<S> , a measurement of @xmath103 _ only _ , would lead to the misconception that the system is described by a gibbs ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> this is not in contradiction with the gge conjecture , since the latter refers to local observables while the moments are global ones . in order to correctly predict the time </S>",
    "<S> averaged local density profile @xmath63 instead , we need all of its moments @xmath104 and therefore the _ full _ gge is required , i.e. including all infinite iom . </S>",
    "<S> notice that in ( [ rhogge ] ) we used only the @xmath1 lowest iom : including all higher ones as well would be equivalent to including all products of the @xmath1 lowest ones , since the higher are algebraically dependent on the lower ones . </S>",
    "<S> however , as discussed above , in the thermodynamic limit the products of iom do not need to be included in the gge , because their values in the initial state become uncorrelated and therefore are already predicted correctly by the gge ( [ rhogge ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> even though an experimental implementation of the hcm remains elusive so far , we expect that the general conclusions drawn above will serve as guidelines to experimentalists working on the verification of the gge conjecture , since the need of a confining trap ( that breaks the integrability of other models , like the lieb - liniger ) in experimental systems seems inevitable .    _ </S>",
