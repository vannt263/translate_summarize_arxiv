    "digitized time domain signals with a given instantaneous bandwidth are often analyzed at high spectral resolution using the fast fourier transform ( fft ) @xcite . as we show below , fitting fft - derived spectra with a model function",
    "can be challenging because of their non - gaussian statistical fluctuations , which depend on both the true signal and any sources of added noise .",
    "the exact properties of the fluctuations depend on the number of raw fft spectra accumulated prior to analyzing the spectrum .",
    "this study is particularly motivated by a unique observation of the record - breaking @xcite solar flare of 06 december 2006 by our fasr subsystem testbed ( fst * ? ? ?",
    "* ) instrument , which revealed a rich variety of narrowband coherent emissions , including dense clusters of narrowband radio spikes .",
    "solar radio spikes @xcite are a most intriguing type of solar coherent radio emission @xcite , and have attracted attention both observationally and theoretically because of their unique properties and potential diagnostic value @xcite .",
    "for example , the spectral bandwidth of spikes is typically 1% or less of the frequency at which they occur @xcite , which implies that some controlling parameter of the spike source can in principle be determined with a corresponding precision of 1% or better , which would be superior for remote diagnostics of the solar corona .",
    "this diagnostic potential can be realized , however , only if the spike emission mechanism is solidly established and the corresponding source model is well understood .",
    "although reports in the literature often favor the electron cyclotron maser ( ecm , e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ) emission mechanism @xcite , it is not yet clear whether all observed spikes are due to a single mechanism , or perhaps have multiple causes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the latter is supported by some observations , e.g. by observations of post - flare spikes @xcite originating from spatial locations lacking the relatively strong magnetic field required for ecm to operate .",
    "one way to test the hypothesis that different mechanisms are involved in different events is to examine the statistical properties of spikes in a uniform way from one event to another .",
    "irrespective of the coherent emission mechanism involved , the phenomenon of spike emission requires significant wave growth , driven by a kinetic instability in fast electrons .",
    "various regimes of such instability result in different statistical distributions of spike parameters such as amplitude , lifetime , or bandwidth .",
    "thus , getting a reliable distribution of these spike parameters from observations can shed light on both the production mechanism and on the fast electron distribution over energy and pitch - angle .",
    "in addition , spike parameter distributions contain information on global properties of the spike cluster source , such as its fragmentation into sources of individual spikes @xcite , and the level of magnetic irregularities ( turbulence ) in the source @xcite .    with the above motivations , we seek a uniform method to derive true spike parameters from spectral observations , which in the case of dense spike clusters requires reliable decomposition into individual spikes in the presence of statistical fluctuations that can masquerade as spikes .",
    "we emphasize that this is a nontrivial task given that the spike bandwidth can be comparable to the instrument spectral resolution , while the spike amplitude can be comparable to ( or less than ) the typical amplitude of statistical fluctuations .    typically , an fft - based instrument observes a sequence of @xmath0 time - domain samples , which are converted to @xmath1-channel raw spectra and then accumulated over @xmath2 such spectra to get a final output spectrum .",
    "this averaging reduces the amplitude of statistical fluctuations , but at the same time degrades the temporal or spectral resolutions .",
    "therefore , there is a trade - off in the number of channels @xmath1 and accumulations @xmath2 for a given application .",
    "fortunately , our fst observations offer a unique data set for studying the interplay between the spectral resolution and the level of statistical fluctuations , because the instrument directly records digitized time - domain samples obtained with 1  ns resolution .",
    "these are organized in 100  @xmath3s contiguous blocks , which are separated by 19.9  ms time - domain gaps needed to read out and store the previously acquired contiguous block @xcite .",
    "direct recording of time - domain data allows one to post - process each contiguous time - domain block with different fft settings ( different values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) , to obtain accumulated spectra with adjustable spectral resolution and accumulation length .",
    "in this study we take advantage of this flexibility to identify the optimal spectral resolution needed to perform spike decomposition and obtain reliable statistical distributions of spike parameters . to achieve this goal we developed a theory describing properties of the statistical fluctuations for @xmath2-accumulate raw fft spectra , tested it on simulated data , and created a software tool capable of automatically fitting the corresponding data .",
    "this tool has been employed in the analysis of fst data in order to get the amplitude and bandwidth distributions of the observed spikes , both of which turn out to be asymmetric distributions with prominent power - law tails toward high amplitudes or large bandwidths .",
    "the open source code of this tool has been made publicly available as part of the solarsoftware ( ssw-_http://www.lmsal.com / solarsoft/ _ ) scientific software repository , and is being located in the ssw distribution tree at _ ..",
    "\\radio\\ovsa\\idl\\fitting\\spike_explorer.pro_. in section  [ motivation ] we describe the general problem in using fft data to measure reliable parameters of the observed spikes .",
    "the basic approach is to add spectral - peak model components representing individual spikes until an overall minimum @xmath4 criterion is met .",
    "we find that a correct determination of @xmath4 requires a new theoretical treatment of the noise statistics for fft - derived spectra , which we provide in section  [ fftstat ] .",
    "to actually apply the theory to our problem requires not only estimating errors for a given model , but also determining whether and where to place additional model components .",
    "a novel approach based on statistical likelihood of the run - length of regions of mismatch between data and model is developed in section  [ composite ] . in section  [ algorithm ]",
    "we describe the model - fitting algorithm using simulated data .",
    "finally , the algorithm is applied to the 6 december 2006 event in section  [ data ] , and the results are discussed in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "to illustrate the problem we face in this study , consider the simulated spike cluster shown in figure  [ fitproblem ] .",
    "the problem is to construct a model that adequately fits the data , consisting of one or more overlapping spectral components , each of which we take here as being adequately described by a gaussian of adjustable amplitude and width .",
    "the justification for this choice will be given in section  [ algorithm ] , but the general algorithm is independent of the specific form of the model .",
    "the figure presents three standard least - squares solutions obtained from fitting an fft - derived spectrum with different spectral models assuming superpositions of a flat background and one , two , or three gaussian peaks , i.e. @xmath5 where @xmath6 or @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( that is , background level , amplitude , position and width ) , are the unknown free parameters corresponding to each component .",
    "it may appear that there are dozens of spikes in this cluster .",
    "however , because the mean and noise are related for fft - derived spectra , the noise is largest in channels where the intensity is greatest .",
    "a statistically - based algorithm designed for the specific case of fft - derived noise statistics is needed to assess whether a deviation of the model from the data can be explained by noise , or instead requires placement of an additional component .",
    "the next two sections use the specialized language and notation of statistics theory to formally derive the relevant relationships necessary to address the problem outlined above .",
    "readers interested only in the application and results can skip to section  [ data ] .",
    "statistics of the fft - derived spectra can be formulated in terms of the standard _ gamma _ probability distribution function ( pdf ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the euler s gamma function , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are , respectively , the shape and scale parameters of the distribution , which determine its mean , @xmath14 , variance , @xmath15 , skewness , @xmath16 , and kurtosis @xmath17 .",

    "another drawback of the maximum likelihood method is its tendency to converge toward a local extreme , rather than an absolute one .",
    "instead , we use a least - squares minimization for the purpose of making an initial guess of the unknown parameters",
    ". however , the weighting scheme adopted in equation  [ model_w ] is no good for this purpose , since the weights come from the model itself , which we do not initially know . to comply with the standard implementation of the least - squared minimization algorithm , which employs weighting coefficients @xmath49 derived from measurement errors , we employ the unbiased variance estimator @xmath77 derived in appendix [ sumvar ] to assign the sample - based weights @xmath78 based on the measured data samples",
    "this is equivalent to minimizing the quantity @xmath79 which pursues in a reciprocal space the same goal as the model - based weighing scheme , i.e. finding the model that globally minimizes the deviations of the same local smr parameters from unity .",
    "however , the uncertainties associated with the estimated parameters provided by the local curvature at the point of absolute @xmath4 minimum @xcite , @xmath80^{-1}\\ ] ] are different for the two weighting schemes , which affects the most likely solution obtained , as quantitatively illustrated in appendix [ comparison ] .",
    "minimization of estimator equation  ( [ chisqr2 ] ) is the more practical of the alternatives .",
    "consider the composite spectrum illustrated in figure [ twospikes ] , which consists of superposition of two partially overlapping gaussian peaks , same as in figure  [ fitproblem ] , shown by the red curves . in order to fit the simulated , noise - contaminated spectrum ( thin black line ) , calculated for an accumulation length @xmath81",

    "likelihoods @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath37 and @xmath58 minimizations lead to solutions that have goodness - of - fit and likelihoods comparable with the true model function , while the @xmath82 minimization leads to a solution with poorer goodness - of - fit and likelihood . however , it has the advantage of being closer to the true shape of one of the overlapping peaks , unlike the alternative solutions that provide estimates that are closer to the envelope of the overlapping peaks functional form gives , by design , more weight to the low amplitude data points , which are less affected by fft noise than the peaks , while the @xmath58 and @xmath37 functional forms favor global solutions that are more consistent with the entire data set under the assumption that the true spectral model contains only one spectral peak . ] . the same conclusion is supported by figure [ twospikes](b ) , which displays the local deviations @xmath55 and their averages over the entire spectrum @xmath83 . now , the poorer @xmath82 minimization signals the inadequacy of the model while the non - uniform pattern of the smr deviations indicates the most appropriate location to make a model adjustment . by adding a new spectral peak to the model close to the suggested location , the results displayed in figures [ twospikes](c ) and ( d ) are obtained .",
    "these panels reveal that in the case of a good model fit , @xmath58 and @xmath37 minimizations provide more accurate estimates of the true spectral peaks than the @xmath82 minimization , as indicated by their @xmath62 and @xmath83 estimators being closer to unity .",
    "this suggests a strategy where values from @xmath82 minimization are used to identify where new model components are needed , and @xmath58 and @xmath37 minimizations are used to assess the final model parameters once the model components are determined . in practice ,",
    "we find that @xmath37 minimization yields the best results .",
    "as has been shown , @xmath82-minimization is the most sensitive to a local data  model mismatch .",
    "the presence of local smr deviations greater than statistically expected can suggest the spectral location at which the spectral model should be amended ( by adding one more peak , for example ) . this offers a starting point for designing an adaptive , self - consistent spectral - fitting algorithm that should be capable of adding complexity to an initially crude spectral model until the remaining smr fluctuations around unity are solely due to statistical fluctuations , within an acceptable confidence interval .",
    "the probability to observe a local smr exceeding an observed value @xmath84 due to statistical fluctuations can be computed from equation  ( [ normpdf ] ) to yield @xmath85 consequently , the probabilities to observe a local smr deviation above or below the mean , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively , are given by @xmath88    to identify a strong deviation from the model , equation  ( [ normprob ] ) alone may be sufficient . in a more general case , however , especially for a smaller - amplitude but spectrally - resolved signal , we expect that the data will deviate from an imperfect model in some compact spectral region that will result in systematic deviations of the smr estimator either above or below unity .    to quantitatively address this aspect of the fitting problem , we derive the pdf describing the probability of observing a compact region of a given length whose smr deviates from unity solely as the result of statistical fluctuations",
    ". this will allow a decision on where and when a local improvement to the model function is needed , based on some desired probability of false alarms .",
    "we first derive the discrete probability mass functions ( pmf ) for observing a smr compact region of a certain size @xmath1 that is located above or below unity .",
    "the process of such compact regions of a given size occurring randomly can be described as a memoryless bernoulli process in which any individual smr in a random sequence may be above or below unity with the unequal probabilities @xmath89 and , respectively @xmath90 ( equation  [ pab ] ) .",
    "the two size distributions should obey complementary geometrical distributions given by @xmath91\\left[\\frac{\\gamma(m)}{\\gamma(m , m)}\\right]^{n_a}\\\\\\nonumber f(n_b)&=&\\frac{\\gamma(m)}{\\gamma(m , m)}\\left[1-\\frac{\\gamma(m)}{\\gamma(m , m)}\\right]^{n_b},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which represent the conditional probabilities of observing a run of smr deviations , all on the same side of unity , of length @xmath92 , terminated by any smr deviation of the opposite sense .",
    "we have confirmed this expectation with simulated fft - derived spectral data .",
    "in addition to the run - length criterion , we can examine the probability for an identified region to deviate in amplitude by more than statistically expected from the population mean of @xmath53 which we define as the mean of the @xmath1 contiguous individual smr deviations that are all above , or all below , unity ,    @xmath93,\\\\\\nonumber   \\eta_b=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{j = j_0}^{j_0+n-1}[\\widehat{\\rho_j}\\le1 ] .",

    "hence , @xmath94 where @xmath95 represents the heaviside unit step function .",
    "although the desired pdf can not be obtained in closed form , we can nevertheless compute its moments in a standard way , which we do in appendix [ appendix_moments ] .",

    ", we will also use in the subsequent derivations the alternative standard parameter @xmath102 .",
    "having determined the exact first four standard moments of the mean smr probability distribution functions , it may be shown ( see appendix [ appendix_p1vmc ] for a detailed quantitative analysis ) that the pearson type i pdf @xcite is a generally valid approximation , at least for large run - lengths @xmath103 , for the true pdf describing the parent populations of the @xmath97 and @xmath98 random variables .",
    "this is suggested by figure [ pearsonregions ] , which displays the relationship between the kurtosis @xmath104 and squared skewness ( @xmath105 ) as computed from equation  ( [ cma ] ) ( red @xmath106 symbols ) and equation  ( [ cmb ] ) ( blue @xmath106 symbols ) for @xmath107 and @xmath108 , and @xmath2 ranging from @xmath109 to @xmath110 .",

    "however , unless the length of a compact smr region is fairly large , @xmath103 , its parent pdf can not be accurately approximated by a purely gaussian distribution ( which corresponds to the point on the @xmath114-axis @xmath115 ) .    in its most general form ,",

    "our model choice ( superposition of positive - amplitude gaussians ) necessarily means that the algorithm described below flags only positive smr deviations to indicate where to add components .",
    "the theory above , however , does not make any assumption about the form of the model , and for some models ( e.g. superposition of wavelets , or spectra where both absorption and emission are expected ) it could be appropriate to flag both positive and negative smr deviations for adding components .",
    "the selection of positive gaussian spectral components is not arbitrary for the case of radio spike bursts . indeed , as has been said in the introduction , a coherent emission mechanism of the radio spikes implies the necessity of many e - folding amplifications of the radiation as it propagates through the source region of a given spike .",
    "it is apparent that the spike spectrum has a peak where the corresponding spatial growth rate @xmath139 has a maximum as a function of frequency @xcite . since for the required strong amplification , only a small vicinity of this maximum plays a role , the true frequency dependence of the growth rate",
    "can be reliably approximated by a parabolic one @xcite @xmath140 where @xmath141 and @xmath142 are constant parameters of this approximation .",
    "the intensity of the amplified waves is proportional to @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the spike source size along the line of sight ; thus , the parabolic dependence of the growth rate translates to the gaussian dependence of the wave energy density .",

    "a noise level corresponding to @xmath145 has been applied to match the typical accumulation length of the fst instrument @xcite and @xmath146 frequency channels have been chosen to provide an appropriate frequency scale visualizing the spectral details .",
    "the first step of the algorithm performs an initial guess of a minimal number of peaks present in the spectrum .",
    "the algorithm starts with a simple flat spectrum indicated by the blue horizontal line in figure [ fitsteps]a , which results in the parameters listed in blue on the right side of the plot .",
    "based on this initial model function , the local smr deviations are computed and displayed in figure [ fitsteps]b . at this stage , the smr sequence is divided into adjacent compact regions deviating below or above unity , and their mean smr deviations @xmath98 , or @xmath97 , are computed .",
    "the probabilities of observing these averaged smr deviations are computed according to eqn .",
    "[ betaprob ] and all smr regions above the adopted probability threshold are flagged .",
    "an initial guess of gaussian parameters are computed based on the number , location , width , and average amplitude in the region . for the particular example used for illustration ,",
    "figure [ fitsteps]b indicates three such regions delimited by solid green vertical lines .",
    "their averaged smr values are shown as blue horizontal segments , while the red solid segments indicate the maximum range of the deviations allowed by the pearson type i pdf approximations in each case .",
    "the two red horizontal lines spanning the entire frequency range indicate the standard @xmath133 pfa thresholds corresponding to an @xmath147 region .",
    "the set of these three gaussian peaks shown in figure [ fitsteps]c in solid green along with the flat background are then used as the initial guess of the true spectral shape .",
    "the next stage of the fitting algorithm involves a standard @xmath82 minimization that , in our example , results in the set of three gaussian peaks shown in figure [ fitsteps]c as blue solid lines . in this and",
    "all subsequent left - hand panels , the @xmath62 , @xmath37 , and @xmath83 parameters from the fit in that step are indicated in blue .",
    "note that for overlapping peaks the @xmath82 minimization finds a solution close to the low - amplitude spectral components .",
    "this built - in bias of the @xmath82 minimization , which results in the recomputed smr deviations shown in figure [ fitsteps]d , offers greater sensitivity for finding additional components as discussed earlier .",
    "now five regions ( vertical green lines ) are identified , where new spectral components should be added to the model function .    at this stage of the algorithm ,",
    "the flagged smr regions are sorted in order of their chance probability , equation  ( [ absolute ] ) , and the most improbable one , marked by solid vertical lines in our example , is chosen as the location at which an additional spectral peak is added to the model . panels @xmath148-@xmath149 display a sequence of identical steps that are repeated up to the point that , as seen in panel @xmath149 , no compact smr region deviates above the upper limit of the pearson type i pdf , and no individual smr deviation , whether isolated or part of a compact region , crosses the @xmath147 standard probability threshold .",
    "the last stage of the fitting algorithm consists of using the final solution of the @xmath82 minimization as a starting point for finding the absolute minimum of the negative log - likelihood function @xmath37 , which , as shown in figure  [ twospikes ] ( see also figure  [ one ] ) , should be situated in the neighborhood of the @xmath82 solution .",
    "the spectral shape solution provided by the @xmath37 minimization is displayed in figure  [ fitsteps]m and its corresponding smr deviations are displayed in figure [ fitsteps]n .",
    "one should note that the final @xmath37 minimization results not only , as expected , in a smaller value of @xmath37 , but also in a smaller value of the goodness - of - fit parameter @xmath62 ( which corresponds to the @xmath58 measure ) .",
    "although , in the case of the particular example illustrated in figure [ fitsteps ] , this final @xmath37 minimization stage of the algorithm results only in a minimal change in the final @xmath82 solution , this correction has the merit of having a proper goodness - of - fit estimate and also being fully consistent with a maximum likelihood criterion .",
    "each spectral model component has its own amplitude - dependent level of statistical fluctuations ; thus , the successful fitting algorithm must fit both the true signal ( deterministically ) and the associated fluctuations ( statistically ) . adding spectral components to an already well - determined model will reduce the fluctuations below the expected level , which offers an objective means for rejecting such an excessive model . to avoid adding an excessive spectral component , our fitting algorithm employs a gradual augmentation of the model function , which except for the starting point , adds only one spectral component at each step up to the point where no smr region exceeds the preset pfa thresholds .",
    "therefore , by design , the algorithm is not expected to continue adding spectral components above the minimally needed number .",
    "however , the @xmath82 minimization might not find a valid solution for a given set of initial guess parameters , or might settle on a local rather than a global minimum . to avoid this",
    ", we implemented a mechanism that checks the validity of solution and , in case of failure , allows an early termination of the process before all smr residuals are brought within the desired limits . for this purpose , after each new minimization , the goodness - of - fit @xmath62 is computed and the new solution is rejected if its goodness of fit is larger than the one of the previous solution . if this happens , while more than one smr region had been flagged at the previous step , the next in line is considered , and a new @xmath82 minimization is attempted based on the new set of initial parameters until the @xmath62 is successfully decreased or all the available flagged regions have been tried .",
    "if the attempt to add a new spectral component fails for all smr suggested locations , the @xmath82 minimization stage is abnormally exited , and the partial solution may be either rejected or flagged as possibly unreliable .      as noted earlier",
    ", the fst instrument directly records time - domain data for 100  @xmath3s ( @xmath150 samples ) at a time .",
    "these can be split into @xmath2 accumulations of @xmath44-channel spectra , with the constraint @xmath151 , allowing us to trade spectral resolution , 500/@xmath44 mhz , for a reduced level of statistical fluctuations , which depend on @xmath2 .",
    "this motivates us to consider the effect of this trade - off , using simulated data , on the algorithm s ability to recover the true model .",
    "figure [ tf_res ] illustrates the algorithm s performance in the case of a synthetic spectrum composed of the same underlying components as in figure [ fitsteps ] , but sampled with lower and higher spectral resolutions . to mimic the design of an fft - based spectrometer like fst , which digitizes the time domain signal at a fixed sampling rate , the changes in spectral resolution are accompanied by inversely proportional changes in the accumulation lengths @xmath2",
    "the spectrum shown in figure [ tf_res]a , c , although less affected by noise fluctuations due to its increased accumulation length , @xmath152 , is negatively impacted by the proportionately lower spectral resolution .",
    "it results in under - sampling the spectral shape , as quantified by the large @xmath153 . in these conditions , the algorithm , while succeeding in reducing the smr deviations , fails to properly resolve the overlapping spectral peaks , and underestimates the amplitudes of the isolated ones , even though the final @xmath154 suggests a rather successful fit . on the other hand ,",
    "the higher frequency resolution of the spectrum shown in figure  [ tf_res]e , g , which should facilitate the spectral separation of the overlapping peaks , is counterbalanced by the shorter accumulation length @xmath155 , which results in a higher level of statistical fluctuations .",
    "this level of fluctuations prevents the algorithm from resolving three closely overlapping peaks .",
    "however , the local systematic smr deviations revealed by figure [ tf_res]h , suggests the need for further model adjustment . to programmatically achieve this , the detection threshold would have to be decreased at the cost of a higher false - alarm rate .",
    "figure [ tf_res]i presents the last stage of the fitting process of the same spectrum as in figure [ tf_res]g , but with the choice of a tiny increase in the pfa threshold of @xmath156 .",
    "the algorithm now succeeds in lowering the local smr deviations and identifying the correct number of spectral peaks .",
    "we now apply the fitting algorithm to a 60-s data segment recorded by the fst instrument @xcite during the record - breaking solar flare of 06 december 2006 @xcite . during this exceptional solar flare , which lasted more than an hour",
    ", the radio data recorded by the fst instrument in the @xmath157ghz frequency range revealed a rich variety of spectral fine structures such as fiber , zebra , and spike bursts .",
    "the data that we analyze occurred at the decay phase of a much longer period of spike emission that was mainly responsible for the highest radio flux ( @xmath158  sfu ) ever recorded during a solar radio burst .",
    "the spikes became less numerous during this late decay phase , but nevertheless occurred in such high numbers that many overlapping spikes are seen , which the algorithm described above must handle .",
    "fst observes the sun interferometrically with three antennas .",
    "although both total power ( signals from each antenna separately ) and correlated data ( cross - correlations of amplitude and phase between each pair of antennas ) are available , the fft - based statistics we describe in this paper apply only to total power . as shown in figure  [ tp_compare ] , the total power records are essentially identical , which confirms that the fluctuations are dominated by the statistics of the solar signal and not by uncorrelated thermal fluctuations in each antenna .",
    "incidentally , it also places a constraint on the anisotropy in the spike emission on the scale of the spatial separation between the antennas ( baselines of 136 , 244 , and 280 meters ) : there is clear one - to - one correspondence between spikes recorded by the three different antennas in contrast to what has been reported by @xcite for two different instruments located in toru and ondejov and so separated by 450  km .",
    "figure [ fst]a displays a 3-second detail of the @xmath145 dynamic spectrum showing the spike emission . the vertical dotted line indicates the time of a representative fit solution shown in figure  [ fst]b .",
    "the @xmath62 goodness - of - fit parameter , and the average smr deviation @xmath83 are printed in the plot .",
    "figure [ fst]c displays the local smr deviations . all but two local smr deviations lie within the @xmath159 pfa thresholds shown by the horizontal lines , but the algorithm did not add spikes in these locations because doing so did not improve @xmath62 .",
    "we can check to what extent the model derived from the data is consistent with our expectation that the statistical noise is dependent solely on the amplitude of the signal . to do this ,",
    "we generate a synthetic dynamic spectrum by taking the superposition of gaussians found for each spectrum of real data and adding numerically generated statistical noise calculated for @xmath145 . the resulting synthetic spectrum for the 3-s period is shown in figure  [ fst]d , which can not be distinguished visually from figure  [ fst]a .",
    "we then run the algorithm on these synthetic data and examine the fit results and the residuals .",
    "for example , the fitting solution and corresponding smr deviations for the same time as in figure  [ fst]b , c are shown in figure  [ fst]e , f , respectively . although qualitatively similar to the real - data solution , the synthetic - data solution in figure  [ fst]e has only @xmath160 spikes and a better @xmath161 .",
    "the smr residuals in figure  [ fst]c appear to be about twice those of figure  [ fst]f .",
    "this quantitative mismatch between the data - based and simulation - based solution indicates that not all smr residuals in figure  [ fst]c are due to @xmath145 noise .",
    "this is further confirmed by figure  [ gof ] , which presents the distribution of @xmath62 for the 150 times in figure  [ fst]a , d and the distributions of the smr deviations corresponding to each spectral point of these times .",
    "the analysis is performed for three different accumulation lengths , @xmath67 ( left ) , @xmath145 ( middle ) , and @xmath162 ( right ) . here",
    "we include only those times for which the fitting algorithm succeeded to find a solution where all smr deviations are within their allowed range ( @xmath159 pfa ) .",
    "thus , for example , the fit in figure  [ fst]b is rejected .",
    "the @xmath62 distributions for the synthetic spectra in figure  [ gof]a - c cluster around unity , while those based on the original data are higher .",
    "this suggests that there is another source of fluctuations than those based on accumulation number @xmath2 , which becomes masked only when @xmath2 is small enough that @xmath2-based fluctuations dominate",
    ". these fluctuations could be due to unresolved spikes .",
    "the distributions of the individual smr deviations shown in the bottom row of figure [ gof ] complement the above conclusion by revealing that the smr distributions of both real ( solid yellow ) and synthetic ( blue ) data fits are not only closest to the theoretical distribution ( red curve ) in the @xmath67 , but also consistent to each other , i.e. they have similar excess values @xmath163 and @xmath164 , respectively , relative to the expected theoretical smr distribution given by equation ( [ normpdf ] ) .",
    "for the remainder of this section we continue to compare the results derived from actual data in yellow with those derived from model - based synthetic spectra in blue , as a means of highlighting potential limitations .",
    "figure [ real2sim ] compares the data - derived distributions ( solid yellow histograms ) of spike normalized amplitude ( upper row ) , location frequency ( middle row ) , and bandwidth ( bottom row ) , with the distributions derived from the corresponding synthetic spectra ( overlaid blue histograms ) .    the amplitude normalization factor has been chosen based on the average fst background in absence of any spike emission . for reference , the unit normalized amplitude , which therefore correspond to the average noise level ,",
    "is indicated on each of the upper panel plots by vertical red lines .",
    "the number of spikes extracted from real data , i.e. @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 , as well as the number and relative percentage of the extracted spikes from the synthetic spectra , i.e. @xmath168 , @xmath169 , and @xmath170 , are shown in the plots . the amplitude distributions display high - end power - laws , as well as a low - end rollover clearly associated with the background noise level .",
    "while the power - law slopes and intercepts of the real- and synthetic - data amplitude distributions are consistent in each case , it is evident that most of the missing spikes from the synthetic - data distributions come from below the noise level .",
    "we conclude that the distributions above unit normalized amplitude are reliable , and further , as we concluded from figure  [ gof ] , the @xmath67 spectra provide the best combination of statistical noise and frequency resolution",
    ". the spike extraction algorithm performance can be quantified by an overall @xmath171 real - spike validation rate , as well as by only a minor difference between the lower ends of the real and synthetic data distributions .",
    "the center - frequency distributions of the spikes , shown in the middle row of figure  [ real2sim ] , have a remarkably pure exponential distribution in the available spectral domain , 11.5  ghz .",
    "the shape of the distribution , however , suggests that there are spikes at @xmath172  ghz and many more at @xmath173  ghz .",
    "we can not know the overall frequency distribution including these unmeasured bands .",
    "the bandwidth distributions shown in bottom row of figure  [ real2sim ] show a bi - modal distribution , but the broader - band population centered around 1000  mhz exceeds the 500  mhz bandwidth of the observed spectrum .",
    "these large bandwidth structures are added by the fitting algorithm to compensate for smooth variations of the background , and are not actual spike emission .",
    "the lower - bandwidth distribution , from a few to about 100  mhz ( vertical red dotted line ) , show a clear power - law pattern with a roll - over below a few mhz .",
    "this appears to be a real attribute of the spike bandwidth distribution , since it is clearly located above the corresponding spectral resolution , i.e. 0.5 , 1 , and 2  mhz , indicated in each case by red vertical lines in figure  [ real2sim]c , f and i , respectively .    in order to further distinguish solar spikes from non - solar artifacts , we present in figure  [ freq2bw ] , for each of the three accumulation lengths , the two - dimensional distributions of spike location versus spike bandwidth . for clarity we plot in the top row the real - data spike distribution ( yellow ) on top of the synthetic - data distribution ( blue ) ,",
    "while in the bottom we invert the plotting order . the pair of solid red vertical lines represent the @xmath174 frequency range of the instrument , the pair of solid red horizontal lines represent a fixed @xmath175 bandwidth range , and the dotted red horizontal line indicates the frequency resolution corresponding to the accumulation length @xmath2 .",
    "there is a clear separation of fitted spikes into two families , one within the physically justifiable confines of the inner red box , and another well outside the region of interest .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the parameter - space boundaries drawn by the red solid lines , along with a minimum normalized - amplitude limit of unity , can be used as filtering criteria to reliably separate the true solar spikes from non - solar artifacts .    consequently , figure [ ampbw ] presents the results of fitting the power - law indexes of the filtered amplitude and bandwidth distributions .",
    "however , for illustration purposes , the distributions shown in this figure were only partially filtered as follows : to build the density distributions shown on the upper row , only the bandwidth and location frequency filters were applied , while the bandwidth distributions shown on the bottom row were obtained from data filtered only by the location frequency and amplitude criteria .",
    "in contrast to figure [ real2sim ] , the distributions shown in figure [ ampbw ] are the density distributions , i.e. the counts in each logarithmic bin have been divided by the corresponding variable bin width . on each plot ,",
    "the amplitude or bandwidth ranges used to perform the linear fits , which complete in each case the full filtering of data , are indicated by vertical red dotted lines .",
    "the resulting power - law indexes , and their fit uncertainties , are indicated in corresponding colors for the real ( yellow ) and synthetic ( blue ) distributions . on the bottom row plots ,",
    "the vertical red solid lines indicate the spectral resolution corresponding to each accumulation length @xmath2 .",
    "the results displayed in figure [ ampbw ] confirm quantitatively that the best agreement between the slopes of the real and synthetic distributions is reached in the case @xmath67 , the most favorable tradeoff between spectral resolution and the expected level of statistical noise fluctuations for the solar spikes observed in this event .",
    "as one final refinement , we noted earlier ( fig .  [ tf_res ] ) that the finding of spikes might be improved by lowering the spike detection thresholds from the @xmath176 level to a less conservative , but still close to zero , @xmath177 .",
    "we therefore repeat the fitting based on this detection threshold for @xmath67 and summarize the results in figure  [ selected_case ] . in figure",
    "[ selected_case]a we compare the goodness of fit estimators of the original - data fits , @xmath178 , with those from fitting the corresponding synthesized spectra , @xmath179 .",
    "changing the pfa level to a small , but a nonzero value resulted in more than doubling the number of spikes extracted from data , i.e. @xmath180 vs @xmath181 , while the percentage of self - consistently validated spikes increased slightly to @xmath182 from the @xmath183 figure indicated in figure[real2sim]a .",
    "we interpret this result as an indication that using a slightly less conservative pfa threshold allows extraction of significantly more spikes , and consequently a better spike model , without a significant increase in misidentification of statistical noise fluctuations as true solar spikes . to quantitatively support this assertion",
    ", we calculate that , when directly applied to the number of extracted spikes , @xmath180 , the particular value we chose for the probability for a given detected peak to be created by a statistical fluctuation , @xmath177 , indicates that the probability to have any one misidentified spike from the detected @xmath184 peaks is @xmath185 ; hence , from a statistical perspective , less than one additionally detected spike could have resulted from a false alarm flagging of the spectral model .",
    "we thus conclude that , for practical purposes , the criterion of keeping the absolute number of potentially false spikes below 1 may provide an objective means for adoption of a certain non - zero pfa suitable for the amount of data being investigated .",
    "the distribution of the local smr deviations shown in figure  [ selected_case]b , when compared with figure  [ gof]d , also indicates an improvement in algorithm s performance , which is quantized by a reduction of the distribution excess parameters from @xmath163 to @xmath186 for the real data fits , and from @xmath164 to @xmath187 for the synthesized data fits .",
    "similarly , the two - dimensional distributions of spike bandwidth versus spike location shown in figures  [ selected_case]c , d , confirm that the rectangular parameter space bounded by the limits of the observed frequency range ( vertical red solid lines ) , the spectral resolution ( horizontal red dashed line ) and the empirical high bandwidth limit of 100  mhz ( horizontal red solid line ) , clearly confines the bulk of the true solar spike population and provides a reliable means for filtering out the non - solar artifacts .",
    "the very good visual agreement of the spike normalized - amplitude and bandwidth distributions obtained from the original data ( solid yellow ) and synthesized data ( blue ) in figure  [ selected_case]e , f is quantitatively confirmed by their identical power law slopes , @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "the low - amplitude roll - over in figure  [ selected_case]e is well below the noise ( unit normalized amplitude ) limit , and hence the shape of the true distribution in this amplitude region is not well recovered , as seen from the mismatch between the yellow and blue distributions . in contrast , the low - bandwidth roll - over ( peaking around 3  mhz ) in figure  [ selected_case]f is well above the frequency resolution ( 0.5  mhz ) and is undoubtedly a real feature .",
    "the power - law tail of this distribution results in a mean bandwidth ( 7.5  mhz ) that is higher than the peak ( most probable ) bandwidth .",
    "the proposed spike decomposition algorithm allowed us to extract more than 7500 individual spikes from a relatively sparse fragment of the powerful spike cluster observed from the 06 dec 2006 flare ; the obtained number of spikes is sufficient for a detailed statistical analysis of spike properties .",
    "the fitted distributions of the spike bandwidth have a ( real ) primary peak at a few mhz and two secondary peaks that we have concluded are artifacts ",
    "one below 1  mhz and the other around 1000  mhz .",
    "the first of them originates from very narrowband ( unresolved ) fluctuations ( possibly including interference ) misidentified by the algorithm as true spikes while the second is due slight background variations .",
    "filtering these two artifacts results in sharp edges in the distribution that prevent us from straightforwardly finding the moments of the true spike bandwidth distribution .",
    "the reliable portion of the measured bandwidth distribution obeys a power - law with index around @xmath190 , mean of 7.5  mhz , and mode of about 3  mhz .",
    "similar asymmetric shapes of the bandwidth distribution are typical and have been reported for both decimeter and microwave spikes @xcite . @xcite",
    "employed a theory of the ecm bandwidth formation in a source with random inhomogeneities of the magnetic field developed by @xcite and demonstrated that the observed distribution was in almost perfect agreement with this theory .",
    "the comparison of the moments of the observed and modeled distributions yielded an estimate of the corresponding magnetic irregularities ( relatively small - scale turbulence ) to be @xmath191 . in our case , because of the aforementioned high - end and low - end artifacts , we can not confidently estimate the higher moments of the bandwidth distribution , which is needed to compute the magnetic irregularity level .",
    "we , nevertheless , can tell that a comparably low level of the magnetic irregularities would be sufficient to yield the observed distribution .",
    "although it may seem surprising that such a small value can in fact be measured through its effect on the spike spectrum shape , one must keep in mind that these small magnetic field variations have to be compared with another very small value  the ecm natural bandwidth , which is typically as small as @xmath192 @xcite .    the central frequency , @xmath193",
    ", distribution carries some information of the global parameter range at the source of the spike cluster , presumably , one ( or more ) coronal loops involved in the flaring process . the available spectral range , 11.5  ghz implies the magnetic field range of 357535  g if the ecm emission is produced at the fundamental of the gyrofrequency , or of 179268  g in case of the second harmonic .",
    "clearly , the actual range of the magnetic field is much broader because the central frequency distribution continues well outside our spectral window. the ability to produce either fundamental or harmonic ecm emission also constrains the plasma density , because the growth rates at these gyroharmonics have a strong dependence on the ` plasma parameter ' @xmath194 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , fundamental extraordinary - mode ecm emission requires @xmath195 ( @xmath196  @xmath197 ) , fundamental ordinary - mode ecm emission requires @xmath198 ( @xmath199  @xmath197 ) , and second harmonic extraordinary ecm emission requires @xmath200 ( @xmath201  @xmath197 ) .",
    "identification of the emission mode ( recall the spike emission is 100% polarized in this event ) through the spatially resolved measurements along with other context data can help to identify the emission mode and so improve the use of the spike properties as a probe of source parameters .",
    "the derived distribution of spike amplitude does not display any apparent artifact and so is more conclusive .",
    "indeed , in the meaningful range , roughly between 1 and 100 , the distribution is well fitted by a power - law with an index around @xmath202 , while it displays low- and high- amplitude rollovers outside this range .",
    "the low - amplitude rollover results from inability of the algorithm to fully recover the peaks having the amplitudes comparable or lower than the mean level of the signal .",
    "we emphasize that there must be plenty of the low - amplitude spike for a reason related to the fst recording mode .",
    "the fst time resolution is 20  ms ; however , the signal accumulation time is only 100  @xmath3s within the 20  ms time interval .",
    "we checked that the spike signal level does not change measurably during this 100  @xmath3s time interval implying that the typical spike duration is noticeably longer than 100  @xmath3s .",
    "on the other hand , we did not find clear cases when the same spike would be recorded over two consequent 20  ms intervals , implying that the spike duration is shorter than 20  ms ; note that according a phenomenologically established regression law , the typical spike duration at 1  ghz is only marginally less than @xmath203  ms ( see fig . 3 in",
    "this means that during one measurement the given spike comes and goes , so the 100  @xmath3s snapshot can correspond to any point of the rise , peak , or decay phase .",
    "even if all the spikes were to have the same peak amplitude , the described measurements would result in a broad distribution of the observed amplitude whose exact shape depends on the exact shape of the spike light curve ; for example , for an exponential growth and a similar exponential decay this will be a power - law distribution with index @xmath204 .",
    "the observed index , @xmath202 , deviates from @xmath204 and so implies some statistical distribution of spike peak amplitudes .",
    "it is , thus , difficult to determine a true amplitude distribution from our data given that we do not know the exact shape of the spike light curve .",
    "in fact , the amplitude ( or , alternatively , spike power ) distributions have been analyzed for a number of events observed with different instruments @xcite because various theories of the spike generation predict distinctly different amlitude / power distributions ; specifically , the power - law , log - normal , and exponential distributions have been proposed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the power - law distribution obtained here appears to be in a remarkable agreement with expectation for an avalanche process in which exponential growth of the unstable waves responsible for the spike generation is terminated at high but random level , ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and , specifically , their curve b in figure  4 ) . in our case , the role of this termination of random wave growth is played by the snapshot measurement made at a random phase of the spike light curve",
    ". stated another way , the snapshot observation mode must necessarily result in a power - law distribution of the observed amplitudes .",
    "the fact , that such a power - law distribution is actually observed , can , thus , be interpreted as a successful consistency test of our spike decomposition algorithm .    although some characteristics of the fst instrument ( relatively narrow @xmath205  ghz frequency range and the low duty - cycle , snap - shot sampling ) limit our use of the spike statistics for probing the corona , its other unique characteristic  directly sampling the time - domain data  has allowed us to investigate the performance of our statistically - based fitting algorithm for a range of realizations of the same spike data .",
    "the algorithm is found to be robust and should be directly applicable to data taken with other fft - based radio instruments such as the jansky very large array and the expanded owens valley solar array .",
    "in addition , the theory and fitting algorithm built based on it have a much broader applicability range than fitting of solar radio spikes , as it applies to any spectrum obtained via fft of time - domain signals .",
    "although finding an exact closed form for the pdf of the random variable @xmath206 may be a difficult , if not impossible , mathematical task , the less challenging task of finding a approximation sufficient for practical applications may be straightforwardly accomplished by evaluating the expectation @xmath207 and the higher statistical moments of the goodness of fit parameter , i.e. @xmath208 .    for this purpose , we write @xmath209 where @xmath210 is a random variable that , being linearly related to @xmath55 , follows a re - scaled and translated @xmath211 pdf , i.e. @xmath212    from this perspective , @xmath206 represents the sample mean of the squared random variable @xmath213 , which allows us to use the pdf of @xmath214 for computing the expected variance of @xmath206 from a simple formula that relates it to the expectations of @xmath215 and @xmath213 @xcite , @xmath216=\\frac{2}{n}\\left(1+\\frac{3}{m}\\right).\\ ] ] this shows that , for a fixed @xmath44 , the variance of the goodness of fit estimator asymptotically decreases as the accumulation length @xmath2 increases , from a maximum value of @xmath217 toward @xmath218 , which is the variance of a standard @xmath206 pdf .",
