    "students may wonder as to what happens if a non - overlapping well ( at negative energies ) is adjacent to a finite barrier ( at negative energies ) ( see figs .  1 ) . perhaps for the want of an application this system has gone undiscussed , however , interesting queries do arise for this kind of potentials",
    ". one may wonder as to whether the well ( at negative energies ) can change ( increase / decrease ) the transmitivity of the barrier ( at positive energies ) quantitatively and significantly .",
    "one may like to know whether there can be qualitative changes in the transmitivity of the barrier @xmath0 due to the presence of the well in some class of cases .    in this article we would like to show that a well near a barrier can change the transmitivity of the barrier both quantitatively and qualitatively .",
    "in fact a scattering potential well ( vanishing at @xmath4 ) can give rise to a non - overlapping well adjacent to a finite barrier ( nwafb ) as @xmath5 where @xmath6 see figs .",
    "however in this case , a change in the depth of the well or its distance from the barrier would also change the height of the barrier .",
    "consequently , the effect of the well on the transmission property of the original barrier can not come up explicitly .",
    "we , therefore , consider wells of zero - range or finite range .",
    "else , if they are scattering wells of infinite range on one side they ought to be joined to the barrier continuously or dis - continuously . in the following",
    "we discuss the various possibilities for nwabf .",
    "we construct various models of nwafb using three parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 . here",

    "it may be mentioned that the finite range potential like @xmath34 would rather be a nwafb of type ( 3 ) with @xmath35 than of the type ( 4 ) .",
    "next we have to solve the schrdinger equation @xmath36 for finding the transmitivity , @xmath2 , of the various potential models discussed above . when the potentials are real and hermitian the time reversal symmetry ensures that the transmitivity and reflectivity are independent of the direction of incidence of particle whether it is from left or right .",
    "due to this symmetry , in transmission through nwafb it does not matter whether the incident particle sees the well or the barrier first .",

    "this simple and exactly solvable model of nwafb suggests that a well near a barrier neither increases nor decreases the transmitivity of the barrier .",

    "increase in the frequency of these oscillations due to increase in @xmath8 ( perturbation moving away ) is paradoxical .",

    "as rk - integration is step by step method wherein the calculated value of the function , @xmath82 , and its slope ( momentum ) @xmath83 at one step serve as initial values for the next step .",
    "this suits quantal calculations wherein the wavefunction and its derivative must match everywhere in the domain of the potential .",
    "importantly , then it does not matter whether or not the potential is continuous or has a finite jump discontinuity at one or more number of points in the domain of the potential .",
    "we finally write the solution of eq .",
    "( 6 ) as @xmath84 in case of @xmath72 ( 4 ) and @xmath73 ( 5 ) , the distances @xmath85 and @xmath86 will be replaced by @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively .",

    "using the eq .  ( 16 ) , we calculate the transmitivity of various analytically intractable models given in section iii .",
    "let us discuss the nwafb represented by @xmath71 in eq .",

    "the form of the barrier is fixed as @xmath95 and its parameter @xmath21 this gives @xmath96 as about 5 units . in figs .",
    "3(a ) , we see only marginal excursions in @xmath2 when the well is shallow , wide and distant . when the well is deeper but juxtaposed to the barrier ( @xmath35 ) the frequency of oscillations decreases ( see figs .",
    "when the well is away from the barrier , @xmath2 is more oscillatory compare figs .",
    "3(b ) with figs .",
    "when the depth of the well is increased to 10 units ( @xmath97 ) the amplitude of the oscillations increases ( see figs .",
    "3(d ) ) . in nwabf",
    "the essence is that the oscillations in @xmath2 are seen riding around @xmath1 . in other words",
    "the well induces oscillations in the transmitivity of the adjacent barrier .",
    "we would like to remark that a piecewise constant potential mentioned in ref.@xcite ( see eq .   ( 22 ) there ) can now be seen as a nwafb of the type ( 3 ) , wherein both the well and the barrier are square ( rectangular ) and @xmath2 is oscillatory ( see fig .  5 there ) .",
    "next we study parabolic well in @xmath71 ( 3 ) . in figs .",
    "4(a ) , this time we find that the well - depth has to be comparable to the barrier height of 5 units for changing @xmath2 appreciably when compared to @xmath1 .",
    "the effect of increase in the depth of the well can be seen to enhance the amplitude of of oscillations in @xmath2 by comparing figs .",
    "4(a ) with figs .",
    "@xmath2 in figs .",
    "4(b ) is less oscillatory as compared to that in figs .",
    "4(c ) because the well and barrier are juxtaposed to each other with @xmath35 .",
    "so in this model too the energy oscillations occurring in @xmath2 are due to increase in the width or depth of the well or its distance from the barrier",
    ". however , these oscillations are less prominent than those of rectangular potential model seen in figs .",
    "the general feature of the nwabf of the type @xmath71 ( 3 ) that the transmitivity is more oscillatory when a thinner barrier is away from the well is well demonstrated when one compares figs .",
    "4(c ) and figs .",
    ".    the oscillations in the transmitivity of rectangular and parabolic models of nwafb ( 3 ) may be attributed @xcite to their finite range ( finite support ) and also to the distance @xmath8 over which the potential being zero allows the interference of plane waves .",
    "further , the prominence of oscillations in @xmath2 of rectangular model lies in the fact that rectangular potential well or barriers are most localized profiles between two points than any other profile of finite support@xcite .",
    "5 , displays the qualitatively similar oscillatory transmitivity when quite thin wells ( @xmath98 ) are used in nwafb of the type given by @xmath71 in eq .",
    "the depths of the wells and their distances from the barrier are fixed as @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively .",
    "these wells taken here are rectangular , parabolic , gaussian , and triangular ( see the line below eq .",
    "( 3 ) ) . from this fig .  5",
    "we conclude that quite thin wells despite being away from the barrier can induce prominent oscillations in @xmath2 provided they are sufficiently deep .",
    "if not so deep the amplitude of oscillations will be small .",
    "now we study two more modifications of nwafb which are made up of scattering potentials of infinite range",
    ". these are @xmath72 ( 4 ) and @xmath73 ( 5 ) . in the case of @xmath72 ( see solid curve in figs .  1(c ) ) when the well and the barrier are juxtaposed continuously at @xmath65 , we find ( see figs .",
    "6(a ) ) that if the well is strong it reduces the transmitivity and then increases it only marginally at energies below the barrier . at energies above the barrier height the changes are inappreciable . in the dis - continuous case",
    "( see dashed curve in figs .",
    "1(c ) ) , we find that the hidden well reduces @xmath2 over all ( below and above the barrier ) energies ( see figs",
    ".  6(b ) ) .",
    "this is the characteristic feature of the potential being discontinuous at a point ( @xmath65 ) as the well and the barrier are juxtaposed there in a discontinuous way as in the case of a simple potential step@xcite .",
    "also the well reduces transmitivity of the barrier in an appreciable way only if it is strong ( e.g. , @xmath101 ) .",
    "we have confirmed absence of energy oscillations in these two models by varying @xmath9 and @xmath10 high and low abundantly .",
    "moreover , in this regard the exact analytic expression @xcite @xmath2 of the scarf ii potential ( @xmath102 ) readily testifies to a non - oscillatory behaviour of nwafb of the type ( 4 ) as a function of energy @xmath103},\\ ] ] with @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "however , in the above models @xmath72 ( 4 ) and @xmath73 ( 5 ) if the well and barrier are separated by a distance , @xmath8 , the transmitivity will again acquire oscillations .",
    "we would like to emphasize that it is the separation between the well and the barrier that plays a crucial role in causing energy - excursions ( oscillations ) in @xmath2 with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "6(c , d ) demonstrate that in case of single piece nwafb ( 1 ) when @xmath108 and @xmath109 it requires a very deep well @xmath110 to get even small excursions in @xmath2 with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "appreciable energy oscillations can be seen in @xmath2 only if the well is much deeper ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "this feature is surprising in view of the fact that the nwafb of the types ( eqs .",
    "( 2,3 ) ) in figs .",
    "2 - 5 have displayed good energy oscillations even if @xmath9 is twice of @xmath10 or even less than @xmath10 .",
    "in all the results presented in figs .  2 - 6 ( see the dotted curve ) , in nwabf the general trend of @xmath2 is determined by the barrier is irrespective of the strength of the well .",
    "broadly , three ( eqs .",
    "( 1 - 3 ) ) types of nwafb ( see figs .",
    "1 ) entailing single well and a single barrier are possible . however , one has choices of the profiles for the well and the barrier in them .",
    "apart from the results of various profiles presented here in figs .",
    "( 2 - 6 ) we have also studied several other profiles and explored various parametric regimes in all three types of nwabf to confirm our findings presented here .",
    "the transmission through a barrier is the phenomenon of positive energy continuum , we conclude that the well ( at negative energies ) essentially causes energy - excursions ( ripples or oscillations ) in the transmitivity of the barrier .",
    "howsoever strong the well is the trend of transmitivity as a function of energy is determined only by the barrier .",
    "ordinarily , the finite support(range ) of the well may also be attributed@xcite to cause energy oscillations in the transmitivity . in this regard ,",
    "the energy - oscillations in the transmitivity of one - piece smooth potential ( 1 ) of infinite range found here are unexpected .",
    "however , it has required the well depth to be extremely large ( see figs .",
    "the separation between the well and the barrier is _ sufficient _ if not the _ necessary _ condition in giving rise to oscillations in transmitivity .",
    "when the well and the barrier are separated away , the potential in the intermediate region is zero .",
    "this gives a scope for destructive and constructive interference of plane waves and hence the frequency of energy - oscillations in the transmitivity increases .",
    "however , if one views the well as a perturbation to the barrier then the enhanced oscillations in @xmath2 despite the well being distant is paradoxical .",
    "the infinite range well and barrier if joined at a point with no separation ( @xmath35 ) between them do not seem to have energy - oscillations in transmitivity until they are separated .",
    "the energy - oscillations in transmitivity at energy below the barrier suggests a novelty because usually transmitivity is found@xcite to be oscillatory at energies above the barrier .",
    "the transmitivity of various potential systems which converge asymptotiacally @xmath112 to zero or to a constant value and which are either continuous or entail finite jump discontinuities can be found using eq .",
    "( 16 ) presented here . in this article",

    "<S> when the well and barrier are joined continuously , @xmath2 increases and then decreases at energies below the barrier . at energy above the the barrier the changes are inappreciable . in these two cases </S>",
    "<S> if we separate the well and the barrier by a distance , @xmath2 again acquires oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> paradoxically , it turns out that a distant well induces more energy oscillations in @xmath2 than when it is near the barrier . </S>"
