    "significant progress has been made in the discovery of new superheavy nuclei in the last decade @xcite .",
    "superheavy elements at the extreme end of the periodic table have been synthesized in the laboratory .",
    "the synthesis of superheavy nuclei with @xmath8 at gsi , darmstadt @xcite and jinr , dubna @xcite has stimulated the interest in the properties of superheavy nuclei .",
    "discovery of isotopes of @xmath9 and @xmath10 was reported in jinr , dubna and synthesis of @xmath11 at berkeley was reported some time ago @xcite .",
    "earlier superheavy nuclei could be unambiguously identified by their @xmath5-decay chains leading to already known nuclei .",
    "however , the decay chains of the newly found superheavy nuclei can not be linked to any nuclei known due to their relatively extreme positions in the periodic table .",
    "therefore , their identification depends much upon a comparison with theoretical models .",
    "much progress has also been made in theoretical investigations of the properties of superheavy nuclei .",
    "theoretical models such as macroscopic - microscopic ( mm ) models have been employed to discern and predict properties of superheavy nuclei . at the same time , various mean - field approaches have also been employed to investigate basic properties in this domain .",
    "the prediction of @xmath12114 was confirmed by mm models such as frdm with folded yukawa single - particle potential @xcite . for the next doubly - magic nucleus ,",
    "the available self - consistent models predict this to the more proton rich @xmath13120 or the even heavier one at @xmath14126 .",
    "predictions in various models tend to diverge primarily due differences in the form of the single - particle potentials .",
    "possibly different extrapolations arise in self - consistent relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) theory . here , the spin - orbit coupling is naturally built - in as a consequence of the dirac - lorentz structure of nucleons , whereas in all non - rmf models , it has to be introduced by hand .",
    "the non - rmf models tend to overestimate spin - orbit splitting with increase in mass number , thus affecting actual predictions of shell closures in the superheavy region .",
    "superheavy nuclei with inherently large density of single - particle states can be a sensitive probe for models of nuclear structure .",
    "various microscopic approaches such as non - relativistic density - dependent skyrme hartree - fock ( shf ) theory @xcite and that of mm type @xcite are used extensively to investigate the properties and structure of superheavy nuclei . in the mm approach , a sum of smooth energy based upon liquid - drop type formula on which shell correction is imposed using the method of strutinsky is obtained as the total binding energy of nuclei .",
    "the finite - range droplet model ( frdm ) has achieved a significant success amongst the mm models .",
    "the mass formula frdm is used to calculate the shell correction energies in order to identify the major magic numbers in the region of superheavy nuclei .",
    "a major proton magic number @xmath10 and a neutron magic number @xmath6 have been predicted by the frdm .",
    "the mm approach has also been performed by sobiczewski group @xcite , where the strutinsky shell correction @xcite is used for the microscopic component , whereas yukawa + exponential model is used for the macroscopic part .",
    "superheavy nuclei have also been studied extensively within the self - consistent mean - field models of skyrme hartree - fock ( shf ) type .",
    "comparative studies of shf and rmf models have been made .",
    "one of the first studies @xcite performed within rmf theory earlier on was using the force nl - sh @xcite .",
    "it was shown that neutron number @xmath6 appears to be magic for lighter superheavy nuclei whereas its importance is reduced for heavier superheavies with @xmath15 .",
    "there was also an indication of a small deformed shell - closure at @xmath10 for the proton number . in comparison ,",
    "the frdm predicted a strong shell gap at @xmath10 in the deformed region .",
    "extensive shell correction calculations were performed by kruppa et al .",
    "@xcite for sets of the skyrme and rmf forces in order to identify the magic numbers in the region of superheavy elements theoretically .",
    "the skyrme models predict the strongest shell effects for @xmath6 and @xmath16 124 , 126 and not at @xmath10 , whereas rmf theory did not show a clear shell gap at @xmath6 especially for heavier she .",
    "this was attributed to the difference in the shell structure in the above two approaches .",
    "this may have been due to a different isospin dependence in the skyrme model as compared to the rmf theory @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "all the skyrme forces have predicted a broad valley of shell stabilization around @xmath1 and @xmath17 172 and 184 .",
    "on the other hand , cwiok _ et al .",
    "@xcite have suggested a shift in the island of stability towards @xmath14126 .    in spite of an impressive agreement with experimental data for the heaviest elements , the theoretical uncertainities are large when extrapolating to unknown regions of the nuclear chart .",
    "in particular , there is no consensus among theories with regard to the regions of the shell stability for superheavy nuclei . since in these nuclei",
    "the single - particle level density is relatively large , small shifts in the position of single - particle levels ( e.g.,due to the coulomb or spin - orbit interaction ) can be crucial for determining the shell stability of a nucleus . while most macroscopic - microscopic ( non - self - consistent ) models predict @xmath10 to be magic , most self - consistent calculations suggest that the center of the proton shell stability should be moved up to higher proton numbers , i.e. , @xmath18 , or @xmath19 . for neutrons",
    "most non - relativistic calculations predict magic gap at @xmath6 while the relativistic mean - field theory yields @xmath7 - due to a slightly different spin - orbit interaction @xcite .",
    "the experimental determination of superheavy nuclei from this region will thus be very important for pinning down the fundamental question of the spin - orbit force .",
    "a number of theoretical studies have been carried out within the framework of the rmf theory @xcite to investigate properties of superheavy nuclei , in particular , @xmath5-decay properties . in ref .",
    "@xcite the nature of possible magic numbers within the framework of spherical relativistic hartree - bogoliubov theory using various interactions has been studied . a recent theoretical work @xcite sheds some light on the question of magic superheavy nuclei . according to the calculations ,",
    "the patterns of single - particle levels are significantly modified in superheavy elements .",
    "firstly , the overall level density grows with mass number a , as @xmath5 @xmath20 .",
    "secondly , no pronounced and uniquely preferred energy gaps appear in the spectrum .",
    "this shows that shell closures which are to be associated with large gaps in the spectrum are not robust in superheavy nuclei .",
    "the theory predicts that beyond @xmath21 and @xmath22 the usual localization of shell effects at magic numbers is diminished .",
    "instead , theory predicts fairly wide areas of large shell stabilization without magic gaps .    the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) theory @xcite has proved to be successful as a framework for description of various facets of nuclear properties . in the rmf theory , the nuclear force is produced by a virtual exchange of various mesons .",
    "the nuclear saturation is achieved by a balance between an attractive @xmath23- and a repulsive @xmath3-field .",
    "the relativistic lorentz covariance of the theory allows an intrinsic spin - orbit interaction based upon exchange of @xmath23- and @xmath3-mesons .",
    "this has been shown to be advantageous for properties which depend upon spin - orbit potential .",
    "an immediate advantage of the proper spin - orbit potential has been the success of the rmf theory to be able to describe the anomalous kink in the isotope shifts of pb nuclei @xcite .",
    "the isotopic shifts of pb have been measured with a high precision using atomic beam laser spectroscopy and are known to show a pronounced kink about the magic number @xmath22 .",
    "the non - relativistic approaches based upon the skyrme and gogny forces have , on the other hand , been unable to reproduce this kink .",
    "it was shown that this difference in the predictions of the skyrme model and the rmf theory is due to the isospin dependence of the spin - orbit term @xcite .",
    "the isospin dependence in the rmf theory is provided mainly by the coupling constant @xmath24 of the @xmath25-meson . however , as the strength of the spin - orbit term derives from a large sum of the absolute values of the scalar and vector fields , the contribution of @xmath25-field is much weaker in comparison .",
    "consequently , the isospin dependence of the spin - orbit potential in the rmf theory is relatively weak @xcite . with the success of the rmf theory in properties of nuclei related to the shell effects ,",
    "we have carried out a study of the superheavy nuclei with an rmf lagrangian model which has been shown to have improved shell effects in nuclei .    in the present work , we have explored the region of superheavy nuclei within the framework of the relativistic mean - field theory using the lagrangian model with the vector self - coupling of the @xmath3 meson .",
    "the region encompasses the superheavy elements from @xmath0 up to @xmath1 .",
    "nuclides in these isotopic chains with neutron number spanning @xmath26 to @xmath27 have been considered .",
    "we have used the force nl - sv1 due to sharma et al .",
    "@xcite with the vector self - coupling of the @xmath3 meson .",
    "our focus is primarily to look for possible signatures of neutron shell gaps or magic numbers in the region of superheavy nuclei .",
    "in the present work , we have employed the rmf theory to study properties of superheavy nuclei .",
    "the starting point of the rmf theory is the model due to walecka @xcite , which describes the nucleons as dirac spinors interacting by the exchange of several mesons : scalar mesons ( @xmath23 ) couple to the nucleons ( @xmath28 ) through a yukawa term @xmath29 and produce strong attraction , isoscalar vector mesons ( @xmath3 ) couple to the conserved nucleon current @xmath30 and cause almost as strong a repulsion .",
    "in addition , there are isovector @xmath25 mesons which couple to the isovector current and photons to produce the well - known electromagnetic interaction .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the hartree treatment , where the @xmath31 independent nucleons with the single - particle spinors @xmath32 ( i= 1, .. ,a ) form a slater determinant and move independently in the meson fields .",
    "the rmf theory starts with the standard lagrangian density    @xmath33    where the summation convention is used and the sum over @xmath34 runs over all nucleons .",
    "isovector quantities are indicated by the arrow bars .",
    "as proposed by boguta and bodmer @xcite , the @xmath23 meson moves in a nonlinear potential of the form : @xmath35 here , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the nucleon , the @xmath23- , the @xmath3- , and the @xmath25- meson masses , respectively .",
    "@xmath40 , @xmath41,@xmath42,and @xmath43/4@xmath44=1/137 are the coupling constants for the @xmath23-,the @xmath3-,the @xmath25-mesons and for the photon .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath45 represents the vector self - coupling of @xmath3-meson as introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the classical variation principle provides the klein - gordon equations for the mesons : @xmath46 whereby the sources are determined by the corresponding density and current distributions in the static nucleus .",
    "variation for the nucleonic field gives the dirac equation for nucleons : @xmath47 the effective mass @xmath48(r ) is determined by the scalar field @xmath23(r ) as @xmath49 and the potential vector potential @xmath50 is obtained as : @xmath51 bold faced letters indicate vectors in the 3-dimensional space .",
    "these fields are the solutions of the inhomogeneous klein - gordon equations .",
    "as is the case in the majority of applications , the contributions of antiparticles are neglected , i.e. , the _ no - sea _ approximation is employed .",
    "equation ( [ eqn:2.3 ] ) together with eq .",
    "( [ eqn:2.4 ] ) provides a closed set of equations . in order to describe the ground - state properties of nuclei",
    ", static solutions are obtained from the equations of motion eqs .",
    "( [ eqn:2.3]-[eqn:2.4 ] ) . in this case , the nucleon spinors are the eigenvectors of the stationary dirac equation , which yields the single - particle energies @xmath52 as eigenvalues .",
    "the solution of these equations is obtained iteratively . using these solutions ,",
    "one calculates physical quantities such as the total energy , charge radii and quadrupole moments amomg others .      for nuclei in the superheavy region exhibit significant deformations , we have employed the rmf theory for axially deformed configuration of nuclei .",
    "we solve the dirac equation ( [ eqn:2.3 ] ) as well as the klein - gordon equations ( [ eqn:2.4 ] ) by expansion of the wavefunctions into a complete set of eigen solutions of an harmonic oscillator potential @xcite . in the axially symmetric case the spinors @xmath53 and @xmath54",
    "are expanded in terms of the eigenfunctions of a deformed axially symmetric oscillator potential @xmath55 taking volume conservation into account , the two oscillator frequencies @xmath56 and @xmath57 can be expressed in terms of a deformation parameter @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 @xmath60 the corresponding oscillator length parameters are given by @xmath61 the volume conservation gives @xmath62 .",
    "the basis is now determined by the two constants @xmath63 and @xmath58 , which are chosen optimally .",
    "the deformation parameter of the oscillator basis @xmath58 is chosen to be identical for the dirac spinors and the meson fields .",
    "the deformation parameter @xmath64 is obtained from the calculated quadrupole moments for protons and neutrons through @xmath65 with @xmath66 ( fm ) .",
    "the quadrupole moments are calculated by using the expression : @xmath67      shell effects play an important role in identifying and consequently synthesizing superheavy elements due to additional stability provided by the shell effects .",
    "hence few comments on shell effects would be in order .",
    "the shell effects manifest strongly in nuclei with the existence of magic numbers .",
    "the origin of shell closure has long been understood due to spin - orbit coupling and to an ensuing splitting of levels .",
    "the spin - orbit potential and a bunching of levels create shell closures ( magic numbers ) which are predicted correctly by most of the models . in the non - relativistic density - dependent theory of the skyrme type , the spin - orbit interaction is added phenomenologically and its strength is adjusted to reproduce the spin - orbit splitting in @xmath68o . in the rmf theory , on the other hand , the spin - orbit interaction arises naturally due to exchange of @xmath23 and @xmath3 mesons between the nucleons .",
    "the strength of the interaction is determined by the spin - orbit splitting in @xmath68o and other nuclei , which is uniquely decided by the effective mass .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the shell effects in the rmf theory have been advantageous in a few aspects such as isotope shifts in nuclei . in view of this , application of the rmf theory to superheavy nuclei may have more realistic predictions .      in this work ,",
    "we have employed the lagrangian model with the quartic coupling of @xmath3 meson .",
    "the non - linear vector self - coupling of @xmath3-meson was introduced by bodmer @xcite and properties of nuclear matter were discussed on adding a quartic term in @xmath3-meson potential .",
    "the inclusion of the vector self - coupling of @xmath3 meson in addition to the non - linear scalar self - coupling of @xmath23 meson was found to have the effect of softening the high - density equation of state ( eos ) of the nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the force nl - sv1 @xcite with the inclusion of the vector self - coupling of @xmath3 meson was developed with a view to improve the predictions of the ground - state properties of nuclei , such as binding energies , charge radii and isotopes shifts of nuclei along the stability line .",
    "it was shown that with the lagrangian model nl - sv1 , the shell gaps in nuclei along the stability line such as ni and sn isotopic chains were improved as compared to lagrangian model with the nonlinear scalar coupling alone @xcite . with the improved shell structure along the line of @xmath69-stability with nl - sv1",
    ", it is expected that it shall have improved predictions in the region far away from the stability line . in view of this",
    ", we have used the parameter set nl - sv1 with the vector self - coupling of @xmath3 meson in our investigations .",
    "the parameters of the parameter set nl - sv1 @xcite are given in table i.    0.7 cm    .[table:]the lagrangian parameters of the force nl - sv1 @xcite used in the rmf calculations . [ cols=\"<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the input parameters required to carry out explicit numerical calculations are : neutron pairing gap @xmath70 , the proton pairing gap @xmath71 and the number of oscillator shells n@xmath72 and n@xmath73 of the fermionic wavefunctions and meson fields , respectively . both the fermionic and bosonic wavefunctions have been expanded in a basis of 20 harmonic oscillator shells in this work .",
    "we have carried out a study of superheavy nuclei from no ( @xmath0 ) to @xmath1 .",
    "the neutron number ranges from @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "this region encompasses the neutron number @xmath6 which has been predicted to be a magic number in various theories .",
    "a possible deformed shell has also been predicted in this region as discussed in section i. we have carried out deformed rmf+bcs calculations for superheavy nuclei in the above region . for pairing gaps , we have used the formula due to mller and nix @xcite as given by : @xmath74 @xmath75 an axially symmetric deformed configuration with reflection symmetry has been assumed for nuclei . for each nucleus an initial basis deformation of prolate as well as oblate type has been taken in order to seek a minimum both in the prolate as well as in the oblate region of the deformation space . consequently , we have obtained a prolate and an oblate minimum for most of the nuclei . however , nuclei close to a potential magic number assume a spherical shape .",
    "the rmf+bcs minimizations with nl - sv1 give rise to a prolate and an oblate solution for most of the nuclei .",
    "we show the quadrupole deformation @xmath64 for the lowest energy state ( ground state ) for all the isotopic chains in figures  [ fig : fig1](a)-  [ fig : fig1](j ) .",
    "a large number of nuclei in these chains assume a prolate shape in the ground state .",
    "this is especially the case in the region of neutron number @xmath76 .",
    "typically , these nuclei exhibit a prolate deformation of @xmath77 .    for the isotopic chains of no @xmath78 , rf @xmath79 and sg @xmath80",
    ", there is a transition from a prolate shape to an oblate shape at @xmath81 . beyond @xmath7 ,",
    "nuclei assume an oblate shape in the ground state for these isotopic chains ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a)@xmath82  [ fig : fig1](d ) ) .",
    "the magnitude of the oblate deformation decreases as the neutron number increases above @xmath7 , which approaches a vanishing value as the neutron number @xmath6 arrives . in the vicinity of @xmath6 ,",
    "nuclei exhibit a spherical shape .",
    "such a feature has been commonly predicted by several relativistic as well as non - relativistic theories , whereby @xmath6 constitutes a major magic number in the region of superheavy nuclei .",

    "the results with frdm are shown for comparison.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    as one goes to the heavier elements above sg @xmath80 , one can visualize that the tendency of prolate shapes in the range of neutron numbers @xmath84 continues for heavier superheavy elements as well .",
    "the point of shape transition from prolate to oblate seems to be shifting to a higher neutron number .",
    "for instance , for hs ( @xmath85 ) the prolate to oblate transition occurs at @xmath86 . for the isotopic chain ds ( @xmath87 )",
    "the shape transition point advances to @xmath88 .",
    "however , for @xmath9 and above , the transition point falls back to @xmath86 and below it .",
    "for instance , for @xmath89 and @xmath90 , the shape transition occurs at @xmath91 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "similarly , the shape transition point for @xmath1 falls back to @xmath92 .",
    "thus , the number of nuclei which exhibit an oblate shape below the neutron number @xmath6 increases steadily in going from @xmath9 to @xmath1 .",
    "as far as the spherical shape for @xmath6 nuclei is concerned , it is exhibited by all the isotopic chains from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "this is reminiscent of a magic shell character for the neutron number @xmath93 .    the general feature of shape transition from prolate to oblate in the region of @xmath94 prevails for all the isotopic chains considered in this study .",
    "we have made a comparison of nl - sv1 deformations with those predicted by the macroscopic - microscopic mass formula frdm .",
    "for the isotopic chains @xmath95 , the frdm exhibits a predominantly prolate shape for the neutron numbers @xmath84 .",
    "this feature is very similar to that predicted by nl - sv1 .",
    "the frdm shows a shape transition from prolate to an oblate shape at the neutron number @xmath96 for the chains @xmath97 .",
    "there is only a single nuclide exhibiting an oblate shape in frdm at @xmath96 for these chains , beyond which all the nuclei assume a spherical shape for the isotopic chains of @xmath95 in the frdm predictions , in contrast to nl - sv1 .",
    "the oblate deformation for @xmath86 nuclei in this region amounts to @xmath98 in the frdm .",
    "this is unlike nl - sv1 , where a significant number of nuclei exhibit a moderately deformed oblate shape until the supposedly magic number @xmath6 arrived at .    for the isotopic chains @xmath99 , the behaviour of frdm for deformation properties is rather uneven . for the region of the lower neutron numbers ,",
    "some nuclei in these chains show a moderately prolate shape , whereas a few others exhibit a small prolate deformation .",
    "this is followed by a shape transition to an oblate deformation at @xmath7 , followed by a spherical shape in going to higher neutron numbers .",
    "that nuclei in the vicinity of @xmath6 are predominantly spherical in frdm points to the hypothesis that @xmath6 maintains its magicity even for heavier superheavy elements in frdm .",
    "the mass formula extended thomas - fermi with strutinsky integral ( etf - si ) @xcite was obtained to fit experimental masses of more than 1600 nuclei from all over the periodic table .",
