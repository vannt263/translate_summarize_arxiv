    "there is a long history for the fascination in particles bound on curved surfaces , which dates back to the early days of quantum mechanics@xcite .",
    "there are two complimentary points of interests : one is how the particle motions are affected by the local curvature of the surface . the other is how the global topology ( i.e. , how the surface is wound ) affects quantum mechanical wave functions .",
    "the latter problem becomes especially interesting if we consider a _",
    "periodic _ surface embedded in the three - dimensional space .    geometrically ,",
    "schwarz , back in the 19th century , showed that we can make curved surfaces extend over the entire three - dimensional space by connecting hyperbolic ( i.e. , everywhere negatively curved ) patches .",
    "specifically , schwarz has constructed _ periodic minimal surfaces _",
    ", where minimal means that the negatively - curved surface has a minimized area with the mean curvature ( @xmath0 with @xmath1 being the principal curvatures ) vanishing everywhere on the surface.@xcite    there are reasons from both mathematics and condensed - matter physics why periodic surfaces are intriguing .",
    "first of all , periodic surfaces are of general interest in the condensed - matter physics .",
    "( i ) in general , `` crystals '' ( periodic structures ) composed of surfaces are conceptually interesting as a class of periodic system on which electrons move .",
    "mackay@xcite has classified them group - theoretically ( just as the ordinary crystals composed of atoms are classified with the space group ) , which he named ` flexi - crystallography ' .",
    "\\(ii ) in terms of materials science , periodic minimal surfaces represent the topology of real condensed - matter systems .",
    "these include not only conventional materials such as zeolites or a silica polymorph called melanophlogite@xcite , or isostructural silicon clathrates@xcite , but recent advances in fabrication of exotic materials such as fullerenes or nanotubes have inspired further possibilities such as negative - curvature fullerene ( or c@xmath2 zeolite)@xcite whose fabrication has been attempted with a zeolite as a template@xcite .",
    "their structures can be modeled as curved surfaces if we smear out atoms into a surface in the effective - mass sense , and it is a fundamental question to consider how a mobile ( e.g. , @xmath3 ) electron behaves on such surfaces    second , there are mathematical interests and simplifications when a periodic surface is minimal : we can exploit the weierstrass representation , which enables us to specify the surface in a surprisingly simple manner in terms of  navels \" .",
    "the representation also simplifies schrdinger s equation as we shall show in the present paper .",
    "there are further mathematical fascinations specific to surfaces .",
    "one virtue of the structure constructed from surfaces is we can deform it .",
    "one can in fact deform one minimal surface into another with a differential geometrical transformation called the bonnet transformation .",
    "we can then raise a question of how the band structure for one surface could be related with that for the transformed one .",
    "another interest is that some periodic minimal surfaces , such as schwarz s p - surface@xcite , have a high symmetry ( ` interior - exterior ' symmetry ) that divides the space into two equivalent parts , which should be reflected in the electronic band structure .",
    "so in the present paper we address ourselves a question : how the electronic band structures should look like for periodic minimal surfaces .",
    "to start with , however , we have to envisage there are in general two ways ( fig.[fig : schematic ] ) to make electrons confined to a surface : ( a ) one is to consider electrons bound to a thin , curved slab of thickness @xmath4 , where the limit @xmath5 is taken@xcite .",
    "( b ) the other is to consider the surface with the degree of freedom normal to the surface ignored from the outset , i.e. , a two - dimensional sheet is rolled into the curved surface@xcite .",
    "either way it has been shown that an effective potential arises from the curvature of the surface , but that the potential is different between the two cases .",
    "namely , the thin slab case ( a)@xcite has a potential @xmath6 while the case ( b)@xcite has @xmath7 the origin of the discrepancy was subsequently revealed by nagaoka and coworkers:@xcite when the degree of freedom normal to the surface is ignored , dirac s prescription for constrained systems can be applied , but there is a room for ambiguity in the order of operators .",
    "if we adopt the conservation constraint , the resultant equation reduces to that in the @xmath5 approach . when the surface is minimal ( @xmath8 ) , the curvature potential is nonzero in general ( since @xmath9 ) in case ( a ) , while the curvature potential vanishes identically in ( b ) .    for condensed - matter systems such as atoms arrayed along a curved surface",
    ", we should take the @xmath5 approach .",
    "still , the difference in the band structure between the two cases is curious .",
    "namely , although we have a periodic system in either case , the periodicity imposed in case ( a ) is the periodicity in the strong potential that confines the electron into a thin slab ( fig.1(a ) ) , while in the case ( b ) the electron moves freely along the surface , where the only constraint is that an electron has to move in a space having a nontrivial topology .",
    "the topology can have a profound effect on the electron s wave function , since , if we regard the periodic surface as a network of pipes ( a cubic network for p - surface , diamond for d - surface , etc ) , the wavefunction interferes with itself along various paths wound around the  necks \" .",
    "thus the periodicity felt by an electron amounts to the strong confining potential in case ( a ) , while the periodicity only enters as a way in which the wave function interferes in case ( b ) , and it is an intriguing question whether or not their band structures are similar .",
    "the purpose of this paper is , ( i ) to explicitly write down schrdinger s equation for electrons on periodic minimal surfaces by exploiting weierstrass s representation in order to obtain the electronic band structure ; ( ii ) to calculate and compare the band structures in cases ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "unexpectedly the band structures turns out to be similar between cases ( a ) and ( b ) , i.e. , the bands are primarily determined from the topological way in which the wave function interferes with itself .",
    "the energy scale of the band structure ( band splitting , such as a split of the ` d ' band into e@xmath10 and t@xmath11 , and band widths ) is also universally @xmath12 with @xmath13 being the linear dimension of the unit cell of the periodic surface .",
    "( iii ) we go further to ` martensitic - deform ' a surface to another connected by the bonnet transformation .",
    "we shall show that there exists a curious one - to - one correspondence in their band structures , which illustrates another curious feature in the topological band structure .",
    "we start with a mathematical prerequisite for representing minimal surfaces . a two - dimensional surface @xmath14 embedded in a three - dimensional space",
    "can be expressed in terms of two dimensional coordinates @xmath15 , where @xmath16 are called isothermal when the metric tensor @xmath17 is diagonal with @xmath18 what weierstrass and enneper have found is that a necessary and sufficient condition for @xmath19 representing a minimal surface with isothermal @xmath20 ( @xmath21 : a simply connected region ) is that there exist @xmath22 , functions of @xmath23 , with which @xmath24 is expressed as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a constant , and @xmath27 is assumed to be regular ( i.e. , @xmath28-th poles of @xmath29 assumed to coincide with @xmath30-th zeros of @xmath31).@xcite if there are singularities that violate this condition , we can exclude these points by incising cut(s ) to make @xmath21 a riemann surface .",
    "thus there is a one - to - one correspondence between a minimal surface and the functional form of @xmath32 .",
    "now , schrdinger s equation for a curved surface , expressed with two dimensional coordinates @xmath33 and metric tensor @xmath17 , is written * * ? ? ?",
    "* * as @xmath34 \\psi(q^1 , q^2 ) \\nonumber = \\\\",
    "e\\ \\psi(q^1 , q^2 ) ,        \\label{eqn : schresult2 }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where summations over repeated indices are assumed .",
    "this equation is for model ( a ) , while we can replace the second term in the bracket ( potential term ) by @xmath35 for model ( b ) .    in the weierstrass - enneper representation ,",
    "every quantity in the schrdinger s equation can be expressed in terms of @xmath31 and @xmath29 , since the laplacian , the first term in the angular brackets in eq.[eqn : schresult2 ] , reduces to @xmath36 in the isothermal coordinates , where @xmath37 ^ 4 , \\ ] ] while we can plug in @xmath38 for the curvature term .",
    "equation for periodic minimal surfaces then reduces to @xmath39 \\psi = \\varepsilon \\ \\psi,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 . as evident from the weierstrass representation ( [ eqn : weiermap ] ) , @xmath31 has the dimension of length and @xmath29 is dimensionless .",
    "hence the energies in minimal surfaces always scale as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 linear dimension of the unit cell ( a precise expression given in eqn.[eqn : wep ] below ) .",
    "we can have a more transparent form when @xmath43 ( as is often the case with periodic minimal surfaces , including p - surface ) . in this case",
    "we can exploit the stereographic map ( gauss map ) from the infinite complex plane @xmath44 to a unit sphere @xmath45 , @xmath46 after a bit of algebra , we finally arrive at the differential equation for @xmath45 , @xmath47    curiously , a common coefficient @xmath48 factors out for the laplacian ( the first three terms in the large parentheses in the above equation ) and the curvature potential ( + 1 ) , which is made manifest due to the weierstrass representation .",
    "hence the kinetic and potential energies vary in a correlated manner as we go from one minimal surface to another by changing @xmath31 .",
    "however , this does not imply that the curvature potential always exerts as large an effect as the kinetic energy does , since the expectation values of the kinetic and potential energies depend on the amplitude of the wave function , and a quantitative study is required .",
    "so we first take schwarz s p - surface as a typical triply - periodic ( periodic in @xmath49 ) minimal surface , or a ` simple cubic ' minimal surface ( belonging to a space group im3 m in the language of the flexi - crystallography ) .",
    "some authors@xcite gave the weierstrass - enneper representation for the p - surface as @xmath50 where @xmath51 linear dimension of the unit cell ( to be precise the unit cell size is @xmath52 , which is given as an elliptic integral ) .",
    "a unit cell of the p - surface comprises eight identical patches , as shown in fig.[fig : surfaceunit ] . with the stereographic mapping discussed above",
    ", a unit cell is mapped onto two spheres , connected into a riemann surface via four cuts , which have to be introduced to make @xmath27 non - singular since @xmath31 has poles .",
    "differential geometrically @xmath31 is in general specified solely by such poles in a form @xmath53 where @xmath54 determines the topology of the surface .",
    "in fact the poles correspond , in the language of differential geometry , to the _ navels _ ( umbilical points ) , which are defined as the points where every cross section is inflected , with the two principal curvatures becoming degenerate , @xmath55 ( @xmath56 for a minimal surface ) .",
    "so a periodic minimal surface is completely characterized by the navels that appear periodically .",
    "the curvature potential @xmath57 in case ( a ) varies on the surface , which may be called a ` crystal field ' in flexi - crystals .",
    "navels then specify the positions where the curvature potential becomes maxima ( @xmath56 ) , while the minima occurs at the maxima of the absolute value of @xmath58 for a minimal surface ) . in the p - surface",
    "the navels ( potential maxima ) occur at eight ` affensattel ' ( monkeys - saddle ) points in a unit cell@xcite , while the potential minima occur at four points around each nape of the neck as depicted in fig.[fig : surfaceunit](a).@xcite",
    "_ band structure for case ( a ) _ in schrdinger s equation for periodic minimal surfaces , eqn.([eqn : schonp ] ) , the variables @xmath59 can not be separated , so that we have solved the equation numerically by discretizing @xmath60 to diagonalize the hamiltonian matrix . in discretizing the spherical coordinates ,",
    "a special care is taken around the navels , since the jacobian @xmath61 of the transformation to the gauss sphere is singular there ( fig.[fig : pointp ] ) .",
    "the band structure is obtained by connecting the adjacent unit cells with appropriate phase factors .",
    "we now come to the result for the band structure for the p - surface in fig.[fig : bandp ] ( curves ) , and typical wavefunctions at @xmath62 and h in the bcc brillouin zone ( @xmath62 in the simple - cubic zone ) in fig.[fig : wavep ] .",
    "the p - surface happens to divide the space into two equivalent parts , since a body center enclosed by the surrounding unit cells has the same shape as the original unit , so that we first note that the true symmetry is body - centered cubic rather than simple cubic .",
    "so the bands are displayed on the brillouin zone for bcc . in accord with the above argument",
    ", the energy scale ( band width , splitting etc ) is @xmath12 .",
    "this is of the order of @xmath63 ev for @xmath64  , the unit cell size assumed for a hypothetical negative - curvature fullerene@xcite .",
    "the curvature , or the effective mass , of these bands are either positive ( electron - like ) or negative ( hole - like ) according to the nature of the wave function .",
    "the mass can not be estimated with a simple @xmath65 perturbation , since the perturbation @xmath66 derives from the fact that @xmath67 while @xmath68 has no such simple form on a curved surface .",
    "in other words , the @xmath65 formula has @xmath69 , so we would have to calculate the matrix elements of @xmath70 for wavefunctions that are finite only along the surface .    _ band structure for case ( b ) _ now we are in position to compare the ( a ) confinement case ( curves in fig.[fig : bandp ] ) with the ( b ) rolled case ( dotted lines in fig.[fig : bandp ] ) .",
    "we can immediately see that the two band structures are rather similar up to some offset @xmath71 .",
    "this is surprising , since there is no apriori reason why they should be . to be more precise quantitative features characterizing the band ,",
    "i.e. , the effective mass and band widths , are similar between the two cases .",
    "so we conclude that the band structure does not essentially depend on the way in which electrons are confined , at least for ` gently ' curved surfaces such as minimal surfaces where the there are no sharp edges that would give large curvature potentials .",
    "the next important question is : are the band structures for surfaces connected by the bonnet transformation related ?    _ bonnet transformation _ the deformation of the p - surface to other periodic minimal surfaces can be implemented by the bonnet transformation , which is conformal and is represented by an elliptic transformation .",
    "a beautiful asset of the weierstrass representation for minimal surfaces is that the bonnet transformation is simply represented by a phase factor , @xmath72 , in eqn.([eqn : weiermap ] ) , where @xmath73 is called the bonnet angle .",
    "if we apply this to the p - surface ( cubic ) , the transformation changes@xcite it into the g - surface ( gyroid with @xmath74 ) and the d - surface ( diamond with @xmath75 ) , which may be regarded as a ` martensitic transformation ' in the words of ref.@xcite .",
    "the structure of the d - surface is depicted , along with the p - surface , in fig.[fig : surfaceunit ] .",
    "since the d - surface has a diamond symmetry , its unit cell contains two ` cages ' .",
    "we can first note that the bonnet transformation preserves the metric tensor and the gaussian curvature .",
    "this implies that all the surfaces connected by the bonnet transformation obey the _ identical _ schrdinger equation within a unit patch .",
    "indeed , if we look at schrdinger s eqn.([eqn : schonp ] ) , @xmath31 only enters as @xmath76 , so that @xmath77 does not alter the equation .",
    "although this is curious enough , this does not mean that the band structures are identical , since , while the transformed surfaces share the same genus ( @xmath78 three for p and d ) , the way in which unit cells are connected is different among them .",
    "_ band structure of a bonnet - transformed surface _    figure [ fig : bandp_d ] compares the band structures for the p- and d - surfaces .",
    "the two band structures are indeed different due to the difference in three dimensional connection of the unit cells discussed above . curiously , however , we find that the values of the band energy at _ special points _",
    "( brillouin zone corners , edges and face - centers ) have identical set of values between different surfaces .",
    "namely , a close comparison of the two band structures reveals that the band energies exactly coincide , where the ` law of correspondence ' is    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + between the simple - cubic and bcc unit cells .",
    "the wave functions shown in figs.[fig : wavep_d ] , are actually related through this relation . a simplest way to confirm",
    "this is to note that the wave function on each unit patch behaves in a similar manner .",
    "in fact , the wave function @xmath79 in eqn.[eqn : schonp ] is identical between the two surfaces .",
    "the band structures revealed here should have important implications on various physical properties .",
    "these should include transport properties as well as the cyclotron resonance , which can detect the effective mass arising from topological band structures .",
    "since the mass is determined by the interference of wave functions , effects of external magnetic fields should also be interesting .",
    "we can finally comment that , if we adopt foams of graphite to realize curved surfaces@xcite , then the equation of motion of @xmath3 electrons on the network of the honeycomb lattice will become , in the effective mass picture , the problem of zero - mass dirac equation ( i.e. , weyl s equation ) on curved surfaces .",
    "while we have ignored spin degrees of freedom here , the spin connection on the surface will give rise to a berry s geometrical phase .",
    "if we mimic such structures with an assembly of atoms , the potential maxima around the neck correspond to the positions of eight - membered rings ( introduced to make the curvature negative ) on the ` graphite foam'.@xcite      if we mimic such structures with a graphite foam ( i.e. , a membrane of mostly hexagonal lattice ) , the potential minima correspond to the positions of eight - membered rings ( introduced to make the curvature negative ) @xcite .",
    "hyde and s. andersson , z. kristall . * 174 * , 225 ( 1986 ) .",
    "however , we can not actually change the bonnet angle continuously , since the surface does not close and intersects with itself for the angles between these values ."
