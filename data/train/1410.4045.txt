    "in the spirit of the construction of a field from its projective plane , boris zilber proposed an ambitious program : in model theory , the notion of algebraic closure in suitable first order structures gives rise to combinatorial geometries .",
    "these geometries can be very similar to projective spaces .",
    "zilber conjectured that a strongly minimal structure interprets an infinite group , or even an infinite field , as soon as it fulfills some conditions , conditions that are clearly necessary @xcite .",
    "this conjecture turned out to be false in general .",
    "however , together with ehud hrushovski they were able to establish that the conjecture holds for what they called `` zariski structures '' , first order structures with a topology which mimics the zariski topology @xcite .",
    "yaacov peterzil and sergei starchenko proved a variant of the conjecture for the class of o - minimal structures @xcite .",
    "o - minimal structures are linearly ordered structures , thus endowed with the topology defined by the ordering , and they present strong analogies with strongly minimal structures .",
    "it is then natural to ask the question for @xmath0-minimal structures .",
    "the @xmath0-minimality condition is an equivalent of strong minimality in the setting of ultrametric structures ( or more generally @xmath0-structures ) just as o - minimality is an equivalent of strong minimality in the setting of ordered structures .",
    "however , the steinitz exchange property which is a consequence of strong minimality and o - minimality , does not hold for all @xmath0-minimal structures .",
    "if we assume it , we are in the setting of _ geometric structures _ as defined by ehud hrushovski and anand pillay @xcite , since @xmath0-minimal structures do eliminate the quantifier @xmath1 , the other required property .",
    "geometric structures offer a common framework for strongly minimal or o - minimal structures as well as for many classical mathematical structures and provide tuned tools and techniques .",
    "the second author had constructed an infinite definable group in any geometric @xmath0-minimal structure , which is non - trivial and locally modular ( @xcite and @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we remove the assumption of local modularity .",
    "new arguments have to be blown into the proof and we follow the spirit of @xcite .",
    "some extra conditions are assumed , that appear in @xcite and in the context of fields in @xcite .",
    "they in particular guarantee the existence of limits of unary functions in the neighborhood of a point .",
    "this allows us to copy an essential element of @xcite : the notion of `` tangent '' . for a definable curve @xmath2 and a definable family @xmath3 of curves , where @xmath2 and all the curves of @xmath3 pass through some fixed point @xmath4 ,",
    "the idea is to determine a curve in @xmath3 which , on a neighborhood of @xmath4 , is closer to @xmath2 than any other element of @xmath3 .",
    "more precisely we show the following .",
    "* theorem : * _ let @xmath5 be a @xmath0-minimal structure which is definably maximal , geometric and non - trivial .",
    "suppose moreover that in the underlying tree of @xmath5 there is no definable bijection between a bounded interval and an unbounded one .",
    "then there is an infinite group definable in @xmath5 . _",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is devoted to preliminaries on @xmath0-minimal structures . in section [ snicefamilies ]",
    ", we show that either an infinite group or a family @xmath6 of functions with _ nice properties _ is definable in @xmath5 .",
    "the idea is then to get a group law by composing the elements of this family of functions .",
    "as the composition is in general not in @xmath6 , we have to _ approximate _ it with a function from @xmath6 . for this end",
    ", we introduce in sections [ stangents ] and [ sderivatives ] the notions of _ tangents _ and _ derivatives _ , and study their properties .",
    "we use them in section [ sgrouplaw ] to construct an infinite group in @xmath5 .",
    "we start with a few definitions and preliminary results . @xmath0-structures and @xmath0-minimal structures",
    "have been introduced and studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we remind in what follows their definition and principal properties .       * _ notations : _ * we use @xmath7 to denote structures and @xmath8 for their underlying sets .       in this paper ,",
    "a @xmath0-structure is a structure @xmath9 , where @xmath0 is a ternary predicate satisfying the following axioms :    * @xmath10 * @xmath11 * @xmath12 $ ] * @xmath13 .",

    "a set is said to be a _ ball _ if it is an open ball or a closed ball .",
    "it follows from the first three axioms of @xmath0-relations that the cones of @xmath15 form a basis of a completely disconnected topology on @xmath15 .",
    "the last axiom guarantees that all cones are infinite .",
    "let @xmath21 be a partially ordered set .",
    "we say that @xmath21 is a _ tree _ if the set of elements of @xmath22 less than any fixed element is totally ordered by @xmath23 , and if any two elements of @xmath22 have a greatest lower bound .",

    "it is easy to check that if @xmath17 and @xmath18 are two branches of @xmath22 , then @xmath24 exists . on the set of branches of @xmath22",
    ", we define a ternary relation @xmath0 in the following way : we say that @xmath25 is true if and only if @xmath26 .",
    "it is easy to check that this relation on the set of branches satisfies the first three axioms of a @xmath0-relation .",
    "a theorem from @xcite says that @xmath0-structures can be looked at as sets of branches of a tree , equipped with the @xmath0-relation as defined above .",
    "the construction of the _ underlying tree _ @xmath27 of a @xmath0-structure @xmath5 has been slightly modified in @xcite . in this new construction , @xmath15 can be identified with the set of leaves of @xmath27 .",
    "the tree @xmath28 appears as the quotient of @xmath29 by an adequate equivalence relation which is definable in @xmath30 . to an element @xmath31",
    ", we associate the branch @xmath32 . to elements @xmath33 ,",
    "we associate the node @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are seen as branches of @xmath27 .",
