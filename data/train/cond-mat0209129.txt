    "in paper ii of this series , we obtained the hamiltonian @xmath1 of a population of interacting cracks which is the energy necessary to lead a mesovolume of a disordered - solid system from uncracked and unstrained initial conditions , to a final crack state @xmath2 at a maximum imposed strain @xmath3 that is possibly different than the actual strain @xmath4 if the system has been subsequently unloaded . using this hamiltonian",
    ", we prove here that at a well - defined strain @xmath5 , the system undergoes a phase transition to bands of coherently oriented cracks .    to study the nature of this localization transition , we must evaluate the partition function @xmath6 from which all physical properties depending on the crack distribution are obtained through differentiation . in paper",
    "i , it was established that @xmath6 takes a standard form @xmath7 despite the fact that it derives from the initial quenched disorder in the grain - contact strengths and has nothing to do with fluctuations through time .",
    "the possible crack states @xmath2 for a mesovolume are defined by a local order parameter @xmath8 distributed at each cell @xmath9 of a regular square network of identical cells .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath8 corresponds to the length of a local crack ( always less than cell dimensions ) , and its sign indicates its orientation ( @xmath10 relative to the principle - stress axis ) .",
    "our approach for performing the sum over states begins by determining which fields @xmath11 maximize the hamiltonian . because the temperature in strain - controlled experiments is negative , such maximizing states are the dominant terms in eq .",
    "any change in the nature of the maximizing crack - fields or in the nature of the hamiltonian in their neighborhood ( _ e.g. _ , the vanishing of a second derivative ) corresponds to a phase transition .    in sec .",
    "ii , the localization transition is identified and the geometrical nature of the crack fields in the `` functional neighborhood '' surrounding the maximizing states defined . in sec .",
    "iii , we sum only over this subset of all states to obtain an analytical approximation of @xmath6 . in sec .",
    "iv , the free energy @xmath12 is differentiated with respect to @xmath13 and @xmath14 to determine both the sustained stress @xmath15 , the energy @xmath16 , and the entropy @xmath17 . in the approach to localization ,",
    "no singularities are present in either @xmath18 or any of its derivatives with respect to strain or temperature which demonstrates , among other things , that the stress / strain relation is analytic up to ( and including ) localization . in sec .",
    "v , an external field @xmath19 is introduced that couples to @xmath20 permitting an autocorrelation function to be obtained .",
    "all singularities at localization are in the second ( and higher ) derivatives of @xmath21 with respect to @xmath19 with the consequence that the correlation length diverges as @xmath0 .",
    "we now determine the most probable states by maximizing the hamiltonian @xmath1 along the load path @xmath22 . from the summary of paper ii , we have @xmath23+e^{\\text { int}}(\\ep_{m})[\\varphi ]   \\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the energy of the intact material , @xmath25 is the energy due to the crack field when crack interactions are neglected , and @xmath26 is the energy due to crack interactions .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 derives from the quenched - disorder distribution and is bounded as @xmath28 .",
    "that the hamiltonian must be maximized and not minimized comes from the temperature parameter being negative as was quantitatively established in sec .",
    "iv of paper i. because we assume the system is intact before strain is applied , it is a fact of our model that the intact state is always the most probable .",
    "for this to hold true , the temperature must be negative in strain - controlled experiments because the arrival of cracks at constant strain always reduces the energy in a mesovolume .      a mean - field simplification of the model built in paper ii would reduce the hamiltonian to the sole term @xmath29 \\\\ & & -(1-q)\\epsilon   \\overline{\\psi } \\left[\\kappa_2 \\delta^2   +   \\kappa_3 \\gamma^{2}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the strain dilatation , @xmath31 the shear strain , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are combinations of the elastic moduli all as defined in paper ii .",
    "the second term is strictly negative and represents the weakening of the rock due to the crack porosity which is proportional to @xmath34 , the volume average of the positive field @xmath35 .",
    "therefore this mean - field hamiltonian is maximum when @xmath36 , which uniquely corresponds to the uniform intact state @xmath37 .",
    "the interesting term is the interaction energy @xmath38 . as defined in the summary of paper ii",
    "( the reader should consult this summary for the definition of all the terms in what follows ) , @xmath26 is a sum over wavenumbers @xmath39 of orthogonal quadratic forms involving @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which are vectors containing the @xmath42-space fourier modes of the order - parameter fields @xmath11 and @xmath43 .",
    "the sign of these forms is determined by the sign of the two eigenvalues of the symmetric matrices @xmath44 . for any @xmath39 ,",
    "at least one of the eigenvalues is positive , since @xmath45\\cdot p_{\\ka } \\cdot [ 1,0]^{t }   = l_{\\ka } = \\delta ^{2}\\kappa ^{2}_{1}(1-\\alpha u^{2}_{\\ka } ) > 0 $ ] where @xmath46 and @xmath47 is a cosine . to determine the sign of the second eigenvalue , it is sufficient to take the determinant of @xmath44 . using @xmath48 , it is straightforward to show that @xmath49^{2}.\\ ] ] this is strictly positive for every @xmath39 , except when @xmath50 in which case the determinant and second eigenvalue are zero .",
    "the vanishing of the determinant is thus independent of the norm of @xmath39 , and takes place at either of two conjugate angles @xmath51 or @xmath52 where @xmath53 represents the angle between @xmath54 and the crack - orientation vector @xmath55 .",
    "the directions in @xmath54-space at which the determinant vanishes will be denoted by the unit vectors @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the matrices @xmath44 are positive definite ; _ i.e. _ , they have two strictly positive eigenvalues , except for those particular wavevectors lying along one of the two directions for which they become positive degenerate . the eigenvector of @xmath44 associated with the zero eigenvalues is easily computed to be @xmath57^{t } $ ] .",
    "the positive - definite quadratic forms of @xmath26 are multiplied by a negative constant which implies that the maximum of @xmath38 occurs when @xmath58 for every non - zero @xmath39 with the exception of those @xmath39 satisfying eq .",
    "( [ eq : cond , k ] ) . at these degenerate angles ,",
    "the fourier modes of @xmath11 and @xmath43 are related as @xmath59 now , the definition of the auxiliary field @xmath60 imposes a series of constraints between @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the simplest is obtained by noting that the space - integrals of @xmath63 and @xmath64 must be the same which is equivalent to @xmath65 for a crack - state maximizing @xmath38 , this condition further requires that @xmath66 it will be seen momentarily that along the directions @xmath56 , the factors @xmath67 are equal , and that this quantity is an increasing function of the shear - strain parameter @xmath68 , starting at a strictly negative value when @xmath69 ( no shear deformation yet applied ) , and reaching @xmath70 at a particular value @xmath71 . for every wavevector , @xmath72 is trivially positive , and the definition of @xmath43 also requires that @xmath73 for any crack state . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ctrainte , dir , part ] ) , we can conclude that for @xmath74 , the only crack - states maximizing the interaction term @xmath38 must satisfy both @xmath75 and , for every non - zero @xmath39 , @xmath58 . such a maximum thus corresponds to a spatially uniform crack field .    at the degenerate point @xmath76",
    ", the set of maximizing crack states goes through a drastic change .",
    "any non - zero fourier mode of @xmath11 and @xmath43 along the directions @xmath56 no longer modifies @xmath38 so long as @xmath75 ; _ i.e. _ , so long as the crack field has the same sign over the entire mesovolume .",
    "this degeneracy of @xmath38 at @xmath76 is at the origin of the localization phase transition .",
    "the critical value @xmath71 , and the corresponding wavevectors @xmath39 for which non - zero fourier modes of @xmath11 and @xmath43 do not contribute to @xmath38 , are determined from the two conditions @xmath77 using the solution of eq .",

    "thus , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : det , p , zero])([eq : lsquare , minus , msquare , zero ] ) can only be satisfied by @xmath83 with a radial confining pressure maintained constant , and a positive shear stress @xmath84 , the strain components of the rock satisfy @xmath85 and @xmath86 so that @xmath87 is a positive and monotonically increasing function of the axial stress , until the rock possibly exhibits some positive volumetric strain ( we will later show that this does not occur prior to localization ) , where this quantity diverges to @xmath88 and increases further starting from @xmath89 .",
    "all of this establishes that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : det , p , zero ] ) and ( [ eq : lsquare , minus , msquare , zero ] ) have no solution until the first solution @xmath90 is reached . at this particular strain value ,",
    "non - zero fourier modes of @xmath11 and @xmath43 having any wavevector lying in one of the two directions defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : kac ] ) can be added to a mesovolume with no change in the interaction energy .    for quartz as the rock mineral ,",
    "@xmath91 so that we find @xmath92 at the transition .",
    "our model thus predicts the localization transition to occur after a sign reversal of @xmath93 but prior to the point where @xmath94 changes sign .",
    "these results are consistent with what is observed in usual triaxial mechanical experiments ( _ e.g. _   @xcite ) .",
    "it can now be algebraically verified using the definitions of @xmath95 and @xmath96 given in paper ii , that @xmath67 does not depend on the norm @xmath97 nor on which of the two directions @xmath56 is selected .",
    "further , it increases monotonically from a negative value to reach zero when @xmath98 ( facts used in obtaining the above results ) .      the goal here is to define the geometric nature of the states maximizing @xmath38 at the strain point @xmath71 .",
    "necessary conditions on the structure of the degenerate states were just given and these are easily made into sufficient conditions .",
    "first , the degenerate states must correspond to crack fields of constant sign .",
    "they thus satisfy everywhere @xmath99 or @xmath100 or , equivalently , @xmath101 or @xmath102 . considering this together with the necessary conditions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : zero , eigenvect ] ) and ( [ eq : det , p , zero ] ) , requires that the degenerate states be one of two types : ( 1 ) @xmath103 everywhere and the only possible non - zero fourier modes of @xmath11 have wavevector directions that satisfy @xmath104 ; or ( 2 ) @xmath105 everywhere and the wavevector directions satisfy @xmath106 . using again the definitions of @xmath107 given in the summary of paper ii",
    ", the first type of degenerate mode corresponds to wavevectors satisfying @xmath108 and @xmath109 , while the second type of mode has the same sine requirement , but an opposite value for the cosine .",
    "using @xmath110 to represent the wavevector direction corresponding to the first condition , and @xmath111 the wavevector direction for the second condition , we conclude that the emergent degenerate crack states consist either of right - inclined cracks with spatial fluctuations forming bands perpendicular to @xmath110 , or of left - inclined cracks forming bands perpendicular to @xmath111 .",
    "such geometry is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : orientation , bandes , conjuguees ] .",
    "these two sets of crack modes are conjugate to each other ; _ i.e. _ , symmetric to each other under inversion of the radial axis . since they become statistically important as @xmath112 , whereas the intact state or uniform states are the important states prior to @xmath71 , the system spontaneously breaks its symmetry at the transition , which is characteristic of a continuous phase transition .",
    "further , the angle formed by these bands is at @xmath113 from the axial direction . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : kac ] ) and the definitions of @xmath114 and @xmath115 in terms of the lam parameters , it is found that this angle is typically between @xmath116 and @xmath117 depending on the rock mineral @xcite considered which is consistent with laboratory experiments .",
    "finally , we note that these special crack bands that leave @xmath26 unchanged , make a negative contribution to the hamiltonian through the mean - field energy @xmath118 that is proportional to @xmath119 . due to the @xmath120 range of elastic interactions",
    ", @xmath26 is independent of the norm of @xmath121 ( it depends only on its orientation ) .",
    "thus , the spatial variation of the bands perpendicular to their lateral extent has no influence on @xmath26 ; it only affects @xmath25 through the number of cracks present . for large systems and a narrow band of only a few cell widths , @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the linear size of a cell ( grain ) and of a mesovolume .",
    "thus , such a thin band makes a negligible contribution to @xmath125 for large systems , and is energetically equivalent to the intact state .",
    "however , states with numerous and/or wide bands can make a non - negligible contribution to @xmath34 and are , therefore , less probable .",
    "so this transition indeed corresponds to `` localized '' structures .",
    "only those states with a small number of small width bands along the special directions are the statistically emergent ones as is observed in actual experiments on rocks .",
    "the sum over crack states in eq .",
    "( [ eq : part , function , principle ] ) is equivalent to the functional integration @xmath126/t}.\\ ] ] since our hamiltonian is expressed in terms of the fourier modes @xmath127 , it is shown in standard textbooks @xcite that @xmath6 further transforms to @xmath128/t}\\ ] ] where @xmath129 and @xmath130 are the real and imaginary part of @xmath61 , and @xmath131 is a half - space of the set of the wavevectors corresponding to the non - zero modes ; _ i.e. _ , corresponding in 2d to the discrete set @xmath132 with @xmath133 .",
    "there is a small - wavelength cutoff given by @xmath134 that ensures that @xmath11 does not vary on scales smaller than that of a cell , and there is the arbitrary criterion @xmath135 made to divide this space into two symmetrical parts . equation ( [ eq : z , fourier ] ) is valid up to a multiplicative constant that has no physical importance since the properties of a system correspond to the derivatives of the free energy @xmath12 .",
    "an analytic approximation for @xmath6 is obtained by performing the functional integration over a properly chosen subset of all the possible crack - states .",
    "the definition of this subset is based on what was learned in the preceeding section ; namely , that among the states having a given non - zero crack occupation @xmath34 , the most probable are the uniform states , and precisely at the phase transition , certain banded states may arrive at almost no energy cost , and these emergent states also have the same sign over space .",
    "thus , the geometrical characteristic of all such states in the `` functional neighborhood '' of the minimizing state is that in each one , all cracks are oriented in the same direction ( either left or right ) .",
    "this property justifies making a so - called `` constant - sign '' ( or `` mean - phase '' ) approximation for the partition function in which only those states in which the sign does not change in space will be considered .",
    "this still includes a huge range of states in which @xmath11 spatially varies .",
    "the excluded states in this approximation are guaranteed to have lower probabilities than the included ones and , as such , should have a negligible influence on the physical properties of the system . in this aproximation ,",
    "the fourier modes of the auxiliary @xmath43 field are trivially related to those of @xmath11 as either @xmath101 for the positive states , or @xmath102 for the negative states .",
    "we now rescale the temperature as @xmath136 . from the definition @xmath137 and the fact that @xmath138 is an energy density independent of @xmath139",

    "if the system deformation is plotted as a function of the pixel size , it is expected that when the pixels are smaller than the emergent band structures , the system deformation will decrease as a powerlaw of increasing pixel size as was observed by bonnet and davy . however , at a particular pixel size there is a cross over to a constant system deformation as pixel size increases .",
    "the pixel size at the cross - over point is at least an indirect measurement of the correlation length @xmath365 above which a volume - averaged description of the system holds with properties independent of the pixel size .",
    "second , a direct measurement of the autocorrelation between cracks can in principal be obtained via acoustic - emissions monitoring @xcite .",
    "however , the present resolution of this method ( millimeters in centimeter - scale specimens ) and the difficulty in determing the mode of the individual crack events prevents having a satisfactory sampling for statistical analysis .",
    "it seems that improvements on these present limitations are possible .",
    "last , by analogy with the probing of spin populations by electromagnetic waves to study the ferro / paramagnetic transitions , it should be possible to send plane sound waves through a system and measure the scattering cross - section as the waves scatter from the structure of the evolving microcrack population .",
    "we have not yet obtained the rigorous connection between such a measured cross - section and the fourier - transform of our autocorrelation function ; however , such a relation almost certainly exists . no experimental attempts to measure",
    "the correlation function of cracking systems in this manner has been attempted to our knowledge .",
    "we now summarize the principal results that have emerged in our study .",
    "first , we have demonstrated that at a well - defined strain point @xmath372 , thin bands of coherently oriented cracks can be added to the system at no energetic cost .",
    "such localized structures break the symmetry that held when @xmath373 and correspond to a phase transition that we named the `` localization transition '' .",
    "it was demonstrated that the free energy @xmath18 and entropy of the system remain continuous and finite at the localization transition which justifies calling it a critical - point phenomena .",
    "such continuity also demonstrates that the stress / strain behaviour of the rock is entirely analytic up to and including localization .",
    "the only divergence at localization is in the second derivatives of @xmath18 with respect to the external field @xmath19 .",
    "the consequence is that the correlation length ( aspect ratio ) of the emergent crack clusters diverges as @xmath374 . presumably , if the `` mean - phase '' approximation had not been invoked and if order - parameter contributions proportional to @xmath375 and higher had been retained in the hamiltonian through a renormalization scheme , then a non - trivial exponent on this scaling law might emerge .",
    "the mechanical behavior of the system at localization exhibits many qualities observed in actual experiments on rocks .",
    "first , the stress components at localization are reduced relative to their values if the rock had remained intact .",
    "the total dilatation @xmath252 remains negative at localization , even though the radial strain is positive . with radial confining",
    "stress kept constant , the tangent moduli @xmath376 are , most normally , negative at localization indicating that the load curve has already gone through a smooth quadratic peak stress prior to localization .",
    "nonetheless , for rocks with a sufficiently low bulk modulus and at sufficiently low confining pressures , the localization can occur in the hardening regime , presumably followed by a sharp peak stress corresponding to the unstable coalescence of cracks as the sample fails along a shear band .",
    "these results are consistent with what experimentalists observe .    using the exact differential equation that controls the temperature in the theory , it has been demonstrated that the temperature is becoming even more negative at localization which means that the temperature is always finite at localization .",
    "unfortunately , the exact value @xmath377 of the temperature at localization is difficult to obtain because it is a result of integrating the differential equation from the initial conditions .",
    "although this could be done numerically , we have instead used an approximate value of @xmath377 based on a non - interacting crack model .    by far the most important signature of the localization transition",
    "is the divergence of the aspect ratio of the crack clusters .",
    "as reported , no definitive experimental work has yet been performed to test this prediction and we hope that experimentalists take this as a challenge ."
