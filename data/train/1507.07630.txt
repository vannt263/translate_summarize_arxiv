    "gauge - higgs unification ( ghu ) @xcite is one of the attractive scenarios beyond the standard model(sm ) , which provides a possible solution to the hierarchy problem without supersymmetry @xcite . in this scenario , the sm higgs boson and the gauge fields",
    "are unified into the higher dimensional gauge fields , _",
    "i.e. _ higgs boson is identified with extra spatial components of higher dimensional gauge fields . due to this , the quantum correction to higgs mass is uv - finite and calculable due to the higher dimensional gauge symmetry though the theory is the non - renormalizable @xcite .",
    "the finiteness of other physical observables have been investigated @xcite .",
    "the fact that the yukawa couplings are governed by the gauge principle may deviate from the sm one@xcite .",
    "actually , in the flat extra dimensional case , the ratio of yukawa coupling of ghu and the sm one is derived as @xmath1 it is because the higgs fields @xmath2 appears the wilson line phase which is defined by @xmath3   = { \\rm exp } \\left [ ig_4 \\pi r a_y^{(0 ) } \\right ] , \\label{wilson}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 are 5d and 4d gauge couplings , respectively .",
    "namely , @xmath5 is periodic with respect to @xmath6 under @xmath7 so that the yukawa couplings @xmath8 in this scenario becomes periodic as shown in eq .",
    "( [ f_ghu ] ) .",
    "although the above result is general feature in such a scenario , but their model@xcite is not realistic .",
    "a crucial point is that the brane mass terms of the fermions are not included .",
    "they are necessary for generating the flavor mixing@xcite and removing the exotic massless fermions absent in the sm .",
    "therefore , it is important to study the deviation of yukawa coupling in a realistic model to incorporate the appropriate brane mass terms .",
    "we consider an @xmath9 ghu model in a five - dimensional flat space - time compactified on @xmath10 with the radius @xmath11 of @xmath12 .",
    "the up - type quarks except for the top quark , the down - type quarks and the charged leptons are embedded into @xmath13 and @xmath14 representations of @xmath15 , respectively @xcite . in order to realize the large top yukawa coupling ,",
    "the top quark is embedded into @xmath16 representation of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions are assigned to reproduce the sm fields as the zero modes . a periodic boundary condition with respect to @xmath12",
    "is taken for all of the bulk sm fields , and the @xmath17 parity is assigned for the gauge fields and fermions in the representation @xmath18 by using the parity matrix @xmath19 in the following .",
    "@xmath20 where the subscripts @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) denotes the four ( the fifth ) dimensional component . with this choice of parities , zero - mode vector bosons in the model",
    "are only the sm gauge fields .",
    "this parity assignment also leaves exotic massless fermions which is not included in the sm .",
    "such exotic fermions are made massive by introducing brane localized fermions with conjugate @xmath23 charges and an opposite chirality to the exotic fermions , allowing us to write brane - localized dirac mass terms .",
    "these brane localized mass terms are also very important to generate the flavor mixing in the context of ghu @xcite .    in this context",
    ", the deviation of the tau and the bottom yukawa couplings in ghu from the sm one has been obtained as @xcite @xmath24\\sin^2\\theta }          { 1-\\cos(2\\pi rm_w ) - \\left[\\cos(2 \\sqrt 2 \\pi rm_w)-\\cos\\left ( 2\\pi rm_w \\right)\\right]\\sin^2\\theta}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath25 is a mixing angle between two @xmath26 doublet zero modes existing per generation @xcite .",
    "we can easily show that they reduce to the eq .",
    "( [ f_ghu ] ) or the result in the previous work@xcite for the case @xmath27 .",
    "in this section , we calculate the signal strength of @xmath28 .",
    "the higgs production is dominated by the gluon fusion process at the lhc and calculated from the coefficient of the following dimension five operator between the higgs and the digluon , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the gluon field strength .    in ghu , we have to take into account the kk top loop contributions , which is found to be @xmath31 where the first factor behind @xmath32 denotes the ratio for the top yukawa coupling and the second factor is a multiplicity of the same kk mass spectrum .",
