    "m80 is one of the densest globular clusters ( gcs ) in the milky way , and is famous for the classical nova t  scorpii which was discovered in 1860 when it outshone the rest of the cluster . despite the many observations that resulted from the discovery of the nova , only a few variable sources are known in m80 ( wehlau 1990 , clement , private communication , kopacki 2009 ) .    here , we report the results of a variability study based on our far ultra - violet ( fuv ) survey of m80 ( dieball et al .",
    "2010 ; henceforth paper  1 ) . we have discovered three stars which exhibit significant variability , the most interesting of which is an rrlyrae star in the core of the cluster .",
    "this star , which we call tdk1 , was observed around the peak of the light curve in our observations , manifesting a high - amplitude ( @xmath7 mag ) , luminous ( @xmath8 ) , short - duration ( @xmath9 ) fuv brightening .",
    "further investigation using archive data show that it is also variable in optical wavebands but the data coverage is not sufficient to determine the period of the variation .",
    "the other two new variables discovered in our survey include another possible rrlyrae and an sxphoenicis star .",
    "finally , we discuss the fuv counterparts to two known variables : the famous nova t  scorpii and the known dwarf nova dn1 ( shara & drissen 1995 ) .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : in section  [ obs ] , we describe the observations and data analysis , including the fuv survey and analysis of archive hst observations of tdk1 .",
    "the variable sources identified in the cluster are discussed in section  [ variables ] .",
    "our results are summarized in section  [ summary ] .",
    "our uv survey of the core of m80 consisted of seven orbits of hst observations using the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) .",
    "six orbits were spent on fuv imaging , using the f165lp ( four consecutive orbits resulting in 32 individual images ) , the f150lp ( one orbit corresponding to eight images ) and f140lp ( one orbit , eight images ) filters in the solar blind channel ( sbc ) .",
    "the remaining orbit was used for near ultra - violet ( nuv ) imaging , using the f220w filter in the high resolution channel ( hrc ) and resulting in eight individual images .",
    "all observations were taken at a single pointing position .",
    "table  [ data ] gives an overview of the uv data .",
    ".uv and optical data used to study the variable source tdk1 .",
    "the first column gives the camera used , followed by the filter ( col .",
    "2 ) , the number of images taken ( col .",
    "3 ) , the date of observation ( col .  4 ) and the individual exposure time ( col .  5 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath10 in the f555w filter image , only eight comparison stars were used as the ninth was outside the field of view .",
    "photometric measurements based on the available hst optical imagery ( see section  [ tdk1_other_wavelengths ] ) show , as might be expected , that tdk1 is variable in all wavebands .",
    "table  [ tdk1_table ] shows the rms and peak - to - peak magnitude variation for tdk1 , and the average values for the nine comparison stars .",
    "tdk1 exhibits more variability than the comparison stars in all bands .",
    "the variability in all wavebands makes placing tdk1 on a colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) something of a challenge .",
    "figure [ fig_cmd ] shows the cmd of m80 , with the variable sources highlighted . for tdk1 ,",
    "the uv magnitudes are the averages from the orbits in which it was faintest in order to minimise the effect of variability on the cmd position . in the uv cmd",
    ", tdk1 is located close to the blue horizontal branch ( bhb)/blue straggler ( bs ) region , as might be expected for an rrlyrae , although its position is still subject to error due to variability even excluding the data taken during the peak of the light curve .",
    "the optical cmd was created using data from piotto et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , in which the average magnitudes from two f439w and four f555w observations were used ( observations taken in 1996 ; see table [ data ] ) ; piotto s location for tdk1 is indicated with subscript p. to minimise the effect of variability in these two wavebands , we also plot the ` low - state ' position of tdk1 , marked tdk1@xmath11 . to do this we used the faintest data point in each band and converted them to johnson magnitudes using the iraf / stsdas package synphot .",
    "this brings tdk1 much closer to the bhb .",
    "as explained in more detail in section [ sed ] , tdk1 was not exactly at minimum brightness in these observations , so this is still not the true low state ; furthermore , the f555w data was taken at a brighter point in the cycle than the f439w data , making the source appear redder than if they were taken simultaneously .",
    "we conclude that , subject to errors due to variability , tdk1 s position on both cmds is consistent with it being an rrlyrae .      in order to confirm that tdk1 is an rrlyrae star ,",
    "as suggested by the variability in the fuv and optical wavebands , we constructed the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of tdk1 . in doing so we tried to use observations taken when the star was close to minimum brightness ( ` low state ' ) , but we caution that lack of truly low - state observations mean the sed produced is still not actually that of minimum brightness . for the fuv and nuv we used the average magnitude from the faintest orbits ; for f165lp we include only the average magnitude from the last eight data points to minimise the effect of the large magnitude variation exhibited in the light curve .",
    "we also tried excluding the f165lp data entirely , and found that this did not significantly change the results . for the optical bands we know , as shown in table [ tdk1_table ] , that there was some variability present in each dataset .",
    "in fact , tdk1 is undergoing brightening in the 1996 observations ( the last two f439w images , followed by the four f555w images ; see table [ data ] ) , and again in the 1997 observations ( three f675w observations followed by three f656n observations ) . to minimise the effect of this variability we used the faintest magnitude measurement for each filter , to give the best possible approximation of a low - state sed . while we expect that this issue will produce errors of a few tenths of a mag in each waveband , it is sufficiently accurate to get an idea of the shape of the sed and to estimate parameters such as temperature and radius .",
    "tdk1 s sed is shown in figure  [ fig_sed_synphot ] ( black data points ) .",
    "each point is plotted at the pivot wavelength for the corresponding filter .",
    "the sed is consistent with a single star .",
    "figure  [ fig_sed_synphot ] also shows that the source appears brighter in the narrow - band f656n filter than in the bracketing optical broadband data points in the sed , suggesting an @xmath12 excess .",
    "synthetic photometry was carried out for models in the kurucz ( 1993 ) grid using the iraf / stsdas package synphot and assuming a distance of 10 kpc , a reddening of @xmath13 mag and a metallicity of @xmath14}=-1.75 $ ] dex .",
    "the synthetic seds were then fit to the data using a least squares fitting method , in which each point was given equal weight .",
    "we found that tdk1 s sed can be reasonably described by a star with @xmath4k , @xmath5 , and log @xmath15 , giving a mass of @xmath16 .",
    "these values are all within the acceptable range for rrlyrae stars .    in order to estimate the contribution of the @xmath12 line to the underlying stellar spectrum",
    ", we repeated the synthetic photometry including an @xmath12 line of varying equivalent width ( ew ) .",
    "the best fit model suggests a marginally significant ( @xmath17 ) @xmath12 line with ew@xmath18 , without significantly affecting the other fit parameters .",
    "the best fit sed , including an @xmath12 line with ew@xmath18 , is plotted as a blue line in figure  [ fig_sed_synphot ] .",
    "the presence of an @xmath12 line can be explained by the fact that tdk1 is undergoing a brightening phase during the f656n and f675w observations .",
    "this adds further evidence that tdk1 is a type  ab rrlyrae , as these are known to exhibit @xmath12 emission during rising light ( smith 1995 ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig_sed_synphot ] , the models do not fit well to the observed slope in the optical data ; the data in this region shows a much steeper slope ( i.e. bluer colour ) than the models .",
    "as the pivot wavelengths for the optical filters are similar , the colours indicated by comparisons between these filters are sensitive to , and can be easily distorted by , variability .",
    "the variability that we observe in the optical filters ( a few tenths of a mag ) is , therefore , sufficient to account for the very blue optical colour of tdk1 .",
    "fitting the slope of the optical data alone gives a far higher @xmath19 than our best - fit model .",
    "in fact , such a model over predicts the brightness in the uv by such a large amount that it becomes impossible to account for the observed uv magnitudes .",
    "furthermore , it is the data taken using the f140lp and f150lp filters that we trust most to have been taken in the low - state .",
    "thus , @xmath19 can be well determined by ensuring that the model is a good match to the magnitudes obtained using the f140lp and f150lp filters .",
    "it is worth noting that while @xmath19 is well constrained by the turnover in the sed and the radius by the flux normalization to m80 s distance , the global shape of the sed can be reasonably well described using a range of log @xmath20 values .",
    "thus , a slight change in input @xmath19 or @xmath21 has a huge impact on the model sed , whereas large changes in log @xmath20 only have relatively small effects .",
    "rrlyrae stars have been noted to have a wide range of log @xmath20 values ( see pea et al .",
    "2009 for examples of rrlyraes with log @xmath20 values of 1.3 to 2.2 at minimum brightness , and 2.5 to 3.5 at maximum ) , so while our best - fit value of log @xmath22 is reasonable , we caution that variability in the data limits our ability to make a reliable determination of log @xmath20 and , consequently , the mass .",
    "by contrast , the temperature and radius estimates should be fairly reliable .",
    "we conclude , based on the radius and temperature obtained from the sed and the suggestion of h@xmath23 excess during the brightening phase , that tdk1 is indeed an rrlyrae star .",
    "the log @xmath20 and mass values obtained are also consistent with this explanation , but are less reliable as they are affected more significantly by slight variations in magnitude .      in this section ,",
    "we briefly discuss the nature of two other sources in our catalogue that showed strong signs of fuv variability .",
    "the light curve of tdk2 ( source no .",
    "2238 in paper  1 ; see figure  [ fig_lightcurve_3_vars ] ) shows short - term variability with a peak to peak variation of @xmath24 mag .",
    "figure  [ fig_periodogram_2238 ] presents the lomb - scargle periodogram , which suggests a period of @xmath25 minutes .",
    "figure [ fig_folded_lightcurve_2238 ] displays the light curve of tdk2 , folded on this period , along with a sinusoidal fit which suggests a semi - amplitude of 0.45 mag .",
    "the position of tdk2 is in the blue straggler ( bs ) region in both the uv and optical cmds ( figure  [ fig_cmd ] ) .",
    "this , together with the period of @xmath26 hour , suggests that tdk2 is an sxphoenicis star .",
    "sxphoenicis stars are pulsating bs stars with periods of @xmath27 hours and optical amplitudes of @xmath28mag .",
    "they are population ii stars and are far more commonly found in gcs than in the field ( rodrguez & lpez - gonzlez 2000 ; jeon et al .",
    "they are located in the bs region or the lowest part of the instability strip on the cmd , in the region associated with ( population i ) @xmath29scuti stars , so are thought to be their low metallicity counterparts .",
    "the physical characteristics of sxphoenicis stars are not well explained by current theory , and the origin of bs stars is still a topic of discussion ( see e.g. , knigge et al . 2009 ) .",
    "further observations would be needed to determine additional information about tdk2 .",
    "the short time span over which the observations were taken in our survey limit our ability to determine the period to a high level of accuracy , or detect the presence of multiple pulsation modes . if a pulsation spectrum could be obtained , parameters such as mass and metallicity may be found and could lead to new insights into the formation and evolution of sxphoenicis stars and bs stars in general .      the light curve of our source tdk3 ( source no .",
    "2324 in paper  1 ) , shown in figure  [ fig_lightcurve_3_vars ] , displays variability with @xmath30 mag semi - amplitude , with a period significantly longer than the timespan of our fuv observations .",
    "our data coverage is not good enough to attempt a period determination for such long - term trends .",
    "based on its position in the cmds ( figure  [ fig_cmd ] ) , however , tdk3 is likely to be another rrlyrae star or a cepheid variable .",
    "the shallow rise in brightness makes a type  ab rrlyrae scenario unlikely , but tdk3 could be a type  c rrlyrae star .",
    "rrc stars have shorter periods than rrab ( @xmath31 days ) and fuv amplitudes of 1.3 - 3.3 mag ( downes et al .",
    "2004 ) , while cepheid variables have periods on the order of days , with fuv amplitudes of around 1 magnitude ( smith et al . 2005 ; moffett et al .",
    "both of these are plausible explanations for the lightcurve of tdk3 ; our data does not allow us to constrain the parameters of tdk3 enough to determine which is the most likely option .",
    "in addition to the sources described above which were identified in our variability search of the fuv data , we also discuss the fuv counterparts to two well - known variable sources , the classical nova tsco and the dwarf nova dn1 .",
    "source number 2129 in our fuv catalogue was identified by us ( see paper  1 ) as the counterpart to the classical nova tscorpii .",
    "this source was not strongly variable in our fuv observations .",
    "in fact , after subtracting trends due to psf changes over hst s orbital period that were present in the light curves of the brightest sources , tsco exhibits only very small scale variability in the fuv data , with amplitude @xmath32 magnitudes .",
    "bruch ( 1992 ) suggests nova flickering amplitudes of a few tenths of a magnitude and one would expect more variation in the bluer wavebands , but this was not detected .",
    "as described in paper  1 , tsco was among the brightest objects in our fuv catalogue ( fuv @xmath33 mag ) .",
    "it was also the bluest object in the catalogue ; in fact , it was found to be unphysically blue ( @xmath34 mag ; an infinite temperature blackbody would have @xmath35 mag ) , so must have decreased in brightness in the month between the fuv and nuv observations , implying that tsco was in a high state during the fuv observations .",
    "we suggest , therefore , that the flickering normally observed in the light curves of classical novae might be suppressed because we caught the source in a high state .",
    "the implied fuv outburst is interesting , as we can not rule out the possibility that tsco is , in fact , a recurrent nova , although this is probably a far - fetched explanation for the inferred fuv brightening ; a dn eruption , for example , is a much more likely scenario .",
    "source number 1387 in our catalogue is the relatively faint fuv counterpart to x - ray source cx07 identified by heinke et al .",
    "this source is also dn1 , one of the dne found by shara & drissen ( 1995 ) .",
    "again , this source did not exhibit detectable variability in our fuv data .",
    "however , dn1 is a relatively faint fuv source ( fuv@xmath36 ) , so instrumental errors are large ( @xmath37 mag ) and limit our ability to draw any conclusions about the presence or absence of flickering on orbital variations .",
    "we used 32 individual fuv images from our uv survey of the core region of m80 ( dieball et al .",
    "2010 ; referred to throughout this paper as paper  1 ) to search for variable sources in our fuv catalogue .",
    "three sources exhibit strong evidence for variability .",
    "tdk1 ( paper  1 s source no .",
    "2817 ) is an rrlyrae in the core of the cluster .",
    "the fuv light curve shows that it was observed from around 40 minutes before to 4.5 hours after maximum brightness , and further investigation using archival wfpc2 optical data showed that it is clearly variable in all wavebands .",
    "its sed is reasonably well described by a star of temperature @xmath38k and radius @xmath39 , consistent with expected parameters for an rrlyrae star .",
    "more specifically , we show that tdk1 is a type  ab rrlyrae , based on the asymmetry in the fuv light curve .",
    "this is only the third cluster in which an rrlyrae star has been identified based on uv observations ( others were found in ngc1851 by downes et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and m15 by dieball et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ) .",
    "uv surveys can be useful tools in identifying rrlyraes and similar objects , particularly in the cores of ( dense ) gcs where optical surveys are seriously hampered by crowding .",
    "tdk2 ( source no .",
    "2238 in paper  1 ) is likely an sxphoenicis star with a period of @xmath40 minutes and amplitude of @xmath26mag .",
    "tdk3 ( source no .",
    "2324 ) might be another rrlyrae or a cepheid .    finally , we discussed two well known variable sources , tsco and dn1 , the fuv counterparts of which were recovered in our survey .",
    "tsco exhibited surprisingly little flickering in our fuv data , possiby because it was in a high state compared with the nuv observations a month later .",
    "dn1 is a very faint uv source , so photometric errors dominate over any possible intrinsic flickering or other variations .",
    "after this paper was completed , we found that tdk1 and tdk3 are included in kopacki s variability survey of m80 ( kopacki , private communication ) .",
    "kopacki agrees with our classification of these two sources as rrlyrae stars .",
    "a preliminary summary of his results , including periods but not including coordinates or finder charts for the sources , is given in kopacki ( 2009 ) .",
