    "usually in experiments the vortices destroy superfluidity at velocities far below the landau critical velocity .",
    "this is why the superfluid hydrodynamics equations can be expanded in powers of low velocities and one safely uses the first nontrivial terms of this expansion .",
    "nevertheless , there is a number of experiments ( see @xcite ) where the superfluid flow is investigated in small orifices .",
    "it has been shown that in these circumstances the maximum velocity is a decreasing function of the orifice width and may reach the order of the landau critical velocity if the aperture is small enough .",
    "this means that all thermodynamic quantities of the superfluid become nontrivial functions of the not small superfluid velocity ( _ i.e. , _  it depends not only on the usual thermodynamic coordinates such as pressure and temperature ) .",
    "the only assumption one can make ( and we do it ) is that the fluid at rest is isotropic .",
    "this quite general statement of the problem is used in the paper ; we find the complete set of thermodynamic inequalities in this light , _",
    "i.e. , _  the conditions imposed on thermodynamic functions for the superfluid to remain stable .",
    "finally we employ the landau phonon - roton model to calculate the highest velocity compatible with obtained thermodynamic inequalities and show that it can be interpreted as a critical velocity .",
    "this thermodynamic scenario supposedly explains the superfluidity break - up in small orifices .",
    "when deriving general superfluid hydrodynamic equations it is usually supposed  @xcite that each infinitesimal volume of the liquid is ( locally ) in equilibrium and this equilibrium is stable . for the state of the liquid to be stable",
    ", it should provide an entropy maximum ( at least local ) for an isolated system . instead of investigating the condition of the entropy maximality ,",
    "it is convenient  @xcite to use another , equivalent to the first one , condition , that is the condition of the energy minimality under constant entropy and additive integrals of motion .",
    "thus , to examine if the state is stable or not , one must investigate the second variation of the energy . such analysis will provide sufficient conditions for the energy minimality .",
    "total energy of the superfluid @xmath0 is an integral of the energy density @xmath1 over the entire volume @xmath2 the energy density can be obtained via a galilean transformation @xmath3 here @xmath4  is the superfluid velocity , @xmath5 is the mass density and subscript @xmath6 denotes quantities measured in the frame of reference of the superfluid component ( that is the frame where the superfluid velocity is zero ) .",
    "namely , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the energy density and the momentum density ( or , equally , the mass flux ) with respect to the superfluid component .",
    "the former is a function of @xmath5 , @xmath8 , and the entropy density @xmath9 .",
    "its differential can be written as @xmath10 where lagrange multipliers @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the temperature , the chemical potential , and the so - called relative velocity of normal and superfluid components .",
    "the liquid is isotropic and , consequently , the velocity @xmath13 and the momentum density @xmath8 are parallel to each other , as expressed by @xmath14 this leads to a useful identity for the partial derivatives of @xmath8 with respect to @xmath13 : @xmath15 further transforming , we can rewrite it with the help of in the form @xmath16 where we denoted the total momentum density @xmath17 and the normal velocity @xmath18 .    as usual",
    ", stability implies that each `` allowed '' fluctuation increases the total energy of the system @xmath0 . allowed",
    "are the fluctuations leaving conserved quantities unchanged .",
    "this means that the minimality of @xmath0 must be investigated under fixed entropy and all additive integrals of motion : mass , momentum , and superfluid velocity .",
    "while the conservation of mass and momentum is well - known , conservation of the superfluid velocity worths a special comment . really , since the superfluid flow is irrotational , the velocity @xmath19 is a gradient of a scalar : @xmath20 .",
    "the same is true for the time derivative @xmath21 .",
    "this formula expresses the conservation of all three components of the vector @xmath22    consider a macroscopic fluctuation of all the variables @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "they are conserved and this ensures that the first variation of the total energy for a uniform system is identically zero @xmath27 the minimality criterion must be obtained as the condition of the positive definiteness of the second differential quadratic form .",
    "the matrix of this quadratic form is a jacobian matrix @xmath28 : @xmath29 common rule states that it is positive definite if all principal minors @xmath30 in the top - left corner are positive .",
    "we recursively test these minors :    * the first positivity condition @xmath31 corresponds to the usual requirement of the heat capacity positivity .",
    "it is shown below that @xmath32 , hence the last inequality eventually becomes @xmath33 * positivity of the next group of minors is easily verified with the following transformation @xmath34 whether the minors @xmath35 are positive is determined by the second multiplier in .",
    "required condition is therefore equivalent to the positive definiteness of the matrix @xmath36 here we used and chosen the direction of the @xmath13 vector as the first coordinate .",
    "this adds to our collection two more inequalities @xmath37 @xmath38 * the same transformation applied to the biggest minors gives : @xmath39 again , the minors @xmath40 correspond to nontrivial principal minors of @xmath41 .",
    "we use the thermodynamic identity to relate the chemical potential  @xmath12 and the conventional pressure  @xmath42 @xmath43 this gives @xmath44 the following is an explicit representation of @xmath41 sub - matrix corresponding to a four - dimensional space @xmath45 ; as before we let the @xmath46-axis run along @xmath13 direction .",
    "using we obtain @xmath47 + appropriate inequalities are : @xmath48 which is literally a generalized ( to a non - zero inter - component velocity @xmath49 ) positive compressibility requirement , @xmath50 and @xmath51    inequalities , , , , , and are sufficient conditions for the thermodynamic stability .",
    "in a `` stopped - normal - component '' arrangement , the mass flux @xmath52 with respect to the normal component may become more convenient than @xmath8the mass flux relative to the superfluid one .",
    "the obvious relation between them @xmath53 leads to the following reformulation of the inequalities : @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57    as a simple application of the derived inequalities , consider them at @xmath58 . from , , , and we get @xmath59 @xmath60 using conventional notation , last inequality reads in the limit @xmath61 @xmath62",
    "here we provide a usage example of the stability criteria for real superfluid @xmath63 . to calculate derivatives involved in the inequalities one take refuge in the microscopic approach .",
    "simple and clear landau phonon - roton model works pretty well in wide temperature and velocity ranges .",
    "we use this model to calculate the contribution of these quasiparticles to the `` modified '' free energy in the frame of reference of the superfluid component : @xmath64 differential of this potential is given by @xmath65 the modified free energy is obtained from the excitation spectrum with a conventional formula @xmath66 we denoted the excitation energy @xmath67 , which is given for two branches by the expressions @xmath68 here and below , subscripts distinguish the quantities related to phonons and rotons , @xmath69 is the sound velocity , @xmath70 is the roton energy gap , @xmath71 is the effective mass , and @xmath72 is the momentum at the roton minimum , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 . ]",
    ". a small dimensionless parameter @xmath80 ensures , _",
    "e.g. , _  that the landau critical velocity is determined by @xmath81 .    when integrated , these dispersion laws give the following contributions to the free energy : @xmath82 one can obtain all thermodynamic variables by differentiating this potential .",
    "namely @xmath83 @xmath84    inequality is the first to become invalid .",
    "appropriate validity region is plotted in fig .",
    "the liquid is unstable above the curve .     versus temperature @xmath11 at normal pressure .",
    "dashed line corresponds to the equation @xmath85 .",
    "note that the condition @xmath86 holds true over entire stability domain .",
    "the `` stability '' critical velocity @xmath87 coincides with the landau critical velocity @xmath88 at zero temperature and vanishes completely at the critical temperature @xmath89 ( the @xmath90-point ) . in the phonon - roton model",
    "the critical temperature is @xmath91 . ]    at zero temperature the critical velocity becomes the landau critical velocity @xmath88 .",
    "it should also be noted that for systems where all quasiparticles can be described hydrodynamically ( in other words , systems lacking roton branch ) inequality at zero temperature includes @xmath92 _ i.e. , _  @xmath93 .",
    "experimentally , the superfluidity break - up in small orifices is believed to have the following nature ( see @xcite ) . until the aperture size is too small",
    "the critical velocity does not depend on the temperature and increases as the size decreases .",
    "this is the very behaviour that is specific to the vortex - related critical velocity .",
    "when the orifice width is narrow enough the vortex - related critical velocity becomes so high , that the break - up scenario and its features change .",
    "the critical velocity does not depend on the aperture any more but decreases when the temperature increases .",
    "this behaviour is commonly associated ( see @xcite ) with the iordanski - langer - fisher mechanism ( see @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , this association lacks numerical comparison because no reliable information about the actual orifice shape is available .    on the other side",
    "experimentally observed behaviour of the critical velocity can be attributed to the suggested stability criterion .",
    "in other words we provide an alternative explanation of experimental results based on an assumption that in narrow orifices the thermodynamic limit of @xmath87 is reached .",
    "we should also note that our approach to the critical velocity as a stability limit is similar to that used by kramer@xcite .",
    "actually the inequality he employed is not a thermodynamic one .",
    "moreover , generally speaking it is wrong . but numerical results for the critical velocity he obtained using the phonon - roton model do not deviate much from those plotted in fig.[crit ] .",
    "it is a pleasure for us to thank i.a.fomin for useful discussions .",
