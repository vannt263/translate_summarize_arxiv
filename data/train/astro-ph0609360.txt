    "the age distribution of a population of star clusters contains important information about the formation and disruption of the clusters .",
    "the number of embedded clusters in the solar neighborhood ( with masses @xmath6 ) declines rapidly with age , and it has been estimated that only @xmath7% of these clusters will survive for 100  myr ( see the review by lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "we recently found that much more massive ( compact ) clusters ( @xmath8 ) in the merging `` antennae '' galaxies also show a rapid decline in their age distribution , with @xmath9 ( fall , chandar , & whitmore 2005 , hereafter fcw05 ) .",
    "we interpret this decline in numbers as due to a high rate of early disruption ( `` infant mortality '' ) for massive clusters in the antennae . taken together , these age distributions suggest that compact , massive clusters in the chaotic environment of two merging disk galaxies disrupt at approximately the same rate as lower mass , embedded clusters in the more quiescent solar neighborhood .",
    "this suggests that star clusters disrupt rapidly due to processes internal to the clusters themselves ( e.g. , the removal of interstellar material due to the mass and energy input from massive stars ; hills 1980 ; fall 2004 ; fcw05 ) , and implies that the age distribution should be roughly @xmath10 in all star - forming galaxies .",
    "in contrast to the results for clusters in the milky way and in the antennae , the cluster age distribution in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) has been reported as @xmath11 ( rafelski & zaritsky 2005 ; hereafter rz05 ) .",
    "however , this age distribution is actually the number of clusters divided by the number of individual stars of the same age , i.e. , it is a _ normalized _",
    "cluster age distribution ( rz05 ) .",
    "does the proposed @xmath12 power law for the normalized cluster age distribution in the smc differ from the @xmath13 form found in the antennae and solar neighborhood because of the normalization procedure , because clusters in the smc are forming and/or dissolving at a different rate , or for some other reason ?",
    "the motivation for normalizing the number of clusters by the number of individual stars was to assess whether the formation of stars in clusters parallels the formation of stars in the field .",
    "an underlying assumption made by rz05 , then , is that star formation occurs in _ both _ clusters and in the field simultaneously .",
    "however , our study of the antennae galaxies suggests that at least 20% and possibly all of the @xmath14 flux is emitted by compact clusters , which disrupt rapidly ( fcw05 ) .",
    "this picture implies instead that at least 20% and possibly all stars form in clusters , with stars being subsequently delivered from clusters to the field through the process of cluster disruption .",
    "this in turn implies that @xmath3 and @xmath4 should have an inverse relationship to each other .",
    "if the smc cluster system is found to have an unnormalized age distribution @xmath15 , then our picture of clusters disrupting at essentially the same rate in all star - forming environments may have to be significantly revised .",
    "what is the unnormalized smc cluster age distribution , does it differ from the normalized cluster age distribution , and what is the relationship between field and cluster stars ? addressing these questions is the main focus of this letter .",
    "we use the smc cluster properties published in rz05 to directly determine the cluster age distribution .",
    "the original cluster sample was selected by hill & zaritsky ( 2006 ) , and we refer the reader to their paper for details .",
    "briefly , they identified cluster candidates using @xmath16 data from the magellanic clouds photometric survey ( mcps ; zaritsky , harris , & thompson 1997 ) .",
    "all candidate clusters detected in median - subtracted stellar images were visually inspected , and only obvious clusters were retained .",
    "clusters embedded in strong nebular emission regions were excluded from the sample due to the difficulty of measuring their true integrated colors .",
    "this leads to a significant bias against clusters younger than @xmath17  yr . due to these selection criteria and the small distance to the smc , the cluster sample of hill & zaritsky ( 2006 ) is likely to be approximately surface - brightness limited , rather than luminosity - limited ( as is typical for more distant cluster systems ) .",
    "the adopted procedure resulted in a catalog of 204 unambiguous smc clusters .",
    "basic cluster properties were estimated as follows .",
    "rz05 measured integrated @xmath16 magnitudes within the radius enclosing 90% of the v - band light from each cluster ( as tabulated in hill & zaritsky 2006 ) .",
    "they then compared the colors ( typically @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 ) with the simple stellar population ( ssp ) model predictions of starburst99 ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) and galev ( anders & fritze - v .",
    "alvensleben 2003 ) and adopted the age corresponding to the minimum @xmath21 .",
    "rz05 provide electronic tables of derived cluster ages and total v band luminosities for the clusters in their catalog .",
    "we estimated the mass of each cluster by combining the total v band luminosity provided by rz05 with theoretical , age - dependent ssp mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath22 ) , assuming a distance modulus of 18.87 ( harries et al . 2003 ) and a foreground reddening value of @xmath23 .",
    "these @xmath22 ratios assume a salpeter initial stellar mass function ( imf ) down to @xmath24 , but would be @xmath25 times lower if we had adopted a chabrier - type ( 2003 ) imf that flattens below @xmath26 .",
    "our procedure does not account for any additional extinction within the smc , which is likely higher for younger clusters , resulting in an underestimate for the masses of these objects",
    ". however , the extinction in the smc is quite small along most lines of sight ( e.g. , zaritsky 1999 ) , and adopting a single extinction value has little effect on our results .    from the above data we constructed the age distribution of star clusters in the smc , @xmath3 , by counting the number of clusters ( @xmath27 ) in different age bins . in this letter",
    ", we use cluster ages taken from the rz05 comparison with the starburst99 model ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) of metallicity z=0.004 , which is well - suited for the young cluster population in the smc .",
    "however , we have checked that our basic results are not sensitive to the adopted metallicity , population synthesis model , or bin size .",
    "the @xmath28 uncertainties are calculated as @xmath29 for each bin .",
    "the data were restricted to cover the age range over which the sample of clusters is reasonably complete down to @xmath30 .",
    "figure  1 shows the age distributions resulting from the full rz05 sample with @xmath31 , and from the approximately mass - limited sample ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "as expected , the age distribution constructed from the mass - limited sample is somewhat shallower than the one constructed from the entire cluster sample , since there are relatively few clusters more massive than @xmath33 at very young ages .",
    "both samples have a median age @xmath34 yr .",
    "this is a generous upper limit on the true median age due to the original selection , which deliberately excluded clusters in emission - line regions , with ages @xmath35  yr .",
    "regardless of this incompleteness at very young ages , the age distributions of figure  1 show that in the smc the number of clusters declines monotonically , with no obvious bends or other features .",
    "_ we find that the ( unnormalized ) cluster age distribution in the smc is well approximated by a power law of the form @xmath36 , over the range of ages studied [ @xmath37  yr ] .",
    "_ this form of the smc cluster age distribution is essentially the same as that found for star clusters in the antennae galaxies ( fcw05 ) .",
    "our result therefore , provides additional evidence for the rapid disruption of clusters due to internal processes ( `` infant mortality '' ) .",
    "this rapid decline of @xmath3 with @xmath38 naturally predicts that @xmath4 should increase with @xmath38 as dissolving clusters contribute their stars to the field .",
    "however the exact form of @xmath4 will depend on the fraction of stars that originally form in clusters . in order to explore the relationship between stars in clusters and in the field",
    ", we use the statistical cluster models presented in whitmore , chandar , & fall ( 2006 ; hereafter wcf06 ) to predict the field star age distribution . here",
    ", we provide a brief summary of the model inputs and assumptions , and refer the reader to wcf06 for details .",
    "the models allow different cluster formation histories , including a constant rate of formation and gaussian bursts . for simplicity , we assume a constant rate of cluster formation over the life of the smc , and an initial mass function of power - law form with @xmath39 as suggested by a number of recent works ( e.g. , zhang & fall 1999 ; hunter et al . 2003 ; wcf06 ) .",
    "after clusters form , they are disrupted in two phases  a rapid , mass - independent phase ( which is modelled as a power law @xmath40 , with index @xmath41 ) , and a longer - term , mass - dependent phase that mimics the effects of two - body evaporation ( modelled as constant mass loss , with a rate @xmath42 ; see fall & zhang 2001 and wcf06 for details ) . the index of the smc cluster age distribution was found in the previous section to be @xmath43 .",
    "each simulated cluster is composed of a number of stars , which are assumed to be drawn from a salpeter imf with lower and upper stellar mass limits of @xmath24 and @xmath44 respectively . the only free parameter in our model is the fraction of stars , @xmath45 , that are born initially in clusters .",
    "the models track the numbers and ages of stars in the field ( i.e. , stars which form outside of clusters initially or end up there after a cluster is disrupted ) , thus allowing us to predict @xmath4 .",
    "figure  2 shows our model predictions of @xmath4 for three different values of @xmath45 : 0.0 , 0.5 , and 1.0 . the ( solid ) curve for @xmath46 ( i.e.",
    ", _ all _ star formation occurs initially in clusters ) shows a steep rise in the number of field stars ( at very young ages ) , which is approximately the inverse of @xmath3 .",
    "however , by @xmath17  yrs the field star age distribution is essentially flat ( i.e. , @xmath47 ) .",
    "this effect can be understood as follows : when @xmath3 is plotted logarithmically , the _ rate _ at which the cluster population diminishes is observed as the slope , @xmath41 . however , if @xmath48 were plotted linearly rather than logarithmically , one would see that the number of clusters declines quickly at first , and then begins to flatten out .",
    "the field star age distribution is roughly the inverse of the cluster age distribution , and so must necessarily rise very quickly as stars are dispersed into the field .",
    "this increasing function essentially `` saturates '' by @xmath17  yrs , predicting that @xmath4 varies rapidly only for a short time .",
    "is the field star age distribution in the smc consistent with most stars forming in clusters ?",
    "harris & zaritsky ( 2004 ; hereafter hz04 ) present the star formation history of the smc .",
    "they use all detected stars ( i.e. , in both clusters and in the field ) , from the mcps ground - based data .",
    "however , there is a natural bias in their stellar catalog against stars in clusters , due to their inability to photometer in dense regions .",
    "therefore , we refer to stars in their sample as belonging to the `` field '' .",
    "we determine the number of smc stars as a function of age by dividing the star formation rates presented in table  2 of hz04 by the mean stellar mass .",
    "figure  2 shows a comparison of the field star age distribution in the smc with our model predictions .",
    "this shows that over the observed range the field star age distribution is essentially flat ( although see hz04 for a detailed analysis of small - scale variations in the star formation history ) .",
    "unfortunately , the youngest age in the hz04 compilation is just where the predicted rise in the field star age distribution begins to flatten , making it impossible to determine @xmath45 with this data set .",
    "additionally , the hz04 data do not discriminate between stars in clusters and stars in the field , which results in `` pollution '' of @xmath4 from cluster stars .",
    "nevertheless , figure  2 shows that despite @xmath4 being rather flat , _ the smc field star data do not contradict our scenario where most star formation occurs in short - lived clusters_. our simulations establish that even if 100% of stars formed originally in clusters , their rapid rate of disruption creates the field star population so quickly that after @xmath17  yrs the two populations will always appear to evolve independently .",
    "we have shown here that the ( unnormalized ) cluster age distribution in the smc has the form @xmath0 and that overall the field star age distribution is nearly flat ( i.e. , @xmath49 , over the age range @xmath37  yr ) .",
    "normalized _ smc cluster age distribution ( the number of clusters divided by the number of individual stars of the same age ) therefore must have the same form as the unnormalized distribution [ i.e. , @xmath50 . our conclusion contradicts that of rz05 , who found that the normalized cluster age distribution is @xmath51 from the same data .",
    "the difference in the power - law exponent between our work and that of rz05 comes about because we divided the cluster age distribution ( @xmath3 ) directly by that for the field stars ( @xmath4 ) , whereas rz05 divided @xmath52 by @xmath53 , and then appear to have introduced an extraneous factor of @xmath13 .",
    "our result that the age distribution of smc clusters has a power - law form @xmath0 has important implications regarding the physical processes that disrupt star clusters .",
    "the fact that clusters in vastly different environments ( including the chaotic merging of two galaxies , a quiescent spiral disk , and a gas - rich dwarf galaxy ) have age distributions with nearly identical forms provides strong evidence that star clusters disrupt rapidly due to processes _ internal _ to the clusters themselves . over the first few million years photoionization , stellar winds , jets and supernovae can remove much of the interstellar matter from clusters leaving the member stars freely expanding ( e.g. , hills 1980 ; boily & kroupa 2003a , b ) .",
    "these expanding clusters will be observable for @xmath5  few  @xmath54  yrs after becoming unbound , until their surface brightness becomes so low that they become indistinguishable from statistical fluctuations of stars in the field ( fcw05 ) .",
    "in addition to the removal of interstellar material , mass loss from stars themselves will likely contribute to the continued unbinding of clusters ( e.g. , applegate 1986 ; chernoff & weinberg 1990 ; fukushige & heggie 1995 ) .",
    "finally , two - body evaporation will destroy any remaining clusters on longer timescales ( e.g. , vesperini 1997 ; baumgardt 1998 ; fall & zhang 2001 ) .",
    "the early disruption ( `` infant mortality '' ) appears to operate relatively independent of cluster mass , while two - body evaporation is mass - dependent .",
    "the stars from disrupted clusters add to the general field , requiring a close relationship between the age distributions of clusters and field stars if most stars form initially in clusters . in this work we compared age distributions for clusters and individual stars in the smc with model predictions to further test this general framework .",
    "our models suggest that the rapid drop in the cluster age distribution should be reflected in a rapid rise in the field star age distribution .",
    "however this rapid rise in the number of field stars is only observable for the first @xmath17  yrs _ regardless of the fraction of stars that initially formed in clusters_. because the present data on smc stars begin just as the predicted field star distributions flatten , and because there is no discrimination between stars belonging to clusters versus to the field , they do not provide an unambiguous answer .",
    "however the observed relations are consistent with a scenario where most stars form in clusters that are subsequently disrupted by the mechanisms discussed above .",
    "the models also predict that even if all stars form initially in clusters , galaxies will contain a relatively small number of observable clusters at any given time .",
    "future studies with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( which allow better discrimination between stars in clusters and in the general field ) , and in the infrared ( which can probe very young , deeply embedded stars and clusters ) could be used to search for the expected rise in the field star age distribution at @xmath35  yrs . a measurement of the rise in @xmath4 would provide a direct estimate of the fraction of stars which originally form in clusters versus in the field .",
