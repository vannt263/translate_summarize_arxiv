    "there has been recently active interest in tests of quantum mechanics@xcite versus local realism in a high efficiency detection limit .",
    "several authors@xcite including ourselves have considered detection schemes quadrature phase homodyne measurements .",
    "such schemes use strong local oscillators and hence have very high detection efficiency@xcite .",
    "this removes one of the current loopholes@xcite and potentially allows a strong test of quantum mechanics@xcite to be performed .",
    "the original idea of gilchrist _ et .",
    "al._@xcite was to use a _ circle _ or pair coherent state@xcite produced by nondegenerate parametric oscillation with the pump mode adiabatically eliminated .",
    "using highly efficient quadrature phase homodyne measurements , the clauser horne strong bell inequality@xcite could be tested in an all optical regime .",
    "a small ( approximately @xmath0 ) but significant theoretical violation was found for this extremely idea system .",
    "while the mean photon number for the system may be low ( approximately @xmath1 ) , the use of homodyne measurements allow a macroscopic current to be detected .    in this article ,",
    "we take an unphysical but interesting approach and answer the following questions :    * _ given that your detection scheme is a quadrature phase homodyne measurement , what is the optimal input or correlated photon number state to maximize the potential violation ? _ * _ what is the optimal bell inequality to test ?",
    "_    to begin we will restrict our attention to correlated photon number states of the form @xmath2 .",
    "the most well known is simply the nondegenerate parametric amplifier specified by an ideal hamiltonian of the form@xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is field amplitude of a nondepleting classical pump and @xmath5 is proportional to the susceptibility of the medium .",
    "@xmath6 are the boson operators for the orthogonal signal and idler modes . after a time @xmath7",
    ", the state of the system is given by ( [ correlatedpair ] ) with @xmath8 specified by @xmath9}\\over{\\cosh \\left[\\chi \\epsilon \\tau\\right ] } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the quadrature phase amplitude basis this state has a positive wigner function .",
    "hence it can be described as a local hidden variable theory and thus can not violate a bell inequality .",
    "the other source of highly correlated photon number states exists in nondegenerate parametric oscillation . in the limit of very large parametric nonlinearity and high q cavities , a state of the form@xcite @xmath10",
    "can be generated .",
    "here @xmath11 is the size of the circle of the coherent states and @xmath12 is the zeroth order modified bessel function .",
    "equivalently this state can be written in the form of ( [ correlatedpair ] ) with @xmath8 given by @xmath13 this was the state considered by gilchrist _ et .",
    "al._@xcite    given the general form of known correlated number states ( [ correlatedpair ] ) , the next fundamental question that should be initially addressed is what we mean by the bell inequality .",
    "a number of bell inequalities exist , and the particular one depends used heavy on your application and experimental setup .",
    "the bell inequalities to be considered in this article are the clauser horne@xcite , the _ spin_@xcite , and the information - theoretic@xcite bell inequality . a detailed derivation of the various inequalities will not be given , the reader is referred to references @xcite . here",
    "we will consider only strong inequalities , that is inequalities where auxiliary assumptions ( not based on local realism ) are not required .",
    "in fig ( [ fig1 ] ) we depict a very idealized setup for general bell inequality experiment .",
    "probably the most well known inequality is the clauser horne strong bell inequality@xcite given by @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the probability that a `` 1 '' results occurs at each analyzer @xmath16 given @xmath17 .",
    "similarly @xmath18 is the probability that a `` 1 '' occurs at a detector while having no information about the second . for many of the actual experimental considerations",
    "an angle factorization occurs so that @xmath19 depends only on @xmath20 .",
    "also @xmath21 and @xmath22 are independent of @xmath17 . in this case",
    "@xmath23 can be simplified to @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the second form of the bell inequality ( sometimes referred to as the _ spin _ or original bell inequality ) is@xcite @xmath27 where the correlation function @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 here as discussed above @xmath15 is probability that a `` 1 '' results occurs at each analyzer @xmath16 given @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath30 is probability that a `` 0 '' results occurs at each analyzer @xmath16 , while @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) is probability that a `` 1 '' ( `` 0 '' ) results occurs at the analyzer @xmath33 and a `` 0 '' ( `` 1 '' ) at @xmath34 . with the angle factorization",
    "given above , the inequality ( [ spin ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath35    our final form of bell inequality to be considered in this article was developed by braunstein and caves@xcite .",
    "this classical information - theoretic bell inequality has the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 here @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 with @xmath40 being the information gained at @xmath34 given the result at @xmath33 is known .",
    "the conditional information is then given by @xmath38 .",
    "the base of the logarithm determines the units of the information ( base 2 for bits , base e for nats ) . for quantum computing purposes ,",
    "this inequality should prove highly useful as it directly deals with information content .",
    "several other bell inequality do exist such as the chsh inequality@xcite , but these are not considered here due to there weaker nature .",
    "auxiliary assumptions are necessary in there derivation which open up several loopholes@xcite .",
    "from ( [ correlatedpair ] ) we need to find the optimal @xmath8 which gives the largest bell inequality violation . before determining the @xmath8 we need to briefly focus our attention on the quadrature phase homodyne measurement .",
    "a quadrature phase - amplitude homodyne measurement @xmath41 at @xmath33 can achieved by combining a signal field ( say @xmath42 ) with a strong local oscillator field ( say @xmath4 ) to form two new fields given by @xmath43 /\\sqrt{2}$ ] . here",
    "@xmath44 is a phase shift which allows the choice of particular observable to be measured , for instance choosing @xmath44 as @xmath45 or @xmath46 allows the measurement of the conjugate phase variables @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively .",
    "the homodyne measurement gives the photocurrent difference as @xmath49 performing a measurement on the quadrature phase amplitude @xmath41 at @xmath33 yields a result @xmath50 which ranges in size and sign .",
    "similarly a measurement on the quadrature phase amplitude @xmath51 at @xmath34 yields a result @xmath52 . for our state given by ( [ correlatedpair ] ) , the probability of obtaining the result @xmath53 is simply @xmath54 where @xmath55 here @xmath56 is the hermite polynomial and @xmath57 is the phase of the local oscillator .",
    "eqn ( [ prob ] ) can be explicitly written as @xmath58 where @xmath59 , that is our expression depends only on the sum of the individual local angles .",
    "the probability given by ( [ prob1 ] ) is for continuous variables .",
    "the majority of the tests of quantum mechanics versus local realism require a binary result .",
    "hence for a given quadrature measurement @xmath60 we classify the result as `` 1 '' if @xmath61 and the mutually exclusive `` 0 '' if @xmath62 . here",
    "we have set the binning window about @xmath63 .",
    "where this binning window is located is quite arbitrary , but the maximum violation occurs for the value we have selected .",
    "the probability of obtaining both particles in the `` 1 '' bin is @xmath64 while the probability of obtaining both particles in the `` 0 '' bin is @xmath65 the other probabilities such @xmath66 can be calculated in a similar fashion .",
    "the probabilities formulated above are joint probabilities .",
    "various of the strong bell inequalities also require marginal probabilities of the form @xmath67    the above integrals can be easy evaluated using the results@xcite @xmath68 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\;&\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;(for\\;n\\neq m ) \\nonumber\\\\ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}e^{-x^{2 } } h_{n}(x ) h_{m}(x)&= & 2^{n}n !",
    "\\sqrt{\\pi } \\delta_{n , m } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 with @xmath71 being the gamma function .",
    "performing the integrals for ( [ prob11 ] ) and ( [ prob00 ] ) we find @xmath72^{2}\\cos \\left[(n - m )    \\psi\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similarly eqn ( [ marprob ] ) simplifies to @xmath73 which is independent of the sum of the local oscillator angle @xmath74 .",
    "it is also simple to calculate the correlation function @xmath75 @xmath76^{2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\;&\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\times \\cos \\left[(n - m ) \\psi\\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    given the probabilities @xmath15 , @xmath30 , @xmath77 it is also possible to calculate the conditional information @xmath38 @xmath78-p_{00 } \\log   \\left[2 p_{00 } \\right]\\nonumber \\\\ & -&p_{10 } \\log \\left[2 p_{10 } \\right]-p_{01 } \\log \\left[2 p_{01 } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is now possible to calculate the clauser horne ( [ ch ] ) and spin ( [ spin ] ) and information - theoretic ( [ info ] ) bell inequalities .",
    "some insight into the problem can be achieved by a careful examination of the term @xmath79^{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is present in all the joint probability distributions .",
    "this expression has several interesting features .",
    "first , as the difference between @xmath80 and @xmath81 becomes large , the smaller that the above expression contributes to any of the probability distributions .",
    "the main contribution for the expression comes from the case @xmath82 .",
    "second , when @xmath83 is even , the above expression is zero . finally , as @xmath80 is large the different between the @xmath84 and @xmath85 elements for fixed large @xmath80 vanishes and they reach an asymptotic limit which is smaller than the @xmath86 case .",
    "if these higher order @xmath80 terms dominate due to the choice of the @xmath8 in the probability formula , then the various bell inequalities can not violated .",
    "this also has the implication that the mean photon number can not be high if a violation is to occur and hence it is not a macroscopic test of quantum mechanics .",
    "to begin our investigations of the bell inequalities , consider the case of we have only two photon pair states that is , latexmath:[\\ ] ] the informational theoretic bell inequality is given by @xmath98 .",
    "a violation of this inequality is possible if @xmath99 .",
    "unfortunately for all @xmath100 and",
    "@xmath74 we have @xmath101 .",
    "no violation is possible for any of the bell inequalities considered for the ideal state ( [ idealsimple ] ) when the detection scheme is based on homodyne quadrature phase measurements . if more correlated photon pairs are present can a violation be achieved ?",
    "the obvious answer is yes , because of the recent work of gilchrist _ et .",
    "the real question is how large this violation is ?",
    "considering the expression ( [ correlatedpair ] ) for the correlated photon pairs , what are the optimal @xmath8 coefficients to maximize the violation . because of the results indicated by gilchrist _ et .",
    "al . _ and our previous discussion",
    "we anticipate that the mean photon number per mode must be low to obtain a violation .",
    "hence we will truncate the number state basis at @xmath102@xcite photon per mode . performing a numerical optimization over all the @xmath8",
    ", the optimal set is found to maximize the clauser horne and spin bell inequality ( table [ newtable1 ] ) .",
    "a plot of @xmath8 versus @xmath80 is depicted in fig ( [ fig2 ] )    it is interesting to now discuss some properties of these optimal @xmath8 .",
    "first the general shape of the @xmath8 versus @xmath80 curve shown in ( [ fig2 ] ) is similar to that considered in the circle state by gilchrist _ et .",
    "al._@xcite . it is however not exactly the same ( see ( table [ newtable1 ] ) . given this optimal parameter set , what is the maximum violation of the bell inequalities we are considering . in fig ( [ fig3 ] ) we plot both the clauser horne and spin bell inequalities versus @xmath74 .",
    "for the clauser horne bell inequality the maximum violation corresponds to @xmath103 , while the maximum violation for the spin bell inequality corresponds to @xmath104 .",
    "interesting here is that the percentage violation of the spin inequality is approximately @xmath105 compared with the @xmath106 for the clauser horne case .",
    "this significantly increases the potential for an experiment to be performed provided such an experiment were not significantly more difficult .",
    "also the results for the optimal @xmath8 set give a clauser horne bell inequality violation that is approximately @xmath107 greater than the circle state results of gilchrist _ et . al._@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to consider whether a greater violation of the bell inequality can be achieved with the state given by ( [ circlecn ] ) . to this end",
    "we show the effect of the variation of both @xmath11 and @xmath74 ( sum of the local oscillator angles ) for both the clauser horne and spin bell inequalities in fig ( [ fig4 ] ) . as can be seen the spin bell inequality can be violated far more significantly than the similar clauser horne case .",
    "in fact , as occurred previously the percentage maximum violation in the spin inequality is twice that of the clauser horne result .",
    "in any of the analysis considered above we have not discussed errors , there sources and how they effect the potential violation .",
    "we will not present any significant details here in this article but refer the reader to @xcite for such a decision .    our final bell inequality to be considered",
    "is the braunstein and caves@xcite information - theoretic case . in fig ( [ fig5 ] ) we plot @xmath108 versus @xmath74 .",
    "no violation of the information - theoretic inequality is possible for any @xmath74 .",
    "a question here to be addressed is why two of the strong inequalities can be violated while this information - theoretic bell inequality is far from being violated . in the binning process to give a binary result for a quadrature measurement , information must be discarded .",
    "the information - theoretic inequality is much more sensitive to this information loss than the clauser horne inequality .",
    "also why would we fundamentally expect all three inequalities to be violated",
    ". a violation of any of the inequalities indicate a discrepancy between quantum mechanics and local realism .",
    "in this article we have place strict bounds on the optimal @xmath8 coefficients for the state ( [ correlatedpair ] ) which maximizes the clauser horne and spin bell inequalities when a homodyne quadrature phase measurements is performed .",
    "the spin bell inequality is violated by approximately @xmath109 while the clauser horne inequality is violated by approximately @xmath110 .",
    "the violation is small however due to the fact that we are discarding information in the binning process .",
    "in fact due to the information loss in the binning process the information theoretic bell inequality is not violated in any regime .",
    "a larger violation can not be obtained using homodyne measurements with the strong inequalities we have considered .",
    "while our optimal @xmath8 coefficient give a slightly better violation than the pair coherent state , it is difficult to see how such a state could be generated . closely examining the spin bell inequality with the pair coherent state still indicates that a greater violation ( approximately twice the size ) is possible than for the other inequalities",
    "this would make the test much more feasible provided the pair coherent state could be generated .",
    "in such a system the mean photon number is small , so this is not strictly a macroscopic test of quantum mechanics .",
    "it does however have a macroscopic nature due the strong local oscillator which means large photodetector currents are obtained .    to conclude , quadrature phase homodyne measurement provide a mechanism for performing tests of the bell inequality with highly efficient detection .",
    "this allows one of the loopholes in current experiments to be closed .",
    "however , due to the inherent information loss in the binning process , the violations are small but should be achievable .",
