    "the possibility of extra spatial dimensions  @xcite , hidden from our current experiments and observations through compactification or warping , has opened up a wealth of options for particle physics model building and allowed entirely new approaches for addressing cosmological problems .    in many models ,",
    "standard model fields are supposed to be confined to a submanifold , or brane , while in other models they populate the entire bulk .",
    "common to both approaches , however , is the inclusion of bulk fields beyond pure gravity , either because they are demanded by a more complete theory , such as string theory , or because they are necessary to stabilize the extra dimensional manifold .",
    "thus , a complete understanding of the predictions and allowed phenomenology of extra dimension models necessarily includes a comprehensive consideration of the configurations of these fields .",
    "the allowed configurations of such bulk fields are determined , naturally , by their equations of motion , subject to the boundary conditions imposed by the particular extra - dimensional model under consideration",

    "these configurations exist whenever the potential possesses at least two degenerate minima and we show that they may form a finite tower of kink state solutions . we explicitly demonstrate that all but the lowest - lying of these - the ones with no nodes in the interval - are unstable .",
    "in addition we identify a general stability criterion for these lowest - lying states , and provide concrete examples for specific convenient choices of potential .    that a finite tower of nontrivial static configurations may exist , with the possibility of multiple stable ones , allows for new phenomena and constraints on the models , and may have wide - ranging implications for the particle physics and cosmological theories constructed around them  @xcite .",
    "we are currently considering the effects of including gravitational effects on the configurations explored in this paper .",

    "there will be a minimum value of @xmath18 for which nontrivial solutions exist , and the period @xmath34 will diverge at that value .",
    "note also that , if we allow @xmath18 to approach the value of @xmath53 at a different local maximum , the period @xmath34 once again diverges .",

    "however , the crucial difference here is that the second derivative of @xmath173 vanishes at two additional field values .",
    "this is enough to allow , for a certain range of choices of @xmath8 , the existence of multiple nodeless solutions , illustrated by the points @xmath174 , @xmath175 and @xmath176 on the middle plot of figure  [ example2plot ] .",
    "our stability criterion then allows us to immediately conclude that the solutions @xmath174 and @xmath176 are stable , while solution @xmath175 is unstable .",
    "these stable solutions are shown in figure  [ qssolutionsex2 ] .",
    "the bottom plot of figure  [ example2plot ] represents the energy of solutions as a function of amplitude and shows that the allowed nodeless solution with higher amplitude ( @xmath176 in this case ) has the lower energy .      before concluding , let us provide a more complicated example v_3()=-^2 -5 ^ 4+^6 -^8+^10  , [ thirdexample ] in which we have set all dimensionful parameters to unity .",
    "this potential possesses a pair of degenerate local minima at @xmath177 and a distinct pair of degenerate global minima at @xmath178 .    in this case",
    "there are two separate intervals of the amplitude @xmath18 for which there exist nontrivial solutions , as seen in figure  [ example3plot ] . with the choice @xmath179",
    ", the middle plot shows that there are 4 nodeless solutions @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath36 and @xmath182 .",
    "only two of them , @xmath181 and @xmath182 , shown in figure  [ qssolutionsex3 ] , will be stable according to our stability condition and we find that the larger amplitude solution @xmath182 has the lower energy .",
    "a thorough understanding of the implications of extra dimensional models requires us to investigate not only perturbative phenomena , but also the allowed distinct background configurations of brane and bulk fields . in infinite dimensions , it is well - known that scalar fields with vacuum manifolds with particular topological properties can give rise to topologically distinct sectors of the theory , characterized by the soliton number . in a compact dimension ,",
    "the situation is more subtle , since the boundary conditions can affect the stability of configurations identified in the infinite size limit .",
    "+ in this paper we have studied static , background configurations of scalar fields in constructions in which the bulk space is an @xmath0 orbifold - an interval with reflection - symmetric boundary conditions .",
    "we have performed a general stability analysis of such configurations , demonstrating that all solutions with nodes in the interval are unstable .",
    "we have also derived a powerful general criterion with which to determine the conditions under which nodeless solutions are stable .",
    "+ in many cases , there are multiple nodeless solutions , in which case we need to determine which one is the vacuum state of the theory by computing its associated energy density .",
    "+ the application of these results to model building and problem solving in extra dimension models may have novel and interesting implications for particle physics , cosmology and the details of stabilization methods .",
    "to fully understand such effects will require the inclusion of both quantum effects and gravity , a task that is underway .",
