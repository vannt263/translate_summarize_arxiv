    "it has long been speculated that the vast energy of supernova remnants ( snrs ) is tapped to produce the bulk of galactic cosmic rays .",
    "those snrs interacting with molecular clouds are excellent targets to detect evidence of cosmic ray acceleration .",
    "the nearby dense gas acts as a target for hadronic cosmic rays , producing @xmath0-rays via the decay of neutral pions ( e.g. , drury et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "interest in cosmic rays from interacting snrs has been reinvigorated by recent detections of @xmath0-ray emission at gev- to multi - tev - energies from supernova remnants .",
    "the hess galactic plane survey yielded 14 new tev detections , 7 of which are coincident with snrs @xcite .",
    "targeted observations are now capable of reaching sufficient sensitivities to resolve the morphology of @xmath0-ray emission associated with the remnant @xcite .",
    "in particular , a tev - energy counterpart to ic 443 was observed to be spatially offset from the gev - energy @xmath0-ray source @xcite .",
    "the spatial variations with energy may indicate the diffusion of cosmic rays accelerated by the supernova remnant out into the adjacent molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "interacting snrs represent a promising class of @xmath0-ray sources which are likely to be uncovered in increasing numbers by the current generation of @xmath0-ray observatories .",
    "however , to date the identification of @xmath0-ray counterparts to snrs has been inhibited by the poor spatial resolution and sensitivity of @xmath0-ray telescopes @xcite .",
    "often , the association of @xmath0-ray sources with interacting snrs rests on supplemental evidence from common tracers of interaction with dense gas : broad molecular lines , bright at infrared to millimeter wavelengths ( e.g. , reach et al .",
    "2005 ) , and the hydroxyl(oh ) maser at 1720 mhz ( e.g. , frail et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "oh masers , when detected only at 1720 mhz , are a particularly powerful diagnostic which is only associated with snr shocks . while these `` snr masers '' are only detected in @xmath110% of remnants , they unambiguously trace cool ( 25150 k ) , dense ( @xmath110@xmath2 @xmath3 ) gas in the wake of non - dissociative shocks and permit a direct measure of magnetic field strength @xcite .",
    "prominent interacting snrs w28 , w44 and ic 443 have been noted for both bright masers and coincident egret sources , leading to the suggestion that masers may trace cosmic - ray acceleration sites @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we address the nature of interacting snrs with @xmath0-ray counterparts : first , we show that an excellent correlation exists between snr masers and a subset of gev- and tev - energy sources toward snrs .",
    "this strengthens the argument for a hadronic origin for the observed @xmath0-rays .",
    "second , if pion decay is indeed the dominant emission mechanism , the implied cosmic ray enhancement is sufficient to explain the increased ionization needed to produce high columns of oh in the post - shock gas @xcite .",
    "this suggests there is a more intimate relationship between snr masers and @xmath0-ray sources than merely being complimentary tracers of dense gas interaction .",

    "the source 3eg j1410 - 6147 , coincident with snr g312.4 - 0.4 , has recently been associated with the young pulsar j1410 - 6132 with variability detected by agile @xcite .",

    "we include all remnants for which an association with the coincident @xmath0-ray source has not been ruled out .",

    "of the 12 identified snrs which are interacting with dense gas , all but two ( msh 11 - 61a and w49b ) have detected snr masers .",
    "the presence of masers gives several advantages : ( 1 ) masers signpost interaction with dense ( 10@xmath2 @xmath3 ) clouds , which will enhance the pion decay signature , ( 2 ) the velocity of the maser gives a kinematic distance , and ( 3 ) an established velocity allows the adjacent cloud to be isolated from confusing galactic emission along the line of sight",

    "here we include all remnants which have been searched for snr masers @xcite and those @xmath0-ray sources which have not been clearly identified as having a non - snr origin .",

    "three rows are given for snrs with masers present , absent or not surveyed .",
    "two columns divide snrs with and without coincident @xmath0-ray detections .",
    "each of the two columns lists the `` number '' of snrs which meet both classifications , the number `` expected from counts '' assuming the maser and @xmath0-ray properties of remnants are completely independent , and `` contribution to @xmath9 '' which gives the @xmath9 , ( observed  expected)@xmath10/(expected ) . for this test the total @xmath9 is 31 with two degrees of freedom .",
    "this gives a probability of @xmath110.0001@xmath8 that snr masers and @xmath0-ray counterparts to snrs are not correlated .",
    "we note that two of the expected cell frequencies are less than five .",
    "to be statistically rigorous we also apply the fisher exact probability test in addition to the @xmath9 test .",
    "the fisher test considers all possible outcomes of the contingency table in order to determine the probability of finding a correlation at least as strong as is observed . here",
    "again we find a clear rejection of independence between @xmath0-ray and maser detections in snrs , with a probability of 0.002@xmath8 .",
    "the two classes are clearly associated .",
    "a similar contingency table analysis was used to quantify an association between snr masers and mixed - morphology remnants , a class of snrs with shell - type radio morphologies with prominent thermal x - ray emission from their interiors @xcite .",
    "both classes of remnants are thought to result from interaction with dense gas and are strongly correlated . of the identified @xmath0-ray snrs , 9 are classified as both mixed - morphology and maser - emitting , 2 are mixed - morphology without detected masers ( snrs w49b and msh 11 - 61a ) , and only snr g5.7 - 0.0 has detected masers but no x - ray detection .",
    "therefore , either classification produces a nearly identically good correlation with @xmath0-ray snrs .",
    "both x - rays and cosmic rays are capable of providing the ionization needed to produce snr masers .",
    "detailed discussion is given in section [ sec : ionization ] .",
    "an additional complication arises in that many snrs have associated pulsars with their own wind nebulae that are also capable of accelerating particles to tev energies . to account for this",
    "we separate the @xmath0-ray snrs into two categories based on whether a pwn is or is not also detected .",
    "this reduces the number of sources that fall under each classification , lowering the probability of independence from the fisher test to 1.2@xmath8 , still significant enough to reject the null hypothesis .",
    "furthermore , there is evidence that at least four snrs ( see table [ tbl : list ] , `` group a '' ) are associated with @xmath0-ray emission from the snr - cloud interaction , and not the pwn .",
    "improved spatial resolution is needed to discriminate between @xmath0-ray emission from the pwn and snr , but we note that there are no markedly different characteristics between the two groups of snrs with and without pwn .      for snrs interacting with dense gas ,",
    "@xmath0-ray counterparts are likely to be dominated by emission from neutral pion decay originating from interactions between hadronic cosmic rays and gas nuclei .",
    "in contrast to young snrs , older interacting snrs have little if any detected x - ray synchrotron emission .",
    "an inverse - compton scenario requires small magnetic field strengths @xmath111 @xmath12 g @xcite whereas zeeman splitting of snr masers measures field strengths of order @xmath11 mg @xcite",
    ". electronic bremsstrahlung emission has also been proposed , but the expectation would be for @xmath0-ray emission to trace the radio shell morphology @xcite .",
    "tev emission from w28 and ic 443 shows no correlation with the radio shell , and an excellent correlation with dense gas @xcite .",
    "forthcoming fermi observations will have sufficient resolution to resolve this question at gev energies .",
    "the presence of a large reservoir of dense gas around the snr , the expectation that cosmic rays are accelerated by snrs , and the relatively older ages of this subset of interacting snrs supports a pion decay origin for @xmath0-ray counterparts .",
    "the morphology of @xmath0-ray emission is seen to be well matched to that of the molecular cloud . in figure",
    "[ fig : histo ] , histograms of @xmath0-ray luminosity show medians of 1.7@xmath1310@xmath14 ergs s@xmath15 and 1.5@xmath1310@xmath16 ergs s@xmath15 for gev and tev detections , respectively .",
    "this is consistent with luminosity estimates if a significant fraction of the sn energy ( 10 - 20% ) is diverted to cosmic - rays which are incident on the adjacent molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "the orders of magnitude differences in the luminosity reflect the expected energy spectrum of accelerated particles .    on average a hardening of the photon spectrum from gev to tev energies is also observed .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectral index , given in columns 7 and 9 of table [ tbl : list ] , steepen at higher energies from a mean of @xmath17 2.1 to @xmath18 2.6 .",
    "it has been suggested for nearby snr ic 443 that this spectral steepening results either from the presence of both pion decay and a strong bremsstrahlung component @xcite , or the diffusion of cosmic rays at different energies through the dense cloud @xcite .",
    "in addition to ic 443 , the snrs w28 , sgr a east , and g359.1 - 0.5 show this characteristic spectral hardening at higher energies , but ctb 37a does not .",
