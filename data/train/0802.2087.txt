    "_ ` stratification is a common technique , ' _ often necessary , but also attractive because it _ ` may produce a gain in precision in the estimates of characteristics of the whole population ' _ ( cochran ( 1963 ) ,  5.1 ) .",
    "in fact , if all sampling is done with replacement and the sample sizes are proportional to the strata sizes , stratified random sampling is at least as precise as simple random sampling .",
    "it even approaches perfection as the homogeneity inside the strata increases , i.e. , as the heterogeneity of the population is more reflected by the heterogeneity between the strata and less by the heterogeneity inside the strata .",
    "consequently , the rule of thumb with respect to stratified sampling is that it does nt hurt to try .    in real life , however , sampling is _ without _ replacement ( cf . cochran ( 1963 ) ,  2.1 : _ ` sampling with replacement is entirely feasible but except in special circumstances is seldom used , since there seems little point in having the same unit twice in the sample'_)and without replacement , the rule of thumb is no longer valid .",
    "even optimal stratified sampling may hurt then , in that the corresponding estimator can have a larger variance than the estimator based on a simple random sample ( cf .",

    "the intuition might be helped here by realizing that , as equalities ( [ truth ] ) below remind us , _ not _ replacing yields an advantage that is zero for a sample size of  1 and increases with the sample size .",
    "thus , the advantage is larger for one sample of size @xmath0 than for  @xmath1 samples of size  1 ; cf .",

    "we only consider the simplest possible case , that of a dichotomous population . for this case ,",
    "the results in armitage ( 1947 ) , cochran ( 1963 ) , and evans ( 1951 ) are extended to what looks like a quite complete picture .",
    "the simple - is - better effect shows up in more circumstances than previously thought and is provided with exact bounds for its size .",

    "we want to estimate  @xmath6 .",
    "one approach is to take a sample of @xmath1 balls from the urn and estimate  @xmath6 by the fraction of the red balls in the sample .",
    "a sample of @xmath1 balls _ with replacement _ is a random member @xmath7 of @xmath8 , where all outcomes are equally likely ; a sample of @xmath1 balls _ without replacement _ is the same , except that the @xmath9 are all different .",
    "let  @xmath10 and  @xmath11 denote the number of red balls in a sample of size  @xmath1 with and without replacement , respectively .",
    "then for the fraction estimators @xmath12 and @xmath13 for  @xmath6 the truth of @xmath14 is well known ; it is better never to see the same ball twice .",
    "the stratification estimator with replacement the stratification estimator without replacement the simple estimator with replacement now suppose the urn consists of @xmath15 disjoint sub - urns , _ strata _ , each stratum@xmath16 containing  @xmath17 balls , @xmath18 , and that for each stratum@xmath16 we know @xmath19 but not its fraction  @xmath20 of red balls .",
    "let @xmath21 be an _ allocation _",
    ", i.e. , the  @xmath22 are natural numbers with @xmath23 for all  @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and let @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , denote the number of red balls in a sample of size  @xmath22 from stratum@xmath29 with and without replacement , respectively ; then each of @xmath30 is an unbiased estimator for  @xmath6 ; for their optimality , cf .",

    "both with and without replacement we want to compare the variance of the simple estimator to that of the stratification estimator , i.e. , @xmath31 to @xmath32 and @xmath33 to @xmath34 , under the assumption that the  @xmath26 are independent as well as the  @xmath27 .",
    "it is immediate that if the strata are homogeneous but the whole population is not , i.e. , @xmath35 and each @xmath20 is equal to  0 or  1 , then the stratification estimators are perfect while , with replacement , the simple estimator is not , and , without replacement , the simple estimator is only perfect when it is exhaustive , so that @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    for arbitrary @xmath20 ,",
    "the stratification estimator @xmath38 is still not worse than the simple estimator @xmath12 as long as the allocation is _ proportional _ , i.e. , @xmath39 for every  @xmath24 , because in that case @xmath40 holds , as one easily verifies .",
    "thus , if all sampling is with replacement and the allocation is proportional , then stratified sampling is seen to reduce the variance , unless all the  @xmath20 are equal .",
    "and where it does nt help , it does nt harm either .",
    "however , this reassurance no longer holds as soon as we change the allocation :    [ withnotprop ] if @xmath41 and the allocation is _ not _ proportional , then simple is better in that @xmath42 i.e. , the variance of is greater than the variance of .    nor",
    "does it hold if all samples are drawn _ without _ replacement :    [ withoutreplwithoutmalus ] if @xmath41 and @xmath43 , then simple is better in that @xmath44 i.e. , the variance of is greater than the variance of .",
    "this is ( vi_b _ ) in armitage ( 1947 ) for a dichotomous population , i.e. , for the case where armitage s ` variable  @xmath45 ' has only 2 different values , except that we do not need his condition that ( in the dichotomous case ) all the  @xmath46 are equal .",
    "it is also the dichotomous case of what is proved at the end of  5.6 in cochran ( 1963 ) , except that our condition @xmath47 is replaced by the condition that all the ` mean square [ errors ] within strata ' @xmath48 are equal and larger than the ` mean square [ error ] among strata ' @xmath49 . in hjek ( 1981 ) , the observation after ( 20.31 ) that simple is better if @xmath47 only refers to proportional allocation , not necessarily to all allocations . under additional conditions inequality ( [ thm2 ] ) may be sharpened :    [ withoutreplwithmalus ] let @xmath50 if @xmath41 , @xmath43 , and    ( c1 ) @xmath51 for @xmath52 , or    ( c2 ) the allocation is proportional , or    ( c3 ) @xmath53 ,    then @xmath54 i.e. , the variance of is at least @xmath55 the variance of , and @xmath56    theorem [ withoutreplwithmalus](c3 ) follows from evans ( 1951 ) ( 12_a , c _ )",
    ".    a special case will illustrate theorem  [ withoutreplwithmalus ] and bring out a weak point of the stratification estimator ; the factor @xmath57 in  @xmath58 appearing here was met in ( 1 ) ( take @xmath59 ) .",
    "imagine that all strata not only have the same composition , i.e. , @xmath47 , but also the same size , i.e. , @xmath60 , and that from each stratum only one ball is taken , so @xmath61 and @xmath59 .",
    "then @xmath62 , which is distributed as  @xmath12 , so that with ( [ well ] ) @xmath63 splitting the sample over the strata reduces the without - replacement bonus from ( [ well ] ) .    the need for extra conditions in theorem  [ withoutreplwithmalus ] such as ( c1 ) , ( c2 ) , or ( c3 ) , and the room there is for theorem  [ withoutreplwithoutmalus ] are demonstrated by considering @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "further , one may ask if the condition ` @xmath67 ' is only the beginning : are there other distributions of the red balls among the strata , for which there are theorems similar to theorem  [ withoutreplwithmalus ] but with lower bounds that are even higher than  @xmath58 in theorem  [ withoutreplwithmalus ] ?",

    "_    theorem  [ minimax ] shows that if we want to curb the badness of stratified sampling and proportional allocation is an option , then it works , at least for strata of the same size .",
    "this makes us realize that it _ always _ works , even for _ arbitrary _ strata sizes , because independence , ( [ truth ] ) , and ( [ propwithrepl ] ) imply @xmath77 under proportional allocation .",
