    "i will remember gteborg as a clean and ordered town .",
    "inpc 2004 was certainly well organized .",
    "my talk , too , was about organization .",
    "nuclear structure involves energies that are much smaller than the typical qcd mass scale , @xmath0 gev .",
    "this is a common situation in physics : an `` underlying '' theory is valid at a mass scale @xmath1 , but we want to study processes at momenta @xmath2 of the order of a lower scale @xmath3 .",
    "typically , there is `` more '' at lower energies . how to organize the complexity brought in by the `` effective '' interactions that will ensure that low - energy observables are described correctly ?",
    "effective field theory ( eft ) is a framework to construct these interactions systematically , at the same time maintaining desirable general principles such as causality and cluster decomposition . here",
    "i discuss the application of eft to a class of nuclear systems : those that exhibit poles in the complex momentum plane at a scale much smaller than the pion mass , that is , @xmath4 .",
    "they include two- and three - nucleon systems , and other halo nuclei .",
    "eft starts with the observation that the effective interactions consist of the sum of _ all _ possible interaction terms in a lagrangian that involves only the fields representing low - energy degrees of freedom .",
    "because of the uncertainty principle , each of these interaction terms can be taken as a local combination of derivatives of the fields .",
    "if the `` integrating out '' of the high - energy degrees of freedom is done appropriately , the effective lagrangian will have the same symmetries as the underlying theory .",
    "the details of the underlying dynamics , on the other hand , are contained in the interaction strengths .",
    "the latter depend also on the details of how the low- and high - energy degrees of freedom are separated .",
    "this separation requires the introduction of a cutoff parameter @xmath5 with dimensions of energy .",
    "both the interaction strengths and the quantum effects represented by loops depend on @xmath5 . however , the cutoff procedure is arbitrary , so by construction observables are independent of @xmath5 ( `` renormalization - group invariance '' ) .",
    "the @xmath6 matrix for any low - energy process acquires the schematic form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a common normalization factor , @xmath9 is a counting index starting at some value @xmath10 , the @xmath11 s are parameters , and the @xmath12 s are calculable functions .",
    "we must have @xmath13    in order to maintain predictive power in the effective theory it is necessary to truncate the sum in eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) in such a way that the resulting cutoff dependence can be decreased systematically with increasing order .",
    "we call such ordering `` power counting '' .",
    "there are essentially two ways of doing this .",
    "one is to carry out the integration of high - energy degrees of freedom explicitly as it is done in going from qcd to the effective hadronic theory through lattice simulations and infer the power counting from the sizes of the calculated terms .",
    "another , which we use when we do not know or can not solve the underlying theory , is to guess the sizes of the effective interactions by assuming that the renormalized interactions are natural , that is , are in order of magnitude given by @xmath14 to a power determined by dimensional analysis .",
    "this guess is confirmed _ a posteriori _ , by checking renormalization - group invariance and convergence of the truncation after the data is fitted order by order . in some cases , including the ones considered here , there exists a fine - tuning requires a bit more thought .    for the last ten years or so we have been developing efts for systems of few nucleons @xcite . the goal is to understand traditional nuclear physics from a qcd standpoint .",
    "much of this work has been devoted to the eft where @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite . in this eft , pions are explicit degrees of freedom , and ( approximate ) chiral symmetry plays a crucial role . while in the sector of @xmath17 nucleons this `` pionful '' eft reduces to well - understood chiral perturbation theory , in the @xmath18 sector power counting is more subtle @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a reasonably successful potential has been constructed @xcite .",
    "now , in many situations in particular , many astrophysical applications we are interested in reactions at momenta @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , as we are going to see , there is interesting nuclear physics in this regime .",
    "the typical momentum of nucleons in the deuteron is @xmath20 mev , which means that the deuteron is an object about three times larger than most of the pion cloud around each nucleon . for the @xmath21 virtual bound state ,",
    "the corresponding scale is even smaller , @xmath22 mev . for these states",
    "the pionful eft is an overkill .",
    "one can instead consider a much simpler eft where the meson cloud is represented by a multipole expansion : the lagrangian contains only nucleon fields with contact interactions .",
    "this `` pionless '' eft , for which @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( with @xmath25 some average of the @xmath26 ) , is now pretty well understood , despite the fact that one needs to account for fine - tuning through the anomalously - small scale @xmath25 .",
    "( it seems accidental that @xmath25 is smaller than a pion scale such as @xmath27 , which arises naturally in the pionful eft @xcite . )",
    "one way to do this is to introduce , in addition to the nucleon spinor / isospinor field @xmath28 of mass @xmath29 , two auxiliary ``dimeron'' fields , a scalar / isovector @xmath30 and a vector / isoscalar @xmath31 with masses @xmath32 @xcite .",

    ", the full @xmath6 matrix can be obtained by adding nucleon legs to the full dimeron propagators .",
    "the latter consist of insertions of particle bubbles generated by the two - particle / dimeron interaction see fig.[fig : auxprop] as well as insertions stemming from terms with more derivatives . since",
    "a two - nucleon bubble is @xmath39 , if @xmath40 and @xmath41 , then the bubbles have to be resummed in the @xmath36 waves @xcite .",

    "[ fig : nnphases ] .",
    "the deuteron binding energy is found to be @xmath54 mev in nlo , to be compared with the experimental value of 2.22 mev .",

    "likewise , the triton binding energy is found to be @xmath62 mev in nlo , to be compared with the experimental value of 8.48 mev .",
    "this eft simplifies the treatment of light nuclei , but the application to larger nuclei still faces computational challenges .",
    "( for the first attack on the four - body system , see refs .",
    "one would like to devise further simplifications in order to extend efts to larger nuclei .",
    "as a first step , we can specialize to very low energies where clusters of nucleons behave coherently . even though many interesting issues of nuclear structure are missed , we can at least describe anomalously - shallow ( `` halo '' ) nuclei and some reactions of astrophysical interest .",
    "i define a halo system as one that contains two momentum scales :    * @xmath63 , associated with the excitation energy @xmath64 of a tight cluster of nucleons ( `` core '' ) ; * @xmath65 , associated with the energy @xmath66 for the attachment or removal of one or more ( `` halo '' ) nucleons .",
    "these systems exhibit shallow @xmath67-matrix poles , either on the imaginary axis ( bound states ) or elsewhere in the complex momentum plane ( resonances ) . with this definition , the deuteron and the triton are two- and three - body halo systems , respectively . in these cases",
    "the core is a single nucleon , @xmath68 , while @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) for the deuteron ( triton ) .",
    "the next - simplest examples involve a @xmath71he core , for which @xmath72 mev .",
    "in contrast , the removal energy for two neutrons from @xmath73he is @xmath74 mev @xcite , making this a three - body halo nucleus .",
    "it is interesting that @xmath75he is not bound .",
    "however , the total cross section for neutron - alpha ( @xmath76 ) scattering has a prominent bump at @xmath77 mev , usually interpreted as a shallow @xmath78 resonance @xcite .",
    "in addition , reactions involving more complex nuclei are frequently characterized by shallow resonances that are narrow , corresponding to poles near the real momentum axis .",
    "it is natural to generalize the eft to describe shallow two - body resonances @xcite , as a step before tackling three - body halo nuclei . here ,",
    "for concreteness , i consider @xmath76 scattering , which will fix the @xmath79 effective interactions , necessary for a future study of @xmath73he .    now ,",

    "a bare dimeron propagator can generate two shallow real poles provided its @xmath96 is very small : i take @xmath97 ( where @xmath98 is the @xmath79 reduced mass ) .",

    "the expansion fails in the immediate neighborhood of the resonance .",
    "the reason for this failure is easy to understand . in a momentum region of @xmath114 around the resonance",
    "there is a cancellation in the denominator of the @xmath90 propagator , bubbles have to be resummed to all orders , and the @xmath90 propagator is enhanced by a factor of @xmath115 . in this region ,",

    "the success of this resummed nlo description is evident throughout the low - energy region .",
    "( note that an additional resummation of the @xmath89 propagator , which would be necessary if there was a shallow resonance in this channel , as sometimes claimed , does not seem to improve the results significantly . )",
    "the description of the phase shifts themselves also comes out pretty well , see ref .",
    "i have considered here only nuclear shallow states .",
    "however , the ideas discussed above are much more general .",
    "these efts can immediately be extended to other physical systems that contain shallow bound states , such as certain molecules @xcite .",
    "apart from specific applications , these efts have two interesting generic features that lend them some intrinsic mathematical interest as well .",
    "first , they are the simplest theories where short - distance physics produces non - perturbative structures at low energy .",
    "second , the non - perturbative character of the resulting renormalization shows unique features , such as limit cycles .",
    "much more work is possible along these lines see , _ e.g. _ ref . @xcite .",
    "more within the scope of this conference , there is certainly reason to push these efts in the direction of heavier nuclei .",
    "this is in fact just the very beginning of halo eft .",
    "the next step is to use the @xmath79 interactions determined from @xmath79 scattering @xcite and the @xmath38 interactions determined from @xmath38 scattering @xcite to calculate the halo @xmath73he as a @xmath117 system @xcite , the same way we successfully described triton as a @xmath118 system @xcite .",
    "but clearly the theory can be applied to reactions involving any halo nucleus .",
    "for example , to the extent that @xmath119b can be regarded as a halo , the reaction @xmath120 can be analyzed as was @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "this could become , i hope , a useful , systematic approach to physics near the driplines .",
