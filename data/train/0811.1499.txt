    "particles may be confined by a wide range of methods . these include trapping by optical means , confinement within materials , e.g. as dopants in solids , or within hollow structures such as fullerenes and nanotubes . as the ability to insert atoms or molecules into these carbon cages increased ,",

    "given the strong delocalisation of valence electrons of the fullerene , they are treated as a free electron gas .",
    "the dielectric function of the fullerene @xmath15 may be expressed via the drude model @xcite : @xmath16 the plasma frequency @xmath17 is : @xmath18 where n is the number of valence electrons and @xmath19 is the volume of the fullerene shell .",
    "the point - like endohedral atom is characterised by the dynamic dipole polarizability @xmath20 and can be located at an arbitrary position @xmath10 within the fullerene , see figure [ fig : noncentral_diagram ] .",
    "we consider the case when the endohedral system is in a uniform and monochromatic external field , whose strength is given by @xmath21 , where @xmath11 is a real amplitude .",

    "one has to carry out a self - consistent consideration which takes into account the mutual polarization of the atom and the fullerene .",
    "the self - consistent method is based on the iterative procedure developed in @xcite . for",
    "the sake of clarity , let us outline the main points of this procedure .    to begin with , one makes use of the following two auxiliary problems .",

    "in the case of a monochromatic field @xmath36 also acquires the dependence on @xmath38 .",
    "the second problem is the determination of the electric field @xmath39 due to the polarization of the shell by a point - like dipole @xmath40 located at the position @xmath10 inside the shell . using standard methods of electrostatics",
    ", one can demonstrate that at the position @xmath10 this field can be represented as follows : @xmath41 .",

    "then , the iterative procedure is as follows . at first",
    ", the external field polarizes the fullerene , giving rise to an additional field in the interior .",
    "these two fields combined give the field inside the fullerene @xmath45 , which induces a dipole moment in the atom @xmath46 . in the next iterative step , the dipole moment of the atom acts on the fullerene ( problem 2 ) , bringing about another field @xmath47 at the atom .",
    "an additional dipole moment is induced in the atom : @xmath48 . for the @xmath49 iteration : @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the total field is therefore : @xmath52 and the total dipole moment of the atom is @xmath53 .",

    "the corresponding widths and oscillator strengths of these modes are denoted by @xmath63 . within the framework of our approach ,",
    "the widths of these surface plasmon modes are not computed but are treated as parameters .    in ( [ eq : etotal ] ) , both @xmath64 and @xmath65 are related to the multipole expansion of the electric field in the situation , where a point - like dipole is positioned at @xmath10 inside the fullerene : @xmath64 is due to the field component parallel to the point like - dipole while @xmath65 is due to the component perpendicular to the dipole .",

    ", there is a strong narrow peak in the tdlda calculation that can not be described by our model .",
    "there is also a large difference about the symmetric plasmon mode at 16.5 ev .",
    "+ the following is a possible explanation for the large discrepancies for mg@c@xmath0 .",
    "there are two types of valence electrons of the fullerene : the @xmath2 and the @xmath1 electrons @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 electron is more strongly bound to the carbon core whereas the @xmath2 electron is more weakly bound . from this",
    "arises two types of surface plasmons : the @xmath1 plasmon and the @xmath2 plasmon ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath2 plasmon involves mainly the more loosely bound electrons and is located at about 20 ev while the @xmath1 plasmon involves only the strongly bound ones , resulting in a lower plasmon energy of around 10 ev @xcite .",
    "let us introduce the two types of plasmons into the dynamical screening factor . to do so , one models the fullerene as a system of two co - centric spherical shells .",
    "the valence electrons of the fullerene are distributed into these shells , so that one shell contains those , which participate in the @xmath1 plasmon , and the other contains the electrons from the @xmath2 plasmon . in reality",
    ", the plasmons will influence each other s resonance energy .",
    "we take the simplest approach , in which this effect is ignored .",
    "the finite thickness of the shells leads to the splitting of each plasmon into a symmetric and an antisymmetric mode .",
    "as observed in @xcite and seen in other theoretical works on these plasmon modes of the fullerene ( e.g. @xcite ) , the antisymmetric mode does not generally manifest itself as strongly as the other mode .",
    "the dynamical screening factor of such a system is calculated using the iterative scheme described in section [ sec : theory ] .",
    "the only modification to the scheme is the necessity of accounting for the two shells , which contribute to the total electric field at the centre .",
    "thus , at each iterative step , there is a contribution to the electric field at the atom due to the @xmath1 shell and to the @xmath2 shell .    with this modification ,",
    "the dynamical screening for the centrally positioned atom becomes ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : factor_central ] ) ) : @xmath81 the properties of the endohedral atom are encoded in its dynamic dipole polarizability @xmath20 . for the case",
    "where the polarizability of the confined atom is negligible , this is simply @xmath82    the modified dynamical screening factor is shown in figure [ fig : central ] as thick lines .",
    "the solid line is the dynamical screening factor for the limiting case and the dashed line accounts for the interaction between the polarized atom and the polarized fullerene .    for mg@c@xmath0 ,",
    "the pair of curves lie on top of each other , owing to the small dynamic dipole polarizability of magnesium in this energy range ( see figure [ fig : pol ] , right panel ) .",
    "there is an improvement in the correspondence between our model ( [ eq : factor_pi_pol ] ) and the tdlda calculations of @xcite .",
    "we have now reproduced the sharp peak near 10 ev that was missing from the original model . within the modified model",
    ", this feature is due to the symmetric mode of the @xmath1 plasmon .",
    "also reproduced is the additional feature near 20 ev arising from the antisymmetric mode .",
    "the positions of the 4 plasmon modes of the modified model are all indicated in figure [ fig : central ] in the bottom panel . as most clearly demonstrated in ( [ eq : factor_pi_nopol ] ) , the screening factor consists of direct squares and cross multiplication terms , which raise or lower it depending on the photon energy .",
    "these cross terms , or interference terms , are particularly significant in 3 regions indicated in the lower panel of figure [ fig : central ] by arrows labelled ` int . ' . in these regions ,",
    "the interference is strongly negative , resulting in well defined minima in the profile of the screening factor .",
    "there is still a quantitative difference near the symmetric mode of the @xmath2 plasmon .",
    "it is possible to reduce this difference by increasing @xmath83 , shifting @xmath84 towards @xmath85 , and reducing the corresponding widths .    for ar@c@xmath0 , the modification of the screening factor due to the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 plasmons has resulted in an even better correspondence with the tdlda calculation from @xcite .",
    "in these calculations , @xmath86 and @xmath83 were fixed to 80 and 160 respectively .",
    "the inner and outer radii and thicknesses of the two shells were adjusted to fit the energies of the plasmons observed in the tdlda calculation for mg@c@xmath0 .",
