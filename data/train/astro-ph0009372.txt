    "for example , it is not necessary for the toroidal structure to be perpendicular to the jet axis , the `` clumps '' of denser gas are unlikely to be uniform in size , and it is believed that the degree of warp in the disk can vary greatly .",
    "one possible explanation for the low observed levels of linear polarization from csos is that our line of sight to the jet components in these sources passes through a magnetized plasma associated with this torus . in order to depolarize the radio emission within our 8 mhz if at 8.4 ghz the faraday rotation measures could be larger than 5@xmath110@xmath2 radians m@xmath3 , or alternatively the magnetic fields in the torus could be tangled on scales smaller than the telescope beam of @xmath01 mas to produce gradients of 1000 radians m@xmath3 mas@xmath4 or more ."
