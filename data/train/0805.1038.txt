    "below a certain critical temperature , a well - mixed binary fluid spontaneously separates into its component parts , forming domains of pure liquid",

    "we study phase separation in a thin layer , in which the the varying free surface and concentration fields are coupled through a pair of nonlinear evolution equations .",
    "cahn and hilliard introduced their eponymous equation in  @xcite to model phase separation in a binary alloy . since then , the model has been used in diverse applications : to describe polymeric fluids  @xcite , fluids with interfacial tension  @xcite , and self - segregating populations in biology  @xcite .",
    "analysis of the cahn  hilliard ( ch ) equation was given by elliott and zheng in  @xcite , where they prove the existence , uniqueness , and regularity of solutions : given sufficiently smooth initial data , solutions to the ch equation are bounded for almost all time in the sobolev space @xmath0 .",
    "several authors have developed generalisations of the ch equation : a variable - mobility model was introduced by elliott and garcke  @xcite , while nonlocal effects were considered by gajweski and zacharias  @xcite .",
    "these additional features do not qualitatively change the phase separation , and we therefore turn to one mechanism that does : the coupling of a flow field to the cahn  hilliard equation  @xcite . in this case , the cahn  hilliard concentration equation is modified by an advection term , and the flow field is either prescribed or evolves according to some fluid equation .",
    "ding and co - workers  @xcite provide a derivation of coupled navier  stokes cahn  hilliard ( nsch ) equations in which the velocity advects the phase - separating concentration field , while concentration gradients modify the velocity through an additional stress term in the momentum equation .",
    "such models have formed the basis of numerical studies of binary fluids  @xcite , while other studies without this feedback term highlight different regimes of phase separation under flow  @xcite . in this paper ,",

    "then , provided vertical gradients are small compared to lateral gradients , a long - wavelength approximation is possible , in which the full equations with a moving boundary at the free surface are reduced to a single equation for the free - surface height . in the present case , the reduction yields two equations : one for the free surface , and one for the cahn  hilliard concentration . the resulting thin - film stokes cahn ",
    "hilliard equations have already been introduced by the authors in  @xcite , although the focus there was on control of phase separation and numerical simulations in three dimensions . here",
    "we confine ourselves to the two - dimensional case : we derive the thin - film equations from first principles , present analysis of the resulting equations , and highlight the impossibility of film rupture .",
    "along with the simplification of the problem that thin - film theory provides , there are many practical reasons for studying phase separation in thin layers .",

    "equations of cahn  hilliard type have been proposed to explain the qualitative features of self - assembly  @xcite , and knowledge of variations in the film height could enhance these models . indeed in  @xcite the authors use the present thin - film cahn  hilliard model in three dimensions to control phase separation , a useful tool in applications where it is necessary for the molecules in the film to form a given structure .",

    "is investigated .",
    "these works provide results concerning regularity , long - time behaviour , and film rupture in the presence of an attractive van der waals force .",
    "more relevant to the present work is the paper by wieland and garcke  @xcite , in which a pair of partial differential equations describes the coupled evolution of free - surface variations and surfactant concentration .",
    "the authors derive the relevant equations using the long - wavelength theory , obtain a decaying energy functional , and prove results concerning the existence and nonnegativity of solutions .",
