    "certain quantum systems in @xmath2 dimensions can support quasiparticles with anyonic and non - abelian statistics .",
    "these are experimentally realized in fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) systems . specifically , the @xmath3 fqh state is conjectured to be in the universality class of the moore - read ( mr ) pfaffian wavefunction , and it is believed that there is a fqh state at @xmath1 described by the @xmath4 read - rezayi ( rr ) state . both are non - abelian , and the latter supports universal quantum computation , making its study especially important .    in this paper we consider a double point contact geometry in an assumed @xmath1 rr state , and study tunneling in the edge theory .",
    "a similar setup is considered in [ ] .",
    "the edge theory consists of a charged boson , and a neutral sector described by the @xmath5 parafermion cft .",
    "the latter contains spin fields @xmath6 which are not local with respect to the other fields in the cft , and it is precisely these that enter the hamiltonian describing tunneling of quasiholes , which is the most relevant tunneling process at low temperatures .",
    "unfortunately it is difficult to interpret such a tunneling hamiltonian , because in a chiral theory , correlation functions of spin fields are not well defined .",
    "instead , they could be any linear combination of a finite number of _ conformal blocks_. in fact , it turns out that the choice of such linear combination is intimately related to the topology of the corresponding tunneling process occurring in the bulk ; [ ] give a prescription for determining the correct choice of linear combination , in the case of a single point contact .",
    "we adapt their method to the case of a double point contact and use it to compute the tunneling current to first order in perturbation theory .",
    "in contrast to the abelian case @xcite , we find that the interference term in the tunneling current is suppressed depending on the topological charge contained in the bulk region between the two point contacts .",
    "a crucial point is that a bulk quasihole affecting the tunneling current must be prepared and annihilated on the edge in the far past and future respectively , and the prescription of [ ] must be applied to this entire process .",
    "after one divides out the universal factor associated with preparing and annihilating the bulk quasihole , one obtains correlation functions of the original spin fields which are finite and correctly incorporate the effect of the bulk quasihole .",
    "we assume that there exists an incompressible quantum hall fluid at @xmath7 , and that it consists of a filled lowest landau level ( of both spins ) and a first landau level described by the @xmath4 read - rezayi state , which has filling factor @xmath8 .",
    "the read - rezayi wave function is a correlator of operators in the conformal field theory of a charged boson and @xmath5 parafermions .",
    "the parafermions contain @xmath9 fields : @xmath10 , and their fusion rules are determined by @xmath11 and @xmath12 [ ] .",
    "we will need the electron and quasihole operators ; they are as follows @xcite :    @xmath13    we have @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the chiral edge theory also consists of @xmath5 parafermions and a charged mode , but they propagate with different velocities , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "generally , one expects @xmath18 . in writing down the edge theory description of the tunneling hamiltonian , we a priori need to consider all sorts of tunneling processes , but a quick renormalization group argument @xcite shows that the most relevant term at low temperatures corresponds to an @xmath19-charge quasihole - the tunneling hamiltonian simply destroys such a quasihole on one side of the point contact and creates it on the other . here",
    "we assume we are at temperatures higher than those at which the crossover physics of [ ] , [ ] , etc",
    ". becomes important , so that the tunneling is weak and can be treated perturbatively .",
    "this is an important point , because when we make reference to zero temperature results from now on we actually mean temperature small compared to @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the bias voltage , and to @xmath22 and @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 being the distance between the two contacts ) but still large compared to the crossover temperature . note that we have @xmath27 different energy scales , set by the temperature , bias voltage , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the last two can not be varied independently , but only through the variation of the separation @xmath26 .",
    "the two cases we consider in this paper are zero temperature , where effectively we have one dimensionless parameter we can vary ( say @xmath30 ) , and temperature high compared to @xmath31 , where things simplify as well .",
    "the tunneling hamiltonian is    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the tunneling amplitude at the @xmath34th point contact ( @xmath35 ) , and @xmath36 is the josephson frequency corresponding to a charge @xmath19 quasihole .",
    "the tunneling operator @xmath37 is defined as    @xmath38    where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the spatial coordinates of the lower and upper sides of the @xmath34th point contact .",
    "note that because the hall bar is large but finite , the upper and lower points are actually on the same edge , just very far away from each other . from now on it will be convenient to use the parametrization @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the distance around the hall bar , which we will eventually take to infinity",
    "our discussion here closely parallels [ ] , except that we have the added complication of dealing with the parafermions and spin field operators . as mentioned before",
    ", there is ambiguity in treating the @xmath6 as operators , and their correlators are not well defined .",
    "indeed , to resolve the ambiguity we will need to add extra @xmath6 operators , which create and annihilate the bulk quasiholes in the far past and future . as we shall see , taking these to infinity essentially decouples them from the rest of the correlator , and their only influence is topological . in fact , together with making the hall bar really large ( that is , taking @xmath42 to infinity ) , the correlator of interest factors as a product of @xmath2-point functions , which is determined by conformal invariance up to a multiplicative constant .",
    "all of the effects mentioned above are incorporated in that constant , denoted by @xmath43 below . in this section",
    "we calculate the tunneling current leaving @xmath43 undetermined . in the next section",
    "we determine @xmath43 .",
    "we begin by writing down the appropriate operators .",
    "the operator for the current across the point contact is the commutator of the total charge and the tunneling hamiltonian ; because only the charge mode is involved the calculation is easy and we get    @xmath44    to lowest order in perturbation theory , the expectation value of the tunneling current is    @xmath45 | 0 \\rangle.\\ ] ]    we have    @xmath46    because the only terms that contribute to the vacuum expectation value are ones that conserve the total charge on each side of the hall bar .",
    "now ,    @xmath47}^{-2/15 } { \\left [   \\delta + i ( v_n ( t - t ' ) - ( x_j - x_k ) ) \\right]}^{-2/15 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & { \\left [   \\delta + i ( v_c ( t - t ' ) + ( x_j - x_k ) ) \\right]}^{-1/15 } { \\left [   \\delta + i ( v_c ( t - t ' ) - ( x_j - x_k))\\right]}^{-1/15}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath43 is the constant mentioned above , which is determined by choice of conformal block ( its phase is more subtle and convention dependent ) , and @xmath48 is an infinitesimal , specifying the choice of branch cut .",
    "we will obtain all the information about @xmath43 we need for our purposes in the next section .",
    "for now , define @xmath49 ^{-2/15 } \\left [ \\delta + i ( v_n t - x )   \\right ] ^ { -2/15 } \\left [ \\delta + i ( v_c t + x ) \\right]^{-1/15 } \\left [ \\delta + i ( v_c t - x ) \\right]^{-1/15}.\\ ] ] so that    @xmath50    in a similar manner we obtain    @xmath51    because @xmath52 and @xmath53 commute for spacelike separation , we have @xmath54 ( for @xmath55 the argument is a little more subtle but the conclusion holds - basically you have to infinitesimally spacelike separate the two operators and then argue using continuity ) .",
    "we therefore have    @xmath56 \\rangle & = & \\frac{ie}{5 } \\sum_{j , k } ( \\gamma_j { \\gamma_k}^ * e^{-i \\omega_j ( t - t ' ) } c_{jk } [ p(x_j - x_k , t - t ' ) - p(x_j - x_k , -(t - t ' ) ) ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & - { \\gamma_j}^ * \\gamma_k e^{i \\omega_j ( t - t ' ) } c_{kj } [ p(x_k - x_j , t - t ' ) - p(x_k - x_j,-(t - t ' ) ) ] ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    doing the integral in ( [ eqn : int ] ) we obtain    @xmath57\\ ] ]    where @xmath58 is the fourier transform of @xmath59 . for @xmath60 we can do the integral explicitly :    @xmath61    when @xmath62 , we can write down an alternate integral representation for @xmath63 as follows : in the integral for the fourier transform , the denominator is a product of @xmath27 terms , with @xmath64 ( the variable being integrated over ) appearing in each .",
    "we replace the @xmath64 integration with an integration over @xmath27 variables @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , replacing @xmath64 with @xmath65 in each term in the denominator , and adding in delta function constraints to make all the @xmath65 equal .",
    "this is just a rewriting of the original integral .",
    "we then use the integral representation of the delta functions to obtain :    @xmath67 \\nonumber \\\\ & & { | \\omega + \\omega_1|}^{-13/15 } { | \\omega_2 - \\omega_1 |}^{-13/15 } { | \\omega_3 - \\omega_2 |}^{-14/15 } { | \\omega_3 |}^{-14/15 } \\theta ( \\omega + \\omega_1 ) \\theta ( \\omega_2 - \\omega_1 ) \\theta ( \\omega_3 - \\omega_2 ) \\theta ( - \\omega_3)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    because the integrals over @xmath68 are all convergent in the above expression , we see that @xmath69 is continuous as a function of @xmath70 .",
    "we write    @xmath71    with this notation we obtain @xmath72",
    "the analysis of finite temperature effects again proceeds much in the same way as in [ ] .",
    "all the nontrivial topological information is still encoded in the @xmath43 .",
    "the only difference between the zero temperature and finite temperature case arises from the fact that the @xmath2-point functions we now wish to use are analytic continuations of @xmath2-point functions on a cylinder .",
    "the replacement that needs to be made is @xcite :    @xmath73}^{2/15 } } \\rightarrow { \\left [ \\frac{\\pi t } { \\sin [ \\pi t(\\delta + i ( t \\pm x / v_n ) ) ] } \\right]}^{2/15}\\ ] ]    for the @xmath6 correlator , and similarly for the correlator of the exponentials of the charge bosons , except with @xmath16 replaced by @xmath17 .",
    "we obtain the following modified @xmath74 :    @xmath75}{\\pi t } \\right]}^{-2/15 } { \\left [ \\frac{\\sin [ \\pi t(\\delta+i(t - x / v_n))]}{\\pi t } \\right]}^{-2/15 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & { \\left [ \\frac{\\sin [ \\pi t(\\delta+i(t+x / v_c))]}{\\pi t } \\right]}^{-1/15 } { \\left [ \\frac{\\sin [ \\pi t(\\delta+i(t - x / v_c))]}{\\pi t } \\right]}^{-1/15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as opposed to the case of [ ] , this integral is not exactly doable for arbitrary values of @xmath76 , the neutral and charge mode velocities .",
    "however , we can extract the behavior of the current at large values of the temperature . to do this ,",
    "simply note that the integrand above is basically a product of inverse powers of @xmath77 , which at @xmath78 large compared to @xmath22 and @xmath23 become decaying exponentials , suppressed everywhere except at @xmath79 .",
    "noting that the integral is everywhere convergent , we see that most of its contributions come from those @xmath27 points . plugging in , we see that we have an exponential suppression of    @xmath80\\ ] ]    of the interference term at high temperatures @xmath81 . comparing this to the result of [ ] who obtain    @xmath82\\ ] ]",
    "we see that we have an  effective \" @xmath83 of @xmath84 .",
    "we now come to the crux of the problem , which is to find the constants @xmath43 .",
    "this basically comes down to determining the conformal blocks for the @xmath85 correlators , and here the topology comes into play . working in the context of the @xmath86 state and a single point contact , [ ] argued that for a given quasihole tunneling process , the two @xmath87 fields that create and destroy the quasihole should fuse to the identity . arguing along these lines",
    ", one can uniquely determine the desired conformal block .",
    "it is here that one uses the connection between the bulk and the boundary : the tunneling topology in the bulk determines the fusion channels of the tunneling operators in the boundary field theory . to give an actual argument for this connection would require a detailed examination of bulk tunneling , which has not been done .",
    "we shall , as in [ ] , adopt it as part of the definition of the tunneling operator , and adapt it to our case of a double point contact .",
    "we wish to probe the effect of test quasiholes , residing on anti - dots in the region between the two point contacts , on the tunneling current .",
    "the main conceptual point we wish to stress is that to do the computation correctly , one must incorporate the creation and annihilation of these test quasiholes in the far past and future .",
    "that is , we must include two more @xmath85 operators - we will take them to be on the same side of the hall bar , creating the quasihole in the far past and annihilating it in the far future ( see fig ( [ f1 ] ) ) . for simplicity",
    ", we will analyze just two situations : one without any test quasiholes , and one with a single test quasihole , and for easy comparison we will actually create a test quasihole in both situations , but keep it far away from the region of interest in one case ( so that it has trivial braiding ) . for definiteness , we will for now analyze the following correlator , one of two that contribute to the interference term :    @xmath88    here the test quasihole is created at @xmath89 , and annihilated at @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath91 and @xmath42 are to be taken to infinity .",
    "we find it convenient to send @xmath42 to infinity first , so the thing splits into a @xmath27 point and a @xmath2 point function by cluster decomposition .",
    "let s see what happens when @xmath91 goes to infinity .",
    "then @xmath92 and @xmath93 can be considered to be very close ( in comparison with @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) , so we can use the operator product expansion on them .",
    "clearly the leading contribution comes from the identity , so that s the only one we need to retain in the limit .",
    "the @xmath27-point function is then just the @xmath2-point function of @xmath92 and @xmath93 times an overall constant having to do with the preparation and annihilation of the test quasihole .            from the above paragraph",
    ", we see that it is very convenient to work in the basis where the fusion channels of the pairs @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 are known , because only in the case when all those fusion channels are the identity do we get a nonzero contribution .",
    "but the conformal block we re interested in is specified in a different basis . to express it in the new basis ,",
    "we proceed as in [ ] and project the worldlines of the quasiholes ( including the test quasihole ) to two dimensions ; the linear transformation necessary to enact the basis change is the matrix representing the resulting braid .",
    "the conformal block we start with is :    @xmath99    we want to expand it in the new basis above , and in particular get the coefficient of @xmath100    depending on whether or not the test quasihole resides in the region between the two point contacts , we have two possible braiding histories , shown in figures ( [ fb1 ] ) and ( [ fb2 ] ) . because , due to the considerations outlined below , we only care about the coefficients up to phase , we only need to determine the matrix for the linear transformation between the two bases up to phase . thus , even though a priori we would have to deal with the moore - seiberg braid matrix for the parafermions ( and the associated @xmath101 theory ) , we really only need the braid matrix in the associated quantum group picture . here , both @xmath102 and @xmath103 correspond to the @xmath2-dimensional spin @xmath104 representation of @xmath105 , @xmath106 . labeling conformal blocks using the bratteli diagram notation , we see that we start off with the block represented by the path @xmath107 $ ] , which for convenience we will designate via shortened notation by @xmath108 $ ] .",
    "we see that when the braids in ( [ fb1 ] ) and ( [ fb2 ] ) act , everything happens in the subspace spanned by @xmath109 $ ] , @xmath110 , and each transposition acts either only on @xmath70 or only on @xmath111 ( they commute ) .",
    "the relevant unitary matrix enacting the transposition is [ ] :    @xmath112    where @xmath113 .",
    "the @xmath2-element basis in which we write the matrix @xmath114 is @xmath115 , and the one corresponding to @xmath116 is @xmath117 .",
    "note also that , using some identities involving the golden mean , we have :    @xmath118    we have    @xmath119 | u_{2,3 } | [ 0101010 ] \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\tau } \\\\ \\label{feqn1 } \\langle [ 0101010 ] | u_{2,3 } { u^2}_{4,5 } | [ 0101010 ] \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\tau^3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let us now use this to obtain the @xmath43 .",
    "first , let s see what we can surmise on general grounds . by tuning @xmath120 to @xmath121 and using the fact that @xmath122 is real",
    ", we find that @xmath123 is real . also , by symmetry , @xmath124 . again",
    "because the current is real we see that @xmath125 .",
    "the phase @xmath126 can in principle be determined , but we ignored it in the calculations above .",
    "this is because the effect of changing @xmath126 is the same as that of changing the phases of @xmath127 and @xmath120 , which are hard to determine anyway and are sensitive to the aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "the results in ( [ feqn ] ) and ( [ feqn1 ] ) show that when a quasihole is present , @xmath128 is diminished by a factor of @xmath129 .",
    "similar topological calculations ( with only the spatial coordinates of the points involved changing ) show that the other constants , @xmath123 and @xmath130 , are always equal , and equal to the @xmath128 in the case when there is no test quasihole in the region between the point contacts .",
    "thus we have    @xmath131    @xmath132    where @xmath133 is an unimportant constant .",
    "we thus observe that even without looking at phases , nonabelian statistics have a robust effect of changing the magnitude of the coefficient of the interference term in the tunneling current .",
    "this is in line with earlier arguments of [ ] for the differential conductivity .",
