    "it is believed that many or most galaxies house massive black holes ( bhs ) at their centers ( e.g. magorrian et al . 1998 ) .",
    "mergers of galaxies , which are a central part of the galaxy formation process in the hierarchical structure formation picture , will inevitably form binary black holes ( bbhs ) if every galaxy has a central bh and the bh inspiral time is less than a hubble time . the questions of whether the binaries merge and how long they survive before the merger are relevant to resolving a number of problems in extragalactic astronomy , such as the detection of gravitational waves ( e.g. folkner 1998 ) , the bending and precession of radio jets from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) @xcite , the shapes of fe k@xmath7 emission line profiles from agns @xcite etc . on the other hand , so far there is not much observational evidence that bbhs exist , which might be expected if ( i ) the lifetime of the bbh is much shorter than the hubble time , ( ii ) the hierarchical model of galaxy formation is incorrect , or ( iii ) the bhs are efficiently ejected from the galaxy by three - body interactions , or other processes .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the lifetime of bbhs in realistic galaxy models .",
    "consider two massive bhs with masses @xmath8 in the core of a galaxy .",
    "the merger of the bbh mainly involves four processes @xcite .",
    "first , the dynamical friction stage : each bh sinks independently towards the center of the common gravitational potential on the chandrasekhar dynamical friction timescale : t_df~ ( ) ( ) ^2 ( ) ( i=1,2 ) , [ eq : tdf ] where the core is assumed to have a one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath9 , a core radius @xmath10 and to contain @xmath11 stars .",
    "second , the non - hard binary stage : the two bhs eventually form a bound binary system that continues to lose energy by dynamical friction . as the binary shrinks ,",
    "the effectiveness of dynamical friction slowly declines with the increase of the bh velocity and the shortening of its orbital period , and the three - body interactions between the bbh and the stars passing in their vicinity gradually become the dominant factor that makes the bbh lose energy .",
    "third is the hard binary stage : when aa=2.8(m_2 10 ^ 8)(200c)^2[eq : ah ] ( @xmath12 : gravitational constant ) , the bbh becomes hard @xcite .",
    "hard bbhs lose energy mainly by interacting with stars passing in their vicinity , most of which will be expelled from the bbh with an energy gain after one or more encounters with it . in such expulsions",
    "the average relative change in the bbh energy , @xmath13 , is independent of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the final stage is the gravitational radiation stage : as the bbh continues to harden , its semimajor axis decreases to the point at which gravitational radiation becomes the dominant dissipative force .",
    "a bbh on a circular orbit will then merge within the time @xcite : t_merge(a)~ = 5.810 ^ 6()^4 ( ) ^3 , [ eq : tmerge ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the reduced mass and total mass of the binary , respectively , and @xmath17 . if @xmath18 ( hence , @xmath19 in equation [ eq : ah ] is small ) , gravitational radiation can become the dominant dissipative force before the hard binary stage begins ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : timesph ] or ",
    "[ sec : testassmp ] below ) .",
    "the largest uncertainty in the bbh lifetime comes during the second ( non - hard binary ) stage or the third ( hard binary ) stage , either of which can be the slowest of the above four processes .",
    "the time spent in the second or third stage may vary by several orders of magnitude depending on whether or not the low - angular momentum core stars that interact most strongly with the bbh are depleted before the bbh decays to the gravitational radiation stage .    in this paper",
    ", we will estimate bbh evolution timescales in realistic galaxy models obtained from observations of the central regions of nearby galaxies . to determine the bbh evolution timescale at the slowest stage",
    ", the crucial thing is to get the bbh hardening timescale associated with interactions with stars in the hard binary stage ( see equation [ eq : th ] below ) , which is longer than the hardening timescale in the non - hard binary stage .",
    "the bbh hardening timescale in the hard binary stage gives the slowest evolution timescale or its upper limit no matter whether the slowest stage is the hard binary stage or the non - hard binary stage .",
    "so , our analysis starts from the beginning of the third of the above stages , when the bbh becomes hard .",
    "the theory we shall develop in   [ sec : lr ] and   [ sec : evlafh ] has been applied to study tidal disruption rates around massive bhs , the evolution of galactic nuclei , etc . and was first developed to describe the evolution of globular clusters containing massive black holes @xcite .",
    "a simple analysis of the timescales in the first two stages is given in ",
    "[ sec : evlbfh ] .",
    "we will only consider purely stellar dynamical processes , ignoring the uncertain , but usually small , contribution from gas .",
    "we will also ignore the response of the core structure to the bbh evolution and assume that the stellar system is in a fixed steady state .",
    "the justification for this assumption is that the total stellar mass removed from the galactic core during the bbh hardening is generally less than the core mass ( see equations [ eq : minact ] , [ eq : jrm ] or figures  [ fig : mlrjrm ] , [ fig : minact ] below ) .",
    "we present the results of the evolution of bbhs in realistic galaxy models in ",
    "[ sec : res ] and the estimated observational properties of surviving bbhs in   [ sec : bbhpro ] .",
    "finally , discussion and conclusions are given in ",
    "[ sec : discon ] .",
    "in this section , we introduce the concept of `` loss region '' for stellar systems with bbhs ; more specifically , we shall use the terms `` loss cone '' for spherical systems and `` loss wedge '' for axisymmetric systems .      in a stellar system with a single stellar mass @xmath20 and radius @xmath21 ,",
    "the distribution function ( df ) @xmath22 is defined so that @xmath23 is the number of stars within a phase - space volume @xmath24 of @xmath25 .",
    "we will consider the generalization to a distribution of masses and radii in ",
    "[ sec : gendis ] . by jeans",
    "s theorem , in a spherical system the df depends on @xmath25 only through the orbital binding energy per unit mass @xmath26 and angular momentum per unit mass @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is related to the gravitational potential @xmath29 through @xmath30 .",
    "if a bh has mass @xmath31 , stars that pass within a distance @xmath32 of the bh will be tidally disrupted if @xmath33 and swallowed whole if @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the speed of light , and @xmath36 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "the region in the ( specific energy , specific angular momentum ) phase space where stars can be tidally disrupted at pericenter is called the `` loss cone '' ( cf . frank & rees 1976 ) , and given by : j^2j^2()2r_t^2 2gm_r_t ( gm_/r_t ) .",
    "[ eq : rtlosscone ]    now , consider a hard bbh with the masses @xmath37 and semimajor axis @xmath38 ( see equation [ eq : ah ] ) .",
    "the radius of the sphere of influence of the bh , @xmath39 , is defined implicitly in terms of the intrinsic one - dimensional velocity dispersion of the galaxy @xmath40 through ^2(a)=gm_/a^2 .",
    "[ eq : ah ] note that @xmath39 is different from @xmath41 which represents the semimajor axis at which the bbh becomes hard .",
    "given a total bbh mass @xmath31 , @xmath19 depends on the mass of the smaller bh @xmath42 , while @xmath39 does not .",
    "we set the core velocity dispersion @xmath43 since in the core , the one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath40 generally varies only slowly outside @xmath39 [ e.g. the `` @xmath44 '' models of the density distribution for @xmath45 in dehnen ( 1993 ) and tremaine et al .",
    "( 1994 ) ] . at large radii ( @xmath46 ) , the bbh acts as a central point with mass @xmath47 and the stars move in the potential of the stars and the central mass point @xmath31 , with no systematic loss or gain of energy .",
    "the stars interacting most strongly with the bbh have low angular momenta with pericenters @xmath48 ( @xmath49 is a dimensionless factor @xmath50 ) .",
    "they may either lose or gain energy after their first encounters with the hard bbh , but eventually most of the stars will be expelled from the potential of bbh with an energy gain @xcite . as will be seen from equation ( [ eq : deltae ] ) below , the energy gain of a star is usually large enough for it to escape from the core when the bbh is hard , especially when @xmath51 . by replacing @xmath52 with @xmath53 in equation ( [ eq : rtlosscone ] ) , the loss cone in the bbh system",
    "is given as : j^2j^2(,f_a a)2gm_f_a a = 2g(m_1+m_2)f_a a ( gm_/f_a a ) ; [ eq : alosscone ] thus @xmath54 will decrease as the bbh hardens .",
    "the bbh interacts most strongly with the core stars in the loss cone , and the stars escaping from the core with energy gain are considered as being removed from the loss cone .",
    "the bbh energy loss rate is determined by the rate of removal of stars from the loss cone ( the `` clearing rate '' ) . at first",
    ", the depletion of the initial population of stars in the loss cone determines the clearing rate .",
    "as stars are removed from the loss cone , new stars are scattered into the loss cone by two - body relaxation @xcite and resonant relaxation @xcite , and eventually the clearing rate reaches a steady state controlled by the balance between the loss rate and the rate at which stars refill the loss cone . if the rms angular momentum transferred to or from the stars per orbital period is larger than @xmath54 , then the stars will refill the loss cone as fast as it is depleted and the loss cone remains full ; otherwise , the stars will slowly diffuse into the loss cone and the loss cone remains nearly empty .",
    "thus at large radii , the loss cone is full ( `` pinhole '' regime ) and at small radii , the loss cone is nearly empty ( `` diffusion '' regime ) [ the terms come from lightman & shapiro ( 1977 ) ] .",
    "the transition radius or binding energy between the two regimes is denoted by @xmath55 or @xmath56 [ @xmath57 . if most of the stars contributing to the bbh orbital decay have energy @xmath58 , which is generally a good approximation as will be seen from ",
    "[ sec : testassmp ] , the rate of refilling the loss cone in a bbh system can be determined from existing tidal disruption calculations , simply by replacing the tidal disruption radius @xmath59 with @xmath53 . the refilling rate caused by two - body relaxation",
    "can be obtained by solving the steady - state fokker - planck equation ( e.g. equation 17 in magorrian & tremaine 1999 , hereafter mt ) .",
    "the loss cone in the bbh system can be approximated as static even though the loss cone shrinks slowly as the bbh orbit decays because the timescale of the stellar diffusion into the loss cone is generally shorter than the bbh hardening timescale ( see   [ sec : testassmp ] below ) .",
    "resonant relaxation is effective only within a radius enclosing a mass @xmath60 of stars and does not contribute significantly to the total refilling rate ; therefore , it will be neglected ( see mt or   [ sec : testassmp ] below ) .      in an axisymmetric galaxy ,",
    "the df involves three integrals : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the component of angular momentum along the symmetry ( @xmath63-)axis and @xmath64 is a third integral .",
    "if the axisymmetric galaxy is nearly spherical , the third integral @xmath64 may be approximated by the angular momentum @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "in axisymmetric galaxies , there exist centrophilic orbits such as box orbits , which pass arbitrarily close to the center and have low angular momentum , as well as centrophobic orbits such as loop orbits , which avoid the center and have high angular momentum . here , we introduce @xmath66 to mark the transition from centrophilic ( @xmath67 ) to centrophobic ( @xmath68 ) orbits .",
    "stars on centrophilic orbits with @xmath69 can precess into the loss cone , while those on centrophobic orbits with @xmath70 can not .",
    "hence , in an axisymmetric galaxy , the loss cone is replaced by a loss wedge with @xmath69 ( mt ) .",
    "the bbh energy loss rate is determined initially by the clearing rate from the loss wedge and in the steady state by the rates at which two - body relaxation and tidal forces refill the loss wedge .    likewise , in a triaxial galaxy , we may expect that there also exists some characteristic angular momentum @xmath66 which marks the transition from centrophilic to centrophobic orbits , and most of the stars with @xmath71 can precess into the loss cone .",
    "we shall call the region @xmath71 the `` loss region '' in triaxial galaxies .",
    "thus , the bbh energy loss rate is determined initially by the clearing rate from the loss region and in the steady state by the rates at which two - body relaxation and tidal forces refill the loss region .",
    "the stars contributing to the orbital decay of a hard bbh come from the loss region . assuming",
    "that @xmath72 is the clearing rate from the loss region for stars with energy @xmath73 , the energy loss rate of the bbh is given by : |(a)|=-m_*f(,a ) , [ eq : energyloss ] where @xmath74 is the average specific energy change of the stars escaping from the bbh during an interaction with the bbh , and the semimajor axis of the bbh is @xmath75 .",

[",

    "it is hard to find bbhs by double - peaked emission lines from blrs either because it takes a long time ( @xmath394 ) to identify the periodic variability of double peaks with timescales of bbh orbital periods or because the strength of one component is too weak to separate it from the other one .",

    "none of these nearby common inactive galaxies has shown signs of surviving bbhs ( close double nuclei with separation @xmath395 ) at their centers .",
