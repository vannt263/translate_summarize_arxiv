    "experimental studies of quantum information processing ( qip ) has progressed much in recent years . in studies of qip using trapped ions , realization of small scale computation and entanglement generation with relatively high fidelity has been reported @xcite , which reveals that there is no fundamental obstacle to scaling a large number of ions .",
    "the upcoming challenges are large - scale operations and high - fidelity gate operations toward fault - tolerant quantum computation .    as a way to realize high - fidelity gate operations , quantum gates and quantum computation using geometric phase factors have recently been studied .",
    "this originates from holonomic quantum computation ( hqc ) proposed by zanardi _",
    "et al._@xcite  in hqc , degenerate multiple quantum states are utilized and unitary operations are performed by varying the system hamiltonian along a closed path in the parameter space .",
    "the final state in the hqc is dependent only on the global property of the closed path ; therefore , hqc is considered to be robust against certain types of errors . even when diabatic evolutions of the system or nondegenerate quantum states are used , similar advantages can be expected as long as the unitary operations performed are determined by geometric phase factors [ geometric quantum computation ( gqc)@xcite ] .",
    "there have been a number of experiments in different systems related to gqc @xcite .",
    "it is known that universal quantum computation can be realized with a combination of single - qubit and two - qubit operations @xcite . as demonstrations of two qubit operations in trapped - ion systems , `` geometric - phase gate '' by leibried _",
    "et al._@xcite and the mlmer - srensen gate @xcite have been realized .",
    "a gate fidelity of 99.3% has been realized using such a scheme @xcite .",
    "single qubit operations in trapped - ion systems have been performed to date using a dynamical method with variable pulse lengths and phases . by replacing such a method with those that use geometric phases , gate operations that are robust against variation of parameters such as pulse intensity and lengths can be expected .    in this work",
    ", we report the realization of purely geometric single qubit operations using a four - level system in a single @xmath0ca@xmath2 ion .",
    "three transitions in the four - level system are excited either by three optical fields or by two optical fields and one rf magnetic field .",
    "rotation operations by arbitrary angles along two different axes , @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the bloch sphere for the qubit , are demonstrated by utilizing stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) in this four - level system .",
    "robustness against parameter variations is also demonstrated .",
    "this work is based on proposals using a _ tripod _ system comprising of one upper state and three lower states connected by three oscillating fields @xcite .",
    "there are two dark states in the system , and those dark states are adiabatically manipulated with the intensities and phases of the oscillating fields to perform single - qubit operations .",
    "there was also a proposal and demonstrations of single - qubit operations using geometric phase factors using a two - level system and square pulses @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge no adiabatic ( or holonomic ) demonstration of single - qubit operations using dark states has been reported so far .",
    "here the formalization of the scheme is summarized based on kis and renzoni @xcite for later reference .",
    "a four - level system comprising of @xmath5 is considered [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1](a ) ] .",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 span a qubit manifold , while @xmath8 represents an upper state and @xmath9 represents an auxiliary state used in stirap .",

    ".    the following states in the qubit manifold are useful for describing the hamiltonian and explaining the gate procedure : @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and similarly , the following states in the total lower - state manifold spanned by @xmath22 : @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 . based on these",

    "this operation corresponds to a rotation by angle @xmath48 around @xmath49 , which can be taken arbitrarily by selecting the values for @xmath50 and @xmath51 , hence arbitrary single - qubit operations can be performed .",
    "this scheme is based on adiabatic population transfer using @xmath36 , and diabatic transitions from this state to @xmath52 are among the possible causes of infidelity in gate operations .",
    "the probability for such diabatic transitions is calculated to be in the order of @xmath53$]@xcite , which should be set to be much smaller than 1 to maintain high fidelity .",
    "the experimental setup has been previously described @xcite and only a brief description is given here .",
    "a single @xmath0ca@xmath1 is trapped in vacuum ( @xmath54 pa ) using a linear paul trap .",
    "the trap used here is a conventional linear trap with an operating frequency of 23 mhz and secular frequencies of @xmath55 mhz . a bias magnetic field of @xmath56 t",
    "is applied to define a quantization axis , which results in a zeeman splitting of @xmath574.9 mhz between @xmath58 sublevels . in experiments that employ three optical fields ,",
    "a titanium sapphire laser at 729 nm stabilized to a high - finesse low - thermal - expansion cavity is used for the excitation of ions between @xmath59 and @xmath58 .",
    "the amplitudes and frequencies of the three optical fields at 729 nm are changed by varying the three rf fields that are combined and fed to an acousto - optic modulator .",
    "the rf fields are generated by three direct - digital synthesis ( dds ) boards that are controlled by a field - programmable gate array .",
    "polarization of the optical fields is adjusted so that there are polarizations both parallel and perpendicular to the bias magnetic field ; therefore , the transition to be excited is selected by changing the frequencies of the dds boards . in experiments that employ two optical fields and one rf magnetic field , an rf coil in the vicinity of the trap is used to generate the rf field .",
    "the details of the rf excitation procedure are similar to that described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have chosen the @xmath59@xmath58 electric - quadrupole transition of @xmath0ca@xmath1 for realizing the geometric phase gate .",
    "the encoding of the tripod system to the sublevels in @xmath59 and @xmath58 is as follows : @xmath60 as the `` upper '' state @xmath8 and three zeeman sublevels in @xmath58 ( @xmath61 ) as the lower states @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath9 , respectively ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1](c ) ) .",
    "the reason that a level in @xmath59 is adopted instead of one in @xmath62 as @xmath8 is to avoid the effects of spontaneous emissions when all the fields are resonant .",
    "however , unwanted couplings between @xmath63 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath9 must still be considered .",
    "since these couplings are off resonance , varying @xmath64 leads to time - dependent ac - stark shifts that disturb the null eigenenergies of the qubit states .",
    "this effect was numerically evaluated with realistic parameters and the phase accumulated during the gate operation was confirmed to be smaller than 0.5 rad under typical experimental conditions in the present work .",
    "we essentially do not compensate such ac - stark shifts for the present work . in the experiments in  [ sec : xzrotations ] and of rotations by angle @xmath65 in  [ sec : fidelity ] , we adjust one of the detunings ( one for @xmath8@xmath6 ) so that fringe shift resulting from ac - stark shifts are apparently canceled .",
    "this cancelation depends on the details of the stirap pulses , including such conditions as peak rabi frequencies , pulse shapes or total time ( it may not depend on such conditions as input states or rotation angles since ac stark shifts do not depend on these ) .",
    "we also evaluate gate performances without cancellation of this type by examining rotations by angle @xmath66 with relatively low rabi frequencies in  [ sec : fidelity ] and  [ sec : discussions ] .",
    "the procedure for gate operations is as follows .",
    "firstly , the ion is cooled to near the motional ground state with doppler cooling by 397 and 866 nm and with sideband cooling of the axial motion by lasers at 729 and 854 nm .",
    "the average motional quantum number along axial direction after sideband cooling is @xmath67 .",
    "optical pumping using a 397 nm @xmath68 transition is then performed to initialize the ion in @xmath60 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the ion is transferred from @xmath8 to the computational manifold spanned by @xmath45 using square @xmath65 pulses , and then a gate stirap pulse sequence is applied between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the pulse shape of the gate consists of partially overlapping sinusoidal curves and constant values , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](d ) . a step variation of @xmath69 by @xmath70 , which brings a geometric phase factor , is given at the middle of the gate sequence where @xmath71 .",
    "after the gate sequence , a square @xmath65 pulse is applied to map the state of @xmath6 to @xmath8 .",
    "an additional pulse may also be applied , depending on the element of the density matrix to be observed .",
    "state discrimination is performed by detecting fluorescence from the ion with a photomultiplier tube during a period of 7 ms when 397 and 866 nm fields are applied@xcite .",
    "the time dependence of the optical pulses is chosen as follows ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 ) : @xmath77 @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the maximum values for @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively . in the experimental results given in this article , the values of @xmath83",
    "were empirically chosen to in between 0.55 and 0.85 so that effective population transfer was attained in experiments and/or numerical simulations .",
    "it is noted that the values of @xmath83 used in this article are not thoroughly optimized ones but those that give relatively good performances among tested .",
    "we show that arbitrary one - qubit operations can be realized with the geometric method introduced here .",
    "this can be accomplished by showing @xmath3- and @xmath4-rotations independently , because arbitrary operations can be decomposed into sequences of such rotations .",
    "the procedure for @xmath3-rotations is as follows .",
    "the ion is first prepared in @xmath8 by sideband cooling and optical pumping , then initialized to @xmath6 , and a stirap sequence is applied to perform a geometric gate .",
    "after this , the populations of the final states are analyzed by mapping the qubit states to the optical transition using a rectangular @xmath65 pulse on @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "the populations in @xmath9 and @xmath8 are also measured to verify that the gate operation is closed to the manifold spanned by the qubit states @xmath45 .",

    "the contrasts of the populations of @xmath6 and @xmath7 are obtained by fitting to @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "the procedure for observation of @xmath4-rotations is similar to ramsey interferometry .",

    "in order to investigate the action of gate operations more quantitatively , we also performed estimation of gate fidelities by using quantum state tomography .",

    "the population out of the computational manifold ( population in @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) before application of the mapping pulse , which is typically below 0.05 as described before , is ignored here for simplicity .",
    "the mapping pulse itself produces a geometric phase relative to the other states ( @xmath7 and @xmath9 ) , which should be taken into account properly in the fidelity analysis .",
    "the mapping operation can be described as follows : @xmath108 this corresponds to a rotation by angle @xmath65 around the @xmath109 axis in the bloch sphere of the two - level system @xmath110 .",

    "this can be explained by the fact that the scheme is not sensitive to one - photon detunings but only to two - photon detunings ( as will be described later in this section ) .",
    "the contribution from laser - frequency fluctuations may be larger when the encoding as in  [ sec : rf ] is used .",
    "ac stark shifts were compensated in this case by detuning one of the beams as described before .",
    "the possible fidelity loss from not performing compensation would amount to 2030 % in our simulation .",
    "for the results of x- and z - rotations by angle @xmath66 , the largest infidelity factor was diabaticity ( 25 % ) , and the effect of magnetic field fluctuations was 13 % .",
    "although no ac - stark - shifts compensation was performed in this case , infidelity due to ac stark shifts was as small as 01 % , and the effect of laser - frequency fluctuations was 0.20.3 % .",
    "the scheme demonstrated here is useful not only for atomic systems ( neutral or ionic ) , but also for other systems including solid - state systems .",
    "the scheme is effective for those systems where the coherence time is relatively long , but inhomogeneities of the excitation field intensities can not be avoided , or for those where slow intensity fluctuations of excitation fields occur .",
    "it can also be used effectively in assuring equal operations in a large ensemble of particles .",
    "the requirements for the scheme are that a sufficient number of levels are available for implementation , and that energy shifts due to excitation fields ( such as ac stark shifts ) can be avoided .",
    "elimination of ac stark shifts is not a straightforward task for the scheme presented here since a number of fields with time - dependent amplitudes are used .",
    "it can be confirmed from numerical simulations that the operations of the stirap gates are not sensitive to one - photon detunings ( i.e. detunings for @xmath157@xmath8 where @xmath158 and @xmath159 ) but to every two - photon detuning , and hence all relative shifts between two of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath9 should be minimized .",
    "this might be relatively complicated for _ e.g. _ @xmath0ca@xmath1 since , in addition to adjacent zeeman components in @xmath59@xmath58 , dipole - allowed transitions such as @xmath59@xmath154 , @xmath59@xmath62 and @xmath58@xmath62 also give rise to appreciable ac stark shifts@xcite .",
    "the scheme demonstrated here realizes single - qubit operations that are in general noncommutable to each other by using adiabatic manipulation of dark states .",
    "these amount to implementations of noncommutable ( non - abelian ) holonomies , which can be a building block of hqc by zanardi _",
