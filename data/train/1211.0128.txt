    "in general relativity , an energy - momentum tensor concentrated on a time - like hypersurface is called a surface layer.einsteins equations relate it to the jumps of the second fundamental form equivalent to the extrinsic curvature.the algorithms to calculate the same has been given in@xcite-@xcite .",
    "a surface layer has no component in the normal direction , otherwise the delta like character would be destroyed.hence an ideal fluid with non - vanishing pressure can not be concentrated on an arbitrarily thin region therefore in most cases this layer is composed of dust .",
    "additionally , an intrinsic 3- pressure has been taken into account in@xcite@xcite .",
    "the absence of radial pressure has been illustrated by assumption of identical particles moving on circular orbits @xcite,@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic 3-pressure and surface tension are of both dimensions force per unit length .",
    "the 3-pressure(equal to tangential pressure ) of a surface layer has been related to surface tension in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "negative tangential pressure depends on the four - velocity of the hypersurface.we make the tangential pressure independent of four - velocity on the surface layer .",
    "this we do by a suitable choice of two enveloping surfaces @xmath0 and @xmath1 embedding the surface layer . @xmath0 has time - like hypersurface and @xmath1 has space - like hypersurface .",

    "this hypersurface only overlaps a thin region of the hypersurface of @xmath0.these two hypersurfaces do nt intersect , so there are no inner boundaries @xcite .",
    "the hypersurface of @xmath1 has negative normal curvature.a discussion of surface layer based on the second fundamental form has been done in @xcite .",
    "the second fundamental form must not be equal in the two enveloping manifolds having a common boundary .",
    "it must have opposite signs for the surface layer to exist .",

    "the points on the surface layer become stationary .",
    "we therefore consider the surface tension of the surface layer as a central force interaction.for this choice of a surface , surface tension arises only from the internal interactions of the points on surface layer .",
    "therefore we assume the work done by the stretching force of surface tension to be stored as energy of the surface layer .",
    "there can be different phenomenological representations of @xmath2,the negative tangential pressure to arrive at the classical kelvin relation .",
    "here we have used the definition of normal curvature h of the time - like hypersurface of @xmath0 space as the analogue of mean curvature , represented by h in kelvin s formula @xcite .",
    "normal curvature has been preferred since it only depends on the point on the patch of the surface layer where it is calculated.also it only depends on the sense of the normal of the enveloping spaces of the hypersurface.the sum of the normal curvatures of surface is defined as the product of the * m.etric * and the * second fundamental tensor*.note that the second fundamental tensor is equivalent to the extrinsic curvature @xmath3 of the hypersurface.we know that the extrinsic curvature defines how a hypersuface bends in the space - time in which it is embedded @xcite.the dimension of the enveloping space is only one greater than that of the hypersurface.this ensures that there will only be one unique linearly independent normal curvature of the hypersurface of @xmath0 space which is the surface layer here .",
    "we calculate the pressure difference across the surface layer.for this we use the change in the divergence of the unit normal in the two enveloping spaces i.e.@xmath0 and @xmath1 . + the paper proceeds as follows : section 2 contains kelvin s relation for non - relativistic surface tensions discussed in @xcite.also here we give a brief of the representation of tangential pressure in @xcite .",
    "we justify our representation of the same.in section 3 , we discusses the definition of normal curvature of hypersurface.also we define the tangential pressure in terms of the normal curvature and surface tension tensor . in section 4,we",
    "establish the absence of delta -like energy flows across the surface , for our choice of phenomenological representaion of negative tangential pressure on the surface layer which is @xmath4 here .",
    "also we derive a relationship between the surface tension tensor of the hypersurface and the energy- momentum tensor of the enveloping surface.here we also prove that for weak field approximation and atleast for static spherically symmetric configuration of constant radii , our expression for pressure difference across the surface layer reduces to the classical kelvin s relation between pressure difference across the surface , surface tension and the mean curvature.in the last part of this section , we write a modified action for the boundary.this action has contribitions both from the normal curvature as well as the surface tension term of the hypersurface , which represents the surface layer.we also propose a method to calculate the physical action assuming a reference background , where the background is not flat .",
