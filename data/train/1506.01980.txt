    "the asymmetric exclusion process ( asep ) is a model of interacting particles introduced in biology and mathematics in the late 1960 s @xcite .",
    "the particles may hop to the right and left in a finite lattice of cells and enter and exit at the boundaries of the lattice , with the exclusion condition which means there can be at most one particle in each cell . in the most general model ,",
    "five parameters determine the hopping probabilities for the particles . in the bulk",
    ", the probability of hopping left is @xmath1 times the probability of hopping right .",
    "the four other parameters refer to the probabilities for a particle to enter and exit at the left and right boundaries of the lattice .",
    "this model has attracted considerable attention in physics , and in particular is treated as a toy model in the study of dynamical systems far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "the asep can be solved completely in the general case ( i.e.  there are explicit formulas for the stationary probabilities ) and it exhibits boundary - induced phase transitions .",
    "a seminal tool is the so - called matrix ansatz of derrida , evans , hakim and pasquier @xcite .    in the past ten years",
    ", much work has been done in combinatorics in relation to the asep .",
    "most notably , the stationary probabilities can be interpreted as a weighted sum over certain combinatorial objects . the main starting point for the combinatorial interpretations",
    "was the asep with three parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath1 , i.e.  the partially asymmetric exclusion process ( pasep ) ( this is the same model as the asep , except that some parameters are set to 0 ) . in this process , particles can enter the lattice on the left with probability proportional to @xmath2 and exit at the right with probability proportional to @xmath3 , and hop right or left inside the strip with probabilities proportional to 1 and @xmath1 respectively . in relation with the matrix ansatz @xcite",
    ", various authors have introduced several equivalent combinatorial objects such as _ permutation tableaux , alternative tableaux , staircase tableaux , and tree - like tableaux _ , all enumerated by @xmath4 and thus in bijection with permutations . in the case",
    "where @xmath5 ( tasep ) , the corresponding tableaux are enumerated by catalan numbers .",
    "a very rich area of combinatorics has emerged from this topic .",
    "the pasep has also been generalized to allow different species of particles , with some priority rules where particles can swap with particles of different species .",
    "again , some combinatorial interpretations are starting to be discovered , using an extended matrix ansatz . in this paper",
    "we consider a simple two - species pasep with three parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath1 , analogous to the ordinary pasep ( see @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the first author studied the case of the two - species pasep for @xmath5 , and introduced an object called the `` multi - catalan tableau '' that gives an interpretation for the steady state probabilities of the process for that special case . in this work",
    ", we generalize the result for all @xmath1 with a new object called the rhombic alternative tableaux .",
    "more specifically , the two - species pasep has two species of particles , one heavy and one light .",
    "the `` heavy '' particle can enter the lattice on the left with rate @xmath2 , and exit the lattice on the right with rate @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , the `` heavy '' particle can swap places with both the `` hole '' and the `` light '' particle when they are adjacent , and similarly the `` light '' particle can swap places with the `` hole '' .",
    "each of these possible swaps occur at rate 1 when the heavier particle is to the left of the lighter one , and at rate @xmath1 when the heavier particle is to the right ( we simplify our notation by treating the `` hole '' as a third type of `` particle '' ) .",
    "more precisely , if we denote the `` heavy '' particle by @xmath6 , the `` light '' particle by @xmath7 , and the `` hole '' by @xmath8 , and let @xmath9 and @xmath10 be any words in @xmath11 then the transitions of this process are : @xmath12    @xmath13    where by @xmath14 we mean that the transition from @xmath9 to @xmath10 has probability @xmath15 , @xmath0 being the length of @xmath9 ( and also @xmath10 ) .",
    "notice that since only the `` heavy '' particle can enter or exit the lattice , the number of `` light '' particles must stay fixed .",
    "in particular , if we fix the number of `` light '' particles to be 0 , we recover the original pasep .",
    "uchiyama provides a matrix ansatz along with matrices that satisfy the conditions , to express the stationary probabilities of the two - species pasep as certain matrix products .",
    "[ ansatz ] let @xmath16 with @xmath17 for @xmath18 represent a state of the two - species pasep of length @xmath0 with @xmath19 `` light '' particles .",

    "<S> we study a two - species pasep , in which there are two types of particles , `` heavy '' and `` light '' , hopping right and left on a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath0 cells with open boundaries . in this process </S>",
    "<S> , only the `` heavy '' particles can enter on the left of the lattice and exit from the right of the lattice . in the bulk , any transition where a heavier particle type swaps places with an adjacent lighter particle type is possible . </S>",
    "<S> we generalize combinatorial results of corteel and williams for the ordinary pasep by defining a combinatorial object which we call a rhombic alternative tableau that gives a combinatorial formula for the stationary probabilities for the states of this two - species pasep .     + olya mandelshtam and xavier viennot </S>"
