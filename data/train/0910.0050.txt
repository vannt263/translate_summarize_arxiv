    "real quantum systems unavoidably interact with their surroundings undergoing a consequent decoherence and entanglement loss @xcite .",
    "it is known that two entangled qubits embedded in markovian ( memoryless ) environments may become completely disentangled at a finite time , in spite of an exponential decay of the single qubit coherence @xcite .",
    "this entanglement sudden death ( esd , or early - stage disentanglement ) which has been experimentally revealed @xcite , puts a serious limit to the storage times of entanglement for practical purposes , e.g. , for the realization of quantum memory banks @xcite .",
    "a realistic quantum computer will probably have to take into account this quantum dynamical drawback .",
    "it is therefore important to study the possibile physical conditions where entanglement can be maintained .",
    "entanglement losses during the evolution crucially depend on the particular noise acting on the system . under markovian - noise conditions",
    "the quantum process is typically irreversible .",
    "differently , structured environments or strong coupling can give rise to non - markovian noise ( environment with memory ) whose effects on the entanglement dynamics is currently subjected to investigation @xcite . in this context , the cases of two noninteracting qubits embedded either in separated high-@xmath0 cavities @xcite or in a common cavity @xcite supporting a mode resonant with the qubit transition frequency have been analyzed , finding that revivals of the initial two - qubit entanglement can occur .",
    "when the qubits share a common environment , it has been also shown that entanglement can be preserved by means of quantum zeno effect @xcite . moreover , entanglement trapping is achievable when two independent qubits are embedded in an ideal photonic - band gap ( pbg ) material ( photonic crystal ) @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is therefore to deepen the analysis of entanglement evolution in non - markovian environments , considering in particular two different effective spectral conditions of the environment - qubit system simulating , respectively , a cavity with a mode slightly off - resonant with the qubit transition frequency and a nonperfect photonic band - gap at the qubit transition frequency . in this paper",
    "we highlight the differences with previous studies and we discuss the optimal physical parameters for observing entanglement revivals and for preservation of entanglement .",
    "we consider a system composed by two parts @xmath1 , each one consisting of a two - level system ( qubit ) @xmath2 interacting with a reservoir @xmath3 .",

    "for @xmath36 these states coincide with the bell states .",
    "bell - like states have the property that their resulting density matrix has an x structure ( only diagonal and antidiagonal density matrix elements different from zero ) . under our dynamical conditions , the x structure is maintained during the two - qubit evolution , so that the two - qubit density matrix at time @xmath26 will also have a x structure .      in order to quantify the entanglement during the evolution of the bipartite system , we use the concurrence @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the concurrence at the time @xmath26 for an initial general x state can be easily computed by exploiting the fact that the x structure is preserved here and by using eqs .",

    "we shall now analyze the evolution of concurrence for two different spectral densities : a single lorentzian simulating a cavity with a mode nonresonant with the qubit transition frequency and a nonperfect photonic band - gap at the qubit transition frequency .      as a first example we take the spectral distribution @xmath20 of the electromagnetic field inside a high-@xmath0 cavity supporting a mode detuned by @xmath39 from the qubit ( two - level atom ) transition frequency @xmath7 , resulting from the combination of the environment spectrum and the system - environment coupling .",
