    "our present knowledge of neutrino masses and mixing is mainly provided by various neutrino oscillation experiments , which give us information on the two independent mass squared differences , as well as on the three angles characterizing the leptonic mixing matrix . in the future , the study of @xmath3 violation in neutrino oscillations may allow to determine the dirac - type phase entering in the leptonic mixing matrix , and neutrinoless double @xmath4 decay experiments may provide the value of the effective majorana mass . despite the great achievements of oscillation experiments , there is still much to be learned about neutrinos .",
    "one of the most problematic issues in neutrino physics is the lack of information on the mass spectrum , since the mass squared differences do not fix the absolute scale of neutrino masses . indeed , the spectrum can exhibit a strong hierarchy , as in the case of quarks and charged leptons , or on the contrary , be quasi - degenerate .    at present",
    ", there are different extensions of the standard model ( sm ) which propose mechanisms for the generation of neutrino masses through the enlargement of the sm particle content .",
    "the addition of heavy right - handed neutrino singlets constitutes a simple and economical way to give left - handed neutrinos small masses through the seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "another simple possibility relies on the extension of the scalar sector with a heavy @xmath5 triplet , with or without supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite . within supersymmetric models",
    ", neutrino masses can also arise from @xmath6-parity violating interactions @xcite , where the atmospheric and solar neutrino mass scales are generated at the tree level and radiatively , respectively .",
    "recently , a new supersymmetric source of neutrino masses and mixings has been found considering non - renormalizable lepton number violating interactions in the khler potential @xcite rather than in the effective superpotential .",
    "all the above scenarios predict the existence of light majorana massive neutrinos .",
    "suppressed dirac neutrino masses are unnatural in conventional theories since they usually require extremely small yukawa couplings",
    ". however , this problem can be surmounted by endowing the particle content of the theory with extra fermion or scalar fields and/or introducing new symmetries @xcite .",
    "naturally small dirac neutrino masses also arise in extra - dimensional theories as a consequence of the small overlap between the wavefunctions of the usual left - handed neutrinos in the brane and the sterile right - handed ones in the bulk ( or in other branes ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to the mechanism for the generation of neutrino masses , one of the most intriguing aspects of leptonic physics is the experimental evidence that two of the lepton mixing angles are large , in contrast to the small mixing observed in the quark sector .",
    "the deep understanding of the neutrino mass suppression mechanism and the bi - large leptonic mixing constitutes one of the most challenging questions in particle physics .",
    "a theory of leptonic flavor should provide a plausible explanation for the bi - large mixing , as well as for the neutrino mass spectrum . at the same time",
    ", it should predict relations among these quantities .",
    "there have been in the literature a large number of suggestions in this direction , consisting in the introduction of flavor symmetries or the assumption of specific textures for the leptonic mass matrices @xcite .",
    "the tree - level predictions of any theory of leptonic flavor are subject to higher order corrections , which are computable if the particle content and parameters of the new physics model are specified .",
    "still , in the absence of a `` standard theory '' of lepton flavor , it is pertinent to ask ourselves about the possible consequences of the ( unknown ) radiative corrections on the tree - level predictions of the model .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate these effects , focusing on : ( i ) the modification of the tree - level values for the ratio of mass squared differences , mixing angles and cp violation parameters ; ( ii ) the effect on various flavor relations .",
    "this task will be carried out in two steps .",
    "we will first propose a parametrization for the unknown radiative corrections to the lepton mass matrices , based on rather general arguments on weak - basis independence .",
    "in this parametrization , the formal structure of the corrections is fixed , up to undetermined complex coefficients . then , the possible effects of the radiative corrections is investigated taking these coefficients as random , and performing a statistical analysis of the average behavior of the parameters and flavor relations under consideration .",
    "it is important to note here the difference between our framework and other studies in the literature regarding random neutrino matrices @xcite .",
    "in these analyses , the neutrino mass matrices are taken as random at the tree level , with a subsequent discussion of the predictions for the neutrino mass spectrum and mixing angles .",
    "in contrast with this approach , in this paper we take the tree - level charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices as fixed by some theory of leptonic flavor , and consider random perturbations ( from radiative corrections ) to them @xcite .",
    "these corrections are not completely arbitrary : the different terms of the perturbations must have a determined formal structure ( which is dictated by weak basis independence ) but have random coefficients .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we briefly review the current status of neutrino oscillation data .",
    "the parametrization of the unknown corrections to the lepton mass matrices is derived in section [ sec:3 ] . in section [ sec:4 ]",
    "we present our results , discussing ( i ) the effect of perturbations on masses and mixing parameters ; ( ii ) the influence on some flavor relations obtained for some specific patterns in the literature ; ( iii ) the consequences of the corrections in some special limits of interest .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section [ sec:5 ] .",
    "all presently available neutrino oscillation data can be accommodated within the framework of three mixed massive neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the first kamland results @xcite select the large mixing angle msw solution as the only surviving explanation for the solar neutrino problem .",
    "in addition , dominant solar neutrino conversion based on non - oscillation solutions are now excluded @xcite .",
    "recently , the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) has released the improved measurements of the salt enhanced phase @xcite which , together with all the solar and kamland neutrino data , allow for a better determination of the oscillation parameters . in particular , the high-@xmath7 region ( @xmath8 ) is now only accepted at the @xmath9 level and maximal solar mixing is ruled out by more than @xmath10 , rejecting in this way the possibility of bi - maximal leptonic mixing @xcite . concerning the atmospheric neutrino sector , the water cherenkov super - kamiokande ( sk ) @xcite and long - baseline kek - to - kamioka ( k2k ) @xcite experiments indicate that neutrino flavor conversion due to neutrino oscillations in the @xmath11 channel provide by far the most acceptable and natural explanation for the observed @xmath12 disappearance .    regarding the absolute values of neutrino masses , the situation is not so satisfactory . at present ,",

    "we adopt the neutrino mass ordering @xmath15 in such a way that , for the hierarchical ( hi ) , inverted - hierarchical ( ih ) and quasi - degenerate ( qd ) neutrino mass spectra one has @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the solar and atmospheric neutrino mass squared differences , respectively . at the @xmath19 level ,",

    "our aim is to investigate whether these quantities are stable or not , and to what extent they get modified by the perturbations .",
    "we first present the results for scenario 1 , and later discuss the differences with scenario 2 and the results for dirac neutrinos .    regarding the ratio of mass squared differences @xmath57",
    ", we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : r ] that the corrections to the matrices have a large impact on this quantity , both in the cases of a hi or qd spectrum .",
    "this plot ( and the remaining ones in this section ) must be interpreted with caution : it does not provide any limit on the size of the corrections , on the basis of the experimental measurement of @xmath57 , because the initial `` tree - level '' value we use for @xmath57 needs not be equal to the observed value .",
    "instead , the meaning of the plot is that @xmath57 is not stable under perturbations , and from an initial value chosen to be @xmath58 one can obtain values between 0.021 and 0.034 , for a hi spectrum and @xmath59 .",
    "the effect of the perturbations on @xmath2 is quite different for a hi or qd spectrum . in the former case",
    ", @xmath60 is very stable even for relatively large perturbations , as can be noticed in fig .",
    "[ fig : tan12 ] . on the contrary , for quasi - degenerate neutrinos ,",
    "the value of @xmath2 can change significantly with new physics corrections .",
    "this fact suggests that , if neutrinos are quasi - degenerate , the underlying tree - level pattern of lepton mass matrices could correspond to bi - maximal mixing , being the observed value @xmath61 the result of radiative corrections .",
    "we will analyze in detail this possibility at the end of this section .",
    "the behavior of @xmath1 is the opposite to the one observed for @xmath2 , as it can be perceived from fig .",
    "[ fig : tan23 ] : for a hi spectrum this parameter is modified by perturbations on the mass matrices , while for a qd spectrum it is fairly stable .",
    "this shows that , for the case of quasi - degenerate neutrinos , the experimental observation of @xmath62 must correspond to @xmath63 in the mass matrices , because this prediction is not altered by the corrections .",
    "on the other hand , for a hi spectrum the observation of @xmath62 could be either a coincidence , or result from a specific symmetry leading naturally to this value and making higher order corrections very small .",
    "the analysis of @xmath56 ( which equals @xmath64 for a normal hierarchy ) shows that it does not change under perturbations for a qd spectrum , but it is considerably modified when the neutrino masses are hierarchical ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : v13 ] ) . however , one striking feature of our analysis is that the ratio @xmath65 remains practically constant even when large perturbations are added to @xmath50 and @xmath66 : for @xmath67 @xmath56 and @xmath1 change by more than @xmath68% , while their ratio changes less than 1% , as can be noticed in fig .",
    "[ fig : omega ] .",
    "this feature may have important consequences for model building .",
    "when @xmath56 is experimentally measured , the ratio @xmath69 will be an excellent tool to investigate the structure of the lepton mass matrices , because it is very insensitive to radiative corrections ( as long as these corrections do not have any additional source of flavor violation , which is the framework we consider ) .",
    "this ratio will then allow to test experimentally , with a `` clean '' observable , the textures for lepton mass matrices implied by flavor symmetries proposed in the literature .",
    "the remaining parameters to be investigated are the @xmath3 violating phases , for which the results depend on the initial values used ( see table  [ tab:1 ] ) . for a hi spectrum",

    "the majorana phases remain within @xmath72% of their initial value for @xmath67 , while the dirac phase varies in the interval @xmath73 .    in scenario 2 ,",
    "the behavior is very different for a hi spectrum . in this case",
    ", we find that @xmath57 , @xmath2 , @xmath1 , @xmath56 and the three @xmath3 violating phases remain constant when the perturbations in eqs .",

    "these quantities exhibit a similar behavior under rg evolution @xcite , as its expressions are formally identical to ours . on the other hand , in the case of a qd spectrum ,",
    "the differences between scenarios 1 and 2 are not significant , and the discussion above applies also to scenario 2 .",
    "this contrast can be understood in view of the analysis of the dependence on the neutrino masses presented in section [ sec:4.2 ] below .    for dirac neutrinos ,",
    "the results are found to be rather similar to the ones obtained in scenario 2 . for a hi spectrum the parameters under consideration do not change when the perturbations in eqs .",
    "( [ ec:3.15 ] ) are included .",
    "for a qd spectrum , however , they are modified , following practically the same behavior that can be observed in the plots for scenario 1 shown in this section .",
    "finally , we note that the results on @xmath57 , @xmath2 and @xmath74 are almost independent on the value of @xmath56 used .",
    "other quantities obviously depend on the particular value of @xmath56 , as for example @xmath75 , which is proportional to @xmath56 .",
    "the choice of the @xmath3-violating phases is only relevant for the `` tree - level '' values of quantities that depend on them , like @xmath75 and @xmath76 . for a qd spectrum ,",
    "the deviations of @xmath57 , @xmath2 , @xmath1 , @xmath56 and @xmath69 are very similar , and for a hi spectrum the influence of phases on these quantities is completely negligible .",
    "we have also checked that our results do not change when the next terms in the expansion of eqs .",
    "( [ ec:3.9 ] ) ( with products of 5 matrices ) are included , even in the unrealistic limit where these terms have similar coefficients .",
    "we have found that the quantities that are stable remain stable , and the quantities that change under perturbations exhibit an analogous behavior with the inclusion of these terms .",
    "we have verified that the influence of the perturbations on some parameters depends strongly on the type of neutrino spectrum , namely the deviations of @xmath60 are negligible for a hi spectrum while they are large if the neutrinos are quasi - degenerate .",
    "it is then convenient to analyze the dependence of the deviations on the mass of the lightest neutrino , which we take between @xmath77 ev and 2.2 ev ( the direct bound from the mainz and troitsk experiments ) . in figs .",
    "[ fig : r - m][fig : v13-m ] we plot the effect of the corrections on @xmath57 , @xmath2 , @xmath74 and @xmath56 , respectively , for @xmath59 .",
    "it is apparent that these parameters are remarkably more stable in the region around @xmath78 ev than for the rest of values of @xmath79 .",
    "this can be understood as follows : the only two terms that influence the mixing are @xmath80 and @xmath81 . of these ,",
    "the former is relevant only for a hi spectrum , whereas for a qd spectrum it does not have any influence . on the contrary ,",
    "the latter term is important for a qd spectrum but its impact is negligible if the neutrino masses are hierarchical .",
    "hence , the deviations in @xmath1 and @xmath82 appearing in the left part of figs .",
    "[ fig : tan23-m ] and [ fig : v13-m ] are due to the @xmath83 term , and the deviations in @xmath6 , @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath56 that can be seen in the right side of figs .",
    "[ fig : r - m][fig : v13-m ] are a consequence of the @xmath84 term . the deviations in @xmath57 in the left hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : r - m ] is an effect of the @xmath85 term , which does not contribute to the mixing .",
    "the region @xmath86 ev is of special interest , since these neutrino masses will be probed in forthcoming experiments like katrin , which is planned to start in 2007 .",
    "if the mass of the lightest neutrino happens to be in this range , this will mean that the corrections to the tree - level mass matrices will have a much smaller impact on the hierarchy of mass squared differences and the mixing .",
    "the same is also true for the dirac and majorana phases . for completeness , in fig .",
    "[ fig : omega - m ] we show the @xmath19 limits on @xmath69 for the same range of @xmath79 .",
    "we observe that this ratio remains virtually constant in the whole interval .    for scenario 2 and for dirac neutrinos ,",
    "the dependence on the lightest neutrino mass is much simpler . for a hi spectrum , all the quantities studied are stable , and in these cases the effects of perturbations are as in figs .",
    "[ fig : r - m][fig : omega - m ] but without the deviations present in the left part of some of these plots .",
    "we are interested in finding flavor relations which are stable under perturbations of the mass matrices . by `` stability ''",
    "we mean that , if these relations hold for the tree - level matrices , they still hold to a good approximation when perturbations are added . with some exceptions , most flavor relations found in the literature correspond to majorana neutrinos with a hi spectrum . in scenario 2 ,",

    "[ fig : rel2 ] that the accuracy of the second relation is hardly affected by perturbations on the mass matrices .",

    "<S> we introduce a parametrization of the effects of radiative corrections from new physics on the charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices , studying how several relevant quantities describing the pattern of neutrino masses and mixing are affected by these corrections . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the ratio @xmath0 is remarkably stable , even when relatively large corrections are added to the original mass matrices . </S>",
    "<S> it is also found that if the lightest neutrino has a mass around 0.3 ev , the pattern of masses and mixings is considerably more stable under perturbations than for a lighter or heavier spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the consequences of perturbations on some flavor relations given in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , for a quasi - degenerate neutrino spectrum it is shown that : ( i ) starting from a bi - maximal mixing scenario , the corrections to the mass matrices keep @xmath1 very close to unity while they can lower @xmath2 to its measured value ; ( ii ) beginning from a scenario with a vanishing dirac phase , corrections can induce a dirac phase large enough to yield @xmath3 violation observable in neutrino oscillations . </S>"
