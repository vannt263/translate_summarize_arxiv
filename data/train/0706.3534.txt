    "when a liquid is cooled below its melting temperature , crystallisation can often be avoided by a fast enough cooling , and the liquid enters a phase , called supercooled @xcite .",
    "the supercooled phase is _ metastable _ , it has a finite lifetime and it is unstable with respect to large fluctuations although those characteristics are not a practical limitation : metastable states are ubiquitous in nature and in technology ( see references in @xcite ) , and not distinct from stable states under many practical respects .",
    "metastability , as a general concept , is present in many fields of physics , from superconductivity to high - energy physics ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the understanding of metastability is crucial in the context of the study of the glass - transition @xcite : the structural glass transition occurs , during the cooling process , at a certain temperature below which the liquid falls out - of - equilibrium and forms the structural glass , unstable with respect to the metastable phase .",
    "however , and despite of its ubiquity and intrinsic theoretical interest , metastability is still not well understood , and a lot of theoretical effort has been given on the problem in the last decades @xcite .",
    "+ from a purely thermodynamic point of view , metastable states satisfy the callen minimum energy principle , but only with respect to small enough fluctuations . in the thermodynamic space @xmath3 of field variables , where @xmath4 is the temperature and @xmath5 is the pressure , in the case of a fluid , or the magnetic field , in the case of a magnet , the metastable phase is described by a free energy @xmath6 in a region of @xmath3 space in which it coexists with the stable phase , described by @xmath7 , and it is : @xmath8 .",
    "metastable states satisfy the local stability condition , @xmath9 , which is a necessary , but not sufficient condition for stable equilibrium : it only guarantees the stability with respect to infinitesimal fluctuations .",
    "metastable states are not stable with respect to a large enough fluctuation : the system would prefer indeed the equilibrium phase at @xmath3 described by @xmath7 since @xmath10 .",
    "+ statistical mechanics of systems in mean field approximation , as the landau theory of magnetism or the van der waals equation of state for the gas - liquid condensation , accounts for metastable phases , which , in this context , exhibit the thermodynamic properties described above . in mean field , the only allowed form of fluctuation is a spatially uniform change of the order parameter , @xmath11 , and the free energy cost of such a change is extensive in the volume . for this reason ,",
    "the free energy barriers separating the relative minima of the free energy functional in @xmath12 space from the absolute minima , the stable phase , are infinite in the thermodynamic limit , and , hence , the corresponding metastable states would have an infinite lifetime . + when fluctuations are taken into account , however , statistical mechanics of short - range interaction systems can not account properly for metastability , since , when the thermodynamic limit is taken , the partition function in ensemble theory is dominated by the global minimum of the free energy functional in phase space .",
    "metastable states being not ergodic , they are not well - described by the partition function ; for them , temporal averages are not equivalent to the ensemble average . beyond mean field",
    ", there always exist a finite probability of surmounting the free energy density barriers in phase space by a local nucleation process and , hence , it is not possible to state whether a given distribution is metastable without making reference to a timescale , related in some way to the mentioned probability of nucleation @xcite .",
    "+ an alternative is the dynamic description of metastability @xcite , which is characterized by a two - step relaxation during the dynamic evolution of the system in the coexistence region . the two - step relaxation is associated with two times ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) , such that the order parameter and other observables are quasi - stationary in time in the interval @xmath15 ) . for systems with discrete phase space ,",
    "nucleation times can be computed by the numerical solution of a master equation describing their temporal evolution , as pioneered by binder for the ising model @xcite .",
    "+ although this dynamic definition of metastability is apparently different from the thermodynamic picture mentioned above , there exist connections between the partition function - based methods and the dynamic considerations @xcite .",
    "the most relevant is probably the result by langer @xcite , who shows that , for a wide class of models , whose dynamics can be described by a fokker - plank equation , the nucleation rate , @xmath16 , ( the number of nucleation events per unit time and volume ) can be written under certain limits as :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the inverse temperature , the prefactor @xmath19 contains all dependence on the specific dynamics , and @xmath20 is the imaginary part of the ( divergent ) analytical continuation of the equilibrium free energy density in the region of @xmath3 corresponding to the ordered state .",
    "this puts into relation and generalizes several other previous results , as the arrhenius - like relation @xmath21 between the nucleation rate and the free energy cost , @xmath22 , of the formation of a ` critical droplet ' , in the context of classical nucleation theory @xcite , giving also the expression for @xmath23 from first - principles .",
    "+ there are also other connections between ` static ' and dynamic approaches to metastability , as the result by penrose for the droplet model of condensation @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , a gas of non - interacting droplets of all possible sizes . if the partition function is restricted to consider only undercritical clusters , nucleation is avoided , and analytic continuations of stable isotherms in the metastable region can be computed . the resulting free energy , morover , coincides with @xmath24 , and also the langer relation between @xmath20 and @xmath25 holds when the becker - dring dynamic is considered for the droplets @xcite .",
    "+ even if the result ( [ langer ] ) by langer has been proved for several models ( see references in @xcite ) , no general proof exists , and its validity is unclear @xcite .",
    "in particular , the identity ( [ langer ] ) has been proved @xcite for the field - driven transition of the ising model below the critical temperature and in the limit of small field , computing @xmath26 from a droplet expansion .",
    "+ for this model it has been shown the equivalence between both types of calculations of @xmath25 , using the field - theoretical calculus of @xmath26 , and the solution of the master equation with the monte - carlo method @xcite .",
    "this agreement has been extensively further studied for the ising model @xcite .",
    "lattice models are particularly suitable for this comparison since , on the one hand , it is possible to compute numerically nucleation rates , and , on the other hand , their critical properties and surface tension are often known exactly , which makes possible an analytical droplet expansion calculus .",
    "morover , as mentioned in @xcite , the concept of droplet is for them unambiguously defined . +",
    "a similar droplet expansion computation of the free energy has been done in 2000 by meunier and morel @xcite for the study of the first - order transition of one of the better known lattice models in equilibrium statistical mechanics : the @xmath0-color potts model ( @xmath0-pm ) with @xmath27 @xcite . for finite - size systems , a free energy barrier is found , associated with a metastable state , in a given temperature range , which is shown , however , to shrink to zero in the thermodynamic limit . to our knowledge , the present work is the first attempt to contrast the results of meunier and morel with a dynamic computation , as they suggest to do .",
    "+ nevertheless , the dynamics associated with the @xmath0-pm transition has already been studied @xcite , and it is itself a topic of relevance . in @xcite metastability in the field - driven transition of the 2d @xmath0-pm is studied .",
    "numerical results suggest the existence of a dynamic metastable phase associated with the temperature - driven transition for @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xcite , even if such a metastable phase is not analysed quantitatively . for this transition hysteresis cycles",
    "are studied numerically , in @xcite , and it is concluded that relaxation through the equilibrium state occurs via nucleation .",
    "+ in this work we present some results on the dynamic metastability of the @xmath0-pm in the lattice , emphasyzing its dependence on the lattice size , up to a linear size @xmath32 . in the next section",
    "we introduce the model and our notation , the previous results of the droplet expansion @xcite and of the mean field approximation for the model . in section [ dynamic ] we present and interpret the results from the dynamics , together with the finite - size analysis , and compare them with those introduced in section [ droplet ] .",
    "section [ conclusions ] is to conclude and summarize .",

    "both transitions occur at a critical inverse temperature @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath418,12,24-color potts models we study are , thus , 2d - lattice models , with short - range two - body interactions and which presents a first - order temperature - driven transition at @xmath42 .",

    "the absolute minimum is no longer the disordered state , but there still exists a local minimum at @xmath50 , which can be associated to an undercooled , metastable disordered state , and which survives in the temperature range @xmath52 since , in this interval , it is @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "+ the droplet expansion performed in @xcite predicts , however , a disappearance of the metastable range in the thermodynamic limit . the free energy of the disordered phase is computed from the following series , in which each term is the free energy of clusters of area @xmath55 ( @xcite ) :    @xmath56    being @xmath57 the interface tension and @xmath58 non - geometrical exponents discussed in the work . replacing the discrete sum by an integral , and making certain assumptions on the form of the inteface tension from previous known results , an expression for the free energy of the disordered phase is found and compared with numerical data for the free energy cumulants . from this free energy and for finite - size systems of area @xmath59 , a probability distribution , @xmath60 , for the energy at the critical point",

    "metastability is characterized by a barrier separating the local and global maxima of @xmath66 , which ends at its local minima , and by a `` spinodal temperature '' below which the barrier dissapears . due to the singular behavior of the free energy at @xmath67 , @xmath68 is strongly size dependent for @xmath69 and @xmath70 lower than the equilibrium energy at @xmath67 , and this fact leads to a shrinking of the metastable range to zero for large sizes : the spinodal temperature converges to @xmath67 . + in subsection [ finite ] we compare the properties of this spinodal temperature with the one we find in our dynamic analysis .",

    "+ the fast vanishing of the metastable regime presented here can be understood as a call to caution when interpreting hysteresis cycles performed for the @xmath0-pm in past or future articles : if the step in @xmath83 , @xmath179 of the cooling at a rate @xmath180 is larger than the corresponding size - dependent metastable interval @xmath181 , then none of the points of the hysterisis dyagram would correspond to metastable states , but rather to heterogeneous , non - equilibrium configurations , which have already nucleated .",
