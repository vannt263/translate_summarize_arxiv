    "the interest for novel frustrated layered compounds stems from their compelling magnetic properties , which attract applied as well as basic science oriented research . in case of a strong ferromagnetic ( fm ) intralayer exchange and a weak antiferromagnetic ( afm ) interlayer coupling , the magnetic ground state of afm arranged fm layers can be easily broken by external magnetic fields , which enable simple switching between zero and maximum magnetization .",

    "@xcite such systems are often described by models on the two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattice with spin dimensionality @xmath10=1 ( ising ) , @xmath10=2 ( xy ) or @xmath10=3 ( heisenberg),@xcite which are interesting also from the theoretical point of view .",

    "@xcite yet , real materials are usually more complex .",
    "frequently the planar rotational symmetry is imperfect , leading to a quasi xy behavior .",
    "the inter - plane exchange coupling is often sufficiently strong to induce 3d ordering , so also spatially such systems are only quasi 2d . finally , layered systems , particularly frustrated ones , @xcite are highly susceptible to small external perturbations @xcite allowing to sweep across spin- and space- degrees of freedom.@xcite     and ( b ) @xmath11 projections of the cu@xmath0bi(seo@xmath0)@xmath1o@xmath1br crystal layer . for clarity",
    "the @xmath3 projection is slightly canted . here the magnetic cu1 and cu2 ions are indicated as small blue and red spheres , respectively ; o ions are the smallest violet spheres in the corners of cuo@xmath12 plackets , bi ions are intermediate light pink spheres , se ions are larger light green spheres , and br ions are the largest dark green spheres.,width=340,height=377 ]    a novel layered compound with seemingly frustrated magnetic lattice is cu@xmath0bi(seo@xmath0)@xmath1o@xmath1br .",
    "this compound is orthorhombic ( space group @xmath13 ) with crystal lattice parameters @xmath8=6.390 , @xmath6=9.694 and @xmath5=7.287 .",
    "@xcite it is built of two different types of [ cuo@xmath12 ] square plackets , sharing apices to form copper - oxygen layers reminiscent of a buckled kagom lattice of the magnetic cu@xmath15 ( @xmath16=@xmath17 ) ions ( fig.[figcryst ] ) , with cu1 and cu2 positioned at ( 000 ) and ( @xmath18@xmath18@xmath19 , @xmath19=0.791 ) , i.e. , at the 4(c ) and the 2(a ) sites , respectively .",
    "hence , in case of the afm nearest - neighbor interactions , cu@xmath15 spins should be exposed to a strong geometrical frustration . however , additional cu - o-@xmath20-o - cu ( @xmath20=se , bi ) super - superexchange interactions might be important,@xcite as the [ cuo@xmath12 ] plackets are linked also by se@xmath21 and bi@xmath22 ions ( fig.[figcryst ] ) .",
    "in fact , bi@xmath22 enables additional cu1-o - bi - o - cu1 next - nearest - neighbor interaction along the @xmath6 axis , whereas se@xmath21 provides only an alternative to the already recognized cu - o - cu nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "finally , since both , se@xmath21 and bi@xmath22 , possess lone pair electrons and thus effectively reduce the number of chemical bonds , @xcite the only probable interlayer coupling is through a long bi@xmath22-o bond",

    "interestingly , though the ratio between the interlayer and the effective intralayer couplings is significant , @xmath28@xmath250.006 , and the magnetic anisotropy represents only @xmath2520% of @xmath29 , the low temperature experimental data sustain a quasi 2d xy behavior .",

    "magnetization ( @xmath31 ) and dc susceptibility ( @xmath32 ) measurements were performed in commercial mpms and ppms magnetometers in the temperature range 1.8k - 400k and applied magnetic fields up to 8 t. + neutron diffraction experiments were performed at swiss neutron spallation source sinq , paul scherrer institute , switzerland .",
    "powder diffraction patterns were collected between 1.5k and 60k on the dmc powder diffractometer with neutron wavelength @xmath33 = 2.46  .",
    "single crystal diffraction was performed in the temperature range between 6.5k and 300k on the trics single crystal diffractometer ( @xmath33 = 1.18  ) .",
    "the zero - field data collection was performed in a cooling machine mounted on a 4-circle cradle , for the magnetic field measurement a vertical field cryomagnet ( oxford instruments ) and normal beam geometry were used .",
    "compared to earlier reported powder magnetic susceptibility data measured in a magnetic field of 1 t , @xcite our single crystal results reveal new anisotropic properties of cu@xmath0bi(seo@xmath0)@xmath1o@xmath1br . in fact , we find that the magnetic susceptibility is very anisotropic and highly sensitive to the strength of the applied magnetic field .",
    "when an external magnetic field of 0.01 t is applied perpendicular to the layers ( @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 can be described by a cw law with @xmath36=80(5)k down to 200k , where the slope of 1/@xmath35 starts to decrease ( inset in fig.[figchibpac]a ) .",

    "we note that the difference in 1/@xmath35 and 1/@xmath38 slopes suggests different @xmath40-factors , as curie constant @xmath41@xmath42@xmath43,@xcite while the discrepancy between @xmath44 and @xmath39 implies a sizable ( @xmath2520% ) exchange anisotropy.@xcite    a much more anisotropic response is observed below the magnetic transition ( for @xmath45@xmath46@xmath2=27.4k ) , where a typical afm behavior is observed at low fields ( fig.[figchibpac]a ) . for @xmath34",
    "the anomaly in @xmath35 is very sharp i.e. , @xmath47 drops below 0.1 already at @xmath48@xmath250.85 , which implies that the magnetic ground state is afm and that the @xmath5-axis is the orientation favored by the magnetic moments .",
    "considering now that the anomalies in @xmath49 and @xmath50 are significantly less pronounced and that @xmath51 is smaller than @xmath52 , we can deduce that the magnetic moments are more easily bent towards @xmath6 than towards @xmath8 .",
    "thus we can conclude that cu@xmath0bi(seo@xmath0)@xmath1o@xmath1br is an afm with magnetic moments predominately lying along the @xmath5-axis , @xmath8 coincides with the magnetic hard axis and @xmath6 is somewhere in - between .",
    "when the applied magnetic field @xmath34 exceeds 0.5 t , the anomaly in @xmath35 starts to broaden and shift to lower temperatures ( fig.[figchibpac]b ) .",
    "eventually , at 1 t , @xmath35 exhibits saturation - like behavior , indicating that the low - field ( lf ) afm ground state is followed by a high - field ( hf ) ferri- or ferromagnetic phase . on contrary ,",
    "increase of @xmath53@xmath54@xmath5 up to 5 t has almost no effect on @xmath55@xmath46@xmath56 ( not shown ) .",
    "finally , low - temperature ( at 2k ) magnetization @xmath31 was measured along all three crystallographic axes ( inset in fig.[figchibpac]b ) .",
    "a sharp magnetic transition is found for @xmath27=0.8 t with @xmath34 .",
    "the fact that above @xmath27 the value of @xmath31 per cu@xmath15 ion , @xmath57=0.9@xmath58 , is almost constant and very close to 1@xmath58 , expected for the complete magnetization per cu@xmath15 ( @xmath16=@xmath59 ) ion , indicates that we witness a metamagnetic transition from an afm to a ferro / ferrimagnetic state .",
    "a very weak field dependence of @xmath31 above @xmath27 indicates that fully fm state is not reached yet .",
    "this suggests that a small afm component is still present and that significantly stronger magnetic fields are required to overcome the responsible afm interactions . on the other hand , when @xmath53 is applied along the @xmath6-axis ,",
    "the magnetization linearly increases up to 7 t , where it again reaches a saturation value .",
    "similar response is observed also for @xmath60 , where the slope of the magnetization is a bit smaller , implying that saturation is reached at @xmath2515 t .",
    "relatively slow linear response for @xmath61 compared to @xmath62 indicates the presence of the sizable magnetic anisotropy . since the zero - field splitting , imposed by the crystal field ,",
    "is expected to be negligible in the cu@xmath15 ( @xmath16=1/2 ) systems , @xcite we suspect that anisotropic exchange interaction is responsible for the observed behavior  in agreement with the different values of the cw constants ( inset in fig[figchibpac]a ) .        to determine the spin arrangement in the lf and hf states we first performed neutron powder diffraction measurements . the diffraction pattern measured at 60k ( inset in fig.[fig1 ] ) confirms the crystal structure published by millet et al . , @xcite while the patterns collected below 30 k reveal the onset of long - range magnetic order ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "magnetic reflections occur at positions distinct from the nuclear ones , indicating that the magnetic ground state is afm .",
    "indeed , the main magnetic reflections ( 2@xmath63=17.5@xmath30 and 28.5@xmath30 ) can be indexed by the magnetic wave vector * k*=(00@xmath59 ) .        in the next step",

    "such an arrangement suggests dominant fm interactions within the layer , as well as a sizable magnetic anisotropy . yet",
    "the coupling between the layers is afm as presented in fig.[fig3]a .",
    "the temperature dependence of the ( 22@xmath59 ) magnetic reflection ( fig.[fig4]a ) indicates a continuous second order phase transition from the paramagnetic to the lf afm phase .",
    "below 26.6k , i.e. @xmath73/@xmath74 0.04 , the magnetic intensity can be described by @xmath75 with @xmath76@xmath770.23 ( fig.[fig4]d ) , as expected for 2d xy spin systems , @xcite in particular when additional weak in - plane crystal - field anisotropy is present.@xcite the exact @xmath2 was derived by fitting the data in the vicinity of @xmath2 ( fig.[fig4]a ) , where the critical exponent @xmath76 increases to @xmath250.30(2 ) , signifying a crossover from spatial 2d ( n=2 ) to 3d ( n=1 ) behavior .",

    "the results corroborate with the magnetic susceptibility data , i.e. , the applied magnetic field suppresses the lf phase and induces the hf phase . at 0.65 t ( fig.[fig4]b )",
    "the lf phase persists up to @xmath2519k , both phases coexist between 19k and 22k , implying a first - order metamagnetic transition , while between 22k and @xmath2 only the hf phase is left . at 1 t , the lf phase is completely suppressed , while @xmath2=27.4k seems to be field independent .    to determine the hf magnetic structure we collected 40 reflections , from which 17 had significant intensity .",

    "the magnetic properties of cu@xmath0bi(seo@xmath0)@xmath1o@xmath1br presented in this work reflect the low dimensional ( 2d ) nature of its lattice .",
    "this is most evident from the experimentally determined magnetic structures for the lf and hf phases , which indicate that the main magnetic building block of the system is a single layer . in order to understand the observed behavior",
    ", we thus focus here on the individual layer .",
    "the two cu sites have different local symmetries of their square planar [ cuo@xmath12 ] coordination , which might be responsible for the different behavior of cu1 and cu2 magnetic moments .",
    "however , calculation of the exchange charge model of the crystal field around cu@xmath15 ions in the actual surrounding indicates that the zero - field spitting , imposed by the crystal field , is weak,@xcite as expected for @xmath16=1/2 systems .",
    "another source of the observed response , e.g. , magnetic frustration or exchange anisotropy , might lie within the exchange network . in particular , the electron hopping , governing the exchange interaction , appears to be very different for inter- and intra - layer exchange pathways and might also differ between the three exchange pathways within the layer ( see figs.[figcryst ] and [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "two of these are nearest - neighbor ones , involving cu1-o1-cu1 ( @xmath87=3.19 , bond angle @xmath88=111@xmath30 , multiplicity @xmath89=4 ) and cu1-o1-cu2 ( @xmath87=3.27 , @xmath88=113@xmath30 , @xmath89=8 ) superexchange bridges , while the last connects next - nearest - neighbors via the cu1-o1-bi - o1-cu1 ( @xmath87=4.84 , @xmath89=4 ) super - superexchange bridge . in the above order",
    "we assign them the coupling constants @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "since the local symmetry of the cations is low ( point groups @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) and crystalline fields arising from the surrounding oxygens deviate significantly from the usual octahedral and tetrahedral coordinations , reliable prediction of the sign and strength of the exchange interactions just by following the goodenough - kanamori - anderson rules @xcite is rather bold .",
    "nevertheless , the arrangements of the magnetic moments in the determined magnetic structures imply that the @xmath90 and @xmath91 couplings are most probably fm , while the @xmath92 exchange is afm .    in order to determine the above presented exchange interactions",
    ", we first explore all possible combinations of their sign and strength within the model of isotropic heisenberg interactions , using the enermag program.@xcite here , we assume that @xmath90 and @xmath91 are equal , which is justified by their similarity in bonding lengths and angles . as a result , we obtain a list of probable ordering modes for a specific magnetic propagation vector * k * and corresponding intervals of @xmath95 ( @xmath65=1,2 ) .",
    "we find that the only modes , which correspond to @xmath68 irr on both cu - sites ( see table[tab1 ] ) and thus meet the experimental observations , are m@xmath96(++++++ ) and m@xmath97(+@xmath98@xmath98 + 00 ) .",
    "furthermore , we discover that for * k*=(00@xmath17 ) ( lf phase ) and * k*=(000 ) ( hf phase ) the m@xmath96(++++++ ) mode is favorable , when @xmath90 is fm , and @xmath92 can have any sign ; whereas the m@xmath97(+@xmath98@xmath98 + 00 ) mode is obtained , when all couplings are afm .",
    "apparently , these two modes require different sign of couplings and thus implies that the experimentally determined canted magnetic structure , which is a convolution of the two modes , is a result of competing magnetic interactions .    to resolve the canting of the cu1 spins we thus minimize the energy of the magnetic ground state . in line with the experimental observations and to avoid unnecessary complications , we restricted the orientation of the cu1 and cu2 magnetic moments to the @xmath11 plane .",
    "the results show that the experimentally determined canting of the cu1 magnetic moments ( @xmath2550@xmath30 from @xmath5 towards @xmath6 ) can be achieved with isotropic , yet different , interactions .",
    "in fact , we find that @xmath92 should be afm and even stronger than fm @xmath90 , i.e. , @xmath92@xmath25@xmath99 .",
    "this seems contra - intuitive , as the exchange path for @xmath92 is significantly longer than those corresponding to @xmath90 and @xmath91 , and since it involves an additional bi@xmath22 ion .",
    "however , studies of other tellurides and selenides reveal that similar super - superexchange paths can have similar strengths as some significantly shorter superexchange bonds .",
    "@xcite    in order to quantify the strengths of the exchange interactions we take the curie - weiss temperature into consideration , which is defined as the sum of the exchange interactions per magnetic site .",
    "thus we can write the expression : @xmath100 here , we assumed @xmath101@xmath1021 , @xmath10=1,2 counts different cu sites , @xmath65=1,2 counts different exchange interactions ( @xmath91=@xmath90 ) , and @xmath103 is half of the number of cu neighbors coupled by @xmath95 exchange ( @xmath104=2 , @xmath105=1 , @xmath106=2 , @xmath107=0).@xcite hence , based on the experimentally determined @xmath44=80k for @xmath34 and the evaluated @xmath92@xmath25@xmath99 ratio , we estimate @xmath90@xmath10267k and @xmath92@xmath102@xmath108k . similarly , we obtain @xmath90@xmath10250k and @xmath92@xmath102@xmath109k from @xmath39=60k for @xmath110 .",
    "the large afm @xmath92 value is in agreement with afm component remaining beyond 8 t , which reflects in the weak field dependence of magnetization above @xmath27 . on the other hand ,",
    "the derived difference between the exchange interactions parallel and perpendicular to the @xmath5-axis implies the presence of sizable ( @xmath2520% ) exchange anisotropy .",
    "in fact , the difference between the main exchange interactions , @xmath10217k ( i.e. , @xmath2512.6 t ) , is of the same order of magnitude as the observed and estimated saturation magnetic fields of @xmath257 and @xmath2515 t for @xmath60 and @xmath111 , respectively .",
    "the above agreement implies that the magnetic fields , needed to bend the magnetic moments out of the preferred orientation , indeed compensate the exchange anisotropy and is thus in line with the fact that zero - field splitting , imposed by crystal filed , for @xmath16=1/2 systems is negligible and with the apparent @xmath40-factor anisotropy , @xcite reflected in the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "still , the estimated anisotropy is relatively small ( @xmath2520% ) compared to the magnitude of the exchange parameters , which implies that the dominant exchange is heisenberg - like with a sizable exchange anisotropy .",
    "the origin of this anisotropy might be the 2d nature of the magnetic lattice and the specific arrangement of the cu@xmath15 atomic orbitals combined with spin - orbit and coulomb exchange interactions.@xcite    finally , an estimate of the afm interlayer exchange coupling @xmath112 can be obtained , within the weiss field model , from the magnitude of the magnetic field @xmath27=0.8 t required to flip the layers and thus overcome @xmath112 : @xcite @xmath113 taking @xmath19=2 , i.e. , considering two neighboring layeres , the resulting @xmath112 equals 0.5k .",
    "still , the significantly suppressed @xmath2 compared to @xmath95 s is not only a result of weak interlayer couplings , but probably also reflects the competition between afm and fm interactions within the layer .",
    "the anisotropic magnetic properties of the layered kagom - like system cu@xmath0bi(seo@xmath0)@xmath1o@xmath1br have been studied by bulk magnetic measurements and neutron diffraction . we have found that below @xmath2=27.4k the magnetic ground state can be described as antiferromagnetically coupled @xmath3 layers , with moments on the cu2 sites pointing along @xmath5 and those on the cu1 sites alternating between the @xmath114 tilt from @xmath5 towards @xmath6 . at @xmath27@xmath250.8 t applied perpendicular to the layers ( along @xmath5 ) , every second layer flips , resembling a metamagnetic transition to an almost fm structure .    based on the determined spin arrangements and critical fields we provide an estimate of the characteristic exchange couplings of the system . for intralayer exchange ( along the @xmath5 axis )",
    "we thus obtain that nearest - neighbor cu - o - cu exchange is fm ( @xmath90@xmath102@xmath91@xmath10267k ) , while next - nearest - neighbor cu - o - bi - o - cu exchange is even stronger and afm ( @xmath92@xmath102107k ) .",
    "obviously , the nearest - neighbor fm interactions remove geometrical frustration , which would be a dominant feature of the kagom antiferromagnet ; the frustration is only partially restored by next - nearest - neighbor afm interactions , responsible for the canting of cu1 moments .",
    "we note that considerably ( 20% ) lower @xmath95 values were derived for the perpendicular orientation ( along the layers ) , implying a sizable exchange anisotropy .",
    "interestingly , in spite of the fact that the ratio between the interlayer and intralayer couplings is significant , @xmath28@xmath250.006 , and that the exchange interactions are predominantly isotropic , the intensity of the magnetic diffraction peak can be in a broad region below @xmath2 described as @xmath115 , with @xmath76@xmath770.23 , characteristic for finite - sized 2d xy magnetic systems with additional weak in - plane crystal - field anisotropy .",
    "this may imply that interlayer interactions are still weak enough that spin fluctuations below 0.96@xmath2 are essentially 2d , and that the existing magnetic anisotropy could be strong enough to impose a quasi 2d xy behavior .",
