    "understanding of the implications of qcd within the regime of low energy physics has during the past decade become accessible via the technique of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite .",
    "initial applications were in the arena of goldstone boson interactions @xcite together with a few calculations in the baryon sector @xcite , using relativistic baryon chpt . in recent years use of so - called heavy baryon methods",
    "@xcite has generated much interest in calculations involving baryons and a great deal of work has been done studying strong , weak , and electro - magnetic physics in the near threshold region @xcite . in this work",
    "we will focus on su(2 ) heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) , which has become the most fully developed sector within baryon chpt @xcite .",
    "thus - far , consistent extension to higher energies in su(2 ) hbchpt has been limited by treatment of the important @xmath0 resonance only in terms of its contribution to the various counterterms which arise in such calculations .",
    "the technique by which to address this deficiency was developed some time ago @xcite by including the @xmath0 as an explicit degree of freedom in a chiral perturbative scheme .",
    "recently , a reformulation of this formalism which allows for a systematic and explicit calculation of higher order terms in an expansion of soft momenta , the pion mass and the mass difference @xmath10 has been given,@xcite and in this note we apply this technique to the problem of forward nucleon compton scattering and the polarizabilities of the nucleon .",
    "nucleon compton scattering is an area of research which has recently received a great deal of attention , both experimentally and theoretically and in the next section we review the status of such work . in section 3",
    "we give a brief introduction to the formalism necessary to include the @xmath0 in chiral calculations , and in section 4 apply this to evaluate delta contributions to @xmath11 scattering , examine its influence on the polarizabilities and give a critical discussion of our @xmath4 results .",
    "finally , in a concluding section 5 we summarize our findings .",
    "to lowest order the spin - averaged amplitude for compton scattering on the nucleon is given by the thomson amplitude @xmath12 where @xmath13 represent the nucleon charge , mass and @xmath14 and @xmath15 specify the polarization vectors and four - momenta of the initial , final photons respectively . in next order are generated contributions arising from electric and magnetic polarizabilities@xmath5 and @xmath6which measure the response of the nucleon to the application of quasi - static electric and magnetic fields @xmath16 the associated differential scattering cross section on the proton is given by @xmath17 \\nonumber\\\\ \\quad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus by measurement of the differential compton scattering cross section one can extract the electric and magnetic polarizabilities , provided    * the energy is large enough that these terms are significant with respect to the thomson contribution but * not so large that higher order effects dominate .",
    "this has been accomplished for the proton in the energy regime 50 mev@xmath18100 mev , yielding@xcite @xmath19 ( note : in practice one generally uses the results of unitarity and the validity of the forward scattering dispersion relation which yields the baldin sum rule @xmath20 as a constraint , since the uncertainty associated with the integral over the photo - absorption cross section @xmath21 is smaller than that associated with the polarizability measurements . )",
    "since the neutron has no charge , such a thomson - polarizability interference experiment is not possible , so alternative methods must be used .",
    "the most precise measurement involves a recent n - pb scattering experiment , wherein the dipole moment induced in the moving neutron due to the nuclear charge acts back on the pb nucleus .",
    "this second order process and the resulting @xmath22 interaction proportional to the electric polarizability can be detected in a transmission experiment via the characteristic linear dependence on the beam momentum @xmath23 .",
    "this experiment was recently performed at ornl and yielded results@xcite @xmath24 quite similar to those of the proton .",
    "( in this experiment only the electric polarizability is measured directly . however , using the unitarity sum rule result @xmath25 the magnetic polarizability can be extracted . )    on the theoretical side , constituent quark - based approaches which rely on the sum rule@xcite @xmath26 are bound to fail since the sum over intermediate states component of eq.([eq : aa ] ) is in almost any reasonable model identical for both neutron or proton , leading to a prediction @xmath27 in conflict with the experimental result that @xmath28.@xcite the solution to the problem lies in a proper treatment of the pion degrees of freedom of the nucleon , which is suggested by the feature that the leading pion loop contributions to neutron and proton are identical , in agreement with experiment .",
    "the problem can best be addressed using the technique of heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory @xcite , within which at @xmath29 one finds a result @xcite @xmath30 this @xmath31 calculation represents the leading result for @xmath5 and @xmath6 in chpt , but gets the qualitative features of the polarizabilities right and even agreement with experiment !",
    "the results diverge as @xmath32 in the chiral limit , giving support to the idea that at these low energies the photon interacts primarily with the long - range pion cloud of the nucleon . in order to understand the experimental finding that @xmath28",
    "the leading chpt result is not sufficient .",
    "one must include higher order terms in order to find isospin dependent effects and to judge the convergence behaviour of the series hbchpt results for the polarizabilities have been discussed by lvov @xcite . ] .",
    "a calculation at @xmath33 has been performed by bernard , kaiser , schmidt and meiner @xcite . at this order four counterterms",
    "are required , which were estimated by bksm by treating higher resonances  including the delta resonance  as very heavy with respect to the nucleon .",
    "the results of this process are @xmath34 where the uncertainty is associated with the counterterm contribution from the @xmath1 and from @xmath35 loop effects .",
    "a very interesting aspect of this @xmath33 calculation lies in the fact that it identifies a mechanism to counter the large positive contribution on @xmath6 due to @xmath1(1232 ) resonance exchange , which is a well - known problem in calculations of the magnetic polarizability via effective lagrangians @xcite .",
    "bksm found that at @xmath33 ( negative ) @xmath36-loop contributions can essentially balance out the ( positive ) delta effects hidden in the counterterms ! nevertheless , we observe that the uncertainties of their @xmath33 calculation are quite dramatic so that real understanding of the chpt predictions for the polarizabilities will require more work .",
    "in particular , the large uncertainty in @xmath6 is mainly related to poorly known couplings involving @xmath1(1232 ) , which was used to determine some of the counterterms via `` resonance saturation '' .",
    "if one retains @xmath1(1232 ) as an explicit degree of freedom in the chiral calculation , as done in our @xmath4 calculation of section 4 , one can in principle determine all delta couplings of interest from ( other ) experiments in a systematic fashion .",
    "furthermore , one does not limit oneself to the narrow scope of `` resonance saturation '' for the spin 3/2 contributions .",
    "we refer to section 4 for further discussion of this point .",
    "finally , with respect to the magnetic polarizability , we note that the simple quark model _ can _ provide a basic understanding of experiment .",
    "the prediction@xcite @xmath37 involves a substantial diamagnetic recoil contribution @xmath38 which when added to the large paramagnetic contribution due to the @xmath0@xcite @xmath39 gives results in basic agreement with the experimental findings .",
    "hence , it is clear that proper inclusion of the @xmath1 degrees of freedom is essential .",
    "when spin - dependence is included the situation becomes somewhat more complex . in order to simplify the present exploratory analysis ,",
    "we restrict our attention to forward scattering , in which case the amplitude can be written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 are both even functions under crossing@xmath42and are therefore functions only of @xmath43 . in terms of our previous notation",
    "we have @xmath44 while in the case of @xmath45 we can make a similar expansion@xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the anomalous magnetic moment of the target and the new structure @xmath7 is the `` spin - polarizability . '' as in the case of @xmath48 the form of the leading term in the expansion is dictated by rigorous low energy theorems , while the @xmath43 correction represents a probe of hadronic structure .",
    "one difference between the spin - dependent and spin - averaged amplitudes , however , is the asymptotic behavior as @xmath49 . the better behavior of @xmath45 suggested by regge theory allows one to write an unsubtracted dispersion relation in this case , leading to the strictures@xcite @xmath50 \\nonumber\\\\ \\gamma&=&{1\\over 4\\pi^2}\\int_0^\\infty{d\\omega\\over \\omega^3 } [ \\sigma_-(\\omega)-\\sigma_+(\\omega)]\\label{eq : dhg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 are the photo - absorption cross sections for parallel and anti - parallel alignments of photon and target helicities .",
    "the first of these relations  the drell - hearn - gerasimov ( dhg ) sum rule  has received a good deal of attention recently . on the experimental side",
    ", efforts are being mounted to measure the spin - dependent structure function @xmath45 directly , thereby confirming the prediction of the low energy theorem.@xcite however , this has not yet been achieved .",
    "on the theoretical end , there have been a number of attempts to evaluate the dispersive integral of the dhg using what information currently exists for the photo - absorption cross sections .",
    "the existing data set is incomplete in that helicity - dependent cross sections have not yet been measured .",
    "thus one uses existing multipole decompositions from _ unpolarized _ experiments in order to perform the analysis .",
    "such decompositions are available , however , only in the single pion production channel so that above the two pion threshold model - dependent assumptions must be made . with this caveat",
    "present results are somewhat higher than predicted by the low energy theorem @xmath52^ { \\rm multipole}&=&\\left\\ { \\begin{array}{ll } 0.208{\\rm gev}^{-2 } & { \\rm karliner}\\cite{k73}\\\\ 0.210{\\rm gev}^{-2 } & { \\rm workman / arndt}\\cite{wa92}\\\\ 0.182{\\rm gev}^{-2 } & { \\rm burkert / li}\\cite{bl93 }   \\end{array}\\right",

    "we refer the reader to the review article by drechsel @xcite .",
    "these results are in dramatic disagreement with the @xmath31 chpt predictions@xcite @xmath54 unlike the case of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , at present there exists no corresponding @xmath33 chpt calculation that reconciles this discrepancy .",
    "presently the best information about the sub - leading behaviour of @xmath7 comes from a relativistic baryon chpt calculation at the one - loop level @xcite , yielding @xmath55 this calculation does not resolve the discrepancy with the multipole analysis results of eq.([eq : mp ] ) .",
    "however , it is known from phenomenological considerations that @xmath0 makes a major contribution of opposite sign . in section 4.2",
    "we present a systematic chiral calculation of @xmath7 with nucleons , deltas and pions as explicit degrees of freedom .",
    "having given a brief summary of current research in this area we now proceed to outline the formalism which allows inclusion of the @xmath1(1232 ) in a consistent chiral power counting framework .",
    "the subject of su(2 ) heavy baryon chpt of nucleons and pions has been well developed in recent years @xcite . in the conventional form",
    "one organizes the calculation according to an @xmath56 powercounting , where @xmath57 denotes either a soft momentum or the pion mass @xmath58 .",
    "all nucleon resonances , strange particles , vector mesons , etc .",
    "are integrated out , i.e. they only appear in higher order contact interactions . for near threshold processes",
    "this program has proved highly successful  for an outstanding review of the field we refer the reader to ref .",
    "however , phenomenologically it is known that in the nucleon sector the first nucleon resonance@xmath1(1232)lies very close to the nucleon and can exert its influence even to processes at very low energies .",
    "this special situation in the baryon sector has early on @xcite prompted suggestions to keep the spin-3/2 baryon resonances as explicit degrees of freedom in the chiral lagrangian in order to include all relevant physics and to improve the convergence of the perturbation series .",
    "if one retains @xmath1(1232 ) as an explicit degree of freedom in su(2 ) hbchpt , one is faced with an additional dimensionful parameter @xmath59 , which corresponds to the mass splitting between the nucleon and the delta resonance in the chiral limit .",
    "phenomenologically @xmath1 is a small parameter of @xmath60 mev which , unlike @xmath58 remains finite in the chiral limit . as was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite one can nevertheless set up a consistent field - theoretic hbchpt formalism provided one organizes the calculation according to an @xmath61 powercounting , where @xmath3 now denotes a small scale of either a soft momentum , the pion mass or the mass splitting @xmath1 .",
