    "entanglement renormalization@xcite is a renormalization group ( rg ) approach to quantum many - body systems on a lattice . as with most rg methods @xcite",
    ", it proceeds by coarse - graining the microscopic degrees of freedom of a many - body system , and thus also their hamiltonian @xmath0 , to produce a sequence of effective systems , with hamiltonians @xmath1 that define a flow towards larger length scale / lower energies .",
    "entanglement renormalization operates in _ real space _",
    "( it does not rely on fourier space analysis ) and it is a _ non - perturbative _ approach ( that is , it can handle interactions of any strength ) . as a result",
    ", it has a wide range of applicability , from quantum criticality @xcite to emergent topological order @xcite , from frustrated antiferromagnets @xcite to interacting fermions @xcite and even to interacting anyons @xcite .",
    "entanglement renormalization produces an efficient ( approximate ) representation of the ground state of the system in terms of a variational tensor network , the multi - scale entanglement renormalization ansatz ( mera ) @xcite , from which one can extract expectation values of arbitrary local observables .",
    "most applications of the mera have so far focused on systems that are translation invariant . here",
    "we will consider instead systems where translation invariance is explicitly broken by the presence of a defect . for simplicity , we assume that the defect is placed on an infinite quantum critical system that , in the absence of the defect , would be both homogeneous ( that is , translation invariant ) and a fixed point of the rg ( that is , scale invariant ) .",
    "under that assumption , the mera offers a shockingly simple description : in the absence of the defect it is completely characterized by a single pair of tensors @xmath2 and , in the presence of the defect , by just one additional tensor @xmath3 if the defect is also itself at a ( scale invariant ) fixed point of the rg flow ; or by a sequence of a few additional tensors @xmath4 that describe its flow towards an rg fixed point .    in this paper",
    "we propose and benchmark algorithms for quantum critical systems in the presence of defects that exploit the simple description afforded by the mera .",
    "we start by briefly reviewing the required background material on entanglement renormalization , including a recently proposed theory of minimal updates @xcite that is at the core of the surprisingly compact mera description of defects in quantum critical systems .",
    "two distinctive aspects of entanglement renormalization are the _ tensor network _ structure of the coarse - graining transformation and the _ variational _ nature of the approach .    the coarse - graining transformation is implemented by a linear ( isometric ) map @xmath5 , relating the hilbert spaces of the lattice system before and after coarse - graining . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : er](a ) , the linear map @xmath5 decomposes as a network of tensors , called disentanglers @xmath6 and isometries @xmath7 .",
    "the structure of the network has been designed with the important property that @xmath5 preserves locality : local operators are mapped into local operators .",
    "thus , if @xmath0 is a short - ranged hamiltonian , then the effective hamiltonians @xmath8,@xmath9 , etc , are also short - ranged .    on the other hand",
    ", the approach is variational .",
    "the disentanglers @xmath6 and isometries @xmath7 are loaded with variational parameters , which are determined through energy minimization .",
    "this ensures that the coarse - graining transformation @xmath5 is properly adapted to the system under consideration .",
    "that is , instead of deciding a priori which degrees of freedom should be kept and which should be thrown away , the method proceeds by asking the hamiltonian @xmath0 which part of many - body hilbert space corresponds to low energies and proceeds to safely remove the rest .     for a lattice in @xmath10 dimensions that decomposes as a tensor network made of disentanglers @xmath6 , depicted as squares , and isometries @xmath7 , depicted as triangles .",
    "( b ) the mera on a @xmath10 dimensional lattice made of @xmath11 sites , obtained by collecting together a sequence of coarse - graining transformations @xmath12.,width=321 ]    however , the most prominent feature of entanglement renormalization , setting it apart from other real space rg approaches , is its handling of short - range entanglement . while isometries @xmath7",
    "map a block of sites into an effective site , and thus play a rather standard role in a coarse - graining transformation , disentanglers @xmath6 perform a more singular task : the removal of short - range entanglement from the system .",
    "thanks to this removal , the coarse - graining transformation @xmath5 constitutes a proper implementation of the rg @xcite , in that the sequence of effective systems , with hamiltonians @xmath13 , only retain degrees of freedom corresponding to increasing length scales . in particular , at fixed - points of the rg flow , entanglement renormalization explicitly realizes scale invariance : the system before coarse - graining and the system after coarse - graining are seen to be locally identical .",
    "the mera @xcite is the class of tensor network state that results from joining the sequence of coarse - graining transformations @xmath14 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : er](b ) .",
    "it is a variational ansatz for ground states ( or , more generally , low energy states ) of many - body systems on a lattice in @xmath15 spatial dimensions . by construction",
    ", the mera extends in @xmath16 dimensions , where the additional dimension corresponds to length scale or rg flow . as a result ,",
    "it is distinctly well suited to study systems where several length scales are relevant , because the information related to each length scale is stored in a different part of the network .",
    "in particular , the mera offers an extremely compact description of ground states of homogeneous systems at fixed points of the rg flow , that is , in systems with both translation invariance and scale invariance . these encompass both stable ( gapped ) rg fixed points , which include topologically ordered systems @xcite , and unstable ( gapless ) rg fixed points , corresponding to quantum critical systems @xcite .",
    "indeed , translation invariance leads to a position - independent coarse - graining transformation @xmath5 , made of copies of a single pair of tensors @xmath17 , whereas scale invariance implies that the same @xmath5 can be used at all scales . as a result",
    ", the single pair @xmath18 completely characterizes the state of an infinite system .",
    "the study of quantum critical systems is therefore among the natural targets of the mera . until now , most applications of the mera to quantum criticality have focused on systems that are invariant under translations ( see , however , refs . ) . in translation invariant systems ,",
    "the mera provides direct access to the universal information of the quantum phase transition , as often encoded in the conformal data of an underlying conformal field theory@xcite ( cft ) ( see appx .",
    "[ sect : mera ] for a review ) .",
    "in particular , in one spatial dimension one can extract the central charge and identify the set of primary scaling operators @xmath19 ( both local @xcite and non - local @xcite ) together with their scaling dimensions @xmath20 ( from which most critical exponents of the theory follow ) as well as the corresponding operator product expansion coefficients .",
    "this data completely characterizes the underlying cft .",
    "the goal of this manuscript is to address quantum critical systems where the translation invariance of a system is explicitly broken by the presence of a _ boundary _ , an _ impurity _ , an _ interface _ , etc .",
    "we refer to any such obstruction to translation invariance generically as a _ defect _ , and to the system in the absence of the defects as the _ host _ system .",
    "methods for simulating quantum critical systems with such defects are important in order to understand and model their effects in realistic settings .",
    "a major difficulty in addressing such systems is that , since the presence of a defect manifestly breaks the translation invariance of the host hamiltonian , the ground state is no longer homogeneous . instead",
    ", expectation values of local observables differ from the homogeneous case throughout the whole system by an amount that only decays as a power law with the distance to the defect . in this scenario a natural option ( which we will not follow here ) would be to choose a coarse - graining map @xmath5 with position - dependent disentanglers and isometries that adjust to the power law profile of ground state expectation values .",
    "notice that the resulting mera would be made of a large number ( proportional to the system size ) of inequivalent disentanglers and isometries , and would therefore incur much larger computational costs ( again , proportional to the system size ) than in a homogeneous system .",
    "importantly , we would not be able to study infinite systems directly , and when extracting the low energy properties of the defect , these would be significantly contaminated by ubiquitous finite size effects , which vanish as a power law with the system size .",
    "what one would like , then , is a mera description of many - body systems with defects that is nearly as compact as in the homogeneous case .",
    "fortunately , a recent theory of _ minimal updates _ in holography @xcite provides us with a recipe to obtain such a description .",
    "let @xmath0 denote a local hamiltonian for an extended many - body system on a @xmath15-dimensional lattice , and let @xmath21 @xmath22 denote the hamiltonian for the same system after we added a new term @xmath23 localized in region @xmath24 .",
    "in addition , let @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the ground states of the hamiltonian @xmath0 and of hamiltonian @xmath21 ( the modified hamiltonian ) , respectively .",
    "then , the theory of minimal updates in holography @xcite argues in favor of the following conjecture .    _ * conjecture ( minimal update ) : * a mera for @xmath26 can be obtained from a mera for @xmath25 by modifying the latter only in the causal cone @xmath27 of region @xmath24 . _    here , the causal cone @xmath27 of region @xmath24 is the part of the mera that describes the successive coarse - graining of region @xmath28 .",
    "for instance , for a region @xmath24 consisting of two contiguous sites , fig .",
    "[ fig : directedmera ] illustrates the causal cone @xmath27 .",
    "the figure also shows how a mera for @xmath25 should be modified to obtain a mera for @xmath26 .     of a lattice hamiltonian @xmath0 in @xmath10 space dimensions .",
    "scale and translation invariance result in a compact description : two tensors @xmath29 are repeated throughout the infinite tensor network .",
    "( b ) the theory of minimal updates dictates that the ground state @xmath26 of the hamiltonian @xmath30 is represented by a mera with the same tensors @xmath29 outside the causal cone @xmath31 ( shaded ) , whereas inside @xmath31 two new tensors @xmath32 are repeated throughout the semi - infinite causal cone .",
    "( c - d ) the same illustrations , without drawing the tensors of the network.,width=321 ]      in this paper we propose and benchmark mera algorithms for quantum critical system with one or several defects .",
    "the theoretical foundation of the algorithms is the above conjecture on minimal updates , specialized to a hamiltonian of the form @xmath33 where @xmath0 is the hamiltonian for the host system and @xmath34 is the hamiltonian describing the localized defect .",
    "more specifically , we will assume that the host hamiltonian @xmath0 , which describes an infinite system on a lattice , is a homogeneous , critical , fixed - point hamiltonian , so that its ground state @xmath25 can be succinctly described by a mera that is characterized in terms of just a single pair of tensors @xmath17 .",
    "region @xmath24 will typically consists of one or two sites .",
    "then , following the above conjecture , a mera for the ground state @xmath35 of the hamiltonian @xmath36 , which we call _ modular _ mera and will be further described in sect . [",
    "sect : modularity ] , is completely characterized in terms of two sets of tensors , see fig .",
    "[ fig : directedmera ] .",
    "first , the pair of tensors @xmath17 corresponding to the ( scale and translation invariant ) host system , is repeated throughout the outside of the causal cone of the defect .",
    "second , ( for a defect that is scale invariant , that is , a fixed point of the rg flow ) another pair of tensors @xmath37 is repeated throughout the inside of the causal cone of the defect . after some rewiring of the modular mera , this second pair @xmath38 will be replaced by a single tensor @xmath3 .",
    "[ some settings will require slight modifications of this simple description .",
    "for instance , in the case of interfaces involving several types of system , each system will contribute a different pair of tensors for the outside of the causal cone .",
    "on the other hand , if the defect is not yet at a fixed - point of the rg flow , then instead of a single tensor @xmath3 , a sequence of scale - dependent tensors @xmath4 will be used to account for the flow of the defect into the rg fixed - point . ]",
    "the modular mera leads to simple numerical algorithms for quantum critical systems in the presence of one of several defects , which complement and generalize those discussed in ref . for homogeneous systems . as in the homogeneous case ,",
    "the computational cost of the new algorithms is independent of the system size , allowing us to address infinite systems . in this way",
    ", we can extract the universal , low energy properties associated to a defect directly in the thermodynamic limit , where they are free of finite - size effects .",
    "although in this paper we restrict our attention to systems in @xmath10 dimensions for simplicity , the key idea of the algorithms can also be applied to systems in @xmath39 dimensions . in the discussion in sect .",
    "[ sect : conclusion ] we will also address how to lift the assumption , present throughout this work , that the host system is both translation and scale invariant .",
    "the algorithms proposed in this paper are thus based on assuming the validity of the conjectured theory of minimal updates in holography of ref . .",
    "we contribute to that theory in two ways .",
    "first , by applying the above conjecture recursively , we will investigate applications that go well beyond the simple scenario described in ref .",
    ", namely that of a single impurity . specifically , the _ modular _ mera describes the ground state of a complex system , such as an interface between two systems @xmath40 and @xmath41 , by combining ` modules ' obtained by studying simpler systems , such as homogeneous versions of system @xmath40 and system @xmath41 , separately .",
    "modularity is central to the algorithms proposed in this work and key to their computational efficiency .",
    "second , the benchmark results presented here constitute solid evidence that the conjectured minimal updates are indeed sufficient to accurately represent a large variety of defects .",
    "this contributes significantly to establishing the theory of minimal updates , which so far was supported mostly by the theoretical arguments provided in ref . .",
    "in this paper we assume that the reader is already familiar with the scale invariant mera for translation invariant systems ( a detailed introduction to which can be found in ref . ) .",

    "[ sect : optmod ] discusses how to optimize the modular mera .",

    "the modular mera is built upon the conjecture that the presence of a defect can be accurately accounted for by only updating the interior of the causal cone @xmath27 of the region @xmath24 on which the defect is supported .",

    "let us consider a scale invariant mera with no transitional layers , that is composed of an infinite sequence of a scale invariant map @xmath543 , described by a single pair @xmath545 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twocorr](a ) , a one - site operator @xmath96 , placed on certain lattice sites , is coarse - grained under the action of layer @xmath543 into new one - site operator @xmath88 .",
    "this coarse - graining is implemented with the one - site scaling superoperator @xmath100 , @xmath560 where @xmath100 is defined in terms of the isometry @xmath561 and its conjugate , see also fig .",
    "[ fig : twocorr](b ) .",
    "the ( one - site ) scaling operators @xmath562 are defined as those operators that transform covariantly under action of @xmath100 , @xmath563 where @xmath564 is the scaling dimension of scaling operator @xmath562 . as is customary in rg analysis , the scaling operators @xmath562 and their scaling dimensions @xmath564 can be obtained through diagonalization of the scaling superoperator @xmath565 .",
    "one can obtain explicit expressions for two - point correlation functions of the scale invariant mera based upon their scaling operators , as we now describe .",
    "let us suppose that two scaling operators @xmath562 and @xmath566 are placed on special sites @xmath161 and @xmath567 that are at a distance of @xmath568 sites apart for positive integer @xmath569 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twocorr](c ) .",
    "the correlator @xmath570 can be evaluated by coarse - graining the scaling operators until they occupy adjacent sites , where the expectation value @xmath571 can then be evaluated with the local two - site density matrix @xmath572 ( which is the same at every level of the mera due to scale invariance ) .    for each level of coarse - graining applied to the scaling operators @xmath562 and @xmath566",
    ", we pick up a factor of the eigenvalues of the scaling operators , as described eq .",
    "[ eq : b10b ] , and the distance @xmath93 between the scaling operators shrinks by a factor of 3 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : twocorr](c ) , which leads to the relation @xmath573 notice that the scaling operators are coarse - grained onto adjacent sites after @xmath574 levels , thus through iteration of eq .",
    "[ eq : b11 ] we have @xmath575 where constant @xmath576 is the expectation value of the correlators evaluated on adjacent sites , @xmath577 thus it is seen that the correlator of two scaling operators @xmath562 and @xmath566 scales polynomially in the distance between the operators , with an exponent that is the sum of their corresponding scaling dimensions @xmath20 and @xmath122 , in agreement with predictions from cft @xcite .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "[ eq : b12 ] was derived from structural considerations of the mera alone and , as such , holds regardless of how the tensors in the scale invariant mera have been optimized .",
    "this argument is only valid for the chosen special locations @xmath161 and @xmath567 . for a generic pair of locations , the polynomial decay of correlations",

    "( b ) the definition of reflection symmetry for a disentangler @xmath6.,width=188 ]",
    "in this appendix we describe how symmetry under spatial reflection can be exactly enforced into the mera .",
    "this is done by directly incorporating reflection symmetry in each of the tensors of the mera ( note that an equivalent approach , dubbed inversion symmetric mera , was recently proposed in ref . ) .",
    "such a step was found to be key in applications of the modular mera to quantum critical systems with a defect , as considered in sect .",
    "[ sect : bench ] .",
    "indeed , we found that in order for the modular mera to be an accurate representation of the ground state of a quantum critical system with a defect , the homogeneous system ( that is , the system in the absence of the defect ) had to be addressed with a reflection invariant mera .",
    "let us describe how the individual tensors of the mera , namely the isometries @xmath7 and disentanglers @xmath6 , can be chosen to be reflection symmetric , i.e. @xmath582 see fig .",
    "[ fig : refsym ] . here",
    "@xmath583 is a superoperator that denotes spatial reflection , which squares to the identity .",
    "the spatial reflection on a tensor involves permutation of its indices , as well as a ` reflection ' within each index , as enacted by a unitary matrix @xmath581 such that @xmath584 .",
    "the latter is needed because each index of the tensor effectively represents several sites of the original system , which also need to be reflected ( permuted ) .",
    "matrix @xmath581 has eigenvalues @xmath292 corresponding to reflection symmetric and reflection antisymmetric states , respectively .",
    "it is convenient , though not always necessary , to work within a basis such that each @xmath489-dimensional index @xmath585 decomposes as @xmath586 , where @xmath587 labels the parity ( @xmath588 for even parity and @xmath290 for odd parity ) and @xmath589 labels the distinct values of @xmath585 with parity @xmath587 .",
    "in such a basis , @xmath581 is diagonal , with the diagonal entries corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath292 .",
    "let us turn our attention to the question of how reflection symmetry , as described in eq .",
    "[ s8e1 ] , can be imposed on the mera tensors . for concreteness",
    ", we consider an isometry @xmath7 ( analogous considerations apply to a disentangler ) .",
    "notice that we can not just symmetrize @xmath7 under reflections directly , @xmath590 because the new , reflection symmetric tensor @xmath591 will no longer be isometric .",
    "instead , we can include an additional step in the optimization algorithm that symmetrizes the _ environment _ of the tensors before each tensor is updated . in the optimization of the mera @xcite , in order to update an isometry @xmath7 one first computes its linearized environment @xmath592 .",
    "now , to obtain an updated isometry that is reflection symmetric , we first symmetrize its environment , @xmath593 in this way we ensure that the updated isometry @xmath591 ( which is obtained through a svd of @xmath594 , see ref . )",
    ", is reflection symmetric , yet also retains its isometric character . likewise the environments @xmath595 of disentanglers",
    "@xmath6 should also be symmetrized .     from the ternary mera , which coarse - grains three @xmath489-dimensional lattice sites into a single @xmath489 dimensional lattice site , is decomposed into upper and lower binary isometries , @xmath596 and @xmath597 .",
    "the index connecting the upper and lower binary isometries is chosen at an independent dimension @xmath598 .",
    "( b ) the upper and lower binary isometries @xmath596 and @xmath597 should be chosen to maximize their overlap with the ternary isometry @xmath7 against the one - site density matrix @xmath572 , see eq . [ s9e1].,width=321 ]",
    "in the formulation of modular mera described in sect . [ sect : modularity ] it was convenient to decompose some of the isometries @xmath7 of the mera used to describe the homogeneous system into pairs of upper and lower isometries @xmath596 and @xmath597 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : isosplit](a ) . in this section",
    "we discuss how this can be accomplished .",
    "let @xmath489 denote the bond dimension of the indices of the isometry @xmath7 , and let @xmath493 denote the index connecting the upper and lower isometries @xmath596 and @xmath597 . since @xmath493 effectively represents two sites with bond dimension @xmath489 , we have that the isometric character of @xmath54 requires @xmath599 .",
    "we should perform this decomposition such that it does not change the quantum state described by the mera ( perhaps to within some very small error ) .",
    "therefore the best choice of upper @xmath596 and lower @xmath597 isometries follows from maximizing their overlap with the isometry @xmath7 against the one - site density matrix @xmath572 .",
    "that is , we choose them such that they maximize @xmath600 see fig .",
    "[ fig : isosplit](b ) . given the density matrix @xmath572 and isometry @xmath7 , one can obtain @xmath54 and @xmath55 by iteratively maximizing the above trace over each of the two tensors , one at a time .",
    "ideally , we would like the decomposition of @xmath7 into the product of @xmath54 and @xmath55 to be exact , that is , such that such that @xmath601 .",
    "this is typically only possible for @xmath602 .",
    "however , in practice we find that for choice of bond dimension @xmath598 between one or two times the dimension @xmath489 , i.e. @xmath603 , the above trace is already @xmath604 with @xmath605 negligibly small . the use of a @xmath493 smaller than @xmath606 results in a reduction of computational costs ."
