    "resistive plate chamber ( rpc ) detectors have been adopted by the lhcb collaboration to cover a large fraction ( about 48% ) of the muon system  @xcite .",
    "the lhcb experiment  @xcite covers the forward part of the solid angle and is therefore subject to a very large particle flux .",
    "in particular , the particle rates expected in the muon system are significantly larger than those expected by atlas  @xcite and cms experiments  @xcite . in the regions covered by rpcs",
    ", the maximum particle rate is expected to vary between 0.25 and 0.75 khz/@xmath0 , depending mainly on the polar angle .",
    "these large rates are potentially dangerous from the point of view of the rpc aging , which must be carefully studied and evaluated .",
    "the main aging effect for rpcs is produced by the current flowing through the resistive plates ; it has been demonstrated , indeed , that the irradiation of bakelite slabs with photons up to an integrated dose of 20 kgy does not produce any degradation in the bakelite properties  @xcite .",
    "the most important parameter to evaluate the aging effects is given therefore by the total charge flow accross the detector during its lifetime .",
    "assuming an average avalanche charge of 30 pc  @xcite , the total charge integrated by lhcb rpcs over 10 years of operation range from 0.35 c/@xmath0 , in the regions of the muon system where the particle flux is smaller , to about 1.1 c/@xmath0 in the high rate regions .",
    "aging tests performed by the rpc groups of atlas and cms have shown that their detectors can withstand the radiation doses expected in those experiments . however , these tests are based on an integrated charge of at most 0.3 c/@xmath0  @xcite which is four times smaller than the maximum expected in lhcb rpcs .    to cope with the lhcb requirements ,",
    "an extensive aging programme has been devised , which started in january 2001 and is expected to last , at a first stage , until december 2001 , exploiting the large cern gamma irradiation facility ( gif )  @xcite , where a @xmath1cs gamma source of about 655 gbq is available .",
    "the aging test consists in irradiating for about one year a single gap rpc ( _ irradiated rpc _ ) at the gif facility .",
    "the position closest to the source available for the chamber is at about 1 meter , where the photon flux is , roughly , 1.5 khz/@xmath0 .",
    "another chamber ( _ reference rpc _ ) is installed just outside the irradiation area .",
    "both chambers share the same gas and high voltage lines so that they are operated in the same conditions . in this way it is possible to disentangle the effects due to variations in the environment parameters , such as temperature , pressure or gas quality , from those due to the irradiation .",
    "the two rpcs prepared for the aging test have resistive plates made of phenolic bakelite with resistivity @xmath2  cm .",
    "the plates are oiled with linseed oil .",
    "the size of both chambers is 50x50 @xmath0 .",
    "the readout strips of the irradiated rpc are 3 cm wide and have been cut in two along their length , so that the final strip area is 3x25 @xmath0 .",
    "the strips of the reference chamber , instead , are 3 cm wide and 50 cm long .",
    "the rpcs are operated with a gas mixture consisting of 95% @xmath3 , 4% @xmath4 , 1% @xmath5 . to simulate the lhcb conditions and perform the test in a reasonable amount of time",
    ", the applied voltage was chosen in such a way to have an average avalanche charge of about 50 pc , that , at the rate quoted above , yields a current density of about 80 na/@xmath0 .",
    "this , with a realistic duty factor of 30% , gives an integrated charge of about 0.8 c/@xmath0 in one year of irradiation , which corresponds to about 7 lhcb years in the worst background conditions .",
    "all the relevant parameters of the test , temperature , pressure , high voltage and currents drawn by the chambers , are continuously monitored and recorded on a pc . in figure",
    "[ fig : current_irr ] the current drawn by the irradiated rpc is shown as a function of time ( top plot ) along with the temperature ( middle plot ) . in the bottom plot the current drawn by the reference rpc",
    "is also shown .",
    "the latter is reasonably stable and constant over the whole aging test , showing that the chambers have been operated rather smoothly and no large systematic effects are expected to affect the performance of the two rpcs . in figure",
    "[ fig : current_int ] , the integrated charge as a function of time is shown .",
    "the irradiated rpc has accumulated about 0.45 c/@xmath0 corresponding to about 4 lhcb years in the regions with the highest background rate and to more than 10 lhcb years in the low background regions .    to check the performance of the irradiated chamber at this intermediate aging stage ,",
    "a beam test was performed , using the muon beam available at the gif . in the next sections",
    "the results of this test will be described .",
    "10 @xmath0 rpc .",
    ", width=272 ]",
    "the irradiated and the reference rpcs have been carefully tested exploiting the muon beam available at the gif .",
    "the test setup is sketched in figure  [ fig : test_setup ] .",
    "the combined use of the gamma source and the beam allows a test of the chamber performance parameters , like efficiency , cluster size and rate capability , under different photon fluxes , ranging from zero ( source off ) up to a maximum that , in this test setup , was about 1 khz/@xmath0 .",
    "the chambers were operated in the same conditions as in the aging test from the point of view of the gas and high voltage supplies .",
    "the chamber efficiency was evaluated by tracking the beam particles with a scintillator hodoscope and with an additional small @xmath6 @xmath0 rpc .",
    "the photon fluxes were estimated from the chamber counting rates measured during dedicated off - spill gates .",
    "the measurements described in the next sections were obtained at three different source attenuation values , namely attenuation 1 , 2 and 5 corresponding roughly to 1 khz/@xmath0 , 0.7 khz/@xmath0 and 0.4 khz/@xmath0 photon fluxes respectively .",
    "the current drawn by the irradiated chamber with the source on , was found to be about a factor of two smaller than that of the reference rpc as can be seen from figure  [ fig : currents ] .            as a function of @xmath7  for the two rpcs at different photon fluxes , width=272 ]",
    "this effect can be interpreted within a model introduced in  @xcite . in this simple model",
    "one assumes that under a high particle flux , the rpc working point is determined by an effective voltage @xmath8 where v is the applied voltage , i is the current drawn by the chamber and r is the resistance of the resistive plates . in this framework ,",
    "quantities such as the average avalanche charge @xmath9  or the chamber efficiency @xmath10 are only functions of the gas properties and of @xmath7 .",
    "this means that once the correct value of the resistance r has been determined , the functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 must be universal functions independent on the particle flux and on the plate characteristics .",
    "this method allows a non destructive estimation of the plate resistivity , that can be monitored on  line during the aging test .",
    "@xmath9 is measured by normalising the current drawn by the chambers to the rate of converted photons , which can be obtained from the chamber counting rate at the plateau , corrected for the efficiency .",
    "the measured counting rates are plotted in figure  [ fig : rates ] .",
    "the distributions of @xmath9  for the two rpcs , at different photon fluxes , are plotted as a function of @xmath7  in figure  [ fig : qgamma ] ; they are fairly consistent with a single curve .",
    "the resulting values of the plate resistance , for the irradiated and the reference rpcs are @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively corresponding to equivalent bakelite resistivities @xmath15 and @xmath16 . compared to the original resistivity value and to the reference chamber , a large increase in the plate resistivity for the irradiated rpc",
    "can be observed , which can be ascribed to the radiation effect and that accounts for the current drop mentioned above .",
    "the efficiencies of the two rpcs are plotted as a function of @xmath7 in figure  [ fig : efficiencies ] .",
    "again , the curves are consistent with an universal function @xmath11 .     at different photon fluxes.,width=272 ]      because of the stringent requirements imposed by the lhcb muon trigger  @xcite , the rpcs are required to have an efficiency above 95% up to the maximum expected background rate . in order to test the ability of the irradiated rpc to work within the lhcb operational parameters , the rate capability of the two rpcs has been carefully tested . in figure",
    "[ fig : rate_capability ] the rpc efficiency as a function of the photon flux for three different high voltage values is shown .",
    "the efficiency values are normalised to those obtained with the source off . at the nominal applied voltage of 10.2 kv , the efficiency exceeds 95% for both chambers up to a photon flux of about 0.8 khz/@xmath0 .",
    "however , as soon as the high voltage is raised by a few hundreds volts , the rpcs recover their full efficiency up to a flux of more than 1 khz/@xmath0 .",
    "moreover there is no evidence of a different behaviour between the irradiated and the reference rpc . from this test it is possible to conclude that the rpcs under test can be safely operated , from the aging point of view , at least for 4 lhcb years in the worst expected background conditions .          in the design of rpcs for lhcb",
    ", the level of dark currents drawn by the chambers is of concern , especially from the aging point of view .",
    "the dark currents will contribute an aging effect that must be kept well below the aging caused by the particle flux .",
    "considering as acceptable an extra - aging of 25% , the dark current density must be kept below 3 na/@xmath0 , over the experiment lifetime .        to check if these constraints are fulfilled , the behaviour of the dark currents of the chambers under test has been studied . in figure",
    "[ fig : dark_currents ] the dark currents drawn by the two rpcs as a function of the applied voltage , measured at different intermediate times during the aging test are shown . a large increase of the dark current drawn by the irradiated rpc can be clearly observed .",
    "the effect of the irradiation amounts to about 2 na/@xmath0 .",
    "this behaviour is still under investigation and no interpretation can be worked out yet .",
    "anyhow , it is worth to stress that the dark current observed in the irradiated chamber is still below the maximum allowed value for the lhcb muon system .",
    "the results of an aging test of an rpc prototype for the lhcb muon system have been described .",
    "the irradiated prototype has been tested with a muon beam at the gif after a charge of 0.45 c/@xmath0 has been integrated , corresponding to about 4 years of lhcb at the highest expected background rate and to more than 10 lhcb years in the lower rate regions of the muon system .",
    "the performance of the irradiated rpc has been compared to that of a reference chamber . as an effect of the irradiation ,",
    "a large increase of the resistivity of the chamber plates in the irradiated rpc has been observed ; a clear increase of the dark current is also observed .",
    "the irradiated rpc prototype is still well efficient up to the maximum rate expected in the lhcb muon system and the dark current level is under control ."
