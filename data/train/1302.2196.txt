    "now that the higgs - like particle has been discovered in large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite , one of primary interests of particle physics is to understand mechanism of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking . to settle down the unsolved issues including the hierarchy problem , there have been proposed several promising courses including supersymmetric , composite - higgs and extra - dimensional models . among them , the gauge - higgs unification with extra dimensions @xcite produces brilliant dynamics of gauge symmetry breaking , called the hosotani mechanism @xcite , with the higgs particle as an extra - dimensional component of the gauge field : when adjoint fermions are introduced with periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) in gauge theory with a compact dimension , the compact - space component of the gauge field can develop a non - zero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , which breaks the gauge symmetry to its subgroup spontaneously .",
    "this phenomenon originates in the non - abelian aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "there have been proposed a number of bsm models directly and indirectly based on this mechanism @xcite    recently , the same phenomenon has been observed in a different context . as well - known , the imaginary time dimension is compacted in the finite - temperature ( quantum chromodynamics ) qcd .",
    "when the adjoint fermion is introduced with pbc in the theory , it was shown that exotic phases appear @xcite , where the color trace of polyakov line takes non - trivial vev leading to the dynamical gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "this can be interpreted as @xmath3 realization of the hosotani mechanism .",
    "further study is now required to understand detailed properties and phase diagram for this case . as for the five - dimensional gauge theory on @xmath4 ,",
    "lattice simulation is still at the stage to understand the nature of 5d pure yang - mills theory .",
    "first attempt was done in ref .",
    "@xcite and recent progress was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . at the present",
    ", we have no detailed investigation on the phase structure of the five - dimensional gauge theory with dynamical quarks .",
    "the purpose of our work is to understand properties of gauge theories with quarks on @xmath3 and @xmath4 by using effective theories and show a guideline for further lattice simulations .",
    "we focus on the phase structure in @xmath0 gauge theory by mainly using the perturbative one - loop effective potential .",
    "when we look into chiral properties , the polyakov - loop - extended nambu  jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) model @xcite is introduced .",
    "we obtain the phase diagram in the quark - mass and compacted - size space for several different choices of fermion representations and boundary conditions . in the theory with adjoint fermions with pbc",
    ", we find rich phase diagram with unusual phases where @xmath0 gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken to @xmath1 ( split phase ) or @xmath2 ( re - confined phase ) .",
    "this result is consistent with the recent lattice simulations @xcite and the perturbative calculations for massless quarks @xcite .",
    "we show that chiral condensate is gradually decreased and the chiral symmetry is slowly restored with the compacted size being decreased although small chiral transitions coincide with the deconfined / split and split / reconfined transitions .",
    "we also study phase diagram for the case with both fundamental and adjoint quarks , and show that the split phase becomes more dominant as a result of the explicit breaking of @xmath5 center symmetry .",
    "this result indicates that the @xmath6 phase , which is of significance in terms of phenomenology , can be controlled by adjusting the number of fundamental flavors . in this case",
    "we point out that another unusual ( @xmath2 ) phase with negative vev of color - traced polyakov loop emerges , which we call  pseudo - reconfined phase \" .",
    "we note similar investigation on the phase diagram of compact - space gauge theory with pbc fermions were shown in @xcite , where the authors focus on the volume independence of the vacuum structure from the viewpoint of the large n reduction @xcite . in order to reproduce the confined phase at low temperature",
    ", they used the gluon effective potentials with the mass - dimension parameter , which leads to explicit gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "since these effective potentials do not suit our purpose of studying spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking due to the hosotani mechanism , we mainly use setups with manifest gauge symmetry .",
    "it is also notable that gauge symmetry breaking for all clasical lie groups with pbc matters are classified from topological viewpoints in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as following . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ep ] , we show our setups including the one - loop potential and the pnjl model .",
    "[ sec : ps4 ] shows our numerical results for four dimensional cases .",
    "[ sec : ps5 ] shows the results for five - dimensional cases . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ob ] we discuss how our predictions can be checked in the lattice simulations .",
    "[ sec : sum ] is devoted to summary .",
    "in this section we discuss our setups for su(n ) gauge theory .",
    "the one - loop effective potential is composed of two parts , gluonic and quark contributions . since",
    "our goal is to study the phase diagram in terms of wilson - line phases ( polyakov - line phases ) , @xmath7 @xmath8 , we will write the effective potential as a function of these variables . besides the one - loop potential , we consider the contribution from the chiral part , which originates in the njl - type four - point interactions .",
    "the total effective potential is then regarded as that of the pnjl model @xcite as a function of the @xmath7 and the chiral condensate @xmath9 .",
    "depending on our purposes , we in some cases use only the perturbative one - loop effective potential , and in other cases use the pnjl effective potential .",
    "we also comment on possible deformation reflecting non - perturbative effects in the gluonic contribution .",
    "we begin with one - loop effective potential for @xmath10 gauge theory . in four dimensions ,",
    "the finite - temperature one - loop effective potential for gauge bosons and fermions is well studied in ref .",
    "what we do in the present study is just to regard the compacted imaginary - time direction as one of the spatial direction , and to replace @xmath11 by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a size of the compacted dimension .",
    "firstly , we rewrite the @xmath10 gauge boson field as @xmath14 where @xmath15 stands for a compact direction and @xmath16 is a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) while @xmath17 is fluctuation from it . the vev can be replaced by @xmath18 where @xmath19 s color structure is @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "we note that eigenvalues of @xmath7 are invariant under all gauge transformations preserving boundary conditions",
    ". then we can easily observe spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking from values of @xmath7 in the vacuum . for detailed argument on gauge transformation for this topic ,",
    "see @xcite for example .",
    "the gluon one - loop effective potential @xmath22 is expressed as @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the number of color degrees of freedom .",

    "depending on boundary conditions , we should replace @xmath29 by @xmath30 .",
    "for example , the choice of @xmath31 describes quarks with periodic boundary conditions . from here , we denote @xmath32 as effective potential of the fundamental fermion with boundary angle @xmath33 . the contribution from massive fundamental quarks",
    "is expressed by using the second kind of the modified bessel function @xmath34 as @xmath35,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the fundamental fermion mass .",
    "( we assume the same mass for all flavors . ) here the second kind of the modified bessel function @xmath37 is defined as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the gamma function .",
    "the adjoint quark contribution @xmath40 can be easily obtained by the following replacement , @xmath41 , \\label{re}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the number of flavors and the mass for adjoint fermions . for the gauge theory with @xmath44 fundamental and @xmath45 adjoint fermions with arbitrary boundary conditions ,",
    "the total one - loop effective potential is given by @xmath46 this total one - loop effective potential contains eight parameters including the compactification scale @xmath13 , the number of colors @xmath25 , the fermion masses @xmath36 , @xmath43 , the number of flavors @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and the boundary conditions @xmath33 for two kinds of matter fields .",
    "all through the present study we keep @xmath47 , then obtain phase diagram in @xmath12-@xmath43 space with @xmath36 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath33 fixed to several values .",
    "the reason we change @xmath43 while fixing @xmath36 is that gauge symmetry phase diagram is more sensitive to the former than the latter . up to this point , we work in first - principle perturbative calculations and have no model - parameter - fixing process dictated by physical results or numerical calculations",
    ".    we here comment on ability and limitation of the perturbative one - loop effective potential .",
    "this weak - coupling - limit potential at least works to investigate weak - coupling physics . in this",
    "study a small compactification scale @xmath13 ( or high temperature @xmath48 ) corresponds to weak coupling , and the @xmath12-@xmath43 phase diagram obtained from the effective potential is valid at smaller @xmath13 while the strong - coupling physics near larger @xmath13 or small temperature can not be reproduced .",
    "we note that gauge symmetry breaking due to hosotani mechanism takes place even at weak - coupling due to the compact dimension topology @xcite . indeed , the exotic phases in the recent lattice simulations @xcite have been shown to be at weak - coupling regime .",
    "our potential thus work to reveal properties of these exotic phases .",
    "now we consider contribution from the chiral sector .",
    "we introduce the four - point interaction at the action level as @xmath49 , \\label{gs}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is a two - flavor fermion field and @xmath51 is the effective coupling constant with the mass dimension minus two .",
    "( we here concentrate on the two - flavor case . )",
    "the introduction of the above term ( [ gs ] ) leads to addition of the following zero - temperature contribution to the one - loop effective potential ( [ eq_ep_pert ] ) , @xmath52,\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is a cutoff scale of the effective theory and @xmath54 stands for constituent quark mass @xmath55 with @xmath9 being chiral condensate @xcite . depending on fundamental or adjoint representations , @xmath56 takes @xmath25 or @xmath57 respectively . in the case with both fundamental and adjoint quarks ,",
    "we need two different sets of chiral sectors .",
    "the total effective potential combined with the chiral contribution is given by @xmath58 we note that this total effective potential is identical to that of the pnjl model @xcite adopting the one - loop potential as the gluon contribution , @xmath59 + { \\cal v}_{g},\\ ] ] with @xmath60 .",
    "we thus call the total effective potential ( [ pnjl - like ] ) pnjl or pnjl - based effective potential .    in the present study we will use this pnjl - based potential to study gauge theory with adjoint or fundamental quarks with periodic boundary conditions(pbc ) . in this model",
    ", we have two model parameters , the cutoff scale @xmath53 and the effective - coupling @xmath51 in addition to the eight parameters in the one - loop perturbative potential shown below ( [ eq_ep_pert ] ) .",
    "these two parameters are the very model parameters and should be fixed to reproduce physical results or first - principle lattice calculations . on the other hand ,",
    "the lattice qcd simulation on the compactified space has been done as finite - temperature lattice qcd , but for only anti - periodic boundary conditions ( apbc ) for quarks .",
    "thus , we choose the following criterion for fixing the two parameters for pbc quarks ; we first fix them so as to reproduce the zero - temperature constituent mass and the chiral critical temperature in the lattice finite - temperature qcd with apbc matters @xcite , then we use the same parameter set for the pbc case . according to @xcite , the zero - temperature constituent mass for apbc adj .",
    "qcd is given by @xmath61 and the chiral phase transition takes place at @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are critical values for chiral transition .",
    "we can fix @xmath53 and @xmath51 by using these lattice results .",
    "this method is also applied to the fundamental quarks .",
    "apart from the chiral contribution , the pnjl potential we obtained is based on perturbative calculations , and chiral properties we will obtain from it is again valid for a small @xmath13 region .",
    "in addition to this limitation , we have the cutoff scale @xmath53 in this model .",
    "it means that we can not apply the model beyond this cutoff .",
    "the model is thus valid for intermediate compactification scale as @xmath65 . in the next section we will find specific chiral properties within this limitation .",
    "we here comment on non - perturbative modification of the pnjl model . in the standard use of the pnjl model ,",
    "the gluonic contribution @xmath66 is replaced by the ",
    "non - perturbatively \"- deformed ones : in order to mimic the confinement / deconfinement phase transition in the study on qcd phase diagram , , the one - loop gluon potential should be replaced by some nonperturbative versions .",
    "we have several schemes including the simple scale introduction in ref .",
    "@xcite , center - stabilized potential in @xcite , the one - loop _ ansatz _ in ref .  @xcite and the strong - coupling lattice potential in ref .",
    "the first one in @xcite is given by @xmath67 where the second term is the modification incorporating non - perturbative effect and the mass scale @xmath68 works as a scale for confinement / deconfinement transtion .",
    "the center - stabilized potential in @xcite has a similar form given as @xmath69}_{n=1 }      \\sum_{i , j=1}^n a_{n } \\bigl ( 1 - \\frac{1}{n } \\delta_{ij } \\bigr)\\cos ( 2 n \\pi q^{ij } ) , \\label{g_np2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 in the deformation term is a mass dimension-3 model parameter , which works as the phase transition scale in this case .",
    "the one - loop ansatz potential is based on simple introduction of the scale @xmath68 to the original gluon potential as @xmath71 where some of compactification scale @xmath13 is just replaced by @xmath68 in the original potential .",

    "these two model parameters work as the scale for the phase transition .",
    "all the modifications able to reproduce the phase transition , however , it is notable that the @xmath10 gauge symmetry is explicitly broken due to the mass - dimensionful model parameters in them .",
    "it means that they do not suit our purpose of classifying the gauge - broken phases .",
    "we also emphasize that , in the first place , the exotic phases including gauge - broken phases are likely to emerge at weak - coupling region @xcite and we do not need the above deformations for the strong - coupling region for our purpose .",
    "thus , we will mainly adopt one - loop effective potential as the gluonic contribution in our pnjl model and just discuss how the phase diagram is changed by the deformation in the next section .",
