    "the possible existence of magnetic fields in the early universe has recently become the subject of intense research due to the various interesting cosmological implications  @xcite . among them",
    "is the effect that primordial magnetic fields could have had on the dynamics of the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) at temperatures of order @xmath0 gev  @xcite .",
    "it has been recently pointed out that , provided enough _ cp _ violation exists , large scale primordial magnetic fields can be responsible for a stronger first - order ewpt   in analogy with a type i superconductor where the presence of an external magnetic field modifies the nature of the superconducting phase transition due to the meissner effect .",
    "primordial magnetic fields , extending over horizon distances , can be generated for example in certain types of inflationary models through the breaking of conformal invariance  @xcite .",
    "recall that for temperatures above the ewpt , the su(2)@xmath1u(1)@xmath2 symmetry is restored and the propagating , non - screened vector modes that represent a magnetic field correspond to the u(1)@xmath2 group , instead of the u(1)@xmath3 group , and are therefore properly called _ hypermagnetic _ fields .",
    "another interesting implication of the presence of these fields during a first - order ewpt concerns the scattering of fermions off the true vacuum bubbles nucleated during the phase transition .",
    "in fact , using a simplified picture of a first - order ewpt , it has been shown  @xcite that the presence of such fields also provides a mechanism , working in the same manner as the existence of additional _ cp _ violation within the sm , to produce an axial charge segregation .",
    "the asymmetry in the scattering of fermion axial modes is a consequence of the chiral nature of the fermion coupling to hypermagnetic fields in the symmetric phase .",
    "the simplified treatment of the scattering process allows to formulate the problem in terms of solving the dirac equation with a position - dependent fermion mass  @xcite .",
    "this dependence is due to the fact that fermion masses are proportional to the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field , this last being zero in the false phase and non - vanishing in the broken symmetry phase .",
    "transmission and reflection coefficients can be computed approximately by looking into the most likely transitions from a given incident flux of particles .    nevertheless , in spite of the success of such a scheme , it is clear that a more accurate account of such processes is needed in order to set better limits that constrain the feasibility of the mechanism for axial charge segregation  @xcite .",
    "in this work , we present an exact solution to the problem of describing the propagation of a particle in two regions of different constant magnetic field , separated by an infinite plane wall , corresponding to the wall of a bubble nucleated during a first - order ewpt .",
    "the particle is massless outside the bubble , in the symmetric phase , and massive inside the bubble , in the broken - symmetry phase .",
    "the analysis is made in the infinitely thin - wall approximation to avoid unnecessary numerical complications . in physical terms",
    ", this means that the spatial region over which particle masses change is small compared to other relevant length scales such as the particle mean free path .",
    "the choice of external field captures such information , namely , changes in the magnetic field occur over large spatial regions , and thus can be considered homogeneous near the interphase .",
    "finite temperature effects are implicitly included in the treatment of the problem .",
    "one could model the change of the particle s mass with position using the so - called _ kink _ solution for the spatial profile of the higgs field  @xcite .",
    "this profile is obtained from the classical solution to the equations of motion with the finite - temperature effective potential . the wall profile considered in this work",
    "can be thought of as obtained from the kink solution in the limit where the wall thickness goes to zero .    in order to provide a working solution",
    ", we perform a numerical analysis by truncating the solution space . to present the method",

    "that momentum along the @xmath47 axis is not necessarily conserved is physically clear from the fact that translational invariance along the @xmath47 axis in this problem is lost due to the presence of the wall , as will be exemplified in the one - dimensional models in sec .",
    "we proceed to find the solution for the propagation of a particle in two regions with different constant magnetic fields , and different mass .",
    "we use the solutions found in the previous section , placing our coordinate system with the @xmath18 plane on the wall separating the two regions . for definiteness , we call region @xmath50 the half - space with @xmath51 , where the field strength is @xmath6 , the coupling constant @xmath4 , and @xmath52 , and region @xmath53 the half - space with @xmath54 , where the field strength is @xmath55 , the coupling constant @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
