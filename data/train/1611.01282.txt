    "in their recent paper  @xcite , ili and stankovi have suggested ( in remark  5.3 ) that there may be problem for the class of hybrid entropies introduced in  @xcite and elaborated in our recent paper  @xcite . in particular",
    ", they argued that the entropies in question do not satisfy the fourth axiom in generalized shannon  khinchin axioms ( j - a axioms ) introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the fourth axiom in question is basically the @xmath0-additive entropic chain rule .",
    "they do so by generalizing the single - parameter j - a axiomatics by inserting yet another independent parameter @xmath1 into axioms .",
    "the new parameter appears in the definition of the conditional entropy where it specifies the order of the weighting escort distribution .",
    "ili and stankovi have succeeded in solving their new axiomatic system and found that ensuing solutions split into 4 distinct classes : i ) @xmath2 , ii ) @xmath3 , iii ) @xmath4 and iv ) @xmath5 .",
    "interestingly enough , when @xmath6 [ i.e. special case in iv ) ] then the axioms turn out to be identical with the j - a axioms but their solution does not coincide with our hybrid entropy but rather with the usual tsallis entropy .",
    "this latter finding is particularly intriguing because tsallis entropy is not usually affiliated with the kolmogorov  nagumo means ( which explicitly enter the j - a axiomatics and ili  stankovi calculations ) .    in this comment ,",
    "we are not concerned with this , the most interesting part of ili  stankovi fine paper .",
    "rather , we seek to clarify their remarks about the rle of our hybrid entropy in their axiomatic system . instead of following the route outlined in ili ",
    "stankovi paper , we simply consider the hybrid entropy as given in  @xcite and try to see where the points of incompatibility with the j - a axiomatics arise .",
    "we do so within the framework of escort distributions , which offer a particularly illuminating tool for this task .",
    "the upshot of this analysis is that our hybrid entropies satisfy the tsallis - type @xmath0-additivity condition for any two independent events .",
    "as long as the events ( or systems ) considered are dependent , the @xmath0-additive entropic chain rule is not satisfied .",
    "we trace down the root cause of this behavior to a peculiar behavior of the de  finetti  kolmogorov relation for escort distributions .",
    "we recall first the so - called j - a axioms for hybrid entropy  @xcite , namely    1 .",

    "j - a additivity _ : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is some positive - definite invertible function on @xmath14 .",
    "the j - a axioms 1 - 4 were introduced in  @xcite as a unifying one - parameter framework for both tsallis and rnyi entropy . as such",
    ", the axioms appear quite instructive because they allow to address the currently popular concept of @xmath0-nonextensive entropies from an entirely new angle of view .",
    "of course , this is true provided some non - trivial entropy functional @xmath15 satisfying these axioms exists . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was argued that the unique solution of the j - a axioms has the form .",
    "@xmath16 here @xmath17 is the escort distribution of @xmath0-th order . before we point out the potential problem with this form ,",
    "let us discuss first the respective j - a axioms in the connection with entropy functional  ( [ hybrid ] ) .",
    "this is a worthy pursuit because a ) it allows to asses the extend of damage caused and b ) it suggests potential rectifications to be taken .",
    "in addition , maxent distributions derived from @xmath15 have a very rich practical applicability ( see , e.g . ,",
    "@xcite ) and it would be nice to retains some of the desired properties of @xmath15 even in a limited sense .",

    "\\label{13a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in view of ( [ 3])-([4 ] ) this seems to be genuinely correct and trouble - free form of the conditional hybrid entropy @xmath42 .",
    "this is even bolstered by the fact that both @xmath38 and @xmath39 are well defined for conditional distributions .",
    "however , there are two ( closely connected ) problems with the formula ( [ 13a ] ) .",
    "first problem resides in the fact that @xmath59 in the above employed de  finetti  kolmogorov relation @xmath57_{i|j}$ ] can not represent a joint probability distribution even though it derives from the genuine joint distribution @xmath60 .",
    "this is clear because the marginal distribution @xmath61 can not be obtained from @xmath59 by summing over index @xmath62 . in this connection",
    "we should recall obvious but underappreciated fact about the de  finetti  kolmogorov relation , namely that @xmath63_{k|l}$ ] for @xmath56_{k|l } = r_{k|l}^q/ \\sum_n r_{n|l}^q$ ] .",
    "this follows from the simple chain of reasonings : @xmath64 here @xmath65 denotes the correct joint distribution . the equality @xmath66 holds only when @xmath67 , for all indices `` @xmath68 '' .",
    "by subtracting two @xmath69 with different @xmath68 s on the right - hand side ( say @xmath68 and @xmath70 ) we get @xmath71 the latter can be satisfied only when @xmath72 is constant for all @xmath68 s , i.e. , when the two events involved are independent .",
    "this in turns says that @xmath59 represents a genuine joint distribution only in the case of independent events .",
    "second , should we used the defining relation ( [ eq : 2 ] ) for the conditional hybrid entropy together with the fact that @xmath73 we would obtain @xmath74 in terms of escort distributions the latter can be recast into the form @xmath75   - \\frac{(1-q)}{q}\\left[{\\mathcal{i}}_{1/q}(r(q ) ) - { \\mathcal{i}}_{1/q}(p(q))\\right ] .",
    "\\label{12aa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 .",
    "note , in particular , that ( [ 12aa ] ) differs from ( [ 13 ] ) only in the @xmath77 term .",
    "the equivalence holds if and only if @xmath78 . in order to better understand",
    "when this is satisfied we write @xmath79 and use the relation @xmath80 here we may observe that even when @xmath81 is zero for some pair @xmath82 the fraction @xmath83 is not singular . with the help of the min - max theorem for means  @xcite and eq .",
    "( [ 20ab ] ) we can write @xmath84 \\ln r(q)_{kl } \\ \\leq \\",
    "\\tilde{{\\mathcal{s}}}(r(q ) ) - { { \\mathcal{s}}}(r(q ) ) \\ \\leq \\ - \\sum_{kl } r(q)_{kl } \\left [ \\frac{\\sum_{n } ( \\max_l r_{n|l}^q - r_{n|k}^q ) } { \\sum_{n } r_{n|k}^q}\\right ] \\ln r(q)_{kl } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the left inequality is always less than or equal to zero , the right inequality is always greater than or equal to zero .",
    "clearly @xmath85 when both inequalities are saturated at the same time . according to the min - max theorem  @xcite",
    ", this happens if and only if all the @xmath86 s are equal ( i.e. , @xmath68 independent ) for each fixed @xmath8 . in other words , @xmath85 if and only if @xmath87 .",
    "so again , we can track down our problem to the fact that @xmath59 is not a true joint distribution unless events are independent .    in case",
    "we wish to retain the form of the conditional entropy obtained from  ( [ 12a ] ) as defined in the j - a axioms , it is not difficult to find corrections to the @xmath0-additive entropic chain rule .",
    "in fact , from ( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ 12aa ] ) we can see that we should employ the following substitution in the j - a additivity rule @xmath88}\\left(\\mathcal{d}_q(b|a ) + \\frac{1}{1-q } \\right ) - \\frac{1}{1-q } \\ = \\   \\mathcal{d}_q(b|a)\\   + \\ { \\mathcal{o}}(\\tilde{{\\mathcal{s}}}(r(q ) ) - { { \\mathcal{s}}}(r(q ) ) )    \\ , , \\label{22aaab}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath89 representing the error symbol .",
    "clearly the j - a additivity rule with the substitution ( [ 22aaab ] ) included reduces to the standard @xmath0-additivity form in the case when the two events are independent .    on the other hand , should we wish to retain the @xmath0-additive entropic chain rule together with the form of @xmath15 defined in ( [ hybrid ] ) we should change the the definition of the conditional entropy according to prescription ( [ 13 ] ) .",
    "in this comment we have demonstrated that the hybrid entropies @xmath15 introduced in  @xcite satisfy the tsallis - type @xmath0-additivity condition for any two independent events . as long as the events ( or systems )",
    "considered are dependent , the @xmath0-additive entropic chain rule is not satisfied .",
    "we could trace down the root cause of this behavior to a peculiar trait of the de  finetti  kolmogorov relation for escort distributions employed in the proof in ref .",
    "in particular , the latter is generally not implied by its non - escort counterpart .",
    "this is notably reflected in the fact that @xmath59 is not a joint distribution although it is constructed directly from a genuine joint distribution @xmath60 .",
    "we have shown here that @xmath59 reduces to a joint distribution only for independent events , which in turn also defines the region of validity of the @xmath0-additive entropic chain rule for @xmath15 .",
    "it should be noted , in passing , that in standard thermostatistical situations one deals only with entropies containing independent subsystems .",
    "this is fully in accord with landsberg s classification of thermodynamical systems with non - extensive entropies  @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "most of the results obtained for @xmath15 in the literature can be used safely .",
