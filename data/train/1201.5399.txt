    "the discovery of numerous dwarf galaxies through the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) over the last decade has helped to advance our understanding of the milky way in a cosmological context , with our appreciation of the galaxy as a micro - cosmos , together with our ever - growing understanding of the andromeda galaxy , leading to the development of ` near - field cosmology ' .",
    "the constellation that boasts the largest number of milky way satellites is the realm of leo , and two of its five dwarf - galaxy inhabitants form the subject of our current study .",
    "discovered by @xcite , leo iv and leo v are close neighbours not just in projection  separated on the sky by a mere @xmath1  but also spatially , sharing residence of the galactic halo beyond 150  kpc .",
    "targeted observations for studying these milky way satellites and their surrounding environment by @xcite using the laica imager on the 3.5 m telescope at the calar alto observatory led to the unexpected detection of an overdensity of stars , seemingly bridging the two galaxies .",
    "however , the loss of one of three planned fields due to bad weather unfortunately left us with only a tentative detection of the possible stellar bridge , whose true nature unfortunately could not be resolved from these data alone .",
    "follow - up observations using subaru / suprime - cam aimed at obtaining a wider and deeper dataset has enabled us to shed clearer light on the nature of this stellar overdensity , as well as allowing for an improved set of structural parameters to be derived for leo iv and leo v. these results are presented in summarised form in this contribution , with full details to be presented in a paper currently in preparation .",
    ".structural parameters of leo iv and leo v ( * updated using the current dataset ) ; from top to bottom : centroid position , position angle , ellipticity , half - light radius and heliocentric distance @xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     altogether , 16 subaru / suprime - cam fields were used to obtain a wide coverage of leo iv , leo v , and their surrounding environment .",
    "figure [ fig : footprint_leo_cmds ] provides an overview of the location of the observed fields , as well as the colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of the two leo systems ; the data have been photometrically calibrated field - by - field to the sdss , and extinction - corrected following the @xcite dust maps .",
    "the updated structural parameters , derived using a maximum - likelihood procedure as described by @xcite , are summarised in table [ tab : struct_params ] .",
    "despite the improved depth and coverage of the subaru data with respect to our earlier dataset , we identified no clear spatial overdensity indicative of a distant stellar stream in our new dataset .",
    "however , a cmd of the data from all 16 suprime - cam fields , with stars belonging to the dwarf galaxies removed , shows a feature resembling a main - sequence turn - off at @xmath2 ( see figure  [ fig : cmd_stream_isochrones ] ) .",
    "its location and profile are well matched by a 13-gyr - old stellar population roughly @xmath3 away with [ fe / h ] of approximately @xmath4 when compared with dartmouth isochrones @xcite .",
    "as can be seen from the milky way s ` field of streams ' @xcite , the stellar overdensity lying on top of leo iv and v is found near a region of the sky occupied by several prominent streams and stellar overdensities .",
    "given its currently understood properties and angular separation from the sagittarius stream , an association of the newly detected structure with sagittarius is unlikely .",
    "a connection with the nearby virgo overdensity is in fact more probable , given a close agreement in distance and metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "whatever its allegiance , the stars once thought to possibly be associated with the leos are clearly not occupants of the distant halo , but more likely members of a structure enjoying inner - halo residency .",
    "using deep subaru / suprime - cam data , we have obtained an improved set of structural parameters for the milky way dwarf galaxies leo iv and leo v. additionally and more interestingly , we find that a tentative stream of stars previously detected between the two dwarfs is part of a more extended stellar overdensity , coincidentally overlapping the satellite galaxies .",
    "previously taken as a hint of a feature related to the dwarf galaxies , the deeper and wider suprime - cam data reveal a main - sequence turn - off in the stacked cmd consistent with that of a 13-gyr - old stellar population with [ fe / h ] of @xmath5  dex at a distance of approximately 20  kpc .    while being far enough away from the multiple wraps of the imposing sagittarius stellar stream to avoid this affiliation , the on - sky proximity of the stellar overdensity enveloping leo iv and leo v to the virgo stellar overdensity , along with a comparable distance and consistent metallicity , appears to imply an association with the latter structure .",
    "indeed , our former leo stellar - bridge hopeful appears to be suffering a constellation membership crisis . instead of being trapped inside the lion s den , however , the stars of the newly detected stellar substructure manage to escape the leos jaws , only to be lured into the arms of virgo ."
