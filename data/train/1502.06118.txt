    "for a given contact 3-manifold , let us consider the 5-dimensional open book whose page is a stein filling of the contact 3-manifold and whose monodromy is the identity map .",
    "this open book supports a contact structure on the resulting closed 5-manifold , such contact structures were extensively studied , for example in @xcite ding - geiges - van koert classified a certain class of contact 5-manifolds .    from the view point of 4-dimensional symplectic topology ,",
    "it is natural to ask how the choices of stein fillings of a fixed contact 3-manifold affect the resulting contactomorphism types of @xmath3-manifolds .",
    "however , not much is known to the best of the authors knowledge . here",
    "we use the following terminology .",
    "we say that a family of 5-dimensional open books has pairwise exotic stein pages , if pages of its members are pairwise exotic ( i.e.  homeomorphic but non - diffeomorphic as smooth 4-manifolds ) , and are stein fillings of the same contact 3-manifold .",
    "recently , ozbagci - van koert  @xcite showed that infinitely many open books with exotic stein pages and the identity monodromy can support pairwise distinct contact structures on the same smooth 5-manifold .",
    "they used the exotic stein manifolds of @xcite as pages , and used @xcite to distinguish their contact structures . in this paper , we show that distinct open books with exotic stein pages can support the same contact 5-manifold , contrary to the expectation from the result of ozbagci - van koert .",
    "[ intro : thm : main ] there exists a contact 5-manifold supported by infinitely many distinct open books with pairwise exotic stein pages and the identity monodromy .",
    "in fact , any closed contact 5-manifold with @xmath4 , that is induced from the boundary of a subcritical stein manifold without 1-handles , is such an example .",
    "note that by @xcite any 6-dimensional subcritical stein manifold is the product of @xmath5 and a 4-dimensional stein manifold .",
    "therefore , contact 5-manifolds in this theorem are the contact boundary of the product of @xmath5 and stein manifolds without 1-handles .",
    "such smooth 5-manifolds are always diffeomorphic to either @xmath6 or @xmath7 with @xmath8 , and each of them admits infinitely many contact structures ( cf .",
    "@xcite , see also remark  [ rem : subcritical ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the above theorem , we also extend the aforementioned result of ozbagci - van koert .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the total space of the non - trivial @xmath10-bundle over @xmath11 , then the following holds ( they proved the @xmath12 case ) .    [ intro : thm : extension of ov ] for a closed 5-manifold diffeomorphic to either @xmath6 or @xmath7 with @xmath8 , there exist infinitely many open books with pairwise exotic stein pages and the identity monodromy which support pairwise distinct contact structures on the 5-manifold .",
    "here we outline our proofs of these results .",
    "these exotic stein pages are diffeomorphic to exotic stein fillings obtained in @xcite and @xcite . to obtain the results ,",
    "we construct new stein structures ( and hence boundary contact structures ) on these 4-manifolds .",
    "we distinguish 5-dimensional contact structures using results of @xcite .",
    "regarding theorem  [ intro : thm : extension of ov ] , we use the argument similar to @xcite .",
    "the new ingredient is 4-dimensional exotic stein fillings obtained in @xcite .",

    "[ remark : exotic_stein ] these theorems hold for any choices of stein structures on @xmath30 s , since every closed 3-manifold admits at most finitely many stein fillable contact structures up to contactomorphism ( see lemma  3.4 in @xcite ) .",

    "a result of gompf @xcite tells that @xmath72 is represented by a cocycle whose value on the 2-chain corresponding to each 2-handle of @xmath75 is the rotation number of the attaching circle of the 2-handle . since @xmath75 is simply connected , we see that @xmath76 is isomorphic to @xmath77 .",

    "see for example @xcite .",
