    "interference of photons emitted by independent sources is one of the most intriguing features of the quantum theory of light and represents a remarkable departure from classical electromagnetism @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is easily understood if the radiation is treated in terms of creation and annihilation operators , rather than by invoking the superposition principle for light waves .",
    "this purely quantum effect represents the key feature for entanglement generation needed to build linear optical quantum gates @xcite .",
    "these schemes rely on hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) effect , which is the observed coalescence of photons on the outputs of a beam splitter when they arrive simultaneously on the two input ports @xcite .",
    "since this effect is due to the bose - einstein statistics of photons , a classical wave description is inadequate to give an exhaustive picture of the phenomenon . in the long term",
    ", these gates promise to become the basic constituents of quantum computers , either in networked architecture @xcite , or adopting one - way quantum computation approach in order to build cluster states @xcite .",
    "correct functioning of these devices requires true single photon states . due to the difficulty of generating such non classical states @xcite",
    ", to date parametric down conversion ( pdc ) has been widely used @xcite , where high frequency pump photons are non - deterministically converted to pairs of frequency entangled daughter photons in a passage through a non - linear crystal .",
    "independent photons can be produced via two independent pdc processes @xcite : of the two photons generated in each down conversion event , one is detected to herald the presence of its twin which is subsequently sent to the non - classical interferometer .",
    "it is important to distinguish between imperfections intrinsic to the gate architecture and those which come from non - ideality of the soure @xcite .",
    "pdc processes is represented generate two photon states in the form @xmath0 , with @xmath1 .",
    "higher order terms can not be discriminated without photon number resolving detectors , which are not widely available .",
    "crucially , the frequency correlations of the interfering photons with their twins can introduce distinguishability and , consequently , _ welcher weg _ ( which path ) information .",
    "the presence of such knowledge intrinsically reduces the visibility of the interference and the level of entanglement of the state generated by the quantum gate @xcite .",
    "many efforts have been devoted in designing pdc sources with engineered spectral correlations @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we give a theoretical analysis of the maximal entanglement which can be produced operating a linear optical gate with independent pdc photons .",
    "this is an important diagnostic for quantum gate engineering , in which we wish to know the contribution of the imperfections of the source to the error budget @xcite .",
    "note that a first detailed sketch of such a calculation can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the effect of frequency correlation on entanglement swapping and multi - photon entanglement generation is studied .",
    "the results presented here represent a more general and detailed approach .",
    "our picture begins with the theoretical treatment of down conversion in ref.@xcite , restricting , for the sake of clarity , to the paraxial approximation and considering the pumping with a plane wave beam in mode locking regime .",
    "specifically , we want to calculate the optimal visibility in experiments of interference of two _ single photons _ , each one coming from a frequency entangled pair , given the spectra of the pump fileds .",
    "the interferometric apparatus is the one shown in fig . 1 :",
    "photons 1/ 2 , and 3/4 are pairwise produced in two distinct down - conversion processes .",
    "consequently , photons 1 and 4 are directly coupled to the detection to provide the trigger signal , while photons 2 and 3 interfere on a beam splitter with transmittance @xmath2 and reflectance @xmath3 .",
    "consider , for instance , the pdc event occurring in the upper crystal in fig.1 .",
    "the pump beam , traveling on the @xmath4 direction , has a frequency spectrum @xmath5 around a central value @xmath6 ; @xmath7 describes the distribution of the frequencies and @xmath8 their phase relation with respect the central wavelength . in a single event ,",
    "the pump generates of two fields at frequencies @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with wavevectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively . in these conditions ,",
    "the two - photon wavefunction is given by , @xmath13 up to a normalization factor .",
    "effects due to the finite size of the crystal are neglected . in the other crystal ,",
    "a similar process occur ; the second pump beam is chosen to have the same central frequency @xmath6 , and a spectrum @xmath14 .",
    "the operator describing the photon annihilation due to its measurement is , @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 represents the annihilation operator on mode @xmath18 at the frequency @xmath19 . in the expression above we adopt gaussian frequency filters , with central wavelength @xmath20 and full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath21 in front of the detectors : these define the coherence time of the photons .",
    "we choose the same ( degenerate ) frequency @xmath22 and the same fwhm for the four filters , since experiments are usually run near these conditions .",
    "specifically , the measured fields at the time @xmath23 are given by the annihilation operators : @xmath24 where @xmath25/c , @xmath26 optical path of @xmath27th photon , c is the speed of light , and @xmath28 is the optical delay between the two arms @xcite .",
    "the fourfold coincidence rate is , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is shorthand for the differential @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "this integral is taken over the coincidence window we choose in our experiment ; since typically this is much larger than the coherence time of the photons , and of the duration of the pump pulse , we can take integrals on infinite intervals @xcite .",
    "the calculation is then reduced in evaluating the amplitude , @xmath32 we use the coordinate transform @xmath33 .",
    "we also introduce frequency detuning for the pdc : @xmath34 .",
    "notice that @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "finally , it is found to be more convenient to express the amplitude in terms of the differences @xmath37 , @xmath38 , thus ,    @xmath39    we neglect a global phase and normalization constants which are unnecessary for our calculations , since we will deal exclusively with ratios .",
    "if the integration over the frequencies is carried out we arrive to the expression :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is given by the convolution @xmath42 @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the fourier transform of the pump spectrum .",
    "@xmath45 is defined in a similar way for the second pump .",
    "the degree of indistinguishability in hom interference is measured by its visibility , defined as @xmath46 , with @xmath47 the coincidence rate at optimal temporal superposition of wavepackets ( occurring at a delay @xmath48 ) and @xmath49 the rate in absence of interference .",
    "we thus can express @xmath50 in terms of the amplitude @xmath51 ,    @xmath52}{i_n } , \\label{visib}\\ ] ]    where we have defined ,    @xmath53    @xmath54    a physical interpretation of the integral @xmath55 is not straightforward ; nevertheless , it is evident that not only the time symmetry of each profile is involved , but also non trivial correlations between the two pump pulses .",
    "the fact that visibility is linked to the pump temporal profile in such a non trivial way , stresses the fact that this interference process is much more demanding than the one with correlated photon . the same pulse shape that gives a perfect hom effect with frequency entangled photons , could be only partially suitable to reach high visibilities with independent photons .",
    "as a function of filter bandwidth @xmath21 in absence of phase dispersion .",
    "top : both pump spectra are gaussian profiles with the same fwhm @xmath56 .",
    "different plots correspond to different values of @xmath57 .",
    "bottom : the two gaussian spectra have different fwhm s .",
    "plots relative to different ratios @xmath58 are shown for the case @xmath59 nm . ]",
    "we can derive a simpler form for @xmath60 in the case of infinitely large filters .",
    "in this case , we find @xmath61 by invoking parseval s theorem , we can rewrite in the frequency domain @xmath62 where the star denotes the convolution .",
    "more generally , a sufficient condition for achieving near perfect visibility is that the convolutions have to be solutions of the integral equation : @xmath63 it can be demonstrated that the condition of maximum visibility correspond to pump pulses which are much narrower in time than the coherence time imposed by the filters . in fact , the solutions of equation are @xmath64 ; this are obtained by replacing @xmath65 with a dirac distribution .",
    "substitution in and leads to the maximum visibility @xmath66 and gaussian modulation of the interference pattern observed with correlated photons @xcite .",
    "the considerations above indicate which physical process spoils the visibility @xcite .",
    "when monochromatic pump beams are used , this imposes a very strict correlation to the frequency of the pdc photons .",
    "hence , within the bandwidth of the filters some four photons events that do not interfere , since the wavelength of the two trigger photons may be used to reconstruct the path information . for instance , consider the event in which , after the beam splitter , photons 1 and 2 have exactly the frequency @xmath67 , and photons 3 and 4 are slightly detuned at the sides of the filter bandwidth .",
    "this can be realized by a unique configuration , viz .",
    "photons 1 and 2 from the first crystal and photons 3 and 4 from the second one .",
    "no event with the same wavelengths can be observed when photons 1 and 3 belong to the first pair and photons 2 and 4 to the second pair .",
    "when the frequency correlation is smoothed by adopting broader pump beams , such an information is erased and , consequently high visibility is restored .",
    "this descends from the fact that we introduced further four photon events which now cancel the ones previously non interfering .",
    "this process has been individuated as the responsible for degradation of polarization entanglement in similar experiments of multi - photon entanglement creation from entangled pairs @xcite .    as an example",
    ", we consider a gaussian spectrum with chirping , @xmath68 which gives in the convolution of eq .",
    ", @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "a similar expression holds for @xmath45 .",
    "figure 2 show the maximum visibility @xmath71 as a function of the filter bandwidth without chirping .",
    "this is plotted for the condition of expected maximum visibility @xmath72 .",
    "we find that high visibility is achieved with narrow filters and short duration hence large bandwidth pulses .",
    "an imbalance in the bandwidth for the two pulses appears as a further source of distinguishability ; fig .",
    "2 also show variations in the visibility curve as the ratio @xmath73 varies .",
    "it is clear that the control on this parameter does nt need to be extremely accurate to achieve satisfactory values ; what primarily influences the visibility is the presence of a narrower bandwidth pump pulse , rather than the imbalance of the two pump bandwidths .",
    "phase dispersion effects of the second order are far less important .",
    "the second order coefficient @xmath74 is responsible for a broadening in time of @xmath44 with respect the non chirped case .",
    "when narrow filters are used , its effects are negligible if the ratio @xmath75 remains of the order of few units .",
    "the linear coefficient @xmath76 describes a shift on the time axis , and can be use to described time jitter between the two pulses .",
    "when the pump beams are synchronous ( @xmath77 ) , maximum visibility occurs at @xmath78 ; if the following pulses are separated by a jitter time @xmath79 ( i.e. @xmath80 ) the interferometer is not working at its best delay , consequently , the visibility decreases to the value @xmath81 .",
    "an average over the total measurement time leads to the expected value @xmath82 , being @xmath83 a proper distribution for the jitter @xcite .",
    "as said , hom effect is the basic ingredient for building linear optical gates @xcite . in particular",
    ", we can adopt interference on a partially polarizing beam splitter with @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) for the horizontal-@xmath86 ( vertical-@xmath87 ) polarization to realize a non - deterministic controlled - sign gate @xcite .",
    "the model depicted above can be utilized to calculate how much frequency entanglement affect the performance of such a gate when it is used for entanglement generation .",
    "we describe entanglement generation via a partially polarizing beamsplitter with @xmath88 and @xmath89 , where extra losses on vertical modes are induced in order to obtain a correct balancement in the entangled state . in this architecture",
    ", vertical photons never meet at the surface of the beam splitter , while horizontal photons undergo hom effect .",
    "this realizes the controlled interaction , together with post - selection via measurement .",
    "if a pair of photons with diagonal polarization @xmath90 impinges on the beam splitter , by post - selecting coincidence events we generate the entangled state , @xmath91 since @xmath92 events are erased by the interference . in the non ideal case ,",
    "the polarization couples to the wavefunction of the pair in the time domain , leading to the following expression for the state of the pair , @xmath93 where @xmath94 describes the time behavior without interference , and @xmath95 is the time behavior with interference . ideally , we would have @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "the state can be rewritten as , @xmath98 where @xmath99 , and @xmath100 is an orthogonal vector to @xmath94 . by tracing out the temporal part , the polarization density matrix is obtained , @xmath101 being @xmath102 the non - normalized vector @xmath103 . in the case under investigation , we can identify up to the normalization , @xmath104 consequently , we find , @xmath105 in the case in which @xmath55 is a real function .",
    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath106 and @xmath107 reach their ideal values in correspondence of the optimal visibility @xmath108 .",
    "a simple relation between the visibility and the degree of entanglement in the state , quantified via the tangle @xcite is found , @xmath109    the plot in fig .",
    "3 shows the behavior of this curve as a function of the relative visibility @xmath110 ; it is clear that the degree of entanglement rapidly is degraded as the visibility decreases .",
    "tangle remains well under the value 0.9 , even for values of the visibility which are commonly considered more than satisfactory in experiments .",
    "thus , the maximum attainable entanglement strongly depends on the choice of the pump and the detection bandwidths , as shown in fig . 4 for the case of gaussian pumps .",
    "a comparison of the figures indicates that tangle is a much stricter criterion in designing an experiment .",
    "the results obtained above neglect the finite size of the crystal and the effect of phase dispersion of the pdc photons ; therefore they remain valid in the limit of short crystal .",
    "so far we have disregarded the fact that the crystals have finite thickness .",
    "if this is taken into account , the state has to be modified as @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the function describing non - perfect phase matching .",
    "the amplitude is modified by substituting @xmath113 with the convolution , @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the two dimensional fourier transform of @xmath112 .",
    "a similar substitution should be carried out for the second pump beam .    in the case of degenerate type ii phase matching ,",
    "this can be approximated as @xcite , @xmath116 being @xmath117 and @xmath118 constants which depend on the length @xmath119 and the dispersion in the crystal , viz .",
    "@xmath120 where @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) is the group velocity dispersion for an ordinary ( extraordinary ) beam at the frequency @xmath20 . in this case , the expression for its transform is , @xmath123 which leads to the result , @xmath124 note that in the short crystal limit @xmath125 , we restore the expression @xmath126 . in the opposite limit of infinite crystal",
    "the correlation becomes perfect @xmath127 being @xmath128 linearly dependent on the crystal length @xmath119 , the ratio @xmath129 remains finite when passing to this limit .",
    "such a correlation implies that a pdc pair with a frequency mismatch @xmath130 can be generated only by the component of the pump beam detuned of @xmath131 .",
    "therefore , it can reduce the advantage of using a broad spectrum pump , since the crystal itself limit the matching bandwidth . as an example , in fig .",
    "5 the results for degenerate type ii pdc from a 400 nm pump pulse are shown for two widely adopted materials : lib@xmath132o@xmath133 ( lbo ) , and bab@xmath134o@xmath135 ( bbo ) . the pump bandwidth is 5 nm , while the detection filters are chosen to have 2 nm fwhm : in the ideal case , these values give near perfect visibility .",
    "it is clearly shown that the finite size of the crystal can be neglected for thicknesses in the range 2 mm to 4 mm .",
    "this is the size of bulk crystal slabs commonly adopted in experiments . at these wavelength ,",
    "the adoption of lbo instead of bbo reduces the distinguishability effect . anyway that would cause a significant reduction in the brightness of the source , given the smaller nonlinearity of lbo .    as a final remark",
    ", we note that when using type ii pdc it is convenient to use the signal photons as triggers and the idler photons in the interferometer .",
    "in fact , distinguishability of signal and idler photons can arise from different dispersion in the pdc crystal due to birefringence .",
    "800 nm pdc , for two widely adopted materials , lbo and bbo .",
    "the pump bandwidth is 5 nm , the detection bandwidth is 2 nm .",
    "this choice gives near unity visibility in the ideal case .",
    "sellmeier coefficients are taken from ref.@xcite ]",
    "the results we have presented indicate that when running entangling gates with independent pdc photons , large bandwidth pulses are somehow preferable to narrow ones .",
    "their adoption reduces the _ welcher weg _ knowledge in the interference process coming from frequency entanglement .",
    "we showed that visibility has to be considered a forgetful parameter in the design of these experiments .",
    "the non trivial relation between tangle and visibility implies that the conditions to fulfill to attain a high level of entanglement are stricter than those for reaching near perfect visibilities .",
    "such an effect of frequency correlation can be easily reduced by properly choosing pumping and detection conditions with existing materials .",
    "further investigation of this process can include the effects of group velocity dispersion on the arrival time of the pdc photons , resulting in a time jitter @xcite    at a first sight , it might seem counterintuitive that broadband pumping is better than single mode pumping ; in fact it has been commonly observed that interference of dependent photons in pulsed regime is more difficult to reach than with cw pumping . nevertheless , using a mode locked pump _ per se _ does not present in principle limitations . for the independent photon case ,",
    "the actual temporal shape of the pump pulse is crucial , since knowledge comes from non trivial correlations between the pump pulses . in real life implementations ,",
    "other sources of imperfections may impose restrictions on pump and detection bandwidth , e.g. dispersion in dielectric mirrors , wavelength - sensitive performance of beam splitters .",
    "furthermore , restricting the duration of the pump pulses is less resilient to jitter and narrow detection filter reduce the apparent brightness of the source , leading to longer measurement times .",
    "we wish to acknowledge t.j .",

    "this work has been supported in part by the australian research council , and the us disruptive technologies office .",
    "during the refereeing process of this manuscript , we become aware of a paper presenting a similar treatment @xcite .                                                                in actual experiments ,",
    "the coincidence window has to be also chosen shorter than the inverse repetition rate of the mode locked pump , in order to avoid accidental coincidence counts due to subsequent pulses ."
