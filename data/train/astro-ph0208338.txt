    "in terms of frequency of occurrence , the most common morphology for galaxies in the universe are the irregular ( irr ) strain @xcite .",
    "irregulars may serve as morphological rosetta stones bridging the low and high redshift universe @xcite .",
    "historically , drawings of irrs may be found as early as 1847 ( the large magellanic cloud , classified by hubble as an irregular , was sketched by sir john herschel in that year ) . when imaged in the near  infrared ,",
    "a handful of irregulars betray a magnificent  albeit weak  spiral density wave ; examples are ngc 5195 and ngc 922 ( the latter galaxy even shows spiral arm modulation ) .",
    "generally , however , there is no decoupling of the population i and population ii disks ; many optical irregulars remain irregular in the near  infrared .",
    "one of the most intriguing questions yet to be answered is exactly what triggers / drives the formation of stars in galaxies .    here",
    "the irr species offer unprecedented opportunities , for they are excellent laboratories in which one can examine the star formation process and its influence on the interstellar medium ( ism) often in the complete absence of spiral density waves .",
    "furthermore , the existence of fossil interacting features in some of these galaxies makes them worthy of detailed study @xcite .",
    "the global study of the kinematical behavior of the gas in such environments is dynamically important .",
    "the presence of embedded superbubbles , giant regions , filaments , supernova remnants ( snrs ) and their combined effects , makes the global velocity field of irregular galaxies both stimulating and important to analyze .",
    "the face of the galaxy , a nearby magellanic type irr galaxy , is highly peculiar , with h@xmath7 streamers and filaments everywhere .",
    "not only does present giant regions , but also a snr , superbubbles , and a diffuse emission ( which embraces almost the entire optical boundary ) .",
    "the faint h@xmath7 filament population alluded to above is intriguing ; the filaments delineate the inner edge of a 2 kpc diameter supershell @xcite located at the northwest side of the main optical body . at other wavelengths ,",
    "there is a body of evidences suggesting a close connection between the diffuse nebulae , the diffuse emission and the x  ray emission from the center to the west of the main body @xcite . as in the large magellanic cloud ,",
    "the galaxy presents a bar  like morphology ; it is located at a distance of 3.7 mpc @xcite .",
    "is not isolated in the sky ; it is a member of the cvn i cloud which includes a number of i m dwarfs and galaxies such as ngc 4214 , ngc 4244 and ic 4182 . for a list of relevant parameters ,",
    "the reader is referred to table  [ parameters ] .",
    "shows an unusually rich distribution of blue supergiant stars at its northern periphery @xcite ; this conclusion has been enhanced by ultraviolet ( uv ) imaging @xcite .",
    "the uv results indicate that the uv  emitting populations ( ob complexes ) lie in the northern part of , while direct propagation of star formation appears possible south of the bar .",
    "the latter conclusion was reached using the h@xmath0/fuv(2231 ) ratio , from which age estimations of the ob complexes of this galaxy were derived , indicative of gradients in stellar age .",
    "the direct propagation of star formation in places this galaxy as one of a handful besides our , @xcite and a couple of ob associations and nebulae @xcite where sequential star formation has been discerned and measured @xcite .",
    "the morphological and dynamical peculiarities in are also reflected in its and ionized gas contents .",
    "the neutral gas in the outer parts of @xcite seems to be counter rotating relative to the ionized gas distributed in the inner disk @xcite .",
    "this counter rotation implies the co  existence of two physical systems rotating in opposite directions in this galaxy . in irrs , this behavior has only be seen in a few examples : @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as does the lmc , has a significant magnetic field , a fact which has only recently emerged @xcite .",
    "one of the conclusions reached in these studies is that the existence of a global magnetic field is possible even for small values of galactic rotation ( v@xmath8 @xmath9 30 km s@xmath3 ) .    the relatively small distance of earmarks this specimen for detailed kinematical studies .",
    "the first fabry  perot ( fp ) interferometric analysis of this galaxy was performed photographically with a fixed gap fp etalon by @xcite , who determined radial velocities for the more prominent complexes of regions in a spatial field of 5@xmath105 arcmin .",
    "other researchers who employed scanning fps to study the kinematics of the gas in are @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the observations in @xcite were spatially limited ( 3 arcmin square area ) and kinematical interpretations were aggravated due to a loss of parallelism in the etalon plates . @xcite and @xcite focused their work on the study of supersonic velocity dispersions in the brightest regions and those regions belonging exclusively to the bar .",
    "finally , conventional kinematic studies by means of classic , long slit spectroscopy for abound in the literature ; many projects have been devoted to the most prominent regions as well as to the filament and superbubble populations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    in the present analysis",
    ", we revisit the analysis of the kinematics of the ionized gas in as a part of a long term project focused on the study of the interrelationship between gas and stars in irregular galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this study presents , for the first time , a tridimensional kinematical analysis of the entire , optical distribution of the ionized gas in .",
    "earlier studies had been undertaken by means of longslit spectroscopy and fp interferometry , but focused only on localised objects ( such as ionised hydrogen regions ) or otherwise , in a smaller field of view compared to the present work .    in section 2",
    "we describe the fp observations and data reduction .",
    "the global , optical morphology in four optical lines are presented in section 3 , as is a statistical analysis of the region population .",
    "the kinematics of local ( regions ) and global scale features ( diffuse ionized gas , global velocity field ) are discussed in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to dynamical results  as deduced from our optical rotation curve . in section 6",
    "we compare our kinematical results with published ones .",
    "finally , in section 7 , we present our conclusions .",
    "the observations were carried out during four runs with the unam scanning fabry  perot interferometer puma , attached to the f/7.9 ritchey  chrtien focus of the 2.1 m  telescope at the observatorio astronmico nacional at san pedro mrtir , b.c .",
    "the log of the observations is described in table  [ observations ] .",
    "the puma setup is composed of a scanning fp interferometer , a focal reducer with a f/3.95 camera , a filter wheel , a calibration system and a tektronix 1k@xmath101k ccd detector @xcite .",
    "other components of the instrumental setup used in each run , are the same as described in table 2 of @xcite .",
    "depending on the ccd reading ( bin = 1 , 2 or 4 ) , the pixel size is 058 , 117 or 234 , respectively . at our assumed distance (",
    "see table  [ parameters ] ) , the pixel linear ",
    "size is equivalent to 10.5 , 21 and 42 pc , respectively .",
    "a 10@xmath11 field of view is spanned , embracing the entire optical extent out to the de vaucouleurs 25 mag arcsec@xmath12 isophote .",
    "we obtained a set of direct images in three runs in the lines of h@xmath0 , [ ] ( @xmath13 6717 , 6731  ) , [ ] ( @xmath13 6584  ) and [ ] ( @xmath13 5007  ) using the puma in its direct image mode , i.e. without the fp on the optical axis . for their calibration",
    ", we have observed , under the same conditions , the spectrophotometric standard star bd+25@xmath143941 @xcite . in the fourth run",
    "we exclusively used the h@xmath0 filter for direct imaging : see section 3 and table  [ observations ] for more details of these observations . in the third run , the seeing in the direct images of images which were later used to perform our flux calibration was of the order of 2@xmath15 ( fwhm ) .",
    "in addition , we have obtained scanning fp data cubes in the lines of h@xmath0 and [ ] .",
    "the fp data cubes are composed of 48 steps covering the entire spectral range , with integration times of 60 seconds per step . in this configuration , the final data cubes had dimensions of 512@xmath10512@xmath1048 ( after applying a binning of two ) .",
    "we have obtained 2 data cubes per filter ; the total exposure time was 1.6 hours in each case .",
    "the measured seeing in these data cubes is of the order of 27 ( fwhm ) .",
    "fp data reductions ( phase calibration and kinematical analysis ) were carried out in the same manner as in @xcite , mainly using the software package cigale @xcite .",
    "the photometry was performed under iraf .",
    "our data cubes in h@xmath0 are contaminated with night  sky lines such as the lines of oh at 6568.78   and 6568.77  .",
    "these night  sky lines fall inside the main emission of , centered at channel 14 or at the heliocentric velocity + 295 km s@xmath3 ( in the redshifted wing of single velocity profiles ) . such night  sky lines have been subtracted using an interactive routine of cigale and consequently our radial velocity dispersions are free of them .",
    "the [ ] data cubes are less contaminated by night ",
    "sky lines ; however , the s / n ratio is not as good as for the h@xmath0 cubes and are only used to compare and to complement the h@xmath0 observations .    to extract the kinematic information from the fp data cubes , we adopt the same methodology described in @xcite .",
    "the radial velocity profiles were fitted by gaussian functions once deconvolved with the instrumental function ( an airy function ) .",
    "we also constructed a set of maps , or moment maps .",
    "the first moment is given by the radial velocity map , which cigale calculates by finding the barycenter in the radial velocity profile of each pixel .",
    "cleaning this map at 2 @xmath16 times the value of the standard background emission , ensures that the remaining features are galactic .",
    "the second moment map or the velocity dispersion map , was derived using the adhoc package @xcite .",
    "besides our moment maps , cigale obtained a monochromatic map after integration of the radial velocity profile ( velocity versus intensity along the 48 channels ) of each pixel , up to a certain fraction of the peak ( usually 70% ) .",
    "this map enables us to separate the monochromatic emission from the continuum @xcite .      to accomplish the flux calibration of our h@xmath0 data ,",
    "the direct images of the standard star bd+25@xmath143941 and the direct images of the galaxy ( see previous section and table  [ observations ] for details ) were reduced and analysed in the usual way . in this manner , our conversion factor ( to secure absolute calibrated surface brightnesses ) was : 1 count s@xmath3 pix@xmath3 = 1.266@xmath1010@xmath17 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 steradian@xmath3 , which in units of flux is : 1.018@xmath1010@xmath18 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 . for images binned by a factor of two",
    ", 1 count s@xmath3 pix@xmath3 corresponds to 3.165@xmath1010@xmath19 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 steradian@xmath3 .",
    "given that presents a conspicuous diffuse component pervading almost all of its disk and taking into account that this component is more intense towards the ne ",
    "sw bar @xcite , we considered it appropriate to subtract such diffuse emission only on our direct images , in order to determine the region diameters more accurately . for the datacubes , we used another scheme to separate the diffuse emission ; that methodology will be explained in the next section .    to subtract the diffuse emission in our h@xmath0 direct image of",
    ", we used the technique ( well known in photometry ) of median filtering . in our case ,",
    "the best filter was that with a square box of 97 pixels .",
    "this filter has to be at least 3 times greater ( in spatial area ) than the most extended feature to be analysed , in order to ensure reliable h@xmath0 counts ( after subtraction of the filtered image from the direct one ) .",
    "once the diffuse emission was subtracted , the background was removed at 3 @xmath16 of its mean value , to ensure galactic membership of the remaining features .",
    "the resulting image is shown in figure  [ cali_free_dig ] .",
    "however , some local background persisted , especially at the bar , where the crowding is high .",
    "this effect can be seen in our figure  [ cali_free_dig ] and figure 7 in @xcite .",
    "the next step was to define the region boundaries .",
    "later , these were used as apertures from which our photometry was performed .",
    "polygonal apertures were chosen so as to contain all emission from a given region ( figure  [ apertures ] ) .",
    "special care was taken with objects embedded in crowded regions , given that the limits between individual regions and the local background were problematic , even when the diffuse emission had been eliminated . in a crowded region",
    "( such as the bar ) the definition of the apertures was carried out by locally setting a contour map of the complex , to determine the relative contribution of each embedded region .",
    "pixels within the apertures were then summed to generate the total area and the total counts for every region .",
    "the total h@xmath0 flux for each region was obtained by multiplying the resulting counts by the calibration conversion factor .",
    "our resulting h@xmath0 fluxes for the regions are presented in column 4 in table [ parameters_1 ] .",
    "the uncertainty in the derived fluxes of crowded regions ranges from @xmath2010% for the brightest objects , to 30% for the faintest regions .",
    "the lowest and highest levels for which we have reliable data in our cataloged regions are : 1.9@xmath1010@xmath21 and 3.38@xmath1010@xmath22 erg s@xmath3 , respectively ; these values correspond to a surface brightness of 6.309@xmath1010@xmath19 and 1.047@xmath1010@xmath23 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 steradian@xmath3 .",
    "the lowest value corresponds to our region m92 , and the highest one is found in our region m32 .",
    "the h@xmath0 luminosity of the latter region ( m32 ) is approximately 1/5 that of the h@xmath0 luminosity for 30 doradus ( 1.5@xmath1010@xmath24 erg s@xmath3 ) and two orders of magnitude brighter than the orion nebula messier 42 , 10@xmath21 erg s@xmath3 , see @xcite .    at first glance , it may appear that removal of diffuse emission would help us to assign definite diameters to areas of interest ( e.g. , ionised hydrogen regions ) and hence compute fluxes coming from each such region of interest , but there are complexities , as discussed below .",
    "our h@xmath0 fluxes free of diffuse emission were compared against that obtained by @xcite , who also removed the diffuse emission in their work .",
    "fuentes - masip values resulted in brighter ones than ours , by an amount of @xmath2560% in the most extreme case , in spite of their diameters being smaller than ours .",
    "also , our best fit to fuentes - masip falls on a regression line parallel to the diagonal ( slope@xmath26 ) .",
    "hence , in order to explore the importance as to whether we should subtract the diffuse emission in the region photometry , we compared the fluxes obtained by @xcite(diffuse emission included ) against those of fuentes - masip ( free of diffuse emission ) .",
    "the chosen regions were sb89 , 108 , 114 , 133 , and 208 .",
    "the difference in log ( l ) was 0.6 in the worst case , with the fuentes - masip values always brighter than hill s ; recall that hill s apertures were larger , and had diffuse emission included . in the light of such results , we decided it appropriate to apply our polygonal apertures ( defined without diffuse emission ) on the monochromatic image ( diffuse emission included and transformed to bin=1 ) and to compute fluxes .",
    "our flux determinations were compared against published data by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the regions chosen to compare were selected from @xcite and @xcite lists .",
    "they also were chosen to be relatively isolated , round and intense ( especially in the case when a region was embedded in the bar ) .",
    "figure [ comparison ] shows the comparison . in this figure",
    "it can be seen that our fluxes are in excellent agreement with those of @xcite , for two bright complexes at the bar .",
    "our discrepancies with @xcite probably are given by the uncertainty in the positions of the apertures .",
    "with respect to @xcite , our comparison to their values results in a fit with a slope value ( b=0.99 ) parallel to the diagonal , where the fuentes - masip values are in general , brighter than ours .",
    "the correlation ( @xmath27@xmath250.9 ) found in such fit , is high .",
    "this fact points towards the homogeneity in our data and a systematic effect produced by the fuentes - masip method of subtracting the diffuse emission and the influence of such effect in the acquisition of their fluxes .    to obtain luminosities ,",
    "our fluxes were corrected for galactic foreground extinction , even though in the direction of , it is negligible : a@xmath28=0.2 mag @xcite .",
    "the effects of internal extinction were not taken into account ; they are not crucial in kinematical studies @xcite .",
    "the region apertures rectangular boxes in this case in which the kinematical analysis was performed , were assigned using different criteria compared to the scheme followed in the direct imaging mode .",
    "the reason is due to the fact that we did not want to apply any filtering technique on our datacubes to eliminate the diffuse emission .",
    "this could otherwise introduce a systematic effect over the continuum level at each pixel , as a consequence of such filtering .",
    "therefore , as a first step as is customary in the analysis of fp data the boundaries were determined checking all the velocity maps in which emission was detected for a given region . in this way , by inspecting each 0.41  we were sure that contamination by diffuse emission was not important .",
    "moreover , we only took as ` valid ' detections , only those detected in two successive velocity maps .    in order to check if our fp box boundaries were effectively free ( and not contaminated ) by diffuse emission , we superimposed our fp boxes on the fp monochromatic image in which the regions were clearly delineated ( such monochromatic images were cleaned of diffuse emission , as previously described in subsection 2.1 ) .",
    "we next superimposed our fp boxes on the filtered direct image .",
    "the comparison was highly satisfactory ; only in some cases did we need to marginally redefine our boxes .",
    "for some regions embedded in the bar , we secured local contours to examine the relative contribution of the different components and in this way , to assign our box boundaries .",
    "the boxes are shown in section 4.2 .",
    "the resulting catalog of kinematic properties ( table  [ parameters_2 ] ) differs from that in table  [ parameters_1 ] ; this may be ascribed to different binnings in each case ( see table  [ observations ] for details ) .",
    "figure [ direct ] shows the emission of in the lines of h@xmath0 , [ ] , [ ] and [ ] as obtained from our direct images in the second run ( see section 2 and table  [ observations ] for more details ) . in these images it can be seen that the dimensions of the galaxy s main body at the adopted distance are approximately 4@xmath294 or 4.8 kpc and 2@xmath297 or 3 kpc for its major and minor axes ( not shown ) , respectively .",
    "seen at these large scales , the h@xmath0 and [ ] global emission of appears to be mainly concentrated toward the south , where copious numbers of region complexes , superbubbles and filaments are found .",
    "however , the presence of filaments and superbubbles is not related exclusively to the main body : an  arc \" of emission is visible at the west from the photometric center as far as 2@xmath296 or 2.8 kpc .",
    "such a feature is referred to in other works as arc 156157 @xcite or sgs3 @xcite , and it is better seen in h@xmath0 and [ ] .",
    "the most prominent spatial extent of emission is located , in projection , along the bright bar  which extends from ne to sw and whose morphology is conspicuous in all the filters . along",
    "the bar lies a hugely strong continuum whose location corresponds to the photometric center .",
    "this feature has been referred to as a `` nucleus '' and its nature has been recently analysed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the results of these works points towards the existence of a young super star  cluster embedded at that location : a fact which is possibly related to the previous interactions suffered by this galaxy .",
    "moreover , the bar possesses a pervasive diffuse ionized gas component .",
    "this diffuse gas also embraces almost the entire optical extent of the galaxy , as we have already alluded to .    to the north of , the bright complexes cm46 and cm39 @xcite emit more strongly in h@xmath0 , [ ] and [ ] compared to [ ] , where they look dimmer .",
    "the snr previously reported ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* also known as region sb187 ) is located in our images at the sw border of our region m77 or v61 ( see tables [ parameters_1 ] and [ parameters_2 ] ) and appears brighter in [ ] than in h@xmath0 . in our region",
    "m77(v61 ) the regions sb185 and sb187 @xcite look almost blended and embedded in a diffuse emitting region . at the borders of this complex ,",
    "the presence of the superbubble sb2 @xcite or d @xcite is unmistakable as suggested by the complexity of the radial velocity field at that locale .",
    "apart from the features above , the galaxy appears to have a fuzzy morphology in the lines of [ ] and [ ] , given that the continuum has not been subtracted .",
    "nevertheless , the bar remains as the most distinct feature in contrast to other regions with negligible emission .",
    "as far as the beautiful and sprawling filaments are concerned , these emerge in the h@xmath0 and [ ] filter images at first glance , as opposed through the [ ] and [ ] filters , where they are not well discerned ( mainly due to the diffuse emission ) .",
    "filament 6 @xcite and the bulk of filaments already reported ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , are indeed prominent in our h@xmath0 direct image . in the [ ] image ,",
    "the number of resolved filaments @xcite is less , but filament 6 remains resolved .",
    "we also have conducted h@xmath0 direct observations around the locations where some maxima have been reported @xcite .",
    "information pertaining to this run is displayed in tables  [ observations ] and [ hi_maxima ] . in table  [ observations ] , the corresponding frames are indicated with positions 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "our goal was to look for traces of star formation at those locales .",
    "however , we did not find obvious h@xmath0 emission at these three positions , although we performed an unsharp masking treatment in our images .",
    "this result agrees with the work of @xcite for positions 2 and 3 . at our position 1 , there are no other published comparisons pertaining to the issue of star formation there .      the regions of have been catalogued by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the most extensive catalogue corresponds to @xcite with 252 regions .",
    "our identifications are mainly based on this work and on the earlier work of @xcite .",
    "our observations contain 140 regions according to @xcite .",
    "two other regions not catalogued in this work are denoted in the second column of table  [ parameters_1 ] and table  [ parameters_2 ] , and demarcated as h61 and h66 according to @xcite .",
    "futhermore , regions denoted by a ",
    "v \" letter followed by a number in column 2 of table  [ parameters_1 ] , correspond to our sources listed in table  [ parameters_2 ] .",
    "the ionised hydrogen regions detected by @xcite but not by us is due to several possibilities : very weak emission ( and consequently not detected by us ) ; alternatively , some were possibly not resolved with our telescopic and fp configuration .",
    "another issue is blending : in some cases , the boundaries between diffuse regions being part of one large complex were not obvious .",
    "in such cases , we assigned them with a common boundary . taking into account all these scenarios ,",
    "only 84 and 101 regions were cleanly defined in our monochromatic and direct images respectively .",
    "table [ parameters_1 ] shows the results of our photometry performed on the regions in .",
    "columns 1 and 2 present the identifications of each source in this work and in previous ones ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and this work ) .",
    "column 3 shows the equivalent diameter ( d ) , which is defined in terms of the area ( a ) where the photometry is performed : a= @xmath30(d/2)@xmath31 .",
    "column 4 displays the logarithm of the h@xmath0 flux , derived as described in section 2.1 .",
    "finally , columns 5 and 6 show the luminosities and surface brightnesses .",
    "figure [ lum_function ] shows the h@xmath0 luminosity function for the regions in . for several galaxies",
    ", it has been shown that the brighter luminosity end of the region luminosity function can be fitted with a power law in the form : , where @xmath32 is the number of regions with luminosity @xmath33 in an interval of luminosity @xmath34 , and the slope @xmath35 is related to the morphological type of the galaxy @xcite , ranging from mean values of 2.3 ( sab  sb galaxies ) to 1.75 ( irrs ) .",
    "it also has been suggested that different ranges of the luminosity function are related to different kind of objects such as regions ionized by single stars compared to those ionized by clusters of stars @xcite .    in order to obtain the region luminosity function , we followed the procedure already described in @xcite . for",
    "the bin width was more refined than in ( * ? ? ? * with 30 regions ) , and the fit was calculated in bins brighter than @xmath36 , showing a negative slope.composite regions as m87 or m90 , were excluded in the fit .",
    "our best fit slope for gives @xmath37 .",
    "this value is in good agreement ( within our error bars ) with the value ( @xmath38 ) found by @xcite , and lie within the errors of the mean values found for a sample of irr galaxies studied by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these studies were performed on six , three , twenty  nine and four irr galaxies respectively ; only the work by kennicutt et al . includes .",
    "the region diameter distribution can be expressed as : , where is the cumulative function of regions with diameter larger than @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the characteristic diameter .",
    "this functional dependence was proposed by @xcite as an universal law for all galaxy types and it has been used to study the statistics of the region populations in combination with the region luminosity function . however , in a recent work @xcite , there appears to be a dependence of the slope in the distribution function with respect to the spatial resolution .",
    "thus , care has to be taken with regard to values in slope whose",
    "resolution data lies under 40 pc fwhm @xcite .    to calculate the distribution we have used the diameters of the regions measured on the direct h@xmath0 images ; these are to be found in column 3 in table [ parameters_1 ] .",
    "according to our definition , the equivalent diameters range from 38.8 pc ( corresponding to our region m41 ) to 184.4 pc ( for region m32 ) , with a mean value of 89.1@xmath2031.6 pc .",
    "our mean diameter value is in agreement ( within dispersion values and within adopted distance uncertainties ) with a mean value previously reported @xcite .",
    "recall that the latter study considers only 43 regions and that it also takes into account the subtraction of the diffuse emission in the determination of diameters . on the other hand ,",
    "the large dispersion found in our mean equivalent diameter accounts for the wide range in the sizes of the regions in this galaxy .    the resulting cumulative region diameter distribution @xmath41 is shown in figure [ distribution_hii ] , where we plot @xmath42 .",
    "for a least squares fit gives @xmath431@xmath4473@xmath200.1 or 31.2@xmath202.1 pc . in the calculation",
    "we have included the diameters of complexes not ring shaped which envelop more than one region .",
    "this value is in agreement with a previously published value by @xcite who obtained @xmath40=1@xmath446 .",
    "however , our value differs from that of @xcite and @xcite who quoted larger values : @xmath40= 5@xmath445 and 6@xmath442 , respectively .",
    "the disagreement here could possibly be due to the diffuse emission not being subtracted in these studies .",
    "to this end , @xcite suggest that the intrinsic clustering properties of the regions plus diffuse emission and resolution effects , do indeed hamper reliable measurements of internal quantities ( such as luminosities and diameters ) .",
    "pertaining to the correlation between @xmath40 and the absolute magnitude @xmath45 given by @xcite :    ,    when we plot our observational value ( @xmath46 ) as well as the resulting value from the above equation , @xmath47 , taking @xmath48 @xcite , the first value does not fit the correlation in figure 11 in @xcite , while the latter does .",
    "this supports the conclusion of @xcite and @xcite , who analyzed a sample of 29 irrs ( not included ) and blue compact dwarfs , and who highlighted the weakness of this correlation .",
    "in we detected h@xmath0 emission ranging from 75 to 472 km s@xmath3 in heliocentric radial velocities ; some velocity channels are displayed in figure  [ mosaic_vr ] .",
    "also , the global radial velocity profiles for all emission emanating from this galaxy has been fitted .",
    "the results are displayed in figure  [ vr_global ] . in this figure",
    "one can immediately see that the peak velocity of the whole emission is at channel 10.5 ( or 218 @xmath20 4 km s@xmath3 ) with a corrected velocity dispersion of 1.7 channels ( or 31.5 @xmath20 10 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "the other curves in that figure correspond to sky ",
    "line fittings ; curve 3 contributes to the profile in our line under study ( h@xmath0 ) , and it has been taken into account in all calculations determining radial velocities and velocity dispersions . the peak velocity can be considered the systemic velocity of the galaxy , and the velocity dispersion can be visualized as the representative value of the velocity dispersion of all the objects embedded in the disk . at this point , we do however caution that h@xmath0 velocity dispersions are subject to many factors which contribute to its broadening . in this sense",
    ", a better velocity dispersion determination can be derived from other forbidden lines .",
    "however , given the low metallicity of irrs as a class , the h@xmath0 line is invariably adopted in fp studies ( such as this one ) due to its relatively high intensity .",
    "figure [ vr_maps ] ( top and bottom left ) shows the global radial velocity field of obtained from all the detected h@xmath0 emission : regions , bubbles , filaments , as well as the diffuse emission . along the bar",
    "going to the sw , a conspicuous gradual decrement in radial velocities can be noticed ranging from approximately 250 km s@xmath3 in the ne to @xmath25 190 km s@xmath3 in the sw .",
    "this result is in excellent agreement when it is compared against previous works @xcite .",
    "we are able to conclude that the gradient in radial velocities of the gas is indeed in the opposite sense compared to the outer distribution , as was reported in an earlier study by @xcite from studies , and @xcite from h@xmath0 ones .",
    "figure  [ vr_maps ] ( bottom right ) displays the global velocity dispersion field ( corrected as indicated in section 4.2 ) . as can be seen , presents low velocity dispersion values at its eastern and western sides , no larger than 25 km s@xmath3 .",
    "however , the velocity dispersion values increases as one moves towards the interior of the galaxy , reaching 40 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the extreme values occur at the snr location , as well as at some places along the bar , with values in a range of 4560 km s@xmath3 .",
    "our results along the bar are in good agreement with the velocity dispersion map presented by @xcite , and in disagreement with @xcite , who obtained larger values ( by about a factor of two ) at the same locations .",
    "the latter authors may have precluded the signifance of a loss of parallelism in their fp plates .    the recession velocity of the nucleus ( which has been indicated with a cross in figure [ box - vel ] ) is 220 @xmath20 4 km s@xmath3 , in excellent agreement according to ( * ? ? ?",

    "* @xmath20 28 km s@xmath3 ) . with respect to our [ ] data cubes ,",
    "we generally find a good agreement ( where the signal / noise was high enough ) with other h@xmath0 radial velocity studies cited earlier in this paper .",
    "besides the ne  sw velocity decrement in radial velocities , an intruiging substructure appears in our map : two ring  like structures ( one of them located at the nw of the galaxy and embracing our regions v74 and v75 ; the other structure located at the north end of the bar enclosing our regions v18 , v34 , v49 and v53 ) are seen .",
    "such structures are noticeable in figure [ vr_maps ] ( top and bottom left ) and are comprised of both regions as well as diffuse emission .",
    "when one studies the regions alone figure  [ vr_maps ] ( top right) we note that such structures are not so apparent .",
    "we actually find a spatial correspondence of the the second ring ( described above ) with a peculiar behavior of the magnetic vectors at this location . in figure 3 of @xcite ,",
    "a divergence in the polarization vectors occurs at low values ( sometimes actually reaching zero ) , at this ring  like structure .",
    "as the optical radial velocity field is somewhat chaotic at this locale , it may be expected that magnetic fields do , to some degree , trace such gas kinematics ( beck and urbanik , priv .",
    "comm . ) .    furthermore , in figure [ vr_maps ] ( top and bottom left ) we find superbubbles , filaments and giant complexes which have also been observed in previous studies @xcite . as far as the giant filament 6 @xcite is concerned , we are able to only see it when spatial filtering was applied to our monochromatic chart .",
    "more details of our analysis in this filament and in other filaments as well as detailed results about the superbubble and snr populations will be given in a forthcoming paper ( valdez  gutirrez et al .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "extreme values in detected velocities ( such as those arising from the internal motions of the superbubble , snr and filament populations ) may not properly be deduced in our figure [ vr_maps ] since we selected our palette to enhance the velocity gradient along the major axis . however , as discussed in the next section , when the kinematics of these populations are analysed in detail , a complex and rather chaotic behavior emerges . in our map , there are some regions where abrupt radial velocity gradients appear : for example , at the north end of the bar where there are some clues that some superbubbles are blending and at the location of the superluminous snr .",
    "indeed , at the latter zone there is an hole and the filaments 5 and 6 reported by @xcite lie at the borders of an ridge .    in the surrounding velocity field outside of the bar , we find regions characterized by both large radial velocities and high velocity dispersions ( details in the next section ) , in accord with @xcite .",
    "such locations are places where filaments and superbubbles have been reported @xcite .    to explore this farther",
    ", we have analysed the radial velocity field at the seven locations where @xcite report strong radial velocity gradients ( see their figure 6 and our figure  [ dig ] top right ) . after a detailed kinematical analysis employing profile decompositions at those locales our results agree qualitatively with malumuth s and with our values reported for the diffuse ionized component ( see below ) .",
    "we also find that the seven malumuth s regions are coincident ( at least in projection ) with filaments or superbubbles . due to the presence of such objects , the scenario proposed by @xcite in which gas cloud infall is generating such kinematics ,",
    "could possibly be discarded .",
    "however , in order to elucidate the origin of the local , steep radial velocity gradients at the above mentioned locations , detailed kinematical studies have to be performed . with respect to the velocity field at those locales",
    "where ( * ? ?",
    "* see their figure 14 ) postulated that star formation propagated in a stochastic manner , we find that the radial velocity profiles there are often complex , admitting more than one component ( as can be seen in our table  [ parameters_2 ] ) .",
    "such locations spatially correspond to regimes where complexes , filaments and bubbles are seen in projection .",
    "we have already noted that the global velocity field in is moderately well behaved , but becomes increasingly chaotic as one considers smaller scales ( as discussed in the the sections which follow ) .",
    "also , the projected borders of the bar exhibits abrupt gradients in radial velocity and in velocity dispersion .",
    "what we therefore encountering here in the optical inner part of is a highly perturbed medium due to an intense star forming rate ",
    "high compared to other irrs @xcite .",
    "the star formation rate in this galaxy is undoubtedly enhanced by bar  like gravitational well .",
    "we strongly believe that all of these kinematical and dynamical features suggest a prior encounter of this galaxy with the irr .",
    "this scenario was proposed by @xcite based on data covering a spatial extent of about 67@xmath4967@xmath11 .",

    "we have already noted that presents a diffuse , ionized gaseous component which permeates almost the entire optical extent of the galaxy .",
    "the nature of the diffuse ionized gas also called dig or warm ionized medium ( wim) which is found in the form of shells , loops , and a widespread unstructured diffuse background , has become a field of intense research .",
    "review papers may be found in @xcite .    in view of the fact that our observations covered the optical disk of",

    "contrary to what we find in the local group irr @xcite , the dig in is more turbulent and reflects the influence of its activity at local scales ( see below ) and at global scales ( see next section ) .",
    "concerning dig photometric properties in , we find a gradual increment in surface brightness values as one moves from the outskirts of the galaxy towards the inner regions ( see figure  [ dig ] , top left ) . in this way ,",
    "surface brightness values at the outlying periphery of range from 3.165@xmath1010@xmath19 to 2.215@xmath1010@xmath17 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 steradian@xmath3 ( or 4.17@xmath1010@xmath62  2.91@xmath1010@xmath63 erg s@xmath3 in luminosity units ) at the inner regions surrounding the brightest complexes .",
    "these values are approximately smaller by a factor of four than those found by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figure 2 ) in the diffuse gas at the bar locations .",
    "however , our values found for the dig in the outer extremities of the disk correspond well with those found by @xcite at the locations of two loops along the bar .",

    "previous measurements of the dig fraction in this galaxy @xcite report a range of 1520% of the total h@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "the disagreement with our value undoubtedly resides in the deeper observations performed by hunter and collaborators . in the large magellanic cloud",
    ", the dig contribution is estimated to be about 1525% of the total h@xmath0 flux @xcite .",
    "these values are very small compared to the dig luminosity in some spirals , which may amount to 30% or even 50% of the total h@xmath0 luminosity @xcite .",
    "the kinematics of the dig is displayed ( according to the entire spatial distribution ) in figure  [ dig ] ( top right ) .",
    "we show there the dig s radial velocity field . to compute this ,",
    "the regions were subtracted from the whole field ( the procedure was explained earlier , in section 2.1 ) . in this map , a decreasing gradient of radial velocities from ne to sw can be noted , which follows the tendency already seen in the total ionized gas content ( regions plus dig ; see previous sections ) , and in agreement with previous results ( section 4.1 ) .",
    "locally , part of the ring  like structure ( discussed in section 4.1.1 ) , can barely be disentangled at the north end of the bar .",
    "with respect to the velocity dispersion in the widespread dig , we find an increment in their values , from the peripheral optical domains of , towards the interior of the disk .",
    "the total displayed range in velocity dispersion is @xmath2570 km s@xmath3 , varying from around 10 km s@xmath3 to @xmath2575 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the maximum value we detected lay at the east of our region v65 ( see figure  [ box - vel ] ) .",
    "moreover , values larger than 50 km s@xmath3 were also found east of the bar ( between our regions v41 , v42 and v52 ) , as well as west of the nucleus .",
    "the latter locales lie close to our boxes v56 , v83 , v84 ; also at the ne sector of the bar ( between our regions v33 ,",
    "v47 and v30 ) , and at the vicinities of the snr ( surrounding our region v55 ) .    in order to quantitatively analyse the kinematical properties in the widespread dig in",
    ", we performed a profile decomposition at a few locations .",
    "the dig radial velocity map displayed in figure  [ dig ] ( top right ) , was used to define boxes at different positions of interest .",
    "we then performed a profile decomposition within such boxes , as in section 4.2 . in this way",
    ", we could then secure kinematical properties of the dig in terms of heliocentric radial velocities and corrected velocity dispersions .",
    "the zones which displayed very peculiar profiles were those surrounding the bar , coinciding in many cases with regions where @xcite suggested a gas infall .",
    "their positions are indicated in figure  [ dig ] .",
    "these locales coincide at least in projection with positions where filaments or shells have been reported @xcite .",
    "characteristic of is its network of filaments , loops , shells , and the like .",
    "pertaining to the profile decomposition we performed at malumuth s locations ( see their figure 6 ) , we are confident they indeed are representative of the profiles at any location in the pervasive dig of . some examples of typical profiles we find at four of the @xcite locations are shown in figure  [ malumuth_profiles ] .    in general , the dig profiles are very complex ( multi  component fits required per profile ) at almost all locations . the main component in these profiles always retained values of @xmath2023 km s@xmath3 from the systemic velocity ( 220@xmath204 km s@xmath3 ) . beside this main component , we find blue and red components : the blue one having a range of 117 to 144 km s@xmath3 while the red component ranged from 275 to 332 km s@xmath3 . with respect to the velocity dispersions ,",
    "the dig values in the main component reaches up to four times the velocity dispersion of the nearest region ( see box 3 , which is spatially in contact with regions v60 , v64 and v65 ) .",
    "the resulting dig velocities and velocity dispersions were larger than the values we secured for the regions closest to the dig boxes .",
    "we do however caution that fits to more than one component at such locations are to be treated carefully , given high perturbations in the velocity field ( as already alluded to in our previous discussions ) .    from our results of the global dig maps ( both in radial velocity and in velocity dispersion ; see figure  [ dig ] ) as well as from our profile decomposition , we find that some locations inside the widespread dig in show a truly chaotic kinematical behavior .",
    "it is tempting to postulate that some of the dig locations we analysed have , as a source of their fueling , energetic photons escaping from complexes . of course for the very widespread dig over the disk of , any inference with star forming regions and dig is , at best , indirect .",
    "let us reflect back on the dynamical history of .",
    "after a likely interaction with the irr , @xcite a bar potential took form , in which gaseous infall and star formation is taking place on a highly efficient basis @xcite . other secondary manifestations ( aftermaths of the interaction ) could be the loops , shells , filaments , etc : clear signatures of the highly perturbed velocity field .",
    "indeed , a past interaction experienced by could be the crucial factor as to why the ism in this galaxy is so active and peculiar .",
    "given that we have kinematical data for the ionized gas spanning the entire optical disk , the next step is obviously to derive the rotation curve .",
    "however , we must point out that irregular galaxies invariably show low rotation velocities because of their low masses .    for",
    ", we calculate the rotation curve using the radial velocities resulting from our fp cubes .",
    "first , we use the first moment map or radial velocity chart , and we apply a mask .",
    "the mask is constructed using the monochromatic map previously cleaned at 3@xmath16 times the mean value of the background . in this way",
    ", we obtain a radial velocity field with non  zero values in the positions where there is h@xmath0 emission .",
    "we then calculate the rotation curve by using the classical formulae , as follows :    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the rotation velocity at the position @xmath69 , @xmath70 is the heliocentric radial velocity at that position , @xmath71 is the systemic velocity , @xmath72 is the azimuthal position of the data point , and @xmath73 is the inclination of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "this formulae assumes that the major axis is oriented at @xmath74 .",
    "we have developed a program which calculates the rotation curve once the central pixel , the systemic velocity , and the position and inclination angles ( only points in @xmath75 around the major axis are specified ) .",
    "we compute the difference between the receding and approaching portions of the disk at any galactocentric radius .",
    "while this method works well for spiral galaxies , caution should be exercised in the case of irregulars , with their low rotation velocities and their intrinsic disk asymmetries .    for this galaxy , the dynamical center is assumed to lie at ra(2000)=12@xmath7628@xmath7714.7@xmath78 and dec(2000)=44@xmath7905@xmath8030@xmath81 ( which coincides with the photometric center ) .",
    "contrary to what has been found for the  where there is an offset between the optical center and the hi dynamical center @xcite  in , both optical and hi centres spatially coincide @xcite .",
    "we adopt @xmath82 km sec@xmath3 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . comparing the computed values with those in other papers ,",
    "our @xmath71 is in agreement with the value determined by @xcite .    regarding the @xmath85 , our choice for this value disagrees with the value given in the rc3 catalog @xcite ; we recall that rc3 values are determined from optical population i morphologies . in a recent work @xcite",
    ", it is noted that the @xmath85 ( in the population i component ) rotates e from n as the radius increases , indicative of the presence of a stellar bar potential .",
    "thus , the disagreement of our @xmath85 with that in rc3 might conceivably be due to the fact that in this study we are exclusively dealing with the ionized gas component .",
    "finally , our inclination ( @xmath73 ) agrees extremely well with @xcite .",
    "the resulting rotation curve is shown in figure [ rot_cur ] . from this figure",
    "we can see that the gas in this galaxy rotates slowly around the bar perturbation with a maximum velocity value of @xmath25 40 km s@xmath3 at a radius of 2 kpc in the ne ; on the contrary , the rotation curve displays substantial velocity gradients at the sw zone .",
    "it should be noted that the ne side of the galaxy ( the receding side ) shows a smooth behavior which can be fitted by solid body rotation .",
    "in contrast , the approaching side is less populated with regions and the results are quite chaotic on local scales .",
    "given the likely scenario of having undergone an interaction in the past @xcite , the highly perturbed radial velocity field in approaching side may bear some former signature of the interaction with @xcite .",
    "when we compare our results with the rotation curve calculated by @xcite , the agreement is good to within 30% of the measured values ( she reports 30 km s@xmath3 at 2 kpc ) . from optical studies ,",
    "@xcite report a _ line",
    " of  sight _ rotation velocity of 15 km s@xmath3 in the bar . in this case , our velocity map in figure 9 displays a _ line  of  sight _ rotation velocity of around @xmath25 20 km s@xmath3 .",
    "taking into account our uncertainties see @xcite  the agreement is good .    using our derived optical rotation curve , we calculate the mass inside the limiting radius reached by our observations . taking the receding side in our rotation curve ,",
    "the mass inside the optical radius of about 2 kpc , is 7.2 @xmath10 10@xmath86 m@xmath87 .",
    "this result is in agreement with the optical mass derived in a previous work @xcite . using our derived mass value , we determine the central density in",
    "; we derive a value @xmath88= 0.021 m@xmath87 pc@xmath23 .",
    "this value is in excellent agreement with the average value @xmath89 = 0.02 m@xmath87 pc@xmath23 , recently found for galactic halo central densities @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the central halo densities are almost independent of galactic mass whether dealing on galactic or galaxy cluster scales in frameworks of cold dark matter cosmologies .    in summary , we quantitatively find that the ionized gas in is rotating weakly , as has been suggested previously @xcite . however , solid body rotation is only applicable for the ne sector of the disk .",
    "the sw side demonstrates abrupt radial velocity gradients , with differences greater than 100 km s@xmath3 for regions practically in contact ( at least in projection ) .",
    "due to substantial uncertainties in many of our data points at those sw locations , we did not deem it fit to determine the nature of the sw side rotation pattern in any further detail than explored here .",
    "has been recently studied in the content by @xcite .",
    "the spatial and velocity resolution in that analysis was @xmath90 and 10 km s@xmath3 , respectively . in our discussion here , we focus on the component which spatially corresponds with our optical observations ( figures 14 and 16 in hunter et al .",
    "1999 ) .    in the optical body of the galaxy",
    ", the velocity field follows the behavior which we determined for the ionized gas ( compare our figure  [ vr_maps ] with figure 14 in hunter et al .",
    "1999 ) . in the ne side of the optical body ,",
    "the velocity field presents values of the order of 240 km s@xmath3 , while it decreases in the sw sector , to values of order 190 km s@xmath3 .",
    "as one approaches the outermost detected peripheries in the distribution ( inside the inner 13@xmath444 ) , the velocity field is rather complex .",
    "farther to the sw , the velocity field increases in value ( up to 350400 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "this also includes the locale of the `` arc '' ( west of the photometric center ) already described in section 3 .",
    "on the other hand , going farther to the ne , the velocity field decreases to values of 150190 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the outer counterrotates relative to the inner .",
    "the complex behavior shown by the velocity field is probably a result of the interaction between and @xcite .",
    "the velocity dispersions inside the limits of the optical disk are of the order of 1535 km s@xmath3 . along the optical bar ,",
    "the highest values ( 2527 km s@xmath3 ) correspond to three locales , as also found in this work and by @xcite .",
    "going to the ne end of the bar , the velocity dispersions experience an increment in their values , reaching 35 km s@xmath3 around the location where we report a ring  like feature ( section 4.1.1 ) , encircled by regions v25 , v31 , v34 , and v48 . for the remainder of the northern sector of the disk , the velocity dispersions lie in the range of 12.520 km s@xmath3 . in the optical disk ,",
    "the velocity dispersion field shows the same behavior we calculated with our fp data .",
    "the main difference is that the ionized gas presents higher velocity dispersions  of order 2 times those in ( compare our figure  [ vr_maps ] with figure 16 in hunter et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "this galaxy clearly does not present a classical picture of a symmetric global velocity field in ; most likely again due to the interloper @xcite .",
    "the column density distribution also betrays hints of a past interaction .",
    "the peak of the column density is located far away from the optical center , at a distance of approximately @xmath91 , which corresponds to 900 pc .",
    "also , as noted by @xcite , there is little detailed correlation between the column density of the gas and the presence of regions .",
    "we have successfully performed a detailed kinematical and dynamical analysis of the entire ionized gas content in the nearby irregular galaxy , by means of fabry  perot interferometry .",
    "the analysis has been accomplished separately on both global as well as local scales and several of our conclusions are new .    on local scales",
    ", we focused our attention on the region population , extracting radial velocities and velocity dispersions . in this way , we present , for the first time",
    ", the most extensive kinematical catalog of the regions in this galaxy yet published .",
    "we find that the region population shows similar integrated properties when compared to kinematical data previously obtained in the relatively isolated irregular @xcite .",
    "the latter statement also applies to the velocity dispersions in the star forming regions : in both galaxies , they are approximately identical . moreover , in many cases we did detected velocity profiles indicative of a complex structure not fitted by _",

    "these profiles are undoubtedly related to the high perturbed radial velocity field , which shows traces of a plethora of superbubbles , filaments and a very active ( and widespread ) diffuse ionized gas spanning the entire optical disk .",
    "statistically , using the region diameter distribution and the region luminosity function , we find that the star forming complexes are typical of those obtained for larger samples of irregulars .",
    "we furthermore analysed the kinematical properties of the diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) on global scales by means of radial velocity and velocity dispersion fields ; locally , we explored the kinematics , making use of profile decomposition .",
    "as far as we are aware , this is the first time that such an analysis has been performed in this object .",
    "our results point towards a highly chaotic medium , especially at those locations close to the brightest complexes in the bar .",
    "we postulate that the chaotic radial velocity field induces local compression ensuring the propagation of stochastic star formation as also discussed by @xcite .    on global scales ,",
    "we find a relatively well behaved radial velocity field , showing a decreasing gradient in radial velocity along the optical bar from ne to sw , suggesting solid body rotation .",
    "this result agrees well with previous kinematical results ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we believe that presents solid body rotation ( albeit at low rotation velocities ) north of the optical center .",
    "reliable fits are not possible in the southern sector of the disk , due to the chaotic motions at those locales .",
    "the inner kinematics ( inner 13@xmath294 ) also shows a good correspondence with the optical radial velocities we find in this study .",

    "<S> a detailed kinematic analysis of ionized gas in the nearby irregular galaxy is presented . </S>",
    "<S> observations are conducted in the spectral lines of h@xmath0 and [ ] . </S>",
    "<S> our scanning fabry  perot interferometric observations are presented from both a global as well as a local perspective . </S>",
    "<S> we have analysed the global velocity field , the spatially extended diffuse gaseous component ( dig ) , the region populations , and , furthermore , have determined the rotation curve based on the heliocentric radial velocities of the global h@xmath0 spatial distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> our results for show that the optical velocity field has a decreasing value in radial velocity along the optical bar from ne to sw , presenting an anticorrelation relative to the outer velocity field of the component . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> the dig component that permeates the entire galaxy was analysed ( up to a limiting surface brightness of @xmath1 ergs @xmath2 s@xmath3 steradian@xmath3 ) in terms of its radial velocity field as well as its velocity dispersions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the diffuse gas component presents peculiar kinematical features such as abrupt velocity gradients and highly supersonic velocity dispersions ( @xmath4 4 times the values of the nearest regions ) but that its kinematical and dynamical influence is important on both global and local scales . </S>",
    "<S> the optical rotation curve of this nearby irregular shows that the ne sector rotates like a solid body ( @xmath540 km s@xmath3 at @xmath62 kpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for the sw side , our results are not conclusive ; the behavior of the gas at those locations is chaotic . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the origin of such complex kinematics and dynamics is undoubtedly related to the aftermath of an interaction experienced by this galaxy in the past . </S>"
