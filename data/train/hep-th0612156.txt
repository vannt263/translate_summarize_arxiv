    "in classical mechanics one can define entropy by specifying macro states , @xmath1 , as boltzmann s constant times the logarithm of the phase space volume of the space of micro states corresponding to such a macro state : @xmath2 here @xmath3 phase space , ( ps for short ) , is the set of all the micro states @xmath4 that agree with the macro state @xmath1 ; @xmath5    we suppose that we can distinguish various `` macro states '' in the sense that collections ( subset , roughly speaking ) of states of the system at the fundamental level correspond to what we collect under one state in macroscopic thermodynamics .",
    "if we can assign these macro states entropies , we can define them as logarithms of the number of states in the macro state , according to usual definition @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "this `` number of states '' in the macro state may be able to be defined in quantum mechanics , but in a classical description we either have to replace the number of states by a volume of the corresponding phase space or we have to discretize the phase space .",
    "when the system is described macroscopically and behaves adiabatically , we shall seek to define a kind of currents very generally as below .",
    "the point @xmath4 is phase - space point = micro state .",
    "usually one specifies a reversible development of the macro state by taking it to be very slow .",
    "this means that one can invert the rate of development of the macro state in time .",
    "if there is no such fact , it may cause significant influence on the micro physics and micro development to the second order in the development rate of the macro state @xmath6 .",
    "combining this approximation with the second order effect of @xmath7 in the second law of thermodynamics @xmath8 , requires @xmath9 which is nothing but conservation of @xmath10 , if we use a simple formal taylor expansion @xmath11 here we neglect all but first term in the slow limit .",
    "part of the motivation of the present article is the hope to make more general definition of reversibility criteria .    a direction in which such generalization has already been done in many articles and textbooks .",
    "we also go and seek to construct entropy distribution in space and entropy current , so to speak answer where the entropy is .",
    "we would contemplate to specify in which field variables would sit the entropy in a latticized field theory .",
    "in such a latticized field theory one has collections of variables and equations of motion .",
    "one could hope to obtain a general description as to how the entropy flows under certain restrictions of macro state .    in the long run one might seek to study entropy flow in a euclidean field theory ( latticized or not ) . in studying this",
    "it is most elegant and easy to work in the case of reversible processes because the entropy gets conserved . in such processes",
    "@xmath12 holds so that the second law of thermodynamics is fulfilled in a trivial manner and furthermore time reversal invariance too .",
    "therefore this second law is not very relevant if we restrict ourself to reversible processes as is actually the case in the present article .",
    "this touches on a motivation of ours for present work : we study entropy flow without necessarily assuming second law at the outset .",
    "this paper is the first attempt in a series of papers on this entropy flow subject .",
    "we then expect that the entropy will be conserved .",
    "in fact in cases where we have latticized field theories we would expect that we could find a conserved current @xmath13 of entropy @xmath14    it is the main purpose in the present article to discuss and construct such an entropy current under an abstract and general set up .",
    "however we investigate in detail only in a couple of examples the most important of which is a certain triangular lattice in two space time dimensions .",
    "we shall meet in this article a few surprising results in connection with defining such entropy currents for the latticized field theory models : it turns out that in two dimensional space time we actually have to define different entropy currents @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 rather than just one as one might have a priori expected .",
    "when one talks about entropy it is normal to think about the second law of thermodynamics tells that entropy @xcite will always increase or stay constant , but never fall down .",
    "if we , however , as in this article , restrict ourselves to the adiabatic process the entropy gets constant and the second law is not so relevant anymore .",
    "in fact it is realized trivially .",
    "we would rather like in the present work to think of it under the condition that we have imposed an abstractly defined adiabaticity @xcite condition .",
    "once this is assumed to be valid for our model we will be able to find the conserved entropy current without having to make any use of the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "we therefore would like to think of our calculations as performed in a world without having any second law of thermodynamics at all .",
    "in other words we should rather think of the present article as a work relevant for working prior to the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "thus we should be able to make use of our considerations in an attempt to derive the second law from physics assumed at a more fundamental level .",
    "we must though admit that in the present article we assume adiabaticity : it is defined though in a so abstract manner that we do not need second law for that either .",
    "thus our considerations could be especially relevant for models with compact space time for which non - trivial relevance of second law of thermodynamics may not be possible .",
    "since we only consider trivial realization of the second law of thermodynamics , @xmath18 , the time orientation associated with this second law becomes quite relevant .",
    "thus we also do not really use the metric tensor for space time and through most of the present article it is not specified whether we use minkowskian or euclidean metric .",
    "however the lattice which we use in the example is a two dimensional triangular one and it has a @xmath19 degree rotation symmetry .",
    "this symmetry suggests a euclidean metric since it is a subgroup of the euclidean rotation .",
    "the lack of specification of a time axis orientation immediately calls attention to the fact that it needs a convention of sign in order to define an entropy density @xmath20 which is part of an entropy current @xmath13 .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : all through the article we shall make use of the concept of macro states or rather macro restriction in the sense of a subset of all the micro states .",
    "there are fundamental field configurations , corresponding to a class of such states conceived as not distinguished in the macroscopic description .    in section 2",
    "we introduce our two dimensional classical lattice field theory . in section 3",
    "we describe the restriction on the field @xmath21 . in section 4",
    "argue a reversability ( or adiabaticity ) requirement as a local principle of no loss of micro solutions by local interplay . in section 5",
    "we give a one dimensional example that illustrates our formalism . in section 6",
    "we then go to our main example , the two dimensional latticized theory . in section 7",
    "we then define entropy currents @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 associated with each  class of half curves on the lattice \" . in section 8",
    "we connect these quantities with our entropy flow currents by some equations . in section 9",
    "we emphasize that we obtained three entropy currents .",
    "in section 10 we point out two alternative way of constructing our three entropy currents . in section 11",
    "we then actually construct one of them , @xmath22 using conservation law in our formalism . in section 12 the continuum limit is considered for this current @xmath22 . in section 13 the formalism",
    "is described analogously for the rest two currents @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in section 14 a relation between the three entropy currents",
    "is presented . in section 15",
    "we seek to understand three entropy currents by relating them to numbers of solution .",
    "section 16 is devoted to present conclusion and outlook .",
    "we want to study reversibility hypothesis tells us for a field theory with space so that we can study how entropy may flow",
    ".    for simplicity we shall exercise by a two dimensional space - time world and even discretize it into a lattice .",
    "we may at first set up the lattice theory quite naively by assuming that we have it as a system of first order differential equations in which the derivatives are discretized and made into differences .",
    "we may think of the discretized derivatives to be one - sided ; for instance we may choose the forward difference equation to the discretized differential one @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a lattice constant that can be set to one and @xmath27 a function .",
    "we shall end by having the differential equations turned into an equation set , one per site .",
    "this equation will involve the fields on three different sites , namely    1 .   on the selected site 2 .",
    "on the site following the above first one in the x - direction 3 .",
    "on the site following the second one in the y - direction .",
    "it is the latter two sites that are needed to make the discretized derivatives . in d - dimensional space there will be analogously a need for involving at least @xmath28 lattice sites in the equations .",
    "it is important for having the number of equations correctly that we have just one such @xmath28 ( =3 in @xmath29 case ) equations for each site .",
    "we may draw symbolically as fig .",
    "1 the involvement of the sites in the equations by encircling the sites involved in an equation . then the just described set up comes to look as fig . 1 .",
    "there is indeed the same number of sites s representing fields per unit area as the number of equations of motion as depicted in fig .",
    "1 . the encircling lines represent the field equations .",
    "so if we had a compact two dimensional space - a torus say - covered by this pattern there would be equally many variables as equations .",
    "the - symbols represent equally many equations as the field components .",
    "thus we expect generically that we get an equation system with just a discrete set of solutions . at first you might expect this equation system to have just of order of unity solutions .",
    "as we already know there is much more than of order of unity solutions for systems behaving chaotical behavior",
    ".    we might draw more elegantly the lattice by deforming it so as to draw as fig . 2 in a hexagonally symmetric way :",
    "suppose we have a lattice of points with some fields defined on each of these points",
    ". we may be so abstract that there may not even be the same number of components and type of fields at each lattice point , but such an extension will not play important role in this section",
    ". we can give a name to the set of field configurations f. then a field development through all times of the whole system is described at the micro level by a function @xmath21 defined on the lattice l and taking values in f. that is to say @xmath30 if we want to be very general and let @xmath21 take values that are specific for the various sites @xmath31 we can just formally put the value set @xmath32 allowed for @xmath33 into @xmath34 as subset and write @xmath35 with restrictions @xmath36 .",
    "we then introduce the concept of a `` macro restriction '' .",
    "the idea is that it generalizes the restriction that some part of the world at some time in some era is in a special macro state in the thermodynamical sense .",
    "the macro restriction is meant to be the restriction on the micro degrees of freedom , i.e. the field @xmath21 at the lattice points which ensures this micro configuration to be conceived as the macro state .",
    "it is taken to define the  macro restriction \" in question . by generalizing this concept of macro ( state ) restriction",
    ", we would like to introduce a more broad concept of restriction between field values on the lattice points .",
    "especially it should be possible to have such restrictions between field configurations in successive time moments and thus we could consider the equations of motion as a special case of a restriction .",
    "the macro restriction is now defined to be a constraint on the function @xmath21 on a subset , @xmath37 say , of the lattice @xmath38 .",
    "that is to say the `` macro restriction '' is defined by specifying a subset of functions @xmath39 we shall be mainly interested in `` local macro restrictions '' by which we mean that the lattice points of @xmath37 lies in the neighborhood of each other",
    ".    then we think about a possible macro description as a set of macro restrictions @xmath40 where i denotes the set of all positive integers .",
    "thus we require about an `` allowed '' map @xmath41 that it should obey @xmath42 .",
    "\\label{3.4}\\ ] ] the easiest to think about is really to think of the @xmath32 s ( or @xmath34 ) as discrete countable or even finite sets , so that we simply can count the number of functions of the type @xmath43 corresponding to a given `` macro description '' @xmath44 .",
    "we have to keep in mind that such a macro description is a description from a macroscopic point of view of the time development of some classical field theory .",
    "the lattice @xmath38 is a space time lattice so that each lattice point represents both a space point and a moment of time .",
    "the latticized equation of motion would mean - typically for a first order differential equation - a relation between @xmath28 neighboring lattice point fields . here",
    "@xmath45 is the number of space time dimensions",
    ". such restrictions @xmath21 of equation of motion to a subset of @xmath28 neighboring points @xmath46 are formally of a completely similar form as the macro restrictions ( [ 3.4 ] ) the function subsets @xmath47 connected with the equations of motion are of a special type .",
    "in fact in the simplest case @xmath48 for these equations of motion restriction . here cardinal number @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 the number of elements in @xmath37 .",
    "that is to say we can consider the equation of motion as a lot of macro restrictions with the @xmath51 involving @xmath28 lattice point i.e. @xmath52 , where @xmath53 means cardial number of the set .",
    "the set @xmath47 for the equations of motion which represent macro restrictions are then subsets of dimension @xmath54 of the full @xmath55 dimensional space on the space of all functions defined on the subset @xmath46 of the lattice . here",
    "we denoted by @xmath56 the dimension of @xmath32 s - assumed to be the same for all @xmath57 - so that the @xmath56 equations of motion just bring the dimension of the space of functions @xmath58 restriction to @xmath59 down from @xmath55 to @xmath60 .",
    "in this section we want to formulate the requirement of only reversible ( or adiabatic ) processes .",
    "we have recently pointed out @xcite that if one imposes a specific periodicity on a mechanical system , then the system is generically forced to behave reversibly .",
    "thus we could use such a special model with imposed periodicity that the model has compact space time as a simple example of a model in which reversibility is imposed . but let us stress that this is just an example and that we in general we assume that we work with reversible processes only .    as the simplest case we want to consider a compactified space time so that there is no such thing as @xmath61 or the space",
    "coordinate running off to infinity .",
    "since in this case we expect very few solutions if any , it may sound a little strange to make statistical considerations concerning these solutions .",
    "let us , however , at first think in this statistical way and imagine that for a given system of macro state restrictions one can ask for a probability for solutions there .",
    "for many combinations of macro restrictions we really risk that that probability for at least one solution would be extremely low .",
    "one might assign even meaning to low probability for getting a solution because it would occur with a tiny probability measure in the parameter space .    in our article",
    "we actually introduced a way of working with generic equations of motion by taking parameters in the hamiltonian as random numbers , so that one could in principle ask for probabilities of getting various numbers of solutions .",
    "naturally we should consider the case that the higher the number of allowed functions @xmath21 (  solutions \" ) the more likely is a certain system of macro restrictions , what we called a macro description .",
    "so we should be most interested in macro scenarios with the largest number of allowed functions @xmath35 .",
    "we can say in this way when we have taken @xmath34 or @xmath32 s discretized form so as to be able to simply count functions @xmath21 .",
    "however , we may treat quite analogously the cases in which we think of @xmath34 as a space with continuous coordinates on it , provided it is possible at the end to define a measure on the set of solutions @xmath21 that obey the equation of restrictions .",
    "then such measure may replace the counting in the totally discrete case .    typically @xmath34 would be phase space with a liouville measure on it , but for pedagogical reasons we shall at first consider the discretized case in which we can simply count the number of functions @xmath21 . if we had not made the space on which the lattice @xmath38 is distributed a compact one the lattice @xmath38 might be infinite and we may for that reason also get problems with pure counting .",
    "since we shall , however , be most interested in small local regions we shall be satisfied with counting ; we first of all look for pieces of the lattice @xmath38 with only a finite number of sites .",
    "we should impose the following principle on the system of restrictions : whenever the sets of lattice points @xmath37 and @xmath62 involved in two restrictions @xmath63 and @xmath64 have a non - trivial overlap @xmath65 , then the restrictions here will be consistent in the sense that the imposition of one of the restrictions must not reduce the number of field configurations allowed on the overlap @xmath65 .",
    "we may have to keep in mind that if we have in certain macro scenario two macro restrictions defined on the subsets @xmath1 and @xmath37 of the lattice with @xmath66 then we can replace those macro restrictions by a single one `` @xmath67''on the bigger subsets of the ones of @xmath38 , namely @xmath37 .",
    "that is to say we can choose a new restriction defined on @xmath37 : @xmath68 we can thus reduce our considerations to macro scenarios built up from a set @xmath69 where non of the @xmath46 s are contained in any other one .",
    "if two such restrictions , say @xmath70 and @xmath71 have a non - empty intersection of their lattice sets @xmath72 , then we can ask for whether the restriction of @xmath21 to the overlap region @xmath73 is allowed to be the same set of restricted functions for @xmath70 as for @xmath71 .",
    "if the @xmath74 functions allowed by @xmath70 and @xmath71 are not essentially the same then the functions over @xmath37 belonging to the set @xmath75 which are also allowed by @xmath70 will be reduced in number relative to the number of functions in @xmath75 .    under the statistical way of which we would like to justify by some physical considerations above in section 3 , there is only a fraction of the set of functions @xmath75 that can be realized .",
    "that will at the end reduce the number of allowed @xmath21 by the ratio giving the fraction of @xmath75 which get allowed by @xmath70 . by having such a lack of match on the overlap region @xmath65",
    "we have basically lost a fraction of the potentially achievable allowed functions @xmath21 .",
    "so keep to the maximal number of allowed @xmath21 functions , at least not reduce the number unnecessarily locally , we should require that the restrictions of @xmath21 to @xmath65 for any pair of macro restrictions @xmath76 be the same set of functions on @xmath65 from both @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "therefore we must require @xmath77    we can say that this requirement ensures that the macro restriction @xmath71 does not - alone at least - require any drastic selection of the possible solutions of @xmath21 to @xmath62 which are to be in @xmath78 . if this condition ( [ 4.2 ] ) is not satisfied then e.g. most elements ( ordered sets ) in the set of @xmath78 restricted to @xmath65 are not extendable into functions over @xmath37 that belong to the set of functions @xmath75 .",
    "but that means that the ones which be extended into @xmath75 functions are only a tiny subset of all the functions in @xmath78 , so that if an @xmath75 function is realized it would seem miraculous .",
    "we would like to put in a remark about the very low accuracy with which we really intend to work here : since our main goal is to obtain results about entropy flowing and conservation and entropy in an in most situations to be considered tiny boltzmann s constant @xmath79 as unit .",
    "we will be satisfied with an accuracy in the number of @xmath21 function ( by solving the restrictions ) .",
    "it is so low that deviations by a few orders of magnitude is considered quite negligible difference .    in the same spirit",
    "we also take it that two different sets of @xmath21 functions have typically numbers of elements which deviate by several orders of magnitude .",
    "thus one will generically dominate the other one .",
    "in fact entropy is @xmath79 times the logarithm of the number of micro states in a macro state and thus we do not need a high accuracy .",
    "so if the number of elements in the two sets do not differ by a big factor it will not be so significant .",
    "therefore suppose that there is indeed a significant lack of matching of the two sets of functions on @xmath65 differ in number by such a big factor .",
    "then if you find a @xmath80 which matches @xmath63 by having its restriction to @xmath81 extendable into an @xmath75 function then it would seem very unlikely .",
    "it should be recognized that our assumption ( [ 4.2 ] ) actually imply that we have only reversible processes and that the second law of thermodynamics is also fulfilled in the trivial manner @xmath18 .",
    "in fact we could imagine that we attempted to have a system of macro states and macro states such that entropy increased ( i.e. irreversible process ) . in this case we know that at later times @xmath82 than the era of the irreversible process the possible micro developments  in our notation @xmath21 is a field in space time  could not be constructed .",
    "it represents all the configurations allowed by the high entropy macro states at such a later time @xmath82 . in other words",
    "there would be many states in the high entropy macro state at late time , but they could not be realized via equations of motion from a micro state in a previous low entropy macro state .",
    "we may now argue that somewhere in between the two times ,  low \" and  high \" entropies as discussed above , there must be some moment and somewhere , where we have some overlap between two sets of lattice points associated with equations of motion restrictions in which ( [ 4.2 ] ) is violated .",
    "we must have some moment of time from which we start to get those macro restrictions .",
    "there all the allowed micro states can not be realized , because of the relation by equation of motion to a moment shortly before .",
    "if we denote by @xmath63 the earliest macro state restriction while the offensive restriction by @xmath64 , we might reach a situation illustrated in figure 3 .        in order that the equation of motion restriction symbolized by @xmath64 or rather fig .",
    "3 will disturb all micro state possibilities in @xmath63 , there must be a non - empty overlap @xmath83 . since we actually selected the @xmath63 and @xmath64 such that the imposition of @xmath21 obeying @xmath78 should diminish the development @xmath21 that is allowed for the macro restriction @xmath63 we will not fulfill ( [ 4.2 ] ) .",
    "rather we should have @xmath84 thus we see that , if we assume validity of ( [ 4.2 ] ) in all the cases of overlapping restrictions which are either macro  or equation of motion ones , then there is no place for irreversible processes .    by making the similar argument time reversed way we can also find that our assumption ( [ 4.2 ] ) also means that the entropy can not decrease because that would imply that at some earlier than the entropy decreasing era the micro states allowed by the macro restriction could not be realized due to equations of motion .",
    "this completes the argument that our assumption ( [ 4.2 ] ) leads to be satisfied trivially second law so that no irreversible processes occur .",
    "to illustrate our formalism we may use it to a simple case , one dimensional lattice of time moments and a general mechanical system developing through a series of macro states @xmath85 with entropies @xmath86 , at a site @xmath61 .    at first this models",
    "has the following two types of macro restrictions : + 1 ) the ones specifying just the restriction of @xmath21 to a single discrete site @xmath61 by @xmath87 2 ) the ones restricting the restriction of @xmath21 to two neighboring sites on @xmath61-axis i.e. to @xmath88 say .",
    "these are the macro restrictions implementing the equations of motion and have the form @xmath89 which is nothing but the discretized hamilton equations . here @xmath90 is the antisymmetric matrix which takes the form @xmath91 with an appropriate ordering of the components of @xmath92 conceived of as generalized coordinates and their conjugate momenta .",
    "we argued above that one should not consider macro restrictions for subsets of lattice subsets used for other macro restrictions .",
    "rather one should combine them into macro restrictions for the biggest of the subsets so as to end up with subsets either fully disjoint or only partly overlapping .",
    "in the example here it means that we shall so to speak absorb the macro restrictions for @xmath93 and @xmath94 into that for @xmath95 . in this way",
    "we get replacement macro restrictions for the subsets of the lattice of the form @xmath95 .",
    "in fact we get the following simple expression , @xmath96    we either work with undiscretized phase space for @xmath34 or we discretize into points with a given density so that each point gets a cell of volume @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the number of degrees of freedom , @xmath99 .",
    "it is a density proportional to phase space density . in any case",
    "we can use that the time development under the hamilton equations is a canonical transformation and as such conserves the phase space volume .",
    "this means that the original relation @xmath100 from ( [ 5.2 ] ) allows just one value at @xmath61 for each value at @xmath101 and oppositely . if the two entropies @xmath86 and @xmath102 happen to be equally big it is at least possible that the replacing macro restriction ( [ 5.4 ] ) simply allows realization of any point in @xmath85 as well as any point in @xmath103 .",
    "however if these two entropies are not equal it will be the smaller one of the two entropies @xmath86 and @xmath102 that determines the size of the set @xmath104 of restrictions of @xmath21 to @xmath95 allowed by the combined macro restriction eq.([5.4 ] ) .",
    "in fact @xmath105 if we go to consider if two neighboring ones out of these replacing macro restrictions @xmath100 and @xmath106 we ask whether the restrictions to the overlap region @xmath107 can match . for such a matching it would at least be needed that the cardinal number @xmath49 for the two different sets of functions would be the same : @xmath108 but now we quickly see that these numbers are @xmath109 and @xmath110 respectively .",
    "the condition for any chance of matching is therefore needed that @xmath111    we can also say that the only entropy numbers relevant for the replacement @xmath104 s , namely @xmath112 have to be the same i.e. @xmath113 .",
    "that is to say for all the information about the entropies of the @xmath85 s it has left any footprint into the @xmath114 and actually thereby to the physics of the model these entropies @xmath86 must be constant down along the chain of time .",
    "we could simply use the taylor expansion of a smooth @xmath86 as function of @xmath61 and insert it into our condition eq.([5.7 ] ) and we would deduce @xmath115 in other words , our matching condition `` to have no miracles locally '' ( in either way of time direction thinking ) leads to the constancy of entropy in the one dimensional example which we just presented .",
    "using the same procedure in our two dimensional lattice example we take it that the biggest subsets of the lattice for which we have macro restrictions are the three element ones associated with the equation of motion .",
    "basically we should then absorb the other macro restrictions into these three point ones , which should then replace all the others .",
    "after this replacement - a kind of absorption - there will be no longer any tracks left of macro restrictions associated with subsets @xmath37 of the lattice contained in the surviving three - point subsets .",
    "suppose e.g. that the macro states imposed on the three sites in a subset @xmath62 of the lattice associated with the equation of motion are called @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 .",
    "that is to say we have in the lattice depicted in fig . 4 :     +    here @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the names of the sites .",
    "whatever these macro restrictions to the macro states @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 originally would have been the information surviving into the replacement @xmath122 macro restriction from these macro states would only be some macro states which could then be called @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "they will be defined from the @xmath122 as @xmath126 defined from another set of three points @xmath127 say which also contains say @xmath119 we get analogously @xmath128 the condition to avoid locally miraculous restrictions - our principle - now comes to say e.g. @xmath129 for a situation like :     +    this relation implies @xmath130 for the entropies .    in the spirit of only the information surviving into the @xmath131 , @xmath122 , etc accessible",
    "after all at all we could also redefine correlation of entropies between neighboring points - whenever present in one of our three - point @xmath37-sets - by putting say @xmath132",
    "we have found above a sort of conservation rules associated with parallelogram - like figures .",
    "we should have in mind that there are in our lattice such types of parallelogram - like structure orientations .",
    "it is therefore natural that we shall construct three different entropy currents , which we may in the continuum limit denote @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 corresponding to the three different orientations of parallelograms to be associated with the conservation .    before writing down complete form of the continuum limit currents @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 by means of the lattice quantities as it is our goal to do soon",
    ", we should look a bit more on how it comes that we have these three different concepts of entropy flow .    for this purpose",
    "we want to point out corresponding to one of the orientations of our parallelogram - like structures there is a restricted class of curves on the lattice .",
    "such a class of curves is by definition a curve of the type allowed for either the full drawn or the broken lines forming what we could call the two sides of the `` parallelogram - structures '' as is depicted in fig .",
    "6 . these curves may be described by thinking of them as oriented meaning with an arrow along them and then they are allowed to be composed from only two types of links .",
    "for instance we define corresponding to a parallelogram - like structure of the orientation        have that in the `` positive '' direction along the curves allowed in the class which we call here class @xmath1 , there are only links corresponding to space time vectors ( @xmath136,@xmath137 ) and ( @xmath136,-@xmath137 ) . here",
    "@xmath26 is the hexagonal lattice constant , i.e. the length of the sides of the triangles .",
    "starting from a lattice site @xmath138 say we can by composing these two vectors in succession construct an infinite number of half - curves extending from this point @xmath138 as in figure 7 :        we will call such a family of half - curves extending from @xmath138 the @xmath1-class of half curves extending from @xmath138 .",
    "it will be later of interest that with the equations of motion associated to every other of the triangles in the lattice as already described , we can use these equations of motion to predict the restriction of a solution to the equations of motion to one of the half - curves in class @xmath1 extending from @xmath138 say @xmath139 to the restriction of an other half curve in the same class @xmath1 also extending from @xmath138 , say @xmath140 .",
    "in fact one may easily convince oneself by looking at figure 8 that supposing a solution on the half curve @xmath141 - here @xmath141 is written with the line - is given , then the values of that solution on the @xmath142 - half - curve can be calculated without further input information .",
    "in fact one shall just use the rule that when at two points in a black triangle  the solution values are known then the value on the third corner of this triangle is uniquely given by equation of motion .",
    "basically the uniqueness is argued for it relatively from curve @xmath141 to curve @xmath142 . from this unique predictability from one half - curve @xmath141 to another one @xmath142 in the class we may think of a speculation of @xmath21 along any curve in class @xmath1 from @xmath138 to tell the same information about @xmath21 .",
    "that is to say that by choosing say the class @xmath1 one has specified in detail what could be called the `` information '' about a solution @xmath21 to the equations lying to the @xmath1-side of a space - time point @xmath138 .",
    "we will say that the information about solutions @xmath21 contained to the @xmath1-side of @xmath138 is the information contained in the restriction of @xmath21 to one of the half - curves , @xmath142 say , extending from @xmath138 and belonging to class @xmath1 , which again means composed successively from ( @xmath137 , @xmath136 ) and ( @xmath143 , @xmath136 ) .",
    "as stressed it does not matter which of these half - curves we use , they all give the same information about solutions .",
    "this question of information about solutions really gets precise by talking about that solutions @xmath21 can be classified into classes inside which the solutions have the same restriction to all the half - curves of @xmath1-type extending from @xmath138 .",
    "but again we have to have in mind it is enough to require two solutions @xmath144 and @xmath145 to have the same restriction @xmath146 to one half - curve in the class of curves then it will be true for all the half - curves of type @xmath1 extending from @xmath138 .",
    "if you therefore want to count the number of allowed solutions corresponding to a macro scenario and to define how the information needed to specify a solution lies to one side or to the other side of the space time point @xmath138 , we may make the concept of these `` sides '' meaningful by saying that the information on the @xmath1-side is the one contained in the restriction of @xmath21 to one of the half - curves , @xmath141 , i.e. the information contained in @xmath147 .    ignoring the problems of infrared divergences",
    "we could say that , if we consider the set of all solutions @xmath148 of a given macro scenario and ask for how many different restrictions @xmath21@xmath149 to a half - curve @xmath141 in the @xmath1-class extending from @xmath138 , the logarithm of this number represents the entropy to the @xmath1-side of @xmath138 .",
    "the counting just by numbers is only possible if we have discretized the value space for solutions @xmath21 so that they become countable , but then one could instead imagine using a method of the type of measuring phase space volume . even if infrared divergence problems makes it ill - defined what the full amount of entropy to the @xmath1-side of @xmath150 is , we can still get quite meaningful convergent results for the entropy on the @xmath1-side of @xmath150 subtracted from that to the @xmath1-side of another space time point @xmath151 , because we can now find @xmath1-type half courses extending from @xmath150 going to follow or coincide with an @xmath1-type half - curve extending from @xmath151 from some point on as depicted in fig .",
    "9 :        then we can use alone the restrictions of the solutions to the pieces of the half - curve which are not coinciding , and these pieces will be finite .",
    "it should be kept in mind that we want to identify the entropy on the @xmath1-side of @xmath150 with the number of solutions in the given macro scenario which is characterized by each class having its own restriction to the type a half - curves extending from @xmath150 .",
    "it should thus be understood that to the extend that we can identify this newly defined concept to the @xmath1-side of a space time point @xmath150 from a more usual concept of one side of a point in a one - space dimension world we may use such a concept to make a meaning where entropy is placed and thus entropy density and furthermore entropy flow .",
    "we want to compute what the conservation laws @xmath154@xmath22= @xmath154@xmath23= @xmath154@xmath24=0 for the three currents mean for the two scalar fields @xmath152 and @xmath153 in terms of which we managed to write them .",
    "since @xmath152 always come into the expressions for the currents via the difference @xmath155 we shall give this quantity the name @xmath156 @xmath157 let us also define for the three types half - curve systems @xmath1 , @xmath37 , and @xmath158 the unit vectors orthogonal to the average direction of these half - curves @xmath159 as well as the vectors in these average directions @xmath160 notice that you obtain @xmath161 by rotating @xmath162 by @xmath163 anticlockwise and analogously @xmath164 by rotating @xmath163 @xmath165 and so on .",
    "using this notation we can write expressions for the three entropy currents become @xmath166 since the topological current term @xmath167 is trivially conserved the nontrivial information from the conservation of the three currents comes only from the conservation of the first parts and that tells @xmath168    it is easy to see - as we essentially already did - that the sum of these three equations is trivially zero just from @xmath169@xmath170=@xmath170@xmath169 .",
    "so there is in reality only two independent equations , just enough to determine @xmath156 up to an additive constant .",
    "however , one may wonder whether there exists any @xmath156 function at all satisfying these equations .",
    "indeed the condition for that to be the case is that the partial derivatives of second order for @xmath156 derived from these equations are consistent with commutativity of the partial derivatives . for that we can consider the condition that @xmath171 the idea to obtain eq.([8.6 ] ) is to differentiate the first of the three equations in the @xmath164-direction , i.e. act on it with @xmath164@xmath154 , and then compare with what we get from the second equation by acting with @xmath161@xmath154 .",
    "it is easily seen the consistency condition for the two first equations manipulated this way becomes @xmath172 since indeed @xmath173 and we can symmetrize in the three indices @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 because @xmath177 is a symmetric third rank tensor we may write this condition @xmath178 we can consider the symmetric third rank tensor @xmath179 connected with our lattice and the selection of triangles to be associated with equations of motion .    it is easy to see that if indeed @xmath153 obey the third order homogeneous differential equation then we can from @xmath153 integrate up to an additive constant .",
    "now , however , it is crucial for our discussion that there is on our lattice three types of entropy currents under rotation by @xmath19 in the space - time plane choices of half - curve classes or equivalently parallelogram - like structure of orientations . we denote them by @xmath1 , @xmath37 , and @xmath158 and we have already discussed that the curves in class @xmath1 are made by successively compassing steps @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "analogously we let the @xmath37-type of half - curves be compared successively from steps @xmath182 and @xmath183 . and finally we have also a class of half - curves defined by the steps @xmath184 , and ( -@xmath185a,-@xmath186a ) .",
    "it should be seen that apart from the sign with which the links are allowed into the three defined types of half - curves which are thought of as the one oriented away from the starting point @xmath150 , there are only three directions of links in the lattice that can be used as steps for the curves .",
    "thus for example @xmath181 used in the @xmath1-type half - curves is re - used with opposite sign , @xmath183 as a step for type @xmath37 .",
    "let us also have in mind that there is one type of what we called parallelogram - like structures that can be called type @xmath37 , one that can be called type @xmath1 and so on .",

    "note that in both cases we have to select one of the types of curves @xmath1 , @xmath37 or @xmath158 .",
    "we must therefore a priori expect that can and must define three different entropy currents , each of which have to be marked by this choice @xmath1 , @xmath37 or @xmath158 .",

    "in fact @xmath254    having defined such an entropy on `` one side '' the current should be obtained simply as a topological charge out of this @xmath255 : @xmath256    thinking of @xmath257 as a site in our triangular lattice and noting that our link entropies @xmath203 ( entropy of link between g and h ) , if they are exponentiated , provide the number of variation possibilities for a solution restriction to a half - curve @xmath250 , say , which comes extra by having the link @xmath211 included .",
    "we can thus see that - even with respect to normalization - the entropy to the @xmath1-side of @xmath150 can be written as @xmath258 to avoid the infrared divergencies the easiest is to ask for the difference like @xmath259 now the links in the @xmath1-type half - curves go in the directions @xmath260 or @xmath261 and the links of these two directions are displaced by @xmath262 and @xmath263 respectively .",

    "if it were not integrable this way for the curves with an expansion ( [ gthrs63 ] ) having @xmath271{oup.eps}}}}}$ ] and @xmath271{odown.eps}}}}}$ ] both being positive it would mean that different curves of this type - but with common end points would not give rise to the same number of classes of different solution @xmath21 .",
    "since the classes of solutions defined from one of these curves are in a one - to - one correspondence with the ones from the other one there must be equally many and thus the one - form ( [ gthrs63 ] ) must be integrable .",
    "we can rewrite @xmath272    in this form the condition for @xmath273 being a total differential is very easy to write because the last term @xmath274 itself is one and can be ignored for that purpose .",
    "thus we simply get that @xmath275 or that @xmath276 only function of @xmath277 but not of @xmath217 .",
    "we recognize this expression ( [ 79 ] ) from the expression occurring in the form ( [ 49 ] ) or ( [ 59 ] ) for @xmath15 .",
    "we should remember though that in the derivation leading up to ( [ 49 ] ) or ( [ 59 ] ) we only used the conservation but did not have the normalization .",
    "rather we should use our expression for @xmath273 which has been physically normalized to define the correctly normalized @xmath15 current by @xmath278 so that we see @xmath279    one can similarly construct the analogous @xmath273 differential for the @xmath37- and the @xmath158-types of curves and see that the condition for them being integrable is just equivalent to the current conservation .",
    "again we could use this interpretation of the entropy by means of solution class counting to give the correct normalization of the current densities , @xmath280    from these considerations it should be understood that our @xmath1-type entropy current density @xmath281 , really tells the logarithm of how many classes of solutions belonging to the macro scenario are distinguishable by their restriction to one unit length in the @xmath217-direction .",
    "this is means infinitesimally that an @xmath282 is the classification number exp@xmath283 .",
    "this is indeed the number of states of the fields in the @xmath282-interval and thus our entropy current does indeed deserve to be called an entropy current .",
    "we have considered a `` classical '' lattice field theory on a two dimensional regular triangular lattice of a very general type . that is to say we did never write what the supposedly complicated equations would be .",
    "rather we just in a extremely abstract manner assumed that we looked for a big class of solutions obeying all over the lattice some macro constraints which were meant to be the features to what a macroscopic observer would notice .",
    "we assumed also in a general way that the macro scenario imposed corresponding to an adiabatic development formulated by the assumptions we called reversibility in either way .",
    "our assumption of reversibility or adiabaticity  either way \" was the assumption ( [ 4.2 ] ) in section 4 .",
    "it means that entropy would be constant .",
    "thus it becomes a setting for studying conserved entropy currents .",
    "it should be understood that such entropy flows are given in a macroscopic picture which means a system of macro restrictions , consistent with our reversibility .",
    "now our main study was for such macroscopic pictures or macro scenarios with our ( slightly generalized ) adiabaticity assumption to find and define conserved entropy currents because of the adiabaticity .",
    "the surprise is , however , that instead of finding only one - as one would presumably have expected - we found conserved entropy currents , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 as we denoted them in the continuum limit ( lattice constant @xmath284 ) .",
    "we can say that we found in our rather general latticized field theory different kinds of entropy !",
    "it turned out that with our special simplification of the lattice model having only restrictions by the field values that are related inside a certain system of triangles the three different currents of entropy could be described - in the continuum limit - in terms of two scalar fields @xmath152 and @xmath153 describing the prescribed macro scenario . from the conservation laws of these three entropies we got a certain homogeneous third order differential equation @xmath285 where the third order tensor @xmath286 is related to the lattice orientation .",
    "what we did by means of the lattice non rotational invariance was to let the lattice select some direction in which to say that the entropy flows .",
    "we have these different crude directions @xmath1 , @xmath37 , and @xmath158 `` half - curves '' .",
    "in minkowskian relativistic theories one must use the distinction between forward in time going and backward going ( half ) curves . to keep the precise analogy we should though rather think of right going and left going half - curves .",
    "but we managed under some more general condition to obtain even several entropy current definitions .",
    "we do probably best by admitting that we do not fully yet understand what is going on with these the somewhat mysterious entropies .",
    "it is rather obvious that as it comes out these entropies are seemingly lattice artifacts in as far as the bunches of `` half '' curves extending from some point @xmath150 which we used for the definition of the three entropies were clearly defined by means of our lattice only .",
    "so from the very definition we had our three entropies attached to the lattice .",
    "it is our next important subjects of works to study further detailed investigations of the properties of three entropy currents in two dimensional example and to generalize our method of constructing entropy currents into any dimensions .",
    "furthermore most importantly we will have to clarify the question whether all the three entropy currents are relevant ones in actual physical situation .",
