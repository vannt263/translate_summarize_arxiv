    "measurements of flavor changing neutral current processes provide some of the most stringent experimental tests of the standard model and its extensions . in the standard model , the smallness of quantities such as the @xmath2 mixing amplitude",
    "is linked to the fact that all such flavor changing amplitudes vanish at tree level , and can proceed only at higher orders in the weak interactions .",
    "because the standard model predictions are so small , these processes provide an excellent testing ground for extended models possessing new sources of flavor violation .    unfortunately , it is not always a simple task to convert the underlying quark - level weak amplitudes into robust predictions for the observed hadronic quantities .",
    "strong interaction effects can significantly modify the quark model estimates of decay rates .",
    "luckily , in the case of the @xmath0 mesons , the large mass @xmath3 of the @xmath4 quark makes it possible to systematically compute the effects of strong interactions in a double expansion in @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is an energy scale typical of hadronic quantities such as the hyperfine splitting in the heavy mesons .",
    "hence the rare @xmath0 decays @xmath8 and @xmath9 with @xmath10 are especially suitable as tools for testing the standard model and its extensions .    over the last year or so",
    ", there has been some theoretical progress pertaining to the inclusive @xmath11 transition . with respect to the perturbative calculations , the complete next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections",
    "have been completed , resulting in a significant reduction of the theoretical error .",
    "in addition , an interesting new class of non - perturbative corrections to the rate have been identified .",
    "these effects are of order @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the mass of the charm quark .",
    "such effects are potentially important , of order 10% or more .",
    "furthermore , they appear , on the face of it , to violate the expectations of heavy quark effective theory , which predicts that all such corrections are suppressed by inverse powers of the @xmath4 quark mass .    in the following section , we review the standard model prediction for the branching ratio @xmath14 . in sec .  3",
    ", we discuss the impact of supersymmetry on the rate , and estimate the range of superpartner masses that might be probed by improved measurements .",
    "sec .  4 concludes .",
    "in the standard model , the @xmath11 decay is mediated by the @xmath15 exchange diagrams shown in fig .",
    "1 . ignoring qcd corrections",
    ", these diagrams result in an effective lagrangian of the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 contains the dependence on the @xmath15 and top quark masses , and is given by @xmath18 perturbative qcd corrections can be included by use of the renormalization group equations , which enable us to scale the coefficient @xmath17 from a high scale @xmath19 to a low scale @xmath20 . in this way",
    ", the large logarithms of order @xmath21 can be resummed into the coefficient function @xmath22 , which now depends on the renormalization scale @xmath23 as well as the top and @xmath15 masses .",
    "the leading order qcd corrections have been known for some time @xcite , and the nlo corrections have recently been completed @xcite . in calculating the branching ratio ,",
    "it is convenient to normalize to the semileptonic width .",
    "this eliminates a large uncertainty arising from the usual factor @xmath24 appearing in weak decay rates .",
    "the ratio is given by @xmath25 here @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the phase space factor for the semileptonic width .",
    "@xmath28 includes the qcd correction to the semileptonic width , while @xmath29 is the qcd corrected value of @xmath22 , and @xmath30 gives the contribution from certain infrared logarithms appearing in the @xmath31 rate .",
    "the full expressions for @xmath32 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . finally , the quantity @xmath33 is the the correction due to non - perturbative binding effects , which we shall return to below .",
    "the important point here is the dependence on the renormalization scale @xmath34 .",
    "physical quantities should not depend on @xmath34 , although at any finite order of perturbation theory , some residual dependence on @xmath34 remains .",
    "typically @xmath34 should be chosen of order @xmath3 , but the variation of the prediction for a range of @xmath35 indicates the uncertainty resulting from higher order corrections . in leading order , this uncertainty is roughly 30% ; the inclusion of the nlo corrections reduces this to about 4% .",
    "apart from the perturbative corrections discussed so far , the rate is also modified by non - perturbative binding effects .",
    "these effects can be systematically calculated by means of the heavy quark effective theory @xcite together with the operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "since the energy release in @xmath0 decays is large compared to the typical strong interaction scale @xmath36 , the corrections can be organized as a series in powers of @xmath37 .",
    "the leading corrections are governed by the quark ` pole ' mass @xmath38 , a quantity @xmath39 that measures the mass of the light degrees of freedom in the meson , and finally two quantities @xmath40 of dimension mass@xmath41 that measure the fermi motion of the @xmath4 quark and the hyperfine splitting between the @xmath0 and @xmath42 mesons , respectively . @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be expressed in terms of @xmath0 meson matrix elements as @xmath45 the quantities @xmath46 and @xmath47 suffice to compute the non - perturbative effects through order @xmath48 . for the @xmath1 decay ,",
    "the rate is given by @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the quark - level decay rate .",
    "including the @xmath48 contribution to the semileptonic decay rate @xcite , we find that the ratio @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) is enhanced by roughly 1% through non - perturbative effects .",
    "note in particular that when the width is expressed in terms of the quark pole mass , the leading corrections are at order @xmath48 and hence are expected to be quite small .",
    "it has recently been shown that the inclusive @xmath52 rate is subject to corrections at order @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "on naive dimensional grounds , these corrections could be sizable .",
    "indeed , the scale of these effects is set by quantities like @xmath54 , so shifts of 10% or more are possible .",
    "the @xmath55 contribution to the inclusive rate comes from an amplitude involving the @xmath56 transition , where the @xmath57 pair annihilates into the final state photon after absorbing a soft gluon .",
    "the resulting loop diagram is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "similar loops involving @xmath58 and @xmath59 quarks can be safely neglected .",
    "the dependence of this diagram on the charm quark mass can be deduced using dimensional analysis @xcite . in terms of the photon and gluon momenta @xmath60 and @xmath61 ,",
    "the diagram depends on the invariants @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath13 . in the limit of an on shell photon and a very soft gluon ,",
    "all of the invariants involving four momenta vanish , and we conclude that the amplitude depends on @xmath13 only",
    ". explicit evaluation yields a new contribution to the weak effective lagrangian which mediates the @xmath65 transition : @xmath66 where @xmath67 @xcite is the coefficient of the @xmath68 four - fermi operator .",
    "including this term in the ope for the inclusive @xmath69 rate , we find a correction of order @xmath53 @xcite : @xmath70 in fact , the approximation leading to eq .",
    "( [ leading ] ) is not as robust as one might hope @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of the triangle diagram involves an integral of the form @xmath71},\\ ] ] which reduces to @xmath53 in the limit @xmath72 .",
    "in actuality , we have @xmath73 and @xmath74 ; however @xmath75 .",
    "hence the result ( [ leading ] ) , which involves setting @xmath64 to zero , is potentially subject to large corrections .",
    "these corrections manifest themselves as a series of higher dimension operators in @xmath76 .",
    "operators of dimension @xmath77 in this series will contribute to the inclusive rate by an amount proportional to @xmath78 .",
    "since @xmath79 , these subleading contributions are not suppressed by any small number .",
    "the first few higher dimension operators in the @xmath80 lagrangian can be found by expanding the charm loop integral in powers of @xmath81 .",
    "the effect of these terms on inclusive rate can be found as before using the ope : we have @xcite @xmath82 } b | b \\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have specialized to the rest frame of the @xmath0 meson , where to leading order @xmath83 .",
    "the first term in square brackets gives the leading contribution of eq .",
    "( [ leading ] ) , while the subsequent terms give the first two subleading corrections .",
    "in fact , the first subleading term vanishes at this level of approximation by virtue of the qcd analogue of the maxwell equation @xmath84 , together with the heavy quark equations of motion @xcite .",
    "the next subleading term is certainly negligible , owing to its small @xmath85 coefficient , which arises from solid angle factors in the photon phase space integration as well as small coefficients in the taylor expansion of the loop integral .",
    "the smallness of these corrections leads us to believe that the leading @xmath86 result of eq .",
    "( [ leading ] ) is in fact quantitatively correct .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether non - perturbative @xmath87 effects of this type might be important in other @xmath0 decays @xcite .",
    "the impact of the charm loop on @xmath88 has been estimated @xcite , and found to be similar to that in @xmath89 , of order a few percent .",
    "it is unlikely that corrections of this type could have a significant impact on the @xmath0 semileptonic branching ratio or the ratio of the @xmath90 and @xmath91 lifetimes .",
    "a comparison of @xmath92 with @xmath69 is one way to test for spin dependent effects of this type @xcite .",
    "since the light degrees of freedom in the @xmath0 carry spin 1/2 , while those in the @xmath91 carry spin 0 , we expect that the charm loop will have no effect on @xmath91 decays",
    ".    finally , we should point out that the @xmath53 contributions are not in conflict with heavy quark effective theory .",
    "indeed , in the hqet limit @xmath93 with @xmath13 fixed , the corrections are not proportional to @xmath53 and have a rather different form @xcite .",
    "the presence of these effects can be traced to a breakdown of the ope in processes where the final state photon is radiated from light quarks , rather than being produced directly in the @xmath94 transition @xcite .      assembling the ingredients of the previous subsections , the standard model prediction for the branching ratio is @xcite @xmath95 where the first error is due to renormalization scale dependence and",
    "the second is due to errors on the input parameters , which have been added in quadrature .",
    "a detailed accounting of the errors can be found in @xcite ; the dominant errors at present are due to the ratio of the @xmath4 and @xmath96 quark pole masses ( 5.3% ) , the semileptonic branching ratio ( 4% ) , and the renormalization scale dependence ( 4% ) , with smaller ( @xmath86 ) errors from @xmath97 , ckm angles , and the top quark mass .",
    "one promising way to reduce the theoretical error is through better determination of the quark pole masses .",
    "analyses of the lepton energy spectrum or the hadronic invariant mass spectrum in semileptonic decays have been proposed as means of extracting the pole masses @xcite .",
    "in addition , measurements of the photon energy spectrum in @xmath69 can be used to provide largely independent constraints on the hqet input parameters @xcite , including the pole masses .",
    "the prediction ( [ prediction ] ) is to be compared with measurements by cleo @xcite and aleph @xcite : @xmath98 for reasons discussed in @xcite , it is important to rely as little as possible on theoretical models of the photon energy spectrum in measuring the branching ratio .",
    "indeed , measurements of the spectrum can be used to refine our theoretical understanding of the @xmath0 system . as an example",
    ", the photon energy spectrum can be related to the lepton energy spectrum in inclusive semileptonic @xmath99 decays @xcite .",
    "the impact of new physics , and in particular supersymmetry , on flavor changing neutral currents is the subject of a vast and growing literature .",
    "the case of @xmath11 has been studied extensively @xcite . in this section",
    "we review some of the salient features of supersymmetry as it relates to flavor changing neutral currents in general and the @xmath1 decay in particular .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) predicts the existence of a scalar partner for each standard model fermion , and a fermionic partner for each gauge or higgs boson @xcite .",
    "the left- and right - handed fermions have separate scalar partners , which can have different masses and can mix with one another .",
    "in addition , softly broken supersymmetry requires at least one additional higgs doublet in order to generate masses for both up- and down - type quarks .",
    "the higgs spectrum then consists of two neutral scalars , a neutral pseudoscalar , and a charged higgs . when the electroweak symmetry is broken , the charged gauginos and higgsinos mix to form two dirac ` charginos , ' while the neutral gauginos and higgsinos mix to form four majorana ` neutralinos . '",
    "flavor changing neutral currents are problematic for general supersymmetric models .",
    "this is a consequence of flavor mixing among the squarks .",
    "if the squarks are non - degenerate and strongly mixed , the couplings of the gauginos and higgsinos will not conserve flavor .",
    "loops involving ( for instance ) squarks and gluinos can then give large contributions to flavor changing processes .",
    "hence there is a potential conflict between weak - scale supersymmetry and small flavor changing neutral currents @xcite .",
    "these problems are alleviated if it is assumed that the squarks are degenerate in mass .",
    "this is the case , for instance , in supergravity @xcite and gauge - mediated @xcite models of supersymmetry breaking . in this case",
    ", the gluinos and neutralinos have flavor - diagonal couplings , while the chargino couplings reduce to the usual standard model ckm matrix .",
    "renormalization effects break the degeneracy of the squarks . typically , the squarks will be degenerate at a high scale ( @xmath100 s of tev to @xmath101 , depending on the model ) where supersymmetry breaking is communicated to the standard model particles .",
    "when the squark masses are renormalized down to the weak scale , the squarks of the third generation are lighter than the others . even in the presence of this mass splitting , the gluino , neutralino , and chargino couplings",
    "are not strongly modified in comparison to the case of exact degeneracy .",
    "tests of ` minimal ' models of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking based on @xmath1 have been discussed in @xcite .    to illustrate the sensitivity of @xmath11 to high mass superpartners",
    ", we will consider a relatively benign scenario with the following parameters @xcite .",
    "all squarks , except for the lighter top squark @xmath102 , have a common mass of 500  gev .",
    "the light stop mass is set to 200  gev , and is taken to be a maximal mixture of @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets , @xmath105 , is equal to 3 , and the charged higgs mass is 600  gev .",
    "finally , we will assume that the neutralinos and gluinos have flavor diagonal couplings , while the chargino couplings are proportional to the standard model ckm matrix .",
    "in this limit , the dominant contributions to @xmath106 arise from loops involving @xmath15 and the top quark , the charged higgs and the top quark , and the charginos and the top squarks .",
    "the charged higgs enhances the rate , while the charginos can enhance or suppress the rate .",
    "consequently it is not possible to derive model - independent bounds on superparticle masses , although in non - supersymmetric two - doublet models , the lower bound on the charged higgs mass turns out to be around 340 gev @xcite . to compute the rate",
    ", we must specify two final parameters : @xmath23 , the higgsino mass parameter , and @xmath107 , the @xmath108 gaugino mass .",
    "these parameters determine masses and couplings of the charginos .",
    "3 qualitatively illustrates the dependence of @xmath14 on @xmath23 and @xmath107 for this choice of parameters .    for clarity of presentation ,",
    "we have shown only @xmath109 ; with this choice of stop mixing , the charginos enhance the rate for @xmath110 .",
    "the solid curves are contours of constant chargino mass , along which the lightest chargino has mass 100 , 200 , 300 , and 400  gev .",
    "the broken curves are contours along which the ratio @xmath111 is constant , with values 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.7 , and 0.9 .",
    "we see that deviations from the standard model at the 10 - 20% level are possible for chargino masses in the 300 - 400 gev range .",
    "consequently , improved measurements will continue to narrow the allowed region of susy parameter space .",
    "theoretical understanding of @xmath112 continues to improve .",
    "the completion of the nlo qcd corrections has dramatically reduced the uncertainty on the standard model prediction .",
    "the non - perturbative corrections of order @xmath48 are well understood , and the corrections of order @xmath53 , while unexpected , are both small and calculable .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath112 to new physics is quite remarkable , and we have reason to hope that improved measurements will continue to add to our knowledge of short  distance physics .",
    "improved measurements of the photon energy spectrum will also be an aid in our understanding of hadronic physics .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank peter schlein for organizing an enjoyable and informative meeting .",
