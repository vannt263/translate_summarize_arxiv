    "details of the star experiment can be found in  @xcite . for this analysis ,",
    "events with primary vertex within @xmath5 cm of the tpc center are used .",
    "the au+au events are divided into 7 centrality classes as in  @xcite .",
    "a large @xmath1 trigger particle is selected within the pseudo - rapidity and transverse momentum ranges of @xmath6@xmath00.75 and 4@xmath0@xmath3@xmath06  gev/@xmath2 .",
    "charged hadrons within 0.15@xmath0@xmath1@xmath04 gev/@xmath2 and @xmath7@xmath01.1 are associated with the trigger particle in @xmath8 and @xmath9 . acceptance and tracking efficiency are corrected for the associated particles .",
    "background is constructed by an event - mixing technique .",
    "the elliptic flow contribution , @xmath10 , is included .",
    "residual background effect is minimized by averaging the lowest data points ( mostly within 0.9@xmath0@xmath11@xmath01.3 ) to zero .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the background subtracted @xmath12 distributions .",
    "jet - like structures are observed in p+p and on the near side in au+au collisions .",
    "we define near side as within @xmath11@xmath01.1 and @xmath13@xmath01.4 and away side as within @xmath11@xmath141.1 and @xmath7@xmath01.1 .",
    "we integrate the correlation signals as a measure of the jet charged hadron multiplicities .",
    "the near side signal is corrected for two - particle @xmath15 acceptance .",
    "we deduce the total scalar @xmath1 by applying a multiplicative factor of 1.5 to the associated particles to account for the neutral particles ; we include the trigger particle @xmath3 for the near jet .",
    "systematic uncertainties on our measurements come from three major sources : those in ( i ) elliptic flow corrections , ( ii ) background normalization , and ( iii ) efficiency corrections .",
    "the estimated systematic uncertainties are shown on the results where indicated .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the charged hadron multiplicity and total scalar @xmath1 on both the near and away side in p+p and as a function of centrality in au+au collisions .",
    "the trigger particle is included in the near side results .",
    "we note that the away side measurements are those within the acceptance only , whereas those measured on the near side correspond to a nearly complete jet . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , by triggering on a large @xmath1 particle , higher energy jets are selected in central au+au than in p+p collisions .",
    "the charged hadron multiplicity and total scalar @xmath1 are found to increase from p+p to central au+au collisions for both the near and away side .",
    "figure  [ fig3](a - b ) shows the @xmath1 distributions of associated particles in p+p , peripheral 80 - 40% and central 5% au+au collisions .",
    "while general agreement is found between p+p and peripheral au+au , the central au+au results differ from p+p , most significantly for the away side .",
    "the away side in central au+au is depleted at large @xmath1 and enhanced at low @xmath1 compared to p+p collisions",
    ". the ratios of au+au to p+p distributions are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c - d ) .",
    "it appears that jets are modified in the medium created in au+au collisions ; the modification results in more associated particles on the near side and moves energy from high to low @xmath1 on the away side .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the centrality dependence of @xmath16 of associated charged hadrons on the away side .",
    "also shown is the @xmath16 of inclusive hadrons that make up the medium .",
    "the away side @xmath16 is significantly larger than that for inclusive hadrons in p+p and peripheral au+au collisions , and drops significantly with centrality in au+au collisions , approaching the medium hadron @xmath16 .",
    "this may indicate a progressive equilibration between the associated hadrons and the medium from peripheral to central collisions .",
    "borghini _ et al .",
    "_  estimated , on a statistical basis , effect on two - particle correlation due to global momentum conservation  @xcite .",
    "such an effect would yield a correlation of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the near side jet @xmath1 and the summations run over all particles ( denominator ) and those in the acceptance only ( numerator ) .",
    "an estimate of such a correlation with a constant offset is shown as the band in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( see also ref .",
    "the curve shows a free fit to the data with the sum of a gaussian ( for near side ) , a @xmath19 term ( for away side ) , and a constant offset ; it appears to describe the away side distributions well , especially for central collisions .",
    "this may suggest that the away side associated particles are reaching equilibration with the medium , in consistency with the softening of the @xmath1 spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "statistical reconstruction of charged hadron jets is performed for p+p and au+au collisions at rhic by correlating charged hadrons in the @xmath1 range of 0.15@xmath0@xmath1@xmath04 gev/@xmath2 to large @xmath1 particles within 4@xmath0@xmath3@xmath06 gev/@xmath2 and subtracting mixed - event background .",
    "preliminary results on charged hadron multiplicity , total scalar @xmath1 , and associated charged hadron @xmath1 distribution are presented for both the near and away side .",
    "it is found , with the same @xmath3 leading particle in the final state , that the total scalar @xmath1 is larger in central au+au than in p+p collisions , and increases gradually with centrality .",
    "the @xmath1 distribution of associated charged hadrons on the away side is found to be significantly softened in central au+au with respect to p+p collisions , suggesting a significant equilibration of those hadrons with the medium .",
    "the results are consistent with modification of jets in nuclear medium created at rhic .",
