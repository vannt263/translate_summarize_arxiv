    ". this data is , in principle , especially well suited to constraining ( or detecting ) small amplitude oscillations in the power spectrum which would show up as a peak in the correlation function .",

    "it may be more convenient to work with the potential slow roll parameters instead , which use derivatives of the potential instead of derivatives of the hubble parameter .",
    "the first three potential slow roll parameters are defined by @xmath43 if the attractor condition ( eq .  ) is satisfied , the two are approximately related via @xcite @xmath44 up to corrections of third and higher orders . expressed in terms of the potential slow roll parameters , @xmath17",

    "let us now turn back to eq .  , which is basically the equation of an oscillator with a time dependent mass term , and discuss its solutions .",
    "the initial conditions imply that for wavenumbers with @xmath52 i.e. , with wavelengths much smaller than the horizon , the solution is given by equation and @xmath14 describes a circular motion in the complex plane . due to the exponential growth of the scale factor",
    ", the physical wavelenghts will be blown up and leave the horizon , eventually satisfying . in this limit",
    ", the growing solution for @xmath14 is given by @xmath53    hence , the spectrum @xmath0 will converge to a constant value for super - hubble modes , i.e. , the perturbations `` freeze in '' .",
    "we can also conclude that the fate of a perturbation with wavelength @xmath32 is decided when @xmath54 and the spectrum will have its final shape imprinted on horizon exit .",
    "it is not until much later , when the modes reenter the horizon during radiation or matter domination , that they will exhibit dynamical behaviour again .",
    "generically , the power spectrum will not be scale independent , with a scale dependence being induced by the variation of , e.g. , the potential energy and the hubble parameter as the inflaton field rolls down the potential . in the slow roll regime",
    ", however , the scale dependence is rather weak and @xmath0 can be reasonably well approximated by a power law : @xmath55 with the normalisation @xmath56 given by @xmath57 and the spectral index @xmath58    before we talk about relaxing some of the assumptions that went into this analysis , let us quickly mention inflationary tensor perturbations .",
    "apart from the scalar perturbations described above , inflation also generates tensor perturbations , with a spectrum given by @xmath59 and the mode equation @xmath60    this equation is very similar to the scalar one .",
    "this similarity can be readily seen if we express the `` mass term '' @xmath61 in terms of the slow roll parameters : @xmath62\\\\           & \\simeq 2 a^2 h^2 \\left [ 1 - \\tfrac{1}{2 } \\epsilon +          \\tfrac{2}{3 } \\epsilon^2 - \\tfrac{1}{3 } \\epsilon \\eta           + \\mathcal{o}(3 ) \\right].\\nonumber      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    just like the scalar modes , tensor perturbations will also freeze in at horizon exit . in the slow roll case",
    "their spectrum is approximately @xmath63 with the tensor spectral index @xmath64 and normalisation @xmath65",
    "the validity of the power - law parameterisation of the primordial spectra rests on the assumptions that the slow - roll parameters are small and change slowly with time .",
    "let us relax the latter and allow @xmath66 and @xmath67 to change significantly on a timescale @xmath68 .",
    "this has the consequence that we can also allow @xmath66 and/or @xmath67 to become of order unity momentarily , provided that at a later time , the system returns to the slow roll regime .",
    "we also assume here that the system starts in a state where the slow roll conditions are fulfilled , in order to give it enough time to reach the inflationary attractor solution .",
    "this effect can be modelled by adding a local feature , such as a step or a bump , to an otherwise flat inflaton potential .",
    "let us examine the consequences of such a feature using as an example the same model potential as in @xcite @xmath69 this potential describes standard @xmath70 chaotic inflation @xcite with a step centered around @xmath71 .",
    "the height of the step is determined by @xmath72 , its gradient by @xmath73 .",
    "we do not want inflation to be interrupted by the step , so we stipulate @xmath74 to ensure that the potential energy will always dominate over the kinetic one .",
    "as pointed out above , the eventual spectrum crucially depends on the dynamics of @xmath17 , which can easily be deduced from the solution of equations and . for a typical choice of parameters , we plot the numerical solution in figure [ zz ] .",
    "generically , we find that @xmath75 has a maximum before the inflaton field reaches @xmath76 , a minimum shortly afterwards and it will return to the asymptotic slow roll value of @xmath77 after @xmath78 @xmath20-folding .",
    "comparison with the hubble slow roll parameters ( fig .",
    "[ hsr ] ) shows that this behaviour is mainly caused by @xmath79 and @xmath80 , while @xmath81 remains small .",
    "this is a consequence of the condition @xmath82 .",
    "beware that the potential slow roll approximation eq .",
    "will in general not work for this potential since the contribution of higher derivative terms can be large .",
    "the smallness of @xmath83 ( and hence @xmath66 ) also implies that there will not be any sizable deviations from a power law for the spectrum of tensor perturbations .",
    "so , how will this particular behaviour of @xmath17 influence the solution for @xmath14 and eventually the spectrum compared to a model with no step ? it is obvious that modes with @xmath84 , i.e. , modes that are well within the horizon at the time of the step , will not be affected at all and @xmath14 will remain in the oscillatory regime . for @xmath85 , the maximum in @xmath17 will result in a boost of exponential growth for @xmath14 , reverting to oscillations",
    "when @xmath17 goes negative and eventually return to the growing solution .",
    "we depict the motion of @xmath14 in the complex plane in fig .",
    "[ circles ] .",
    "when an oscillatory phase is preceded by a growing phase , the initial circle will be distorted to an ellipse . as the growth sets in again",
    ", the the mode will be suppressed or enhanced , depending on the phase of the oscillation , which itself is @xmath32-dependent . in the spectrum , this can be observed as oscillations .",
    "this mechanism will be most effective for modes that are just leaving the horizon , for modes with @xmath86 the phase difference will be negligible .    hence , a localised feature in the potential will lead to a localised `` burst '' of oscillations in the spectrum ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , while large and small scales will remain unchanged with respect to the spectra of the asymptotic background models .",
    "this is shown in fig .",

    "@xmath87 and @xmath88 ( solid black line ) with wavenumber @xmath32 given in units of @xmath89 .",
    "the dotted red line depicts the spectrum of the same model with @xmath72 set to zero .",
    "[ spectrex ] ]    note that the wavelengths affected by the feature are those that are about to leave the horizon as the inflaton field reaches the centre of the step .",
    "in particular , also the frequency of the oscillations of the spectrum is proportional to this scale .",
    "what remains is to identify the horizon size at the step with a physical scale today .",
    "this connection can be made if one knows the total number of @xmath20-foldings @xmath90 of inflation that took place after a known physical scale @xmath91 left the horizon . technically , we evolve the background equations ( [ heq],[phieq ] ) until the end of inflation @xmath92 , ( defined by @xmath93 ) .",
    "the scale @xmath91 can then be determined in units of @xmath89 via @xmath94 as long as the spectrum of the @xmath95 background model is only mildly scale dependent , there will be a strong degeneracy between @xmath90 and @xmath76 : shifting the feature in the potential will have the same effect as shifting the scale of @xmath32 . in the following",
    "we will therefore not treat @xmath90 as a free parameter , but set @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "if we want the feature to affect scales that are within reach of current observations , this will require @xmath76 to lie in the interval @xmath98 .",
    "having analysed a specific example in the previous subsection , let us now address the question of model dependence : will we arrive at different conclusions if we modify the background inflationary model ( e.g. , @xmath99 instead of @xmath70 ) or the parameterisation of the step",
    "?    we will argue that a more general potential @xmath100 leads to a qualitatively similar spectrum as the potential . here , @xmath101 is the background potential , which should fulfil the slow roll conditions with @xmath102 and @xmath103 positive definite .",
    "the function @xmath104 parameterises the step , and should monotonically asymptote to @xmath105 ( @xmath82 ) for @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively , with @xmath108 .    as we have seen above , the derivatives of the potential are crucial to determining the spectrum . in general , the derivatives of @xmath109 are given by @xmath110    far away from the step , the derivatives of @xmath111 will be negligible and the potential and its derivatives are approximately @xmath112 since the slow roll conditions hold here , the spectrum will be given by eq . with @xmath113 in the special case @xmath114 , we have exactly and . if @xmath115 , there are additional corrections of order @xmath72 to the normalisation and also corrections to the tilt , which are suppressed by @xmath72 and the slow - roll parameters of the background model . in both cases ,",
    "one asymptotically recovers the spectrum of the background model in the limit @xmath82 .    near the step , however , the derivatives of @xmath109 will have a contribution from the derivatives of @xmath111 . if the step is sharp enough , the @xmath116th derivative of @xmath109 will be dominated by the @xmath116th derivative of @xmath111 , since the other terms are suppressed with factors of the order of the slow roll parameters of the background model .",
    "hence , the dynamics of @xmath17 near the step hardly depends on the background , but is determined by the form of @xmath111 . on the other hand , any @xmath111 that gives a @xmath17 which roughly shows a behaviour like the one depicted in fig .",

    "spectra of this type will arise from potentials of the form eq .  .",
    "while the fine details of particular models may differ slightly from this approximation , eq .   will nevertheless capture the broad features of a large class of background models , since , as argued above , the shape of the burst of oscillations is largely independent of the background model .",

    "the asymptotic behaviour of models with @xmath114 will be reproduced exactly ; for @xmath134 it will be approximate , with errors of order @xmath72 .",
    "there is a catch however : in this analysis the parameters @xmath76 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 will be bereaved of their meaning as parameters of the potential .",
    "instead , they should be interpreted as phenomenological parameters which describe the spectrum .",
    "this does not preclude us from deriving meaningful constraints , though .",
    "we argued that the shape of the modulation of the spectrum is largely independent of the background , so similar modulations should be the consequence of similar step dynamics .",

    "the standard procedure is outlined in section 4.2 of ref .",
    "@xcite and involves corrections for redshift space distortion , nonlinear clustering , scale dependent bias , and a smoothing of features on small scales due to mode coupling .",
    "all of these methods were calibrated with nonlinear simulations in a vanilla cosmology setting and it is not obvious that they should be applicable to our case . with the exception of the smoothing , however , the effect of these corrections on the correlation function is smaller than 10% and will only be noticable at scales @xmath170 mpc ( see figure 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "so even if we assume a large uncertainty in the nonlinear corrections , the accuracy of the theoretical correlation function will still be of order a few per cent , that is smaller than the error bars of the data .",
    "let us look at the smoothing procedure in a bit more detail .",
    "in the usual case , the dewiggled transfer function @xmath171 is a weighted interpolation between the linear transfer function @xmath172 and the eisenstein - hu @xcite no - wiggle transfer function @xmath173 @xmath174 with a weight function @xmath175 $ ] and mpc .",
    "this is related to the dewiggled spectrum by @xmath176    in the case of a non - smooth primordial power spectrum @xmath12 , one should of course also dewiggle the initial features . in order to recover the standard procedure for power - law spectra , we will instead smooth the quantity @xmath177    the use of the no - wiggle transfer function rests on the assumption that at small scales , mode coupling will totally erase all structure , which is reasonable as long as the amplitude of features is of the same order as that of the baryon oscillations . for much larger oscillations ,",
    "mode coupling might not be efficient enough to erase all structure ; it is likely that some residual oscillations will remain .",

    "the dewiggled power spectrum is then given by @xmath183    without turning to @xmath21-body simulations it would be hard to estimate how much the spectrum will have to be smoothed , though .",
    "therefore , we will determine the bao likelihood @xmath184 by marginalising over @xmath182 : @xmath185",

    "fixing the tilt near the best fit value will reduce the errors on the parameters it is degenerate with , which is precisely what is happening here .    ]    the distributions for models a and c show a remarkable similarity which leads us to conclude that the presence of a feature will not have any statistically significant influence on the results for the parameters of the vanilla model .",

    "the former corresponds to oscillations at large scales ( @xmath189 ) , while the latter has oscillations of a wavelength similar to the baryonic acoustic oscillations and lies near the third peak of the cmb temperature power spectrum . adding small scale cmb data and , in particular , the power spectrum data of the 2003 data release of the sdss @xcite , improved the fit of the small scale maximum to @xmath190 .    in the present work",

    "this is a further indication that the presence of a feature at large scales will not affect the estimates of the other parameters .",
    "going from model b to the generalised step model will slightly improve the quality of the fits , yielding an extra @xmath191 of 1 - 2 .",

    "the difference between the mean and marginalised likelihoods is due to a volume effect : integration over the low @xmath72 plateau of the likelihood function tends to suppress peaks in the marginalised likelihood , which show up more clearly in the mean likelihood .    finally , we display constraints on the maximum values of the slow roll parameters of the step function in fig .",

    "are still allowed .",
    "note , however , that these bounds are parameterisation dependent ( they assume a @xmath199-form of the step ) , and , for @xmath200 , not only @xmath135 , but also higher order potential slow roll parameters will be non - negligible .    ]",
    "we have analysed the dynamics of single - field inflation models with a step - like feature of small amplitude in the inflaton potential .",
    "generically , the resulting spectrum of scalar perturbations will resemble that of the stepless background model with a superimposed burst of oscillations whose shape is determined by the form of the step only .",
    "we have confronted the theoretical predictions for the spectrum of a specific chaotic inflation model with a step with recent cosmological data to find out whether the data require the presence of such a feature and whether it may actually bias the estimates of other cosmological parameters such as , e.g. , the baryon density .",
    "we have also repeated the same analysis for a more empirical but less model dependent spectrum , such as might be expected from a step in an arbitrary inflationary background model .    with a combination of different data sets , a large chunk of the step model parameter space can be ruled out , only spectra with a very modest oscillation amplitude are still consistent with observations .",
    "the bao data , in particular , prove to be a very sensitive probe for oscillating spectra .    compared to the 6 parameter `` vanilla '' cosmological model , using the most constraining data set , we find an improvement of the best fit @xmath201 of about @xmath202 for the chaotic inflation step model which comprises two extra parameters , and @xmath203 for the generalised step model , which has three extra parameters .",
    "the vanilla model is a subset of the class of generalised step models for @xmath204 . if @xmath205 , the resulting spectrum will be virtually indestiguishable from the vanilla spectrum . with our choice of priors , contours of greater than @xmath206 confidence level",
    "will contain parts of this vanilla region of parameter space .",
    "hence , we can not exclude the vanilla model at more than 20% confidence level . reversing the argument",
    ", the present data do not show compelling evidence for requiring a spectrum with an oscillatory feature of the type discussed above .",
    "we expect that a more sophisticated model selection analysis along the lines of refs .",
    "@xcite would lead to a similar conclusion .",
    "the best fit region of parameter space consists of models which show oscillations at wavelengths corresponding to multipoles @xmath207 , where the temperature - temperature correlation data of the cmb shows some glitches .",
    "interestingly , the time it would take the inflaton field to traverse the step in these models is of the order of an @xmath20-folding , which is what one would expect for the time of a phase transition in more realistic multi - field models .    whether the glitches are just statistical flukes or stem from a physical effect , such as a feature in the inflaton potential , can not be conclusively decided until we have better measurements of the @xmath208- and @xmath209-mode polarisation spectra from experiments like planck @xcite or , in the more distant future , projects like the inflation probe @xcite .",
