    "galaxy morphology is influenced by environment .",
    "this is illustrated at the most basic level by the difference in the morphological mix of galaxies in high density galaxy clusters and low density groups , or the field . in the local universe ,",
    "the highest density environments of massive cluster cores are composed almost exclusively of early - type galaxies , i.e. ellipticals and lenticulars ( s0s ) , while in the field , gas - rich disks and irregular galaxies dominate . in the lower density field and in low - mass groups , interactions and mergers",
    "are linked to enhanced star formation rates and starbursts @xcite .",
    "it might be expected that ram pressure from a dense intracluster medium ( icm ) compresses molecular clouds and triggers a starburst @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is not intuitively clear if gas - rich galaxies infalling into high density clusters would have increased or decreased star formation rates relative to the field . in intermediate redshift",
    "cluster samples , the star formation rates of cluster galaxies are _ suppressed _ relative to the field , even when the different morphological mix is accounted for @xcite . while the star formation rates in clusters increase as a function of redshift , they are still lower than the star formation rates in the field population at that redshift .",
    "the mechanism by which star formation in cluster galaxies is suppressed is still unclear , but there is substantial evidence that suppression , not enhancement , is the dominant outcome @xcite .",
    "two of the most widely discussed mechanisms for star formation suppression are ram pressure stripping @xcite , and a more gentle form of galaxy - icm interaction termed starvation @xcite",
    ". both of these mechanisms may operate with varying degrees of importance , but stripping is expected to quench star formation rapidly ( @xmath6  myr ; e.g. quilis , moore , & bower 2000 ) , whereas starvation leads to a decline in the star formation rate over a longer timescale ( @xmath7  gyr ; e.g. bekki , couch , & shioya 2002 ) .",
    "the other mechanism of note is galaxy harassment , where galaxy - galaxy interactions combined with the tidal field of the cluster are expected to lead to strong mass loss and a drastic change in morphology @xcite .    in the virgo cluster ,",
    "ram pressure stripping is the leading explanation for the observation that gas - deficient dwarf galaxies are found in regions of higher x - ray surface brightness @xcite .",
    "also in virgo , there is direct evidence for ram pressure stripping of spiral galaxies in the form of hi and @xmath8 `` bow - shock '' morphology @xcite .",
    "further evidence for the importance of galaxy - icm interactions comes from a study by smith ( 2003 ) , who found that the hot x - ray halos of cluster early - type galaxies are missing , showing that stripping of gas halos occurs in dense environments .",
    "also , the existence of cluster passive spirals , galaxies with spiral structure but no detected star formation , can also be interpreted as evidence for ram pressure strippping @xcite . however , the importance of ram pressure stripping and starvation on the morphology - density relation as a whole has yet to be determined .",
    "due to degenerate outcomes in color - morphology space of vastly different formation scenarios , we must observe at higher redshifts to probe the dominant processes in producing the morphology - environment correlations seen in the present day universe .",
    "cl0152 - 1357 ( @xmath0 ) was observed as part of an ongoing project with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) to obtain imaging of intermediate redshift cluster galaxies , with the goal of tracing the evolution of cluster galaxy properties . in this paper",
    "we combine morphological information from acs imaging with ground - based spectroscopy to characterize the population of star - forming cluster galaxies , and to provide constraints on the mechanisms which influence the evolution of the star - forming population in clusters .",
    "we begin our investigation of how the properties of star - forming galaxies depend on environment in   3 by establishing the morphologies , colors , and locations of our sample galaxies . in   4",
    "we calculate star formation rates for individual galaxies , and use these to derive an integrated star formation rate for the cluster .",
    "we compare this to other clusters at low to intermediate redshift in   5 , and explore relationships with redshift , @xmath9 , and @xmath4 . in   6",
    "we discuss the possibility that ram pressure stripping is responsible for extinguishing star formation in cl0152 - 1357 , and in   7 we discuss the likely fate of the star - forming galaxies . in   8 , we present our conclusions .",

    "there also appears to be structure in addition to the two massive components .",

    "redshift completeness fractions were determined by counting the number of galaxies in the field of view within the specified magnitude ( color , morphology ) limits compared to the fraction of those with redshifts .",
    "the sample of 100 field galaxies used in   3.1 is from the spectroscopic sample of confirmed non - cluster members with redshifts and acs coverage .",

    "figure  [ sfrgalaxies ] shows @xmath36 color cutouts of the star - forming cluster members .",
    "morphologies were determined by visual classifications on the t - type system @xcite . all galaxies in the field with @xmath37 magnitude",

    "there was no significant offset between the mean classification from the independent classifiers .",
    "visual morphologies of the cluster members with evidence for ongoing star formation , indicated by the detection of [ oii ] emission , fall into three categories : red cluster sequence _",
    "spiral _ galaxies ( sa and earlier ) , compact ( @xmath39  kpc ) early - type galaxies ( @xmath40 ) , and irregular / late - type spiral galaxies ( @xmath41 ) that are typically expected to have star formation .",
    "only one of the galaxies ( 2016 ) is highly disturbed , indicative of a major merger .    in figure  [ morfhist ]",
    "we present histograms of the visually classified morphologies for galaxies with and without emission lines .",
    "for the cluster galaxies , we see a clear correlation of morphology with star formation , which is absent in the field sample .",
    "also , the distribution of morphological types is different between cluster and field , with a significant number of disky galaxies in the field sample , and early - type morphologies in the cluster sample .",
    "five of the star - forming cluster members have early - type morphologies and compact appearances .",
    "we fit 2d light profiles to the psf - convolved @xmath19 images using galfit @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tab : compacts ] .",
    "we fit a single sersic profile where the surface brightness varies as @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "a profile with @xmath43 is a de vaucouleurs profile , and one with @xmath44 describes an exponential disk .",
    "we find that these compact early - type cluster members have effective radii ranging from @xmath45  kpc .",
    "this is lower than the mean of 3.4  kpc from 53 early - type ( t @xmath46 ) cluster member galaxies .",
    "thus , we are able to confirm their visually compact appearance .",
    "the low measured @xmath47 values for these compact early - type galaxies is consistent the trend of magnitude and surface brightness profile found for e and de galaxies in the nearby universe @xcite .",
    "none of the early - type galaxies with [ oii ] is a luminous point source in the 37ks _ chandra _ image .",
    "these galaxies have narrow [ oii ] @xmath48 emission lines , and none has [ neiii ] @xmath49 ; broad lines and [ neiii ] @xmath49 are typical of active nuclei . for galaxy 1006=10871 ,",
    "we also detect [ oiii ] @xmath50 and h@xmath51 , and we can apply a diagnostic criteria from @xcite .",
    "we find log([oiii]@xmath50/h@xmath51)=0.3 and log([oii]@xmath48/h@xmath51)=0.6 , locating it within the hii galaxy regime , but in a region also populated by liners .",
    "thus we can not rule out an active nucleus origin for the [ oii ] emission .",
    "this applies to all galaxies in our sample , however , these compact early - type galaxies lack properties typical of star - forming galaxies , such as a patchy appearance ( indicating the presence of gas and dust ) .      in figure  [ cmd ]",
    "we present a histogram of the @xmath1 values for cluster member galaxies with and without detected star formation .",
    "there is a strong segregation in the @xmath1 colors of star - forming and non - star - forming galaxies .",
    "while the star - forming galaxies range in color from blue to red , galaxies without detected star formation are almost exclusively red .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that with reliable photometric redshifts , a simple color selection to separate the star - forming and passive cluster populations is fairly robust ( e.g. gray et  al .",
    "however , such a selection is not well suited to study the overall properties of the star - forming cluster members ; there is a small but significant fraction of red star - forming galaxies .",
    "the red cluster sequence ( rcs ) is the prominent red ridge in color magnitude diagrams of large galaxy samples . in low redshift clusters",
    ", it is composed exclusively of ellipticals and s0s .",
    "however in this galaxy sample we have rcs members with current star formation as indicated by the presence of [ oii ] emission , also noted in @xcite . to calculate the fraction of rcs galaxies with ongoing star formation , we need the completeness of our spectroscopic survey as a function of magnitude , and the magnitude distribution of the red cluster sequence ( rcs ) galaxies . the redshift completeness as a function of color",
    "is shown in figure  [ selfunc ] .",
    "galaxy selection was biased towards red galaxies .",
    "after correcting for color , there was also a @xmath52% bias towards early - type morphologies , but we will neglect this correction as it is much smaller than the color bias .    to define the red cluster sequence we take all non - stellar objects with @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we iteratively fit a linear relation to this sample with @xmath55 clipping .",
    "the color - magnitude relation defining the red cluster sequence for cl0152 - 1357 is thus    @xmath56    the standard deviation about this relation is 0.07 magnitudes , and we define an object as an rcs member if its deviation is less than @xmath57 , or @xmath58 magnitudes , from this relation .",
    "a more detailed explanation of the red cluster sequence will be presented in blakeslee et  al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the deviation in magnitudes from the rcs , @xmath59  rcs , is given in column 8 of table  [ sfrs ] .",
    "there are 8 galaxies with colors placing them in the rcs .",
    "of the rcs galaxies with spectra , how many show evidence for star formation ? there are spectra for 73 rcs cluster member galaxies . of these 73 , 44 are brighter than @xmath60 , and 6 of the 44 have evidence for star formation ( @xmath61% ) . if we choose a slightly fainter magnitude limit of @xmath62 , then the number of rcs cluster member galaxies with spectra is 65 , and 8 have detected [ oii ] ( @xmath63% ) .    after correcting for color bias in the redshift incompleteness fractions , there is a slight bias against galaxies with late - type morphologies ( t@xmath64 ) .",
    "we conclude that the fraction of rcs galaxies with ongoing star formation in cl@xmath13 is @xmath65 .",
    "we note that this is an underestimate , because we have access only to [ oii ] in emission as our star formation indicator .      in figure  [ pos ]",
    "we show the _ chandra _ contour map with the positions of the cluster members indicated as solid dots , and the edges of the acs mosaic as dotted lines .",
    "the star - forming galaxies are marked according to their morphology : triangles , squares , and diamonds represent compact galaxies , spirals / irregulars , and rcs spirals .",
    "a similar figure without the morphological imformation can be found in @xcite .",
    "we find no star - forming galaxies within the main x - ray peaks , that is , within a contour value of 0.3 counts s@xmath12 .",
    "considering the area between the two main x - ray peaks as the center , there appears to be a sharp transition around @xmath66  kpc ( @xmath67  kpc from the center of the southern cluster ) , within which we find almost no star - forming galaxies .",
    "we note that if the distribution of cluster galaxies is spherically symmetric , a few might be expected simply from projection effects . however , there are also few spectroscopically confirmed cluster members within @xmath68  kpc to the northwest and southeast of the northern cluster .",
    "therefore , the radius at which this transition occurs is not well constrained by our observations .",
    "star formation rates are derived from [ ] emission line luminosities .",
    "there are a few prescriptions for converting [ oii ] line fluxes to star formation rates ( gallagher , hunter , & bushouse 1989 , kennicut 1992 , kewley , geller , & jansen 2004 ) .",

    "systematic errors in [ oii ] derived sfrs arise from metallicity and extinction effects . for field galaxies in the nearby universe ,",
    "both of these quantities have been shown to correlate with @xmath72-band luminosity ( e.g. jansen , franx , & fabricant 2001 ) .",
    "because we have no information about metallicity or dust extinction , and how these might scale with luminosity for our sample , we have not included these corrections .",
    "they should therefore be considered lower limits on the true sfrs . in the next section",
    "we assume an average internal extinction of 1 magnitude at h@xmath70 for comparison with other studies .",
    "we convert our line fluxes to luminosities by assuming all galaxies are at the cluster distance ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "the emission - line fluxes were measured by fitting single gaussian profiles interactively using splot in iraf .",
    "we fit several spectra on five separate occasions to estimate errors on our flux measurements due to continuum selection . for the highest line fluxes ,",
    "the errors were @xmath74% , while for the lowest , errors approached 20% . combining this error with the error on the sf prescription , errors on our sfrs range from @xmath75% .",
    "a representative l[oii ] error of 10% results in a sfr error of @xmath76% .",
    "ews were also measured interactively with splot in iraf on background - subtracted but non - flux calibrated spectra .",
    "ews were estimated as the mean of 5 separate measurements , and the quoted errors are the maximum deviation from the mean measurement .",
    "we can set a @xmath57 limit on the sfr for those galaxies where the [ oii ] line was not detected .",
    "a typical [ oii ] emission line width for the star - forming galaxies in our sample is 11 .",
    "we set the @xmath57 limit as twice the standard deviation in counts within @xmath77  of the wavelength of the redshifted [ oii ] .",
    "we then relate the mean counts to the mean flux to arrive at upper limits for sfrs .",
    "these are below 1.0  m@xmath78 for all galaxies ( with two exceptions ) . for comparison ,",
    "the lowest measured sfr is 0.12  m@xmath16  yr@xmath12 .",
    "this reflects the widely varying quality of the spectroscopic sample .",
    "the distribution of our sfr limits is shown in figure  [ sflimits ] .",
    "the smallest slit width for the spectroscopic observations is @xmath79 . with the exception of 3 galaxies , the effective radii of all identified star - forming cluster members",
    "are less than @xmath79 , and the seeing was @xmath80 , so we do not apply an aperture correction .",
    "due to the small number of galaxies in our sample and redshift completeness effects with color , we choose not to compute the fraction of sf galaxies with density or radius as it is fraught with uncertainty due to selection effects . to minimize discrepancies due to differences in survey characteristics , @xcite compared integrated sfrs , which are dominated by galaxies with the largest star formation rates .",
    "a comparison of integrated sfrs is more accurate than a fractional comparison .",
    "here we compare the overall star - forming properties of cl0152 - 1357 to that of other clusters at low to intermediate redshift .",
    "the spatial limits of the lower redshift cluster studies determine a limit of @xmath81 for comparison .",
    "@xmath82 is the radius where the mean cluster density is 200 times the critical density of the universe , @xmath83 , at that redshift .",

    ".    in comparing our results we must include corrections for completeness and extinction . also , because this is a merging cluster , it is not straightforward to choose a cluster center",
    ". we discuss these issues in the following sections .",
    "compared to an imaging survey , a spectroscopic survey suffers significantly more from incompleteness .",
    "we will correct for this using the redshift completeness as a function of color and magnitude , but first we estimate the validity of our incompleteness correction by considering the cluster cl0023 , which has spectroscopic narrow - band imaging data .",
    "70% of the star forming galaxies and 65% of the star formation was missed in the spectroscopic survey versus the imaging survey covering the same area @xcite . correcting for this incompleteness should be the same as correcting for incompleteness in the redshift survey @xcite . of the 23 galaxies in the finn",

    "the cumulative completeness of the spectroscopic survey is @xmath91 at @xmath90 , and @xmath92 at @xmath93 .",
    "therefore the incompleteness is @xmath94% , in good agreement with the narrow - band imaging results .",
    "thus , when we compute the normalized integrated star formation rate below , we correct for incompleteness using the redshift completeness function presented in figure  [ selfunc ] .      for the galaxies where we detect [ oii ] ,",
    "our star formation rates are underestimated due to reddening . from the nearby galaxies",
    "survey , @xcite established that there is a luminosity - extinction relation , in the sense that more luminous galaxies have larger @xmath95 .",
    "however , the scatter in this relation is large , and it is unclear if intermediate redshift cluster galaxies follow the same relation as the local star - forming population .",
    "therefore , to correct for extinction , we follow convention and assume 1 magnitude of internal extinction at h@xmath70 , @xmath96 ( e.g. balogh & morris 2000 , couch et  al . 2001 ; balogh et  al .",
    "2002 , finn et  al .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath97 magnitudes at @xmath48 using the galactic extinction law of @xcite .",
    "we thus correct our fluxes by a factor of 5.25 .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to @xmath81 , then the choice of a cluster center is an important one .",
    "the distribution of cluster galaxies and the x - ray emission are elongated . in the spectroscopic survey ,",
    "more star - forming galaxies are detected at the southern end of the cluster .",
    "in fact , if we choose the center of the northern clump as @xmath98 , then we have no star - forming galaxies within @xmath81 . our integrated sfr changes from 4.5 m@xmath16  yr@xmath12 with 5 galaxies , to 5.3 m@xmath16  yr@xmath12 with 8 galaxies if @xmath98 is between the clumps or on the southern clump .",
    "if we were to take @xmath82 instead of @xmath81 , the integrated sfr would not depend significantly on the choice of cluster center , changing at most from 19.1 to 19.9 m@xmath16  yr@xmath12 .",
    "we choose a point between the two massive clusters as the cluster center : 01:52:41.55 , @xmath9913:57:56.7 . our observed , uncorrected integrated star formation rate is @xmath100  m@xmath16  yr@xmath12 .",
    "next we correct this for incompleteness and extinction .",
    "four of these galaxies have @xmath101 , are brighter than @xmath102 , and have a mean sfr of 1.1  m@xmath16  yr@xmath12 .",
    "we measure a cumulative completeness of 0.17 for galaxies with @xmath103 , and 0.23 for galaxies with @xmath104 , so we will use a cumulative completeness of 0.20 for this sample . then we should have roughly 20 galaxies with a mean sfr of 0.9  m@xmath16  yr@xmath12 .",
    "the fifth galaxy has @xmath105 and sfr=0.2  m@xmath16  yr@xmath12 .",
    "the cumulative completeness for red galaxies is 0.53 , and we do not apply a correction .",
    "thus , the completeness corrected total sfr is 18.2  m@xmath16  yr@xmath12 .",
    "we then apply an extinction correction corresponding to 1.8 magnitudes of extinction at [ oii ] .",

    "in fact , it may be that @xmath4 is a more accurate measure of cluster mass than the values derived from lensing analyses , in which case the fundamental correlation is between cluster sfr and cluster mass , with either no or weak evolution between @xmath5 .",
    "one possible complication is additional icm heating from agn , which may introduce some scatter in the expected t@xmath122m@xmath123 correlation for a virialized system .",
    "there is some evidence for a significant agn population in the @xmath124 cluster ms1054 @xcite , and cl0152 has two confirmed agn associated with the southern clump @xcite .",
    "let us briefly review what is qualitatively expected from hierarchical models .",
    "@xcite ( see fig .",
    "6 ) predict a trend of a rising sfr with redshift until @xmath125 , and a decline thereafter .",
    "more massive halos have larger sfrs at high redshift which rise more slowly , peak at higher redshift , and decline more sharply . around @xmath126",
    "the trend of sfr with halo mass has reversed , with lower mass halos having higher sfrs .",
    "there is also a prediction of a larger spread of integrated cluster sfrs with decreasing redshift for clusters that differ in mass , but an overall trend of decreasing cluster sfr with redshift .",
    "we do not find evidence for this in our data .",
    "we note that if cl0024 is excluded , then there is a tentative correlation of mass - normalized cluster sfr with redshift , however , this arises because in this sample more massive clusters are at lower redshift . also , `` normalizing '' the model halos by mass exaggerates the differences in cluster sfrs at these redshifts , and would not give such a correlation .",
    "testing such models must involve observations of many clusters at @xmath127 over a range of cluster masses to look for similarity at intermediate redshifts and strong diversity at low redshifts .",
    "the segregation of star - forming and passive galaxies in this cluster is striking . that no star - forming galaxies are found within the regions of high icm density points to a galaxy / icm interaction as the cause .",
    "there are two major contenders in the galaxy / icm interaction category : ram pressure stripping and starvation .",
    "the two are distinguished by the timescale over which they are expected to operate .",
    "ram pressure stripping affects the entire gas supply of a galaxy , disk and halo , whereas starvation only concerns the more loosely bound halo of gas , commonly termed the reservoir , which if left undisturbed , will settle to the disk and participate in star formation .",
    "ram pressure stripping is expected to occur on timescales of a few tens of myr , and starvation @xmath128  gyr .    for a comparison with @xcite",
    ", we estimate , using standard assumptions , the radius at which ram pressure stripping becomes important for a typical infalling spiral galaxy into the _",
    "southern cluster_. we assume a smooth icm and a density profile of the form    @xmath129^{(-3/2)\\beta } \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we use the virial radius @xmath130  mpc , the gas mass within the virial radius @xmath131  m@xmath16 , the core radius , @xmath132=@xmath133  kpc , and @xmath134 @xcite . to find @xmath135m@xmath16  mpc@xmath136 .",
    "following @xcite , we write the condition for ram pressure stripping as    @xmath137    where @xmath138 is in m@xmath16  mpc@xmath136 , @xmath139 is in km  s@xmath12 , and @xmath140 is in @xmath141 .    with these parameters ,",
    "the stripping radius for a milky way - type galaxy moving at a velocity of 1000  km  s@xmath12 relative to the icm is @xmath142  mpc .",
    "the closest projected star - forming galaxies to the southern clusters are @xmath143  mpc .",
    "although this is a crude estimate , the segregation of star - forming and non - star - forming galaxies in cl@xmath13 is consistent with an icm interaction as the dominant mechanism . the crucial distinguishing observation is the time for star formation to be extinguished , which we can not make here .",
    "each of the red sequence spirals has evidence for a central stellar concentration above an exponential disk , which we will refer to as a bulge .",
    "this contrasts with the blue late - type star - forming galaxies , about half of which show no evidence for a bulge .",
    "their red colors can not be due solely to dust , as they appear smooth while the blue spirals have patchy appearances , a clear indication of a larger amount of dust extinction .",
    "the fact that these red spirals are in the red cluster sequence means that the bulk of their stellar population was formed at a similar redshift as the ellipticals that make up the majority of the rcs in this cluster .",
    "given their red color , the presence of a bulge , and their relatively low star formation rates , it is probable that these red sequence spirals will become s0s .",
    "the compact early - type galaxies have rest - frame @xmath144 values from @xmath145 to @xmath146 .",
    "a minimum fading of @xmath147 magnitudes from @xmath73 to 0 is expected assuming a single burst population with an age of 3  gyr at @xmath73 .",
    "adding even a 1% burst with an age of 10  myr increases the fading to @xmath148 magnitudes , and a burst of 10% to @xmath149 magnitudes .",
    "we therefore expect these galaxies to fade to m@xmath150 to @xmath151 .",
    "this is consistent with an identification as progenitors of dwarf elliptical galaxies that are populous in present day clusters @xcite .",
    "these compact early - type galaxies may also be related to `` harassed '' low surface brightness disk galaxies .",
    "the simulations of @xcite explore the effects of galaxy harassment on high and low surface brightness ( lsb ) disk galaxies , and indicate that the outcome is significantly different for the two types of objects .",
    "lsb galaxies lose between @xmath152% of their stars , and remnants are well - fitted by exponential disks with scale - lengths between @xmath153  kpc , which is consistent with the scale - lengths of the compact early - type galaxies discovered in cl0152 . to match the absolute @xmath72 magnitudes of these compact galaxies , infalling field",
    "lsb disk galaxies would have to have absolute b magnitudes of @xmath154 to @xmath155 before the effects of harassment , assuming the young and old stellar populations are equally stripped .",
    "we also note a possible connection to the  missing  faint red galaxy population in the luminosity functions of intermediate redshift clusters @xcite .",
    "perhaps the faint red population is still forming at @xmath156 , and the descendants of these star - forming compact galaxies will make up the missing faint red galaxies .",
    "we have identified a population of star - forming galaxies in the cluster cl0152 - 1357 at @xmath0 @xcite , and we investigate their morphologies , colors , and spatial distribution .",
    "we derive star - formation rates from [ oii ] fluxes , and use these to compare the integrated sfr within @xmath81 with other clusters between @xmath5 .",
    "our conclusions are as follows .    * the 24 star - forming galaxies with acs morphological information range from compact early - types to spirals , with only one highly disturbed galaxy .",
    "the colors of the star - forming galaxies range from blue to red , and 8 out of 24 have @xmath1 colors placing them on the red cluster sequence .",
    "we find that the fraction of red cluster sequence galaxies with [ oii ] emission is likely to be @xmath65 .",
    "six of these galaxies have obvious spiral morphologies , and presuming an absence of major mergers , will most likely evolve into red sequence s0s .",
    "thus , @xmath157% of red cluster sequence s0s in massive clusters at z=0 are still forming stars at a low level at @xmath73 .",
    "however , their overall red colors indicate that they formed most of their stars during the epoch of massive cluster ellipticals . *",
    "we find no massive early - type galaxies with [ oii ] emission lines down to a 12     observed limit , corresponding to approximately 7     rest - frame ew .",
    "all galaxies with [ oii ] are spiral , irregular , or compact , low - to - intermediate mass early - type galaxies .",
    "these compact early - type galaxies have rest - frame @xmath72 magnitudes of @xmath145 to @xmath146 . assuming a moderate amount of @xmath158 magnitudes of @xmath72-band fading , this overlaps with present - day dwarf elliptical magnitudes , and we identify them as possible dwarf elliptical progenitors .",
    "we also note that these may be the  missing  faint red galaxy population in intermediate redshift clusters @xcite . *",
    "we find a paucity of star - forming galaxies within @xmath68  kpc of the projected cluster center , and none within the main x - ray peaks .",
    "using simple , standard assumptions about the density profile of the icm , this radius is consistent with the expected effect of ram pressure stripping .",
    "* we measure the integrated star formation rate within @xmath81 for cl0152 - 1357 , and find a value similar to that of the @xmath156 cluster cl0023 + 0423 , although these clusters differ by at a least a factor of 2 in mass .",
    "we find an inverse correlation of the mass - normalized integrated star formation rate and @xmath4 , and no trend with redshift .",
    "however , a larger cluster sample is needed to reach a definitive conclusion , and additional data on clusters with low x - ray temperatures will be pivotal .",
