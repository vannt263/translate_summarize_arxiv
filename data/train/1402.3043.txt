    "understanding frictional interaction is crucial for studying complex mechanical systems .",
    "but it is challenging to gain more insights on friction by studying complex natural ( tectonic plates , human joints , etc . ) or engineering ( gears , bearings , seals , etc . )",
    "thus , experimental research focuses on simplified systems with known properties and measurable behaviour .",
    "a wide range of experiments has been conducted on flat interfaces of a given pair of materials in order to analyse the fundamentals of friction  @xcite .",
    "these experiments revealed and analysed several phenomena : different propagation speeds of interface ruptures ( from slow to super - shear )  @xcite , crack - like or pulse - like rupture  @xcite , and precursor slip events occurring before global sliding  @xcite .",
    "even though such experimental research gives additional opportunities to study phenomena occurring on more complex systems , they bear challenges as well . accessing information at the interface ,",
    "where an important part of the studied mechanisms happens , is difficult because the interface is hidden behind the bulk material .",
    "experimental research often needs to rely on few measurement points distant from the interface , on transparent materials , and on a limited number of experiments .",
    "therefore , numerical simulations are needed to confirm or complement the analysis of these mechanisms . modelling local slip events at frictional interfaces between dissimilar materials ( bi - material interfaces ) using mass - spring models  @xcite or the finite - element method  @xcite have shown many similarities with the experiments . however , these numerical models have an inherent problem as explained hereafter .    it was shown  @xcite that dynamic sliding of bi - material interfaces under coulomb s friction law is in many cases unstable , which results in an unbounded increase of displacement oscillations in response to small perturbations at the interface . in real experiments such behaviour has never been observed . for the particular case of deformable - rigid interfaces ,",
    "the stability of coulomb friction was first studied analytically by  @xcite , and  @xcite .",
    "they showed that sliding of a linear elastic solid on a rigid surface is ill - posed if both the static and kinetic coefficients of friction are greater than one and equal .",
    "moreover , if velocity weakening friction is applied , ill - posedness occurs for smaller friction coefficient as well .    in numerical simulations the instability due to the bi - material effect results in a lack of mesh convergence  @xcite .",
    "therefore , most simulations of local slip events need some regularisation to solve this stability problem .",
    "two strategies are known : either the regularisation is applied onto the bulk ( _ e.g. _ , rayleigh damping or visco - elastic constitutive material ) or at the interface ( _ e.g. _ , friction regularisation ) . in any case , however , it influences the dynamics of local slip events and thus raises questions about the interpretation of numerical results .",
    "the solution of interface regularisation is found in the results of experimental work by  @xcite .",
    "they show that the frictional resistance does not change instantaneously to a sudden jump of the normal force , but evolves continuously with time .",
    "this observation opposes the coulomb friction law @xmath0 , where the friction force @xmath1 is proportional to the normal force @xmath2 with the coefficient of friction @xmath3 .",
    "recently , @xcite confirmed on a different experimental setup that there is no direct effect on the frictional strength due to a jump in the normal force . a friction law based on these observations introduces a length scale to the definition of the friction force .",
    "it was shown that the use of a simplified version of such friction laws renders the bi - material friction problem well - posed and allows to reach mesh convergence  @xcite .",
    "this regularisation of friction has since been used widely for earthquake simulations  @xcite .    in purpose of avoiding damping in the bulk ,",
    "we assume here that friction is governed by the prakash - clifton law and focus our attention on its effect on the mechanics of slip at frictional interfaces",
    ". the parameters of this friction regularisation have important implications on the local as well as the global behaviour of friction  @xcite , and need therefore to be chosen wisely in order to get meaningful numerical results . however , the choice of appropriate parameters is difficult due to the absence of experimental data for most materials . furthermore , the characteristic length scale deduced from the experiments of  @xcite is of the order of micrometres  @xcite , which requires very fine discretization and heavy computational efforts .    in this work",
    ", we study the rupture of interfaces between deformable and rigid solids governed by a regularised friction law .",
    "equal static and kinetic friction coefficients that are smaller than one ensure a well - posed problem even without regularisation  @xcite .",
    "choosing a slip event that is well - posed with and without a friction regularisation avoids a possible distortion of the analysis of the mechanics of regularised friction due to the transition from an ill - posed to a well - posed problem . in section  [ sec : influence ] , we confirm that mesh - converged solutions are achieved without numerical damping in the bulk for sliding with regularised friction at a deformable - rigid interface .",
    "we then depict a convergence map with respect to the characteristic length of the friction regularisation and the discretization of the interface . using mesh - converged solutions ,",
    "we show that the friction regularisation has for a given slip event a converging behaviour with respect to the characteristic length of the regularisation .",
    "the behaviour of a slip event is the same for every characteristic length below the critical length .",
    "these observations are confirmed and explained in section  [ sec : filter ] by the high - frequency - filter effect of the prakash - clifton friction law .",
    "the implications of the converging regularisation are analysed in section  [ sec : interpretation ] showing that there is a domain of influence for the prakash - clifton friction regularisation linked with the characteristic length of the regularisation and the spectral content of the slip event . outside this domain of influence ,",
    "the propagation of a slip event under regularised friction is equivalent to the propagation under coulomb s friction law .",
    "we study the propagation of a rupture at a frictional interface between a semi - infinite isotropic elastic half - space and a rigid flat surface ( figure  [ fig : setup ] ) .",
    "this two - dimensional plane strain geometry as well as the material properties are similar to the systems studied by  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we impose in @xmath4 direction periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) with replication length @xmath5 .",
    "the height @xmath6 ensures that no reflected elastic wave reaches the interface within the time of rupture propagation and does not influence the results of the simulations .",
    "the deformable solid is subjected to a remote compressive normal load @xmath7 and a remote shear load @xmath8 .",
    "the material properties of the elastic solid are density @xmath9 , young s modulus @xmath10 , and poisson s ratio @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting elastic wave speeds for p ( longitudinal ) and s ( transversal ) waves are @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "friction at the interface is governed by coulomb s law with equal static and kinetic coefficient of friction @xmath14 , and is regularised by a simplified  @xcite law as proposed by  @xcite @xmath15 ~ , \\label{eq : pc_law}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the effective frictional strength , @xmath17 is coulomb friction , @xmath18 is the slip velocity , @xmath19 is a ( positive ) reference velocity , and @xmath20 is the characteristic length of the regularisation .",
    "the combination of friction parameters , material properties and imposed loading conditions induces a uniform shear traction at the interface that is at @xmath21 of the frictional strength ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "this value enables the propagation of an interface rupture nucleated by an artificial change of normal contact pressure , as it was done in previous studies  @xcite . seeking to make this article",
    "self - contained , we describe the nucleation procedure in  [ sec : nucleation ] as it was already presented in  @xcite .",
    "this spatial - temporal nucleation region is of elliptic shape in the @xmath23 plane with @xmath24 and @xmath25 being half the ellipse s minor and major axis , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 inclines the elliptic shape of the nucleation region in the @xmath23 , which ensures that the propagation of the interface rupture is oriented in the positive direction of @xmath4 ( _ i.e. _ , the maximum of the artificial change of contact pressure propagates roughly at velocity @xmath26 in the @xmath4 direction ) .",
    "the parameter choice for this study is @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "in contrast to previous work , our simulation tool allows for interface opening . in order to avoid such opening and to be consistent with previous studies , we decrease the contact pressure by at most @xmath30 of its initial value .",
    "the model is based on the finite - element method with an explicit newmark-@xmath31 integration scheme and a lumped mass matrix .",
    "the deformable solid is discretized by regular quadrilateral elements with linear interpolation and four integration points .",
    "the mesh is characterised by the node density @xmath32 at the interface , which ranges in the present study from @xmath33 to @xmath34 nodes per meter ( nd / m ) .",
    "the mesh density is homogeneous in the entire solid in order to avoid spurious wave reflections due to a gradient of mesh density .",
    "a typical result of a nucleated interface rupture is shown in figure  [ fig : example ] .",
    "the contact pressure reduction , which triggers the slip event , is located close to the origin . from this point",
    "the rupture propagates in the positive direction of @xmath4 .",
    "the maximal slip velocity is @xmath35 in the beginning and decreases continuously until the rupture stops at @xmath36 .",
    "the dark line adjacent to the grey area in figure  [ fig : example](a ) indicates space and time when the slip velocity starts to be non - zero , which we call hereinafter the _ slip front_. the light area between this dark line and the dark parts of the grey area shows that the maximal slip velocity does not occur at the front of the interface rupture , which is also notable in figure  [ fig : example](b ) .",
    "however , the time between the slip front and the maximum of the slip velocity generally reduces with increasing propagation distance .     and @xmath37 ; and interface mesh density @xmath38 .",
    "( a ) slip velocity @xmath18 is shown in the spatial - temporal @xmath23 plane as grey area , where darker colours correspond to higher slip velocities .",
    "vertical lines in ( a ) indicate positions for which in ( b ) the evolution of @xmath18 is shown over time .",

    "the rupture propagates with super - shear velocity , @xmath40 , during almost its entire propagation .",
    "it decelerates fast only shortly before the arrest of slip .",
    "even though the slip front in the @xmath23 plane seems to be straight , the rupture speed slows down continuously except for a short distance at @xmath41 , where it remains quasi constant .",
    "the decreasing rupture speed along @xmath42 is the transition phase before the rupture enters a steady state , which lasts in this simulation for approximately @xmath43 until the phase of arrest starts .",
    "other simulations with different regularisation parameters present steady state phases that may span over almost the entire propagation distance .    in the next section",
    ", the slip velocity @xmath18 as well as the rupture speed @xmath39 are analysed for different mesh densities and different values of friction regularisation parameters .",
    "we show that the interface ruptures simulated with regularised friction do not only converge with respect to the mesh , but also with respect to the characteristic length of the regularisation .",
    "the simplified prakash - clifton friction regularisation , eq .  [ eq : pc_law ] , as proposed by  @xcite , has two parameters , @xmath20 and @xmath19 , and depends on the slip velocity @xmath18 . in order to simplify the analysis of this regularisation in the present study , we fix @xmath44 and consider the variation of the characteristic length @xmath20 .",
    "different values for @xmath19 result in equivalent observations and conclusions .",
    "this simplification leads to a regularisation that still depends on the slip velocity .",
    "other approaches were applied in previous studies  @xcite , where the @xmath45 term was replaced by @xmath46 .",
    "the resulting one - parameter regularisation is similar to our simplification but without dependence on slip velocity .    before studying the influence of the friction regularisation on the propagation of interface ruptures , we first confirm the mesh - converging quality of the system under consideration and determine a convergence map with respect to the characteristic length @xmath20",
    "this map enables the choice of an appropriate mesh density for a given @xmath20 in order to study the effects of the friction regularisation on mesh - converged simulations .",
    "the mesh refinement analysis is conducted on meshes with interface node densities @xmath32 ranging from @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "the slip velocity and rupture speed for @xmath49 and different meshes are shown in figure  [ fig : mesh_conv ] , where the colour intensity is chosen accordingly to the mesh density with dark colours being finer meshes .",
    "high - frequency oscillations with important amplitudes are present in simulations with coarse meshes . by refining the mesh , the dominant oscillations increase in frequency and decrease in amplitude .",
    "mesh convergence is achieved when by refining the discretization the relative error over the slip event s total propagation distance is below @xmath50 . in addition",
    ", we measure the arrival time at @xmath51 . the relative error of this time due to the last mesh refinement is below @xmath52 for the case presented in figure  [ fig : mesh_conv ] .     and @xmath44 .",

    "the difference can be distinguished only in the arrest - phase , where for the finer mesh the rupture speed decreases significantly faster .",
    "a coarser ( non - converged ) mesh causes the interface rupture to propagate farther and faster during the arrest phase than the converged solution .",
    "compared with the results obtained for @xmath54 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] ) , the rupture speed for this slip event , with @xmath55 , is more steady before arresting and does not present an important decelerating phase before the steady propagation .",
    "the mesh converging behaviour of this interface rupture is summarised in figure  [ fig : mesh_conv](c ) .",
    "the filled circles indicate the characteristic length and the node densities of the simulations for which slip velocities and rupture speeds are presented in figure  [ fig : mesh_conv](a - b ) .",
    "similar analysis were conducted with different values of @xmath20 .",
    "the corresponding node densities at the limit of mesh convergence are indicated with triangles .",
    "simulations with @xmath56 present no interface rupture anymore due to the strong regularisation , which prevents initiation of slip for the considered triggering .",
    "the solid area marks the zone of mesh - converged solutions , whereas the hatched area shows the zone of non - converged simulations .",
    "the limit of mesh - convergence is located in the white area between the two marked zones .",
    "the convergence map demonstrates that simulations with smaller characteristic lengths of the friction regularisation need finer meshes for mesh - converged solutions .",
    "this observation , which was already noticed without illustration by  @xcite , is here confirmed and visualised .    a main observation in figure  [ fig : mesh_conv](a ) is that the mesh refinement changes the frequency of the perturbing oscillations .",
    "the origin of these oscillations lies in the non - smoothness of the slip velocity in the transition from stick to slip , which excites all ranges of frequencies of the system .",
    "a finite discretized solid , however , has only a limited and discrete set of eigenfrequencies .",
    "therefore , the energy in the spectral space above the highest representable frequency of the discretization seems to be lumped at this maximal eigenfrequency of the mesh , which is also in the range of the perturbing oscillations . because smaller elements enable the representation of shorter wavelengths , mesh refinement causes higher frequencies of the oscillations .",
    "the presence of high - frequency noise is common in this kind of simulations and it is often eliminated by numerical damping in the bulk . here",
    ", we have shown that simulations with regularised friction converge without any bulk damping , which is a necessary condition in order to be able to study the influence of the friction regularisation on the propagation of interface ruptures .",
    "it is interesting to note that this ( damping like ) stabilising effect of regularised friction on numerical problems has already been exploited in recent studies on well - posed problems ( _ e.g. _ , frictional interfaces between similar materials )  @xcite .",
    "we now study the influence of the regularisation s length scale @xmath20 on the slip velocity and rupture speed ( see figure  [ fig : l_conv ] ) , similarly as in the mesh convergence analysis .",
    "the applied meshes are chosen based on the convergence map , as presented in the previous section , at the limit of mesh convergence .",
    "the value of the friction regularisation strongly affects both the slip velocity and the rupture speed , see fig .",
    "[ fig : l_conv](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the simulation with the largest characteristic length @xmath20 ( in lightest colour ) is the most salient with a considerably smaller slip velocity at @xmath57 .",
    "further , the slip front reaches @xmath57 later than the other simulations despite higher rupture speeds until this position . at a first glance",
    "this seems to be incoherent .",
    "however , the strong regularisation delays the initiation of the interface rupture , which explains why the slip front is behind the rupture tip of the other simulation despite its higher propagation speed .",
    "the interface rupture with the second and third largest characteristic lengths ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) have a similar behaviour",
    ". both have at @xmath57 a maximal slip velocity of around @xmath60 and reach the point at around @xmath61 .",
    "both slip events also present a rupture speed that decelerates from @xmath62 to @xmath63 along almost the complete propagation distance until they arrest abruptly .",
    "similar to the example shown in figure  [ fig : example ] , these interface ruptures do not have a phase of steady propagation .    .",

    ", the critical length is estimated as @xmath68 .",
    "this convergence of the interface rupture with respect to the friction regularisation has not been observed before .",
    "we analyse the effect of regularised friction on the spectrum of the slip event in the next section .",
    "in section  [ sec : influence ] , we observed that the regularisation affects differently the oscillations of various frequencies in the slip velocity @xmath69 .",
    "these oscillations are closely related to coupled oscillations of the frictional and normal forces .",

    "further , the simulation with the smallest characteristic length , which is converged with respect to @xmath20 , has a sharp peak at @xmath70 .",
    "this feature is related to the fast transition from stick to slip , which is at the origin of the perturbing high frequency oscillations .",

    "the explanation for this absence of criterion lies in the low range of frequencies .",
    "although the highest frequencies of even coarser meshes seem to be attenuated sufficiently , these frequencies are needed in order to describe accurately the evolution of the frictional strength as shown in figure  [ fig : frequency](a ) . therefore , convergence can not be achieved with meshes of node densities smaller than @xmath88 for this particular interface rupture because all needed frequencies are not present with coarser meshes .",
    "the same argument is valid as explanation of the other convergence : the convergence with respect to the characteristic length @xmath20 of the prakash - clifton friction law .",

    "the intersection of physical and critical lengths defines the critical frequency @xmath103 , which separates the slip event s frequencies that propagate under prakash - clifton s regularisation ( @xmath110 ) and that is governed by coulomb friction ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "fitting the prakash - clifton law to the friction and contact forces of a particular slip event with highest non - negligible frequency @xmath82 results in the measured length scale @xmath112 . if @xmath113 , the measured length scale is the physical property of the interface , whereas if @xmath114 , the measured length is the critical length , which is higher than @xmath101.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    from a numerical point of view , the critical length scale @xmath65 gives in many cases the opportunity of introducing the prakash - clifton regularisation in order to solve the issue of perturbing numerical oscillations without influencing the dynamics of the frictional interface rupture .",
    "any regularisation with a characteristic length smaller than the critical length does not affect the propagation of the slip event and the observable behaviour corresponds to the propagation under coulomb s friction law .",
    "in addition to the effect of removing nuisance oscillations , using the critical characteristic length in numerical simulations minimises the computational efforts because smaller characteristic lengths require finer discretizations .",
    "for instance , if the physical length @xmath101 is smaller than the critical length @xmath65 , numerical simulations can be carried out using @xmath65 instead of @xmath101 without losing the physical bases of the results . on the other hand , simulations of interface ruptures for which the spectral content above the critical frequency @xmath115 is important ,",
    "does not provide any flexibility in the choice of the regularisation parameters .",
    "the characteristic length has to be exactly equal to the physical length @xmath116 in order to obtain a correct simulation of the physical behaviour .",
    "we studied the simplified prakash - clifton friction law , which regularises coulomb s friction with respect to sudden changes in contact pressure . as a test problem we considered the rupture of a planar frictional interface between an elastic solid and a rigid plane .",
    "the rupture was triggered artificially such that the slip front propagates in the direction of the movement of the elastic solid and stops after a while .",
    "different stages of the propagation were observed : primary ( a transition right after the initiation ) , steady ( the front velocity is almost constant ) , arresting ( the front decelerates and stops ) .",
    "we first confirmed that mesh - converged solutions are achievable in the stable regime ( for friction coefficients smaller than one ) of the considered problem without any numerical damping in the bulk .",
    "we delimited a mesh - convergence map with respect to the characteristic length @xmath20 of the prakash - clifton friction law .",
    "this map confirmed that mesh - converged solutions for smaller lengths need finer mesh discretizations .",
    "in addition to mesh convergence , we discovered a convergence of the solution with respect to the characteristic length @xmath20 .",
    "this observation results from the analysis of mesh - converged solutions for different characteristic lengths . considering a given slip event , a critical characteristic length @xmath65 exists , such that for any @xmath117 the propagation behaviour of the interface rupture is the same . to confirm and explain this observation , we analysed the regularisation s effect on a range of temporal frequencies of the frictional strength .",
    "the damping of low frequencies , which are the essential part of the slip event , becomes vanishingly small for small characteristic lengths and influences no longer the propagation of the interface rupture .",
    "this insight enables the definition of a theoretical domain @xmath118 of influence of the prakash - clifton friction law with respect to the characteristic length of the regularisation and the frequency content of the slip event .",
    "outside of this domain @xmath98 , the damping of the slip event s frequencies becomes negligible and the interface rupture propagates as if it was governed by coulomb s friction law despite the presence of the regularisation .    in conclusion ,",
    "the presented results suggest that the experimental determination of the physical length scale @xmath101 of the prakash - clifton friction law requires the temporal power spectrum density of the analysed slip event to contain enough energy in the high - frequency domain .",
    "we therefore propose an evaluation procedure that includes a verification of the slip event s frequency content .",
    "this is crucial to a successful determination of @xmath101 , because if the propagation of slip is fully determined by frequencies below a critical value , the real physical length scale @xmath101 of the prakash - clifton friction can not be measured .",
    "the observed length scale instead corresponds to the critical length @xmath65 , which may be significantly higher .",
