    "the aims of this paper are two - fold .",
    "first , we are interested in the statistical properties of magnetic fields advected by turbulent velocity fields .",
    "such magnetic fields possess a  self - stretching \" term that is absent in the context of advected passive scalars ( for a general introduction see @xcite ) .",
    "thus a dynamo effect may exist , and its relation to intermittency and anomalous scaling needs to be addressed .",
    "secondly , we want to focus on the anisotropic nature of turbulence : generically turbulence is forced by agents that are neither isotropic nor homogeneous , but most of the fundamental theories regarding universal scaling properties consider an ideal model of isotropic turbulence . in the case of a magnetic field advected by a gaussian , @xmath0-correlated velocity field with nontrivial spatial scaling we can present an exact ( nonperturbative ) solution of the full spectrum of anomalous scaling exponents of all the anisotropic contributions to the covariance of the magnetic field . we can thus offer a precise picture of the rate of isotropization upon diminishing scales , assess the importance of anisotropy for  inertial range \" scaling , etc .",
    "the equation of motion of a magnetic field @xmath2 reads @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the advecting velocity field , and @xmath5 is the external forcing , and @xmath6 is the magnetic diffusivity .",
    "we address a model in which the velocity is taken gaussian , isotropic , @xmath0-correlated in time , and its correlation function is @xmath7 \\ . \\label{eqmot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the structure function @xmath8 scales with exponent @xmath1 , @xmath9 : @xmath10 \\ , \\quad \\lambda \\ll r \\ll \\lambda \\ .\\ ] ] on the other hand the forcing @xmath5 is taken here gaussian , @xmath0-correlated in time but _ non - isotropic_. the correlation function of the forcing has compact support in @xmath11-space in an interval @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the outer scale of the forcing @xmath5 .",
    "we denote @xmath14 .",
    "we are interested in the properties of the covariance of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and eventually in the stationary quantity @xmath18 which is obtained in the stationary state if the forcing is balanced by dissipation .",
    "the calculation of this object in an _ isotropic _ ensemble has been presented by vergassola @xcite .",
    "the anisotropic problem has been addressed recently by lanotte and mazzino @xcite . in the latter study the covariance ( [ c ] )",
    "was not properly expanded in terms of irreducible representation of the so(3 ) symmetry group , and therefore an apparent mixing of the different sectors was found . as a result",
    "the authors had to tackle an infinite set of equations for all the sectors of the symmetry group .",
    "we show below that this mix - up is spurious , originating from an improper expansion .",
    "due to the improper choice of the expanding basis set , an infinite linear coupling between all sectors appeared in @xcite . in order to solve the infinite linear system",
    "the authors were forced to assume the existence of a hierarchy between exponents belonging to different sectors and then only a posteriori to check the correctness of their assumption . in this way",
    "the calculation ends up with one correct set of exponents , as is shown below by using the proper expansion .",
    "we compute additional exponents that were left out in @xcite .",
    "we will also concern ourselves with the issues of the dynamo effect and the attainment of a stationary solution for ( [ c ] ) .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in sect.2 , after presenting the equations of motion of the covariance , we expand the solutions in terms of basis functions of the so(3 ) symmetry group . in sect .",
    "3 the above expansion is used to obtain the matrix representation of the linear operator which determines the dynamics of the covariance . in sect .",
    "4 we use this matrix representation to show the absence of a dynamo effect in the anisotropic sectors of the covariance . sect . 5",
    "is devoted to the calculation of the anomalous scaling exponents in the anisotropic sectors , and sect .",
    "6 offers a summary and a discussion .",
    "the equation of motion of the covariance were derived by the authors of @xcite with the final result @xmath19 \\nonumber\\\\ & + & ( \\partial_\\mu \\partial_\\nu s^{\\alpha\\beta } ) c^{\\mu\\nu } +      2\\kappa\\nabla^2 c^{\\alpha\\beta } +      f^{\\alpha\\beta } \\nonumber\\\\ & \\equiv&{\\hat t}^{\\alpha\\beta}_{~~\\sigma\\rho}c^{\\sigma\\rho } +      f^{\\alpha\\beta } \\ , \\label{eqc}\\\\ \\partial_\\alpha c^{\\alpha\\beta } & = & 0 \\ , \\label{solenoid}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last equation follows from the solenoidal condition for the magnetic field .",
    "it is advantageous to to decompose the covariance @xmath20 in terms of basis functions that block - diagonalize the angular part of the operator @xmath21 .",
    "these basis functions are implied by the symmetries of @xmath21 . since this operator contains only isotropic differential operators and contractions with either @xmath22 or @xmath23 , it is invariant to all rotations @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the natural basis functions should belong to irreducible representation of the so(3 ) symmetry group , and can be indexed by pairs of indices @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we are going to refer to solutions of ( [ eqc ] ) that belong to irreducible representation with a definite @xmath24 as the  @xmath24 sector \" .",
    "the operator @xmath21 leaves such sectors invariant .",
    "in addition , @xmath21 is invariant to the parity transformation @xmath27 , and to the index permutation @xmath28 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath21 can be further block - diagonalized into blocks with definite parity and symmetry under permutations .    in light of these consideration",
    "we seek solutions of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are tensor functions on the unit sphere , which belong to the sector @xmath24 of the so(3 ) symmetry group .",
    "the index @xmath32 enumerates different tensor functions belonging to the same sector . while for scalar functions on the sphere there exist only one spherical harmonic @xmath33 in each sector , the second rank tensor functions on the sphere there exist nine different tensors @xcite .",
    "the additional symmetries under parity and index permutation group them into four subgroups with four , two , two and one tensors respectively . with @xmath34 , in the notation of @xcite , the 4-group ( denoted below as subset i ) is : @xmath35 these are all symmetric in @xmath36 and have a parity of @xmath37 .",

    "the second has the same parity but is antisymmetric to @xmath36 exchange .",
    "the remaining basis function is @xmath41 which is antisymmetric to @xmath36 exchange , with parity @xmath37 .",
    "this will be denoted as subset iv . in @xcite",
    "it was proven that this basis is complete and indeed transforms under rotations as required for a @xmath24 sector .",
    "it should be noted that not all subsets contribute for every value of @xmath42 . due to the obvious symmetry of the covariance : @xmath43 it follows that representations symmetric to @xmath44 exchange must also have even parity , while antisymmetric representations must have odd parity .",
    "accordingly , even @xmath42 s are associated with subsets i and iii , and odd @xmath42 s are associated with subset ii .",
    "we show below that subset iv can not contribute to this theory due to the solenoidal constraint .",
    "having the angular basis functions we seek the representation of the operator @xmath21 in this basis .",
    "in such a representation @xmath21 is a differential operator with respect to @xmath46 only . in appendix",
    "a we demonstrate how @xmath21 mixes basis functions within a given subset , but not between the subsets - as is expected in the last section . in finding the matrix representation of @xmath21",
    "we are aided by the incompressibility constraint .",
    "consider first subset i with 4 basis functions eqs.([group1 ] ) in a given @xmath24 sector . to simplify the notation we will redenote the coefficients according to @xmath47 , @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 . in this basis the operator @xmath21 takes on the form @xmath51 = \\b .",

    "appendix of @xcite ) : @xmath64",
    "lastly , there are no solutions belonging to the @xmath65 sector .",
    "this is due to the fact that such solutions correspond to subset ii . in this subset",
    "the @xmath65 solenoidal condition implies the equation @xmath66 or @xmath67 which is not an admissible solution .",
    "the first issue to clarify is the existence of a stationary solution for @xmath68 .",
    "a dynamo effect may cause the covariance to grow unboundedly .",
    "vergassola @xcite showed that this is not the case in the isotropic sector as long as @xmath69 .",
    "we demonstrate that the dynamo effect is absent also in the anisotropic sectors .",
    "consider the forceless case of eq.([eqc ] ) with @xmath70 .",
    "in addition assume initial conditions such that @xmath71 .",
    "it is easy to see that no mean magnetic field can appear in time .",

    "for example @xmath92 .",
    "the full matrix reads @xmath93 we note that @xmath90 is symmetric and positive definite . by integration by parts , using the fact that our covariances vanish for @xmath94 , we demonstrate in appendix c that eq.([neg ] ) is true .    one important conclusion of this calculation is the relative rate of decay of the various anisotropic contributions .",
    "we see that upon increasing @xmath42 the inner product ( [ neg ] ) becomes more negative .",
    "thus , any anisotropic initial conditions results in a rapid decay of the higher @xmath42 contributions . without anisotropic forcing",
    "the covariance of the magnetic field becomes isotropic in time .",
    "we will show below that also in the ( anisotropic ) stationary state maintained by anisotropic forcing , the covariance isotropizes on the smaller scales .",
    "the scaling exponents governing the @xmath95 dependence are also strictly increasing with increasing @xmath42 .",
    "thus invariably for small enough scales and for long times one restores local isotropy .",
    "in the absence of a dynamo effect , we can consider a stationary state of the system , maintained by the forcing term @xmath96 .",
    "the covariance in such a case will bey the following equation : @xmath97 deep in the inertial range we look for scale invariant solutions , obtained as zero - modes of eq.([eqt ] ) . indeed , when @xmath98 and well within the inertial range we can take the magnetic dissipation to zero , and as a result , the homogeneous part of eq.([eqt ] ) ( without @xmath99 ) will be scale invariant , leading to scale invariant solutions .",
    "we will need to match these zero modes to the appropriate zero modes computed in the dissipative range at the end .",

    "consider the zero - mode equation deep inside the dissipative regime . here",
    "the dissipation terms become dominant and we can neglect all other terms in @xmath100 .",
    "the zero mode equation in this regime becomes a simple laplace equation : @xmath111 notice however , that up to an overall factor of @xmath112 , this equation is identical to the zero - mode equation for the special case @xmath74 .",
    "accordingly , the solutions @xmath101 are scale invariant with the exponents @xmath113 . using this we can immediately distinguish between the physical and unphysical solutions : at @xmath114 the covariance must be finite , and therefore only the positive exponents in ( [ exponents - i ] ) are acceptable .",
    "let us now consider the zero mode equation for @xmath74 . in this particular case , the equation is @xmath115 throughout the whole range , and so the zero modes do not change their functional form as we move from the dissipative regime to the inertial regime .",
    "therefore for , @xmath74 , also in the inertial regime , only the positive exponents are legitimate .",
    "assuming now that the solution ( including the exponents ) are continuous in @xmath1 , ( and not necessarily analytic ! ) , we immediately get , that also for finite @xmath1 , only the positive exponents appear in the inertial range . finally there",
    "exist two branches of solutions corresponding to the ( - ) and ( + ) in the square root .",
    "@xmath116 these exponents are in agreement with @xcite .",
    "note that in the case of @xmath117 only @xmath118 exists since the other exponent is not admissible , being negative for @xmath119 , and therefore excluded by continuity . for",
    "@xmath120 both solutions are admissible , and the leading one is the negative exponent which is smaller .",
    "in addition to these one needs to compute the exponents corresponding to the subsets ii and iii .",
    "the computation in the other two blocks follows the same lines .",
    "since these are 2@xmath862 they furnish two solutions for the exponents , one of which is negative .",
    "we end up finding @xmath121 @xmath122 for @xmath117 there is no contribution from this subset , as the exponent is negative .",
    "the dependence of the admissible leading exponents on @xmath1 is displayed in fig.1 and fig.2 . in table 1",
    "we summarize which are the leading exponents in each sector .",
    "in addition to matching the zero modes to the dissipative range , one has to guarantee matching at the outer scale @xmath13 .",
    "the condition to be fulfilled is that the sum of the zero - modes with the inhomogeneous solutions ( whose exponents are 2-@xmath1 ) must give @xmath123 as @xmath124 .",
    "obviously this means that the forcing must have a projection on any sector @xmath91 for which @xmath125 is nonzero .",
    "the results of this paper should be examined in light of the recent progress in understanding the effects of anisotropy on the statistics of fully developed turbulence @xcite . whereas in the navier - stokes case one can not present exact results , the present study can affords exact calculations of the whole spectrum of scaling exponents that determines the covariance of a vector field in the presence of anisotropy .",
    "we have presented a detailed and systematic investigation of scaling properties of the covariance of a magnetic field advected by a gaussian and delta - correlated in time velocity field .",
    "we have extended the non - perturbative analysis presented by vergassola in @xcite for the isotropic sector to all the sectors of the so(3 ) symmetry group .",
    "our analysis leads to the conclusions that the scaling exponents are strictly increasing with the index of @xmath42 of the sector , meaning that there is a tendency toward isotropization upon decreasing the scales of observation .",
    "we also showed that as far as the dynamo problem is concerned , anisotropic sectors are less unstable than the isotropic sector : in the absence of an external forcing anisotropies decay in time faster then isotropic fluctuations . in distinction with the expansion presented in @xcite , our results are free of any assumptions about the hierarchy of scaling exponents belonging to different so(3 ) sectors .",
    "this is due to the employment of a proper basis set .",
    "the equations for the magnetic covariance foliate into independent closed equations for each set of irreducible representations of the so(3 ) group .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that the covariance of the magnetic field is naturally computed as a sum of contributions proportional to the irreducible representations of the so(3 ) symmetry group .",
    "the amplitudes are non - universal , determined by boundary conditions .",
    "the scaling exponents are universal , forming a discrete , strictly increasing spectrum indexed by the sectors of the symmetry group .",
    "similar results were presented for passive scalar fluctuations in @xcite , and for navier - stokes fluctuations in @xcite . in the present case",
    "anomalous scaling laws are found as the zero - modes of the inertial operator governing the stationary equation for the magnetic covariance @xcite .",
    "matching with the uv boundary conditions selects the physically acceptable solutions .",
    "it appears quite clear now that the issue of anomalous , universal scaling exponents in turbulence has ramified to the multitude of sectors of the appropriate symmetry groups .",
