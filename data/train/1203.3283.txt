    "oxides such as manganites display a rich interplay of various orbital , charge , and spin orders when rare - earth dopants are added to the parent oxide .",
    "while significant progress has been made in characterizing the bulk doped materials , the heterostructures produced from two parent oxides is an area of active research @xcite .",
    "several novel phenomena , that have no counter part in the bulk samples , seem to emerge from the interface / heterostructure physics @xcite .",
    "in fact , the challenge is to technologically exploit this new physics and develop new useful devices that can meet future challenges such as miniaturization , dissipationless operation / manipulation ( such as read / write capability ) , energy storage , etc .",
    "there has been a revival in multiferroic research partly due to improved technology , discovery of new compounds ( such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) , need for devices with strong magnetoelectric effect , etc @xcite .",
    "majority of the multiferroics studied are bulk materials where it is not yet clear why the magnetic and electric polarizations coexist poorly @xcite . with the advent of improved molecular - beam - epitaxy technology",
    "one can now grow oxide heterostructures and explore the possibility of strong multiferroic phenomena as well as large interplay between ferroelectricity and magnetic polarization .",
    "there are numerous mechanisms for magnetoelectric effect reviews for which can be found in refs . .",
    "at the interface of a magnetic oxide and a ferroelectric / dielectric oxide , magnetoelectric effect of electronic origin has been predicted by some researchers . upon application of an external electric field , not only the magnitude of moments",
    "can be changed @xcite , but in some cases the very nature of magnetic ordering can be changed @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we predict a giant magnetoelectric effect , not at the interface , but away from it , in an oxide - oxide heterostructure ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . our objective is to present a plausible / possible unnoticed multiferroic phenomenon in manganite heterostructures and point out the associated large / striking magnetoelectric effect .",
    "jahn - teller electron - phonon interaction is shown to be key to understanding both multiferroicity and magnetoelectric effect in our oxide heterostructure . here",
    ", we exploit the fact that manganites have various competing phases that are close in energy and that by using an external perturbation ( such as an electric or a magnetic field ) the system can be induced to alter its phase .",
    "we show that there is a charge redistribution ( with a net electric dipole moment perpendicular to the interface ) and a concomitant ferromagnetism due to the optimization produced by the following two competing effects : ( i ) energy cost to produce holes on the @xmath1 ( lmo ) side and excess electrons on the @xmath2 ( smo ) side ; and ( ii ) energy gain due to electron - hole attraction ( or electron - electron repulsion ) on nearest - neighbor @xmath5-sites induced by electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the charge polarization is akin to that of a pn - junction in semiconductors although the governing equations are different .",
    "the key results of our analysis are : ( i ) the interface charge density at the lmo - smo interface is 0.5 electrons / site and the charge in the layers perpendicular to the interface rapidly attain the bulk value as one moves away from the interface due to the fact that the dielectric constant is not large ; ( ii ) the lmo - smo interface is ferromagnetic and persists to be ferromagnetic for a few layers adjacent to the interface on both sides of the interface ; ( iii ) furthermore , since ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism have a common origin [ i.e. , holes ( electrons ) on lmo ( smo ) side ] , there is a striking interplay between these two polarizations leading to a giant magnetoelectric effect .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce our phenomenological hamiltonian ( based on cooperative jahn - teller physics ) using which we deduce the charge distribution in sec .",
    "iii and establish the ferroelectric effect of our oxide - oxide heterostructure .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "iv we show how the charge profile across the interface produces magnetic phases ( much like the phase diagram of lsmo ) and show how the interface charge affects magnetism on both sides of it .",
    "we close in sec .",
    "v with our concluding observations .",
    "in our @xmath0 heterostructure depicted in fig . 1 , we expect to realize the entire phase diagram of @xmath6 starting with the @xmath7 phase at the insulator - lmo interface and sequentially evolving to the @xmath8 phase at the other end involving smo - insulator interface .",
    "since , majority of the lsmo phase diagram ( including the end regions near @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) is taken up by insulating phases , we expect that there is no effective transport in the direction normal to the oxide - oxide interface .",
    "furthermore , we will show that the calculated concentrations in any layer on both the lmo and smo sides turn out to be such that the bulk @xmath9 ( lsmo ) at this concentration is always in the insulating regime .",
    "thus , we consider a system of localized electrons : this is also in tune with the insulating behavior reported in @xmath10 superlattices @xcite .",
    "additionally , at strong electron - phonon coupling , one can see that band width is significantly diminished . other reasons for localization ,",
    "besides narrow band electrons being localized by disorder ( such as interface roughness ) , could be anti - ferromagnetic order on the smo side and cooperative lattice jahn - teller distortion on the lmo side .",
    "then , _ for analyzing the charge distribution normal to the interface _ , the starting hamiltonian is assumed to have the following phenomenological form : @xmath11 \\sum_{j,\\delta}n_j(1-n_{j+\\delta } ) , \\label{h_eff}\\ ] ] where the first coefficient @xmath12 is due to electron - phonon interaction and represents nearest - neighbor electron - electron repulsion brought about by incompatible distortions of nearest - neighbor oxygen cages surrounding occupied @xmath5 ions .",
    "the pre - factor @xmath13 can depend on the phase  for instance , in the c - type antiferromagnetic ( afm ) regime of lsmo , @xmath13 is expected to be large because occupancy of neighboring @xmath14 orbitals is inhibited in the z - direction ; while in the a - type afm regime ( corresponding to undoped @xmath1 ) , @xmath13 is expected to be weaker because of compatible jahn - teller distortions on neighboring sites . here",
    "we will assume for simplicity that @xmath13 is concentration independent and that @xmath15 .",
    "next , the coefficient @xmath16 results from processes involving hopping to nearest - neighbor and back and is present even when we consider the simpler holstein model @xcite or the hubbard - holstein model @xcite .",
    "the pre - factor @xmath17 varies between @xmath18 ( for non - cooperative electron - phonon interaction ) and @xmath19 ( since for cooperative breathing mode in one - dimensional chains @xmath20 , which should be more than in c - chains ) @xcite .",
    "now , since manganites are two - band systems , @xmath21 is an effective term which has contributions from hopping between various orbitals on neighboring sites and the polaronic energy associated with different orbital occupancy .",
    "furthermore , although @xmath22 is the total number in both orbitals on site @xmath23 , it can only take a maximum value of 1 due to strong on - site electron - electron repulsion and strong hund s coupling .",
    "next , to make the above hamiltonian furthermore relevant for manganites , one needs to consider hund s coupling between core spins and itinerant electrons .",
    "this leads to invoking the double exchange mechanism for transport .",
    "then , the hopping term @xmath24 between sites @xmath25 and @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ h_eff ] ) is modified to be @xmath26}$ ] .",
    "lastly , we ignored the effect of superexchange interaction in the starting effective hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ h_eff ] ) because its energy scale is significantly smaller that the polaronic energy term @xmath27 and thus its effect on charge distribution can be neglected .",
    "each of the labelled @xmath28 layers on both lmo and smo sides , as well as in the interface , comprise of manganese - oxide ( mo ) layers.,width=192,height=211 ]",
    "for a localized system , we only need to minimize the interaction energy which is a functional of the electronic density profile .",
    "the coulombic interaction energy resulting from the electrons leaking from the lmo side to the smo side , is taken into account by ascribing an effective charge @xmath29 ( hole ) to the lmo unit cell ( centered at the @xmath5 site ) that has donated an @xmath30 electron from the @xmath5 site and effective charge @xmath31 ( electron ) to the smo unit cell ( centered at the @xmath5 site ) that has accepted an @xmath30 electron at the @xmath5 site .",
    "the coulombic energy that results is due to interactions between these @xmath32 effective charges .",
    "the net positive charge on the lmo side and net negative charge on the smo side will produce a charge polarization ( or inversion asymmetry ) . since the ferroelectric dipole is expected to be in the direction perpendicular to the oxide - oxide ( lmo - smo ) interface , we assume that the density is uniform in each layer for calculating the density profile as a function of distance @xmath33 from the insulator - oxide interface .",
    "the coulombic interaction energy per unit area due to leaked charges is the same for both lmo and smo regions and is given , in the continuum approximation , to be @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the electric displacement and is given by @xmath36 , \\label{e_c}\\ ] ] with @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) sign for lmo ( smo ) side .",
    "furthermore , @xmath39 is the charge density , @xmath40 the charge of a hole , @xmath41 the dielectric constant , @xmath42 an external electric field along the z - direction , and @xmath43 the thickness of the lmo ( smo ) layers .",
    "the ground state energy per unit area [ corresponding to the effective hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ h_eff ] ) ] can be written , in the continuum approximation , as a functional of @xmath39 for both lmo and smo as follows : @xmath44 \\zeta\\int_0^{l } dz   \\rho(z ) [ 1- a^3   \\rho(z ) ] , \\label{e_pol}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the coordination number and @xmath46 is the lattice constant . in arriving at the above equation we have approximated @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , for the ground state , we expect @xmath26 } = t_{ij}$ ] , i.e. , minority charges completely polarize the neighboring majority charges",
    ".    we will now minimize the total energy given below @xmath48 by setting the functional derivative @xmath49 = 0 .",
    "this leads to the following equation @xmath50   + 2 c_2\\int_{z}^{l } dy \\left [ - { \\tilde{\\rm e}}_{ext } + \\int_0^y dx \\rho(x ) \\right ] ,    \\\\ \\label{e_opt}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 \\zeta$ ] ; @xmath52 ; and @xmath53 . the above equation , upon taking double derivative with respect to @xmath33 , yields @xmath54 the above second - order differential eq . ( [ rhoz_eq ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ e_opt ] ) admit the solution @xmath55}{\\cosh(ml ) } , \\label{rhoz}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 .",
    "it is important to note that for the manganese - oxide ( mo ) layer at the lmo - smo interface ( i.e. , at @xmath57 ) , the density is 0.5 electrons / site and that it is independent of the applied external electric field !",
    "furthermore , for realistic values of the parameters , the charge density rapidly changes as we move away from the oxide - oxide interface ( i.e. , after only a few layers from the interface ) and attains values close to the bulk value .",
    "lastly , as required for zero values of field @xmath42 , we get @xmath58 when @xmath59 . thus , although we used the continuum approximation , our obtained density profile is qualitatively realistic as it has the desired values at the extremes @xmath57 and @xmath60 with the density away from the lmo - smo interface rapidly falling for not too large values of @xmath41 .",
    "+ for our calculations we used the following values for the parameters : @xmath61  ; @xmath62 ; @xmath63 ; @xmath64 ; and @xmath65 .",
    "the density profiles for both lmo and smo sides depend only on @xmath41 , @xmath66 and @xmath42 .",
    "we observe from figs . 2 and 3 that for smaller values of @xmath66 , as distance from the interface increases , the density falls more rapidly while the density change due to electric field rises faster .",
    "we will now obtain the magnetization for a heterostructure by considering its lattice structure unlike the case for the density profile where a continuum approximation was made .",
    "thus we can take into account the possibility of antiferromagnetic order besides being able to consider ferromagnetic order .",
    "first , we observe that the bulk @xmath67 ( below the magnetic transition temperatures ) is a - type antiferromagnetic ( afm ) for @xmath68 ; ferromagnetic insulator ( fmi ) for @xmath69 ; and ferromagnetic ( fm ) metal for @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "hence , we model the lmo side of the heterostructure as a ferromagnet in regions with hole concentrations that are large but less than 0.5 with the magnetic structure abruptly switching to an a - type afm as the hole concentration values decrease to about 0.1 or less .",
    "next , we note that for @xmath71 , the lsmo bulk system is always an afm insulator with a - type afm for @xmath72 ; c - type afm for @xmath73 ; and g - type afm for @xmath74 . thus , from a magnetism point - of - view , the magnetic moment on the smo side of the heterostructure is expected to be zero except in the vicinity of the interface where ( due to proximity effect ) it will be fm and can be modeled using a percolating picture . given the above scenario , as can be expected , we find that the fm region on the lmo side can be drastically enhanced ( at the expense of the a - type afm region ) by an electric field inducing holes on the lmo side . on the hand ,",
    "the electric field has only a small effect on the percolating fm cluster that is adjacent to the oxide - oxide interface and is on the smo side .",
    "we will first consider the smo side and show that the magnetization decays as we move away from the lmo - smo interface .",
    "we derive the largest fm domain as follows . on account of nearest - neighbor repulsion ( as given in eq .",
    "( [ h_eff ] ) ) , the interface ( which is half - filled ) has @xmath30 electrons on alternate sites .",
    "in fact , to minimize the interaction energy , on the smo side we take the @xmath30 electrons to be in one sub - lattice only ( i.e. , they are in the same sub - lattice in each layer but on alternate sub - lattices on adjacent layers ) . on account of virtual hopping , an @xmath30 electron polarizes all its neighboring sites that do not contain any @xmath30 electrons .",
    "thus we observe that the half - filled interface will be fully polarized and that there will be a fm cluster that begins at the interface and percolates to the layers away from the interface on the smo side .",
    "for instance , in the layer next to the oxide - oxide interface , all the @xmath30 electrons are next to sites unoccupied by @xmath30 electrons at the interface and hence are fm aligned with the interface ; similarly , again in the adjacent layer , all the sites in the sub - lattice unoccupied by @xmath30 electrons have the same polarization as the sites occupied by @xmath30 electrons at the interface .",
    "the probability that a site , occupied ( unoccupied ) by an @xmath30 electron , contributes to the fm cluster is equal to the probability of finding the site occupied ( unoccupied ) multiplied by 1-p where p is the probability of not having any of the adjacent sites unoccupied ( occupied ) and belonging to the percolating cluster .",
    "thus , we obtain the following set of coupled equations : @xmath75 , \\label{magegn}\\ ] ] @xmath76 , \\label{magun}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) is the concentration of polarized sites that belong to the spanning cluster and these sites are a subset of the sites in the sub - lattice occupied ( unoccupied ) by @xmath30 electrons in the @xmath79 two - dimensional ( 2d ) mo layer with @xmath28 being the index measured from the insulator - smo interface .",
    "furthermore , @xmath80 is the @xmath33-coordinate of the @xmath79 2d mo layer .",
    "the factor @xmath81 [ @xmath82 represents the probability of a site that belongs to the sub - lattice occupied ( unoccupied ) by @xmath30 electrons in layer @xmath28 but is not part of the spanning polarized cluster .",
    "the boundary conditions involving layer 1 are @xmath83 , \\label{mageg1}\\ ] ] @xmath84 , \\label{magu1}\\ ] ] while those for the lmo - smo interface are @xmath85 .",
    "+      next , we will show that a few - layered lmo side can be border - line ferromagnetic [ i.e. , it is either barely fully ferromagnetic or close to being fully ferromagnetic ] which can be exploited to obtain giant magneto - electric effect .",
    "similar to the bulk situation@xcite , in our heterostructure as well , we assume that in each mo layer two @xmath30 electrons on adjacent sites have the same ferromagnetic coupling @xmath86 while two @xmath30 electrons on adjacent layers have again the same antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath87 . on the other hand , for an electron and a hole on adjacent sites in the same mo layer or adjacent mo layers , ( due to virtual hopping of electron between the two sites )",
    "there is a strong ferromagnetic coupling @xmath88 @xcite . in our calculations ,",
    "as long as the ratio of @xmath89 is fixed and @xmath90 is the significantly dominant coupling , we get the same magnetic picture .    when only a few mo layers are present in lmo , we will show that an lmo side that is not fully fm can be dramatically switched to being fully fm ( by increasing the concentration of holes in the layers ) upon application of a large external field . to establish this",
    ", we assume that the lmo - smo interface and all mo layers up to @xmath91 are completely polarized .",
    "next , we assume that mo layers @xmath91 and @xmath92 have low density of holes so that there is a possibility that spins in mo layer @xmath92 are not aligned with all mo layers up to layer @xmath91",
    ". we then analyze ( in appendix a ) the polarization of mo layer @xmath92 by comparing the energies for the following two cases : + ( i ) layers @xmath92 and @xmath91 are antiferromagnetically aligned with the holes in layers @xmath91 and @xmath92 inducing polarization only on sites that are adjacent to the holes ; and + ( ii ) mo layer @xmath92 is completely polarized and aligned with layer @xmath91 .",
    "+ in an lmo system that is three unit cell thick , for @xmath93 ev ( as shown in fig .",
    "2 ) , we obtained a striking magneto - electric effect . for zero external field , when @xmath94 is considered , case ( i ) has lower energy , i.e. , layer 1 is antiferromagnetically coupled to layer 2 . on the other hand ,",
    "when a strong electric field ( @xmath95 ) is applied , mo layer 1 ( due to increased density of holes ) becomes completely polarized and ferromagnetically aligned with the rest of the layers ( i.e. , mo layers 2 , 3 , and the oxide - oxide interface ) .",
    "_ thus , we get a giant magneto - electric effect ! _ similarly , in a @xmath96 heterostructure , for @xmath97 ev ( as shown in fig .",
    "3 ) , we again obtain a huge magneto - electric effect .",
    "we used the fact that when the two mott insulators lmo and smo are brought together to form a heterostructure , one may realize the entire phase diagram of @xmath6 across the heterostructure with the @xmath7 phase occurring at the lmo surface at one end and evolving to the @xmath98 state at the oxide - oxide interface and finally to the @xmath8 phase at the other end of smo . by changing the charge profile using an applied electric field",
    ", we showed that the fmi region can be expanded at the expense of the a - type afm domain thereby producing a giant magnetoelectric effect .",
    "since the competing phases at the interface of the fmi and the a - type afm region are close in energy , the interface can be tuned to be on the verge of a fm transition by the application of a magnetic field of the order of a tesla ( as the zeeman energy is comparable to the difference in the fm coupling @xmath99 and the afm coupling @xmath100 ) ; then , applying a tiny electric field will produce a fm transition at the interface .",
    "we also would like to mention that if a superlattice were formed from the heterostructure @xmath0 , then the dipoles from each repeating heterostructure unit will add up to produce a giant electric dipole moment . on the other hand , if the insulating layers were not present , the superlattice formed from the repeating unit @xmath101 would not produce a large electric dipole as the charge from lmo can leak to smo on both sides leading to a small net dipole moment .",
    "lastly , minimizing the energy expressed as a functional of density and magnetization at a fixed electric field ( so as to get simultaneously both charge and magnetization profiles ) is more accurate ( albeit tedious ) than solving , as we did , for the charge profile and using it to get the magnetization picture .",
    "this better alternative can also address the issue of how an external magnetic field affects the density profile and the ferroelectric moment .      in this appendix",
    ", we will analyze the nature of magnetism on the lmo side . to begin , we assume that all mo layers from @xmath91 to the oxide - oxide interface ( i.e. , mo layers @xmath91 , @xmath102 , ... ) are completely polarized .",
    "we then bring a completely polarized mo layer to form the layer @xmath92 next to the mo layer @xmath91 and wish to determine the interaction energy between layer @xmath92 and layer @xmath91 and their relative polarization .",
    "we compare the energies in the following two scenarios : + ( i ) mo layer @xmath92 is antiferromagnetically aligned with layer @xmath91 and there is an induced polarization next to the holes in these layers , i.e. , all the sites that are adjacent to the holes in layers @xmath91 and @xmath92 end up having the same polarization as the holes ; and + ( ii ) mo layer @xmath92 is completely polarized and ferromagnetically aligned with layer @xmath91 .",
    "+ the energy of interaction in case ( i ) is the sum of the two terms @xmath103 and @xmath104 obtained below : + ( a ) when an electron in the electron sub - lattice of layer @xmath91 is not surrounded by a hole in either layer @xmath91 or layer @xmath102 [ the probability of which is @xmath105 , then the hole in layer @xmath92 flips the spin of the electron below it in layer @xmath91 .",

    "<S> ferroelectric polarization is produced by charges leaking from @xmath1 side to the @xmath2 side on account of the effective nearest - neighbor repulsion of electrons resulting from electron - phonon interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the ferromagnetism is due to double exchange when a particle virtually hops to its unoccupied neighboring site and back . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we also demonstrate that a striking giant magnetoelectric effect occurs due to the strong coupling between the charge and spin orderings . </S>"
