    ", optical interferometry using light as a probe modified in the optical phase by a matter sample @xcite can be combined with quantum interfaces and transducers between matter and light or microwaves @xcite . a steady experimental development of quantum interfaces between light and atomic ensembles @xcite",
    "was recently followed by a dynamic experimental boom of electromechanical and optomechanical interfaces @xcite , the extension of which is expected to continue .",
    "the combinations of light - matter interfaces and optical interferometry allow a use of matter at quantum level as a sensitive probe of physical processes caused by its environment .",
    "light ( or microwaves ) only prepares and reads out the quantum state of the matter probe .",
    "this is an interesting extension of a broad class of quantum interferometry and metrology @xcite , where the state of light is only changed by unitary dynamics and not at all transferred to matter and passed back on to light .",
    "a pioneering example of the extended strategy is quantum magnetometry with atomic ensembles already exploiting nonclassical light and correlations transferred to atomic ensembles @xcite . recently",
    ", this development has stimulated first considerations in quantum sensing of mechanical motion and other physical quantities .",
    "these approaches broaden the horizons of quantum metrology with correlated and potentially nonclassical matter probes in addition to nonclassical light reading it out .",
    "the basic configuration of light - matter interferometry investigated here has a fully optical path and a matter path .",
    "light - matter quantum interferometry consists of four principal steps : first , a light - matter interface which can partially transfer quantum states of light to typically thermal states of matter ; second , the quantum state of matter is modified by the process coming from the environment ( the estimation of this process is the objective of our work ) ; third , a light - matter interface which can partially transfer the modified matter state back to light ; fourth , the quantum state of the light is measured and the matter process is estimated . such an arrangement allows to discuss and compare various basic configurations of light - matter interferometry , depicted in figs .",
    "[ scheme ] and [ schemeb ] .",
    "in contrast to standard optical interferometry , two experimental limitations are commonly present .",
    "light is typically coupled with matter only weakly , the complete ideal swap of the quantum state of the light to matter and back is limited by decoherence , damping and noise .",
    "these set a limit on the interaction strength of the light - matter interface if it should be close to unitary quantum coupling .",
    "moreover , the matter state is typically noisy and cooling it to the ground state can be limited , especially in the early stage of experiments .",
    "in addition , only one output of the light - matter interferometry is measured , because the matter state can not be measured well without an additional noise due to the weakness of light - matter coupling .",
    "such limitations are not present in optical interferometry @xcite due to the almost ideal performance of the beam splitters ( bs ) , the high mode matching , the vacuum states in the empty port of the beam splitter and direct access to both light beams after the interferometer by intensity or homodyne detectors",
    ". the experimental limitations of the light - matter interface therefore raise many questions , mainly , if it is possible to perform an estimation of the matter process for an arbitrarily weak coupling with matter noise . the answer to the main question about",
    "the quality of realistic light - matter quantum interferometry is an important step before specifics of experimental platforms can be analyzed .",
    "we therefore propose and analyze the estimation of the processes changing a matter oscillator ( mechanical , electrical , atomic ) by an environment using a realistic light - matter interferometry with coherent light and homodyne detection .",
    "we use a beam splitter type of light - matter interaction common for experimental platforms with matter oscillators @xcite and analysis of optical interferometry @xcite .",
    "we focus on the estimation of a general gaussian process @xcite in the phase space of a single matter oscillator ( includes simultaneously a phase - shift , a displacement and a squeezing of the oscillating amplitudes ) .",
    "it covers a broad class of weak physical couplings of a matter probe to an environment which can be linearized in the amplitudes of oscillations .",
    "different estimators are investigated for various setups and their efficiencies are compared for different parameters .",
    "our results show that light - matter interferometry is in principle possible and therefore they open the way for more technical investigations for specific experimental platforms .",
    "the investigated scheme is shown in fig .  [ scheme ] .",
    "we have two independent modes , the first is a matter mode @xmath0 which is in thermal equilibrium with variance @xmath1 , and the second a coherent light mode @xmath2 with amplitude @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 and @xmath5 be the creation and annihilation operators for the matter mode @xmath0 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 the same for the light mode @xmath2 .",
    "we use an interferometric type of setting ( we will later compare this with other scenarios as well ) , meaning that we couple the two modes , apply the unknown gaussian process to the matter state , and use a coupling again .",
    "we assume that we are in the regime in which matter and light interact as if there were a beam splitter ( bs ) .",
    "the bs interface has been already obtained between radiation and atoms as well as mechanical oscillators @xcite .",
    "these interactions are typically weak , so the transmittance of the bs interface should be considered low ( @xmath8 ) . finally , in contrast to classical interferometry",
    ", we can not access both modes , we can only measure the light mode .",
    "if we use a homodyne or heterodyne measurement ( on @xmath9 independent states ) we can directly access the quadrature values of the light .",

    "@xmath1 interfaces with a coherent light ( mode @xmath2 ) with amplitude @xmath3 ; their interaction is approximated well by a beam - splitter ( bs ) with transmittance @xmath10 .",
    "further on , the matter mode is modified by an unknown gaussian process ( g.p . ) stimulated by the environment .",
    "the two modes then interact again on a second bs - type interface with transmittance @xmath11 .",
    "finally , the quadratures of the light are measured with heterodyne ( or homodyne ) detection to estimate the parameters of the gaussian process .",
    "the other , matter mode is not measured . ]",
    "we decompose the gaussian unitary process induced by the environment on the matter mode @xmath0 into three parts : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the squeezing operator ( with @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 is the phase - shift operator , and @xmath16 is the displacement operator ( with @xmath17 ) .",
    "the squeezing is described by the magnitude @xmath18 and by the direction @xmath19 of the squeezing .",
    "the displacement is described by its magnitude @xmath20 and its direction @xmath21 .",
    "the combination of these three transformations describes each possible gaussian transformation of a given gaussian state which preserves the mixedness of the original state .",
    "we investigated general gaussian processes , since they are sufficient approximations for linearized processes in the matter .",
    "we assume that all parameters of the scheme ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) are known , however , there are limitations .",
    "the effective transmittances @xmath10 , from the light mode @xmath2 to the matter mode @xmath0 , and @xmath11 , from matter mode @xmath0 to light mode @xmath2 are limited to small values by decoherence and thermalization . at the sam time",
    ", the variance @xmath1 of matter noise is typically large at the room temperature .",
    "the amplitude @xmath3 of coherent light can be increased if necessary .",
    "our task is to estimate the parameters of the unknown gaussian process , namely , @xmath23 .      before investigating dependence of the performance of different estimators on other parameters of the scheme",
    ", a figure of merit must be chosen .",
    "this choice is , however , not self - evident .",
    "the use of the quantum fisher information is undesirable in the current scenario since we can not measure one of the modes , so it could only be calculated just before the homodyne / heterodyne measurement of the light .",
    "thus , it makes more sense to incorporate also the measurement into the calculation , that is , calculate the fisher information after the measurement , or calculate the variance of the estimator .",
    "the fisher information for parameter @xmath24 with a given likelihood function @xmath25 can be calculated as @xcite @xmath26    in general , a larger fisher information means more information about the given parameter .",
    "however , it does not provide any information about the used estimator , it only gives us a theoretical bound on the variance by the cramer - rao inequality @xcite : @xmath27    the variance of a non - linear estimator is difficult to calculate analytically , hence we also used the empirical mean squared error ( mse ) : @xmath28 where @xmath0 denotes a technical parameter : the number of repetitions of the numerical simulations ( we used @xmath29 ) .",
    "that is , to obtain the mse we generated @xmath0 different realizations of the estimator independently , and checked their average squared distance from the real parameters .",
    "note that the number of measurements @xmath9 is not related to this quantity , it is the number of measurements in a single realization .",
    "the connection to the cramer - rao bound is that we have in limit @xmath30 , where the first approximation is true if @xmath0 is large ( law of large numbers ) , while the second approximation is true if @xmath9 is large ( the estimator @xmath31 is asymptotically unbiased ) .",
    "as we are working with the first and second moments of gaussian states the only problem that can occur is that a covariance matrix will not be physical , that is , it will not fulfill the heisenberg uncertainty relation @xcite .",
    "this can basically occur only if the thermal state of matter is close to vacuum and the number of measurements ( @xmath9 ) is low .",
    "that is , in a practical setup this is unlikely to happen , but even if it does , we can map an unphysical covariance matrix to a close , physical one .",
    "before we handle the general case , let us investigate some special cases first .",
    "the most simple , but still relevant case is when the unknown gaussian process consists only of a displacement . in terms of the parameters",
    ", this means that we can assume that @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and the only parameters of interest are @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the magnitude and direction of the displacement vector .",
    "note that this is an important scenario , since it corresponds to the short - time impact of a constant external force .    we can perform the estimation of these parameters even in the most simplistic scenario ( fig .",
    "[ schemeb ] , left subfigure ) : the displacement is applied directly to the matter mode , we couple this with the optical mode , and from the change of the optical mode we can estimate the desired parameters . and we can use an alternative version ( fig .",
    "[ schemeb ] , right subfigure ) : the light can be coupled with the matter on the first bs , but after that it is blocked , so on the second bs the optical mode is in vacuum state . for the sake of complete analysis we can mention a fourth case , when we do not use a coherent state either for preparation or for measurement ( i.e. , having the simplistic scenario but using a vacuum source for light ) , but this is equivalent to the simplistic scenario shown in fig .",
    "[ schemeb ] , left subfigure .",
    "variations for different setups : ( left ) the most simplistic setup , where the the interface is applied only after the measured unknown gaussian process , ( right ) light interfaces with the matter at the first bs interaction , but is blocked after that , so the coherent light is only used for the preparation of the state , not for read - out by the second interface.,title=\"fig : \" ]   variations for different setups : ( left ) the most simplistic setup , where the the interface is applied only after the measured unknown gaussian process , ( right ) light interfaces with the matter at the first bs interaction , but is blocked after that , so the coherent light is only used for the preparation of the state , not for read - out by the second interface.,title=\"fig : \" ]    for a more accurate description let us denote the @xmath36-quadrature ( @xmath37 ) of the mechanical mode with @xmath38 , the @xmath36-quadrature of the coherent light with @xmath39 . let us assume that the phase of the coherent state is in the @xmath36-direction .",

    "the unknown process changes the mechanical mode : @xmath44 , where @xmath45 .",
    "the measured mode after the beam splitting will be @xmath46    if we take the mean of this equation , we get @xmath47 , from which we can simply estimate the unknown displacement : @xmath48 similarly , for the @xmath49-quadratures ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) we obtain @xmath52 and obtain the estimator @xmath53 the estimator of @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be easily constructed using the previous estimators : @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "let us calculate the fisher information for parameter @xmath34 ( the conclusions for @xmath35 are very similar ) .",
    "the likelihood function is given on a two dimensional plane of quadratures : @xmath56 and for large @xmath9 it can be approximated well ( due to the central limit theorem ) with a gaussian distribution , the first moments of which are already calculated , while its second moments are @xmath57 . in this particular situation",
    "the second derivative of @xmath58 will be constant , so we can easily obtain the fisher information : @xmath59 it is also easy to check that we have @xmath60 , so the cramr - rao bound is sharp , the obtained estimator is efficient .",
    "we can see that the estimation is more precise , i.e. , fisher information ( [ one ] ) increases , if @xmath11 is larger , or @xmath1 is smaller ( and does not depend on @xmath3 ) . for a large @xmath1",

    "we can calculate the fisher information similarly , and obtain @xmath72 for a given @xmath11 this will be maximal for @xmath73 ( then having @xmath74 ) , but that means we can transfer the state of the optical mode completely to matter , but in practice both @xmath10 and @xmath11 are limited , in which regime the efficiency of this setup is close to the previous one s ( fig .",

    "the reason behind this is simple : in the previous cases the thermal variance of the matter passes to the measurement causing a higher uncertainty , while if we use an interferometric scheme , this effect can be eliminated completely .",
    "this means that if the variance of the thermal mode is initially high , we can improve the estimation significantly using an interferometric scheme up to a fisher information only limited by @xmath81 ( see fig .",
    "[ ind ] , left subfigure , solid line ) .",
    "it is very stimulating , since we can obtain metrology of matter without cooling it down .",
    "let us compare it to the case where the unknown gaussian process contains only a phase - shift .",
    "that is , we can assume that @xmath32 , @xmath82 and the only parameter we are interested in is @xmath69 .    in this case",
    "the simplistic scheme is not useful at all , since if we apply a phase - shift to a thermal state and then couple it with a coherent beam , then the measurement outcome will be the same , independently from the phase - shift parameter @xmath69 .    on the other hand , using the interferometric scheme we can estimate @xmath69 in two different ways , since the phase - shift changes both the first and the second moments of the measured mode .",
    "the variance of the output mode is @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "so we obtain the estimator @xmath86    the other alternative is using the means of the output mode , which are @xmath87 and @xmath88 . from these",
    "we obtain the estimator @xmath89    we can also calculate the fisher information by using a gaussian approximation of the output , but in this case it can be done only numerically .",
    "we can see in the right subfigure of fig .",
    "[ ind ] that for small values of @xmath3 it is the first estimation method ( @xmath90 ) , while for the large values of @xmath3 it is the second estimator ( @xmath91 ) that performs close to the theoretical optimum .",
    "it is not surprising that the two discussed methods have different optimal working regimes , since using the means for estimation purposes is only preferable if their values are large enough to detect a change in them .",
    "the change of the variance is , in contrast , preferable if the thermal source is stronger than the coherent one .",
    "the first estimator does not depend on the parameter @xmath3 , while the second estimator has a mse which is proportional to @xmath92 .",
    "so there is a critical value of @xmath3 ( denote it with @xmath93 ) , where the mses of two methods are the same , the first is better if @xmath94 and the second estimator is better if @xmath95 .",
    "unfortunately , it is hard to tell in general the actual value of @xmath93 , since it depends on the other parameters too . nevertheless , it is true that for larger values of @xmath1 the value of @xmath93 will also increase , while for larger values of transmittances the value of @xmath93 will decrease .",
    "so , in general , it is not trivial to tell , which estimator is better , but if the strength of the coherent light is increased , then using the means for estimation will eventually be better .",
    "although it is impossible to determine which estimator is better analytically , we can circumvent this issue numerically by dividing the measurement data in several packages ( @xmath96 ) , perform estimations independently on each package , and then compare the variances of the estimators for the two methods .",
    "if we have the actual estimates @xmath97 and @xmath98 , let their variances be @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively",
    ". then by simple comparison of @xmath99 and @xmath100 we can decide which estimator has a smaller variance .",
    "moreover , we can combine the two estimators into an aggregated estimator : @xmath101 this estimator would produce a similar magnitude of error as the theoretical optimum for any value of @xmath3 ( in fig .  [ ind ] , right subfigure , black thin and purple thick line basically coincide ) .",
    "we can compare this also with the case of the blocked optical beam , and interestingly in this case the situation is not so clear as it was for the displacement : the interferometric scheme is only better if @xmath102 .",
    "the reason is simple again , if we change the phase of state too much , the interferometry does not decrease the variance but rather increases , so blocking the optical mode can be actually helpful .",
    "the difference is , however , not significant for practical ranges of the scheme parameters ( i.e. , when @xmath81 and @xmath1 are small ) .",
    "we omit the discussion of the case when the gaussian process only contains squeezing , because it is very similar to the phase - shift only case discussed here and these examples have been presented mainly to demonstrate peculiar features of the light - matter interferometry .",
    "in what follows , we investigate the estimation of a general gaussian process simultaneously consisting of displacement , phase - shift and squeezing ( with parameters @xmath103 ) .",
    "interestingly , we can generalize the two methods used for the estimation of the phase - shift in the previous section , and the obtained estimators will show strong similarities to the already discussed cases . from the previous discussion we can conclude that the interferometric scheme clearly outperforms the simplistic scheme , while blocking the optical beam can be useful in some cases , but it is of minor importance , so in the following we will restrict our investigation only to the interferometric scheme .",
    "the displacement of the state only affects the mean of the state , but both phase - shift and squeezing causes a change in the mean and the covariance matrix as well . using these statistics , one can devise the following methods of estimation :    _ method ( i ) - estimation using the covariance matrix : _ if there is squeezing ( @xmath104 ) , then the covariance matrix can be characterized uniquely using the unknown parameters @xmath105 .",
    "unfortunately , the covariance matrix is a complicated function of the parameters , so the inversion could be done only numerically .",
    "nevertheless , the parameters of the squeezing and the phase - shift can be obtained from the covariance matrix of an arbitrary input state , and then we can check what effect this result has on the mean of the input state .",
    "finally , if we compare the means of the output state and the input state after applying the squeezing and the phase - shift , the difference yields the unknown displacement ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "_ method ( ii ) - estimation using only the mean values : _ using a single input we can not characterize the process simply because of dimensional issues ( the mean has 2 parameters , the process has 5 parameters ) , but this problem can be overcome if we use multiple input states .",
    "for example , if we use two coherent inputs with opposite phases , then the mean after the squeezing and the phase - shift will remain the same with a difference of @xmath107 .",
    "that is , their sum will be zero , so the average of the output will give exactly the unknown displacement .",

    "[ rv ] right subfigure , solid lines ) .",

    "the estimators for method ( ii ) behave differently than those derived from the covariance matrix ( fig .",
    "[ rv ] , dashed lines ) . increasing the strength of our coherent source ( @xmath3 )",
    "does not have an effect on the estimation of the displacement , since the averaging eliminates the effect of the initial displacement .",
    "for the squeezing and the phase - shift we can achieve an improvement because their effect is more visible if the initial amplitude of the coherent light is larger ( similarly to the larger variance in the case of the covariance matrix )",
    ". the larger variance of the thermal source ( @xmath1 ) in this scenario only adds more noise to our estimation so the errors of all estimators will increase if @xmath1 is increased .    from the previous analysis",
    "we can conclude that the two estimation methods are optimal in different working regimes .",
    "a larger @xmath1 is better for the method based on the covariance matrix , a larger @xmath3 is better for the method which uses only the mean values .",
    "however , the two estimation procedures can be performed simultaneously : when using the second method , the first method can be also applied on all three input states and one can calculate the average of the three sets of estimates .",
    "this has several advantages : first , we can check whether our model is consistent with reality . since both",
    "our estimation methods give us asymptotically unbiased estimators , for large values of @xmath9 they should be close to the real values .",
    "so if there is a large difference in the values coming from the two estimation methods we can be sure that there is some significant effect which has been neglected .",
    "furthermore , we can combine the two estimators ( similarly as in the case of phase - shift ) in order to decrease estimation variance .",
    "the combination can produce high estimation efficiencies for the squeezing and the phase - shift for any value of @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ rv ] , right subfigure ) .",
    "it is better if we use a stronger coherent light ( @xmath3 is large ) because that can improve the estimation of the squeezing and the phase - shift significantly .",
    "if we are interested in the estimation of the displacement ( but other parameters are simultaneously unknown ) we can conclude that it does not depend on the strength of the coherent light , but a larger variance of the thermal matter results in a less accurate estimation .      moving on from the properties of the initial states to the properties of the optical elements , and",

    "we have applied the following parameters for the scheme : @xmath109 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 ( right ) @xmath117 , @xmath118 and for the unknown process : @xmath71 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath110 , @xmath111.,title=\"fig : \" ]    let us also note that the optimal performance is achieved for method ( i ) around @xmath119 , that is , when the interferometry is symmetrical . on the other hand , for method ( ii ) the optimum is achieved at @xmath120 , when the mirrors are fully reflective , meaning that the gaussian process is applied directly to the strong coherent mode , and also the output of the process can be measured with homodyne measurement .",
    "this is useful if we are estimating only the means , but completely kills method ( i ) since then the gaussian process is applied to a coherent source with minimal variance , which makes it impossible to reconstruct the parameters .",
    "however , in practice the value of @xmath81 is limited to low values , because for larger values of @xmath81 there an additional decoherence and noise appears @xcite , which could ruin our estimation .",
    "every result presented so far is based on the assumption of an ideal scenario , but in practice noise and damping of the matter can be present .",
    "we assumed that these imperfections are added during the gaussian process .",
    "we assumed that the critical place is the gaussian process .",
    "we simulate it with a coupled thermal source after the gaussian process , which adds to the matter mode a thermal noise with variance @xmath121 and a loss described by the transmittance @xmath122 .",
    "more precisely , we assume that this is caused by the actual physical settings , so it is present independently of the unknown process on the matter mode .",
    "so in principle , we can use a calibration step to estimate the noise and the loss when the measured gaussian process is turned off .",
    "and then we can include this estimate in our formulas to get more precise estimates of the parameters of the process .",
    "we will use method ( ii ) for numerical characterization , we saw that performs better for realistic parameters , but since it uses only the mean values , it is robust against noise .",
    "we can see that our method is robust even against noise : by using the two - step algorithm the estimation efficiency does not really depend on the actual values of the loss ( fig .",
    "[ t1 ] , right subfigure , dashed lines ) .",
    "while if we do not use any calibration ( we assume that the channel is ideal , even if it is not ) , the same does not hold , the estimation of the displacement and the squeezing is sensitive to the losses ( fig .",
    "[ t1 ] , dotted lines ) .",
    "we investigated the estimation of a gaussian process changing a matter mode , the effect of which is measured using an ancillary light mode .",
    "we proposed an interferometric setup exploiting quantum interfaces and homodyne / heterodyne detectors and two methods for the estimation of the unknown gaussian channel : ( i ) based on the covariance matrix of the measured amplitudes , ( ii ) based only on the means of the measured amplitudes .",
    "we compared the results to non - interferometric schemes ( applying the gaussian process to the thermal noise of the matter directly or to its mixture with a coherent light ) and proved the advantage of the interferometric scheme .",
    "for the estimation of matter phase - shift alone , we found that for a large - intensity coherent light , method ( ii ) is sufficient for optimal estimation , while if the strength of the matter source is comparable to that of the coherent light , method ( i ) is required to reach the optimal estimation .",
    "this demonstrates a nontrivial optimization of the light - matter interferometry .",
    "the estimation of a general gaussian process including non - classical squeezing was analyzed in detail using both estimation methods .",
    "we showed that a larger intensity of the coherent light used in the interferometry compensates the thermal noise of the matter .",
    "we also verified that we can obtain high - precision estimates despite the moderate coupling strength of the light - matter interfaces and access to only the light mode from the interferometer .",
    "finally , we showed that a small loss and noise joined with the estimated gaussian process is not critical for light - matter interferometry . in conclusion , all these results suggest that the proposed light - matter interferometry is feasible in realistic settings , and therefore it can open the way for future investigations of specific experimental platforms ( e.g. , in quantum optomechanics ) .",
