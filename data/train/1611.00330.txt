    "the goal of this paper is to give a unified construction of various families of lattices in the isometry group @xmath0 of the complex hyperbolic plane @xmath1 .",
    "we describe a systematic manner to produce fundamental domains , that works for all known triangle group lattices ( with minor modifications for some pathological cases ) .",
    "the groups we consider turn out to produce all currently known examples of non - arithmetic lattices in @xmath0 . until recently , all such groups were contained ( up to commensurability ) in the list of lattices that appears in work of deligne - mostow / thurston , see  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ( a lot of these groups were discovered over a century ago by picard , and studied by several people including terada ) .",
    "these groups give nine commensurability classes of non - arithmetic lattices , but the determination of the precise number of commensurability classes required a significant amount of work ( see  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ) .    in  @xcite",
    ", we announced the construction of 12 lattices , which give at least 9 new non - arithmetic commensurability classes .",
    "the most difficult part of that work is the proof that the groups are lattices .",
    "indeed , the fact that they are not commensurable to any deligne - mostow lattice can be proved by the somewhat rough commensurability invariant given by the field generated by traces in the adjoint representation . the fact that they are not arithmetic follows from a standard application of the complex reflection version of the vinberg arithmeticity criterion ( see  @xcite , for instance ) .",
    "the proof of discreteness relies on the construction of an explicit fundamental domain for each group .",
    "there are general ways to produce such fundamental domains , for instance dirichlet domains , but these often turn out to give overly complicated combinatorics ( see  @xcite for instance ) .",
    "the domains used in  @xcite are quite simple and natural .",
    "their vertices are all given by ( well - chosen ) intersections of mirrors of reflections in the group , their 1-faces are all geodesic arcs , and 2-faces are as natural as possible in the context of the non - constant curvature geometry of the complex hyperbolic plane ( they lie on intersections of so - called bisectors ) .",
    "the combinatorial construction of the domains was inspired by the fundamental domains constructed by rich schwartz in  @xcite , and work related to james thompson s thesis  @xcite .",
    "the general procedure turns out to be quite elementary , and a lot of it can be described by hand ( even though a lot of the computations are much easier to perform with a computer ) .",
    "we will review and clarify the construction , and show that it applies to a wide class of complex hyperbolic triangle groups . as a result",
    ", we get new fundamental domains for many groups that appeared previously in the literature , including many of the deligne - mostow lattices .",
    "our methods also allow us to treat the 6 sporadic triangle groups left over from  @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath2 the sporadic triangle group generated by a complex reflection @xmath3 with rotation angle @xmath4 and an order 3 isometry @xmath5 with @xmath6 ; see table  [ tab : tauvalues ] for the meaning of the notation @xmath7 .",
    "the family of groups @xmath8 was studied in @xcite .",
    "[ thm : sporadicna ] the groups @xmath9 are non - arithmetic lattices for @xmath10 .",
    "the groups @xmath11 are non - arithmetic lattices for @xmath12 .",
    "they are not commensurable to any deligne - mostow lattice , nor to any lattice of the form @xmath8 .",
    "[ thm : sporadica ] the group @xmath13 is an arithmetic lattice , and so are the groups @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "we also consider a slightly different family of lattices @xmath16 , that comes out of james thompson s thesis ( see table  [ tab : tvalues ] ) .",
    "we prove that some of them are non - arithmetic and also that they are new , in the sense that they are not commensurable to any deligne - mostow lattice , nor to any sporadic triangle group .",
    "[ thm : thompson ] the groups @xmath17 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 are non - arithmetic lattices .",
    "they are not commensurable to each other , to any deligne - mostow lattice , nor to any sporadic triangle group .",
    "this statement follows from the analysis of adjoint trace fields ( see section  [ sec : tracefields ] ) and the fact that this group has non - arithmeticity index one , see section  [ sec : spectrum ] .",
    "a more detailed analysis , requiring more subtle arguments , shows the following ( see section  [ sec : commensurability ] , table  [ tab : commclasses ] in particular ) .",
    "[ thm : numberofclasses ] the currently known non - arithmetic lattices in @xmath0 come in 22 commensurability classes .",
    "it was recently observed  @xcite that some of these non - arithmetic lattices actually appear in a list of lattices constructed by couwenberg , heckman and looijenga  @xcite , that gave a common generalization of work of barthel - hirzebruch - hfer  @xcite and deligne - mostow  @xcite .",
    "we refer to these lattices as chl lattices .",
    "note that , apart from deligne - mostow lattices , the chl lattices contain three families of 2-dimensional lattices , corresponding to line arrangements in @xmath20 of type @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . using the same techniques as the ones in  @xcite , one verifies that these three families correspond to our families @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively ( see also  @xcite ) .    using the analysis in section  [ sec : commensurability ] ( table  [ tab : commclasses ] in particular ) , we see that our lattices @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath19 are non - arithmetic lattices that are not commensurable to any chl lattice .",
    "we assume the reader is familiar with basic notions of hyperbolic geometry over some base field , and with coxeter groups . to get a quick idea of the main differences between real and complex hyperbolic geometry , the reader can consult  @xcite .",
    "we will freely use the classification of isometries into elliptic , parabolic and loxodromic elements , sometimes with slight refinements ( a regular elliptic isometry is an elliptic isometry whose matrix representatives have no repeated eigenvalue , for instance ) .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for background on complex hyperbolic geometry and bisectors , see also section  2 of  @xcite for a quick review .",
    "let @xmath32 and @xmath33 be two elliptic elements in @xmath31 , which we assume to be primitive of the same order , i.e. they rotate in @xmath34 by an angle @xmath4 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "it is a well known fact that the discreteness of the group is controlled by the product @xmath37 , in the following sense .",
    "[ prop : knapp ] if @xmath38 is a lattice , then @xmath37 is non - loxodromic .",
    "if @xmath37 is elliptic , then the group is a lattice if and only if @xmath37 rotates by an angle @xmath39 for some @xmath40 , or by @xmath41 .      proposition  [ prop : knapp ] will serve as a model for higher dimensional analogues ( we will look for simple words in the generators whose behavior determines whether or not the group is a lattice ) , and it is also important because it explains the behavior of subgroups generated by two complex reflections in @xmath1 ( by looking at the projective line of lines through the intersection of the mirrors , possibly in projective space ) .",
    "a natural analogue of the elliptic elements of @xmath31 for higher dimensions is given by complex reflections in @xmath42 , whose representative matrices have an eigenvalue of multiplicity @xmath43",
    ". geometrically , such an isometry fixes pointwise a complex projective hyperplane called its mirror , and rotates about it by a certain angle . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss groups generated by two such complex reflections .",
    "let @xmath45 be complex reflections with angle @xmath4 , with distinct mirrors .",
    "we assume they each have eigenvalues @xmath46 , where @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath48 and @xmath49 be polar vectors to the mirrors of @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively ; that is @xmath48 and @xmath49 are @xmath52-eigenvectors .",
    "note that @xmath53 is an eigenvalue of @xmath54 , corresponding to the intersection of the multiple eigenspaces of @xmath50 and @xmath51 . indeed using formulae in  @xcite ,",
    "see also  @xcite , we can write down the trace of @xmath54 .                throughout the paper",
    ", we will use the following terminology for * braid relations * between group elements ( see section 2.2 of mostow @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath62 is a group and @xmath63 , we say that @xmath64 and @xmath32 satisfy a braid relation of length @xmath40 if @xmath65 where powers that are half integers should be interpreted as saying that the corresponding alternating product of @xmath64 and @xmath32 should have @xmath43 factors .",
    "for instance , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , etc . for short , we will sometimes write the sentence `` @xmath64 and @xmath32 satisfy a braid relation of length @xmath43 '' simply as `` @xmath69 '' .        *",
    "a braid relation of length 2 simply means @xmath64 and @xmath32 commute . *",
    "the classical braid relation @xmath72 is a braid relation of length 3 . *",
    "if @xmath64 and @xmath32 both have order 2 , @xmath73 if and only if their product has order @xmath43 . *",
    "if @xmath69 holds for some integer @xmath43 , then clearly the relation @xmath74 also holds for every integer @xmath75 .",
    "in particular , the relation @xmath69 does not imply @xmath73 , but it does imply @xmath71 divides @xmath43 .",
    "[ prop : braiding ] if @xmath76 for some integer @xmath79 , then @xmath80 .",
    "moreover , the group generated by @xmath50 and @xmath51 in @xmath0 is a central extension of the rotation subgroup of a triangle group .",
    "if @xmath81 is odd , then its center is generated by @xmath82 and the corresponding quotient is a @xmath83-triangle group .",
    "if @xmath81 is even , the center is generated by @xmath84 and the quotient is a @xmath85 triangle group .",
    "when mentioning @xmath86-triangle groups , we always assume @xmath87 are integers . by the rotation subgroup of a @xmath86-triangle group ,",
    "we mean the index two subgroup of orientation preserving isometries in the group generated by real reflections in the sides of a triangle with angles @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 ( note that such a triangle lives in @xmath91 , @xmath92 or @xmath93 depending on @xmath94 ) . in other words , it is generated by rotations around the vertices of the triangle , with respective angles @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 ."
