    "vibrating objects are a common tool used in low temperature physics in order to probe the intriguing properties of quantum fluids .",
    "one of the first devices employed has been the so - called vibrating wire , which has enabled the direct measurement of the coldest temperatures in superfluid he@xmath2 ever reported @xcite .",
    "other devices have been used like oscillating spheres @xcite , and today an increasing number of physicists are taking advantage of the very practical quartz tuning fork technique @xcite .",
    "the grenoble group has been following another path : the idea being taking advantage of the versatility of microfabrication techniques @xcite .",
    "we have been developing and testing `` goalpost '' shaped silicon devices , in both a mems@xmath3@xmath4 and nems@xmath3@xmath4 variant having respectively ( transverse ) dimensions ranging from a few microns to a hundred nanometers @xcite .",
    "they both display extremely promising mechanical properties , with for the first out - of - plane flexural mode high quality factors and frequencies lying within typically @xmath5khz up to @xmath6mhz .",
    "all of these structures also have higher flexural modes .",
    "these modes have rather complex shapes , but present a very simple way to probe the fluid at substantially different frequencies .",
    "they can also be thought of as an opportunity to set up new measuring schemes , like driving one mode ( at one frequency ) and measuring another one ( having a very different frequency ) , mimicking the setup used for so - called mode - coupling mechanical experiments @xcite .    in the present paper we report on experiments performed on a mems ( al on silicon ) goalpost device , in vacuum at 4.2@xmath0k . during this work we also measured a nems device ( made of the same materials ) , reaching the same conclusions .",
    "the excitation and detection is performed with the well known magnetomotive scheme .",
    "details , including the fabrication processes can be found in refs .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations enabling to understand the flexural mode shapes , and to predict the measured resonance frequencies of the 3 first symmetric modes .",
    "an analytic model is given reproducing these numerical results , with no free parameters .",

    "the modeling does not incorporate any in - built stresses .    from simulations we realize that the out - of - plane flexure essentially reproduces the natural modes of cantilevers ( the feet , in common motion ) loaded at the end by the force exerted by the distortion of the paddle .",
