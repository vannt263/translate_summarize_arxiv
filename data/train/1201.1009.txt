    "just as the relative roles of genetics and environment in shaping human populations are hotly debated , so are the analogous processes argued among those who study the evolution of galaxies .",
    "the `` nature '' of a galaxy is thought to be primarily determined by the mass of its dark matter halo , since in isolation the collapse of a given amount of matter should give rise to descendents with a consistent set of properties @xcite .",
    "however , like humans , galaxies do nt often mature in isolation : their `` nurturing '' is brought about through gas inflows from the extended cosmic web , mergers with other galaxies , and even direct interactions with hot , dense intergalactic gas ( e.g. ram pressure stripping ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while it is well - established that galaxies morphologies @xcite , colors @xcite , and star - formation properties @xcite differ in overdense and underdense environments , the reasons behind these correlations are still uncertain .    by targeting mass - selected galaxy samples in a range of environments ,",
    "the role of `` neighborhood '' can be disentangled from that of mass .",
    "on the extremes , void galaxies which evolve essentially in isolation tend to exhibit stable , gas - rich , star - forming configurations @xcite , while those in rich clusters are overwhelmingly quiescent and have morphologies which suggest frequent high - speed interactions or mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although such environments provide invaluable laboratories for the study of _ ex- _ and _ in - situ _ galaxy evolution respectively , they represent rare and extreme neighborhoods .",
    "most of the galaxy population in fact resides in the proverbial suburbs : relatively small galaxy groups containing anywhere between two to a few dozen significant members @xcite .",
    "groups influence on their member galaxies may be dramatic , like quenching star formation by keeping cold gas from reaching galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and/or triggering bursts of star formation through slower galaxy - galaxy interactions than clusters @xcite . in turn , the assembly of groups ( and the quenching processes therein ) since @xmath12 could be a major factor in the decline of the cosmic star formation rate over the same time period @xcite .    despite the ubiquity of groups , homogeneous samples are notoriously difficult to assemble beyond the nearby universe ( @xmath13 ) . since each group contains only a few galaxies spread over @xmath14 mpc or more , standard cluster selection techniques ( e.g. angular overdensities exhibiting a well - defined red sequence ) can not be applied .",
    "comprehensive spectroscopic surveys over wide areas are the only reliable way to weed out groups from interlopers ; however , at high redshifts optically - selected spectroscopic surveys are biased toward uv - bright , highly star - forming galaxies at the expense of the massive red galaxies which dominate dense environments .",
    "an _ infrared - selected _ survey , effectively producing a mass - limited sample at @xmath15 , is therefore necessary to produce an unbiased census of massive galaxies at these redshifts @xcite .",
    "the carnegie - spitzer - imacs ( csi ) survey , currently underway at the magellan - baade 6.5 m telescope in chile , has been specifically designed to characterize massive galaxies and their environments up to @xmath16 . here",
    "we present a measurement of the evolution of the _ group _ stellar mass function ( grsmf ) , to lower group masses and higher redshifts than has been previously achieved , using early data from csi .",
    "cosmological parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are assumed throughout .",
    "in a companion paper @xcite , we describe the csi observing setup and strategy , data reduction , and sed fitting ; a brief summary follows . we employ a simple @xmath3 m flux limit of @xmath20 to select galaxies from three of the spitzer wide - area extragalactic survey ( swire ) fields : elais - s1 , _ chandra _ deep field south , and xmm - large scale structure ( xmm - lss ) , excluding stars with simple optical / ir color cuts .",
    "the @xmath3 m band lies in the rest - frame near - ir for galaxies at @xmath21 , resulting in an approximately mass - selected sample unbiased by dust and star formation .",
    "the first two years of observations focused primarily on the xmm - lss field , giving it the best spectroscopic and photometric coverage at present ; here we focus only on data from this 5.3deg@xmath4 field in our analysis .",
    "targets were observed in multi - slit , nod - and - shuffle mode @xcite with a multiplexing efficiency of @xmath22 objects per @xmath23 diameter mask , using the low - dispersion prism ( ldp ) on the inamori - magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( imacs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in 2009 . in 2010 ,",
    "a second pass was mostly completed with the new uniform - dispersion prism ( udp ) which provides superior resolution beyond @xmath24 .",
    "some overlap between the ldp- and udp - observed samples was included for cross - calibration and testing ; overall , two passes have provided @xmath25% completeness .",
    "the imacs spectra are supplemented with moderate - depth @xmath26 and @xmath27 imaging from the noao extremely wide - field infrared mosaic ( newfirm ) and optical photometry from the public cfht legacy survey .",
    "the spectra were optimally extracted and combined , and prism and broadband ir data were jointly fit using a generalized set of starburst models described by @xcite . with a series of benchmarks  spectroscopic redshifts in this field ( vvds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , galaxies observed with both the ldp and udp , and comparing prism redshifts of physically associated galaxy pairs ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* )  we infer typical redshift uncertainties of @xmath28 at @xmath29 .",
    "notably , unlike photometric redshifts , these errors are comparable for red and blue galaxies since the prism spectrum pinpoints both the 4000  break and emission lines . after excluding objects with poor sed fits ( typically due to strong agn components , bad photometry , and/or incorrect slit placement )",
    "the final catalog contains about 37,000 galaxy redshifts over 5.3 deg@xmath4 , with an effective stellar mass limit of about @xmath30m@xmath2 at @xmath15 .",
    "groups typically appear as associations of two to a few tens of galaxies over an area of a few hundred projected kpc ; accurate redshifts and large areas are therefore critical to building robust group samples .",
    "we employ a simple friends - of - friends ( fof ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) algorithm to find groups in the csi catalog , limiting the sample to galaxies with @xmath32m@xmath2 , the csi mass limit for red galaxies at @xmath5 . even at the low end our redshift uncertainty ( @xmath33% ) is larger than the expected velocity dispersion of most virialized groups and clusters .",
    "redshift uncertainties were estimated ( using the techniques mentioned in section  [ sec_data ] ) as a function of @xmath34-band magnitude and the quadrature sum of each galaxy pair s @xmath35 uncertainties was adopted as the redshift linking length .",
    "we used a transverse linking length of @xmath36mpc ( matching the @xcite length of 1mpc for sdss groups ) .",
    "the mean group redshift was also adjusted as new members were added , and previous group members falling outside 1 @xmath37 from the new mean were removed from the group . in cases where the members of two groups overlapped , the two were merged into a single group , the linking length recalculated , and the membership adjusted accordingly .",
    "ultimately this iterative fof process found 1551 groups in the csi catalog containing a total of 4140 confirmed galaxies above the mass limit , or an estimated 13000 galaxies after correcting for incompleteness ( as described in the next section ) .",
    "this correction is somewhat larger than that implied by the mean completeness of @xmath38% @xcite , because groups and clusters are relatively dense environments that are difficult to sample with multislit spectroscopy .",
    "figure  [ fig_grpex ] shows a @xmath39 color image of one representative group at @xmath40 along with spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of its four confirmed members .",
    "these galaxies are circled in white in the image , and with this particular color scale appear to have consistent colors .",
    "three of the member galaxy seds look fairly similar , with primarily evolved stellar populations , while the fourth is blue and star forming .",
    "this illustrates the high fraction of massive evolved galaxies even in relatively poor groups at high redshifts .",
    "even with the redshift accuracy of csi , two effects will introduce serious biases if not taken into account : spurious groups introduced by projected alignments of galaxies , and group members not included in the sample due to the minimum slit spacing of imacs and yet - incomplete coverage .",
    "we correct for the latter effect by creating mock galaxy catalogs based on the target source density and flux distribution ( i.e. , that of all objects above the irac flux limit ) , and estimating the fraction of sources on which slits could be placed @xmath41 as a function of projected density . for a given region of the image , the underlying source number density",
    "is then approximated by @xmath42 .    to estimate the contribution of spurious groups due to chance projections , we assigned random redshifts to the galaxies in the sample ( keeping the same distribution of source densities ) and re - ran the group finding algorithm .",
    "not surprisingly , the likelihood of chance projections decreases with increasing group mass since a higher concentration of galaxies in a given region is more likely to be a `` true '' group or cluster ; this contamination fraction varies from 60% at the low end ( @xmath43 ) to 10% for groups an order of magnitude more massive ; over the full group sample the mean contaminant fraction is about 40% . we therefore only consider group stellar masses above @xmath44 , where the contribution from spurious groups is below 50% .",
    "the csi group catalog was conservatively selected from a galaxy sample which is complete to @xmath45 at @xmath46 for both red and blue galaxies .",
    "calculation of the grsmfs is therefore straightforward , simply a matter of summing the number of groups detected in mass and redshift bins and dividing by the effective survey volume ( taking into account area not covered due to gaps between masks , bright stars , etc . ) . above the adopted mass limit of groups above @xmath47 , there are 686 groups .",
    "we subdivided the sample into redshift bins @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "our cumulative grsmfs are binned such that the first ( highest - mass ) bin contains three galaxies , and the number of groups in each successively lower - mass bin is incremented by either one or a multiplicative factor of 1.1 , whichever is greater ; this provides a roughly constant binning in @xmath51 at low masses .",
    "finally , to correct for projection effects the grsmf of the previously - described `` randomized '' ( i.e. spurious ) groups was calculated the same way and subtracted .    to check the concordance of these grsmfs with those found in other studies at lower redshifts and higher masses , we adopted two complementary samples from the literature : the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) group catalog by @xcite , and massive x - ray selected clusters at @xmath52 and @xmath8 from the rosat all - sky and 400 degree ( 400d ) surveys @xcite .",
    "400d includes 36 clusters at @xmath8 and 49 at @xmath53 detected in 400 deg@xmath4 of _ rosat _ pspc observations and followed up with _ chandra _ to obtain total virial masses . to create a @xmath52 sample comparable to csi , we chose a highly - restricted subset of groups from the @xcite `` sample ii '' catalog with at least two galaxies of @xmath45 between @xmath54 ( the upper bound being the redshift where sdss is complete at these masses ) , and calculated the cumulative group mass function .",
    "in contrast , the 400d survey provides an x - ray selected cluster sample given in virial , not stellar , masses .",
    "we therefore recomputed their mass functions in terms of @xmath55 using the volumes in figure 11 of @xcite and transformed their virial masses to stellar masses with the @xcite relations .",
    "if the group masses have substantial uncertainties , the observed mass function will be biased toward larger masses ( due to the steepness of the grsmf ) .",
    "this effect is small for sdss and 400d , but significant for csi which has relatively large mass errors . to correct for this , we convolved the sdss mass function with csi s expected stellar mass error distribution , and thereby estimated the shift in the csi grsmf as a function of group stellar mass .",
    "all csi grsmfs were corrected accordingly , with a mass shift of @xmath33dex .",
    "figure  [ fig_mf ] shows the csi , sdss , and @xcite mass functions overplotted , all in terms of @xmath56 . as an additional check",
    ", we include the hiflugcs x - ray selected cluster mass function from @xcite , transforming their @xmath57 values to @xmath58 with relations given by @xcite ( which were specifically computed from hiflugcs ) .",
    "poisson errors are shown on the csi data points ; cosmic variance is not included , but using the @xcite cosmic variance calculator we estimate it will add an additional 10 - 20% ( greatest in the @xmath59 bin and at the highest masses ) to the number density uncertainty ; however , for the most part the poisson uncertainties dominate . despite the major selection differences ,",
    "the smfs of the @xmath52 optical and x - ray samples are in good agreement , suggesting that the adopted transformations from virial to stellar masses are reasonably robust .",
    "the effective upper mass limit of our grsmfs where we `` run out '' of volume are , in the realm of galaxy clusters , not particularly massive : at @xmath60m@xmath2 ( above which we only have 12 groups in our sample ) , in the literature they would typically be called `` rich groups '' or `` poor clusters . ''",
    "the lack of rich csi clusters is simply a result of the limited area covered by csi : while 5.3deg@xmath4 ( and the ultimate goal of 15deg@xmath4 ) is very large for a @xmath15 galaxy survey , the richest , most massive clusters are rare enough that much larger areas are needed to find significant numbers of them at low to intermediate redshifts .",
    "as noted in the previous section , such samples are provided by large x - ray surveys covering hundreds of square degrees ; here we have adopted the 400d survey @xcite as a principal comparison sample .",
    "figure  [ fig_mf ] shows that the cluster mass functions of @xcite ( transformed to stellar masses by the @xcite conversion factors ) not only pick up more or less where csi leaves off , but also represent a smooth continuation of the csi grsmfs to a factor @xmath61 higher mass .",
    "this is the first demonstration of the connection between group and cluster smfs at these high redshifts . while not a particularly surprising result , it provides further evidence that our observing strategy and group selection methods are robust , and that the groups found by csi bridge a key gap between individual galaxies and massive clusters in the distribution of dark matter halos .",
    "although deep x - ray and ir observations provide compelling evidence of massive clusters at @xmath62 @xcite , no _ homogeneously - selected _ sample currently exists at these redshifts ; indeed , the rapid decline in cluster abundances at high stellar masses seen in figure  [ fig_mf ] ( if it is similarly steep at @xmath63 ) suggests that such objects are extremely rare .",
    "the most common progenitors of low-@xmath64 clusters must therefore lie at group masses at @xmath62 .",
    "the combined csi and 400d mass functions show strong evolution over the redshift range @xmath65 , with much of the evolution occurring between the @xmath15 and @xmath66 redshift bins .",
    "similarly , there s another significant increase in number density between the lowest - redshift bin of csi and the @xmath9 groups and clusters . in the two lowest - redshift csi bins",
    "there appears to be only marginal evolution between the mass functions ; this may be a result of cosmic variance or residual mass uncertainties .",
    "overall , however , the observed evolution appears to qualitatively reflect hierarchical structure formation : the ranks of massive groups and clusters ( @xmath67 ) grow strongly over this redshift interval , while the number density of lower - mass groups is more constant ( presumably because new groups are formed from below our mass limit as others merge into the more massive clusters ) .",
    "although these hierarchical trends can be seen in the 400d cluster data alone , csi and sdss demonstrate that this growth continues to masses @xmath33dex lower .    due to the small number of high - mass clusters , the mass functions in figure  [ fig_mf ] are shown as cumulative number densities . to better illustrate the observed hierarchical growth , another projection of the grsmf evolution",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig_mbins ] . here",
    "the number densities of galaxies in three mass bins ( two from csi / sdss and one from 400d ) are shown as a function of redshift .",
    "the difference between low- and high - mass groups is striking : at @xmath68 the abundance of groups is relatively flat , but at masses @xmath69dex higher the number density declines far more rapidly with increasing redshift .",
    "more quantiatively , we fit a power - law @xmath70 and find @xmath71 for groups with @xmath72 and @xmath73 at @xmath74 ; the difference in slopes is therefore significant at the @xmath75 level .",
    "x - ray clusters may exhibit marginally faster growth ( @xmath76 ) , but due to the large uncertainties and potential systematics in their estimated stellar masses we can not determine whether this steepening trend continues to @xmath77 .",
    "by employing low - resolution prism spectroscopy to obtain accurate redshifts for a mass - complete galaxy sample over 5.3deg@xmath4 , we have assembled the most comprehensive catalog of 686 galaxy groups down to a stellar mass limit of @xmath78m@xmath2 and up to redshifts @xmath5 .",
    "the csi grsmfs follow a smooth continuation of the x - ray selected cluster mass functions of @xcite when these are transformed to stellar masses .",
    "most notably , the number density of high - mass groups and clusters increases more rapidly than low - mass groups ; since the galaxies in these objects exhibit little ongoing star formation , hierarchical buildup through mergers and accretion must dominate their growth .",
    "this result illustrates the power of large prism surveys like csi to effectively bridge the gap between galaxy- and cluster - mass halos , allowing studies of an ubiquitous galaxy environment . as noted before , this result",
    "is based on an early sample comprising about one - third of the total csi area and 25% of the expected spectra .",
    "while these early data provide a qualitative picture of hierarchical growth in group stellar mass , forthcoming csi data which attain improved completeness over the full 15deg@xmath4 area will allow us to robustly track the stellar - mass growth of groups and clusters , and for the first time directly test theoretical models in the gap between galaxy and cluster - mass dark matter halos . additionally , deep x - ray observations ( and/or stacks of existing shallower data ) in the csi fields will allow a direct comparison of stellar and virial masses for x - ray detected groups , providing an unprecedented window into the underlying halo growth .",
