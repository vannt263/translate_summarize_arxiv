    "the cresst dark matter search utilizes cawo@xmath0 targets and readout scintillation and phonon signal to discriminate between recoil types .",
    "the advantage of reading out both phonon and ionization ( or scintillation ) signals comes about from the differing ratios of ionization and phonon energy or scintillation and phonon energy created in electron- and nuclear - recoils in the detectors .",

    "however there are other relevant materials in use such as calcium tungstate ( cawo@xmath0 ) which leads to a small loss of generality .      the cryogenic dark matter search  @xcite utilizes silicon and germanium detectors to search for weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) dark matter  @xcite candidates .",
    "the silicon or germanium nuclei provide a target mass for wimp - nucleon interactions .",
    "simultaneous measurement of both phonon energy and ionization energy provide a powerful discriminator between electron - recoil interactions and nuclear - recoil interactions .",
    "background radiation primarily interacts through electron - recoils whereas a wimp signal would interact through nuclear - recoils .",

    "low energy gamma - rays ( x - rays ) predominantly interact via photoelectric absorption in which all of the gamma - ray energy is deposited in a single interaction location .",
    "high energy gamma - rays interact via compton scattering in which some of the gamma - ray s initial energy is transferred to an electron and the gamma - ray continues along a different trajectory with reduced energy",
    ". the gamma - ray will generally continue to scatter until it leaves the detector volume or terminates with a photoelectric absorption . in silicon ( germanium ) , for photon energies greater than 60 ( 160 )  kev",
    ", compton scattering dominates  @xcite .",
    "both of these electron interactions result in a high energy electron being produced which then undergoes a rapid cascade process resulting in a large number of electron - hole pairs  @xcite .",
    "this initial cascade process ceases around the scale of the mean electron - hole pair creation energy ( @xmath3 ) resulting in an expected number of electron - hole pair @xmath4 . due to correlations in the cascade process ,",

    "there are important screening and velocity dependent cross sections in both energy loss lengths  @xcite but to first approximation these equations show the velocity dependent competition in the two scattering rates .",
    "whichever interaction occurs first , there is generally a cascade of many scattering events resulting in a larger amount of energy being deposited in the ion lattice compared to gamma - ray interactions . for historical reasons",
    ", the reduced amount of energy in the electron - hole ( ionization ) system , compared to an equal energy deposition by a gamma - ray , has brought about the term _ nuclear quenching _ to describe the reduced ionization signal .",

    "beta radiation represents another class of electron - recoil interactions .",
    "the attenuation lengths are much shorter , however , resulting in a class of events sometimes referred to as _ surface interactions_. these surface interactions can result in signals that differ from bulk events of the same energy and electron- / nuclear - recoil type .",

    "they are excitations which , in the lattice , and in materials sufficiently cooled that charge carriers are frozen out , mediate thermal transport .",

    "phonons are simply treated as non interacting particles with decay and mass defect scattering properties described in the remainder of this chapter . in general",
    "they have a nonlinear dispersion relationship ; however , due to rapid down conversion to lower frequencies they spend most of their time in an energy region with linear dispersion relationship . hence",
    ", a linear dispersion relation is sufficient for phonon transport modeling in these detectors .      immediately after the recoil , a population of prompt phonons exist in the immediate vicinity of the interaction point .",
    "particular details of the frequency distribution and mode population are not well known but we can make a few deductions , explained in more detail in the following sections , that will lead us an initial distribution for monte carlo .",
    "anharmonic decay , due to nonlinear terms in the elastic coupling between adjacent lattice ions , causes the phonons to rapidly down convert into a lower frequency distribution .",
    "this process allows us to start a monte carlo with any high frequency distribution and details of the distribution will rapidly be lost ; we use the debye frequency as a naive starting point . isotope scattering , which also occurs at a high rate for a high frequency phonons , causes the phonons to obtain their equilibrium mode density ; we use the equilibrium mode density as a naive starting point .",
    "the approximations are good in the sense that the detector s phonon response is insensitive to variations in the distributions .",
    "they are valid since the detectors are large compared to the initial characteristic interaction lengths of phonons .",
    "furthermore , later generations of phonons are ballistic and timing information in the measured phonon pulses is determined by the detector geometry and the loss rate of phonons at surfaces .",

    "it is usually again easiest to tune this probability by running numerous monte carlo and identifying the best fit value . in the cdms detector",

    "for any well designed detector , phonon absorption into the instrumentation sensors will dominate over other loss processes allowing the probability to be tuned by matching pulse decay times .",
    "it would be grossly inefficient to run all phonons with the same time step .",
    "therefore we generate scattering times according to the distributions in sections  [ sect : isotopescatter ] and  [ sect : anharmonicdecay ] . the scattering and decay probabilities go like @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a combination of isotope scattering and anharmonic decay rates as given by matthiessen s rule @xmath101 .",
    "this scattering time has to be compared with the time that the phonon will take to interact with a surface and the event that occurs soonest will be chosen for each individual phonon .",
    "if it is determined that the bulk interaction time is less than the surface interaction time , then it must be determined which event occurs based on their relative , frequency dependent rates .",
    "this can be done by drawing a uniform random number @xmath102 and comparing the rate of the process in question to the total rate .",

    "there are times when a pdf can not be analytically integrated to yield a cdf or the cdf can not be inverted .",
