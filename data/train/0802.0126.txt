    "this three - atom vdw potential was calculated first in the nonretarded limit by pursuing the perturbation calculation to the third order @xcite , and then for arbitrary interatomic distances , by using sixth - order perturbation calculation @xcite .",
    "later on , a general formula for the non - additive @xmath3-atom vdw potential was derived by summing up the response of each atom to the quantized field caused by the other atoms @xcite and by calculating the difference in the zero - point energy of the electromagnetic field of a large cavity with and without the atoms @xcite .",
