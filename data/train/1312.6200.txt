    "in the early 1950 s , brookhaven national laboratory began compiling and archiving nuclear reaction experimental data in the scisrs database @xcite . over the years",
    ", this project have grown and evolved into the exfor project @xcite .",
    "exfor is an international experimental nuclear data collection and dissemination project now led by the iaea nuclear data section , coordinating the experimental nuclear data compilation and archival work of several nations .",
    "the exfor nuclear experimental database provides the data which underpins nearly all evaluated neutron and charged particle evaluations in endf - formatted nuclear data libraries ( e.g. endf / b , jeff , jendl , ... ) .",
    "therefore , exfor is in many ways the `` mother library '' which leads to the nuclear data used in all applications in nuclear power , security , nuclear medicine , etc .",
    "the exfor database includes a complete compilation of experimental neutron - induced , a selected compilation of charged - particle - induced , a selected compilation of photon - induced , and assorted high - energy and heavy - ion reaction data .",
    "the exfor library is the most comprehensive collection of experimental nuclear data available .",
    "therefore , it is the best place to look for an overview of what the applied and basic experimental nuclear science communities feel are valuable experimental reactions and quantities.@xcite    the basic unit of exfor is an entry .",
    "an entry corresponds to one experiment and contains the numerical data , the related bibliographic information and a brief description of the experimental method . what an exfor entry really represents is the results of work that was performed at a given laboratory at a given time .",
    "an entry does not necessarily correspond to one particular publication , but very often corresponds to several publications .",
    "the exfor compiler takes the essential information from all available sources , and if needed , contacts the author for more information .",
    "an entry is typically divided in several subents containing the data tables resulting from the experiment .",
    "each subent contains a reaction field which encodes what reaction was studied ( e.g. @xmath0h(@xmath1,el ) ) and what quantity was measured ( e.g. cross - section or angular distribution ) .",
    "a subent may also contain a monitor field which encodes one or more well characterized reactions and quantities used to reduce or eliminate systematic experimental errors .",
    "thus , reaction monitors are an important part of experimental data reduction .",
    "often the measured data encoded in the reaction field is measured relative to the reaction / quantity encoded in the monitor field .",
    "there is usually a straightforward mapping between the reactions / quantities measured in exfor and the evaluated reactions / quantities stored in the endf libraries .",
    "several specific reaction / quantities are important enough , usually because of one or more specific applications , that the nuclear data community has elevated them to the level of an international reference standard .",
    "many experimenters use these reaction / quantities as monitors in their experiments .",
    "references @xcite provide details of well known neutron - induced , charged - particle and photonuclear standard reaction / quantities .",
    "we divided these references into two different classes .",
    "we define tier 1 observables as the product of sustained evaluation efforts , with periodic refinement .",
    "our tier 1 standards include the evaluations from the endf / b neutron standards @xcite project and the _ atlas of neutron resonances _ @xcite .",
    "our second tier encompasses standards that are of very high quality but are not performed as part of a sustained project .",
    "there may be follow ups or limited refinements .",
    "this second tier includes medical and dosimitry evaluations in ref . @xcite and the results of the irdff project @xcite .",
    "there is also a new tier 1 standards - level effort just beginning known as cielo pilot project @xcite .",
    "cielo promises to generate entire standards - level evaluations including all reactions / quantities needed for the endf - formatted libraries for neutron - induced reactions on @xmath2h , @xmath3o , @xmath4fe , @xmath5u , @xmath6u and @xmath7pu .",
    "when undertaking this project we specifically set out with the goal of answering some important questions .",
    "* what are the most connected targets ?",
    "what are the most connected reactions / quantities ? * are there reactions / quantities that are so connected that they should be a standard ? * what is the connection number distribution for targets and reactions ? what is the link number distribution between any two targets ? * can we use this information to inform new measurements that decrease the distance between important targets and standards ? * are there `` bottlenecks '' along the pathways from a given reaction to reaction standards that are not well measured ? * what elements and isotopes of reactions are not linked ?",
    "are any of them important for specific applications ?    in order to attempt to resolve these questions we utilized graph theory as a tool to examine the connections between measurements in exfor .    in this work",
    ", we take an abstract view of the exfor database and generate an undirected graph describing all the connections between reactions / quantities in the exfor database . from just these connections",
    ", we can infer what reactions / quantities the nuclear science community collectively ( and somewhat unconsciously ) views as important .",
    "this set of reactions / quantities does not exactly match our previous expectations .",
    "we will provide a series of recommendations for reactions / quantities that should be considered for elevation to the level of the standards in references @xcite or possibly included in a follow - on cielo project .",
    "we also find that our graph is disconnected , implying there are large numbers of reactions / quantities that are not pinned to any monitor . in many cases ,",
    "this is due to poor coding of the exfor entrys .",
    "although this is a serious problem in our study , there is no easy fix .",
    "even if additional information is given , it is often given in one of the free text fields in exfor which are difficult , if not impossible , to parse .",
    "we used the x4i code @xcite to read the exfor database and parse the reaction and monitor strings .",
    "we then built up the undirected graph within x4i and stored the resulting graph in a graphml formatted file . in this section",
    "we detail how we construct the graph .",
    ".[table : nodes]types of nodes in our graph . [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "it is clear from the analysis above that the following reaction / quantities have out - sized importance as measured by several different metrics :    * aluminum reaction / quantities : * * n+@xmath8al : the ( @xmath9 mg ) cross section * * p+@xmath8al : the ( @xmath10 ) cross section and the @xmath11na and @xmath12na production cross sections * * @xmath13c+@xmath8al : the @xmath12na production cross section * molybdinum is also a very important structural material : * * p+@xmath14mo : the @xmath15tc production cross section * * @xmath16 + @xmath14mo : the @xmath17ru production cross section    all of these nodes reside in the main cluster of our graph so we ask    * how are nodes in the main cluster connected to the tier 1 and 2 standards ? * can we improve this connectivity with the nodes we have identified as important ?",
    "the simplest measure of graph connectivity is the mean distance between nodes .",
    "the distance between any two connected nodes is the minimum number of edges separating the nodes including all possible paths between the nodes .",
    "here we are not interested in the distance between arbitrary nodes but are interested in the distance between any node and a tier 1 or 2 standard node . in figure",
    "[ figure : distancedist ] we show several histograms of distance from nodes to the nearest standards node for several cases .    in this plot ,",
    "nodes with distance zero are the standards themselves .",
    "considering just the tier 1 standards , the distribution is rather broad and peaks at a distance of 5 nodes and extends to 10 nodes .",
    "we note that this peak is near @xmath18 , the average path length in the main cluster .",
    "the main cluster is a `` small world '' graph , so it has tight clusters within that can be used to increase connectivity , like the hubs of an airline network . adding in the large number of tier 2 standards",
    "dramatically tightens up the distribution with the peak now at 2 the distribution now extends to 8 nodes . as we saw earlier",
    ", many of these tier 2 standards have high degree and can function as hubs . adding the nodes corresponding to our proposed list of nodes tightens the distribution up further , enhancing the connectivity to standards level nodes .",
    "we comment that there is a noticeable improvement from adding our seven proposed nodes , a surprisingly large improvement given the small number of added nodes .",
    "plot of the minimum distance to a standard .",
    "we show a line at the average path length for the main cluster @xmath19 .",
    "this is the cluster where all of the standards nodes reside.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in this project , we created an undirected graph from the reaction and monitor strings from datasets in the exfor database .",
    "this graph is a large , nearly scale - free network composed of disconnected clusters .",
    "the largest clusters have a `` small - world '' character .",
    "our graph is in many ways typical for real world graphs .    with our graph",
    ", we identify what reactions and quantities the nuclear science community views as important enough to directly measure or measure relative to .",
    "we do this in a relatively objective fashion . clearly the various standards projects in refs . @xcite have a good handle on what is important .",
    "also , the clustering coefficients in table [ table : topbyclustercoeff ] demonstrate how connected the cielo nodes are .",
    "however , it is clear from the analysis of our graph that the following reaction / quantities have out - sized importance and are not considered in any standards effort :    * aluminum reaction / quantities : * * n+@xmath8al : the ( @xmath9 mg ) cross section * * p+@xmath8al : the ( @xmath10 ) cross section and the @xmath11na and @xmath12na production cross sections * * @xmath13c+@xmath8al : the @xmath12na production cross section * molybdinum also a very important structural material : * * p+@xmath14mo : the @xmath15tc production cross section * * @xmath16 + @xmath14mo : the @xmath17ru production cross section    we recommend that at the very least that @xmath8al and all of the mo isotopes be considered as a target material in either a follow - on cielo or irdff project .",
    "in addition , a standards level study of fission product yields of the major actinides as suggested in the discussions at the recent working party on evaluation cooperation subgroup 37 meeting @xcite would improve the connectivity of all fission product yield data .",
