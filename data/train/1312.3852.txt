    "<S> we find that the mechanism works best when both perturbations are on the same sublattice . due to the nature of the coupling between the a and b sublattice and the fact that the localized perturber states live ( mostly ) on one sublattice </S>",
    "<S> , signal propagation between perturbations on different sublattices takes place over a much longer timescale .    _ </S>",
    "<S> discussion. _ continuous - time quantum search can be performed effectively on a 2d lattice without internal degrees of freedom by running the search at the dirac point in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> we find that our search succeeds in time @xmath102 with probability @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the same time complexity found in @xcite for discrete - time and in @xcite for continuous - time searches . to boost the probability to @xmath104 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath105 repetitions are required giving a total time @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> amplification methods @xcite may be used to reduce the total search time further .    for simplicity of the analysis , </S>",
    "<S> we have focused here on perturbations which alter the hopping potential to all three nearest - neighbors symmetrically . </S>",
    "<S> efficient search algorithms can also be obtained using other types of perturbations such as a single - bond perturbation or perturbing the lattice by adding additional sites . in all cases , </S>",
    "<S> it is important to fine - tune the system parameters in order to operate at an avoided crossing near the dirac point . given the importance of graphene as a nano - material , our findings point towards applications in directed signal transfer , state reconstruction or sensitive switching . </S>",
    "<S> this opens up the possibility of a completely new type of electronic engineering using single atoms as building blocks of electronic devices .    </S>",
    "<S> this work has been supported by the epsrc network ` analysis on graphs ' ( ep / i038217/1 ) . </S>",
