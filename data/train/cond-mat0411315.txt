    "the foundations of bosonization were laid more than 50 years ago in a seminal paper by tomonaga @xcite . during the following decades",
    "the method was worked out and successfully applied to one - dimensional electron and spin systems @xcite . despite its long history",
    "there are still some subtle points in the bosonization formalism which are not taken into consideration in the majority of the literature .",
    "one of these is the proper treatment of the so - called klein factors which have to be introduced in order to preserve the anticommuting property of the fermionic fields during the bosonization procedure .",
    "the role of the klein factors deserves particular attention when nonlinear perturbations arising e.g.  from impurity scattering or lattice modulations are to be considered in finite systems .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate how to handle the klein factors in a systematic way , both in the thermodynamic limit and for finite systems . as a prototypical model we study the one - dimensional dimerized hubbard model where the hopping is periodically modulated due to the peierls distortion of the lattice .",
    "we extend the self - consistent harmonic approximation @xcite by treating bosonic fields and klein factors on equal footing @xcite . as an application we use the formalism to calculate spin and charge gaps of this model .",
    "we consider the dimerized hubbard model @xmath0 which differs from the ordinary one - dimensional hubbard model by a periodic modulation of the hopping described by the dimerization parameter @xmath1 .",
    "this modulation is relevant in one dimension due to the coupling between the lattice and the electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "a finite @xmath1 corresponds to a periodic lattice distortion known as peierls instability .",
    "we study the case of half - filling , and have chosen the modulation accordingly to be of the form @xmath2 .",
    "the quantity @xmath1 is considered to be a parameter of the model .",
    "@xmath3 creates an electron with spin direction @xmath4 at site @xmath5 , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the hopping matrix element and the on - site hubbard interaction , respectively .    in the following we list the main steps which have to be performed in order to bosonize the hamiltonian ( [ phmodel ] ) . for more details",
    "we refer the reader to the reviews @xcite .",
    "first we represent @xmath8 in momentum space : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "we linearize the spectrum around the two fermi points @xmath12 ,  @xmath13 , and introduce left and right moving fermions labeled by @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "this allows us to sort the various scattering processes according to their initial and final states (  g - ology \" )",

    "returning to real space we define the bosonic fields @xmath23 which are related to the fermionic field operators via the bosonization identities @xmath24 where @xmath25 counts the particle number with respect to the filled fermi sea , and @xmath14 is the length of the system .. nevertheless we retain @xmath14 and @xmath11 for easy reference . ] the klein factors @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) are unitary operators that commute with the bosonic fields .",

    "( [ umklapp ] )  ( [ peierls ] ) we have used @xmath53 at half filling .",
    "the parameter @xmath54 is a short - distance cutoff of the order of the lattice spacing , i.e.  of order one",
    ". the luttinger parameters @xmath55 and the charge and spin velocities @xmath56 can either be calculated perturbatively or from the bethe ansatz solution of the hubbard model @xcite . in the following we focus on the role of the klein factors . in the literature",
    "it is common practice either to ignore them or to replace them by majorana fermions @xcite .",
    "it is argued that the latter approach  which neglects the number changing property of the klein factors  should be justified in the thermodynamic limit . in the following we aim to present a more rigorous approach .",
    "due to the conservation of charge and spin all combinations of klein factors appearing in the hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) can be expressed in terms of the operators @xmath57 and @xmath58 plus their hermitean conjugates . in particular , the four - fermion terms arising from umklapp and backscattering read @xmath59 since the klein factors are unitary , @xmath60 , it is easy to show that @xmath61 = [ a_{{\\downarrow}},a_{{\\downarrow}}^+ ] = 0 \\;\\ ; , \\ ] ] and we may choose a basis where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are both diagonal . from @xmath64",
    "one concludes that the eigenvalues of @xmath62 are pure phase factors , i.e.@xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "the terms @xmath67 appearing in @xmath44 do not commute with the klein factors ; however it appears reasonable to neglect them in the thermodynamic limit @xmath68 .",
    "we will come back to this question in sec .",
    "we thus replace the klein factors in @xmath69 and @xmath50 by their eigenvalues , and obtain @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 as a result the hamiltonian of the dimerized hubbard model separates into different sectors of purely bosonic hamiltonians which are labeled by @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "note that when replacing klein factors by majorana fermions @xcite one obtains only the eigenvalues @xmath75 for the two - fermion terms and @xmath29 for the four - fermion terms , i.e.continuity is lost . shifting the field operators according to @xmath76 ,",

    "( [ varphi ] ) , has to be replaced by @xmath79",
    "in order to study the charge and spin gaps in the dimerized hubbard model we use the self - consistent harmonic approximation ( scha ) in which the exponentials of field operators appearing in ( [ umklapp1 ] )  ( [ peierls1 ] ) are replaced by quadratic forms .",
    "we introduce the trial hamiltonian @xmath80 which provides us with a variational estimate for the ground state energy @xmath81 here the expectation value is with respect to the ground state of @xmath82 , @xmath83 is its ground state energy , and @xmath84 with @xmath85 minimizing @xmath86 with respect to @xmath87 and @xmath88 yields the gap equations @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the minimum of @xmath91 ( see table 1 ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to solve these equations analytically we consider the case @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and restrict ourselves to the limit of small dimerization @xmath1 . since @xmath82 is quadratic in the bosonic fields it is straightforward to calculate @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a cutoff - dependent energy scale of the order of the bandwidth , and @xmath97 is assumed . for nonzero dimerization @xmath98",
    "the solutions of the gap equations lie in the range @xmath99 ; thus the second line of table 1 with @xmath100 and @xmath101 has to be used in eqs .",
    "( [ gapequation1 ] ) , ( [ gapequation2 ] ) . for @xmath102",
    "the spin gap vanishes while the charge gap approaches a constant according to @xcite @xmath103 with cutoff - dependent prefactors .",
    "the exponent @xmath104 that characterizes the spin gap is in accordance with the corresponding exponent of the dimerized antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain up to a logarithmic correction in the prefactor @xcite .",
    "since the heisenberg model corresponds to the @xmath105 limit of the half - filled hubbard model , this indicates that as far as the exponent is concerned the scha result ( [ spingap ] ) is exact and persists even in the strong - coupling regime @xmath106 .",
    "for @xmath107 the behavior of the gaps is changed to @xcite @xmath108 where the crossover value @xmath109 is defined by @xmath110 . in fig .",
    "1 we show @xmath111 and @xmath112 as a function of @xmath1 for @xmath113 as obtained from the numerical solution of the gap equations . for comparison ,",
    "the analytical results ( [ chargegap ] ) and ( [ spingap ] ) are also given .",
    "for a finite system of length @xmath14 it is not possible to simply replace the klein factors by their eigenvalues since the terms @xmath114 in the luttinger hamiltonian ( [ luttinger ] ) do not commute with the @xmath115 .",
    "however one may decouple the klein factors from the bosonic fields using a variational ansatz . to this end",
    "we introduce the  klein hamiltonian \" @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are variational parameters to be determined self - consistently .",
    "@xmath119 is of the form of a tight - binding hamiltonian for a particle moving on a @xmath120 lattice in a harmonic potential .",
    "a class of similar hamiltonians for general potentials in @xmath121 has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the choice of the trial hamiltonian is equivalent to a decoupling of the non - linearities according to @xmath122 and analogously for the umklapp and dimerization term .",
    "this means that instead of replacing the products of klein factors by their _ eigenvalues _ as in the thermodynamic limit , we now have to replace them by their _ expectation values _ with respect to the ground state of @xmath119 . in both cases",
    "one ends up with a sine - gordon type model like the one explicitly given in eq .",
    "( [ sine_gordon ] ) .",
    "it is conceivable that for a finite - size system the eigenvalues are not identical to the expectation values , i.e.  different sine - gordon models arise .",
    "the question is then whether identical sine - gordon models arise at least in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we can answer this question within the framework of the scha . here",
    "the introduction of the  klein hamiltonian \" amounts to replacing the quantity @xmath123 which enters the gap equations ( and which is explicitly given in table 1 ) by the ground state energy of @xmath119 .",
    "apart from this modification eqs .",
    "( [ bdef ] )  ( [ gapequation2 ] ) remain unchanged . consider first a system with both a spin and a charge gap . for large systems the parameters @xmath118 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 become size - independent , with the consequence that the kinetic energy in @xmath119 dominates the confining potential .",
    "the ground state energy of @xmath119 is then given by the minimum of @xmath126 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq26 ] ) , and expectation values of the klein factors are equal to their eigenvalues .    in the absence of dimerization ,",
    "i.e.  for the  pure \" hubbard model , we encounter a different situation since the spin gap vanishes",
    ". for large system size one finds @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 .",
    "thus the confining potential in the spin sector dominates the corresponding kinetic energy ( proportional to @xmath125 ) in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "hence the ground state of @xmath119 is the eigenstate of the current operator with @xmath130 , and the expectation value of the operator @xmath131 in this state is zero , in contrast to the eigenvalues which are @xmath132 , see eqs .",
    "( [ fourterms ] )  ( [ eq20 ] ) .",
    "we studied the role of klein factors for the bosonized hamiltonian of the dimerized hubbard model . since the klein operators do not commute with the total spin and charge currents",
    "@xmath133 they can not acquire a definite value at the same time as the current operators .",
    "the ground state of the gapped system is a superposition of many spin and charge states . in this situation",
    "it is justified to choose a fixed phase for the klein operators .",
    "the bosonized hamiltonian is then the conventional sine - gordon - like hamiltonian , cf .",
    "( [ sine_gordon ] ) . in an ungapped system",
    "where the non - linearities introduced by backscattering are ( marginally ) irrelevant operators , the ground state has a well defined current . in this case",
    "the phase of the klein operators is undetermined and eq .",
    "( [ sine_gordon ] ) has no justification .",
    "we have extended the self - consistent harmonic approximation in such a way that klein factors can be handled systematically , and we worked out the theory for the hubbard model . in a previous paper @xcite we applied the scha to spinless fermions with nearest - neighbor interaction and dimerization , and studied in detail finite - size effects . in the spinless case",
    "the klein hamiltonian @xmath119 can be mapped onto a mathieu equation which can be solved analytically in certain limits .",
    "it turns out that finite - size corrections to the gap equation are not important as long as the dimerization gap is larger than the finite - size gap .",
    "in addition , the finite - size formalism allows to calculate the size - dependence of the drude weight in the gapped regime @xcite .",
