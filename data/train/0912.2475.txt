    "the ads / cft correspondence has become a powerful tool in studying strongly coupled phenomena in quantum field theory using results from a weakly coupled gravity background . according to this correspondence principle  @xcite , a string theory on asymptotically ads spacetimes can be related to a conformal field theory on the boundary . in recent years , apart from string theory , this holographic correspondence , following a more phenomenological approach , has also been applied to condensed matter physics and in particular to superconductivity .",
    "it was first suggested in @xcite that near the horizon of a charged black hole there is in operation a geometrical mechanism parametrized by a charged scalar field of breaking a local @xmath5 gauge symmetry .",
    "then it was suggested to use the gauge / gravity duality to construct gravitational duals of the transition from normal to superconducting states in the boundary theory @xcite .",
    "the gravity dual of a superconductor consists of a system with a black hole and a charged scalar field , in which the black hole admits scalar hair at temperature smaller than a critical temperature , while there is no scalar hair at larger temperatures  @xcite . a condensate of the charged scalar field is formed through its coupling to a maxwell field of the background .",
    "neither field is backreacting on the metric . considering fluctuations of the vector potential , the frequency",
    "dependent conductivity was calculated , and it was shown that it develops a gap determined by the condensate .",
    "this model was further studied beyond the probe limit  @xcite . along this line ,",
    "there have been a lot of investigations concerning the application of ads / cft correspondence to condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "@xcite for reviews .",
    "these models however are phenomenological models .",
    "the classical fields and their interactions are chosen by hand .",
    "it would have also been desirable that these models emerge from a consistent string theory  @xcite .",
    "also recently there is an effort to discuss stringy effects coming from higher dimensions .",
    "the various condensates were studied in ( 2 + 1 ) and in ( 3 + 1 ) superconductors @xcite .",
    "it was found that there is a universal relation between the gap @xmath6 in the frequency dependent conductivity and the critical temperature @xmath7 : @xmath8 respected to a good approximation by all cases considered .    motivated by the application of the mermin - wagner theorem to the holographic superconductors there was a study of the effects of the curvature corrections on the @xmath9-dimensional superconductor @xcite .",
    "a model of a charged scalar field together with a maxwell field in the five - dimensional gauss - bonnet - ads black hole background was presented .",
    "it was found that higher curvature corrections make condensation harder and cause the behavior of the ratio @xmath8 which was claimed to be universal in @xcite unstable .",
    "they presented a semi - analytic approximation method to explain the qualitative features of superconductors giving fairly good agreement with numerical results .    in this work",

    "our aim is to clarify the influence of the stringy effects on holographic superconductors in various dimensions .    in the case of @xmath0-dimensional gauss - bonnet - ads black hole background , besides the study of the influence the mass of the scalar field and gauss - bonnet coupling have on the formation of the scalar condensation , we will also present an analysis of the effects the dimensionality of the ads space have on the scalar condensation formation .",
    "we applied the semi - analytical method in matching the approximate solutions near the horizon and the asymptotic ads region @xcite for @xmath10 .",
    "we find that for @xmath11 the method breaks down unless the matching point is selected in an appropriate range .",
    "we also study the ratio @xmath1 for various mass of the scalar field and gauss - bonnet coupling .",
    "the ads soliton is a gravitational configuration which has lower energy than the ads space in the poincare coordinates , but has the same boundary topology as the ricci flat black hole and the ads space in the poincare coordinates @xcite .",
    "it was found that there is a hawking - page phase transition between the ricci flat ads black hole and the ads soliton @xcite .",
    "the signature of this phase transition shows up in the quasi - normal modes spectrum @xcite .",
    "more recently the hawking - page phase transition between ricci flat black holes and deformed ads soliton in the gauss - bonnet gravity was discussed in @xcite .",
    "it was argued that although in gauss - bonnet gravity , the black hole solution and ads soliton are greatly deformed by the gauss - bonnet term , the gauss - bonnet coefficient disappears in the euclidean action and as a result the gauss - bonnet term has no effect on the hawking - page phase transition .",
    "recently it was found that there is a superconducting phase dual to an ads soliton configuration @xcite .",
    "we will extend the construction to include a ricci flat ads soliton in gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "we will study the effects of the mass of the scalar field and the gauss - bonnet coupling on the scalar condensation and conductivity and compare them with the corresponding results in gauss - bonnet - ads black hole configuration .",

    ". we can impose boundary conditions that either @xmath45 or @xmath46 vanish . as was noted in  @xcite imposing boundary conditions in which both @xmath45 and @xmath46 are non - zero makes the asymptotic ads theory unstable  @xcite .",
    "in the case of flat schwarzschild - ads black hole background , the scalar operators @xmath50 and @xmath51 have different behaviors at low temperatures  @xcite . while the condensate @xmath51 have similar behavior to the bcs theory , the condensate @xmath50 diverges at low temperatures . as it was shown in  @xcite this result",
    "was obtained because the backreaction on the metric was neglected . in this section",
    "we will present a detailed analysis of the condensation of these operators which are subjected to curvature corrections .",
    "a study of the condensation of the scalar operator @xmath51 in five - dimensional gauss - bonnet - ads black hole background was carried out in @xcite .",
    "it was found that for fixed mass of the scalar field to a value of @xmath52 , the increase of the gauss - bonnet coupling @xmath53 results in the decrease of the critical temperature so that the higher curvature corrections make it harder for the scalar field to condense . this can be understood invoking the arguments presented in @xcite .",
    "the scalar hair can be formed just outside the horizon because the electromagnetic repulsion of the charged scalar field can overcome the gravitational attraction , resulting in the condensation of the scalar field bouncing off the ads boundary . in our case because of the strong curvature effects outside the horizon this mechanism is less effective .",
