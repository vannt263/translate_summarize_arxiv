    "a formulation of general relativity called teleparallel equivalent of general relativity ( tegr ) has not been yet used as a starting point for a quantization of gravity @xcite . since",
    "nowadays no existing approach to quantum gravity seems to be fully successful it is worth to check whether it is possible to construct a model of quantum gravity based on tegr . in this paper",
    "we will address an issue of constructing a space of quantum states for tegr which could be applied in the procedure of canonical ( or a canonical - like ) quantization of the theory .",
    "a hamiltonian analysis of tegr @xcite shows that it is a constrained system .",
    "since we do not expect that constraints on the phase space of tegr can be solved classically we would like to apply the dirac s approach to canonical quantization of constrained systems . according to this approach one first constructs a space of kinematic quantum states , that is , quantum states which correspond to classical states constituting the unconstrained phase space , next among kinematic quantum states one distinguishes physical quantum states as those corresponding to classical states which satisfy all constraints .",
    "thus our goal is to construct a space of kinematic quantum states for tegr .",
    "since tegr is a background independent theory it is desirable to construct a space of quantum states for it in a background independent manner .",
    "methods which provide a construction of this sort are known from loop quantum gravity ( lqg)see e.g. @xcite and references therein  but because of a reason explained below they are rather not applicable to tegr .",
    "therefore we are going to construct the desired space for tegr by means of a general method @xcite deliberately developed for this purpose .",
    "this method works as follows .",
    "the starting point for the method is a phase space of a theory of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a space of momenta , and @xmath2 is a ( hamiltonian ) configuration space ( that is , a space of `` positions '' ) .",
    "one starts the construction by choosing a set @xmath3 of real functions on @xmath2 called _ configurational elementary degrees of freedom_. analogously , one chooses a set of _ momentum elementary degrees of freedom _ consisting of some real functions on @xmath1 .",
    "next , one defines a special directed set @xmath4each element of this set corresponds to a finite collection of both configurational and momentum elementary d.o.f.and with every element @xmath5 of @xmath6 one associates a set of quantum states denoted by @xmath7 .    given @xmath8 , the set @xmath7 of quantum stated is constructed as follows .",
    "the element @xmath5 corresponds to a finite set @xmath9 of configurational d.o.f .. one uses the d.o.f . in @xmath9 to reduce `` infinite - dimensional '' space @xmath2 to a finite dimensional space @xmath10this reduction consists in identifying all points of @xmath2 for which each d.o.f . in @xmath9",
    "gives the same value .",
    "then one defines a hilbert space of functions on @xmath10 square integrable with respect to a measure on @xmath10 .",
    "the set @xmath7 is a set of all density operators ( i.e. positive operators of trace equal @xmath11 ) on this hilbert space  because density operators represent some ( mixed , in general , ) quantum states one can treat @xmath7 as a set of such states .    in this way",
    "one obtains a family @xmath12 of sets of quantum states .",
    "if the set @xmath4 is chosen properly then it naturally generates on @xmath12 the structure of a projective family .",
    "finally , the desired space of kinematic quantum states related to the original phase space @xmath0 is defined as the projective limit of the family .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the task of constructing such a space of quantum states reduces to a construction of a directed set @xmath4 satisfying some assumptions ",
    "these assumptions are imposed both on elementary d.o.f .",
    "constituting elements of @xmath6 and the relation @xmath13 . since now",
    "a directed set @xmath4 satisfying all these assumption will be called _ proper directed set @xmath4 . _",
    "the goal of the present paper is to find variables on the ( hamiltonian ) configuration space @xmath2 of tegr which are suitable for constructing a proper directed set @xmath4 for the theory .",
    "more precisely , we are looking for variables on the configuration space which provide a set @xmath3 of configurational d.o.f .",
    "such that    1 .   d.o.f . in @xmath3",
    "separate points of @xmath2 ; [ as - sep ] 2 .   d.o.f . in @xmath3",
    "are defined via integrals of functions of components of the variables ; the functions are polynomials of the components of degree @xmath11 ; [ as - poly ] 3 .",
    "there exists a directed set elements of which are finite subsets of @xmath3 such that for every element @xmath9 of the directed set there exists a natural bijection from @xmath10 onto @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the number of d.o.f . in @xmath9 ; [ as - bij ] 4 .",
    "d.o.f . in @xmath3",
    "are defined in a background independent way i.e. without application of any background field .",
    "[ as - bgi ]    the first three * assumptions * above correspond to some assumptions imposed in @xcite on a proper set @xmath4 . the present assumption [ as - sep ]",
    "can be found in section 2 of @xcite containing preliminaries and the assumption [ as - poly ] above describes a practical way to satisfy assumption 3b of @xcite ( see section 3.2 and section 6.2 in that paper ) .",
    "the present assumption [ as - bij ] corresponds to assumption 2 of @xcite ( see section 3.2 in that paper ) .",
    "let us note that the original assumption 2 is imposed on every finite subset @xmath9 of @xmath3 which ( together with a finite set @xmath16 of momentum d.o.f . )",
    "constitute an element of @xmath4 : `` if @xmath17 , then ... '' .",
    "but we do not have any set @xmath4 for tegr yet  we are at a stage of preparations for constructing such a set  and therefore we can not impose the original assumption 2 as it is formulated in @xcite . instead , we require the existence of a directed set consisting of some special finite subsets of @xmath3formulating in this way the present assumption [ as - bij ] we hope that a directed set of this sort may facilitate a construction of a proper directed set @xmath4 for tegr . finally , assumption [ as - bgi ] express our wish to construct quantum states for tegr in a background independent manner .",
    "results of our inquiries can be summarized as follows : we will find two kinds of variables on the configurations space @xmath2 of tegr which not only satisfy the four assumptions above but can be actually used in a background independent manner to construct two distinct spaces of quantum states for tegr .",
    "one of these variables are natural configurational variables on the phase space of tegr , that is , one - forms @xmath18 , @xmath19 , defined on a three - dimensional manifold being a space - like slice of a spacetime .",
    "we will show , however , that the space of quantum states derived from these variables possesses an undesired property .",
    "therefore we will transform the natural variables obtaining a family of new variables such that some elements of the family can be used to build a space of quantum states for tegr free of that property  a construction of this space will be presented in @xcite .",
    "let us emphasize that the analysis of variables suitable for constructing a space of quantum states for tegr will be continued in an accompanying paper @xcite where we will analyze more closely the family of new variables .",
    "some constructions presented in the present paper are similar to ( elements of ) a construction of a space of kinematic quantum states for a simple background independent theory called degenerate plebaski gravity ( dpg)the latter construction is described in @xcite .",
    "it seems to us that it may be quite helpful for the reader to study first the construction in @xcite since it is simpler that ones described here .",
    "let us finally explain why the lqg methods of constructing quantum states do not seem to be applicable to tegr .",
    "the reason is quite simple : the methods require finite dimensional spaces @xmath20 to be _",
    "compact_. ] and it is rather difficult to obtain naturally such spaces in the case of tegr .    the paper is organized as follows : section 2 contains preliminaries , in section 3 we consider the natural variables @xmath18 and explain why the space of quantum state constructed from them does not seem to be very promising for canonical quantization of tegr . in section 4",
    "we present the family of new variables .",
    "section 5 contains a short summary and an outline of the analysis to be presented in the accompanying paper @xcite . in appendix",
    "we prove two very important lemmas which guarantee that both kinds of variables considered in this paper provide d.o.f . satisfying assumption [ as - bij ] above .",

    "consequently , the set @xmath63 with the directed set @xmath68 satisfies assumption [ as - bij ] .",
    "it is clear that the d.o.f . in @xmath63",

    "we conclude that the set @xmath63 of configurational d.o.f .",
    "defined by the natural variables @xmath18 satisfies all assumptions presented in section [ intro ] .",
    "thus the set @xmath63 seems to be suitable for constructing in a background independent way a set of quantum states for tegr .",
    "in fact , the directed set @xmath68 can be extended to a proper directed set @xmath84 for tegr  the construction of the latter set is fully analogous to the construction of a set @xmath4 for dpg @xcite . since the resulting set @xmath84 for tegr is proper it generates _ a space of kinematic quantum states _ for tegr which will be denoted by @xmath85 .",
    "unfortunately , the space @xmath85 of kinematic quantum states for tegr seems to be too large to be used in a canonical quantization of tegr .",
    "the space is `` too large '' in the following sense .",
    "let us denote by @xmath86 the set of all quadruplets @xmath18 of one - forms on @xmath38 which satisfy condition [ lin - cond ] of the phase space description ( see section [ theta - sec ] ) .",

    "is it possible to isolate quantum states in @xmath85 which do not correspond to lorentzian metrics on @xmath38 ?",

    "we are not able to distinguish between elements of @xmath2 and those of @xmath95see the first equation . on the other hand , all d.o.f . in @xmath63",

    "distinguish between elements of @xmath2 and @xmath95 .",
    "consequently , we are not able to isolate quantum states which do not correspond to lorentzian metrics by means of a family @xmath96 of restrictions such that each restriction @xmath97 is imposed on elements of @xmath91 but would have to isolate desired states at the level of the whole @xmath85 . taking into account the complexity of @xmath85",
    ", this task seems to be very difficult .",
    "therefore we prefer to find other variables which could give us a space of quantum states free of the undesired property of @xmath85 .",
    "the undesired property of @xmath85 just described follows from the fact that the variables @xmath18 can be used to parameterize not only the configuration space @xmath2 but also the larger space @xmath86 ( provided condition [ q - cond ] has been omitted ) .",
    "thus to obtain a space of kinematic quantum states for tegr free of the property of @xmath85 we can try to find new variables which parameterize the space @xmath2 and can not be used to describe those elements of @xmath95 which correspond to lorentzian metrics on @xmath38 .",
    "below we present some preliminary considerations results of which will be used in the next subsection to define such new variables .",
    "condition [ lin - cond ] of the phase space description together with continuity of the fields mean that three of four one - forms @xmath18 define a local coframe on @xmath38 and consequently the remaining one - form can be expressed as a linear combination of the three ones .",
