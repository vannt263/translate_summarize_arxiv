    "the rate of the @xmath0s(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3cl reaction at nova temperatures is dominated by resonances corresponding to states in the compound nucleus @xmath3cl .",
    "the  @xmath0s(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3cl reaction rate was previously calculated based on some measured resonance properties and estimates of others based upon the mirror nucleus @xmath3p  @xcite .",
    "uncertainties in the rate were provided in a subsequent reanalysis  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3cl excitation energies near the proton threshold of @xmath8 = 1581.3(6 )  kev  @xcite used by ref .",
    "@xcite were based on earlier measurements that disagreed at the 2 sigma level ( by 10 - 20 kev ) @xcite , and the resonance strengths were only constrained based upon properties of states in the mirror .",
    "a recent study of 5 states below 2.3  mev via the @xmath3s(@xmath4he,@xmath5)@xmath3cl reaction @xcite is in agreement with the excitation energies reported by ref .",
    "however , significant uncertainties remain regarding resonance strengths and size of systematic uncertainties in the resonance energies .",

    "the  spectrograph separates particles according to their magnetic rigidities , @xmath14 , so that discrete positions at the focal plane correspond to discrete momenta . the positions of detected particles at an enge focal plane were determined by a  position - sensitive ionization drift chamber filled with 150 torr of isobutane gas  @xcite . as the ions pass through the gas , the amount of charge collected by the cathode determines the energy lost in the detector .",

    "over much of the range of nova temperatures our recommended rate is significantly greater than even the `` high rate '' recommended in ref .",
    "this arises from the contribution of individual resonances . in fig .",
    "[ f : individualres ] the individual resonance reaction rates from ref .",
    "@xcite are compared to our results .",
    "our higher reaction rate at most nova temperatures arises from the fact that the resonance energies adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite ( and derived from @xcite ) are greater than our energies by 6 - 15 kev ( 9 kev on average ) .",
    "the excitation energies adopted by @xcite and @xcite primarily reflect a weighted average of @xcite and @xcite after the results of @xcite were shifted to match the 1168 kev excitation energy .",
    "the 3 - 5 kev uncertainties in the adopted excitation energies do not properly reflect systematic uncertainties , such as uncertainties in the calibration used or the discrepancies between measurements .    s(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3cl rate . ]",
    "our rate also differs from that of @xcite due to improved values for resonance strengths .",
    "it should be noted that while we adopt a resonance strength for the 153 kev resonance that is nearly the same as @xcite , this arises from two significant changes that largely cancel each other .",
    "our lower resonance energy results in a significantly smaller penetrability , but we recommend a significantly greater spectroscopic factor based on our reanalysis of the transfer data of  @xcite . our reaction rate near peak nova temperatures , @xmath35  gk , becomes smaller than that of @xcite due to our improved values for the proton branching ratios of the 546 and 622 kev resonances .",
    "we find @xmath36 for the 546 kev resonance to be about 30% smaller than estimated by @xcite and @xmath36 for the 622 kev resonance to be about 2 orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "the smaller proton widths result in smaller resonance strengths and reaction rates , though the magnitude of the effect is mitigated by the lower value of the resonance energies for these states that makes for a smaller decrease in the reaction rate than would otherwise be .    at higher temperatures ( above about 2 gk ) our rate increases in comparison to  @xcite due to our inclusion of resonances above 2  mev",
    "that were not previously considered .",
    "in summary , we have significantly improved the resonance energies and resonance strengths for some of the most important resonances in the @xmath0s(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3cl reaction .",
    "an important aspect of the current work is that we have given careful consideration to uncertainties , including systematic uncertainties in the level energies , states used for calibration , and target thickness effects .",
    "the largest uncertainties in the reaction rate at nova temperatures arise from the systematic uncertainty in the resonance energies and the resonance strength of the 153 kev resonance .",
    "our excitation energy for the 1734.2(14 ) kev state ( corresponding to the 153 kev resonance ) differs from the value of 1736.7(6 ) reported by @xcite ( which used a slightly different set of calibration reactions ) by 2.5 kev or slightly more than @xmath37 .",
    "however , we estimate the systematic uncertainty in the resonance energies to be 4 kev , which is in agreement with the fact that the excitation energies for all levels reported by @xcite are higher on average than this work by about 4 kev",
    ". additional experimental information leading to an improvement in the resonance energies would therefore be valuable .",
    "as the states most important for novae have substantial branches for gamma decay , an accurate measurement of gamma - ray energies using a complementary approach , for example as in @xcite , would be particularly helpful in reducing the systematic uncertainties that arise largely from q - value uncertainties in reaction studies like this one .",
    "a direct measurement of the resonance strength of the 153 kev resonance ( or corresponding proton width ) is also desired , but would be experimentally challenging .",
    "the authors would like to thank the staff of the wnsl for their help and support during the measurement .",
    "the authors also thank b.  alex brown for his help with the state configurations in @xmath3p needed for the dwba calculation , the estimate of the effect of the  coulomb and other isospin - nonconserving  interactions on the spectroscopic factor , as well as the shell - model spectroscopic factor calculation for the 3695  kev state , and christian iliadis for helpful discussions and for providing unpublished information regarding details of the analysis in @xcite .",
