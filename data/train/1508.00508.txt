    "the physics related to bilayer structures is now the subject of intensive theoretical and experimental researches due to the recent developments in the field of electronic nanotechnologies and researches on the high speed information processing technologies .",
    "the most prominent example in the technological applications of such systems is related to the recently investigated graphene - based bilayers , which are very promising in the context of future nanoelectronic devices.@xcite another interest related to the double layer structured materials is that they are good candidates for the exciton condensate formation at the very low temperatures.@xcite the possibility of formation of the excitonic condensates in semiconducting materials has been suggested long years before @xcite and , it was an intensively studied problem in the intervening years.@xcite    to control the formation of the excitonic condensate in the double layer structured systems , an external electric or magnetic field are supposed to be applied to the bilayer structure .",
    "the possibility of the excitonic condensate formation in two - dimensions ( 2d ) , under strong magnetic field in a semiconductor heterostructure , with a very field - sensitive band structure , is given in refs . and .",
    "a thermodynamically stable condensate formation in inas - gasb -based system is discussed in ref .",
    ", where a study of the keldysh - bcs theory is given",
    ". meanwhile , a new platform - material is proposed for studying the excitonic condensates .",
    "recently , the detailed phase diagram for the inverted inas / gasb bilayer quantum wells is given also,@xcite and the possibility of the stable @xmath0-wave exciton condensed phase is proved .",
    "contrary , for the large interlayer tunneling amplitude , a topologically non - trivial quantum spin hall insulator phase is obtained with the @xmath1-wave pairing gap .    despite of many theoretical investigations in this field of research",
    "the exact results , for the ground state properties of the electron - hole systems are rare .",
    "a determinant quantum monte carlo study of the exciton condensation in the bilayer hubbard model is given recently .",
    "@xcite both , on - site coulomb interaction and interlayer electrostatic interactions are considered.however , the question whether the true excitonic condensate formation is possible at the very low temperatures is still open .",
    "another interesting problem in the field of the correlated bilayer systems @xcite is related to the phase coherence in the excitonic condensate regime .",
    "mainly , it has been shown recently that the excitonic pair formation and the excitonic condensation , are two different phases of matter .",
    "@xcite thus , the question of the coherent excitonic condensate formation in double layer structures needs to be revised substantially .    in this paper",
    "we examine the possibility of the exciton formation in the asymmetric double bilayer electron - hole structure with zero applied external electric field .",
    "we suppose the case of the negative hopping amplitude for the layer-1 electrons ( see in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_1 ] ) , rending the problem to that of the electron - hole type bilayer structure .",
    "we will show how the excitonic gap is formed and how the strength of it determines the type of the excitons , which are divided into two categories : frenkel and wannier - mott - type excitons .",
    "frenkel - type excitons are mediated by the localized coulomb interaction and are the strongly bound excitations , and the wannier - mott excitons are delocalized , controlled by a weak coulomb attraction between the electron - hole particles . for a asymmetric type bilayer structure",
    "we demonstrate that the solutions of the chemical potential appear in the form of two well defined bands , separated by a gap region and we show that the values of energies , at which the frenkel - type formations could appear in the system , are located between different bounds of the chemical potential forming the frenkel channel in the exciton formation energy scheme . in the region of the very low pairing gap values",
    ", we show the presence of the wannier - mott - type excitonic gap lobes , which decrease when increasing the intralayer coulomb interaction .",
    "we show , that at zero temperature the excitonic gap parameter is degenerated , which is a direct consequence of the presence of the frenkel - type energy zone in the chemical potential solution and which disappears at higher temperatures , when the single valued frenkel channels are opening .",
    "we will calculate the temperature dependence of the excitonic gap parameter by considering different values of the intralayer coulomb interaction parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the section [ sec : section_2 ] we introduce the bilayer hamiltonian to describe the possible interactions in the system .",
    "we discuss also the linearization of the non - linear interaction terms in the hamiltonian and the general solution strategy of the problem . in the section [ sec : section_3 ]",
    "we introduce the effective fermionic action and we introduce the self - consistent ( sc ) equations for the excitonic gap parameter and chemical potential . in section [ sec : section_4 ] , we give the numerical solution of the problem of the interacting bilayer system , and we present the results for the excitonic gap parameter and the chemical potential .",
