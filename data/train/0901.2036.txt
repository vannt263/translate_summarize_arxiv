    "understanding of nuclear matter at extreme conditions is one of key issues to clarify the problems in core - collapse supernovae as well as neutron stars and heavy ion collisions . while heavy ion reactions are often employed to explore the nuclear matter equation of state ( eos ) , careful theoretical work is needed to analyze the experimental signatures and to reconstruct the properties of hot and dense matter from the detected abundances and energy distributions of ejectiles or from correlation functions between different ejectiles , produced in those reactions .    among the interesting observables are the yield ratios of different fragments measured in such reactions . in many experiments",
    "one commonly observes light elements such as neutrons ( @xmath2 ) , protons ( @xmath3 ) , deuterons ( @xmath4 ) , tritons ( @xmath5 ) , @xmath6he ( @xmath7 ) , and @xmath8he ( @xmath9 ) ( see for example ref .",

    "therein ) .",
    "larger clusters , typically with mass numbers @xmath10 , are also observed and the production process of these fragments must be explained .    the decay of highly excited nuclear matter produced in heavy ion collisions is a complex dynamic process which needs , in principle , a sophisticated treatment .",
    "one simple approach is the freeze - out concept in which the hot and dense matter in the initial stage is assumed to reach thermal equilibrium as long as reaction rates are high . with decreasing density , the reaction rates decrease and the equilibration process becomes suppressed .",
    "at that time the nuclear thermal and chemical equilibrium is frozen out . often the description of the nuclear matter , in particular the distribution of clusters , is calculated within a statistical multifragmentation model assuming nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) @xcite . under the simplifying assumption that the final reaction product distribution is identical to the cluster distribution at the freeze out point ,",
    "the thermodynamic parameters such as temperature @xmath11 and particle number densities , @xmath12 and @xmath13 for neutrons and protons , respectively , can be reconstructed from the observed abundances . a simple method for extracting the temperature of the fragmenting hot system",
    "was given by albergo , costa , costanzo and rubbino ( accr ) @xcite .",
    "the method is based on selecting double isotope ( or isotone ) ratios , @xmath14 , such that the nucleon chemical potentials are eliminated leading to a relation between @xmath14 , @xmath11 and the binding energies of the isotopes ( isotones ) .",
    "this method has been used in the analysis of a large number of experiments .",
    "see , for example , the early works of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , one has to be aware that the dynamic reaction processes do not cease abruptly , so that the concept of a unique freeze out time is only approximate . a single freeze out time , independent of the species under consideration and their dynamical state , the flow and further parameters describing non - equilibrium effects , may not exist . in addition ,",
    "secondary ( post freeze - out ) decay will modify the original distribution which also contains excited states , and the decay products will be found in the final distribution .",
    "we point out that in ref .",
    "@xcite , the accr method was modified to account for the screening due to the coulomb interactions among fragments in the freeze - out volume by using the wigner - seitz approximation @xcite .",
    "it was found that the corrections for the temperature are less than 20% , though for certain isotone double ratios it can be as large as 50% . in ref .",
    "@xcite the accr method was modified to account for the effect of radial collective flow .",
    "it was found that the effect on the extracted temperature is relatively small , but the increase in the freeze - out density can be significant for large flow energy .",
    "it was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite that an important improvement of the simple accr method resulted from taking into account post emission decay ( secondary decay ) processes of particles and , in particular , @xmath15 which modify the freeze - out yield ratios . without this correction",
    ", different double ratios @xmath14 associated with selected sets of fragments ( different thermometers ) may result in significantly different temperature @xmath11 .",

    "if the freeze - out density is not very low , i.e. not at baryon number densities @xmath16 fm@xmath0 , the nse will be modified by medium effects . in this paper , the shift of the binding energies of the light elements in hot and dense nuclear matter @xcite is considered .",
    "the changes of the mass fractions of different nuclei due to medium effects complicates the determination of the temperature @xmath11 and baryon number density @xmath17 from yields of the observed products . in the following",

    "other combinations of isotopes can be used to construct double ratios of cluster yields where , within a simple nse , the chemical potentials cancel out so that an accr temperature can be derived directly .",
    "thus , thermometers based on the yields of other nuclei such as lithium or beryllium isotopes can be introduced .",
    "similar approaches are used in hadron production to derive the temperature for the quark - gluon plasma phase transition @xcite , or in plasma physics @xcite considering spectral line intensities of different ionization states of radiating atoms .",
    "the advantage of the double ratio is that , within nse , it does not contain the density , because the chemical potentials cancel .",
    "therefore the temperature determination seems to be insensitive with respect to the determination of other parameters .",
    "these other parameters , in particular the chemical potentials , are observed if , in addition to the double ratios like @xmath52 , the single ratios @xmath56 of yields are considered .",
    "there are some objections to inferring the parameter values of hot dense matter from the cluster yields .",
    "first , we have to take into account that collisions lead to initially inhomogeneous system evolving in time . even assuming local thermal equilibrium",
    ", one has to separate the ejectiles arising from different sources . in efforts to do this ,",
    "the h - he thermometer has been applied to the double ratio @xmath57 of cluster yields @xmath38 for clusters with the same surface velocity @xcite . in that case",
    "an additional factor @xmath58 arises in the temperature equation when the number densities as a function of velocity are employed .",
    "an important improvement of the simple nse model was to take into account secondary decay processes which modify the freeze - out yield ratios .",
    "this has been considered in different papers .",
    "this correction is essential to reduce the differences of the accr temperatures obtained from different thermometers @xcite .",
    "the simple nse is based on a chemical picture considering a non - interacting , ideal mixture of different components , which is in chemical equilibrium due to reactive collisions as described by the mass action law .",
    "such an approach is valid in the low - density limit , and related expressions such as virial expansions can be taken as a benchmark in that limit @xcite . with increasing density ,",
    "modifications arise which are based on taking the interactions between the different components into account .",
    "thus , as the density increases , corrections to the accr approach to derive the temperatures of hot and dense matter are expected . in earlier work , the effects of the screening of the coulomb interaction and of the flow on the freeze - out density and temperature of disassembling hot nuclei",
    "have been considered @xcite .",
    "the effect of screening of the coulomb interaction becomes of importance for heavy nuclei at densities near to the saturation density .",
    "the main topic we address in this paper is the required modification of the description of the matter as an ideal , noninteracting mixture of different components when densities are not low enough to justify this assumption . despite the fact that the nucleon - nucleon interaction is short - ranged",
    ", the interaction between the free nucleons as well as nucleons bound in clusters is negligible only below about @xmath59 times the nuclear saturation density , i.e. at baryonic densities @xmath16 fm@xmath0 .",
    "an important question is the role of medium effects due to the nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "in fact , our work indicates that the concept of the simple nse considering hot and dense nuclear matter as an ideal mixture of different clusters is not appropriate to describe disassembling hot matter at densities at and above approximately one tenth of saturation density .",
    "we address this in the following section .",
    "recent progress in the description of clusters in low density nuclear matter @xcite enables us to evaluate the abundance of deuterons , tritons and helium nuclei in a microscopic approach , taking the influence of the medium into account . within a quantum statistical approach to the many - particle system , we determine the single - particle spectral function , which allows calculation of the density of the nucleons as a function of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
