    "isolated pulsars are spinning neutron stars whose observed spin rates gradually decrease with time .",
    "the age @xmath2 of a pulsar is usually assumed to be equal to the timing ( or characteristic ) age @xmath3 derived by assuming pure magnetic dipole spin - down _ in vacuo _ , and the age is then given by @xmath4 ( e.g. @xcite ) , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the angular spin frequency and angular frequency derivative for a pulsar spin period @xmath7 and period derivative @xmath8 .",
    "under this same assumption of mdr spin - down , the magnetic field strength of the pulsar is given by the formula ( @xcite ) @xmath9 which is often assumed to be equal to the true field strength of the isolated pulsar ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "psr b175724 is a @xmath10 s radio pulsar which appears to be associated with the supernova remnant g5.41.2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the pulsar is surrounded by a compact radio nebula having a cometary morphology with a tail extending back into the supernova remnant ( @xcite )  strongly suggesting that the pulsar was formed in the supernova which produced g5.41.2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "given the temporal parameters of psr b175724 ( @xmath11 s and @xmath12 s s@xmath13 ; @xcite ) , @xmath14 kyr and @xmath15 g for the pulsar .",
    "assuming that @xmath3 is similar to the pulsar s its true age , the transverse velocity implied by the pulsar s displacement from the apparent center of the g5.41.2 is greater than @xmath16 km s@xmath13 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "observations of psr b175724 taken six years apart , however , failed to detect the expected proper motion from the pulsar , yielding a distance - independent lower limit on the age of psr b175724/g5.41.2 of @xmath17 kyr ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is more than a factor of two greater than the pulsar s mdr characteristic age .",
    "the discrepancy between the proper motion age and the mdr characteristic age of psr b175724 suggests that the spin - down of the pulsar is not due purely to mdr but also has significant contributions from other sources of torque .",
    "istomin ( 1994 ) considered a model for psr b175724 in which the pulsar was interacting with dense plasma in the shell of g5.41.2 , causing an increase in the torque at the light cylinder . here",
    "we consider another possible source of extra torque on the neutron star  from a disk of material accreted from ejecta produced in the supernova explosion .",
    "these _ fallback disks _ may be roughly divided into two categories : `` prompt '' and `` delayed '' .",
    "prompt disks may be formed from @xmath18 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) of ejecta material soon after the initial core collapse in a type ii supernova explosion ( @xcite ) .",
    "formation of such prompt disks is probably limited to @xmath19 days after the core collapse because of heating of the ejecta by @xmath20ni decays ( @xcite ) .",
    "delayed disks may form years after the explosion from ejecta decelerated by radiative cooling ( @xcite ) or by a strong reverse shock ( @xcite ) caused by the primary supernova blast wave impinging on dense circumstellar material from the pre - supernova stellar wind ( @xcite ) . whether or not a neutron star accretion disk can form shortly after a supernova explosion depends on the opposing forces of the pulsar mdr wind and the pressure of the hot and turbulent environment shortly after the explosion .",
    "since the latter is highly uncertain ( @xcite ) , for the purposes of this _ letter _ we assume that a disk can form around a neutron star under these conditions and explore the implications for psr b175724 .",
    "an accretion disk around a magnetized neutron star can exert a spin - down torque on the star if the mass inflow rate is low and the magnetic field is strong .",
    "quantitatively , this condition is met when the keplerian co - rotation radius @xmath21 cm is less than the magnetospheric radius @xmath22 cm , where @xmath23 g s@xmath13 is the mass inflow rate onto the magnetosphere and @xmath24 g is the strength of the neutron star dipole magnetic field ( see e.g @xcite ) . here and elsewhere",
    "we assume a neutron star mass and radius of @xmath25 and @xmath26 km , respectively . when @xmath27 , infalling material is stopped at the magnetosphere by a centrifugal barrier which prevents accretion onto the neutron star surface .",
    "instead , the infalling material may be accelerated away in a wind which carries away angular momentum from the magnetosphere and hence the neutron star itself .",
    "this `` propeller effect '' ( @xcite ) spin - down mechanism has been invoked to explain the behavior of some galactic accretion  powered x ",
    "ray pulsars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the spin - evolution of anomalous x  ray pulsars ( axps : @xcite ; @xcite ) and soft gamma ",
    "ray repeaters ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the optical and infrared spectra of some radio pulsars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the pulsar b175724 is in the propeller regime ( @xmath28 ) for mass inflow rates of @xmath29 g s@xmath13 and a canonical ( @xcite ; @xcite ) neutron star magnetic field of @xmath30 g. since the characteristic age for an old ( @xmath31 kyr ) pulsar depends only weakly on the initial spin period ( @xcite ) , we neglect the different formation times of the delayed and prompt fallback disks , and assume that the spin - down evolution of the pulsar at all times is determined by the combined torque from both the mdr and the accretion disk",
    ". the spin - down rate due to radiation from a rotating magnetic dipole is ( @xcite ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the neutron star moment of inertia .",
    "the spin - down rate due to the propeller torque vanishes gradually ( @xcite ; @xcite ) as the star approaches spin - equilibrium ( @xmath34 ) at a spin period @xmath35 s. the spin - down rate due to the propeller torque is simply ( @xcite ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a positive constant of order unity ( @xcite ) and @xmath38 . assuming a constant mass inflow rate and dipole magnetic field , the timing age for a final spin period @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the initial angular frequency . a more realistic expression for",
    "the propeller torque would incorporate a time dependent mass inflow rate ( @xcite ) in equation ( [ wind ] ) , as @xmath42 should decrease in time as the disk dissipates .",
    "for the model to be correct , however , a disk must still be present around the pulsar , because otherwise the mdr timing age would be greater than the true age .",
    "therefore the @xmath42 used here may be thought of as a time - averaged value of the mass inflow rate .",
    "in addition , the effect of the propeller flow on the mdr torque ( @xcite ) is not taken into account .",
    "we plan on incorporating both of these effects in future work .",
    "a contour plot of the pulsar b175724 timing age @xmath43 for various values of the magnetic field strength @xmath44 and mass inflow rate @xmath42 is show in figure 1 .",
    "the characteristic ages were calculated using equations ( [ mdr][age ] ) and assuming @xmath11 s , @xmath45 ms , and @xmath46 . in this simple model ,",
    "the allowed values of @xmath44 and @xmath42 for pulsar b175724 lie on the heavy solid line corresponding to the observed @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , the shaded regions of parameter space in figure 1 are excluded by the lower limit on the age ( right shaded region : @xcite ) , and the necessary condition @xmath27 ( shaded region in upper left corner ) . from figure 1 , we find that values of @xmath47 g , @xmath48 g s@xmath13 , and @xmath49 kyr are consistent with the lower limit on the true age of @xmath17 kyr ( @xcite ) and the present - day spin - down rate of the pulsar .",
    "in the context of this model , the required mass inflow rate for psr b175724 overlaps the range of @xmath42 inferred from accretion  powered neutron star systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "radio pulsations are not seen from accretion  powered x ",
    "ray pulsars in binary systems ( @xcite ) , which implies that the emission mechanism responsible for radio pulsations may be quenched by matter near the polar caps of the pulsar .",
    "this is not a problem for the psr b175724 model , however , because in propeller sources most of the matter is ejected before it has a chance to reach the polar cap and quench the radio emission .",
    "radio emission may be suppressed for propeller sources closer to spin equilibrium than psr b175724 ( e.g. the axps : @xcite ) , however , because as equilibrium is approached more matter will be allowed to fall onto the neutron star surface .",
    "the total mass required to fuel the propeller spin - down over the lifetime ( so far ) of pulsar b175724 would be @xmath50  a tiny fraction of the total amount of ejecta in a typical type ii supernova explosion ( @xcite ) .",
    "this hypothesis can be tested by multiwavelength observations . in this model ,",
    "the total emission from the pulsar would be due to the propeller wind , mdr , and thermal emission from the accretion disk .",
    "wang & robertson ( 1985 ) calculated the angle  integrated thermal bremsstrahlung emissivity @xmath51 from the heated plasma in a propeller flow .",
    "using their scalings , the x  ray luminosity and temperature are given by @xmath52 erg s@xmath13 and @xmath53 kev , respectively , where @xmath54 is the width of the magnetospheric boundary layer where the plasma is heated by the magnetic field .",
    "this assumes spherical symmetry , so the luminosity will probably be @xmath55 ergs s@xmath13 or less for the case of a disk geometry .",
    "if psr 175724 is not a propeller source , we would expect the non - thermal x  ray emission which is characteristic of young rotation",
    " powered pulsars ( @xcite ) ",
    "e.g. a power law emission spectrum with a photon index @xmath56 and an x  ray luminosity given by the empirical relation @xmath57 erg s@xmath13 . at a distance of @xmath58 kpc ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the flux from the non - thermal , non - propeller emission would be @xmath59 ergs @xmath60 s@xmath13 , which would be easily detectable by _ xmm _ or _",
    "chandra_. the detection of dimmer , thermal x  ray emission instead of the brighter non - thermal emission would be evidence in support of the propeller model",
    ".    cooler disk blackbody emission could also be visible at optical and infrared wavelengths from the accretion disk .",
    "the spectrum of propeller disks depend on @xmath44 , @xmath42 , and the disk orientation with respect to the line of sight ( e.g. @xcite ) , but we can place an upper limit on the optical emission from a psr b175724 disk in the following manner . assuming that the majority of the optical disk emission originates at the innermost disk radii ( @xcite ) , the upper limit on the optical luminosity is @xmath61 @xmath62 .",
    "this estimate ignores heating of the disk by irradiation from the pulsar , which dominates the heating only for pulsar luminosities @xmath63 ergs s@xmath13 ( @xcite ) .",
    "assuming @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and an apparent visual magnitude of @xmath66 for the sun ( @xcite ) , the apparent magnitude of the disk at @xmath58 kpc ( uncorrected for extinction ) is @xmath67 .",
    "the extinction @xmath68 can be estimated from the formula @xmath69 mag @xmath60 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath70 is the @xmath71 column density along the line of sight . at a distance of @xmath58 kpc , @xmath72 @xmath60 in the galactic plane ( as can be seen from the axp spectral data in @xcite ) , which yields an extinction of @xmath73 mag and a lower limit on the disk magnitude of @xmath74 .",
    "this is comparable to the estimated magnitudes of propeller disks around axps as calculated by perna et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "if psr b175724 is indeed surrounded by an accretion disk , then fossil accretion disks and propeller spin - down may be present , or may have been present at one time , in a significant fraction of isolated pulsars .",
    "this would affect the distributions of pulsar ages , magnetic field strengths , and space velocities inferred using the pulsar s @xmath7 and @xmath8 values and the mdr formulae discussed in @xmath75 .",
    "magnetic field strengths estimated using equation ( [ eq0 ] ) , for example , would overestimate the true field strengths for both pulsars currently undergoing propeller spin - down _ and _ for pulsars which had experienced some propeller spin - down in the past ( and whose disks had subsequently dissipated ) .",
    "the effect on the distribution of radio pulsar ages  and hence the distribution of pulsar velocities inferred from their angular positions ( e.g. @xcite )  depends on whether each pulsar is currently undergoing propeller spin - down or not .",
    "if a pulsar is currently undergoing propeller spin - down , then the mdr timing age @xmath3 is an _ underestimate _ of the true age ( as exemplified by psr b175724 ) .",
    "if a pulsar had a propeller disk which then dissipated , its present  day mdr age would be an _ overestimate _ of its true age , since the pulsar had undergone a period of increased spin - down rate ( over the mdr spin - down rate ) in the past .",
    "the latter scenario is probably more prevalent in the observed population of radio pulsars , since radio pulsations may be scattered and quenched in neutron stars with strong propeller flows ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , and therefore one might expect a systematic overestimation of radio pulsar ages due to fossil disks and propeller spin - down .",
    "curiously , such a systematic overestimation of pulsar ages using mdr has been inferred from some pulsar population studies ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have shown that the addition of torques from an accretion disk can explain the discrepancy between the mdr timing age of psr b175724 and its true age .",
    "this model can be tested through x  ray and optical observations of this pulsar . the accretion disk model for pulsar b175724 leaves",
    "open the question of whether or not pulsar b175724 is an unusual and rare object or if it instead reflects a generic feature in the evolution of neutron stars .",
    "if the former is true , the accretion model removes the need ( @xcite ) to revise our current understanding of the physics and astrophysics of neutron stars because of this single pulsar . if the latter is true , however , the distributions of pulsar magnetic field strengths , ages , and velocities will have to be reconsidered to take into account the effects of increased spin - down due to accretion disk torques .",
    "observations of young pulsars associated with supernova remnants may hold the key towards resolving this question , because the pulsar ages can be constrained independently of the pulsar temporal parameters .",
