    "the discovery of a new boson in july 2012 by the atlas  @xcite and cms collaborations  @xcite at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is a landmark in the history of particle physics .",
    "this scalar is most likely _ the _ higgs boson which is the last missing block in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "although it answers most of the questions concerning fundamental particles , the sm has a few shortcomings , thus encouraging a search for theories beyond the standard model . among the inadequacies",
    "are the lack of clear answers on the questions of the origins of neutrino mass and dark matter .",
    "it also can not provide the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe .",
    "one of the simplest ways to go beyond the sm is by extending the scalar sector .",
    "this of course affects the @xmath2 parameter , whose deviation from the tree level value of unity is a measure of new physics .",
    "the general expression for the tree level @xmath2 parameter for an su(2)@xmath4u(1 ) gauge theory with @xmath5 scalar multiplets is  @xcite @xmath6v_i^2 } { \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{{i}=1}^{n}y_{{i}}^{2}v_i^2}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the weak isospin and hypercharge of the @xmath9 scalar multiplet respectively , and @xmath10 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the neutral component of that multiplet .",
    "if the scalar sector contains only su(2 ) singlets with @xmath11 and doublets with @xmath12 , then @xmath13 is automatically satisfied without requiring any fine tuning among the vevs .",
    "this conforms with the experimental value of @xmath2 , which is very close to unity  @xcite .",
    "we therefore confine our discussions to the doublet extensions , specifically the two higgs - doublet models ( 2hdms )  @xcite , which have received a lot of attention mainly because the type ii 2hdm arises as part of minimal supersymmetry .    in this paper",
    "we consider the restrictions imposed on the scalar masses by a criterion of naturalness , embodied in the veltman conditions , in various limits of 2hdms of all types .",
    "the alignment limit and the reverse alignment limit are two scenarios in which the lighter and the heavier cp - even neutral scalar , respectively , correspond to the observed higgs particle .",
    "we also consider the cases where these occur in conjunction with the wrong sign limit , in which the yukawa coupling of at least one type of fermion is of the opposite sign as the vector coupling .",
    "using the naturalness conditions we analyze the parameter space of masses of scalars in 2hdms of different types .",
    "the parameter space is further restricted by constraints arising from the @xmath2-parameter , global stability of the scalar potential , and requirement of perturbative unitarity .",
    "section ii gives a brief review of 2hdm .",
    "sections iii and iv deal with various limits of two higgs doublet models and their permutations . in section",
    "v we calculate the higgs - diphoton decay width for one of the scenarios and section vi concludes with a discussion of the results .",
    "we will work with the scalar potential  @xcite considered under the imposition of a u(1 ) symmetry which forbids flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) , @xmath14 with real @xmath15 .",
    "this potential is invariant under the symmetry @xmath16 except for a soft breaking term @xmath17 additional dimension-4 terms , including one allowed by a softly broken @xmath18 symmetry  @xcite are also set to zero by this u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "this is the same u(1 ) symmetry which prevents fcnc by having left- and right - handed fermions transform differently under it , leading to the four types of 2hdms .",
    "the scalar doublets are parametrized as @xmath19 where the vevs @xmath20 may be taken to be real and positive without any loss of generality .",
    "three of these fields get `` eaten '' by the @xmath21 and @xmath22 gauge bosons ; the remaining five are physical scalar fields .",
    "there is a pair of charged scalars denoted by @xmath23 , two neutral cp - even scalars @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and one cp - odd pseudoscalar denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "the two cp - even scalars have distinct masses , and @xmath27 with @xmath28 the scalar fields are given by the combinations @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 etc .",

    "this can be ensured by using the global u(1 ) symmetry mentioned earlier , which generalizes a @xmath18 symmetry more commonly employed for this purpose .",
    "the left handed fermion doublets remain unchanged under this symmetry , @xmath43 the transformations of right handed fermion singlets determine the type of 2hdm .",

    "we have chosen the ranges 225 gev@xmath189290 gev and 200 gev@xmath190 300 gev which cover the allowed ranges for all four types for @xmath191 although a picture is worth a thousand words , it is perhaps worth pointing out that when @xmath93 is small , for example @xmath192 gev , the diphoton decay width deviates from the sm value by 5 - 7% for all values of @xmath193 the deviation is noticeable for many other values of @xmath93 also , as can be easily seen from the plots . on the other hand , for specific choices of @xmath194",
    "the @xmath156 decay width is the same as for the sm , so the non - observation of a deviation does not rule out 2hdms .",
    "the two plots are similar , but not identical .",
    "the decay width when the @xmath134 yukawa coupling is of the ` wrong sign ' is smaller than the decay width for the case when it is of the same sign ( as @xmath131 couplings ) by about 1.5% , as can be seen from the ratio of the decay widths , displayed in fig .",
    "[ relative.fig ] .",
    "in this paper we have looked at how a certain criterion of naturalness , namely the cancellation of quadratic divergences , affect the allowed ranges of masses of the additional scalars in 2hdms in the alignment or sm - like limit with ` wrong sign ' yukawa couplings , and also in the reverse alignment limit .",
    "a similar calculation was done in  @xcite for the alignment limit without the ` wrong sign ' assumption .",
    "we found that reverse alignment , _",
    "i.e. _ the scenario in which the heavier cp - even neutral scalar is the standard model higgs particle , is clearly not a viable scenario for 2hdms .",
    "constraints arising from naturalness , stability , perturbative unitarity and experimental bounds on the @xmath2-parameter completely rule out this scenario .",
    "the naturalness criterion is crucial for this conclusion  reverse alignment is an allowed scenario if quadratic divergences are taken care of by some mechanism of fine tuning , for example .",
    "we have also considered a limit where the lighter cp - even neutral scalar corresponds to the sm - like higgs but where the yukawa couplings of this particle to @xmath195-type quarks are of the wrong sign relative to their gauge couplings . in this scenario",
    "we obtain mass ranges for the rest of the physical higgs bosons for various benchmark values of @xmath75 . in this paper",
    "we have shown only the plot for type ii 2hdm , but the results are similar for the other 2hdms with a small variation of a few gev .",
    "the higgs - diphoton decay width in a 2hdm receives additional contributions from loops containing the charged scalar @xmath23 , so the decay width in a 2hdm is different from the sm value .",
    "further , in the wrong sign limit , loops containing down type quarks contribute with a different sign .",
    "we have plotted the @xmath196 decay width against the mass of the charged higgs , and also for different values of the mass of the cp - odd neutral scalar , and found that the decay width can differ from its sm value by up tp 6% for some values of the parameters .",
    "while this paper was being completed , another paper which investigates what we call the reverse alignment limit appeared as an e - print  @xcite .",
    "however , that paper uses fewer constraints , so limits on the masses of @xmath197 are less restrictive .",
    "more recently , the atlas and cms collaborations at the lhc have reported an excess corresponding to a diphoton resonance at 750 gev  @xcite .",
    "we note that according to the naturalness criterion we have used in this paper , this excess can not be one of the scalar particles in any of the four types of 2hdms , in agreement with the negative result found in  @xcite using several other lines of argument .",
    "ab thanks dipankar das for useful discussions .",
    "the authors thank the anonymous referee for raising questions about the plot of the diphoton decay width in the first version , which helped us find and correct a mistake in the original plot .",
