    "in unconventional superconductors , the bcs order parameter possesses internal degrees of freedom , which give rise to various rich physics , as explored for helium 3 @xcite , sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 @xcite , and heavy fermion superconductors @xcite . for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , a possible realization of a chiral @xmath2 pairing state",
    "is suggested by several experimental and theoretical studies @xcite . in this",
    "@xmath3-wave pairing state , time - reversal symmetry is broken by orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "because of this feature , the chiral @xmath2 superconductor bears some similarities to the quantum - hall - effect ( qhe ) state @xcite . for instance , in a chiral @xmath2 superconductor with open boundaries , a gapless edge mode propagating in only one direction appear at the boundary edges , which is in analogy with a chiral edge state in the qhe state .",
    "this similarity ultimately stems from the realization of a topological state in both of these quantum condensed phases .",
    "a topological state is a novel class of quantum ground state which is characterized not by conventional long - range order , but by a topologically nontrivial structure of the hilbert space . in a topological state",
    ", there is a bulk excitation energy gap which ensures the stability of this state , and , as mentioned above , there are also gapless edge states which play an important role for transport phenomena . in the case with",
    "broken time - reversal symmetry such as the qhe state and the chiral @xmath2 superconductors , the topological structure is associated with the existence of a nonzero topological number , i.e. the chern number @xcite . recently ,",
    "another class of a topological state was theoretically proposed for band insulators @xcite and experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "this topological state , which is called the @xmath4 topological insulator , possesses time - reversal symmetry , in contrast to the above - mentioned topological state without time - reversal symmetry , and is characterized by the existence of two counter - propagating gapless edge modes , which are associated with the kramers doublet .",
    "these gapless edge modes give rise to the quantum spin hall effect , which has been attracting recently much interest in connection with possible applications to spintronics .",
    "as there is similarity between the chiral @xmath2 superconductors and the qhe state , there is parallelism between the @xmath4 topological insulator and noncentrosymmetric @xmath3-wave superconductors @xcite . in these few years , many classes of noncentrosymmetric superconductors ( ncsc )",
    ", the crystal structures of which lack inversion symmetry , have been discovered @xcite .",
    "some experimental and theoretical studies suggest that @xmath3-wave pairing states may be realized in certain systems of ncsc such as cept@xmath5si and li@xmath0pt@xmath5b @xcite .",
    "however , unfortunately , these ncsc are not suitable for the realization of the @xmath4 topological phase , because their superconducting gaps possess nodes @xcite , from which gapless quasiparticles in the bulk appear , and destabilize the topological state . in this paper",
    ", we investigate a possible realization of the @xmath4 topological superconductivity at an interface of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "we consider the @xmath6 interface , at which the rashba - type spin - orbit ( so ) interaction breaking inversion symmetry may be induced @xcite .",
    "we can also consider a setup in which a thin film of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is fabricated on a substrate with a bias potential applied perpendicular to the @xmath6 interface , which controls the strength of the rashba so interaction .",
    "apart from the exploration of the @xmath4 topological superconductivity , such a system is interesting in that it is suitable for the systematic investigation on the effect of party - mixing of pairing states raised by broken inversion symmetry @xcite . for the realization of substantial parity - mixing of cooper pairs , the existence of attractive interactions in both spin - singlet and spin - triplet channels is crucially important .",
    "sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is a good candidate for the realization of such a situation , because , according to microscopic analysis on the mechanism of superconductivity for this system , both the @xmath3-wave channel and the @xmath7-wave channel enjoy substantially strong attractive interactions @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the addition of the asymmetric so interaction to this system raises the strong admixture of spin - singlet pairs and spin - triplet pairs . in general ,",
    "the structure of the parity - mixed cooper pairs is determined by competition between the asymmetric so interaction and pairing interactions in each channel @xcite .",
    "when the asymmetric so interaction is dominant , the structure of the @xmath8-vector for the spin - triplet component is mainly constrained by the so interaction to suppress pairings between two so split bands , which are unfavorable when the so split is much larger than the superconducting gap .",
    "however , in the case that the pairing interaction that is not compatible with the symmetry of the asymmetric",
    "so interaction is dominant , the direction of the @xmath8-vector does not minimize the energy cost due to the asymmetric so interaction , yielding inter - band pairings between the so split bands .",
    "for the case of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , the dominant pairing interaction exists in the @xmath3-wave channel , and the @xmath8-vector is perpendicular to the @xmath9-plane because of the bulk so interaction of the @xmath7-electron orbitals @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider the case that the asymmetric so interaction at the interface is stronger than the bulk so interaction , and examine how the chiral @xmath2 state in the bulk is affected by the asymmetric so interaction , and what pairing symmetry is most stabilized at the interface .",
    "this is another purpose of the current paper .",
    "our main results are as follows .",
    "as the asymmetric so interaction becomes strong , the @xmath8-vector of the @xmath3-wave pairing is oriented to directions parallel to the @xmath9-plane .",
    "however , there exists strong frustration between the asymmetric so interaction and the @xmath3-wave pairing interaction because of an additional anisotropic structure of the pairing interaction .",
    "thus , the direction of the @xmath8-vector does not fully optimize the asymmetric so interaction , inducing substantial amount of cooper pairs between the two so split bands , in spite of the so splitting much larger than the superconducting gap . as a result , the stable pairing state possesses @xmath10 wave symmetry , rather than @xmath11 wave symmetry or @xmath12 wave symmetry which is expected to be stabilized for the rashba superconductors when the inter - band pairs are suppressed @xcite .",
    "the notable feature of the @xmath10 wave state is that the single - particle energy has a full gap , and there are no nodal excitations for small strength of the asymmetric so interaction .",
    "furthermore , since the @xmath8-vector is parallel to the @xmath9-plane , _ time - reversal symmetry is restored _",
    ", which makes sharp contrast with the chiral superconductivity realized in the bulk of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "these two features are quite important for the realization of the @xmath4 topological superconductivity mentioned above .",
    "we can show that the pairing state realized at the interface is topologically equivalent to the combined state of a @xmath2 state and a @xmath13 state , which is time - reversal invariant , and supports the existence of counter - propagating gapless edge modes , which carry spin currents .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the sections 2 and 3 ,",
    "the pairing state at the interface of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is microscopically investigated on the basis of the scenario that the pairing interaction is caused by electron correlation effects .",
    "we analyse the structure of the parity - mixed pairing gap . in the section 4 , exploiting the results obtained in the section 3 , we present a possible scenario for the realization of the @xmath4 topological superconductivity in this system .",
    "discussion and summary are given in the last section .",
    "in this section , we introduce a low - energy effective model for superconductivity realized at an interface of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , and present a theoretical framework used for the study on pairing states .      in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 ,",
    "there exist three quasi 2-dimensional orbitals ru4d@xmath14 in ruo@xmath0 plane for electrons which play the most significant roles for low - energy properties .",
    "there are several theoretical proposals for the microscopic origin of pairing interaction in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "one of promising scenarios is that an effective pairing interaction in the @xmath3-wave channel is produced by higher order processes of electron - electron interaction through the kohn - luttinger - type mechanism @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "which is first proposed by nomura and yamada , among the three bands , @xmath15 and @xmath16-band formed by the @xmath17 orbitals , the @xmath16-band originating from the d@xmath18 orbital is considered to be most important for the realization of the superconductivity . in this paper , we employ this scenario , because this appraoch enables us to calculate the transition temperature which is quantitatively in good agreement with experimental observations . therefore , to discuss the appearance of superconductivity , it is sufficient to focus only on the @xmath16-band .",
    "although there exists the so interaction between the @xmath17 orbitals ( we call this so interaction the bulk so interaction ) which tends to direct the @xmath19-vector parallel to the @xmath20-axis , its effective energy scale for the pinning of the @xmath19-vector is small and negligible for a discussion on the transition temperature @xmath21 .",
    "however , for electrons near the surface or an interface parallel to ruo@xmath0 plane , there exists another kind of spin - orbit interaction called the asymmetric so interaction which breaks both reflection symmetry in the momentum space @xmath22 and spin rotation symmetry .",
    "this so interaction originates from the spin - flip hopping processes between the ru @xmath17 orbitals , of which the wave functions are modulated by a potential gradient in the vicinity of an interface . for the superconductivity",
    ", it tends to make the direction of the @xmath19-vector perpendicular to the @xmath20-axis as shown in section[sec : result1 ] . in the following analysis",
    ", we assume that the asymmetric so interaction is sufficiently stronger than the bulk so interaction , and neglect effects of the bulk so interaction .    we , then , simply describe the electrons of the @xmath16-band near an interface by the single band hubbard model , @xmath23c_k + u\\sum_in_{i\\uparrow}n_{i\\downarrow } ,   \\label{eq : action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the annihilation operator and @xmath25 .",
    "the asymmetric type so interaction induced near the @xmath6-interface is incorporated into the first term of the hamiltonian .",
    "the strength of the asymmetric so interaction is denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "we assume that the rashba form of the asymmetric so interaction @xcite . for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 ,",
    "the dispersion relation @xmath27 and the rashba type so interaction are approximated by @xmath28 the parameters are fixed as @xmath29 taking @xmath30 as the energy unit , and the filling is @xmath31 .",
    "the hopping integral and the electron density are chosen so that the fermi surface of our model is consistent with the experiments . in the real system , the form of @xmath32 may be more complicated .",
    "however , as will be shown in the section 3 , this simplified model captures important physics raised by broken inversion symmetry .",
    "there are some theoretical proposals for the mechanism of @xmath3-wave superconductivity realized in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "one promising scenario is that the pairing interaction in this system is caused by the kohn - luttinger mechanism ; higher order interaction processes due to the coulomb interactions @xmath33 give rise to effective pairing interactions in interaction channels with nonzero angular momentum @xcite .",
    "actually , nomura and yamada demonstrated that interaction processes up to the third order in @xmath33 yield a strong pairing interaction in the @xmath3-wave channel for the microscopic model of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "this scenario successfully explains the origin of the @xmath3-wave superconductivity realized in this system .",
    "we , here , apply this perturbation theory for the pairing interaction to the model ( [ eq : action ] ) .    for this purpose , we introduce noninteracting green s function , @xmath34 where @xmath35 ^ 2}$ ] .",
    "@xmath36 is the fermionic matsubara frequency .",
    "as seen in the form of @xmath37 , the fermi surface splits into two bands whose dispersions are @xmath38 and @xmath39 with the splitting @xmath40 ( @xmath41 is the averaged fermi velocity of the two bands ) .",
    "note that @xmath42 at the van hove points @xmath43 and the fermi surface is changed little around them since the rashba so interaction is small there .",
    "the effective pairing interaction is expanded up to the third order with respect to @xmath33 .",
    "it is expressed as , @xmath44,\\\\ v^{{\\rm rpa}}_{\\sigma\\bar{\\sigma}\\sigma\\bar{\\sigma}}(k , k^{\\prime})&= & u+u^2\\chi^0(k+k^{\\prime } ) + u^3[\\left(\\chi^0(k - k^{\\prime})\\right)^2 + \\left(\\chi^0(k+k^{\\prime})\\right)^2],\\\\ v^{{\\rm ver}}_{\\sigma\\bar{\\sigma}\\sigma\\bar{\\sigma}}(k , k^{\\prime})&= & 2u^3{\\rm re}\\sum_{q}g^0_{\\sigma \\sigma}(-k+q)[\\chi^0(q ) g^0_{\\sigma \\sigma}(-k^{\\prime}+q ) -\\phi^0(q)g^0_{\\sigma \\sigma}(k^{\\prime}+q)],\\\\ v^{{\\rm rpa}}_{\\sigma\\sigma\\sigma\\sigma}(k , k^{\\prime})&= & -u^2[\\chi^0(k - k^{\\prime } ) -\\chi^0(k+k^{\\prime})],\\\\ v^{{\\rm ver}}_{\\sigma\\sigma\\sigma\\sigma}(k , k^{\\prime})&= & 2u^3{\\rm re}\\sum_{q}g^0_{\\sigma \\sigma}(k+q ) [ \\chi^0(q)+\\phi^0(q ) ] [ g^0_{\\sigma \\sigma}(k^{\\prime}+q)-g^0_{\\sigma \\sigma}(-k^{\\prime}+q)],\\\\ v_{\\sigma\\bar{\\sigma}\\bar{\\sigma}\\sigma}(k , k^{\\prime } ) & = & -v_{\\sigma\\bar{\\sigma}\\sigma \\bar{\\sigma}}(k ,- k^{\\prime}),\\\\ { \\rm others}&=&0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are , respectively , temperature and the number of ru sites . @xmath49 and @xmath50 do not depend on spins because @xmath51 is satisfied .",
    "we , here , neglect many terms in @xmath52 which arise from non - zero off - diagonal elements of green s function @xmath53 , because @xmath53 is smaller than @xmath54 by the factor of @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the fermi energy .",
    "besides , the terms in @xmath52 with spin - flip processes represent the perturbative effects of the rashba so interaction and , in itself , do not have crucial importance as long as @xmath57 .",
    "each @xmath58 consists of the rpa - like terms @xmath59 and the vertex - correction terms @xmath60 .",
    "the former is included within random phase approximation(rpa ) , and the latter is not . for spin - singlet pairing , the rpa - like terms give dominant attractive interaction and play significant roles for its stability , while the vertex - correction terms do for triplet pairing .",
    "the transition temperatures for the superconductivity are calculated by solving the linearized eliashberg equation @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the anomalous self - energy and @xmath63 is the eigenvalue .",
    "we identify the temperature for which @xmath64 as the transition temperature . the normal self - energy is neglected because it is not important in the present study . in this equation ,",
    "spin - flip processes are included only in the factor @xmath65 and are not in @xmath52 within our approximation .",
    "this is because the factor @xmath65 behaves like a window function which allows electrons only near the fermi surface to participate in the superconductivity and therefore has non - perturbative effects of the rashba so interaction , while the spin - flip scattering processes in @xmath52 are perturbative .",
    "we note that some of the elements of @xmath66 are strongly anisotropic in the @xmath67-space , which restrict the possible symmetries of the gap functions .",
    "furthermore , these elements with @xmath68 or @xmath69 give rise to parity - mixing between spin - singlet and spin - triplet pairs , which is one of the most remarkable features of ncsc .",
    "the anomalous self - energy is generally written as , @xmath70i\\sigma_2 , \\label{eq : d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the singlet and triplet parts , respectively , and the @xmath67-dependence of @xmath73 represents the symmetry of the superconductivity .",
    "the structure of the @xmath19-vector @xmath74 is determined by the two factors .",
    "one is the pairing interaction @xmath52 and , in the case of rashba superconductors , there exists the other factor @xmath75 .",
    "the microscopic origins of these two factors are generally different , and the @xmath19-vector which @xmath52 favors does not necessarily coincide with the one which @xmath75 favors . for sufficiently large @xmath26 with @xmath76 , the most stable direction of the @xmath19-vector",
    "is @xmath77 because , if this condition is satisfied , @xmath78 in the matrix form can be diagonalized with respect to the @xmath79 bands .",
    "conversely , when @xmath74 is not parallel to @xmath80 , inter - band pairs between the so split bands are induced , which generally lead to pair - breaking effects .",
    "in contrast , for enough small @xmath26 , the structure of @xmath74 is determined by the pairing interaction .",
    "generally , these two factors which can determine the structure of the @xmath19-vector compete with each other . in the next section",
    ", we discuss the effects of the rashba so interaction on the transition temperature and the structure of @xmath81 .    to solve the eliashberg equation ( [ eq : eliashberg ] ) numerically , we divide the brillouin zone into @xmath82 meshes and take 1024 matsubara frequencies .",
    "in this section , we present the results for stable pairing states and their transition temperatures calculated by using the formulation given in the section 2 .",
    "we first show the momentum profile of @xmath83 in figure [ fig : chi ] for @xmath84 and @xmath85 at @xmath86 , which plays an important role for the pairing mechanism .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we , next , consider the adiabatic deformation of the above @xmath87 wave state to a topologically equivalent state .",
    "this deformation is achieved by changing parameters of the hamiltonian without closing the bulk gap @xcite . since any gradual changes of parameters can not change the nonzero topological number which is discrete , the existence of the bulk gap ensures the topological stability of the state . as mentioned above , for @xmath88",
    ", @xmath89 holds .",
    "thus we can change adiabatically the magnitude of the spin - singlet gap @xmath90 and the strength of the so interaction @xmath26 to zero without closing the excitation gap . after this deformation , the system is equivalent to a combined system of a @xmath2 state and a @xmath13 state , which indeed exhibits the @xmath4 topological superconductivity @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath87 wave state obtained in the section 3 is topologically equivalent to the @xmath4 topological superconductivity . in this @xmath4 topological phase , there are counter - propagating gapless edge states , which are majorana fermions @xcite",
    ". the majorana edge states may give rise to intriguing transport phenomena associated with spin currents @xcite . since there is a diamagnetic supercurrent on the boundary surface , for the detection of the spin current carried by edge quasiparticles , thermomagnetic effects",
    "may be utilized @xcite .",
    "also , the gapless edge quasiparticles may be observed as a zero bias peak of tunneling currents @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated pairing states realized at the @xmath6 interface of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 by using microscopic calculations based on the kohn - luttinger - type pairing mechanism .",
    "it is found that at the ( 001 ) interface of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , the strong admixture of @xmath3-wave pairings and @xmath7-wave pairings realizes , and thus this system is suitable for the exploration of strong parity - mixing of cooper pairs caused by broken inversion symmetry .",
    "an important implication of our results is as follows .",
    "when there are strong spin - triplet pairing correlations in ncsc , the frustration between the pairing interaction and the asymmetric so interaction occurs quite generally , because of incompatibility between the pairing interaction and the symmetry of the asymmetric so interaction .",
    "this yields substantial spin - triplet inter - band pairs between electrons in two so split bands , even when the size of the so split is considerably larger than the superconducting gap .",
    "because of this feature , the most stable parity - mixed pairing state realized at the ( 001 ) interface of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is the @xmath87 wave state , in which time - reversal symmetry is restored , in contrast to the bulk sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , which is believed to be in the chiral @xmath2 state with broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "another intriguing conclusion drawn from our results is that this @xmath87 wave state can be a promising candidate of the recently - proposed @xmath4 topological superconductivity .",
    "that is , the @xmath87 wave state is topologically equivalent to the state that consists of a @xmath2 state for @xmath91 pairs and a @xmath13 state for @xmath92 pairs , which supports the existence of counter - propagating gapless edge states carrying spin currents .",
    "this feature may be observed experimentally in the transport properties for heat currents and spin currents , as discussed in some literature @xcite .",
    "some concluding remarks are in order .",
    "for the spin - triplet pairing state obtained in the above analysis , inter - band pair correlation between the so split bands is substantially large .",
    "this result for inter - band pairings implies that pairing states with center - of - mass momentum such as the fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinikov ( fflo ) state  @xcite may be more stabilized for some parameter regions compared to uniform states considered in the current paper .",
    "the stability of the fflo state depends on competition between pairing interaction for this state and the cost of the kinetic energy due to the finite center - of - mass momentum .",
    "the issue of a possible realization of the fflo state at an interface of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is quite intriguing , and should be addressed in the near future .    in the argument for the realization of the topological superconductivity presented in this paper , we did not consider effects of the bulk so interaction due to the @xmath7-electron orbitals , but simply assumed that the asymmetric so interaction overwhelms the bulk so interaction in the vicinity of the interface",
    "actually , there should exist a domain boundary between the chiral @xmath2 state in the bulk governed by the bulk so interaction and the time - reversal - invariant @xmath10 state near the interface .",
    "it is highly nontrivial how the interaction between these two states affects the stability of the topological superconductivity .",
    "however , it is expected that as long as the thickness of the region , where the asymmetric so interaction is dominant , is sufficiently large compared to the coherence length of cooper pairs , the topological superconductivity should be stable in the vicinity of the interface . another point required for the realization of the topological superconductivity is the fabrication of the interface where the electronic structure is not so different from the bulk one . in the ( 001 ) surface of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , however , it is known that a structural phase transition occurs and the surface state is ferromagnetic@xcite . to observe the time - reversal symmetric superconductivity , a very carefully fabricated sample without such a structural phase transition is needed .",

    "<S> we investigate pairing states realized at the ( 001 ) interface of a spin - triplet superconductor sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 on the basis of microscopic calculations . </S>",
    "<S> because of a rashba - type spin - orbit interaction induced at the interface , strong parity - mixing of cooper pairs between a spin - singlet state and a spin - triplet state occurs in this system . </S>",
    "<S> there are also strong inter - band pair correlations between the spin - orbit split bands , in spite of the considerably large spin - orbit splitting . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to frustration between the spin - orbit interaction and pairing interactions . in this pairing state , </S>",
    "<S> time - reversal symmetry is restored , in contrast to the bulk sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 which is believed to be a chiral @xmath2 superconductor with broken time - reversal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that , because of these features , the pairing state at the interface is a promising candidate for the recently proposed time - reversal invariant topological superconductor . </S>"
