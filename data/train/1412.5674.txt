    "* ) , the primary _ kepler _  mission came to an end in in may 2013 with the failure of the second of four reaction wheels used to stabilize the spacecraft . without at least three functioning reaction wheels ,",
    "the spacecraft is unable to achieve the fine pointing necessary for high photometric precision on the original target field .",
    "however , an extended mission called k2 was enabled by pointing along the ecliptic plane and balancing the spacecraft against solar radiation pressure to mitigate the instability caused by the failed reaction wheels .",
    "the recently extended k2 mission enables renewed opportunities for transit science on a new set of bright target stars , albeit with somewhat reduced photometric precision compared to the original _ kepler _  mission @xcite .    searching for transiting exoplanets around bright , nearby stars",
    "is important because measuring the precise masses and radii of transiting planets allows for characterization of their interior structures and atmospheres @xcite .",
    "this is particularly desirable for planets with masses intermediate to those of the earth and uranus , commonly referred to as super ",
    "earths , because no such planet exists in our solar system @xcite .",
    "however , while the radii of _ kepler _  planets are often measured to high precision @xcite , their masses are generally unknown because the host stars are faint ( @xmath10 ) and exposure times needed for radial velocity ( rv ) measurements are prohibitive for all but the brightest _ kepler _ planet candidates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "preparations for the extended two  wheeled _ kepler _  mission included a 9day test of the new observing mode in february of 2014 .",

    "* hereafter vj14 ) presented a photometric reduction technique that accounts for the motion of the spacecraft , improves photometric precision of raw k2 data by a factor of 25 , and enables photometric precision comparable to that of the original _ kepler _  mission .    while the data collected during the engineering test were intended primarily as a test of the new spacecraft operating mode , inspection of light curves produced with this technique nonetheless revealed a single transit event in engineering data taken of hip116454 . in this paper",
    ", we provide an analysis of that light curve along with archival and follow  up spectroscopy , archival and adaptive optics imaging , radial velocity measurements from the harps - n spectrograph , and photometric observations from the wide angle search for planets ( wasp ) survey and the microvariability and oscillations of stars ( most ) space telescope .",
    "these measurements allow us to verify and characterize the first planet discovered by the two - wheeled _ kepler _  mission , a new transiting super - earth orbiting the bright , nearby , high - proper - motion k dwarf hip116454 .",
    "hip116454  and nearly 2000 other stars were observed by the _ kepler _  spacecraft from 4 february 2014 until 12 february 2014 during the _ kepler _  two - wheel concept engineering test .",
    "after the first 2.5 days of the test , _ kepler _  underwent a large , intentional adjustment to its pointing to move its target stars to the center of their apertures , where they stayed for the last 6.5 days of the test .",
    "we downloaded the full engineering test dataset from the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) , and reduced the _ kepler _  target pixel files as described in vj14 .    in brief",
    ", we extracted raw aperture photometry and image centroid positions from the _ kepler _  target pixel files .",
    "raw k2 photometry is dominated by jagged events corresponding to the motion of the spacecraft , as _ kepler _ s pointing drifts due to solar radiation pressure and is periodically corrected with thrusters . for the last 6.5 days after the large pointing tweak , we removed the systematics due to the motion of the spacecraft by correlating the measured flux with the image centroid positions measured from photometry .",
    "we essentially produced a `` self  flat  field '' ( sff ) similar to those produced by , for instance , @xcite , for analysis of _ spitzer _  photometry .",
    "we fit a piecewise linear function to the measured dependence of flux on centroid position , with outlier exclusion to preserve transit events , and removed the dependence on centroid position from the raw light curve . similarly to vj14 , we excluded datapoints taken while _ kepler _",
    "s thrusters were firing from our reduced light curves because these data were typically outliers from the corrected light curves . for hip116454 , the median absolute deviation ( mad ) of the 30 minute long - cadence datapoints improved from @xmath11 parts per million ( ppm ) for the raw light curve , to @xmath12 50 ppm for the sff light curve",
    ".    visual inspection of light curves from the @xmath12 2000 targets observed during the engineering test revealed a one millimagnitude ( mmag ) deep candidate transit in photometry of hip116454 , designated epic60021410 by the _ kepler _  team .",
    "raw and corrected k2 photometry for hip116454  are shown in figure [ sff ] .",
    "we fit a @xcite model to the transit and measured a total duration of approximately 2.25 hours , and a planet  to  star radius ratio of approximately 0.03 .",
    "unfortunately , the data point during transit ingress happened during a thruster firing event , and was excluded by our pipeline .",
    "this particular data point does not appear to be anomalous , but we choose to exclude it to minimize risk of contaminating the transit with an outlier .",
    "slow photometric variability , presumably due to starspot modulation , is evident in the k2 light curve at the sub - percent level .",
    "we also performed a similar sff correction to the data taken in the 2.5 days of data before the large pointing tweak .",
    "even though the resulting data quality is somewhat worse , we are able to confidently exclude any other events of a similar depth during that time .",
    "because k2 only observed one transit event , we were not able to measure a precise orbital period for the planet candidate . nonetheless , we were able to put rough constraints on the orbital period from our knowledge of the transit duration and estimates of the stellar properties .",
    "the nine - day time baseline of the k2 observations allowed us to constrain the period of the candidate transiting planet to be greater than 5 days . to put a rough upper bound on the allowed planet period",
    ", we compared the transit duration of the candidate transit around hip116454  to the distribution of transit durations from the ensemble of _ kepler _  planet candidates ( retrieved from the nasa exoplanet archive ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we found that of the 413 _ kepler _  planet candidates with transit durations between 2 and 2.5 hours , 93% had orbital periods shorter than 20 days . because transit duration is a function of the mean stellar density , we repeated this calculation while restricting the sample to the 64 planet candidates with transit durations between 2 and 2.5 hours and host star effective temperatures within 200  k of hip116454 .",
    "we find that similarly , 94% of these candidates had orbital periods shorter than 20 days .",

    "hip116454  was observed in the national geographic society  palomar observatory sky survey ( poss - i ) on 28 november 1951 .",
    "hip116454  has a proper motion of 303  mas  yr@xmath16 @xcite , and therefore has moved nearly 20 arcseconds with respect to background sources since being imaged in poss - i .",
    "inspection of the poss - i image reveals no background objects within the k2 aperture used in our photometric reduction .",
    "we show the poss - i blue image overlaid with the k2 photometric aperture in figure [ imaging]a .",
    "the poss - i survey has a limiting magnitude of 21.1 in the blue bandpass @xcite , 10 magnitudes fainter than hip116454 .",
    "the depth of the detected transit is 0.1% , so if a background eclipsing binary were responsible the depth would correspond to a total eclipse of a star 7.5 magnitudes fainter . a low  proper  motion background star such as that would have readily been detected in poss - i imaging .",
    "we conclude that our aperture is free of background objects whose eclipses could masquerade as planet transits .",
    "the poss - i imaging also reveals a companion star about 8 arcseconds to the southwest of hip116454 .",
    "the companion is not fully resolved in poss - i because the photographic plate was saturated by the bright primary star , but an asymmetry in the stellar image is visible .",
    "hip116454  was also observed during the second palomar observatory sky survey ( poss - ii ) on 31 august 1992 .",
    "improvements in photographic plate technology over the previous forty years allowed the companion star to be resolved .",
    "the companion shares a common proper motion with the primary at a projected distance of @xmath11  au , so we conclude the two stars are a gravitationally  bound visual binary system .",
    "hip116454  was observed during the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , and the secondary star was detected @xcite .",
    "the secondary star falls on a diffraction spike caused by the much brighter primary star , but the sdss pipeline flagged its photometry as `` acceptable . ''",
    "the sdss photometry indicates that the secondary star is 67 magnitudes fainter than the primary depending on the filter , so because the two stars are gravitationally associated , the secondary must be intrinsically much fainter than the k  dwarf primary .",
    "this implies that the companion must either be a late m  dwarf or a white dwarf .",
    "the sdss colors are relatively flat , indicating a hot star . to quantify this",
    ", we fit the _ ugri _ sdss colors to a blackbody model , excluding _ z _ due to its low throughput and assuming photometric errors of 5% .",
    "we included no corrections for extinction due to the proximity of the target and our ability to accurately predict broadband photometry using stellar models in section [ stellarproperties ] .",
    "we find that the data are best described by an object radiating at a temperature of @xmath30  k. we used the stefan  boltzmann law combined with the _ hipparcos _  parallax and derived temperature to estimate a radius of @xmath31 , which is consistent with our white dwarf hypothesis .",
    "using a simple analytic white dwarf cooling law @xcite , we estimate a cooling age of the white dwarf of @xmath32 gyr . the formal uncertainty on the cooling age is 0.2 gyr , but this neglects uncertainties due to the unknown composition of the white dwarf and inaccuracies in the simple model .",
    "the true uncertainty on this quantity is likely on order of a factor of two @xcite .",
    "the cooling age of the white dwarf is a lower limit on the age of the system , and the total age of the system is the sum of the main sequence lifetime of the progenitor and the white dwarf s cooling age .",
    "the secondary star is close enough to the primary that it is blended in the k2 image and is bright enough that if it were a totally eclipsing binary , it could cause the transit event we observed .",
    "this situation is unlikely because the duration and minimum period of the event are generally inconsistent with an object eclipsing a white dwarf . with the baseline of k2 data we can exclude orbital periods shorter than 5 days .",
    "while 5day period companions eclipsing main sequence stars are common , and have relatively high transit probabilities , the probability of a transit or eclipse goes as @xmath33 at a given stellar mass and orbital period . furthermore , in order for an earth sized object eclipsing a white dwarf to have an eclipse duration of two hours , the orbital period would have to be roughly 600 years in the case of a circular orbit and impact parameter @xmath34 .",
    "even with a highly elliptical orbit transiting at apastron , which is _ a priori _ unlikely , the orbital period would be of order centuries , and the semimajor axis would be roughly 50  au .",
    "the probability of an orbit such as that eclipsing the white dwarf is @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the semimajor axis and @xmath37 is the radius of the occulting body . in the worst ",
    "case scenario of a non - luminous jupiter sized object occulting the white dwarf , the orbital period would have to be on order 3 years and have a semimajor axis of roughly 1.5 au , correpsonding to a transit probability of @xmath38 .",
    "we conclude that the transit event we observed was far more likely caused by a short  period planet orbiting the primary star than a long period object eclipsing the secondary .",
    "we also obtained high  angular  resolution imaging of the primary star to rule out any very close associated companions .",
    "we observed hip116454  with the robo - ao laser adaptive optics and imaging system on the 60inch telescope at palomar observatory @xcite .",
    "we obtained seven images with robo - ao between 15 june 2014 and 11 july 2014 in three different bandpasses : sloan @xmath26band , sloan @xmath39band , and a long  pass filter with a cutoff at 600  nm ( lp600 ) which more closely approximates the _ kepler _  bandpass .",
    "each observation consisted of a series of images read out from the detector at a maximum rate of 8.6  hz , for a total integration time of 90 seconds .",
    "the frames were co  added in post - processing using a shift and add technique with hip116454  as the tip  tilt guide star .",
    "the quality of the robo - ao images varied between the observations , but none of the images showed evidence for companions within 3 magnitudes of the primary outside of 0.2 arcseconds .",
    "some but not all of the images , however , showed an elongation that could be consistent with a bright close binary companion at a separation of 0.15 arcseconds at the < 5@xmath40 level , similar to koi 1962 in @xcite .    to investigate this possibility",
    "further , we obtained higher resolution adaptive optics images on 2 august 2014 using the keck ii natural guide star adaptive optics ( ngsao ) system with the nirc2 narrow detector at keck observatory .",
    "we obtained unsaturated frames of hip116454  in @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29-band filters to search for close companions near the diffraction limit ( @xmath4140  mas in @xmath28-band ) .",
    "we also acquired deeper , saturated images in @xmath28 ( 70  sec total ) and @xmath29-bands ( 200 sec total ) with the primary positioned in the lower right quadrant of the array and rotated so the white dwarf companion falls in the field of view .",
    "we calibrated and processed the data as described in @xcite .",
    "we corrected the data for optical aberrations using the distortion solution from b. cameron ( 2007 , priv .",
    "communication ) and north - aligned the images using the detector orientation measured by @xcite .",
    "we found no evidence for the companion suggested by some of the robo - ao data .",

    "hip116454  was observed 9 times for the carney - latham proper motion survey @xcite with the cfa digital speedometer spectrograph over the course of 9.1 years from 1982 until 1991 .",
    "the digital speedometer measured radial velocities to a precision of approximately 0.3  km  s@xmath16 , and detected no significant radial velocity variations or trends in the velocities of hip116454 . when corrected into an absolute radial velocity frame ,",
    "the digital speedometer measurements indicate an absolute radial velocity of @xmath43  km  s@xmath16  and when combined with proper motion , a space velocity of @xmath44  km  s@xmath16 .",
    "this somewhat unusual space velocity corresponds to an elliptical orbit in the plane of the galaxy , indicating that hip116454  originated far from the stellar neighborhood .",
    "a detailed analysis of hip116454 s elemental abundances could reveal patterns that are dissimilar to stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "we obtained three observations of hip116454  in june of 2014 with the tillinghast reflector echelle spectrograph ( tres ) on the 1.5 m tillinghast reflector at the fred l. whipple observatory .",
    "the spectra were taken with a resolving power of @xmath45 with a signal  to  noise ratio ( snr ) of approximately 50 per resolution element . when corrected into an absolute radial velocity frame ,",
    "the tres spectra indicate an absolute radial velocity for hip116454  of @xmath46  km  s@xmath16 .",
    "when combined with the absolute radial velocities from the digital speedometer , there is no evidence for radial velocity variation of greater than 100  m  s@xmath16  over the course of 30 years .",
    "the three individual radial velocities from the tres spectra revealed no variability at the level of 20  m  s@xmath16  over the course of eight days .",
    "we also find no evidence for a second set of stellar lines in the cross correlation function used to measure the radial velocities , which rules out many possible close companions or background stars .",
    "when the adaptive optics constraints are combined with a lack of radial velocity variability of more than 100 m / s over 30 years and the lack of a second set of spectral lines in the cross correlation function , we can effectively exclude any close stellar companions to hip116454 .",
    "we obtained 44 spectra of hip116454  on 33 different nights between july and october of 2014 with the harps - n spectrograph @xcite on the 3.57 m telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) on la palma island , spain to measure precise radial velocities and determine the orbit and mass of the transiting planet .",
    "each harps - n spectrum was taken with a resolving power of @xmath47 , and each measurement consisted of a 15 minute exposure , yielding a snr of 50100 per resolution element at 550  nm , depending on weather conditions .",
    "the corresponding ( formal ) radial velocity precision ranged from 0.90  m  s@xmath16  to 2.35  m  s@xmath16 .",
    "radial velocities were extracted by calculating the weighted cross correlation function of the spectrum with a binary mask @xcite . in some cases",
    ", we took one 15 minute exposure per night , and in other cases , we took two 15 minute exposures back - to - back . in the latter case we measured the two consecutive radial velocities individually and",
    "report the average value .",
    "the harps - n radial velocity measurements are listed in table [ rvs ] , and are shown in figure [ rvplot ] . a periodic radial velocity variation with a period of about nine days and a semiamplitude of about 4  m  s@xmath16  is evident in the rv time series .",
    "we checked that we identified the correct periodicity by calculating a lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite , shown in figure [ periodogram ] .",
    "we found a strong peak at a period of 9.1 days and an aliased peak of similar strength with a period close to 1 day , corresponding to the daily sampling alias of the 9.1 day signal ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we estimated the false alarm probability of the rv detection by scrambling the rv data and recalculating the periodogram numerous times , and counting which fraction of the scrambled periodograms have periods with higher power than the unscrambled periodogram .",
    "we found that the false alarm probability of the 9.1 day periodicity is significantly less than @xmath48 .",
    "in addition to the 9.1 day signal , we also found evidence for a weaker 45 day periodic rv variation.to help decide whether to include the second periodicity in our rv modeling , we fit the harps - n radial velocities with both a one - planet and a two - planet keplerian model .",
    "the one planet model was a keplerian function parameterized by : @xmath49 , time of transit , @xmath50,@xmath51 , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the planet s orbital period , @xmath54 is the orbital eccentricity , and @xmath55 is the argument of periastron .",
    "we also fit for a radial velocity zero - point and a stellar jitter term , for a total of 7 free parameters .",
    "we fit each of these parameters with an unbounded uniform prior except for @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which had uniform priors over the interval between -1 and 1 .",
    "the two planet model was the sum of two keplerian functions , each of which was parameterized by : @xmath49 , time of transit , @xmath56,@xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "once again , we also fit for a radial velocity zero point and stellar jitter term , for a total of 12 free parameters .",
    "we fit each of these parameters with an unbounded uniform prior except for @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which had uniform priors over the interval between -1 and 1 , and for @xmath57 , the period of the outer planet , which we constrained to be between the period of the inner planet and 1000 days .",
    "we performed the fits using _ emcee _",
    "@xcite , a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm with an affine invariant ensemble sampler .",
    "we note that upon exploring various different periods for the outer planet , our mcmc analysis found the 45 day period to be optimal .",
    "we calculated the bayesian information criterion ( bic , * ? ? ? * ) to estimate the relative likelihoods of the two models .",
    "while the bic does not provide a definitive or exact comparison of the fully marginalized likelihoods of the models , it allows us to roughly estimate the relative likelihoods . upon calculating the bic",
    ", we estimate that the two - planet model is favored over the one - planet model with confidence @xmath58 . from here on , we therefore model the radial velocity observations as the sum of two keplerian functions .    for both periods",
    ", we find an amplitude consistent with that of a transiting super - earth .",
    "the nine - day periodicity in the rvs is consistent with the orbital period we estimated from the duration of the k2 transit event .",
    "we `` predicted '' the time of transit for the nine day period planet during the k2 observations , and found that the harps - n measurements alone constrain the expected time of transit to better than one day , and we find that the k2 transit event is consistent with the transit ephemeris predicted by only the harps - n rvs at the 68.3% ( 1-@xmath40 ) level .",
    "we show the k2 light curve with the transit window derived from only the harps - n rvs in figure [ transitwindow ] .",
    "thus , the 9.1 day periodicity is consistent with being caused by a transiting planet . the more tenuous 45 day",
    "periodic variation , on the other hand , may be due to to an outer planet , but it may also be caused by stellar variability .",
    "the harps - n spectra include regions used to calculate activity indicators such as the mount wilson s@xmath59 index and the r@xmath60 index ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we calculated the s@xmath59 index for each harps - n spectrum and found a mean value of 0.275 @xmath61 0.0034 , and an associated @xmath62 .",
    "there were no obvious correlations between the s@xmath59 index and either the measured rv or the residuals to either a one or two planet keplerian fit .",

    "a constraint or measurement of the rotation period consistent with the possible 45 day periodicity in radial velocities could affect our interpretation of the signal .",
    "we only used photometric measurements for our analysis given the relatively short time coverage and sparseness of the spectroscopic observations .",
    "we first started by analyzing the wasp data only , because its time baseline far exceeded that of the k2 and most data .",

    "we evaluated the significance of this peak by scrambling the binned data , recalculating the lomb - scargle periodograms , and counting the number of times the maximum resulting power was greater than the power in the 16 day peak .",

    "we did not find any convincing signals in the second ( 2009 ) or third ( 2010 ) observing seasons .",

    "we concluded that the wasp data showed a candidate rotation period at 16 days , but the relatively high false alarm probability and lack of consistency between observing seasons precluded a confident detection .",
    "after our analysis of the wasp data yielded suggestive yet ambiguous results , we attempted to measure the rotation period of hip116454  by fitting all of the photometric data with a gaussian process noise model .",

    "we conducted our analysis using _",
    "@xcite , a gaussian process library that employs hierarchical off - diagonal low rank systems ( hodlr ) , a fast matrix inversion method @xcite .",
    "we used the following kernel function in our analysis :    @xmath76\\exp\\left[\\frac{-\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi(x_i - x_j)}{p}\\right)}{g_q^2}\\right],\\ ] ]    where @xmath77 is the amplitude of correlation , @xmath78 is the timescale of exponential decay , @xmath79 is a scaling factor for the exponentiated sinusoidal term and @xmath53 is the rotation period .",
    "an additional hyperparameter , @xmath80 was used to account for additional white noise in the time series , where @xmath80 is added to the individual measurement uncertainties in quadrature .",
    "we modeled the three continuous periods of most data , the three seasons of wasp data , and the k2 photometry simultaneously , with @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath53 constrained to be the same across all seven data sets and with @xmath80 allowed to take a different value for each .",

    "the resulting posterior distribution was not well constrained , with significant power at essentially all rotation periods greater than about 8 days and less than about 50 days .",
    "there were a few periods which seemed to be preferred to some extent in the posterior distribution  a strong peak at 12 days , and weaker peaks at 16 , 20 , and 32 days .",
    "we conclude that with our data , we can not conclusively identify a rotation period for hip116454 , which leaves us unable to rule out stellar activity as the cause of the 45 day signal in the radial velocities .",

    "* ) , and different assumptions about the envelope s composition and age does not change the calculated thickness and mass of the gaseous envelope by more than a factor of two . we note that this envelope fraction is consistent with the population of _ kepler _  super - earth / sub - neptune sized planets studied by @xcite , who found the envelope fraction of these candidates to be distributed around 1% with a scatter of 0.5 dex .",
    "we also explored the composition of hip116454b  assuming it is solid and has little in the way of a gaseous envelope using an online tool , based on the model grids of @xcite .",
    "we investigated a three  component model , with layers of h@xmath130o , mgsio@xmath131  and fe . in this case , hip116454b  must have a significant fraction of either h@xmath130o  or other volatiles in an ice form like methane or ammonia .",
    "the composition in this case would be more similar to the ice giants in the solar system than the rocky planets like earth .",
    "we find that the pressure at the core of the planet can range from 1400  gpa for an iron  free planet to 2800  gpa for a silicate ",
    "free planet . assuming a ratio of iron to silicates similar to that of the earth and other solar system bodies , we find that the core pressure of hip116454b  is about 2400  gpa . under this assumption , hip116454b  would consist of 8% fe,17% mgsio@xmath131 and 75% h@xmath130o  by mass . using the ratio of iron to silicates in solar system bodies is usually a relatively good assumption because this ratio is largely determined by element synthesis cosmochemistry , which does not vary greatly on the scale of 50 parsecs .",
    "however , hip116454 s unusual space motion indicates that it might have formed elsewhere in the galaxy , so this assumption might not hold .",
    "more detailed spectral analysis , in particular measuring elemental abundances for mg and si compared to fe in the parent star could put additional constraints on the composition of hip116454b assuming it is solid .",

    "various evidence points to hip116454  having an age of approximately 2 gyr . using relations from @xcite",

    "the white dwarf s cooling age , however , sets a lower limit of approximately 1.3 gyr .",
    "future observations , like a mass measurement of the white dwarf to estimate its progenitor s mass ( and therefore age on the main sequence ) , could constrain the age further . if hip116454 s age is indeed",
    "about 2 gyr and the planet lacks a gaseous envelope , then it is likely to have water in plasma phases near its water - silicate boundary ( the bottom of the h@xmath130o  layer ) , while if it is slightly older ( @xmath41 3 gyr or more ) , or has a faster cooling rate , it could have superionic phases of water .",
    "hip116454b  is a promising transiting super - earth for follow  up observations due to the brightness of its star , especially in the near infrared .",
    "we used the exoplanet orbit database @xcite to compare hip116454b  to other transiting sub - neptune sized planets orbiting bright stars .",

    "atmospheric studies with transit transmission spectroscopy can help determine whether these planets are in fact solid or have a gaseous envelope , and give a better understanding on how these planets form and why they are so common in the galaxy . also of interest",
    "is the fact that hip116454b  is very similar to hd97658b , in terms of its orbital characteristics ( both are in @xmath41 10 day low - eccentricity orbits ) , mass and radius ( within 10% in radius , and within 25% in mass ) , and stellar hosts ( both orbit k  dwarfs ) .",
    "comparative studies of these two super  earths will be valuable for understanding the diversity and possible origins of close  in super ",
    "earths around sun  like stars .",
    "this being said , despite hip116454 s brightness , the relatively shallow transit depth will make it a somewhat less efficient target than super - earths orbiting smaller stars ( for instance , gj 1214 b , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "many _ kepler _  planet candidates were confirmed in part thanks to precise measurements of the _ kepler _  image centroid as the planet transited  the expected motion of the image centroid could be calculated based on the brightness and position of other stars near the aperture , and deviations from that prediction could signal the presence of a false  positive planet candidate",
