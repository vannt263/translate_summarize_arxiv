    "the physics of sns junctions of microscopic size have attracted a greal deal of attention recently@xcite .",
    "a variety of experiments can be understood by modelling the constriction by a number of one dimensional superconducting channels in parallel@xcite .",
    "each channel is described in terms of its transmission coefficient .",
    "this model assumes that , at finite voltages , the potential drop occurs in a normal region close to the barrier .",
    "the size of this region is implicitly fixed when specifying the boundary conditions for the quasiparticle wavefunctions in the two superconducting leads .",
    "the matching conditions used so far are equivalent to the assumption that the width of the normal region is much smaller than other relevant length scales in the system , such as the coherence length , @xmath0 .",
    "if this is the case , anderson s theorem can be used to justify the lack of variation of the superconducting properties of the leads in the proximity of the constriction@xcite .",
    "corrections to the preceding picture are expected when the potential drop , and the effective barrier region are of sizes comparable to the scales which determine the superconducting properties .",
    "we can expect that , near the constriction of size @xmath1 , the mean free path of the superconductor , @xmath2 , will not exceed @xmath1 .",
    "the effective coherence length is given by @xmath3 .",
    "according to anderson s theorem , the relative corrections to the superconducting properties due to imperfections of size @xmath4 are of order @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the small parameter which justifies the existence of an abrupt barrier at the junction is @xmath6 . for contact regions @xmath7 nm and larger ,",
    "these effects need not be negligible for materials such as al , and should be more relevant for pb or nb junctions .    in this work ,",
    "we analyze the leading corrections to the abrupt barrier limit by assuming that the barrier region has an internal structure .",
    "we allow the transmission of the central region to depend on energy .",
    "the simplest such situation is to consider that the junction is made up of two barriers , which define the central region of the contact , and that that transport is ballistic in between the barriers .",
    "recent experiments suggest that such a geometry can be manufactured with existing technologies@xcite .",
    "the study of microscopic models of andreev reflections was started in 1982 by blonder et al @xcite , who analyzed the current which flows through a normal metal interface .",
    "they considered the case in which scattering takes place only at the interface .",
    "the landauer s approach is generalized to account for andreev reflection .",
    "an electron incident from the normal part reaches the interface and its probability to cross it or been reflected is calculated .",
    "electrodes are in equilibrium .",
    "thus the probability of each departing process and the occupation of the states is controlled by the fermi function .",
    "adding all possible processes current is calculated .    in that reference@xcite , it was shown that at large voltages the iv curves corresponding to a ns interface are linear with a slope equal to the normal state conductance .",
    "however they are displaced with respect to the normal state iv curve by an amount called excess current .",
    "al low voltages @xmath8 the shape of the iv curve is strongly dependent on the transmission of the interface . at large values of the transmission ,",
    "the current at low voltages is finite @xcite .",

    "probabilities and not quantum mechanical amplitudes are considered .",
    "the interference between scattering processes is neglected . with this model",
    ", it was possible to explain qualitatively the appearance of subharmonic gap structure in the iv characteristics of superconducting weak links .",
    "the computation of iv curves in superconducting constrictions was analyzed by arnold @xcite , within the formalism of green s functions . in the last years",
    ", several authors have improved @xcite these calculations , have calculated the fully coherent quantum mechanical i - v curves using different approaches @xcite and have generalized the calculations to the case in which transport takes place by resonant tunneling @xcite .    in this paper",

    "the current through a snins with finite length normal regions , is analyzed .",
    "they find that in these systems the subgap current is enhanced in comparison to that of superconducting constrictions .",
    "the effect is most pronounced in low transparency junctions .",
    "we will consider two cases : in section ii the case in which quantum - coherence is maintained between the barriers @xcite is analyzed .",
    "the details of the calculation are given in appendix a. in section iii we study the case in which both barriers are added in series , without considering quantum interference between the scattering processes at both barriers .",
