    "decays of @xmath1 mesons into @xmath20 and @xmath21 final states offer valuable information about strong interactions , weak interactions and possible new - physics ( np ) effects . in a series of recent papers @xcite",
    ", we developed a strategy to address these aspects in a systematic manner .",
    "it uses the following working hypotheses :    * @xmath13 flavour symmetry of strong interactions ( but taking factorizable @xmath13-breaking corrections into account ) ; * neglect of penguin annihilation and exchange topologies .",
    "we may gain confidence in these assumptions through internal consistency checks , which worked well within the experimental uncertainties for our previous numerical analyses .",
    "since the @xmath1 factories reported updated results for several of the input quantities , we would like to explore the implications for the picture emerging from our strategy . for a detailed overview of the current experimental status of the @xmath0 observables ,",
    "we refer the reader to the most recent compilation of the heavy flavour averaging group ( hfag ) @xcite",
    ". we will give the updated numerical values for the quantities entering our strategy below .    a somewhat surprising new development of this summer",
    "is a new world average for @xmath22 , which went down by about 1@xmath23 thanks to an update by the belle collaboration @xcite , and is now given as follows : @xmath24 the corresponding straight line in the @xmath25@xmath26 plane of the generalized wolfenstein parameters @xcite is now on the lower side of the allowed region for the apex of the unitarity triangle ( ut ) of the cabibbo  kobayashi ",
    "maskawa ( ckm ) matrix that follows from the usual  indirect \" fits @xcite . in view of this result",
    ", we assume that this potential discrepancy is due to np in @xmath5@xmath6 mixing , and perform an analysis of the ut in section  [ sec : gam - ut ] . to this end",
    ", we use the data for the decays @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which allow us to determine the  true \" ut angle @xmath29 @xcite , serving as an input for our subsequent analysis . complementing this information with the measurement of @xmath4 through semi - leptonic @xmath1 decays",
    ", we can construct the so - called reference unitarity triangle @xcite , and are in a position to convert the possibly emerging discrepancy for the ut into a cp - violating np physics phase in @xmath5@xmath6 mixing .",
    "moreover , we may extract the  true \" values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where the latter serves as an input for our analysis of rare decays .    in section  [ sec : bpipi ]",
    ", we then extract the hadronic parameters characterizing the @xmath32 system with the help of the @xmath33 isospin symmetry of strong interactions , and predict the cp - violating observables of the @xmath34 channel .",
    "the results of this section are essentially theoretically clean , and serve as a testing ground for the calculation of the dynamics of the @xmath32 decays directly from qcd - related approaches , such as `` qcd factorization '' ( qcdf ) @xcite , the perturbative qcd approach ( pqcd ) @xcite ,  soft collinear effective theory \" ( scet ) @xcite , or qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 system and the status of the  @xmath7 puzzle \" are then the subject of section  [ sec : bpik ] .",
    "we find that our standard - model ( sm ) predictions for those decays that are only marginally affected by electroweak ( ew ) penguins are in accordance with the experimental picture , whereas this is not the case for the observables with prominent contributions from these topologies , in particular for the ratio @xmath8 of the cp - averaged rates of the neutral @xmath7 modes .",
    "we show that this puzzle can still be resolved through np effects in the ew penguin sector with a large cp - violating new phase @xmath35 .",
    "we have also a closer look at another hot topic  the mixing - induced cp asymmetry of the @xmath36 channel  and point out that this quantity depends strongly on the sign of the np phase @xmath35 . in particular , this asymmetry , which is found experimentally to be significantly smaller than the sm expectation , can be brought closer to the data by reversing the sign of @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , we investigate whether significant non - factorizable @xmath13-breaking effects could have large impact on our analysis .",
    "interestingly , we find that this is not the case , and note that such effects are also not indicted by the internal consistency checks of our working assumptions .    in section  [ sec : rare - bk - scenarios ] , we explore the interplay of the np in the ew penguin contributions to the @xmath7 system with rare @xmath1 and @xmath15 decays . to this end",
    ", we apply the popular scenario that np enters the ew penguins through @xmath14-penguin topologies @xcite . in view of new experimental results",
    ", we speculate on possible future scenarios . as in our previous analysis",
    ", we find that @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are sensitive probes for these scenarios .",
    "this is also the case for the mixing - induced @xmath36 cp asymmetry discussed in section  [ sec : bpik ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "let us in view of the new result for @xmath22 first have a closer look at the ut .",
    "the starting point of this analysis is the assumption that the possible discrepancy between ( [ s2b - exp ] ) and the ckm fits is due to cp - violating np contributions to @xmath5@xmath6 mixing ( although it is of course too early to say something definite on this issue at the moment ) @xcite .",
    "for other recent analyses in this context , see @xcite .",
    "we may then extract the general @xmath5@xmath6 mixing phase @xmath40 where @xmath41 could originate from physics beyond the sm , from the numerical value in ( [ s2b - exp ] ) , yielding @xmath42 .",
    "here we have discarded a possible second solution around @xmath43 @xcite , which is disfavoured by recent @xmath1-factory data @xcite .",
    "the phase ( [ phid - def ] ) enters the mixing - induced cp asymmetry of the @xmath44 channel , which arises in the following time - dependent rate asymmetry : @xmath45 in the sm , these observables can be written as ( for the explicit expressions , see @xcite ) @xmath46 where we have also given the most recent experimental numbers , and @xmath47 is a cp - conserving hadronic parameter , which measures  sloppily speaking  the ratio of the @xmath48 penguin to tree contributions .",
    "let us now use the additional information which is provided by the @xmath49 decays .",
    "the assumptions listed at the beginning of section  [ sec : intro ] allow us then to derive @xmath50}_{\\mbox{$7.5\\pm 0.7 $ } } = \\underbrace{-\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\left[\\frac{{\\cal a}_{\\rm cp}^{\\rm dir}(b_d\\to\\pi^\\mp   k^\\pm)}{{\\cal a}_{\\rm cp}^{\\rm dir}(b_d\\to\\pi^+\\pi^- ) } \\right]}_{\\mbox{$6.7\\pm 2.0 $ } } \\equiv h_{{\\cal a}_{\\rm cp}^{\\rm dir}},\\ ] ] where @xmath51 , and the ratio @xmath52 of the kaon and pion decay constants takes factorizable @xmath13-breaking corrections into account . in ( [ h - rel ] ) , we have indicated the numerical values following from the current data .",
    "consequently , within the experimental uncertainties , this relation is also well satisfied by the new data , which gives us further confidence in our working assumptions .",
    "the quantities @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which are fixed through the branching ratios and direct cp asymmetries , respectively , can be written as follows : @xmath55 if we complement this expression with ( [ cp - bpipi - dir - gen ] ) and ( [ cp - bpipi - mix - gen ] ) , we have sufficient information to determine @xmath29 , as well as @xmath56 @xcite . following these lines yields",
    "@xmath57 @xmath58 consequently , @xmath53 and @xmath54 give results that are in good agreement with one another . as we discussed in @xcite , the solutions around @xmath59",
    "can be excluded through an analysis of the whole @xmath0 system , which is also the case for the most recent data . in the following analysis , we will use @xmath60 corresponding to @xmath54 , as this is theoretically cleaner than the avenue offered by @xmath53 .",
    "as we will see in subsection  [ ssec : su3break ] , even large non - factorizable @xmath13-breaking corrections have a remarkably small impact on the numerical result in ( [ gamma - det ] ) .",
    "the value for @xmath29 in ( [ gamma - det ] ) is somewhat larger than in @xcite , a significant part of the numerical shift can be explained by the new value for @xmath22 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : beta - gamma ] .    before having a closer look at the whole set of hadronic parameters characterizing the @xmath32 system ,",
    "let us first explore the implications of ( [ gamma - det ] ) for the apex of the ut in the @xmath25@xmath26 plane .",
    "the interesting feature of this value of @xmath29 following from the cp asymmetries of the @xmath48 , @xmath49 system is that it does not receive  in our scenario of np  any significant np contributions .",
    "consequently , it is the  true \" angle @xmath29 of the ut . in order to complete the determination of the `` true '' ut",
    ", i.e.  of the so - called reference ut @xcite , we use the ratio @xmath4 extracted from semi - leptonic tree - level @xmath1 decays .",
    "although its values extracted from exclusive and inclusive decays are markedly different from each other , we use the following average @xcite : @xmath61 in the second column of table  [ tab : rut ] , we list the values of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and  @xmath62 \" for this value of @xmath4 and @xmath29 in ( [ gamma - det ] ) . for completeness , we also give the values of the lengths of the ut sides @xmath63 and @xmath64 and of the angle @xmath30 .",
    "we observe that the value of @xmath62 that we obtain this way is significantly higher than the one in ( [ s2b - exp ] ) .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath65 .    in our scenario",
    ", this difference is attributed to a non - vanishing value of the np phase @xmath41 in ( [ phid - def ] ) , where @xmath31 corresponds to @xmath62 . as seen in table  [ tab : rut ] , our value of @xmath41 is compatible with the one found in @xcite , but our value of @xmath29 obtained here in a different manner is significantly higher .",
    "an even larger value of @xmath29 following from @xmath66 , in the ballpark of @xmath67 , has been reported from an analysis using scet @xcite . in table",
    "[ tab : rut ] , we also show the results for the reference unitarity triangle ( rut ) obtained in @xcite , where only cp violation in @xmath68 and @xmath4 in ( [ vub ] ) have been used as input .",
    "the agreement between our analysis and the one in @xcite is almost too good . in obtaining the values in the column `` utfit rut '' we have used @xmath25 and @xmath26 from @xcite . in the last two columns in table [ tab : rut ]",
    "we collect the results from @xcite within the sm and for the universal unitarity triangle ( uut ) in models with minimal flavour violation @xcite , where ( [ s2b - exp ] ) , @xmath4 and @xmath69 serve as inputs .",
    "as already stated above , the values of @xmath29 are in both cases significantly smaller , while the values of @xmath30 are significantly larger than in the case of the rut .",
    "the visibly increased value of @xmath64 relatively to the standard ut fits found by us in the case of the rut would require a small _ negative _ np contribution to the @xmath5@xmath6 mass difference @xmath70 and/or a slightly increased value of the non - perturbative parameter @xmath71 relevant for the ratio @xmath69 .",
    "we look forward to improved data on the @xmath66 , @xmath72 system , @xmath4 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 in order to see whether the difference between the large value of @xmath29 found here and the one resulting from the uut and full ut fits could be interpreted as a clear signal of np .     as determined in our strategy as a function of @xmath75 with all other experimental input parameters kept at their central values .",
    "the lines correspond to the values in ( [ s2b - exp ] ) and ( [ gamma - det]).[fig : beta - gamma],width=302 ]    .parameters of the reference ut ( rut ) determined through @xmath4 in ( [ vub ] ) and the cp asymmetries of the @xmath48 , @xmath49 system , yielding the value of @xmath29 in ( [ gamma - det ] ) , compared with the results of @xcite .",
    "we show also the results of the full ut fit and of the universal unitarity triangle obtained in @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "an attractive feature of the approach in @xcite is a direct connection between non - leptonic @xmath1 decays and rare @xmath1 and @xmath15 decays @xcite . assuming that the dominant np contributions enter through the @xmath14-penguin function @xmath76 , and using the renormalization - group evolution from scales @xmath77 to scales @xmath78",
    ", we can directly investigate the impact of the modified ew penguin contributions in the @xmath7 modes on rare @xmath1 and @xmath15 decays .",
    "proceeding in this manner we find that the value of @xmath79 in ( [ q - phi ] ) , which is preferred by the @xmath7 observables @xmath80 , requires the one - loop short - distance functions @xmath81 and @xmath82 to be at least as high as @xmath83 and @xmath84 in the sm .",
    "the values in ( [ xy1 ] ) appear to violate the @xmath85 probability upper bounds @xmath86 obtained recently in the context of minimal flavour violation ( mfv ) @xcite . while our scenario of np having new complex phases goes beyond mfv , the inspection of the known formulae for @xmath87 shows that the upper bound on @xmath82 in ( [ xy2 ] ) is difficult to avoid",
    "if the only np contribution resides in the ew penguins and the operator basis is the same as in the sm . for our analysis below",
    "we will , therefore , use an only slightly more generous bound and impose @xmath88 .",
    "taking then those values of @xmath79 from ( [ q - phi ] ) that also satisfy @xmath89 leaves us with @xmath90 note that this corresponds to a modest _ suppression _ of the magnitude of the ew penguin parameter relative to its new sm value of 0.58 .",
    "another possible solution to the clash between ( [ xy1 ] ) and ( [ xy2 ] ) would be the introduction of new complex phases in the photon magnetic penguin contribution that has no impact on the @xmath91 decays but can influence @xmath87 .",
    "this could weaken the tension between ( [ xy1 ] ) and ( [ xy2 ] ) subject to the bounds on the cp asymmetry in the @xmath92 decay , where the photon magnetic penguin plays an important rle @xcite .",
    "another avenue one could explore would be the introduction of new operators in @xmath87 that would invalidate the bounds in ( [ xy2 ] ) .",
    "for instance , new operators originating in higgs penguins in the mssm with a large @xmath93 could help here .",
    "the impact of these new operators on @xmath87 turns out to be moderate when the constraints on their wilson coefficients from @xmath94 are taken into account @xcite .",
    "still their presence can definitely weaken the bounds in ( [ xy2 ] ) , so that the values in ( [ xy1 ] ) are compatible with rare decay constraints in such a more complicated np scenario .    in spite of these possibilities",
    ", we will not explore them in the present paper because the predictive power of this more general np scenario is significantly smaller than of our scenario , unless a specific model is considered .",
    "instead we will investigate how various modifications of @xmath79 , which allow us to satisfy the bounds in ( [ xy2 ] ) , influence our results for the observables of the @xmath91 system presented in section [ sec : bpik ] , and the predictions for rare decays discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "for this purpose , we have introduced three scenarios that represent possible future measurements of @xmath8 and @xmath95 :    * scenario a : @xmath96 , @xmath97 , which is compatible with the present @xmath72 data and the rare decay bounds ( see ( [ q - phi - rd ] ) ) .",
    "* scenario b : we assume that @xmath8 goes up , and take @xmath98 @xmath99 , which leads to @xmath100 , @xmath101 and some interesting effects in rare decays , as we shall see below .",
    "this would , for example , occur if radiative corrections to the @xmath102 branching ratio enhance @xmath8 @xcite , though this alone would probably account for only about @xmath103 .",
    "* scenario c : assume that both @xmath8 and @xmath95 move towards 1 ; taking @xmath104 leads to @xmath105 , @xmath106 .",
    "the _ positive _ sign of the phase in this scenario distinguishes it strongly from both others .",
    "the result of this exercise is contained in tables [ scentab1 ] and [ scentab2 ] : in table [ scentab1 ] , we show the values of a number of observables of the @xmath7 system in the three scenarios , while in table  [ scentab2 ] , we show the corresponding values of the most interesting branching ratios for rare @xmath15 and @xmath1 decays . to this end",
    ", we have used for the angle @xmath31 the value of @xmath62 in table  [ tab : rut ] .",
    "we observe that , in particular , the interplay of the @xmath107 modes is a very good and clean indication of which kind of np scenario to look for . due to the interference of charm and top contributions in @xmath108 , it is also the decay that can most naturally be suppressed ( though this is in contrast to the present experimental value ) . on the other hand , @xmath109 is always enhanced due to the large values of @xmath35 and the absence of the charm contribution .",
    "concerning the observables of the @xmath72 system , @xmath110 offers a particularly interesting probe .",
    "this cp asymmetry comes out very large in scenarios a and b , where the np phase is negative . on the other hand , the positive sign in scenario c brings this value closer to the data , in accordance with the features pointed out in subsection  [ ssec : bpik - cp ] .",
    "similarly the experimental value of @xmath111 favours a positive value of @xmath35 .",

    "our sm results differ slightly from the standard values because we use the ckm input from the first column in table  [ tab : rut ] .",
    "larger values of @xmath64 and @xmath26 than found in @xcite result in higher values of @xmath171 and @xmath109 , respectively , than found in @xcite and @xcite . the great sensitivity of the rare decay branching ratios to the parameters @xmath79 demonstrates clearly the impressive power of rare @xmath15 and @xmath1 decays to search for np effects in the ew penguin sector .",
    "in this paper , we have reconsidered our analysis of @xmath0 and rare @xmath1 and @xmath15 decays in view of the new @xmath1-factory data for @xmath172 and the two - body modes as well as more stringent bounds on rare decays .",
    "the main new messages from our analysis are as follows :    * the @xmath44 and @xmath49 modes , which are marginally affected by ew penguins , allow us to determine @xmath3 . complementing this value with @xmath4",
    ", we can determine the true unitarity triangle , allowing us to search for np contributions to @xmath5@xmath6 mixing ; we find a np phase @xmath173 .",
    "* the @xmath7 puzzle , which is in particular reflected by the low experimental value of the ratio @xmath8 of the neutral @xmath7 branching ratios , persists",
    ". it still points to np in the ew penguin sector , and favours a large np phase @xmath174 , although now also a value around @xmath175 can bring us rather close to the current experimental ranges of @xmath80 .",
    "* @xmath10 would allow us to accommodate also the pattern of @xmath176 , which may be indicated by the @xmath1-factory data and received recently a lot of attention , although the measurements suffer still from large uncertainties .",
    "a similar comment applies to the difference @xmath129 in ( [ deltaa ] ) of the direct cp asymmetries of the @xmath49 and @xmath12 modes , which could be increased for @xmath10 .",
    "however , the latter cp asymmetry suffers from large uncertainties in our approach and does therefore not ( yet ) allow a stringent test . *",
    "the internal consistency checks of the working assumptions of our strategy are satisfied at the level of @xmath177 , and can be improved through better data .",
    "we studied the sensitivity of our numerical predictions of the @xmath7 observables on non - factorizable @xmath13-breaking effects of this order of magnitude , and found that the impact is surprisingly small .",
    "consequently , it is in fact very exciting to speculate on np effects in the ew penguin contributions to the @xmath7 decays .",
    "* in view of the fact that the parameters @xmath79 needed for the explanation of the low value of @xmath8 appear to imply rare decay branching ratios that violate the experimental bound from @xmath87 , we have explored various scenarios for @xmath79 that allow us to satisfy the rare decay constraints , but still give interesting results for both the @xmath91 decays and the rare @xmath15 and @xmath1 decays .",
    "needless to say , our analysis of the @xmath32 modes and the determination of the angle @xmath29 described above are not affected by these modifications . on the other hand",
    ", we find again that reversing the sign of the np phase @xmath35 brings the mixing - induced asymmetry of @xmath178 closer to the data .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that the simultaneous study of non - leptonic @xmath1-decay branching ratios , the corresponding direct and mixing - induced cp asymmetries and rare @xmath15 and @xmath1 decays within a consistent phenomenological framework developed in @xcite , can with improved data shed light on new physics and the structure of qcd dynamics in non - leptonic @xmath1 decays .    *",

    "<S> we analyse the @xmath0 modes in the light of the most recent @xmath1-factory data , and obtain the following new results : ( i ) the @xmath2 modes prefer @xmath3 , which  together with @xmath4  allows us to determine the `` true '' unitarity triangle and to search for cp - violating new - physics contributions to @xmath5@xmath6 mixing ; ( ii ) the @xmath7 puzzle reflected in particular by the low experimental value of the ratio @xmath8 of the neutral @xmath7 rates persists and still favours new physics in the electroweak penguin sector with a new cp - violating phase @xmath9 , although now also @xmath10 can bring us rather close to the data ; ( iii ) the mixing - induced @xmath11 cp asymmetry is a sensitive probe of the sign of this phase , and would currently favour @xmath10 , as well as the direct cp asymmetry of @xmath12 , which suffers , however , from large hadronic uncertainties ; ( iv ) we investigate the sensitivity of our @xmath7 analysis to large non - factorizable @xmath13-breaking effects and find that their impact is surprisingly small so that it is indeed exciting to speculate on new physics ; ( v ) assuming that new physics enters through @xmath14 penguins , we study the interplay between @xmath7 and rare @xmath1 , @xmath15 decays and point out that the most recent @xmath1-factory constraints for the latter have interesting implications , bringing us to a few scenarios for the future evolution of the data , where also the mixing - induced cp violation in @xmath11 plays a prominent rle .    </S>",
