    "the initial idea of signature change is due to hartle , hawking and sakharov @xcite which makes it possible to have a spacetime with euclidean and lorentzian regions in quantum gravity .",
    "it has been shown that the signature change may happen even in classical general relativity @xcite .",
    "there are two different approaches to this problem : continuous and discontinuous signature changes . in the continuous approach , in going through euclidean region to lorentzian one the signature of metric changes continuously .",
    "hence the metric becomes degenerate at the border of these regions .",
    "but in the discontinuous approach the metric is nondegenerate everywhere and discontinuous at the border of euclidean and lorentzian regions . in quest for effect of signature change in physical problems , mostly its effect on the propagation of massless boson",
    "has been rather deeply studied @xcite .",
    "dray and @xmath1 have shown that the phenomena of particle production can happen for propagation of scalar particle in spacetime with heteric signature .",
    "they have also obtained a rule for propagation of massless scalar field on a two dimensional space - time with signature change @xcite .",
    "the effect of signature change on the propagation of plane waves in going from lorentzian to kleinian region has been studied by alty @xcite .",
    "they have shown that this kind of signature change leads to unlimited energy extraction from kleinian region .",
    "there are of course rather a bit of works about the subject of signature change , which we do not follow them here . in this paper",
    "we follow the idea similar to kleinian type signature change @xcite in which it is a spacelike coordinate whose associated metric component changes sign discontinuously .",
    "we study the effect of such signature change over @xmath2 manifold on the free massless scalar field ( boson field ) , where @xmath3 represents timelike coordinate @xmath4 and the change of signature is induced from the change of sign in the metric component associated to the spacelike coordinate @xmath5 on the circle @xmath6 .",
    "the model is similar to that of dray and et al @xcite with the a difference that the role of space and time are changed .",
    "an idea about the topology change of the manifold @xmath2 over the spacelike hypersurface ( circle ) @xcite has been one of our motivations in studying the effects that such a signature change produces .",
    "the standard investigation of ordinary free massless scalar field on the manifold @xmath2 with a pure lorentzian signature gives rise to discrete energy spectrum of integer values and an infinite number of conserved charges called `` virasoro generators '' @xcite .",
    "these generators form a diffeomorphism algebra called `` virasoro algebra '' which gets a central term after quantization @xcite .",
    "introducing a region of euclidean type ( et ) signature , denoted by an angle @xmath0 as a long strip - shaped region of the cylinder @xmath2 enclosed by a lorentzian region , affects these standard results such that the energy spectrum and diffeomorphism algebra are modified ; specially the corresponding central term is a complicate function of energy and the angle @xmath0 .",
    "the modifications of spectrum and diffeomorphism algebra tends to disappear at higher values of energy @xmath7 but the central term does not approach to the standard central term at higher energies .",
    "thus it appears to be worth investigating this model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section @xmath8 , using the notation of reference @xcite , the signature change over @xmath6 has been throughoutly studied , where by requiring the continuity of currents accross the border of ( et ) and lorentzian regions we reach a junction condition . in section @xmath9 , the equation of motion for massless scalar",
    "boson has been solved in both regions . then imposing the appropriate junction conditions ,",
    "a quantization condition is imposed on the values of spectrum , @xmath7 , and real distributional solutions have been constructed .",
    "the section is ended by investigating their completeness and orthogonality . in section @xmath10 , using the poisson bracket of real scalar field with its conjugate momentum in both regions , the poisson bracket of normal modes @xmath11 has been obtained . in section @xmath12 , using the conservation of energy - momentum tensor distributions on both sides of the border of signature change in light cone coordinates , infinite number of conserved quantities @xmath13 have been obtained . in section @xmath14 , the diffeomorphism algebra of @xmath13 is constructed . in section @xmath15 , we expand @xmath13 in normal modes . finally in section @xmath16 , we quantize this model by dirac canonical quantizition method and show that the diffeomorphism algebra gets a central term which has been calculated for higher energies .",
    "the paper ends with a conclusion and an appendix explaining the derivation of structure constants of the algebra .",
    "in this section we use the symbols of ref.@xcite . we take the lagrangian of free massless scalar field @xmath17 with signature change in two dimensions as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the exterior derivative and @xmath20 is the hodge star given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 takes the values @xmath23 according to the orientation of the coordinates @xmath4 and @xmath5 in both regions @xmath24 of different signatures .",
    "morever we assume that the free massless scalar field propagates on a 2-dimensional manifold @xmath2 ( the circle @xmath6 represents `` space '' and the real line represents `` time '' ) with the following metric @xmath25 where @xmath4 is timelike coordinate and @xmath5 is a kind of periodic spacelike coordinate with period @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is a periodic function of @xmath5 , which takes + 1 for lorentzian region and -1 for ( et ) one .",
    "let us introduce an angle @xmath0 as a segment of the coordinate @xmath5 for which @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 the situation is shown in fig.1 in which the shaded region has ( et ) metric and a lorentzian metric is governed elsewhere .",
    "+ obviously for every killing vector @xmath29 , we have a conserved current as @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the contraction with @xmath29 .",
    "now , using the definition of hodge star in ( 2 ) , the currents @xmath32 can be written as @xmath33{\\sqrt{\\mid g \\mid } } d\\sigma - 2\\epsilon^\\pm \\frac{{\\partial_\\tau}\\phi{\\partial_\\sigma}\\phi}{\\sqrt{\\mid g \\mid } } sgn(g ) d\\tau\\ ] ] where @xmath34 denotes the definition ( 4 ) . in order the closed one - form @xmath35 to be defined consistently on the manifold @xmath36 , the pullbacks of @xmath32 to each hypersurface of signature change @xmath37 , @xmath38 must agree , using of stokes theorem @xcite .",
    "the agreement of pullbacks @xmath39 at each hypersurface @xmath37 , @xmath38 together with the assumption of continuity of @xmath17 across these hypersurfaces leads to the following `` junction condition '' at each @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xmath40 of course the junction condition ( 7 ) is similar to the one in @xcite with the difference that the roles of space and time are interchanged .",
    "the wave equations obtained from the variation of lagrangian ( 1 ) in ( et ) and lorentzian regions are @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are solutions in ( et ) and lorentzian regions respectively . obviously these equations can be solved exactly and their solutions are @xmath44 where the coefficients @xmath45 and @xmath46 , as well as the energy @xmath7 can be determined by using the junction condition ( 7 ) over the solutions ( 9 ) . assuming @xmath47 and @xmath48 for ( et ) and lorentzian regions respectively ; the continuity of @xmath49 and the junction condition ( 7 ) are written as @xmath50 here we have used the fact that these conditions are satisfied at all times along the coordinate @xmath4 .",
    "now , these conditions have nontrivial solutions for coefficients @xmath45 and @xmath46 , only if @xmath7 satisfies the following `` quantization condition '' @xmath51 for a given root of the equation ( 11 ) , the coefficients @xmath52 and @xmath46 are @xmath53   exp\\:(2\\pi i \\omega ) d_\\omega = a_\\omega d_\\omega\\\\ \\\\ b_\\omega = \\frac{1+i}{2}[-((exp\\:(i\\omega(\\theta - 2\\pi ) ) -cosh \\omega \\theta)/(sinh \\omega \\theta ) ) + 1 ]   exp\\:(2\\pi i \\omega ) d_\\omega = b_\\omega d_\\omega\\\\ \\\\ c_\\omega = \\frac{-i ( exp\\ : ( i \\omega \\theta ) - exp\\:(2\\pi i\\omega ) cosh \\omega \\theta)}{exp\\:(-2\\pi i \\omega ) sinh \\omega \\theta } d_\\omega = c_\\omega d_\\omega\\\\ \\\\ d_\\omega = arbitrary \\end{array}\\ ] ] where , the arbitrariness of @xmath46 makes it possible to fix other coefficients @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the spectrum of this model , @xmath7 , is real and @xmath0-dependent .",
    "it differs from ordinary spectrum ( with pure lorentzian signature ) at low energies and , as is seen in fig.2 , at high energies it coincides with the roots of @xmath56 ; therefore it , s `` sum over energies '' approaches to `` sum over integers '' at higher energies .",
    "+ now , we come to the orthogonality of our solutions for different values of @xmath7 .",
    "let us consider two solutions @xmath57 and @xmath58 , corresponding to two different roots of equation ( 11 ) .",
    "obviously they satisfy the following equations in the ( et ) region @xmath59 @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are @xmath63 dependent separable solutions .",
    "multiplying the first equation by @xmath64 and the second one by @xmath65 , integrating them in ( et ) region from zero to @xmath0 and finally adding them up , we get @xmath66 note that we have ignored the @xmath4 integration , since it does not affect the result ( 14 ) . similarly , the solutions @xmath67 and @xmath68 satisfy the following equations in the lorentzian region @xmath69 @xmath70 by a similar procedure we will have @xmath71 for the lorentzian region . adding equations ( 14 ) and ( 16 ) , and then imposing the junction conditions ( 10 ) we get @xmath72 now ,",
    "if we introduce the distribution @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 are the heaviside distribution with support in @xmath24 , then we get the following orthogonality condition on the @xmath75 hypersurface @xmath76 where the factor @xmath77 is introduced for convenience and the symbol @xmath78 denotes the inner product of solutions . choosing @xmath79 and substituting @xmath45 given by equation ( 12 ) in ( 9 ) , we get @xmath80 exp(-i\\omega\\tau)\\\\ \\\\ \\phi^l_\\omega(\\sigma,\\tau)= [ ( c / b)_\\omega exp(-i\\omega\\sigma ) + ( 1/b)_\\omega exp(i\\omega\\sigma)]exp(-i\\omega\\tau ) \\end{array}\\ ] ] @xmath81\\\\ \\\\ \\phi^l_0 = \\:[(c / b)_0 + ( 1/b)_0 ] \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath82,@xmath83 and @xmath84 are given by @xmath85 @xmath82 is real while @xmath83 and @xmath84 satisfy the following relation @xmath86 where @xmath20 denotes the complex conjugation . if @xmath87 then we have @xmath88 now by using of ( 23 ) and the reality of @xmath82 we can define , a set of real `` distributional '' orthogonal functions on the @xmath89 hypersurface @xmath90 where @xmath91 ) , @xmath92 ) are symmetric under the interchange of @xmath93",
    ". then the orthogonality condition of the functions @xmath94 is given by @xmath95 they also form a set of complete functions over the hypersurface @xmath96",
    ". therefore we can expand any real function @xmath97 in terms of them @xmath98 where the coefficients of expansion @xmath99 and @xmath100 can be determined by using the orthogonality of @xmath94 and reality of @xmath97 .",
    "that is , we have @xmath101 with @xmath102 where eq ( 24 ) and the relation @xmath103 have been used .",
    "therefore the completeness of @xmath94 can be written as @xmath104 or @xmath105",
    "the general solution of this model can be given as a superposition of its special solutions which are consistent with the junction condition ( 10 ) , that is @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the zero mode , and @xmath11 is the normal mode ; such that the reality of @xmath108 imposes the following condition on @xmath109 @xmath110 the momentum conjugate of @xmath108 is given by @xmath111 or @xmath112 now the poisson bracket is given by @xmath113 by substituting the normal mode expansion of @xmath114 , @xmath115 and the expansion of @xmath116 ( 30 ) in ( 36 ) we obtain @xmath117 where @xmath118 .",
    "let us define @xmath119 as @xmath120 hence the relations ( 37 ) and ( 32 ) can be rewritten as @xmath121 @xmath122 respectively , where @xmath123",
    "energy - momentum tensors are conserved in both ( et ) and lorentzian regions , that is to say @xmath124 where by using of ( 6 ) and ( 25 ) we get the following expressions for the components of energy - momentum tensors associated to real scalar field @xmath108 @xmath125 & \\hspace{20 mm } t_{01}^e = 2\\:\\partial_\\tau\\phi^e\\:\\partial_\\sigma\\phi^e \\\\",

    "so we can get infinite number of conserved quantities . adding",
    "the equations ( 50 ) and ( 51 ) in both regions and writing the partial derivatives @xmath142 in terms of @xmath143 and @xmath144 , we get the following current conservations @xmath145 + \\partial_\\sigma[i(f^e(+ ) - f^e(-))t_{00}^e + ( f^e(- ) + f^e(+))t_{01}^e ] = 0\\ ] ] in ( et ) region , and @xmath146 + \\partial_\\sigma[(f^l(- ) - f^l(+))t_{00}^l - ( f^l(- ) + f^l(+))t_{01}^l ] = 0\\ ] ] in lorentzian region , respectively . as in section @xmath8 in order to have a conserved current across the hypersurface of signature change , @xmath37 , one finds @xmath147 where , because of similar condition at both hypersurfaces @xmath148 , only the junction condition at @xmath37 is considered .",
    "+ now , using the junction condition ( 10 ) imposed on the @xmath149 components in ( 43 ) , leads to the following junction condition over @xmath150,s @xmath151 it is quite easy to show that @xmath152 exp(- i \\omega{\\sigma^e_\\pm})/\\sqrt{4\\pi<\\phi_\\omega,\\phi_\\omega>}\\\\ \\\\ \\tilde{f}_\\omega^l(\\sigma^\\pm ) = [ ( c / b)_\\omega + ( 1/b)_{-\\omega}]exp(- i\\omega{\\sigma^l_\\pm})/\\sqrt{4\\pi<\\phi_\\omega,\\phi_\\omega > } \\end{array}\\ ] ] and",

    "now one can define the following quantities @xmath154 + \\theta^-[\\tilde{f}_\\omega^l(+ ) t_{++}^l + \\tilde{f}_{-\\omega}^l(- ) t_{--}^l]\\ } d\\sigma\\ ] ] as the required conserved quantities , that is @xmath155 one can also show that : @xmath156 where the hamiltonian is defined as : @xmath157",
    "it is important to note that the conserved quantities @xmath13 are closed under the poisson bracket algebra .",
    "considering the following poisson brackets @xmath158 where ( 48),(49),(43 ) and ( 36 ) has been used , and redefining @xmath159 the poisson bracket of @xmath160,s takes the following form after some manipulation @xmath161 it is easy to see that @xmath162 and @xmath163 satisfy the equations ( 13-a , b ) and also @xmath164 and @xmath165 satisfy the equations ( 15-a , b ) , therefore one can expand @xmath163 and @xmath165 in terms of @xmath166 and @xmath167 respectively ( 2,3-a ) .",
    "hence we can write @xmath168 in terms of @xmath169 ; or @xmath160,s are closed under poisson bracket @xmath170 where , the structure constants @xmath171 are real and given by ( see appendix a ) @xmath172}\\{\\int_0^{\\theta}\\!\\tilde{\\phi}_{\\omega''}^e(\\sigma)\\ : ( \\tilde{f}_\\omega^e(\\sigma)\\ : \\tilde{f}_{\\omega'}^e(\\sigma ) + \\tilde{f}_{-\\omega}^e(\\sigma)\\:\\tilde{f}_{-\\omega'}^e(\\sigma ) ) d\\sigma\\ ] ] @xmath173 for @xmath174 and : @xmath175 for @xmath176 , where @xmath177 are normalized similar to @xmath178 by dividing by @xmath179 and @xmath180,s are @xmath5 dependent terms in ( 56 ) .",
    "these structure constants have asymptotic forms ( 15,19-a ) for higher values of @xmath7 or @xmath181 .",
    "so , by redefinition of @xmath160 and @xmath182 as @xmath183 the poisson bracket ( 65 ) is rewritten as @xmath184 where the redefined real structure constants @xmath185 and @xmath186 have the following asymptotic forms , using of ( 15,19-a ) , for higher values of @xmath7 or @xmath181 @xmath187 which are the structure constants of `` virasoro '' algebra . in table.1 and table.2 a set of numerical structure constants",
    "are given for two generic values of @xmath0 , which confirm ( 70 ) .",
    "note that for smaller @xmath0 the coincidence of structure constants with asymptotic forms are more clear than that of larger @xmath0 .",
    "interpreatation of these asymptotic behaviours will be given in section @xmath15 .",
    "similar to the ordinary 2-dimensional massless boson model , we can expand @xmath13 in terms of normal modes @xmath119 .",
    "hence , using expansion of @xmath108 , given in ( 32 ) , we can expand energy momentum tensors as @xmath188 ^ 2 = 2\\:\\sum_{\\omega\\omega ' } \\tilde{f}_\\omega^e(+)\\:\\tilde{f}_{\\omega'}^e(+ ) \\:\\tilde{\\alpha}_\\omega\\:\\tilde{\\alpha}_{\\omega'}\\\\ \\\\",

    "therfore our model is almost similar to the ordinary boson model for higher modes .",
    "physically this is due to the fact that the signature change effect in this model is similar to the presentetion of an ( et ) wall in the lorentzian background @xcite ; so that these modifications are reminiscent of a tunneling effect related to the ( et ) region , in which the rate of tunneling increases for higher energies . notice that due to the existence of a sharp discontinuity in this model it is not expected to get the standard results , corresponding to a pure lorentzian signature , at the continuous limit of @xmath201 ; rather , it is seen from quantization condition ( 11 ) that for small values of @xmath0 the `` sum over energies '' corresponding to the spectrum @xmath7 tends to `` sum over integers '' corresponding to the ordinary spectrum of boson field , at higher levels of energies ( not necessarily higher values of energies ) compared to the spectrum corresponding to a large value of @xmath0 .",
    "this is because , as @xmath0 tends to smaller values , the cosine function in ( 11 ) oscillates more rapidly and the spectrum is more condensed .",

    "hence , first we define normal ordering for @xmath119 as @xmath206 so normal ordered @xmath13 is @xmath207\\ ] ] obviously the normal order operator leads to the appearence of a central term or anomaly in the diffeomorphism algebra , i.e eq ( 69 ) @xmath208 =   ( \\omega - \\omega^\\prime ) \\sum_{\\omega^{\\prime\\prime } } c_{\\omega\\omega^\\prime}^{\\omega^{\\prime\\prime}}\\:l_{\\omega^{\\prime\\prime } } + c(\\omega,\\omega')\\ ] ] where the central term @xmath209 is a function of @xmath7 and @xmath181 . here",
    "we calculate @xmath209 for higher values of @xmath7 and @xmath181 . using eq ( 73 ) and asymptotic behaviour of @xmath193 ( 70 ) for higher values of @xmath210 and @xmath211",
    ", @xmath13 takes the following form for @xmath212 @xmath213 @xmath214 here @xmath215 is large enough so that we can take the asymptotic form of @xmath193 ( 70 ) for @xmath210 and @xmath211 larger than @xmath215 . notice that @xmath215 is the root of ( 11 ) after which the roots approaches the roots of @xmath216 ; such that `` sum over energies '' approach to `` sum over integers '' .",

    "finally , after a rather lenghty calculation ( for simplicity we assume @xmath222 ) and using the asymptotic form of @xmath13 for higher values of @xmath7 , together with the relations ( 83 ) , ( 84 ) and ( 79 ) the diffeomorphism algebra given in ( 81 ) takes the following form for higher @xmath7 and @xmath181 @xmath208 =   ( \\omega - \\omega ' ) l_{\\omega+\\omega ' } + c(\\omega,\\omega')\\ ] ] with @xmath223 where @xmath224[2(l+k)a+\\omega]^2[|(2(l+k)a+\\omega+\\omega')(2(l+k)a)|]^{1/2}\\ ] ] and @xmath225 with @xmath226 and @xmath227 as integers .",
    "we have considered a two dimensional model in which space - time is a cylinder ( circle @xmath228 real number ) where the circle represents `` space '' and the real line represents `` time '' .",
    "a segment of the circle is fixed with an angle @xmath0 and it is assumed that , inside the corresponding infinitely long strip - shaped region of the cylinder , the metric is of euclidean type ( et ) signature . on one hand ,",
    "such situations are unrealistic : what happens , when an observer tries to enter the ( et ) region ? on the other hand , the size of ( et ) region might be very small ( planck scale ? ) , and quantum effects might kill ( macroscopic ) inconsistencies .",
    "nevertheless it is mathematically interesting to investigate which kinds of effects a signature changing metric of this type would produce .",
    "hence it is worth exploring this model . for the sake of definiteness one may put a simple field on this manifold .",
    "we have chosen a free massless scalar field and have obtained the result that the energy spectrum , diffeomorphism algebra and the central term are modified as compared to the standard case ( pure lorentzian signature ) . at least at formal level , these modifications are reminiscent of a tunneling effect related to the ( et ) region @xcite .",
    "the modifications of spectrum and diffeomorphism algebra tend to disappear for higher values of energies but not the central term .",
    "so it appears that the presentation of signature change affects drastically the ordinary boson model at quantum level .",
    "+ in order to obtain the structure constants @xmath229 given in ( 65 ) we note that the left hand side of ( 65 ) is time independent . therefore , the right hand side must also be time independent .",
