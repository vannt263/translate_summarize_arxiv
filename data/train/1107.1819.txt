    "thanks to their rich observational manifestations , young energetic pulsars are among the most attractive targets for the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observatories .",
    "these manifestations include thermal emission from the neutron star ( ns ) surface , non - thermal emission from the pulsar magnetosphere , and a pulsar - wind nebula ( pwn ) produced by the interaction of the pulsar wind with the ambient medium .",
    "the magnetospheric and thermal emission can differ in their relative strengths and exhibit distinct spectra and pulse profiles .",
    "the magnetospheric emission usually has power - law ( pl ) spectrum and is strongly pulsed .",
    "detailed studies of several bright young pulsars indicate a nonuniform ns surface temperature distribution with cool ( @xmath11 ev ) and hot ( @xmath12 kev ) thermal components , which are believed to be emitted from the bulk of the ns surface and polar caps , respectively ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "since the sample of young pulsars with high quality x - ray spectra is still very small , further observations of young pulsars must be carried out to learn about the early epoch of ns cooling and test magnetospheric emission models .",
    "in addition to x - ray emission from the ns surface and magnetosphere , a significant amounts of non - thermal emission is radiated from the pwn .",
    "pwne display various shapes and structures , including ( but not limited to ) jets and tori , or cometary shaped tails @xcite .",
    "observations with high angular resolution are particularly useful since they resolve the extended pwn emission , seen downstream of the termination shock , from the magnetospheric non - thermal emission . comparing properties of these two components , one can learn about the physical processes responsible for an efficient but yet unknown particle acceleration mechanism energizing pwne .    although more than @xmath1370 pwne have been observed with _",

    "pulsars of similar ages and spin - down luminosities can have pwne with quite different properties . as of now ,",
    "it is not clear whether these differences can be solely attributed to different properties of the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) or different intrinsic properties of pulsars also play an important role . a larger sample of well - resolved x - ray pwne associated with pulsars having different intrinsic properties and residing in different environments is needed to further advance our understanding of pulsar winds .",

    ", the contours from the mos1 + 2 pwn image match the _ chandra _ pwn image quite well ( see figure  [ fig4 ] ) . since the source is near the chip edge in the pn image ,",
    "only part of the extended emission can be seen , while the other part is out of the field of view ( see figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",

    "unfortunately , the northern part of the pwn emission can not be seen because the source is near the chip edge . ]    to choose an optimal pwn region in the _ xmm - newton _ mos and pn images , we simulated the psf using quicksim .",
    "the simulation shows that an @xmath74 circle around the position of the pulsar contains 88% encircled count fraction for the point source .",
    "excluding this circle from the pwn polygon region ( see figure 3 ) leaves 3,446 counts in mos1 + 2 , including @xmath75% background contribution .",
    "although some regions of the pwn are out of the pn small window field of view ( see figure  [ fig5 ] ) , we still collected 3,771 counts , including @xmath76% background contribution .",
    "given the lack of other promising counterparts and the location of j1357 within the hess  j1356 extent , it seems very plausible that the two should be related in some way .",
    "yet the nature of hess  j1356 has not been firmly established .",
    "the tev emission could be attributed to either the host snr or to the relic pwn of j1357 . to date , several well - known snrs have been detected in the tev band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the cases of resolved snrs",
    ", the tev emission was associated with the snr shell , and the sizes of the snrs in tev images were similar to those of the non - thermal radio shells indicating that both emission components are powered by particles accelerated in the forward shock .",
    "although no shell is seen in the radio images of hess  j1356 , the radio emission is mainly seen near the center of hess  j1356 ( see fig .  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "thus , in this case the tev emission does not appear to be associated with the nonthermal shell , and the shell itself is not seen in the radio .",
    "an alternative , more plausible , interpretation of the tev and radio emission could be a relic pwn .",
    "many extended tev sources neighbor young vela - like pulsars , sometimes offset up to @xmath77@xmath78 from the center of tev emission ( see kp10 for recent review ) .",
    "furthermore , recent x - ray observations of the vela pulsar region ( vela x ; mori et al .  2008 ) ,",
    "psr  j18261334 ( gaensler et al .  2003 ; pavlov et al .",
    "2008 ) and psr  j18091917 @xcite have provided convincing evidence that the tev sources are connected to the parent pulsars through faint asymmetric x - ray nebulae ( see table  [ tab4 ] ) . indeed , the _ chandra _ observations have demonstrated that in the above three examples the pwne consist of compact ( 0.10.8 pc ) bright cores and fainter asymmetric , more extended ( 28 pc ) components .",
    "the offsets and the asymmetries of the x - ray pwne could be created by the reverse snr shock that had propagated through the nonhomogeneous snr interior and reached one side of the pwn sooner than the other side @xcite .",
    "this scenario could also account for the similarly asymmetric , offset tev emission ( e.g. , de jager & djannati - ata 2009 ) .",
    "however , the physical origin of the tev emission still remains under debate .",
    "it can be produced via the inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of the relativistic pulsar - wind electrons on photons from the omnipresent cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , galactic ir background , and ir photons from local star - forming regions and warm dust clouds .",
    "alternatively , the tev photons can be produced as a result of @xmath79 decay , with @xmath80 being produced when the relativistic protons from the pulsar wind interact with the ambient matter ( e.g. , horns et al .",
    "2007 ) . in the case of hess",
    "j1356 , the offset is well within the range observed in other relic pwn candidates ( see kp10 ) .",
    "the ratio of the tev luminosity to the pulsar s spin - down power , @xmath81 , and the ratio of x - ray to @xmath31-ray ( 110 tev ) pwn luminosities , @xmath82 , are similar to those of other relic plerions .",
    "alternatively , the relic pwn could be left behind the fast moving pulsar if the latter is moving in the northeast direction ( see above ) . at a typical speed of 400 km",
    "s@xmath8 , the pulsar would move by @xmath83 in 10 kyrs , which is consistent with the offset between the pulsar and the center of hess  j1356 .",
    "so far , there have been no reports of vhe emission from pulsar tails .",
    "it would be interesting to establish the presence of the tev emission from an extended pulsar tail because this would help to break the degeneracy in interpreting the nature of the vhe emission from the crushed pwne , for which both leptonic ( inverse compton ) and hadronic ( @xmath84 decay ) tev emission mechanisms are currently being debated .",
    "if the @xmath84 decay is the dominant process in the crushed pwne , we would expect pulsar tails to be significantly fainter in the tev because high - speed pulsars move in low density media outside their host snrs . on the other hand , in the leptonic scenario , crushed",
    "plerions and pulsar tails should have comparable tev luminosities .",
    "regardless of the nature of the relic pwn and the mechanism responsible for the vhe emission , one can expect that the observed extended radio emission within hess  j1356 may also be produced by the pulsar wind if the electron sed extends to sufficiently low energies .",
    "better quality radio images , more complete multiwavelength spectrum , and robust multizone pulsar wind models are required to assess the origin of the radio emission .",

    "<S> we observed the young pulsar j13576429 with the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observatories . </S>",
    "<S> the pulsar spectrum fits well a combination of absorbed power - law model ( @xmath0 ) and blackbody model ( @xmath1 ev , @xmath2 km at the distance of 2.5 kpc ) . strong pulsations with pulsed fraction of @xmath3 , apparently associated with the thermal component , were detected in 0.31.1 kev . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , pulsed fraction at higher energies , 1.110 kev , appears to be smaller , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the small emitting area of the thermal component either corresponds to a hotter fraction of the neutron star ( ns ) surface or indicates inapplicability of the simplistic blackbody description . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray images also reveal a pulsar - wind nebula ( pwn ) with complex , asymmetric morphology comprised of a brighter , compact pwn surrounded by the fainter , much more extended pwn whose spectral slopes are @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the extended pwn with the observed flux of @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 @xmath9 is a factor of 10 more luminous then the compact pwn . </S>",
    "<S> the pulsar and its pwn are located close to the center of the extended tev source hess j1356645 , which strongly suggests that the vhe emission is powered by electrons injected by the pulsar long ago . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray to tev flux ratio , @xmath10 , is similar to those of other relic pwne . </S>",
    "<S> we found no other viable candidates to power the tev source . </S>",
    "<S> a region of diffuse radio emission , offset from the pulsar toward the center of the tev source , could be synchrotron emission from the same relic pwn rather than from the supernova remnant . </S>"
