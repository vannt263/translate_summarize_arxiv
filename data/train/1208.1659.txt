    "owing to their many favorable features such as the absence of defects and dynamic control of relevant parameters , optical lattices constitute a versatile tool for controlling the properties of atomic quantum fluids @xcite .",
    "they have proven to be an invaluable platform for studying quantum phase transitions such as from a superfluid to a mott - insulator ( sf - mi ) @xcite and simulating many - body systems @xcite .",
    "the high densities and low temperatures required for investigating these quantum effects are provided by bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite .",
    "while multi - component becs  and , especially , two - component ones @xcite  have attracted a great deal of interest since the early days of bec @xcite , the addition of the optical - lattice environment @xcite allows one to study interesting transport properties of cold atoms in the superfluid regime .",
    "one of them , which has so far not been given due attention , is the superfluid drag in two - component becs .",
    "such a non - dissipative drag effect was first investigated by andreev and bashkin @xcite in the context of @xmath0he-@xmath1he mixtures .",
    "a microscopic theory of the drag between two weakly interacting bose gases was developed in the continuum limit @xcite and generalized to the non galilean invariant case as realized in an optical lattice @xcite . for a system of strongly interacting bosons ,",
    "the superfluid drag was investigated by means of monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "drag effects have also been studied in different systems .",
    "for instance , in electronic mesoscopic systems coulomb drag has been studied both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we study the drag ( entrainment coupling @xcite ) between two weakly interacting bose gases in quasi two - dimensional optical lattices .",
    "we derive a formula for the superfluid - drag coefficient valid for an arbitrary lattice and evaluate it for different lattice geometries . in this manner",
    "we extend the results presented in ref .   where this has been done for the special case of the three - dimensional cubic lattice .",
    "this derivation proceeds by diagonalizing the hamiltonian using a bogoliubov approximation and subsequent expansion of the free energy in the superfluid velocities .",
    "the band dispersions and interaction parameters needed to evaluate the superfluid - drag coefficient are obtained numerically by means of a truncated plane - wave expansion of the optical lattice potentials . using this numerically exact approach , instead of the tight - binding approximation",
    ", we obtain results that are reliable even in the limit of shallow optical lattices where superfluidity is assured for both commensurate and incommensurate filling . as a result of the interplay between the interaction and kinetic energies , we find a non - monotonic dependence of the superfluid - drag coefficient on the optical lattice depth .",
    "in contrast to ref .  , where the mass ratio which maximizes the superfluid drag was found to be around unity for an arbitrary lattice depth , we find that the optimal mass ratio depends on the lattice depth .",
    "in addition to the two - dimensional square lattice , we investigate the drag in the particularly interesting three - beam lattices ( 3bl ) .",
    "these are two - dimensional optical lattices with non - separable potentials @xcite , created by three in - plane laser beams @xcite .",

    "although the magnitude of the superfluid drag varies strongly with the lattice geometry , the qualitative behavior as a function of the mass ratio and the lattice depth is the same : for fixed mass ratio , the drag increases upon raising @xmath96 from zero , reaches its maximum and then decreases .",
    "quantitatively , this behavior is strongly dependent on the mass ratio .",
    "the lattice - depth dependence of the drag can be ascribed to a competition between the interaction and kinetic energies . as @xmath96 increases ,",

    "this effect is strongly dependent on the particle masses involved .",
    "a similar behavior can be observed upon increasing @xmath99 for a fixed lattice depth . for a small mass ratio",
    "the drag increases , because it is linear in @xmath99 , before it starts to decay due to the decrease in kinetic energy .    comparing the 3bsl with the 4bsl",
    ", one notices that in the 4bsl the superfluid drag is much larger over a broader range of lattice depths .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the hopping amplitudes are smaller and the sf - mi transition sets in at much shallower lattices for the 3bls @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation as to why the drag is stronger in the 3bsl than in the 3btl can be given if one envisions the drag as being mediated by component @xmath100 particles , dressed by a cloud of component @xmath92 particles and vice versa . in this case",
    "one could argue that the higher coordination number of the 3btl leads to more events whereby one of the particles within the cloud splits off the dressed particle .",
    "in addition to the above findings , we stress that for a fixed mass ratio , the lattice depth @xmath45 which maximizes the drag seems to be independent of the particle densities @xmath101 . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath98 depends on the particle densities as shown in fig .",

    "itself varies with the mass ratio . comparing the density dependence at @xmath45 which maximizes the drag for the respective mass ratio",
    ", we find that it hardly changes at all .",
    "finally , we note that for two components with the same scattering length the drag always increases upon increasing the particle number ( data not shown ) . for two species with different scattering lengths on the other hand ,",
    "increasing the number of the more strongly interacting particles can actually lead to a decrease in the superfluid drag ( see fig .",

    "we have studied the drag between components of a two - species bec in optical lattices . to assure that our results are valid even for shallow optical lattices , we did not make use of the tight - binding approximation but used a numerically exact approach instead . consequently , we generalized the previously derived expression for the superfluid - drag coefficient to arbitrary lattice geometries . to clarify the dependence of the superfluid drag on the lattice geometry",
