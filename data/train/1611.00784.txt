    "there is a vast literature on models that attempt to explain the observed hierarchy of fermion masses by means of horizontal symmetries . in this paper , we revisit one such model , proposed by aranda , carone and lebed , based on the double tetrahedral group @xmath0  @xcite . prior to this work , it had been shown that supersymmetric grand unified theories with u(2 ) flavor symmetry predict simple forms for the yukawa matrices , ones that provide a successful description of charged fermion masses and the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix  @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite posed a simple question : what is the smallest discrete flavor group that predicts the same form for the yukawa textures ?",
    "the answer to this question was determined by the specific group theoretic properties of u(2 ) that were utilized in the most successful u(2 ) models  @xcite :    1 .",
    "u(2 ) models involved fields in @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 dimensional representations ( reps ) .",
    "matter fields of the three generations were embedded into @xmath4 dimensional reps ; the fact that the third generation fields were treated differently allowed the model to accommodate an order one ( _ i.e. _ , a flavor - group - invariant ) top quark yukawa coupling .",
    "the flavor - symmetry - breaking fields , called flavons , appeared in all three of these representations .",
    "2 .   in each yukawa matrix , the two - by - two block associated with the first two generations decomposed into an antisymmetric and symmetric part .",
    "these followed from the couplings of the @xmath1 and @xmath3-dimensional flavon fields , respectively , due to the group multiplication rule @xmath5 3 .",
    "the u(2 ) symmetry was broken to a u(1 ) subgroup that rotated all first generation fields by a phase .",
    "this u(1 ) symmetry was subsequently broken at a lower energy scale than that of the original u(2 ) symmetry .",
    "since yukawa couplings emerge as a ratio of a symmetry - breaking scale to a cut off , the sequential breaking of the flavor symmetry explains why the yukawa couplings associated with first generation were smaller than those of the heavier generations .",
    "the group @xmath0 is special in that it is the smallest discrete group that has @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3-dimensional representations , as well as the multiplication rule @xmath6 .",
    "we will briefly review the representations and multiplication rules for @xmath0 symmetry in sec .",
    "[ sec : textures ] . following ref  @xcite , the appropriate symmetry breaking sequence is achieved if the flavor group includes an abelian factor , so that @xmath7",
    ". then the breaking pattern of the u(2 ) model @xmath8 is mimicked by @xmath9 here we have indicated the scale of each symmetry breaking via the dimensionless parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which represent the ratio of a symmetry - breaking vacuum expectation value ( vev ) to the cut off of the effective theory .",
    "we refer to the cut off as the flavor scale , @xmath12 , henceforth . a useful way to understand the connection between eq .",
    "( [ eq : ubreak ] ) and ( [ eq : tpbreak ] ) is to consider the su(2)@xmath13u(1 ) subgroup of u(2 ) ; the @xmath0 factor is a subgroup of the su(2 ) factor while @xmath14 is a subgroup of the u(1 ) .",
    "the @xmath14 factor remaining after the first step in the symmetry - breaking chain in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tpbreak ] ) also transforms all first generation fields by a phase and will be specified later .",
    "the @xmath15 model defined in this way reproduces the successful yukawa textures of the u(2 ) models , but with a much smaller symmetry group .",
    "for other productive applications of @xmath0 symmetry in flavor model building , we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 models of refs .",
    "@xcite were constructed more than 16 years ago , when it was widely assumed that weak - scale supersymmetry was the likely solution to the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "the numerical study of the yukawa textures in these references assumed supersymmetric renormalization group equations to relate the predictions of the theory at the flavor scale @xmath12 to those at observable energies .",
    "superpartners were taken to have masses just above the electroweak scale , while @xmath12 was identified with the scale of supersymmetric grand unification , @xmath16  gev .",
    "the latter choice was motivated by the most elegant @xmath0 models , which were formulated in the context of an @xmath17 grand unified theory .",
    "some of the essential features of the yukawa textures followed from the combined restrictions of the flavor and grand unified symmetries .",
    "at the present moment , however , the status of weak - scale supersymmetry as a necessary ingredient in model building is far less certain .",
    "the latest data from the lhc has found no evidence for supersymmetry .",
    "of course , this may simply mean that the scale of the superpartner masses is slightly higher than what one might prefer from the perspective of naturalness ; this interpretation would have little effect on the results of refs .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the lhc may be hinting that there is no necessary connection between the weak scale and the scale of supersymmetry breaking . in this case",
    ", one might entertain the possibility that the supersymmetry breaking scale is associated with the only higher physical mass scale whose existence is well established : the planck scale .",
    "for example , it has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that the shallowness of the higgs potential may be explained by planck - scale supersymmetry breaking , assuming that supersymmetry is still relevant for a quantum gravitational completion .",
    "this latter assumption itself has been challenged in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it has been noted that there are consistent string theories that are fundamentally non - supersymmetric and whose low - energy limit could include the standard model . whether supersymmetry is broken at the planck scale , or not present at any scale , one might attempt to address the hierarchy between the weak scale and planck scale , for example , by anthropic selection , or by higgs field relaxation  @xcite , or by mechanisms not yet known .",
    "alternatively , one might pursue the idea that quantum gravitational physics does not contribute to scalar field quadratic divergences in the way that one expects naively from effective field theory arguments  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we remain completely agnostic on the issue of naturalness .",
    "we instead investigate a question that can be addressed in a more definitive and quantitative way : how well do the @xmath0 flavor models in refs .",
    "@xcite work if there is no supersymmetry below the planck scale ?",
    "we begin our study by assuming a standard form for the yukawa textures expected in models with @xmath15 symmetry and perform a global fit to the charged fermion masses and ckm elements assuming that the predictions at the flavor scale @xmath12 are related to those at the weak scale via non - supersymmetric renormalization group equations . in the absence of supersymmetry",
    ", we no longer have gauge coupling unification and therefore do not consider grand unified embeddings .",
    "the flavor scale is taken as a free parameter that may vary anywhere from the tev scale to the planck scale . by study of the goodness of these fits",
    ", we consider whether there is any preference for a higher or lower flavor scale within the specified range .",
    "if one were to find acceptable results for values of @xmath12 near the planck scale , one might conclude that the model is consistent with a minimal scenario in which there are no other energy scales of physical relevance other than the weak and the planck scale . on the other hand ,",
    "if one were to find acceptable results for @xmath12 closer to the lower bounds from flavor - changing - neutral - current processes , then one might obtain interesting predictions for observable indirect effects of heavy particles associated with the flavor sector .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the flavor models of interest and present a parameterization of the yukawa matrix textures that typically arise in these models at the flavor scale @xmath12 . in sec .",

    "sec : models ] , we address model building issues : supersymmetric models have two higgs doublets ( in order to cancel anomalies ) and have a superpotential that is constrained by holomorphicity ; these requirements are absent in the non - supersymmetric case .",
    "hence , in this section we show how the textures assumed in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] may arise in non - supersymmetric @xmath0 models . in the final section ,",
    "we summarize our conclusions .",
    "the group @xmath0 is discussed at length in ref .  @xcite . here",
    "we summarize only the most basic properties relevant to the present discussion : the group has @xmath18 elements .",
    "this includes @xmath19 elements that correspond to the @xmath19 proper rotations that take a regular tetrahedron into coincidence with itself , with choices of euler angles that are less than @xmath20 .",
    "the remaining @xmath19 elements are the first set times an element called @xmath21 that corresponds to a @xmath20 rotation . as we indicated earlier , @xmath0 has @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3-dimensional representations , that we specify more precisely below . for odd - dimensional representations ,",
    "@xmath21 acts trivially and the action of the group @xmath0 is not distinguishable from that of the tetrahedral group @xmath22 . for the even - dimensional representations ,",
    "however , @xmath21 acts non - trivially ; this reflects the fact that @xmath0 is a subgroup of su(2 ) and that spinors flip sign under a rotation by @xmath20 .",
    "the complete list of @xmath0 representations is as follows : there is a trivial singlet , @xmath23 , two non - trivial singlets , @xmath24 , three doublets , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and one one triplet , @xmath27 .",
    "the different singlet and doublet representations are distinguished by how they transform under a @xmath14 subgroup , generated by the group element called @xmath28 in ref .",
    "this is indicated by the triality superscript ; when we multiply representations , trialities add under addition modulo three . keeping this in mind ,",
    "the rules for multiplying representations are then specified by @xmath29    as we indicated in the introduction , the models of interest are based on the flavor group @xmath7 , which includes a @xmath14 subgroup that rotates all first - generation matter fields by a phase .",
    "we now identify that subgroup . in the models of ref .",
    "@xcite , the first two generations are assigned to the @xmath25 representation , in which the element @xmath28 is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "however , the matter fields may also transform under the @xmath14 factor that commutes with @xmath0 .",
    "we represent charge assignments under this @xmath14 by an additional triality index @xmath32 , corresponding to the phase rotations @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the diagonal subgroup of the @xmath14 subgroup generated by @xmath28 and the @xmath14 factor that commutes with @xmath0 is the intermediate symmetry that we desire ; we call this subgroup @xmath36 .",
    "if we assign the first two generations to the rep @xmath37 , then the action of @xmath36 is through powers of the product @xmath38 which provides the desired first generation phase rotation .    assigning the three generations of matter fields to the @xmath39 reps @xmath40",
    "yields the following transformation properties of the yukawa matrices : @xmath41 & [ { { \\bf 2}}^{0 + } ] \\\\ [ { { \\bf 2}}^{0 + } ] & [ { { \\bf 1}}^{00}]\\end{pmatrix}.\\ ] ] the models of interest include a set of flavon fields , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which transform as @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "when the @xmath39 symmetry is broken to @xmath36 , the doublet and triplet flavons acquire the vevs @xmath48 where we use @xmath49 when we omit possible order one factors .",

    "( [ eq : z_3^dtrans ] ) .",
    "yukawa couplings involving first - generation fields are generated only after the @xmath36 symmetry is broken at a lower scale ; in analogy to the u(2 ) models of ref .",

    "this sequential breaking @xmath52 yields a yukawa texture for the up quarks , down quarks and leptons of the form @xmath53 where we ve suppressed @xmath54 operator coefficients .    the forms of the yukawa matrices obtained in eq .",
    "( [ eq : yukawasymbreaking ] ) are inadequate , given the known differences between the up- , down- and charged - lepton masses .",
    "the top quark yukawa coupling is of order one , while the all others are substantially smaller , suggesting an additional overall suppression factor is desirable in @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , the hierarchy of quark masses is more extreme in the up - quark sector than in the down ; for example , the quark mass ratios renormalized at the supersymmetric grand unified scale are given approximately by  @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the cabibbo angle .",
    "this suggest that an additional suppression in the @xmath33-@xmath59 block of @xmath60 is also desirable .",

    "we generally require these to be between @xmath66 and @xmath67 in magnitude ; the precise range is a matter of taste , but our choice is consistent with the assumptions of refs .",
