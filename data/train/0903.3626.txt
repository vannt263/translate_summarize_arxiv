    "solitary wave interactions are important phenomena in science and engineering @xcite .",
    "these interactions can be divided roughly into two types depending on the strength of the interactions .",
    "strong interactions , often called collisions , are the interactions of solitary waves at close distance .",
    "they would occur when two solitary waves are initially far apart but move toward each other at moderate or large speeds .",
    "weak interactions are the interactions of solitary waves at far distance through weak tail overlap .",
    "these interactions would occur if the two waves are initially well separated , and their relative velocities are small or zero .",
    "in integrable systems , collisions of solitary waves are elastic @xcite , and their weak interactions exhibit interesting but still simple behaviors @xcite . for certain integrable systems perturbed by higher - order corrections ,",
    "if they can be asymptotically transformed to integrable equations , then their solitary wave interactions would closely resemble those in integrable systems @xcite .",
    "if the systems are non - integrable , however , solitary wave interactions can be extremely complicated , and they can depend on initial conditions in a sensitive , fractal manner .",
    "this fractal - scattering phenomenon was first discovered for kink and antikink collisions in the @xmath0 model @xcite , later in several other physical systems as well @xcite .",
    "for these strong interactions , a resonant energy exchange mechanism between the collision and internal / radiation modes was found responsible for this fractal scattering . to analyze these fractal scatterings , approximate collective - coordinate ode models based on variational methods",
    "@xcite have been derived , and these odes are found to exhibit qualitatively similar fractal scatterings as in the pdes @xcite .",
    "goodman and haberman further studied these collective - coordinate ode models using dynamical systems methods @xcite . performing asymptotic analysis along separatrix ( homoclinic ) orbits , they derived separatrix maps which led to the prediction of @xmath1-bounce resonance windows .",
    "it is noted that the separatrix maps derived in @xcite contain parameters which depend on initial conditions .",
    "in addition , these maps differ from one pde system to another . on weak interactions , fractal scatterings",
    "have been found as well in a weakly discrete sine - gordon equation and a class of generalized nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equations @xcite .",
    "for these weak interactions , the mathematical analysis can be made more rigorous and quantitative .",
    "indeed , by extending the karpman - solovev perturbation method @xcite , zhu and yang derived a simple and asymptotically accurate ode model for weak interactions in the generalized nls equations with arbitrary nonlinearities @xcite .",
    "after various normalizations , this ode system contains only a single constant parameter which corresponds to different nonlinearities in the pdes .",
    "these odes are a two - degrees - of - freedom hamiltonian system with highly coupled potentials , and their forms are quite different from the collective - coordinate ode models derived and studied previously for strong interactions @xcite .",
    "zhu , haberman and yang further analyzed this ode model and derived a simple second - order map by using asymptotic methods near separatrix orbits @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of this map is that it does not contain any free parameters after various rescalings , thus it is universal for all weak interactions of solitary waves in the generalized nls equations with arbitrary nonlinearities . despite its simplicity , this map can capture all the fractal - scattering phenomena of the original pdes and the reduced odes very well both qualitatively and quantitatively @xcite .",
    "reduction of weak - interaction dynamics from the pdes into a simple and universal second - order map is the main contribution of @xcite . with the availability of this universal map",
    ", one may now expect a complete characterization and understanding of fractal scatterings in weak wave interactions .",
    "for instance , we now would like to know under what conditions fractal scatterings would occur or would not occur .",
    "for another instance , we now would like to know how these fractals change as nonlinearities of the pdes and initial conditions of the solitary waves vary .",
    "in addition , we now would like to understand how the zoomed - in structures of the fractal are related to the original structures , and how these geometric structures dictate the features of interaction dynamics .",
    "all these questions can be answered by a careful analysis of this universal map .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze this universal map in detail , which will provide a complete characterization of fractal scatterings in weak wave interactions in the pdes .",
    "first we will show that this map has a fractal structure of its own .",
    "we will delineate the map s fractal by tracking its singular curves .",
    "then we will connect the map s fractal to that of the pde , and thus reach a deep understanding of the pde s fractal as well as its solution dynamics .",
    "in addition , we will determine how the pde s fractal changes when the soliton parameters and the nonlinearity of the pde vary . a precise analytical criterion for the occurrence of fractal scatterings in the pdes",
    "will also be given explicitly .",
    "all our analytical results are confirmed by direct numerical simulations .",
    "these results significantly advance our understanding of fractal scatterings in weak interactions of solitary waves .",
    "first , we summarize previous relevant work which will form the basis for our later analysis .",
    "we consider weak interactions in the generalized nls equations @xmath2 these equations admit solitary waves of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a localized positive function , @xmath5 is the wave s center position , @xmath6 is the phase function , and @xmath7 is the propagation constant ( which determines the amplitude of the wave ) .",
    "this wave has four free parameters : velocity @xmath8 , amplitude parameter @xmath7 , initial position @xmath9 , and initial phase constant @xmath10 . in weak interactions ,",
    "two such solitary waves are initially well separated with small relative velocities and amplitude differences .",
    "then they would interfere with each other through tail overlapping .",
    "when time goes to infinity , they either separate from each other at constant velocities , or form a bound state .",
    "the exit velocity , defined as @xmath11 , depends on the initial conditions of the two waves . when the two waves form a bound state , we define @xmath12 . throughout this paper , we label the left and right waves by numbers 1 and 2 respectively .    in @xcite , we have shown that for a large class of nonlinearities @xmath13 , this weak interaction depends on the initial conditions in a sensitive , fractal manner . to analyze this fractal - scattering phenomenon ,",
    "an extended karpman - solovev perturbation method was utilized , and the following simple set of dynamical equations for soliton parameters were derived @xcite : @xmath14 here @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the distance and phase difference between the two waves , @xmath18 , @xmath19 are the initial propagation constants of the two waves , @xmath20 is the tail coefficient of the solitary wave with propagation constant @xmath7 , and @xmath21 is the power function of the wave .",
    "this ode system is universal for the pde ( [ eqgnls ] ) , and different nonlinearities",
    "@xmath13 only correspond to different constant parameter @xmath22 . if @xmath23 [ such as when eq .",
    "( [ eqgnls ] ) is the original nls equation ] , the odes ( [ eqdyfinal ] ) are integrable , and their solutions have explicit functional expressions @xcite",
    ". if @xmath24 , ( [ eqdyfinal ] ) is not integrable . in this case , when @xmath25 and under certain initial conditions , we have found that these odes exhibit fractal scattering structures which agree with those in the pdes ( [ eqgnls ] ) both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "but when @xmath26 , no fractal scatterings arise in these odes and their corresponding pdes under any initial conditions @xcite .",
    "in order to further understand these fractal scatterings , we have analyzed the ode system ( [ eqdyfinal ] ) extensively in @xcite for @xmath27 , using perturbation methods near separatrix orbits .",
    "these odes are a two - degree - of - freedom hamiltonian system with the conserved hamiltonian @xmath28 where @xmath29 is called the energy .",
    "we also define the momentum @xmath30 of eqs .",
    "( [ eqdyfinal ] ) as @xmath31 both @xmath32 and @xmath30 are conserved when @xmath23 , but vary over time when @xmath24 . if the orbits are escape orbits where @xmath33 ( i.e. the two solitary waves eventually separate from each other after weak interactions ) , then the exit velocities @xmath34 can be calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ heps ] ) and ( [ mdef ] ) as @xmath35 , which determines the amplitudes of exiting solitary waves , can also be obtained as @xmath36 .",
    "thus @xmath37 is a key parameter for the prediction of weak - interaction outcomes . in order to calculate @xmath37",
    ", we notice that for weak wave interactions and when @xmath27 , the ode solutions [ such as @xmath38 oscillate near a sequence of separatrix orbits of the unperturbed ( @xmath23 ) system before they escape to infinity . on these separatrix orbits ,",
    "if we consecutively enumerate the minimums of @xmath40 ( where interactions are the weakest ) and denote their energy and momentum values as @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( where @xmath1 is the index of the @xmath43-minimum ) , then we can analytically calculate @xmath41 and @xmath42 successively by integrating along the separatrix orbits of the unperturbed system .",
    "this was done in @xcite , and we found that for @xmath27 , @xmath41 does not change , i.e. @xmath44 for all @xmath45 . but @xmath42 does change . in the asymptotic limit of @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    ", we found that the change of @xmath42 is asymptotically governed by the following second - order separatrix map @xmath48 with initial conditions @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 here the multi - valued functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 are chosen uniquely by requiring @xmath56 and @xmath57 at the initial time .",
    "the variable @xmath58 in the above map is an auxiliary variable which is related to the function @xmath59 .",
    "when the odes ( [ eqdyfinal ] ) are integrable ( @xmath23 ) , @xmath59 is a conserved quantity . in this case , the integrable solution @xmath40 develops finite - time singularity if @xmath60 , or @xmath61 , see @xcite for details .",
    "these finite - time singularities play important roles in the formation of fractal scatterings .",
    "indeed , it was observed from numerical simulations in @xcite that fractal structures for @xmath24 bifurcate out from points where integrable solutions develop finite - time singularities .",
    "this fact will be proved in this paper by the analysis of the map .    the map ( [ map1])-([map2 ] ) can be normalized into a very simple form .",
    "let @xmath62 then this map becomes @xmath63 this normalized map is second - order , and it does not contain any free parameters ( except a sign of @xmath22 ) . thus it is universal for all weak two - wave interactions in the generalized nls equations ( [ eqgnls ] ) with arbitrary nonlinearities . for positive and negative signs of @xmath22 , we will show this map has completely different behaviors .",
    "this explains why fractal scatterings appear in odes ( [ eqdyfinal ] ) only when @xmath64 , but not when @xmath65 .",

    "we take two types of initial conditions for the two solitary waves in the pde ( [ eqgnls ] ) .",

    "clearly every periodic point can not lie on a singular curve @xmath139 with a finite binary sequence @xmath141 in view of the definition ( [ gammaa ] ) of @xmath139 .",
    "but a periodic point can be viewed as being on a singular curve with an infinite binary sequence @xmath141 whose digits are the signs of @xmath191 of the successive iteration points which repeat with the same period as the periodic point ( here a singular curve with an infinite binary sequence can be defined as the limit of the singular curve with a finite binary sequence ) . using this viewpoint , we can understand where periodic points should be located in the map s fractal .",
    "for instance , in the period - two orbit \\{@xmath102 , @xmath103 } , the first point @xmath102 lies on the singular curve with the binary sequence @xmath192 , while the second point @xmath103 lies on the singular curve with the binary sequence @xmath193 .",
    "for another instance , in the period - four orbit \\{@xmath104 } , the point @xmath194 lies on the singular curve with a binary sequence @xmath195 , and the point @xmath196 lies on the singular curve with a binary sequence @xmath197 , etc .",
    "the singular curves with these infinite binary sequences can be identified by the same scheme as we detailed above , thus we can ascertain where these periodic points are located in the map s fractal .",
    "obviously these infinite binary sequences of periodic points are infinitely close to their finite truncations , and points on the singular curves with truncated finite binary sequences have very different trajectories from those of the periodic points .",
    "thus the periodic points of the map @xmath97 are all unstable .    from the above singular - curve identification scheme , we see that all the singular curves on the right half of the @xmath134 plane lie between two special accumulation curves , @xmath198 and @xmath199 ( see figs .",

    "so does the fractal of the map on the right half plane as well ( see fig .",

    "similar to the above tracking and identification of singular curves , we can also track how regions in the @xmath111 plane move under the map @xmath97 .",
    "this is helpful for us to see how the orbit of an initial point moves in the @xmath111 plane .",

    "<S> previous studies have shown that fractal scatterings in weak interactions of solitary waves in the generalized nonlinear schrdinger equations are described by a universal second - order separatrix map . in this paper , this separatrix map is analyzed in detail , and hence a complete characterization of fractal scatterings in these weak interactions is obtained . in particular , scaling laws of these fractals are derived analytically for different initial conditions , and these laws are confirmed by direct numerical simulations . in addition , an analytical criterion for the occurrence of fractal scatterings is given explicitly .    </S>",
