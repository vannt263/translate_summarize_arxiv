    "two kinds of formulations for nonperturbative string theory have been known  matrix formulation and string field theory ( sft ) .",
    "background independence of sft is not manifest since it superficially depends on particular background . on the other hand ,",
    "matrix formulation is background independent while a particular background is realized non - trivially .",
    "a common belief is that these two formulations are complementary representations of underlying theory .",
    "thus , it is important to establish equivalence between two formulations . in fact",
    ", concrete examples that reduce open cubic sft  @xcite to certain matrix models have been known .",
    "one is sfts for topological a and b models  @xcite which reduce to ordinary and holomorphic chern - simons theories respectively .",
    "these theories further reduce to to chern - simons matrix model  @xcite and ordinary hermitian matrix models  @xcite respectively .",
    "the other is sft for ( 2,1 ) minimal string  @xcite , whose action reduces to kontsevich matrix model .",
    "in addition , there have been known less direct examples for @xmath2 string  @xcite , @xmath3 string  @xcite and critical string  @xcite . in most of above examples ,",
    "the dictionary between sfts and its dual theories has been filled model by model , since it is inevitable to specify particular boundary cft in order to define an open sft .    in this paper",
    ", we would like to propose an alternative approach to obtain matrix models from sft .",
    "our idea is quite simple : instead of finding simpler background that reduces the string fields to finite numbers of fields , we start with more general setup in critical string , and approximate string field to its first few components .",
    "an example which will be studied in this paper is based on the universal sector  @xcite of critical ( @xmath4 ) open sft , where the string field can be approximated as @xmath5 where each string field carries chan - paton indexes only .",
    "then , the open cubic sft  @xcite immediately reduces to a cubic multi - matrix model @xmath6    +   b_{m n p } { \\mathrm{tr}}\\left [ m_m m_n m_p\\right ] , \\label{141247_2jul15}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is a hermitian matrix .",
    "the approximation should improve quickly as @xmath8 increases .",
    "a successful example of such approximation has been know as _",
    "level truncation _ @xcite according to the spectrum of a kinetic operator of sft .",
    "it has been known that the approximation gets improved quickly as level increases .",
    "correspondingly , it is expected that a matrix model improves `` resolution '' of its dual spacetime .",
    "for example , the lowest level truncation of ( [ 141247_2jul15 ] ) yields an one - matrix model , which can be interpreted as @xmath9 noncritical string theory  @xcite . as level increases , more matrices",
    "are included to give a multi matrix model which is expected to give more nontrivial spacetime",
    ". then large @xmath8 limit will define certain kind of quantum gravity which contains large variety of possible spacetimes .",
    "such unified view for dual spacetimes is difficult to obtain by `` model by model '' studies which had been made in past .",
    "sft offers unified framework for matrix models as an approximation of the complete string field",
    ".    a possible reason that such direction has not yet been examined may be the lack of understanding of chan - paton factors in sft , which is indispensable for the large @xmath1 analysis .",
    "although they can be incorporated into sft consistently , their origin should be explained within sft as they represent dynamical objects , d - branes .",
    "recently , erler and maccaferri proposed a new construction of classical solutions of open sft in terms of the regularized boundary conditions changing ( bcc ) projectors  @xcite .",
    "their method covers wide range of backgrounds including multiple d - branes , which is main interest of this paper .",
    "following their work , kishimoto , masuda , takahashi and takemoto ( kmtt ) demonstrated that chan - paton factors naturally arise from the decomposition of string field in terms of the regularized bcc projectors  @xcite .",
    "string field theory expanded around the multiple d - branes solution was interpreted as a system of @xmath10 d - branes where a d - brane is at the tachyon vacuum .",
    "we would like to employ their formulation as our staring point to obtain matrix models .",
    "this paper organized as follows .",
    "section [ 054043_3jul15 ] introduces kmtt formulation . in section [ 012008_7jul15 ]",
    ", we derive an one matrix model in terms of the level truncation . in section [ 054237_3jul15 ]",
    "we derive the partition function of the model both in finite and large @xmath1 .",
    "section [ 054304_3jul15 ] summarizes our results and future direction will be discussed .",
    "let us briefly review the kmtt formulation  @xcite of open string field theory .",
    "their starting point is the classical solution of open string field theory proposed by erler and maccaferri  @xcite , which describes multiple d - branes : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the tachyon vacuum solution and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are regularized bcc projectors which obey @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the kinetic operator at a tachyon vacuum defined by @xmath17 apparently the index @xmath18 corresponds to chan - paton factor which labels d - branes .",
    "however , the solution ( [ 163417_20jun15 ] ) is `` diagonal '' with respect to it .",
    "it is obvious that off - diagonal components are also necessary for a sft which describes d - branes with non - abelian gauge symmetry .",
    "authors of ref .",
    "@xcite realized desired off - diagonal components in terms of the decomposition @xmath19 by evaluating sft action for a string field @xmath20 according to this decomposition , they derived the action @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the kinetic operator defined by @xmath26 .",
    "the trace in ( [ 161644_21jun15 ] ) runs over @xmath18 , and identical indexes in ( [ 162221_21jun15 ] ) are to be summed .",
    "we have ignored constant shift of the action , which amount to a sum of d - brane tensions .",
    "authors of ref .",
    "@xcite identified this system as @xmath10 d - branes rather than @xmath1 d - branes .",
    "in addition to @xmath1 unstable d - branes , there is a `` d - brane '' at the tachyon vacuum . according to their interpretation , @xmath27 connects two unstable d - branes @xmath18 and @xmath28 while @xmath29 connects d - brane @xmath18 with the d - brane at the tachyon vacuum .",
    "@xmath30 represents fluctuation on the d - brane at the tachyon vacuum .",
    "a remarkable feature of the action ( [ 163204_21jun15 ] ) is the presence of the `` vector '' sector described by @xmath29 and @xmath31 , which has not yet been considered in literature .",
    "the action is quadratic for them therefore they can be integrated out in the partition function .",
    "this integration requires specific choice of gauge . with assuming suitable gauge fixing",
    ", path integral for @xmath29 and @xmath32 yields a determinant factor @xmath33 in the partition function . in following sections",
    ", we evaluate this determinant by truncating string field rather than imposing conventional gauge condition such as linear gauge @xcite .",
    "although the string fields presented in previous section carry chan - paton factors , they also depend on infinitely many labels which distinguish each states in a boundary cft . in order to make our analysis simpler",
    ", we would like to introduce a truncation such that dynamical valuables are reduced to matrices .",

    "as a specific example of level 1 truncation , we set @xmath49 this assignment of coefficients means that the string field is proportional to erler - schnabl solution  @xcite : @xmath50 then , the truncation with another representation of the tachyon vacuum solution , since we do not require its explicit form in following analysis . ] is given by @xmath51 this truncation just provide first few components of the whole string field .",
    "however , we expect that our truncation well captures the essence of the dynamics of d - branes , as has been the case for the conventional level truncation analysis .",
    "in fact , our truncation interpolates between two vacua : one is the erler - maccaferri s multiple d - branes denoted as @xmath52 while the other is the perturbative vacuum , also denoted as @xmath53 .",
    "let us derive truncated action .",

    "explicit evaluation of the partition function for ( [ 220347_24jun15 ] ) can be carried out by the standard technique of matrix model . as readily found from ( [ 220347_24jun15 ] ) , the action is invariant under @xmath0 transformation @xmath62 , where @xmath63 denotes an @xmath0 matrix",
    "this is a residual gauge symmetry of the kmtt action @xcite .",

    "this vector can be integrated out so that inserts a factor @xmath76 in the matrix integral . in double scaling limit , this determinant is identified with a fzzt brane  @xcite , and the fermionic vector is identified with fermionic strings between a fzzt brane and a stuck of @xmath1 zz branes  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the action of our model ( [ 220347_24jun15 ] ) contains _ bosonic _ vector @xmath67 instead of fermionic one .",
    "integration with respect to it yields a factor @xmath77 in the partition function .",
    "comparison between ( [ 060544_12jul15 ] ) and ( [ 095328_6jul15 ] ) naturally identifies the determinant ( [ 095328_6jul15 ] ) as a _ ghost _ fzzt brane which cancels the effect of a fzzt brane .",
    "unfortunately , corresponding observable in minimal string theory has not yet identified as it is rather exotic .",
    "in this section , we will evaluate the effective potential for @xmath78 in terms of saddle point equations for eigenvalues .",
    "in large @xmath1 limit of thooft expansion , saddle point configurations give a leading contributions to the matrix integral . even for finite @xmath1",
    ", saddle point configurations also offer good approximation to the matrix integral when @xmath79 is small . in either case ,",
    "saddle point equations are obtained by varying ( [ 173139_5jan15 ] ) : @xmath80      let us study the dynamics of this matrix model at finite @xmath1 .",
    "we begin with @xmath81 , which corresponds to a system of a unstable d - brane and another d - brane at the tachyon vacuum . denoting @xmath65 as @xmath82 , the potential ( [ 173139_5jan15 ] )",
    "is given by @xmath83 and saddle point equations are @xmath84 by combining two equations above , we have a coupling independent equation @xmath85 which has two roots @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the latter is not appropriate since it hits the singularity @xmath88 in the partition function .",
    "therefore we choose @xmath89 as our solution .",
    "given this choice , ( [ 110209_25dec14 ] ) and ( [ 110219_25dec14 ] ) reduce to single equation @xmath90 this can be rewritten in cubic equation , @xmath91 whose roots correspond to saddle points .",
    "it is easily understood that while there are three roots for small @xmath79 , two roots disappear beyond critical value of @xmath79 .",
    "let us discuss further details of these roots .",

    "analysis have been made here is not an exact one but just classical approximation . however , as present example is enough simple , we can perform one of the integral without relying on the saddle point method .",
    "let us change variables as @xmath95 then , the partition function can be written as @xmath96 where we performed gaussian integral for @xmath97 in the second line . from this",
    ", we obtain one dimensional effective potential @xmath98 it should be noted the saddle point approximation corresponds to setting @xmath99 in ( [ 071139_3may15 ] ) , since we choose @xmath86 in the saddle point analysis .",
    "this gives @xmath100 therefore , difference between saddle point versus exact analysis is seen in the coefficient of logarithmic term which come form the determinant .",
    "it is well understood that the saddle point approximation works fine for small @xmath79 .",

    "this phenomena corresponds to the annihilation of saddle points observed in the saddle point analysis .",
    "such dependence of the effective potential on the coupling is consistent with the nature of the d - brane which gives an effective description of the system at small @xmath79 .    , where solid line is a plot for @xmath102 while dashed line is for @xmath103 .",

    "we also observed that the sum of all eigenvalues is close to its value of potential , i.e. , @xmath116 finally , it is also interesting to see that the maximum value of the potential is close to @xmath117 for all @xmath1 .",
    "this can be regarded as a change of potential height of the effective potential .",
    "we would like close this subsection with a summary of our result for finite @xmath1 :    * the stable vacuum is lost for large coupling .",
    "this indicates breakdown of d - brane description .",
    "the critical value of the coupling can be determined by saddle point equations .",

    "we begin with the partition function @xmath119 and introduce the thooft coupling @xmath120 then , saddle point equations read @xmath121 @xmath122 in large @xmath1 limit , eigenvalues are described by a continuous distribution @xmath123 and a sum for eigenvalues is replaced with a integral @xmath124 then , saddle point equations can be expressed as @xmath125 @xmath126 at leading order , the second term in ( [ 072108_7jul15 ] ) becomes negligible",
    ". then we have saddle point equations @xmath127 @xmath128 the latter equation solves the planar limit of cubic matrix model , whose solution can be found elsewhere @xcite .",

    "requiring @xmath132 at infinity , we obtain equations @xmath133 @xmath134 which solve @xmath18 and @xmath28 as functions of @xmath135 .",

    "the shape of the effective potential is shown in fig .",
    "[ 070117_3jul15 ] for different values of @xmath135 .",
    "it turns out that the global structure of the potential remains same even after including the effect of infinitely many unstable d - branes .",
    "this is consistent with taking thooft limit , in which @xmath79 is small so that the d - brane description is kept valid . on the other hand , the height of the potential always becomes higher than that of the original potential .",
    "the height is maximum at @xmath151 where it amounts to twice of the original value . while the height decreases as @xmath135 increases , it is still higher than the original one even at maximum value of @xmath135 .",
    "the increase of height can be understood from the particle description of eigenvalues .",
    "eigenvalues filled at the bottom of @xmath118 pull the tachyon @xmath78 due to attractive force .",
    "it makes harder for @xmath78 to climb the potential wall , thus results effective increase of the potential height",
    ". such behavior of @xmath78 is quite different from that of the probe eigenvalue model investigated in literature @xcite where a plateau along the eigenvalue distribution is observed .",
    "the existence of the plateau had been explained from the fact that a probe eigenvalue can not be distinguished from others .",
    "our model has no plateau since @xmath78 can be distinguished from other eigenvalues .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a systematic method to derive matrix models form level truncated sft . obtained",
    "matrix model contains an @xmath0 vector and a scalar in addition to hermite matrix .",
    "we have evaluated effective potential for the scalar both in finite and large @xmath1 .",
    "increase of the potential height have been observed at small string coupling .",
    "the advantage of matrix model is that it allows various interpretation as it is universal tool to investigate nonperturbative dynamics . in section [ 012008_7jul15 ]",
    ", we have interpreted our result as a ghost fzzt brane . here",
    "we would like to try to an alternative , rather heuristic interpretation .",
    "let us go back to the inverse of determinant before matrix truncation : @xmath152 the basic idea is that this quantity can be regarded as a propagator with @xmath153 and @xmath30 insertions . recall that this factor is obtained by an integration of @xmath29 which connects a d - brane with the tachyon vacuum where there is no boundary .",
    "therefore , it is natural to think that ( [ 232312_6jul15 ] ) amounts to a disk amplitude rather than annulus amplitude .",
    "schematically , such disk amplitude can be written @xmath154 in the effective potential .",
    "as is well known , small @xmath78 limit of such amplitude corresponds to closed string propagation  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the inverse determinant can be interpreted as gravitational interaction between @xmath1 d - branes and the tachyon vacuum and @xmath78 observed in section [ 012008_7jul15 ] . ] . the matrix model considered in previous section",
    "can be understood as an approximation of the above system . in this way ,",
    "minimal string theory with fzzt and zz branes arises as an approximation of critical string .",
    "such relation between critical and noncritical theories maybe has been imagined , but has never been explicitly realized since these two theories should be treated in different boundary cfts in perturbative treatment .",
    "we would like to mention more matrix issues .",
    "one possible extension of our result is an inclusion of higher level fields to obtain multi - matrix models .",
    "for example , a two matrix model can be obtained by including a level @xmath155 field .",
    "it is interesting to see whether such model can be interpreted as minimal string .",
    "inclusion of more than three fields gives a multi matrix model whose interpretations is more nontrivial .",
    "more ambitious direction is the matrix description of the whole sector string field theory without relying on the kmtt decomposition . in this case ,",
    "matrix indexes will be realized in terms of left - right splitting of the open strings , which has been examined in past @xcite .",
    "the kmtt assignment of indexes looks quite different from that expected from the the left - right splitting .",
    "we expect that all ingredients of kmtt , including chan - paton factors and regularized bcc projectors , are embedded in the left - right splitting in very nontrivial manner .    together with recent developments which deals with different backgrounds as classical solutions  @xcite , our result supplies further evidence for sft as a unified framework of nonperturbative string theory .",
    "we hope further developments in this direction will shed light on the landscape of string theory ."
