    "in this lecture the application of the single - freeze - out statistical model @xcite to the final data on the @xmath0 spectra of identified charged particles measured in the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at @xmath1 and 200 gev @xcite is reviewed . details of this analysis can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the foundations of the model are as follows : ( _ a _ ) the chemical and thermal freeze - outs take place simultaneously , ( _ b _ ) all confirmed resonances up to a mass of @xmath3 gev from the particle data tables @xcite are taken into account , ( _ c _ ) a freeze - out hypersurface is defined by the equation @xmath4 , ( _ d _ ) the four - velocity of an element of the freeze - out hypersurface is proportional to its coordinate , @xmath5 , ( _ e _ ) the transverse size is restricted by the condition @xmath6 .",
    "the maximum transverse - flow parameter can be expressed as @xmath7 .",
    "the model has four parameters , namely , the two thermal parameters , the temperature @xmath8 and the baryon number chemical potential @xmath9 , and the two geometric parameters , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    with the use of the following parametrization of the hypersurface",
    "@xmath12    the invariant distribution of the measured particles of species @xmath13 can be expressed in the form    @xmath14    where    @xmath15    and @xmath16 is the final momentum distribution of the particle in question .",
    "the final distribution means here that @xmath16 is the sum of primordial and simple and sequential decay contributions to the particle distribution ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "having integrated the distribution , eq .",
    "( [ cooper2 ] ) , over @xmath0 and summing over appropriate final particles , one can obtain transverse energy ( @xmath17 ) and charged particle multiplicity ( @xmath18 ) densities at mid - rapidity ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the experimentally measured transverse energy is defined as    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the polar angle , @xmath21 denotes @xmath22 ( @xmath23 means the nucleon mass ) for baryons , @xmath24 for antibaryons and the total energy @xmath25 for all other particles , and the sum is taken over all @xmath26 emitted particles @xcite .    in the case of expansion satisfying the condition @xmath27 on a freeze - out hypersurface ( as here ) , the total multiplicity of particle species @xmath13 can be derived in the form    @xmath28    if the local thermal parameters are constant on this hypersurface .",
    "the density @xmath29 is not the primordial thermal density of particle species @xmath13 but it collects also contributions from decays of resonances . the last integral in eq .",
    "( [ totmult ] ) expresses the hypersurface volume and if the rapidity of the fluid element @xmath30 is unlimited ( eq .  ( [ cooper2 ] ) ) , then this volume will be infinite . thus @xmath30 is assumed to have its maximal value @xmath31 .",
    "then the volume can be expressed as @xmath32 and the total multiplicity of charged particles is obtained :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 . for @xmath31",
    "the following parametrization is obtained ( for details see @xcite ) :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the projectile rapidity , @xmath37 the average rapidity loss and @xmath38 is a fractional number representing the middle of a given centrality bin , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath39 for the @xmath40 centrality bin , etc ..",
    "studies of the particle ratios and @xmath0 spectra at various centralities in the framework of the single freeze - out model were done for the preliminary rhic data at @xmath41 gev @xcite in @xcite .",
    "the procedure has two stages .",
    "first , thermal parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 are fitted with the use of the experimental ratios of hadron multiplicities at midrapidity .",
    "after then two next parameters , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are determined from the simultaneous fit to the transverse - momentum spectra of @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "both fits are performed with the help of the @xmath46 method . since ( _ a _ )",
    "the preliminary data for the @xmath0 spectra @xcite differ from the final data @xcite , ( _ b _ ) not all bins were fitted in @xcite , ( _ c _ ) the data points were digitized from the plots in @xcite , the fit procedure for determination of the geometric parameters of the model , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , has been performed again . for completeness",
    "the phenix case at @xmath1 gev has been repeated , since the first published data were for three bins only @xcite .",
    "the data for the next two bins , which were not fitted in @xcite , were added in the later report @xcite . also the brahms spectra measured at @xmath41 gev @xcite have not been fitted within this model until now .",
    "the thermal parameters for the three cases of the maximal rhic collision energy have been taken from the newer studies of the particle abundance ratios @xcite .",
    "the final results for the geometric parameters @xmath11 and @xmath10 are gathered in table  [ table1 ] together with the corresponding values of @xmath47 and @xmath46/ndf for each centrality class characterized by the number of participants @xmath48 .",
    "all fits are statistically significant beside the most peripheral bins of the phenix measurements .",

    "the estimates are based on the fits of the parameters of the model which are done in the first stage . while the thermal parameters have been taken from independent fits to the particle yield ratios ,",
    "the geometric parameters have been determined from the final data on the @xmath0-spectra of identified charged hadrons .",
    "the consistent picture of the freeze - out has been obtained within the model since the global variables are measured independently of identified hadron spectroscopy and their predictions agree fairly well with the data .",
    "it should be stressed that the model reproduces the centrality independence of the total charged - particle multiplicity per participating pair and the predicted values agree with the measured ones within @xmath59 .",
    "this is surprising since geometric parameters have been fitted to spectra measured at midrapidity , but the total charged - particle multiplicity is measured in the whole rapidity range .    the author would like to thank jan rafelski for very helpful comments and discussions .",
