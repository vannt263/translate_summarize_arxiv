    "an open question in classical knot theory is the question of when a crossing change in a knot changes the isotopy class of the knot .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to answer this question for fibered knots .",
    "a crossing disc for a knot @xmath5 is an embedded disc @xmath6 such that @xmath1 intersects @xmath7 twice with zero algebraic intersection number .",
    "a crossing change on @xmath1 can be achieved by twisting @xmath8 or equivalently by performing appropriate dehn surgery of @xmath9 along the crossing circle @xmath10 .",
    "the crossing is called nugatory if and only if @xmath10 bounds an embedded disc in the complement of @xmath1 . this disc and",
    "@xmath8 form a 2-sphere that decomposes @xmath1 into a connected sum , where some of the summands may be trivial . clearly , changing a nugatory crossing does nt change the isotopy class of a knot .",
    "problem 1.58 of kirby s problem list ( @xcite ) , asks whether the converse is true : that is , if a crossing change in a knot @xmath1 yields a knot isotopic to @xmath1 is the crossing nugatory ?    in the case that @xmath1 is the trivial knot an affirmative answer follows from a deep result of d. gabai ( @xcite ) that describes the behavior of the thurston norm under dehn filling ( see @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "i. torisu obtained an affirmative answer for 2-bridge knots .",
    "he also observed that in general the question can be reduced to the analogous question for prime knots .",
    "the argument of @xcite first uses the so called  montesinos trick \" to realize the crossing change on a knot by dehn surgery in the 2-fold cover of @xmath9 branching over the knot .",
    "the 2-fold covers of 2-bridge knots are lens spaces and the result follows by applying the cyclic surgery theorem of culler , gordon , luecke and shalen ( @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we will show the following .",
    "[ theo : nugatory ] let @xmath1 be a fibered knot .",
    "a crossing change in @xmath1 yields a knot isotopic to @xmath1 if and only if the crossing is nugatory .",
    "the main ingredients of the proof of theorem [ theo : nugatory ] are the aforementioned result of gabai on the thurston norm and dehn surgery , and a result of d. kotschick about the `` commutator length '' of certain products of dehn twists in the mapping class group of surfaces . to give a brief outline of the proof , let @xmath1 be a fibered knot such that a crossing change on @xmath1 gives a knot @xmath3 that is isotopic to @xmath1 .",
    "the complement of @xmath1 can be fibered over @xmath11 with fiber , say @xmath12 ; a minimum genus seifert surface of @xmath1 . roughly speaking",
    ", gabai s result implies that the crossing change from @xmath1 to @xmath3 can be achieved along an arc that is properly embedded on @xmath12 .",
    "equivalently , the crossing change can be achieved by twisting @xmath1 along a meridian disc @xmath8 of a handlebody neighborhood , say @xmath13 , of the fiber . using properties of heegaard splittings and mapping class groups of handlebodies we are able to show that , in many cases , @xmath10 must bound an embedded disc whose interior is disjoint from @xmath1 . in the remaining cases , using the uniqueness properties of knot complement fibrations , the problem reduces to the question of whether a power of a denh twist on the surface @xmath14 along the curve @xmath10 , can be written as a single commutator in the mapping class group of the surface . in the recent years",
    ", this question has arisen in the study of lefschetz fibrations and the theory of symplectic 4-manifolds and has been studied in this context ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", a result of kotschick ( @xcite ) implies that a product of dehn twists of the same sign , along a collection of disjoint , homotopically essential curves on an orientable surface can not be written as a single commutator in the mapping class group of the surface . using this result , we show that the assumption that @xmath1 is isotopic to @xmath3 implies that @xmath10 must be contractible on @xmath14 .",
    "this , in turn , easily implies that the crossing corresponding to @xmath8 is nugatory .",
    "0.04 in    theorem [ theo : nugatory ] says that an essential crossing change always changes the isotopy class of a fibered knot .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the crossing change produces a simpler or more complicated knot with respect to some knot complexity .",
    "a complexity function whose interplay with crossing changes has been studied using the theory of taut foliations and sutured 3-manifolds is the knot genus . for example",
    "@xcite studies the interplay of link genus and conway skein moves .",
    "simple examples show that a single crossing change may decrease or increase the genus of a knot even if one stays within the class of fibered knots .",
    "however by replacing a crossing change by the more refined notion of knot adjacency studied in @xcite , we are able to derive stronger conclusions . to state a result in this direction , we recall that @xmath1 is called 2-adjacent to @xmath3 if @xmath1 admits a projection that contains two crossings such that changing any of them or both of them simultaneously , transforms @xmath1 to @xmath3 .",
    "[ theo : unique1 ] let @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the genera of @xmath1 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "suppose that @xmath3 is a fibered knot and that @xmath1 is 2-adjacent to @xmath3 .",
    "then , either @xmath17 or @xmath1 is isotopic to @xmath3 .",
    "it is well known that the alexander polynomial can be used to detect non - fibered knots .",
    "theorem [ theo : unique1 ] , and its generalization given in section 7 , can be used to obtain criteria for detecting non - fibered knots when the alexander polynomial provides inconclusive evidence .",
    "this direction is explored in @xcite where we also provide applications in the theory of finite type invariants of 3-manifolds .",
    "we organize the paper paper as follows : in section 2 we summarize the mapping class group results that we need for the proof of theorem [ theo : nugatory ] .",
    "in section 3 we discuss basic facts about curves and discs in handlebodies and prove two technical lemmas that we use in subsequent sections . in section 4",
    "we summarize some well known uniqueness properties of knot complement fibrations .",
    "then , in section 5 we develop a setting relating fibrations of knot complements and heegaard splittings of @xmath9 , from the point of view needed in the rest of the paper . in section 6 , we study nugatory crossings of fibered knots and we prove theorem [ theo : nugatory ] ; in fact we prove a more general result . in section 7",
