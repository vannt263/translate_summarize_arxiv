    "observations of ly@xmath0 absorption lines in the spectra of qsos provide a sensitive probe of the evolution and the distribution of the gas in the universe from high to low redshift .",
    "a forest of h@xmath5i  absorption lines occurs at different redshifts , @xmath2 , along qso sightlines with @xmath17 . understanding the evolution of the ly@xmath0 forest with redshift is critical to understanding the evolution and formation of structures in the universe . at @xmath18 ,",
    "observations of the ly@xmath0 forest are obtained from ground - based telescopes at a spectral resolution of 78 @xmath9  using 810 m class telescopes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but at @xmath19 they require uv space - based instruments .",
    "space - based uv astronomy has produced remarkable results , including the discovery itself of the ly@xmath0 forest at low redshift @xcite .",
    "however , most of the uv studies of the igm at low @xmath2 have lacked the spectral resolution and wavelength coverage of the higher redshift studies @xcite , requiring assumptions for the doppler parameter to derive the column density .",
    "the situation at @xmath20 has dramatically improved in the last few years with high quality observations of several low redshift qsos obtained with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _  and its space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) . in its e140 m echelle mode",
    ", stis provides a spectral resolution of @xmath167 @xmath9 , comparable to the resolution of the high redshift observations of the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "the high spectral resolution has allowed the derivation of accurate doppler parameters , @xmath11 , and column densities , @xmath21 , using techniques similar to those used at high redshift .",
    "the doppler parameter is important because it is related to the temperature of the gas via @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the non - thermal broadening of the absorption line and @xmath24 is the thermal broadening of the h@xmath5i  absorption line ; therefore the measured @xmath11 directly provides an upper limit to the temperature of the observed gas .    in parallel , hydrodynamic cosmological simulations of the local universe",
    "have quickly evolved in recent years @xcite .",
    "these models predict that at low redshift roughly 3050% of the baryons are in a hot ( 57 k ) and highly ionized intergalactic medium ( igm ) known as the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) , 3040% are in a cooler medium ( @xmath25 k ) photoionized by the uv background , and the remaining baryons are in galaxies .",
    "observationally , @xcite found with moderate spectral resolution ( fwhm@xmath1620 @xmath9 ) uv observations that the cool phase of the igm may contain 29% of the baryon budget .",
    "the observational detection of the whim came first from an intensive search of collisionally - ionized o@xmath5vi  systems and other highly ionized species such as ne@xmath5viii   using space - based observatories such as the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "( _ fuse _ ) and _ hst_/stis ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the baryon content of the o@xmath5vi  absorbers suggests that @xmath26o@xmath5vi@xmath27 or at least 5% of the total baryon budget @xcite , but this estimate relies critically on the assumed oxygen abundance and the number of collisionally ionized o@xmath5vi  systems versus photoionized o@xmath5vi  systems @xcite . the o@xmath5vi  systems probe the lower end of the whim temperature range ( @xmath28 k ) .",
    "higher temperatures can be traced with more highly ionized oxygen ions ( o@xmath5vii , o@xmath5viii ) that can be observed in principle with x - ray observatories such as _ chandra _",
    "@xcite and _ xmm - newton _ , but the igm detections of o@xmath5vii  and o@xmath5viii  are still controversial @xcite for @xmath29",
    ".    the whim can also be detected through broad h@xmath5i  absorption lines .",
    "the high temperature of the whim will broaden the ly@xmath0 absorption line resulting in a large doppler parameter ( @xmath12 @xmath9 ) . a very small fraction of h@xmath5i  ( typically @xmath30 ) is expected to be found in the highly ionized plasma of the whim , so that the broader the h@xmath5i  absorption line is , the shallower it should be .",
    "recent observations , both with moderate spectral resolution and with the higher - resolution stis e140 m echelle mode , have revealed the presence of broad h@xmath5i  absorption lines that could be modeled by smooth and broad gaussian components @xcite .",
    "h@xmath5i  absorbers with @xmath31 @xmath9",
    "imply that the temperature of these absorbers must be @xmath32 k. since the nominal lower temperature of the whim is @xmath33 k , it is _ a priori _  natural to consider two different physical populations of h@xmath5i  absorbers : the narrow ly@xmath0 absorbers ( nlas ) as h@xmath5i  systems having @xmath31 @xmath9  and the broad ly@xmath0 absorbers ( blas ) as h@xmath5i  systems having @xmath34 @xmath9 .",
    "we will see that the separation between the nlas and blas is not so evident observationally , with an important overlap between the two populations , particularly in the range @xmath3550 @xmath9 . while it is clear that the nlas are tracing mostly the cool photoionized igm , the situation is less clear for the blas .",
    "there is a fuzziness in the separation of the blas from the nlas because non - thermal broadening can be important and unresolved components can hide the true structure of the h@xmath5i  absorbers .",
    "recent simulations show that non - thermal broadening could be particularly important for the h@xmath5i  absorbers with @xmath36 @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "therefore blas may probe photoionized gas ( that can be either cool ( @xmath37 k ) or hot ( @xmath38 k ) but with a very low density ( @xmath39 ) ) _ and _   collisionally ionized , hot ( @xmath38 k ) gas . in this paper",
    ", we define a bla as an absorber that can be fitted with a single gaussian component with @xmath40 @xmath9   ( a nla has @xmath41 @xmath9  and can have multiple components ) .",
    "blas probe the igm that is either hotter ( @xmath42 ) or is more kinematically disturbed ( @xmath43 ) than the igm probed by the nlas . studying in detail the nla and bla populations is also important for estimating the baryon density because an accurate inventory of the baryon distribution must separate the fraction of the baryons that are located in the cool photoionized igm versus those that are in the substantially hotter shock - heated whim phase .",
    "the narrow and broad ly@xmath0 lines provide a means to discriminate between the cool and shock - heated gas clouds .",
    "therefore to make a reliable assessment of the baryonic content of the ly@xmath0 forest at low z , it is necessary to investigate the frequency and properties of the nlas and blas .",
    "the current estimate of the baryon budget residing in the blas over a redshift path @xmath44 yields @xmath45 or at least 6% of the total baryon budget @xcite , assuming that the observed broadening is mostly thermal and collisional ionization equilibrium applies .    in this paper",
    ", we will address these issues using a sample of 7 qso sightlines that have been observed with both stis e140 m and _ fuse _  and for which the data have been fully analyzed using similar techniques and are in press or to be submitted soon .",
    "while the spectral resolution of _ fuse _  is only @xmath1620 @xmath9  compared to @xmath167 @xmath9  for stis e140 m , _ fuse _  gives access to several lyman series and metal lines making the line identification more reliable and providing an unprecedented insight of the physical conditions and metallicity .",
    "the fundamental parameters of the ly@xmath0 forest lines ( redshift @xmath2 , column density @xmath21 , and doppler parameter @xmath11 ) were accurately determined using profile fitting of all the observed lyman series lines . because @xmath11 could be derived , this is the first time with a large sample that the properties of the ly@xmath0 forest in the low redshift universe can be studied as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "the main aims of this work are 1 ) to study the distribution and evolution of the doppler parameter of the ly@xmath0 forest , and 2 ) to determine the baryon density of the ly@xmath0 forest in the nla and bla populations .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows :  [ datasample ] describes the sample and its completeness ; in  [ bdistr ] we study the distribution of the doppler parameter @xmath11 and the ly@xmath0 density number as a function of @xmath11 ; in  [ sec - evol ] we study the evolution of @xmath11 with redshift by comparing the low-@xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) ly@xmath0 forest with the mid-@xmath2 ( @xmath46 ) and high-@xmath2 ( @xmath47 ) ly@xmath0 forest ; in  [ dddf ] we estimate the column density distribution ; and finally , in  [ bd ] we estimate the baryon content of the cool photoionized igm probed by the nlas and the photoionized igm and the whim probed by the blas , and discuss the uncertainties in estimating the baryon budget .",

    "we list in this table the observed wavelengths and the rest - frame equivalent widths of the ly@xmath0 transition .",
    "the listed column densities and doppler parameters were measured in the rest - frame by n. lehner ( nl ) following the method described in @xcite .",
    "the weak absorbers ( @xmath1098 ) were also independently measured by p. richter ( pr ) using the method described in @xcite .",
    "in particular , different profile fitting software was used by nl and pr . in fig .",
    "[ compmeas ] , we compare the column densities and @xmath11-values ( for the weak absorbers ) presented by @xcite to those listed in table  a1 ( left panels ) . on the right - hand side , we present the measurements obtained by pr against those listed in table  a1 . for both @xmath11 and @xmath53 , there is an excellent agreement between pr and nl measurements at the 1@xmath594 level .",
    "in contrast , williger et al .",
    "( gw ) found generally larger column densities and doppler parameters .",
    "the main difference between our analysis ( nl and pr ) and gw s analysis is that we systematically and _ independently _ chose the continua within @xmath10993000 @xmath9  of the h@xmath5i  absorption line , while gw fitted the continuum using a semi - automatic procedure ( autovp ) combined with custom fitting in the vicinity of the qso emission lines .",
    "since these weak absorbers are generally detected solely in ly@xmath0 , the continuum placement is critical .",
    "our method for the continuum placement was followed for all the other sightlines presented in this work . for the absorbers where ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath607 are detected , our measurements and",
    "those made by gw agree within 1@xmath594 .",
    "absorbers with @xmath844 are detected in several lyman series lines .",
    "for the absorbers that were fitted with a single component ( @xmath1100 ) , gw and our measurements are in agreement within 1@xmath594 .",
    "gw fitted the systems listed in table  a1 at @xmath1101 and ( 0.18262,0.18287 ) with a single component .",
    "we found that a 2-component fit provides a statistically better fit .",
    "the total column densities for those absorbers are in agreement within 1@xmath594 with those measured by gw . for the partial lyman limit system at @xmath1102 , we found that 5 components provide a better fit to this complicated absorber ( see fig .",
    "[ fitpks ] and note ( 6 ) in table  a1 ) .",
    "we note that our fit is not yet as good as it should be despite our best effort ( see fig .",
    "[ fitpks ] ) .",
    "in particular , the broad component at @xmath1103 may actually be narrower since metals - ions such as c@xmath5iii  are detected at this redshift ( this directly affects the measurements of the absorber at @xmath1104 where c@xmath5iii  is also detected ) . finally , we fitted the system at @xmath1105 with 4 components .",
    "this is not statistically different from the 2 component fit presented by gw , but the 4-component fit appears to be a better model when the kinematics of the metal - ions are taken into account ( see note ( 12 ) in table  a1 for more details ) .    in table",
    "a2 , we report the list of features that were identified as ly@xmath0 and claimed to be detected at least at the 4@xmath594 level by gw . these features are actually either non - detections at the 3@xmath594 level ( according to our measurements ) or were misidentified .",
    "the 181 ly@xmath0 absorbers toward pks0405123 reported by gw now reduce to 74 absorbers ( and in a few cases , those are multi - component absorbers ) .",
