    "the spin-@xmath0 chain with nearest - neighbor exchange coupling @xmath1 and next - nearest - neighbor coupling @xmath2 is one of the representatives of frustrated spin systems  @xcite . if @xmath2 is antiferromagnetic ( af ) i.e. , @xmath7 , the system has magnetic frustration regardless of the sign of @xmath1 .",
    "recently , several quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) edge - sharing cuprates  @xcite such as @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath5 , @xmath4 and @xmath6 , have been investigated as quantum multiferroic materials or frustrated magnets , and many of them are believed to be approximately described by a @xmath1-@xmath2 spin chain with ferromagnetic ( fm ) @xmath1 and af @xmath2  @xcite at least in the high temperature regime above their ordering temperatures .",
    "recent theoretical studies have elucidated effects of external magnetic field @xmath10 on the @xmath1-@xmath2 chain  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the field induces three multipolar tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) liquid phases , i.e. , quadrupolar , octupolar , and hexadecapolar tl - liquid phases , in the wide region of @xmath11 . in these three phases , multipolar operators",
    "@xmath12 with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are respectively shown to exhibit a quasi long - range order .",
    "in addition , in these phases , the longitudinal spin correlator also decays in an algebraic form , while the transverse spin correlator obeys an exponential - decay law .",
    "it is generally difficult to experimentally distinguish magnetic multipolar phases in spin systems .",
    "there is no established method of measuring multipolar correlations , and static quantities such as specific heat and susceptibility exhibit no large difference between the multipolar and standard tl liquids .",
    "recently , we have shown  @xcite for these multipolar tl liquids that ( i ) in contrast to usual tl - liquid phase , nuclear - magnetic - resonance ( nmr ) relaxation rate @xmath3 of the multipolar liquid phases decreases with lowering temperature near the saturation , and ( ii ) gapless points and peak positions of dynamical structure factors are clearly different from those of usual af spin chains .",
    "furthermore , in ref .",
    "@xcite we have numerically evaluated @xmath3 of the quadrupolar phase as a function of temperature and magnetic field , combining field theoretical approach with numerical data .",
    "the obtained result demonstrated that field dependence of @xmath3 is also characteristic : @xmath3 decreases with increasing the field except for the vicinity of saturation .",
    "these features of dynamical quantities would be helpful to detect multipolar tl liquids in experiments for the above quasi-1d magnets . in this paper , using the same method as ref .",
    "@xcite , we determine the field and temperature dependence of @xmath3 in the octupolar phase of spin-@xmath0 @xmath1-@xmath2 chain .",
    "the result is expected to be relevant for quasi-1d @xmath1-@xmath2 magnets with large fm @xmath16 .",
    "for instance , @xmath4 might be a possible candidate for the realization of octupolar tl liquid  @xcite .",
    "here we shortly review the low - energy properties of multipolar tl - liquid phases of spin-@xmath0 @xmath1-@xmath2 chain  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of @xmath1-@xmath2 chain under magnetic field @xmath10 is defined as @xmath17 where we focus on the case with @xmath18 and @xmath7 . for the saturated state in high - field regime ,",
    "two- , three- and four - magnon bound states with momentum @xmath19 , respectively , become the lowest - energy excitation in the regions @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) . with decreasing field @xmath10 below the saturation field ,",
    "these bound magnons are condensed , and the system can be regarded as a hard - core bose gas of bound magnons .",
    "we call these gases of two- , three- , and four - magnon bound states , respectively , the second , third , and fourth order multipolar ( quadrupolar , octupolar , and hexadecapolar ) tl liquids  @xcite .",
    "these multipolar phases expand from the saturation down to the low - field regime and turn into the low - field vector - chiral phase with @xmath26 . in the @xmath27-th order",
    "multipolar phase , correlation functions of both the longitudinal spin operator @xmath28 and the @xmath27-th multipolar operators @xmath29 ( i.e. , creation / annihilation operator of bound magnons ) can be calculated from the effective tl - liquid theory for the hard - core bose gas of multi - magnon bound states  @xcite .",
    "they are shown to decay algebraically as follows : @xmath30    \\label{eq : correlation_1}\\\\ \\langle \\prod_{n=1}^p s^+_{n}\\prod_{n=1}^p s^-_{j+n}\\rangle & = & ( -1)^j c_1 |j|^{-1/(2\\kappa)}+\\cdots , \\label{eq : correlation_2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the uniform magnetization per site , @xmath32 are nonuniversal constants , and @xmath33 is the tl - liquid parameter . on the other hand , correlators of @xmath34-th multipolar operators including",
    "transverse spin operator @xmath35 obey an exponential - decay form @xmath36  @xcite since any @xmath37-magnon excitation requires a finite excitation energy to break @xmath27-magnon bound states .",
    "the correlation length @xmath38 must be proportional to the inverse of the binding energy @xmath39 of magnons .",
    "the absence of the quasi - long - range order in the transverse - spin correlation plays a key role in the following discussion of nmr relaxation rate .",
    "for spin systems in solids , nmr relaxation time @xmath40 is usually determined through weak hyperfine interactions between electron and nuclear spins .",
    "therefore , we can obtain information about electron - spin correlations from measurement of @xmath40 . the formula for @xmath40",
    "@xcite is given by @xmath41 + a^2_{\\parallel}{\\cal s}^{zz}(\\omega ) , \\label{eq : t_1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 are the hyperfine coupling constants , and @xmath43 is the local dynamical structure factor @xmath44 the strength of @xmath42 depends on kinds of nuclei , crystal structures , and direction of field @xmath10 .",
    "the value of @xmath45 is fixed to a nearly resonating frequency of nuclear - spin precession motion , and it is generally much smaller than the energy scale of electron spin systems .",
    "therefore , we take the limit @xmath46 in the following discussions . utilizing these formulas , we will discuss the temperature and field dependence of @xmath3 in the octupolar liquid phase .",
    "from eqs .  ( [ eq : correlation_1 ] ) , ( [ eq : t_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : dynamical_st ] ) and field - theoretical method  @xcite , @xmath3 in the multipolar liquid phases is obtained as @xmath48 here , @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the excitation velocity , @xmath51 is lattice spacing , and @xmath52 is the beta function .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : nmr_boso ] ) is valid for the temperature regime @xmath53 , where the low - energy effective theory of the bound - magnon bose gas is reliable . if spatial dependence of hyperfine couplings is taken account of beyond the formula ( [ eq : t_1 ] ) , the prefactors @xmath54 in the first and second term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nmr_boso ] ) are generally modified and become different .",
    "the form of @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nmr_boso ] ) consists of contributions from the longitudinal spin correlation ; the first and second terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nmr_boso ] ) originate from the second and third terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : correlation_1 ] ) , respectively . remarkably , both terms are power - law type functions of temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "since the transverse spin correlation exhibits a gapped behavior , its contribution to @xmath3 is a thermal - activation form @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , if we consider the temperature region lower than the binding energy @xmath56 , the contribution from transverse spin correlation is negligible .",
    "the disappearance of transverse - spin contribution is a characteristic feature of multipolar tl liquids and makes the multipolar liquids distinct from the usual tl liquid in various quasi-1d af magnets as discussed below .",
    "parameters @xmath33 , @xmath50 , and @xmath57 can be evaluated as a function of field @xmath10 ( or magnetization @xmath58 ) and @xmath59 at zero temperature by using density - matrix renormalization group method  @xcite . substituting them into eq .",
    "( [ eq : nmr_boso ] ) , we obtain the temperature and field dependence of @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , the temperature dependence of each term is determined by the tl - liquid parameter @xmath33 . for the multipolar phases ,",
    "@xmath33 is known to increase almost monotonically with increasing @xmath10 ( or @xmath58 ) and approach unity at the saturation  @xcite .",
    "we can thereby find that @xmath3 decreases with lowering temperature in the high - field region with @xmath60 , while it diverges in the low - field region with @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "this behavior highly contrasts to the usual tl liquid such as that of the spin-@xmath0 af chain , in which one of the longitudinal- or transverse - spin contributions diverges at @xmath62 and @xmath3 is a monotonically increasing function of temperature in sufficiently low - temperature regime .",
    "furthermore , for the quadrupolar phase ( @xmath13 ) , the field dependence of @xmath3 has also been determined rather accurately  @xcite .",
    "it has then been shown that with increasing @xmath10 , @xmath3 decreases for low field regime and increases in the vicinity of the saturation field ( see fig . 1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite ) .",
    "this peculiar non - monotonic field dependence of @xmath3 is expected to be a common property of all the multipolar tl - liquid phases in the @xmath1-@xmath2 chain and would be also a hallmark of them .",
    "let us now examine the temperature and field dependence of @xmath3 in the octupolar tl - liquid phase ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "we evaluate @xmath3 combining the formula  ( [ eq : nmr_boso ] ) with numerical estimates of @xmath33 , @xmath50 , and @xmath57 which are obtained in the same manner as refs .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath64 is simply set to unity .",
    "hereafter , we concentrate on the point of @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , at which the octupolar phase widely exists for @xmath67 ( @xmath68 )  @xcite .",
    "we note that in the octupolar phase , the excitation velocity @xmath50 , i.e. , the width of low - energy excitation band , is rather small compared to those of quadrupolar phase  @xcite .",
    "for instance , we evaluate @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath72 at the point of @xmath65 .",
    "this is a natural result because the parameter region of the octupolar liquid phase is closer to the ferromagnetic instability point @xmath73 at zero field .",
    "the magnon binding energy is also evaluated as @xmath74 for @xmath70 and @xmath75 for @xmath72 at @xmath65  @xcite . therefore , when we apply the formula  ( [ eq : nmr_boso ] ) at this point , temperature must be low enough , say , @xmath76 .",
    "we also note that the numerical estimates of @xmath57 in the present calculation are subject to a rather large finite - size effect and the evaluated @xmath3 is less accurate than that of the quadrupolar liquid in ref .",
    "however , we have checked that the result below is stable and semi - quantitatively unchanged against such an error of @xmath57 .     in the octupolar tl - liquid phase for @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "we simply set the coupling constant @xmath77 . ]",
    "( [ eq : nmr_boso ] ) ] in the octupolar tl - liquid phase for @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) and @xmath78 . ]",
    "( [ eq : nmr_boso ] ) ] in the octupolar tl - liquid phase for @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) and @xmath78 . ]",
    "we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : temperature ] the temperature dependence of @xmath3 .",
    "the result confirms the previous prediction that , as temperature decreases , @xmath3 increases divergently for the low - field regime ( @xmath79 ) and decreases for the high - field regime ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : field ] shows the field dependence of @xmath3 for several fixed temperatures .",
    "it is remarkable that , for the sufficiently low temperature @xmath81 , @xmath3 decreases with increasing @xmath10 ( or @xmath58 ) except for the vicinity of the saturation field .",
    "the contribution from each term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nmr_boso ] ) is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : each - comp ] separately .",
    "it is clear that the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nmr_boso ] ) proportional to @xmath82 contributes dominantly to a peculiar behavior of @xmath3 , decrease with increasing @xmath10 , for a wide field range .",
    "this feature becomes less significant as temperature increases and the field dependence of @xmath3 becomes nearly flat for a rather high temperature , @xmath83 .",
    "the @xmath84 and @xmath10 dependence of @xmath3 found above is qualitatively the same as that of the quadrupolar tl liquid  @xcite , as expected . even in the neighboring hexadecapolar liquid phase , similar properties",
    "must be realized ( although the formula  ( [ eq : nmr_boso ] ) would be valid only in extremely low temperature regime ) .",
    "quasi-1d @xmath1-@xmath2 magnets with high crystallographic symmetry often have principal axes for hyperfine coupling tensor .",
    "for such a case , we can eliminate all the contributions from the longitudinal spin correlations , i.e. , @xmath64 terms , in @xmath3 , setting the field @xmath10 parallel to a principal axis . as a result ,",
    "thermal activated contribution @xmath55 proportional to @xmath85 , which is the hallmark of the multipolar liquids , becomes detectable in @xmath3 . in this case , therefore , we can easily distinguish the multipolar tl liquid and usual tl liquid phases from temperature dependence of @xmath3 .",
    "we have studied the nmr relaxation rate @xmath3 in field - induced octupolar tl liquid of the spin-@xmath0 @xmath1-@xmath2 chain . substituting numerical estimates of parameters @xmath33 , @xmath50 , and @xmath57 into the field - theoretical result ,",
    "we have evaluated @xmath3 as a function of temperature and magnetic field .",
    "we have then found that , similarly in the quadrupolar liquid , @xmath3 in the octupolar tl liquid also exhibits characteristic features which are qualitatively different from those in the usual tl liquid ; in the octupolar liquid , ( i ) @xmath3 decreases ( increases ) with increasing temperature @xmath84 for the low- ( high-)field regime , and ( ii ) for sufficiently low temperatures , @xmath3 decreases with increasing magnetic field @xmath10 for a wide field range except the vicinity of the saturation field .",
    "these features can be understood from the absence of the quasi - long - range order in the transverse - spin correlation , which is a natural consequence of the formation of magnon bound states , and therefore be generally expected in all the multipolar tl liquids in @xmath1-@xmath2 chain .",
    "we note that the above features of @xmath3 in the octupolar phase is observed only in sufficiently low temperature regime ( @xmath86 at @xmath65 ) .",
    "this is a quantitative difference from the case of the quadrupolar phase , which has relatively small @xmath16 .",
    "the result in this paper indicates that nmr relaxation rate @xmath3 could be useful to detect a signature of the multipolar tl - liquid phases .",
    "however , only the temperature dependence of @xmath3 can not be a sufficient evidence for them .",
    "for instance , @xmath3 also decreases with lowering temperature in high - field spin - gapped states such as magnetization plateaus .",
    "therefore , we propose that observations of both characteristic behavior in @xmath3 and gapless behavior of bulk quantities ( specific heat , susceptibilities , etc . ) present an indirect but strong evidence for multipolar tl liquids .",
    "it has been reported  @xcite that three quasi-1d cuprates @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 have relatively large value of @xmath16 ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "we expect that our result will be helpful for searching for the appearance of octupolar phase in these compounds under high magnetic field .",
