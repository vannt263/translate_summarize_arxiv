    "chiral symmetry , reflecting the qcd dynamics at low energies , has played a crucial role in the description of the hadron interactions .",
    "originally developed for the interaction of pseudoscalar mesons @xcite and of the meson nucleon system @xcite , the need to incorporate vector mesons into the framework gave rise to the local hidden gauge approach @xcite , which incorporates the information of the chiral lagrangians of @xcite and extends it to accommodate the vector interaction with pseudoscalars and with themselves .",
    "another important step to understand the dynamics of hadrons at low and intermediate energies was given by incorporating elements of nonperturbative physics , restoring two body unitarity in coupled channels , which gave rise to the chiral unitary approach , that has been instrumental in explaining many properties of hadronic resonances , mesonic @xcite and baryonic @xcite .",
    "concerning the interaction of vector mesons in this unitary approach , the first work was done in @xcite , where surprisingly the @xmath12 resonances appeared as a consequence of the interaction of @xmath13 mesons from the solution of the bethe salpeter equation with the potential generated from the local hidden gauge lagrangians @xcite .",
    "the generalization to su(3 ) of that work was done in @xcite and further resonances came from this approach , the @xmath14 among others .",
    "most of these findings were confirmed in the su(6 ) spin - flavor symmetry scheme followed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the step to incorporate charm in the local hidden gauge approach of refs .",
    "@xcite was given in @xcite , and the interaction of @xmath13 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 was studied extrapolating to the charm sector the local hidden gauge approach .",
    "three @xmath17 states with spin @xmath18 were obtained , the second one identified with the @xmath19 and the last one with the @xmath20 .",
    "the first state , with @xmath21 , was predicted at @xmath22 mev with a width of about 100 mev .",
    "this state is also in agreement with the @xmath23 , with a similar width , reported after the theoretical work in @xcite .",
    "the properties of these resonances are well described by the theoretical approach .",
    "the success in the predictions of this theoretical framework in the light and the charm sectors suggests to give the step to the bottom sector and make predictions at this early stage .",
    "the extension is straightforward , because the interaction in the local hidden gauge approach is provided by the exchange of vector mesons .",
    "the exchange of light vectors is identical to the case of the @xmath24 interaction , since the @xmath25 or @xmath26 quarks act as spectators . in the exchange of heavy vectors , the form and the coefficients",
    "are also the same , since the @xmath27 meson can be obtained from the @xmath17 simply replacing the @xmath25 quark by the @xmath26 quark .",
    "however , instead of exchanging a @xmath16 in the subdominant terms , one exchanges now a @xmath1 meson .",
    "these terms are anyway subdominant .",
    "hence , it is not surprising that the predictions that we obtain in this work in the @xmath28 sector are very similar to those obtained in @xcite in the @xmath17 sector .",
    "we shall also discuss the heavy quark spin symmetry ( hqss ) , which we show is satisfied by the dominant terms of the interaction , and then discuss the behaviour of the hqss breaking terms subdominant hqss breaking terms .",
    "we make predictions for three states from the @xmath29 interaction and compare with available experimental states .    in a similar way",
    ", we also deal with the interaction of @xmath7 in s - wave , which gives rise to a state of @xmath30 which we can identify with a state already existing .",
    "this interaction follows also from the local hidden gauge approach , although equivalent chiral lagrangians have been used in the light sector @xcite and in the @xmath17 sector @xcite , where also qcd sum rules have been investigated @xcite .",
    "we are going to use the local hidden gauge approach where the interaction is given mainly by the exchange of vector mesons .",
    "we follow closely the approach of @xcite and with minimal changes we can obtain most of the equations .",
    "we take the vector - vector interaction from @xcite as @xmath31 where the symbol @xmath32 represents the trace in su(4 ) flavor space ( we consider @xmath33 and @xmath26 quarks ) , with @xmath34\\ ] ] and @xmath35 standing for the vector representation of the different @xmath36 pairs , and the coupling @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 with the pion decay constant @xmath39 mev , and @xmath40 mev .",
    "the local hidden gauge lagrangians also contains a four vector contact term @xmath41 which in the @xmath42 channel gives rise to the term depicted in fig .",
    "[ contact](a ) .     +     + from eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) we also get a three vector interaction term @xmath43 this latter lagrangian gives rise to a @xmath44 interaction term through the exchange of a virtual vector meson , as depicted in figs .",
    "[ contact](b ) and [ contact](c ) . as in @xcite",
    "we also assume that the three momenta of the particles are small compared to the vector masses .",
    "this helps to simplify the formalism .",
    "we consider the @xmath45 states @xmath46 where we use the phase convention",
    "where the isospin doublets are @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and the rho triplet is @xmath51 .",
    "the contact terms are all of the type @xmath52 where @xmath53 are the polarization vectors of the vector mesons in the order 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , where these indices are used in the reaction @xmath54 .",
    "analoguosly , the terms associated to vector exchange of the type of fig .",
    "[ contact](b ) are particularly easy , since , neglecting the external three momenta , these terms are of the type @xmath55 then we can separate these terms into the different contribution of spin ( we work only with angular momentum @xmath56 ) which are given by @xcite @xmath57 we can see that , while the contact terms give rise to different combinations of spin , the vector exchange term of type of fig .",
    "[ contact](b ) , contains the sum @xmath58 , with equal weights for the different spins .",
    "this combination , corresponding to the exchange of a light vector meson ( @xmath13 , @xmath15 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) if allowed , satisfies hqss to which we shall come back later on . on the other hand",
    ", the exchange of a heavy vector meson contains the combination @xmath61 and does not satisfy leading order hqss constraints , as we shall see in sect .",
    "[ subsection : results - rho - b*-system ] .",
    "this goes in line with hqss , since the exchange of heavy vectors is penalized versus the exchange of light ones by a factor @xmath62 from the propagators and become subdominant .",
    "the contact term is also subdominant since it goes like @xmath63 of the dominant term from the exchange of a light vector .",
    "hqss is satisfied only for the dominant term in the @xmath64 counting , as it should be .      [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     finally we have investigated if there is some aspect in the interaction which can be related to the heaviness of the system under consideration .",
    "the fact that the @xmath28 mesons have a large mass can justify the study of the @xmath7 and @xmath42 systems under the frame of heavy quark spin symmetry .",
    "we have splitted these states in terms of eigenstates of total angular momentum of the light quarks as in @xcite .",
    "we find that the dominant terms in our approach , due to light vector exchange , which go like @xmath65 fulfill the lo constrains of hqss , while the contact terms and those coming from the exchange of @xmath1 are subdominant ( @xmath65 ) and do not fulfill the lo hqss rules . while in the @xmath66 sector these terms were not too small , in the present case they are much smaller and we have a near degeneracy in the @xmath42 states with @xmath18 .",
