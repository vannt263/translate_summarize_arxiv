    "the reentrance of the superconductivity in quasi - one - dimensional electrons in strong magnetic field attracts theoretical interest @xcite . in the quasi - one - dimensional systems",
    "the fermi surface is open and landau level quantization does not exist .",
    "@xcite has shown that the superconducting transition temperature reaches to that in the absence of the magnetic field as the magnetic field is increased .",
    "dupuis et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that there exists the cascade of the superconducting phases separated by first order transitions .",
    "the reentrance of the superconductivity is understood as follows . when the strong magnetic field is applied along the @xmath0 axis",
    ", the semi - classical orbits of electrons are localized in the @xmath1-@xmath0 plane , where @xmath1 is the most conducting axis , i.e. the motion along the @xmath2 axis is bounded .",
    "since the orbital frustration due to the magnetic field comes from the motion of electrons in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field , electrons can make cooper pairs without affected by the orbital frustration and the transition temperature increases .",
    "the reentrance of the superconductivity in two - dimensional electrons in strong magnetic field also attracts theoretical interest @xcite .",
    "this phenomena is similar to that in quasi - one - dimensional systems , but the origin for the reentrance of the superconductivity in two - dimension is different from that in quasi - one - dimension . in two - dimensional case cooper pairs in strong magnetic field are formed between electrons at the lowest landau level , whereas superconductivity is stabilized in magnetic field without landau level quantization in quasi - one - dimensional system .",
    "quasi - one - dimensional electrons are realized in organic conductors , ( tmtsf)@xmath3x , where anion x is pf@xmath4 , clo@xmath5 etc .",
    "the system can be described as the anisotropic tight - binding model with the hopping matrix elements , @xmath6ev , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . due to the smallness of @xmath9 , the magnetic field necessary to the reentrance of the superconductivity",
    "is estimated to be about 20 t @xcite , which can be realized in experiments .",
    "the superconductivity in the quasi - one - dimensional organics , ( tmtsf)@xmath3x , is thought to be not the conventional bcs type even in the absence of magnetic field . when the nesting condition of the fermi surface is satisfied sufficiently , which is thought to be the case at low pressure , the quasi - one - dimensional organic conductors are not superconductors but insulators due to spin density wave ( sdw ) .",
    "since sdw is caused by the on - site coulomb repulsion , the on - site repulsion is expected to be large in this system . as a result the conventional s - wave spin - singlet superconductivity is not likely to be stabilized .",
    "indeed , the nmr relaxation rate , @xmath10 of the ( tmtsf)@xmath3clo@xmath5 shows little enhancement just below the transition temperature and it decreases as @xmath11 as temperature becomes low , which strongly suggests the line nodes of the energy gap in the superconducting state @xcite .",
    "the line nodes in the superconducting states are caused by the attractive interaction between electrons which are not on the same site .",
    "when the magnetic field is applied along the @xmath12 direction , the @xmath13 dependence of the interaction is not affected by the magnetic field .",
    "thus if the attractive interaction depends only on @xmath13 , the magnetic field dependence of the superconducting transition temperature is the same as that in the case of the on - site attraction .",
    "however , the @xmath14 dependence of the interaction makes the different field dependence . in the quasi - one dimensional case",
    "the @xmath15 dependence of the interaction is not very important because fermi surface consists of two planes , @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , in this paper we assume the attractive interaction between electrons in the nearest chains in @xmath17 direction , which results in the line node of the energy gap in the superconducting state .    in the previous paper one of the authors",
    "has shown that if the magnetic field is applied , the quasi - one - dimensional electrons in the perpendicular plane is described as the one - dimensional system and the effective interaction depends on the magnetic field and the transverse component of the wave vector @xcite . when the magnetic field is applied along the @xmath2 axis",
    ", the perfect nesting is recovered as long as we neglect the small imperfectness of the order of @xmath18 . in that paper",
    "the on - site repulsive interaction is assumed and the field - induced spin density wave ( fisdw ) is studied . the quantum hall effect in fisdw",
    "is understood as a result of the @xmath13-dependent phase of the effective interaction .",
    "in this paper we apply the same procedure to the case of the coexistence of the on - site repulsion and the nearest - site attraction .",
    "when the magnetic field is applied in the @xmath12 direction , the imperfectness of the nesting of the fermi surface is not changed and fisdw is not stabilized . in that case",
    "the superconductivity is caused by the attractive part of the interaction .",
    "we study the quasi - one - dimensional electrons in the magnetic field . for simplicity ,",
    "we take @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath2 axes to be perpendicular each other and to be along the @xmath19 , @xmath12 and @xmath17 directions , respectively .",
    "the generalization to the non - orthogonal lattice can be performed as in the fisdw case @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are creation and annihilation operators of electrons , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath9 are the hopping matrix elements along the @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath2 axes , respectively , @xmath25 is the interaction between electrons at @xmath26 and @xmath27 sites and @xmath28 in the above @xmath29 is the vector potential and @xmath30 is the flux quantum , where @xmath31 is the light velocity .",
    "we consider the anisotropic system with the hopping matrix elements @xmath32 , which is the case in ( tmtsf)@xmath3x .",
    "the nesting of the fermi surface is not perfect due to the @xmath24 term .    in eq.([hamiltonian ] ) we have neglected the zeeman term for simplicity . the zeeman term does not play any important role for the equal - spin - pairing case of the spin triplet . if the zeeman energy is taken into account , the transition temperature of the spin singlet is reduced but the superconductivity is not completely destroyed , since half of the density of states is available to make cooper pairs for the larkin - ovchinikov - frude - ferrell state @xcite .",
    "therefore , the effect of the zeeman energy for the spin singlet can be taken into account by putting the density of states to be half in the strong magnetic field .    in this paper",
    "the magnetic field @xmath33 is applied in the @xmath12 direction and the vector potential @xmath29 is taken as @xmath34 then the non - interacting hamiltonian is written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 - \\cos ( a k_f ) \\ }          -2 t_b \\cos ( b k_y ) ,   \\\\",

    "we consider the case that the system has the open fermi surface and the magnetic field is not very strong in the sense that the magnetic flux per plaquette is much smaller than the flux quantum .",
    "then we get @xmath38 and we can treat the electrons with @xmath39 and @xmath40 independently in @xmath41 as linear combinations of the eigenstates @xmath42 and @xmath43 as @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are integers .    in this paper",

    "we consider the particle - particle channel , which corresponds to the instability toward the superconductivity in the case of the attractive interaction .    with the eigenstates @xmath56 and @xmath57 the interaction hamiltonian",

    "the eigenvalues are obtained as @xmath64 and the eigenstates are given with the coefficients @xmath65 and @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the bessel function and @xmath68 .",
