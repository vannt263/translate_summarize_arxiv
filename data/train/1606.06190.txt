    "the problem of determining essential self - adjointness of smooth coefficient first - order differential operators , as well as their powers , is an important and well studied topic .",
    "this paper considers similar problems but in the context of non - smooth coefficients .",
    "more precisely , we consider first - order symmetric differential operators @xmath0 , as well as their powers , on smooth vector bundles @xmath1 , over smooth , noncompact manifolds @xmath2 .",
    "we allow for the coefficients of the operator as well as the metrics on the bundle and the manifold to be non - smooth .",
    "our primary focus is to understand the relationship between the regularity of the coefficients of @xmath0 and the essential self - adjointness of powers of @xmath0 .",
    "there is a plethora of historical literature surrounding this subject , and therefore , we confine ourselves to presenting only the relevant references to our work .",
    "from our point of view , it was gaffney who in @xcite made a first significant contribution by establishing the essential self - adjointness of the hodge - laplacian @xmath3 under a so - called _ negligible boundary _ condition",
    ". moreover , gaffney allows his manifold to be @xmath4 and incomplete .",
    "the next relevant reference to us is the work of wolf in @xcite , where he studies the essential self - adjointness of general dirac operators and their squares .",
    "moreover , cordes in @xcite obtains the essential self - adjointness of all powers of the laplace - beltrami operator @xmath5 on functions .",
    "later , in @xcite , chernoff studies conditions under which essential self - adjointness of _ all _ powers of first - order operators are obtained .",
    "these last three references assume both completeness and smoothness of their metrics and the coefficients of the operators .",
    "the study we present here is in part motivated by an attempt to recover results similar to that of @xcite and @xcite but without assuming smoothness of the operator and the metric . a priori , our differential operator @xmath6 , and such operators can arise , for instance , as operators built from levi - civita connections associated to lipschitz metrics . under a set of mild assumptions [ d : first]-[d : last ] , we proceed by demonstrating that the essential self - adjointness of this operator is equivalent to the _ negligible boundary _ property formulated with respect to the operator @xmath0 ( see definition [ def : negbdy ] ) .",
    "this property is trivially satisfied on compact manifolds and hence , our analysis is exclusively carried out in the non - compact setting .",
    "if the differential operator has @xmath7-coefficients , then for @xmath8 , we demonstrate that the essential self - adjointness of @xmath9 is equivalent to this aforementioned property for the operator @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , we do not expect essential self - adjointness , in general , to survive for orders @xmath10 for a @xmath7-coefficient operator .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that , even for an arbitrary smooth compactly supported @xmath11 , @xmath12 exists only distributionally .    in  [ s : essneg ] , we demonstrate this equivalence under the mild set of assumptions [ d : first]-[d : last ] , primarily motivated by features we would expect from elliptic operators .",
    "we emphasise that in demonstrating this equivalence , we do not make any assumptions about the completeness of the underlying space .",
    "we proceed abstractly in order to emphasise this point , and in fact , carry out this analysis on spaces with so - called _ rough metrics_. these are riemannian - like metrics that have merely measurable coefficients , which are comparable against induced euclidean metrics in small enough charts . a priori , such",
    "a metric only induces a well defined measure , and it is unknown whether there is a naturally associated notion of length .",
    "the significance of the negligible boundary criterion is that it can still be formulated on this measure space without alluding to a length structure .    in  [",
    "s : htol ] , at this same level of generality , we are also able to show that if @xmath9 is essentially self - adjoint , then so are its lower powers .",
    "this is done via functional calculus and operator theoretic methods to emphasise the fact that this assertion makes no geometric demands .",
    "geometry begins to play a significant role when attempting to boost essential self - adjointness from lower to higher powers .",
    "we carry out this study in  [ s : ess ] , and the way in which we do this is to establish the negligible boundary condition for higher powers via a bootstrapping procedure . here , we are forced to assume completeness , but we are able to allow for a restricted class of rough metrics that induce a length space .",
    "this is still a large and significant class of non - trivial metrics which , for instance , include bi - lipschitz pullbacks of smooth , complete metrics .",
    "we emphasise that it is the lack of regularity that forces us away from the wave technique in @xcite or the pde technique in @xcite , as these techniques seem to require smoothness in a crucial way . by generalising the ideas of @xcite",
    ", we demonstrate a certain elliptic estimate for lower powers of our operator from knowing that the higher powers have finite @xmath13-energy .",
    "this in turn allows us to obtain negligible boundary for higher powers via the first power .",
    "in  [ s : app ] , we consider applications to dirac and other elliptic differential operators .",
    "as a first consequence , we highlight the following result for spin manifolds with non - smooth metrics .",

    "the first part of this theorem , the essential self - adjointness of @xmath19 for lipschitz metrics , was obtained by bandara , mcintosh and rosn  in @xcite by other methods , and was a guiding motivation for our work here . moreover , theorem [ thm : main2 ] is a particular instance of more general results we obtain for dirac operators on general dirac bundles .    as a second highlight theorem , we present the following consequence of our work to general symmetric elliptic operators .",

    "the above proposition [ dir_est ] implies that @xmath631 .",
    "furthermore , theorem [ d_essen_self ] implies that @xmath0 satisfies the negligible boundary condition on @xmath2 . therefore ,",
    "if we take @xmath632 we have @xmath633 which is the negligible boundary condition for @xmath210 . from theorem [ thm : firstmain ]",

    ". we will give the details for the case @xmath642 , which involves some slight modifications of the above @xmath166 case , and then we will show how to do the general case via induction .",

    "we obtain @xmath657      we now want to plug in our local estimate for the @xmath661 term occurring on the right .",
    "we remind the reader that at first sight this seems impossible . in obtaining a local estimate for @xmath662 we assumed @xmath601 , and",
    "our hypothesis at this point is that @xmath643 .",
    "however , we do not know , a priori , that @xmath601 and in fact , this is what we will prove when we obtain the associated _ global _ estimate .",
    "however , as we observed in remark [ rem_dir_est ] , we actually do not require @xmath11 to be in @xmath663 for the _ local _ estimate .",
    "it suffices to ask that @xmath11 be smooth .",
    "thus , on substituting the local estimate into the above inequality , we obtain : @xmath664 we can re - write this to give @xmath665 where we remind the reader that @xmath666 .",
    "we are now left with showing that we can choose @xmath557 and @xmath645 sufficiently large so that the coefficients in the estimate are positive .",
    "it is easy to see that for large @xmath557 we have @xmath667 .",
    "we take @xmath668 , where @xmath669 is a parameter , and observe that by taking @xmath557 and @xmath669 sufficiently large , we can make the coefficient @xmath670 on the left hand side positive .",
    "this finishes the proof .",
    "observe that if we take @xmath586 , we have that @xmath671 , and @xmath672 .",
    "so by choosing @xmath645 appropriately , @xmath673 can always be made greater than zero .",

    "therefore , if we take @xmath680 then @xmath681 which is the negligible boundary condition for @xmath679 .",
    "it follows from theorem [ thm : firstmain ] that @xmath679 is essentially self - adjoint .    the general case of proving essential self - adjointness of @xmath599 proceeds along similar lines . in obtaining a local estimate for @xmath682",
    ", we will meet constants of the form @xmath683 that will depend on a given set of positive numbers @xmath684 , and constants @xmath685 that arise from the local estimate for @xmath686 .",
    "the goal will be to show that we can pick these constants to be positive , by making a suitable choice for @xmath687 .",
    "for example , in the case of obtaining a local estimate for @xmath678 in terms of @xmath688 and @xmath11 , the constant @xmath689 takes the form @xmath690 where we remind the reader that @xmath691 and @xmath666 .",
    "the type of question we will be faced with is : given @xmath692 can we choose @xmath693 so that @xmath694 for @xmath695 ?",
    "the idea would be to choose @xmath557 and @xmath696 sufficiently large so that @xmath697 .",
    "the problem is that as we vary @xmath696 the constant @xmath670 also changes , so there is a non triviality that we need to prove .",
    "the way in which we proceed is to generalise the argument demonstrating how @xmath670 can be made positive .",
    "we define @xmath698 , where @xmath699 is a parameter to be chosen later .",
    "we then define @xmath700 , and substitute these into the formulas for @xmath670 and @xmath701 to obtain @xmath702 in the above formula for @xmath701 , we can see that the @xmath703 term does not depend on @xmath699 .",
    "therefore , we start by choosing @xmath557 sufficiently large so that @xmath667",
    ". then we choose @xmath669 and @xmath557 sufficiently large so that @xmath704 , and finally choose @xmath699 and @xmath557 sufficiently large so that @xmath697 .",
    "we will prove this by induction .",
    "we have already seen that it is true for the @xmath717 case ( and in fact the @xmath718 case ) .",
    "so assume it is true for all @xmath719 , we will prove it is true for @xmath720 .    the formula for @xmath721",
    "is given by @xmath722 we observe that if we insert @xmath709 into the @xmath723-th position for @xmath724 , we only affect the @xmath725 in the above formula for @xmath721 .",
    "our induction hypothesis tells us that this term can be made independent of @xmath726 .",
    "if we then substitute @xmath727 into the @xmath728-th position , we see that we do not affect the @xmath725 term , because this has been made independent of @xmath729 , and then we see that we get rid of the @xmath730 dependence arising in the other terms . in particular , it follows that @xmath731 is independent of @xmath732 , and this establishes that @xmath721 satisfies the first condition .    for the second condition , we observe that @xmath731 is given by @xmath733 our induction hypothesis allows us to choose @xmath734 , and @xmath557 sufficiently large so that @xmath694 for @xmath719 .",
    "furthermore , the first condition of the induction hypothesis implies that the constant @xmath735 does not depend on @xmath729 , which in turn allows us to conclude that @xmath736 does not depend on @xmath737 .",
    "therefore , by taking @xmath737 and @xmath557 sufficiently large we can make it so that @xmath738 this establishes the second condition for @xmath721 .",
    "it follows by induction that it is true for all @xmath706 .    as for the last statement",
    ", simply observe that if we are given positive numbers @xmath714 we can substitute @xmath739 into the @xmath723-th position for @xmath710 . by condition ( ii ) we can then choose @xmath740 , and @xmath557 sufficiently large so that @xmath694 .",
    "we will prove this by induction , the @xmath642 case being done in proposition [ dir^2_loc_prop ] .",
    "so assume the proposition is true for @xmath745 .",
    "this means that for @xmath525 , given any @xmath746 we can choose positive @xmath747 sufficiently large so that @xmath694 for @xmath748 , and so that @xmath749 it should be noted , as we observed in remark [ rem_dir_est ] , that such an estimate holds merely for @xmath152 .",
    "when we substitute this estimate into the derived estimate for @xmath682 we will use this fact without explicit mention .    by lemma [ constants ] , we can choose @xmath750 and @xmath557 sufficiently large so that @xmath694 for @xmath743 .",
    "furthermore , in the proof of that lemma , we showed how we could choose @xmath750 so that the @xmath751 would not depend on @xmath729 .",
    "in particular , this means that for these @xmath694 for @xmath752 the above estimate for @xmath686 holds with all the @xmath694 .",
    "therefore , all that we need to do is show that the above estimate holds .    to obtain an estimate for @xmath682 we start by estimating @xmath753 .",
    "we begin by fixing a smooth compactly supported function @xmath611 such that @xmath612 on @xmath613 and @xmath611 vanishing outside of @xmath614 .",
    "we then have that @xmath754 where the second equality follows from proposition [ lip_sym ] .      using cauchy - schwarz , the bound , and the fact that @xmath757 does not have any zeros in @xmath570",
    ", we have @xmath758 similarly we have @xmath759 these two bounds imply @xmath760 we now substitute the estimate for @xmath761 , as given in the induction hypothesis , to obtain @xmath762 this can be re - written as @xmath763 by definition , the coefficient on the left hand side is precisely @xmath721 , and so we have established the estimate for @xmath682 .",
    "the local estimates we obtain , from the above proposition , can be promoted to a global estimate by taking @xmath764 .",
    "all we have to note is that we have explicit formulas for the constants .",
    "we know that @xmath666 , and in general @xmath765 therefore , it follows that as @xmath586 we have that @xmath671 , and in general @xmath766    one can then prove an analogous result to lemma [ constants ] for the @xmath767 .",
    "we will not do this as the proof is exactly the same as the proof of lemma [ constants ] .",
    "using this fact , and taking @xmath586 in the local estimate in proposition [ dir^k_loc ] , we obtain the following theorem .        the above theorem shows us that @xmath774 for @xmath161 .",
    "fixing @xmath775 , we have using theorem [ d_essen_self ] that @xmath776 this implies that @xmath28 satisfies the negligible boundary condition for @xmath777 and the conclusion follows from theorem [ thm : firstmain ] .",
