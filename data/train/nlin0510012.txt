    "we propose and study a method for a multi - agent system of autonomous vehicles to perform the exploration of a non - stationary environment .",
    "the goal of this exploration is to reach a designated target geometry , typically a boundary , and to describe that boundary .",
    "the current paper relates to the general objective of studying motions of swarms , which we understand as a collection of autonomous entities which rely on local sensing and simple behavior , interacting in a way that a more complex behavior of the whole group emerges from local interactions @xcite .",
    "this type of behavior is well - known in natural phenomena such as schools of fish @xcite and colonies of insects @xcite .",
    "one can find in the literature various other methods of simulating motions of distributed systems inspired by biology @xcite , @xcite , and by economics - based concepts @xcite .",
    "the applications of such motions are quite broad since substituting agents for humans is desirable in many areas such as de - mining operations @xcite , mapping and exploration @xcite , navigation control @xcite , formation flying @xcite and military planning @xcite .",
    "the algorithm presented here models a group of agents to move on a given surface or within a prescribed volume , find its boundary and track it , while communicating with each other and spreading simultaneously over the surface .",
    "the environment in which the motion takes place varies in time .",
    "such a method may provide insight to a better understanding of motions of swarms in biology @xcite .",
    "the motion of swarms in military applications has been considered in recent years @xcite , since it offers an unmanned , dependable , flexible , self - organized type of network to achieve various military objectives , while replacing the burden of comprehensive communication , since the swarms interact primarily with their neighbors .",
    "the particular goal of identifying and tracking the boundary of a surface which we address here , is analogous to the problem encountered in image segmentation of tracing the boundary of an object .",
    "tracking contours as a function of time has been addressed in the pioneer work of kass @xcite , in relation to localizing features in an image .",
    "here we add more complexity to the situation in @xcite since the motion of the agents starts far away from the boundary .",
    "moreover , once the boundary is located the contour of agents moves along that boundary rather than keeping a fixed location .",
    "the idea of adapting image processing techniques to simulate motions of swarms was proposed in @xcite , where the image segmentation technique of locating a contour with a model known as a snake @xcite , or energy - minimizing curve , @xcite is adopted .",
    "we extent that analogy by allowing the formation of agents to move on a time - dependent surface or on a surface whose boundary travels in time . in the current work",
    "we explore the problem of simulating the motion of agents which effectively locate and follow the boundary of a surface of interest , assuming that the boundary is known to each agent and it is moving in time possibly along with the entire surface .",
    "the motion of agents takes place in either 2d or 3d .",
    "the idea of the algorithm we present is to model the group of agents as a contour that deforms towards the boundary of the object .",
    "interactions between nearby agents are assumed , the modeling of these interactions being analogous to having forces acting between nearby particles as in an elastic band .",
    "an energy functional results from this physical model in a continuum limit .",
    "the desired motion of the agents is obtained by minimizing this functional to which an appropriate goal dynamics term is added , so that its minimum is obtained as the agents land on the proposed target .",
    "the algorithm assumes that each agent has the position of the boundary , has information on nearby agents , and evaluates its position on the surface as well as the local gradient of that surface .",
    "the movement of each agent can be modeled by a partial differential equation for the velocity of each vehicle . by discretizing this equation",
    "we derive a numerical scheme for the motion of each agent .",
    "each equation contains a term accounting for movement along the steepest descent on the surface and a term corresponding to movement parallel to the tangent to the boundary that is being tracked .",
    "coordinated behavior is created by imposing local interaction rules among agents .",
    "these terms also dictate the manner in which the formation will converge towards the desired goal .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we present an algorithm for an individual agent to accomplish the desired task",
    ". then we continue in section iii with adding a sparsing term which connects the motions of nearby swarmers and prevents collisions of agents in real applications .",
    "obtaining collective motion local communication rules is essential .",
    "typically these rules determine a general pattern of significance in applications @xcite .",
    "consequently in section iii we present a pde model that includes interaction between nearby swarmers .",
    "these interactions are based on modeling the swarm as the discretization of an elastic string with elastic and bending forces acting between nearby particles . in section",
    "iv we give a numerical method based on the model in the previous section .",
    "we continue in section v with the corresponding algorithm in 3d , which means the motion now takes place on a surface defined in 3d rather then 2d .",
    "we end with a conclusion section .",
    "the simplest version of the algorithm consists in designing motion terms that would lead a single vehicle to move towards a given boundary and then move along that boundary .",
    "the component of the motion that determines the approach to a prescribed boundary consists in moving along the steepest descent direction along a surface . to make the vehicle describe the boundary",
    "we include a term that is parallel to the tangent to the boundary of the surface . the velocity of a vehicle is thus calculated from these two components giving a system of two ordinary differential equations .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the concentration function of the environment at the agent s position @xmath1 . by `` concentration '' , we mean a function which describes any spatially varying variable , such as density , temperature , etc .",
    "let @xmath2 be a function that achieves a minimum at the boundary of the environmental concentration .",
    "let @xmath3 denote the position vector .",
    "the motion according to the rule @xmath4 results in a gradient descent toward a local minimum of the function @xmath5 , therefore towards the curve @xmath6 . also the rule @xmath7 , ( where @xmath8 denotes the normal vector to the boundary of the surface ) results in travel along the boundary of the concentration surface @xmath9 . combining the two terms mentioned above we arrive at the following model :    @xmath10    the parameter @xmath11 in eq .  [",
    "equation : particle system ] determines the speed of the vehicle in the direction of the tangent to the boundary .",
    "following @xcite as a test case , we consider as the concentration function : @xmath12 equation  [ equation : constraint ] is defined on a disk of radius 2 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 for @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 is the concentration on the boundary , so it is obtained from eq .",
    "(  [ confunction ] ) taking @xmath18 and @xmath19 on the boundary of the circle of radius 2.0 centered at the origin . in this way we are targeting a boundary that varies in space .",
    "we solve the eq .",
    "(  [ rateequations ] ) subject to eq .  [ equation : constraint ] by using runge - kutta method in time to obtain the trajectory shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : singleagent ] , where the initial conditions were @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we also show a top - down view of the same trajectory in fig .",
    "[ fig : singleagentflat ] where the level set of the surface are shown as well as the boundary of the surface ( the circle of radius two ) on which the agent moves .    to achieve movement along the boundary",
    "we calculate @xmath17 using eq .",
    "(  [ confunction ] ) for @xmath18 and @xmath19 corresponding to coordinates on the circle of radius 2 where the surface is defined ( any other curve in @xmath22 space could have been considered ) .",
    "the algorithm can be further extended to allow a vehicle to target a boundary which moves in time . in this case , eq .",
    "(  [ rateequations ] ) is used again , the only difference being that @xmath17 is now a function that varies in time as well in space . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tripletrajectory ] we show three nearby trajectories following a boundary which moves in time at a constant speed @xmath23 .",
    "four different instances in time are shown at @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the existence and uniqueness theorem for ordinary differential equations @xcite guarantees that the trajectories of this motion will not intersect . in realistic situations when agents are used , collision among agents can become a concern .",
    "for such a situation we add a sparsing term in eq .",
    "[ rateequations ] meant to repel nearby vehicles @xcite .",
    "this term varies the velocity of a vehicle according to the following equations :    @xmath26    where the repulsion kernel is given by @xmath27 . here",
    "the parameter @xmath28 is a length scale . in",
    "what follows @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "this term is set non - zero only when the distance between vehicles is less than a given cut - off distance @xmath31 ; i.e. , a maximum distance at which the sparsing is active . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sparsing]b ) we show 4 trajectories whose motion is given by the eq .  [ rateequations ] to which the sparsing term in eq .",
    "[ spars ] has been added . for comparison the same trajectories without the sparsing term",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sparsing]a ) .",
    "when sparsing is added , we see the 4 trajectories , shown in different colors , intermingle several times on the surface until smooth trajectories are established .",
    "this differs from the orderly trajectories that can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tripletrajectory ] .",
    "the above algorithm is used when only a few independent vehicles are available .",
    "when a sufficient number of vehicles are available , direct interaction among nearby vehicles can be introduced .",
    "this accounts for communication among vehicles in real situations and for creating desirable patterns of the motion of a swarm , since a swarm motion is essentially defined as creating various overall patterns and behaviors out of local interaction rules . in",
    "what follows the approach will be to view the group of agents as a continuous curve moving and expanding in time . a nice continuum mechanical analogy",
    "occurs when the motion is being thought of as an elastic band that expands and bends aiming to fit around a given boundary @xcite .",
    "this approach will be shown in the next section .",
    "the algorithm we develop is meant to be used by vehicles with sensing capabilities moving through a medium of variable concentration and aimed at detecting a certain object such as the boundary of a surface .",
    "interaction between vehicles can be conceived in various ways leading to a variety of behaviors of the overall swarm . in what follows",
    "we adopt the point of view of considering the group of agents modeled as an elastic object with elastic and bending forces acting between nearby agents @xcite,@xcite . achieving the desired goal amounts to solving a minimization problem .",
    "we summarize the related theory of this approach in this section and give the corresponding numerical discretization in the next section along with numerical examples .",
    "the collective motion is modeled as the motion of a deformable contour which expands and wraps around the boundary , then moves around the boundary .",
    "consequently it will be represented by a mapping :    @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the periodic unit interval .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are assumed since any agents in the swarm are considered to be identical .",
    "the algorithm consists in minimizing a certain functional @xmath34 over a space of admissible deformations @xmath35 .",
    "this functional @xmath36 represents the energy of the contour and has the following form :    @xmath37ds\\label{eq : energy1},\\ ] ] where the subscripts denote differentiation with respect to the lagrangian parameter s which is the arc length , and p is a function of the environmental data .",
    "p also is designed to incorporate the goal dynamics we are interested in ; i.e. the boundary of a surface . the other two terms of the functional @xmath34 account for the mechanical properties of the contour of agents ;",
    "i.e. , elasticity and bending .",
    "the first term makes the contour have stretch and the second term makes the contour bend @xcite .",
    "the choice of the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 determine the elasticity and the rigidity of the contour .",
    "if @xmath40 is a local extremum of @xmath34 it satisfies the associated euler - lagrange equation :    @xmath41    with periodic boundary conditions . as before let @xmath42 .",
    "the relationship between potential functions and desired goals is discussed comprehensively in @xcite and @xcite .    since the collective motion we are designing takes place in time , we approximate the solution of eq .",
    "(  [ euler - lagrange ] ) as the steady state of the following partial differential equation for the contour @xmath40 :    @xmath43    in which the right hand side is the euler - lagrange eq .",
    "[ euler - lagrange ] .",
    "this equation describes how each point on the active contour @xmath40 should move in order to minimize the functional @xmath34 . in the next section",
    "we show how this equation can be discretized and used in numerical examples .",
    "in this section we present an algorithm for collective motion based on the minimization approach presented above .",
    "this algorithm is obtained discretizing eq .",
    "(  [ contour ] ) and considering each spatial discretization point as representing an agent .",
    "thus a group of agents will evolve according to a time - dependent scheme and will move along a virtual contour which is an approximation of the curve @xmath40 solving eq .",

    "we define thus the motion of the mobile agents by a set of coupled odes for the positions of the @xmath49 agents . in what follows",
    "we take @xmath50 and @xmath51 as in @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion given by (  [ eqdiscrete ] ) will evolve agents towards the boundary of the concentration surface .",
    "once on the boundary , movement along the boundary is generated by adding a term parallel to the normal to the surface as in (  [ rateequations ] ) .",
    "this results in the following scheme :    @xmath52    the last term represents the sparsing term that has been added as in eq .  [ spars ] . in the examples below we let @xmath53 and the time derivative in eq .",

    "it follows that one and respectively two - nearest neighbor communication will occur , as seen from the discretization of the diffusion term and the discretization of the 4th order derivative .",
    "stability issues as well an implicit version concerning this algorithm have been discussed in @xcite where it is shown that stability of the forward euler scheme requires the condition @xmath54 , where @xmath55 stands for the distance between nearby agents .",
    "(  [ eqdisc2 ] ) one can effectively target and track a level curve of a concentration surface .",
