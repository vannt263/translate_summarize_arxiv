    "in the standard picture of galaxy formation , galaxy discs form out of gas that slowly cools out of a hot gaseous halo , conserving its specific angular momentum , and forms a disc at the centre of the potential well of a dark matter halo ( white & rees 1978 ; fall & efstathiou 1980 ) . the specific angular momentum of the pre - collapse gas is generally assumed to be equal to that of the dark matter , which is acquired by tidal torques in the early universe ( peebles 1969 ) .",
    "this simple picture leads to predictions of present day disc - galaxies that show reasonably good agreement with observations ( dalcanton , spergel & summers 1997 ; avila - reese , firmani & hernandez ( 1998 ) ; jimenez et al . 1998 ; mo , mao & white 1998 ; de jong & lacey 2000 ; pizagno et al .",
    "2005 ; dutton et al . 2007 ) , however ; later stages of galaxy evolution must certainly include a large variety of processes such as mergers ( naab , jesseit & burkert 2006 ; martig et al .",

    "2012)and accretion of cold gas through thin dense filaments ( kere et al .",
    "2005 ; powell et al .",
    "2011 ) , that shape the morphology of galaxies .",
    "if this complex scenario is actually taking place , it is remarkable to find the presence of fully formed disc galaxies at high redshift that highly resemble present day systems ( genzel et al .",
    "2006 ) , requiring only moderate evolution after a rapid early assembly to reproduce the nearby population of milky way - type galaxies .",
    "observations of disc galaxies at @xmath4 show the existence of large discs , suggesting that these kind of systems must be assembled prior to this epoch ( lilly et al .",
    "1998 ; trujillo & aguerri 2004 ; sargent et al . 2007 ; kanwar et al .",
    "not only do these galaxies have similar sizes to their present day relatives , but they also follow the same scaling relations with none or only mild evolution .",
    "barden et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found weak or no evolution in the stellar - mass@xmath5size relation for disc dominated galaxies back to @xmath6 .",
    "this result is consistent with a passively evolving stellar population at a given mass , with no growth of galaxy disks , or with the idea that in fact the galaxies are growing , but in such a way as to evolve along the same stellar - mass@xmath5size relation .",
    "recently , results pointing in the same direction were reported by ichikawa , kajisawa & akhlaghi ( 2012 ) with a sample extending up to @xmath7 .",
    "similar conclusions are reached by studying other relations , such as the tully - fisher ( tf ) that evolves , specially for the case of blue bands that are highly sensitive to the recent star formation , but presents only mild or no evolution for near infrared bands ( fernndez lorenzo et al .",
    "2010 ) and no evolution at all for the case of the stellar mass tf relation ( miller et al .",
    "high redshift galaxies , up to @xmath8 do not show evidence of evolution in the fundamental plane defined by star formation rate , metallicity and stellar mass ( lara - lpez et al .",
    "in addition , a roughly constant number density of large disc galaxies since @xmath9 ( lilly et al .",
    "1998 ; sargent et al . 2007 ) , and a mass function that does not present strong features of evolution in the same redshift range ( brinchmann & ellis 2000 ) , all indicate that most of the large disc galaxies have experienced little evolution in the last eight billion years .    along with mass , angular momentum shapes fundamental properties of galaxies , and plays a preponderant role in establishing fundamental relations , such as the tf ( koda , sofue & wada 2000 ) . in previous studies * , * we have shown using different samples of galaxies , how the overall morphology of disc galaxies is intimately linked to the galactic angular momentum ( hernandez & cervantes - sodi 2006 ; cervantes - sodi & hernandez 2009 ; cervantes - sodi et al .",
    "2011b ) , and making use of extended samples from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , choi et al . 2010 ) , we have also looked for dependences of the spin parameter on the total mass of the galaxies ( cervantes - sodi et al .",
    "2008 ) and on local and global environment ( cervantes - sodi et al . 2008 ; cervantes - sodi , hernandez & park 2010 ; cervantes - sodi et al .",
    "the aim of this work is to get empirical distributions of the galactic spin for a sample of high redshift galaxies , to look for any evolution on the distributions of this parameter , and compare mass and environment dependencies of the high redshift sample with previous results for local galaxies .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : section 2 gives a brief review of our model to estimate the spin for disc galaxies in the sample , the sample details are described in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we present the general results , with general conclusions appearing in section 5 . throughout , we adopt @xmath10 and a flat @xmath11cdm cosmology with density parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "a traditional way to characterise the galactic angular momentum is through the @xmath14 spin parameter , as defined by peebles ( 1971 ) ;    @xmath15    where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the total energy , mass and angular momentum of the configuration , respectively . in hernandez & cervantes - sodi ( 2006 )",
    ", we derived a simple estimate of total @xmath14 for dark halos hosting disc galaxies in terms of observational parameters , based on two simple hypothesis : that the specific angular momentum of dark matter and baryons are equal , and a constant small baryonic fraction , for systems where the total energy and angular momentum are dominated by the dark matter component .",
    "but serious questions arise about these hypothesis when studying galaxies at high redshift . regarding a constant baryonic fraction ,",
    "a strong dependence on redshift has been suggested ( moster et al .",
    "2010 ; behroozi , conroy & wechsler 2010 ; faucher - gigure , kere & ma 2011 ) , although no clear consensus has been reached , specially for @xmath19 .",
    "notice however , that the lack of evolution of the baryonic tully - fisher relation argues for little evolution of the baryonic galactic fraction .",
    "concerning the first hypothesis , using high - resolution cosmological simulations , several authors claim that the equality at all times for an evolving galaxy is unrealistic ( e. g. dutton & van den bosch 2011 ) , but no general consensus has been reached .",
    "recent studies report a large variety of results , some showing a clear one - to - one correlation between the specific angular momentum of baryons and dark matter ( zavala , okamoto & frenk 2008 ) , while others present analytic expressions in terms of the dark matter fraction ( sales et al .",
    "2009 ) or a combination of virial mass and redshift ( kimm et al .",
    "2011 ) , to establish a relation between the angular momentum of both components .    to avoid complications",
    ", we must therefore use an angular momentum parameter which focuses on the dynamics of the stellar disc .",
    "we retain the quantitative and objective nature of the study , and account for the angular momentum focusing only on the stellar component to define a disc dimensionless angular momentum parameter @xmath0 as we did in cervantes - sodi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) . here",
    "we give a brief account of the model .",
    "we consider a disc for the stellar component of the galaxy with an exponential surface mass density @xmath20 ;    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is a radial coordinate and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are two constants which are allowed to vary from galaxy to galaxy , and assume the presence of a dark matter halo responsible for establishing a rigorously flat rotation curve @xmath25 throughout the disc .    from equation  [ expprof ] ,",
    "the total disc mass is    @xmath26    this , combined with our flat rotational curve , leads to an angular momentum of @xmath27 . assuming the disc to be a virialized dynamical system",
    ", the total energy can be obtained from the total kinetic energy , estimated as arising merely from the dominant rotation . in this case , the kinetic energy of the disc is @xmath28 .",
    "these assumptions allow us to express @xmath0 as    @xmath29    finally , we introduce a stellar tf relation ( miller et al . 2011 ) : @xmath30 , to replace the dependence on @xmath25 for a dependence on the stellar mass available in our sample ( see section 3 ) , to obtain our final estimation of @xmath0 .",
    "note that equation  [ ld ] is the same expression we derived in hernandez & cervantes - sodi ( 2006 ) to estimate the traditional @xmath14 spin parameter for dark matter haloes hosting disc galaxies , divided by the stellar fraction of the galaxy ; this because to obtain the total spin parameter we were assuming angular momentum conservation for both components , and a constant baryonic fraction , linking the specific angular momentum and mass of the dark matter to those quantities of the disc component .",
    "in our current work however , we do not attempt to constrain the physical characteristics of the halo , but just consider its participation in establishing the flat rotation curve throughout the disc .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 is hence not a @xmath14 parameter in the sense of the definition of equation  [ lamdef ] , but merely an estimate of a dimensionless angular momentum for a galactic disc , expected to correlate tightly with all type - defining properties .",
    "the sample of high redshift galaxies used for this study is an updated version of the one presented in hwang & park ( 2009 ) . here , we give a brief description of the sample , and we refer the reader to hwang et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for a detailed description of the data .",
    "we use a spectroscopic sample of galaxies from the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) , which is a deep multiwavelength survey from nasa s great observatories , spitzer , hubble , and chandra , esa s herschel and xmm - newton , and from the most powerful ground - based facilities , with a total observing area approximately 320 arcmin@xmath31 from two carefully selected regions centered on the hubble deep field north ( goods - n ) , and chandra deep field south ( goods - s ) . from the vast spectroscopic data for goods sources in the literature , we used a total number of 6958 galaxies whose spectroscopic redshifts are reliable over the whole fields of goods - n ( cohen et al .",

    "was computed based on the acs plus near - infrared ( nir ) photometry with @xmath36-corrections ( blanton & roweis 2007 ) .",
    "the @xmath37 term was added to @xmath35 for the evolution correction ( wolf et al .",
    "stellar masses are computed from @xmath38-band to irac 4.5 @xmath39 m photometric data using z - peg ( le borgne & rocca - volmerange 2002 ) .",
    "the templates used for the stellar mass estimates are determined from pgase.2 ( fioc & rocca - volmerange 1999 ) assuming a salpeter initial mass function ( salpeter 1955 ) .",
    "the templates were produced using different scenarios for the star formation history ( see le brogne & rocca - volmerange 2002 ) varying the star - formation efficiency and infall timescales , raging from a pure starburst to a continuous star formation rate , lasting from 1 myr to 13 gyr with the requirement for the templates to be younger than the age of the universe at any redshift .",
    "the models include dust computed from pgase.2 , consistently with the star formation histories .",
    "the typical amount of reddening by dust is within the range @xmath40 .",
    "the maximum error associated to the stellar mass estimate is 0.3 dex ( see elbaz et al .",
    "2011 for more details ) .",
    "this estimate of stellar mass is the one used to infer @xmath25 needed in equation  [ ld ] to calculate @xmath0 .",
    "choosing a stellar tf relation has a major advantage over traditional tf relations based on specific bands . as recently reported by several authors ( kassin et al .",
    "2007 , fernndez lorenzo et al .",
    "2010 , miller et al .",
    "2011 ) , the stellar tf seems not to evolve with redshift , at least up to redshift @xmath41 ( miller et al . 2012 ) , and presents the smallest scatter among other tf relations , with intrinsic scatter of 0.058 dex , which is comparable to that seen in local tf relations ( i.e. , @xmath420.049 in pizagno et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "given that our spin estimate is suitable only for disc galaxies , we need to segregate the galaxies in our sample according to their morphology .",
    "to do that , we adopt the segregation criteria by hwang & park ( 2009 ) and hwang et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , where galaxies are classified into early ( e / s0 ) and late ( s / irr ) types by visual inspection .",
    "early - type galaxies are those with little fluctuation in the surface brightness and color and with good symmetry , while late - type galaxies show internal structures and/or color variations in the pseudocolor images . for late - type galaxies we use as a proxy for the scale length @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the half light radius in the @xmath2-band .",
    "in section 4 we will study the dependence of the spin on the environment . to account for the large - scale environment we consider a surface galaxy number density estimated from the five nearest neighbour galaxies ( @xmath45 ) , defined by    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the projected proper distance to the 5th - nearest neighbour , which is identified among the neighbour galaxies with @xmath48 that have velocities relative to the target galaxy less than 1000 km s@xmath49 , so as to exclude foreground and background galaxies .",
    "we will also consider the distance to the nearest neighbour galaxy as a small - scale environmental parameter .",
    "the nearest neighbour galaxy of a target galaxy with absolute magnitude m@xmath50 is the one with the smallest projected separation distance on the sky to the galaxy , is brighter than @xmath51 among those in the sample , with @xmath52 and has relative velocity with respect to the target galaxy less than @xmath53 km s@xmath49 for early - type target galaxies and less than @xmath54 km s@xmath49 for late - type target galaxies .",
    "these velocity difference limits are 10% larger than those that we have used for sdss galaxies in previous studies , i.e. fig 1 of park et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , because of the larger redshift uncertainties for goods galaxies as compared with sdss galaxies .    the virial radius of a galaxy within which the mean mass density is 200 times the critical density of the universe ( @xmath55 ) , is calculated by @xmath56 where @xmath18 is the galaxy luminosity , and @xmath57 the mass - to - light ratio . here , the mass associated with a galaxy plus dark halo system is assumed to be proportional to the @xmath22-band luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "we assume that the mass - to - light ratio of early - type galaxies is on average twice as large as that of late - type galaxies at the same absolute magnitude @xmath35 , which means @xmath57(early)@xmath58(late ) following choi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for sdss galaxies and hwang & park ( 2009 ) for goods galaxies .",
    "the critical density of the universe @xmath59 is a function of redshift @xmath2 [ i.e. @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the mean matter densities in proper and comoving spaces , respectively .",
    "the hubble parameter at @xmath2 is @xmath64 $ ] , where @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 are the dimensionless density parameters at the present epoch ( peebles 1993 ) .",
    "then , the virial radius of a galaxy at redshift @xmath2 in proper space can be rewritten by    @xmath68^{1/3}. \\label{rvir}\\ ] ]    the mean mass density @xmath63 was computed using the galaxies at @xmath69 with various absolute magnitude limits varying from @xmath70 to @xmath71 .",
    "hwang et al . (",
    "2011 ) found that the mean mass density appears to converge when the magnitude cut is fainter than @xmath72 , which means that the contribution of faint galaxies is not significant because of their small masses . in this calculation ,",
    "each galaxy is weighted by the inverse of completeness according to its apparent magnitude and color ( see fig . 1 of hwang & park 2009 ) .",
    "the final values are @xmath73 0.017 and 0.013 @xmath74 ( mpc@xmath75 ) for goods - n and -s , respectively , where @xmath76 is the mass of a late - type galaxy with @xmath77 . according to our formula",
    "the virial radii of galaxies with @xmath77 and @xmath78 are 300 and 400 @xmath79 kpc for early types , and 240 and 320 @xmath79 kpc for late types , respectively .",
    "the final volume limited sample contains 827 late - type galaxies with accurate total stellar masses and reliable spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "once having segregated the galaxies according to their morphology , and with all the information required to apply equation  [ ld ] , we obtained the @xmath0 distribution for all the late type galaxies in our sample .",
    "usually , as is also the case here , this parameter is well described by a log - normal function of the form :    @xmath80 \\frac{d\\lambda_{d}}{\\lambda_{d}}\\ ] ]    the parameters for the best - fitting distribution are @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "to compare directly with global @xmath14-distributions , we need to adopt a recipe to estimate the total angular momentum and mass in terms of stellar parameters .",
    "to do so , we first assume that the specific angular momentum of the disc and the halo are equal ( e.g. , mo et al .",
    "1998 ; zavala et al . 2008 ) ; and then we need to choose a proper dark matter fraction . as in hernandez et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , for a constant dark matter fraction ( f1 ) , the @xmath14-distribution for this sample of high redshift galaxies is compatible with results of low redshift galaxies , with @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the shape of the distribution strongly depends on the assumed dark matter fraction ; just to illustrate this strong dependency we show in fig 1 two other distributions ; one considering a dependence of the dark matter fraction on the stellar surface density ( f2 ) from gnedin et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ,    [ distributions ]    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     .    in cervantes - sodi ,",
    "hernandez & park ( 2010 ) , we found a weak but statistically significant effect of galaxy - galaxy interactions on the @xmath14 value of late - type galaxies .",
    "these appear as soon as the galaxies cross into their virial radii , leading to a gradual decrease in the values of @xmath14 , especially when the neighbour galaxy is a spiral galaxy .",
    "for the galaxies in our sample , we also test the influence of the small - scale environment .",
    "fig 4 upper panel shows @xmath0 as a function of the distance to the nearest neighbour galaxy normalized by the virial radius of the nearest neighbour as computed using equation  [ rvir ] . in this case",
    ", we notice a decrease of the spin only for the most inner bin , but given the small number of galaxies involved , the result is also compatible with no dependence on the distance to the nearest neighbour galaxy . for sdss galaxies",
    "we previous noticed ( see fig 4 in cervantes - sodi et al 2010 ) that the decrease of the spin depends on the morphology of the neighbour galaxy . with this in mind we segregated the galaxies in our high-@xmath2 sample according to the morphology of the neighbour galaxy to search for any difference on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "fig 4 lower panel shows the result , with only a significant difference for the case of @xmath85 , with a decrease of the @xmath0 value for the case of late - type neighbour and an increase for the case of early - type neighbour , a similar behaviour as the one observed with low redshift galaxies , but given the small numbers involved it is difficult to reach a statistically meaningful conclusion at the moment .",
    "using a simple dynamical model , we have obtained empirical @xmath14 distributions of high redshift galaxies in the range @xmath1 that are compatible with results at low redshift .    analysing the angular momentum of the disc component , we did not find traces of evolution as a function of redshift , and we were able to reproduce the relationships of the spin with mass and environment we found previously for local galaxies at all redshifts ; showing a marked dependence of @xmath0 on the mass , with high mass galaxies showing typically low @xmath0 values , as well as lower spread when compared with low mass galaxies ; while there is little if any dependence of @xmath0 on environment , either large or small - scale environmental parameter .",
    "these results lead us to conclude that the spin parameter of disc galaxies suffers negligible evolution if any at all over the last 8 gyr , which is a result in good agreement with theoretical expectations ( peirani , mohayaee & de freitas pacheco 2004 ; kimm et al .",
    "2011 ) , where most of the specific angular momentum is imprinted at early stages ( e.g. white 1984 , barnes & efsthathiou 1987 , catelan & theuns 1996 , pichon et al .",
    "2011 ) , followed by mild evolution , with rare drastic changes appearing only in the case of major mergers ( e. g. peirani et al .",
    "2004 , donghia & navarro 2007 ) . as shown by high - resolution cosmological simulations",
    "( e. g. brook et al .",
    "2012 , governato 2007 ) , a relatively quite merging history also helps to form realistic disc galaxies .",
    "in addition , independent observational results suggest that most disc galaxies are dynamically mature by @xmath86 ( miller et al .",
    "2012 ) in order to reproduce the stellar mass tf relation that is already in place at that redshift .",
    "finally , our results complement previous findings where different groups have shown that the baryonic specific angular momenta of disc galaxies at intermediate ( puech et al . 2007 ; vergani et al . 2012 ) and high redshift ; nearly @xmath87 ( frster schreiber et al . 2006 ) or even @xmath88 ( nesvadba et al . 2006 ) , are comparable to those of local late - type galaxies .",
    "our study thus bridges the gap between local samples and existing @xmath89 results .",
    "the consistent conclusions across all redshift ranges essentially rule out any significant dynamical evolution for large disk galaxies over the last 8 - 10 gyr .",
