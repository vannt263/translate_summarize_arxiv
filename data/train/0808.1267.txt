    "in a recent very interesting paper , dappiaggi , fredenhagen and pinamonti [ 1 ] studied stable cosmological models driven by a free quantum scalar field , under the hypothesis that the underlying algebraic quantum state is of hadamard type [ 2 ] , and showed that , in the massive case , and under certain reasonable assumptions on the solutions of the semiclassical einstein equations , an effective cosmological constant emerges . in order to achieve this",
    ", the authors address the important topic of the most general form of the renormalised stress - energy tensor associated to meaningful semiclassical solutions of the einstein s equations .",
    "in this paper we look at the problem from the point of view of the local quantum field theory ( lqft ) of the casimir effect introduced in [ 3 ] and developped in [ 4 ] and [ 5 ] . as proposed in [ 3 ] ,",
    "measuring the ( renormalised ) hamiltonian density @xmath5 ( see eq . ( 7 ) below ) is a local operation : in order to measure @xmath5 , our measuring apparatus needs only examine a small neighborhood , say @xmath6 , of @xmath7 , whose observable algebra has precisely the same structure as if it were embedded in globally flat space - time , and thus needs no information from global topology .",
    "what does depend on the global structure is the state of the system .",
    "there exists , however , a proviso : how small may @xmath6 be ?",
    "it can not be reduced to the point @xmath7 , because of the local structure of quantum fields , but may , in priciple , be arbitrarily small : on the other hand , the energy density is not bounded below ( as an operator valued distribution ) as @xmath6 contracts to a point [ 6 ] .",
    "this large indeterminacy , further discussed below , is the main subject of our paper .",
    "we work at fixed time ( which may be thought as the cosmic time in applications to general relativity ) and absorb the indeterminacy involved in the choice of @xmath6 in the dimension of a `` small '' region of fixed shape - we take it for simplicity to be a cube of side @xmath8- to which we `` restrict '' a free scalar quantum field by imposing some boundary condition ( b.c . ) .",
    "one might expect that the state of the system be independent of this `` local '' b.c . , but that is not the case .",
    "indeed , as proved in [ 5 ] , only * periodic * b.c . are compatible with lqft for a * scalar * quantum field and , clearly , there is a global change of spatial topology in passing to periodic b.c .. the word `` local '' means , in this special context , that @xmath9    where @xmath10 denotes a characteristic length of the system . in cosmology ,",
    "@xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the hubble length ( see , e.g. , [ 13 ] ) .",
    "we shall come back to ( 1a ) in section iv .",
    "a special issue has acquired special interest in present - day cosmology : are there low - energy states of a scalar quantum field with the properties : a. ) negative pressure ; b. ) the cosmological constant condition @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the pressure and @xmath3 the energy density corresponding to the given state . from a. ) and b. ) there results c. ) @xmath15    the precise significance of ( 1a)-(1c ) and the relation to the cosmological constant is discussed in section iv .",
    "we point out , however , that condition a. ) is independent of the cosmological constant relation b. ) and is a well - known property of dark energy , a model of which is considered as an application of the results of section iii and part of section iv at the end of the latter section ( after ( 36a ) ) .",
    "however , a. ) is included because it is universally true as a well - known intrinsic property of the vacuum state ( [ 9],[10 ] ) and we wish to preserve it for our class of states .    in the models treated so far , such as the free electromagnetic field and the conformally invariant scalar field [ 7 ] enclosed by parallel plates , the energy - momentum tensor was traceless and , due to this condition , dirichlet and neumann b.c .",
    "were bona fide b.c .",
    "( see , also , ref .",
    "[ 5 ] ) . in this typical situation , a. ) was true but not c. ) - the energy density was also negative - so that b. ) was not realized . in both cases the associated quantum field was massless , and",
    "the same happens for a massless scalar quantum field .",
    "we were thus led to study the case of a * massive * quantum scalar field , i.e. , of mass @xmath0 , about which only incomplete results ( with periodic b.c . ) exist [ 8 ] .",
    "this is also the case for which a cosmological constant emerges in the analysis of [ 1 ] .",
    "our result is that a. and b. ) ( and consequently c. ) ) are true for a state consisting of the vacuum and some zero momentum excitations , if the size @xmath8 of the cube is of the order of the compton wave - length of the particle @xmath16 .",
    "this is reasonable because the vacuum and the particles of zero momentum correspond to lowest energy and @xmath4 . on the other hand a. ) and b. ) represent very strong constraints : they prevent , in particular , that @xmath17 , i.e. , that the neighborhood @xmath6 above shrinks to a point .    in the next section",
    "ii we review our definition of the correct energy density operator , which is the basis of all our results .    in section iii we derive the energy density and pressure in closed form for the vacuum state . the result for the pressure involves some remarkable cancellations and is new .",
    "it implies property a. ) .    in section",
    "iv we prove properties b. ) and c. ) for a special state consisting of the vacuum and some excitations ( particles ) of zero momentum .",
    "section v is reserved to the conclusion .",
    "it should be stressed that there exists an immense literature on the casimir effect . in particular ,",
    "zeta function methods have been studied during several decades and are also , in principle , applicable to the problem treated in section iii , see [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] and references given there , in particular , reference [ 10 ] for rigorous results .",
    "applications of the casimir effect to cosmology from a different point of view were made in references [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] and [ 22 ] .",
    "we refer , in particular , to the very nice review of elizalde [ 20 ] and references given there on the dynamical casimir effect . see also refs .",
    "[ 23 ] and [ 24 ] .",
    "we review in this section the conceptual framework , following [ 5 ] , for a rigorous , regularization- independent local quantum field theoretic ( lqft ) treatment of the internal casimir energy and pressure of a cube for a quantum scalar field of mass @xmath0 .",
    "we shall define a * state * of the field , as is common in lqft [ 11 ] , as a positive normalized linear functional @xmath18 such that @xmath19 , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 a bounded observable , and @xmath22 its adjoint .",
    "occasionally , @xmath21 will be taken as an unbounded operator , assuming that @xmath23 is well defined , which will be shown to be the case when @xmath21 is the ( renormalized ) hamiltonian density and @xmath24 a special state .",
    "examples of states are vacuum states and temperature states [ 9 ] , or @xmath25 the fock vacuum state , where @xmath26 is the fock vacuum .",

    "the associated formal hamiltonian density is @xmath41 we shall be interested in the expectation value of @xmath42 in certain states .",
    "taking as a state the fock vacuum state ( 1 ) , we find for the expectation value of the formal hamiltonian density @xmath43 where @xmath44 is given by ( 3 ) and @xmath45 denotes the fourier transform of @xmath46 .",
    "the necessity of using a test function f - as usual in lqft , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the schwartz space of infinitely differentiable functions of fast decrease [ 11]- is due to the fact that @xmath49 is , for fixed time @xmath50 , a distribution , an essential feature of lqft , and the limit @xmath51 , @xmath52 being the delta function , is ill - defined : there is a well - known reason for that , both mathematical and physical , see ( [ 12 ] , p.35 ) for a nice elementary physical discussion .",
    "unfortunately , there is a too large indeterminacy associated to the test function @xmath46 in ( 7 ) .",
    "this is one of the basic problems in applications to cosmology , where we wish to compute a `` local '' value of the energy density , at least closest possible to the approximation of perfect homogeneity , which is surprisingly successful [ 13 ] .    in order to attack the above problem",
    ", we attempt to `` restrict '' the quantum field to certain simple compact regions , characterized by some fixed number with the dimensions of length , which we denote by @xmath8 .",
    "the simplest choice is a cube of side @xmath8,with a collection of such cubes providing a cover of euclidean space .",
    "with such a choice , @xmath8 still remains as a free parameter , but the indeterminacy is widely reduced .",
    "what is , however , the correct formula for the hamiltonian density in this case ?",
    "on fock space @xmath29 , the quantity @xmath42 , formally defined by the r.h.s . of ( 6 ) ,",
    "is not a well - defined operator - valued distribution : only the wick - ordered density @xmath53 is one . in going over from",
    "( 8) to a compact region @xmath54 with boundary @xmath55 , it is convenient to rewrite the wick product in ( 8) using the point - splitting technique ( [ 4],p.316;[6 ] , appendix ) and reexpressing the field in terms of different creation and annihilation operators @xmath56 associated to the eigenfunctions given below in ( 11d),(11e)(see ( 10 ) of [ 4 ] for details ) .",
    "these fields , denoted by @xmath57 , define a new representation , corresponding to a different observable algebra ( the hilbert space of test functions is no longer @xmath58 , see ( [ 5 ] , ( 2.13 ) et ff ) , a new density @xmath59 , which results from writing ( 6 ) in the new representation , and a new vacuum @xmath60 , annihilated by the new absorption operators associated to the eigenfunctions .",
    "the latter defines a new vacuum state @xmath61 given by @xmath62 we write now @xmath59 as a sum of a wick - ordered term with respect to @xmath60 - denoted by a semicolon- and the @xmath60- vacuum energy @xmath63 , obtaining ( this is the precise analogue of formula ( 13a ) of [ 4 ] for the case @xmath0 ) : @xmath64 we now obtain from ( 10 ) ( for details , see , again [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] or [ 5 ] ) : @xmath65 where @xmath66 @xmath67 , with @xmath68 denoting a complete set of normalized eigenfunctions of the laplacian in @xmath54 , satisfying the prescribed b.c . on @xmath55 , i.e. @xmath69 above , @xmath21 is a discrete set which depends on the chosen b.c . , and @xmath70    it",
    "should be remarked that the distribution @xmath71 in ( 8) is preserved in ( 10 ) : this fact is very important and will be referred to as * normalization condition * [ 3 ] : it is reflected by the presence of the distribution term @xmath72 on the right hand side of ( 11a ) .",
    "it is the only possible universal normalization condition , because only the field @xmath73 in infinite ( minkowski ) space - time is a standard ( universal ) object .",
    "this is the justification of ( 10 ) , ( 11a ) , on which all our results are based .    for a conformally invariant scalar quantum field , which is traceless , i.e.    @xmath74 the r.h.s . of ( 11a )",
    "is finite and homogeneous for dirichlet ( and neumann ) b.c .",
    "this is due to a remarkable cancellation brought about by ( 12a)[8 ] . in applications to cosmology ,    @xmath75 with @xmath76 , and thus ( 12a ) is not valid : see section iv .",
    "for this reason we are led to study an ( ordinary ) quantum scalar field , for which dirichlet and neumann b.c .",
    "are incompatible with the general principles of lqft [ 5 ] .",
    "this fact , not generally appreciated , was also emphasized by hagen [ 14 ] with a different wording , i.e. , that there is no justification to eliminate the ensuing divergent surface terms .",
    "these result from the wild fluctuations of quantum fields over sharp surfaces [ 15 ] .",
    "there remains the choice of periodic b.c . as the only sufficiently `` soft '' b.c .",
    ", which we adopt as in [ 5 ] .",
    "this choice is technical , but has a nice property in the applications to cosmology : the ensuing energy density may be shown to be uniform i.e , independent of @xmath7 , and equals the average value of the energy in a cube of side @xmath8 containing the point , with periodic b.c .. the parameter @xmath8 plays the role of the test function in ( 7 ) and is to be chosen as small as the local structure of quantum fields permits , approaching as closely as possible the idealized condition of perfect homogeneity of classical cosmology .    in order to find upper and lower bounds on @xmath8 we need , however , to compute the r.h.s . of ( 11a ) .",
    "for that purpose we introduce the cutoff field ( 5 ) and prove in the forthcoming section iii that , for a large class of cutoff functions @xmath40 , we obtain a uniform energy density ( 25 ) and the thermodynamic pressure ( 27 ) in closed form .",
    "we consider a cube of side @xmath8 adopting periodic b.c . , so that the set @xmath21 in ( 11c ) is @xmath77 , with eigenfunctions in ( 11d ) , given by @xmath78 and @xmath79 in ( 11e ) of the form @xmath80^{1/2 } \\eqno{(13b)}\\ ] ] in order to evaluate the r.h.s . of ( 10 ) and ( 11a ) , we use regularized fields ( 5 ) as well as regularized fields @xmath81 corresponding to the fields @xmath57 in the new representation .",
    "let @xmath82 denote the r.h.s . of ( 11a ) but with @xmath72 ( resp .",

    "the proof of theorem1 is identical to the proof of regularization independence of the `` finite part '' of the energy - which is identical to the whole energy in the case of periodic b.c .",
    ", see ( [ 5 ] , remark 3.6 ) - for @xmath93 in ( [ 5 ] , theorems 3.1 and 3.2 ) .",
    "that proof is an adaptation of the remarkable treatment in g.h .",
    "hardy s book [ 16 ] .",
    "we therefore omit the details and derive the results adopting a special convenient regularizer : @xmath94 obtaining for the corresponding cutoff version of the r.h.s . of ( 11a ) : @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97^{1/2 } \\eqno{(18)}\\ ] ] using , now , the poisson summation formula on ( 17 ) :    @xmath98    where    @xmath99    with    @xmath100^{1/2}e^{-\\lambda\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\vec{k}}{l}\\right)^2+\\mu^2\\right ] } \\eqno{(19c)}\\ ] ]    changing from cartesian to spherical coordinates , one obtains from the terms with @xmath101 in ( 19b ) : @xmath102 @xmath103 where @xmath104 . from the term @xmath105 in ( 19b ) @xmath106 @xmath107 one sees that the term @xmath105 ( 20b ) is exactly the first term in ( 16 ) but with opposite sign .",

    ", if the normalization condition ( term @xmath72 in ( 11a ) ) is not imposed , there is no cancellation of the term ( 20b ) and the result diverges as @xmath119 .",
    "this yields a result which is off by a factor of order @xmath120 upon taking @xmath121 equal to the inverse of the planck length [ 25 ] .",

    "as is well - known , it is the advent of quantum field theory which made consideration of the cosmological constant obligatory , not optional , as discussed by zeldovich many years before the acceleration of the expansion of the universe was discovered [ 25 ] . indeed , the only possible covariant form for the energy of the quantum vacuum is ( 12b ) , which is mathematically equivalent to the cosmological constant @xmath121 by    @xmath132    ( 12b ) takes the form of a perfect fluid with energy density @xmath133 and isotropic pressure @xmath134 which corresponds to ( 1b ) of the introduction .",

    "in particular , the energy density and the pressure do not depend either on the time or on the space variable , only on @xmath8 , and therefore are homogeneous , as expected for a theory of dark energy in the approximation of perfect homogeneity ( see , e.g. , [ 13 ] ) , which has , of course , nothing to do with the real physical cosmological homogeneity , whose scale is of order @xmath198 [ 30 ] , and is traditionally accounted for theoretically by cosmological perturbation theory ( see , e.g. , [ 33 ] ) .",
    "in this paper we used the conceptual framework introduced in [ 5 ] to obtain closed form expressions for the energy density and the pressure of a massive quantum scalar field with periodic b.c . on a cube , which completes the analysis of [ 8 ] .",
    "as an application , we showed that positivity ( 1c ) and the cosmological constant property ( 1b ) hold true for a special state of the quantum field consisting of the vacuum and ( a certain density of ) one - particle excitations of zero momentum , if the length of the cube is a fixed number of the order of the compton wavelength of the particle .",
    "we consider two points of special relevance in our work .",
    "the first one was to point out how strong the constraints of negative pressure and the cosmological constant condition are : they are , in particular , inconsistent with the catastrophic limit @xmath17 , because they require positivity of the energy density ( 1c ) .",
    "the second basic point is the crucial role played by the condition of nonzero mass @xmath0 : for zero mass , if one attempts to make @xmath199 positive by adjoining low energy one - particle excitations , the resulting pressure will be positive and ( 1c ) can never be realized . in this connection , it is of interest to remark that the emergence of an effective cosmological constant in [ 1 ] seems to require positive mass .",
    "our tentative approach to dark energy hinges on the existence of a hypothetical scalar particle . even in the hypothesis of detection of the axion ( discussed in detail in ( [ 29 ] , section 10.5.1 ) , several difficult problems would remain open , in particular , what would be the reason for the extraordinary stability of the hypothetical initial state ( 30 ) ? in this respect ,",
    "the analysis of [ 1 ] , based on hadamard states , goes much deeper : it is also to be stressed that we assumed the existence of a cosmological constant , and looked at the compatibility of this assumption with a state of the massive quantum scalar field ( see also [ 23],[24 ] ) , while the authors of [ 1 ] obtained it from first principles . on the other hand",
    ", the analysis of [ 1 ] seems to contain several a priori undetermined constants , while ours is able to make a definite prediction on the range of the particle masses as to yield a good comparison with experimental data .",
    "in fact , the numbers of [ 28 ] yield a good comparison with the latter if the state ( 30 ) is assumed , as shown at the end of section iv .    as a technical open problem",
    ", we observe that theorem 1 does not prove that the distribution at the r.h.s . of ( 11a ) is the function ( 14e ) , although this is to be expected .",
    "we are grateful to the referee for remarks which led to an important conceptual reformulation of a previous version of the paper .",
