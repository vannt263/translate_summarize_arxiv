    "the concept of elementary excitations and the diagrammatic perturbation - theoretic methods borrowed from quantum field theory have given us , over the past decades , many powerful insights into the behavior of materials . in a number of cases , however , these concepts and methods do nt seem to work . in previous papers@xcite , we presented results on a nonperturbative extension of the magnetic interaction model , which had until then been extensively used in the context of diagrammatic approaches .",
    "these latter applications were successful in many respects : in the eliashberg approximation , the magnetic interaction model correctly anticipated the pairing symmetry of the cooper state in the copper oxide superconductors@xcite and is consistent with spin - triplet p - wave pairing in superfluid @xmath0 [ for a recent review see , e.g. , ref .",
    "one also gets the correct order of magnitude of the superconducting and superfluid transition temperature @xmath1 when the model parameters are inferred from experiments in the normal state of the above systems .",
    "however , in ref.@xcite it was found that when the model was treated nonperturbatively and one approached the border of magnetic long - range order , the quasiparticle spectrum showed qualitative changes not captured by the eliashberg approximation . in ref.@xcite",
    ", we raised the possibility that these qualitative changes , namely the opening of a pseudogap in the quasiparticle spectrum , were intrinsically nonperturbative in nature . in this paper",
    ", we examine this possibility by comparing the nonperturbative results to various kinds of perturbation - theoretic approximations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the model as well as the various perturbation - theoretic approximations to be compared to the monte carlo calculations .",

    "therefore , we generated 100 noisy measurements by adding gaussian random noise to the results of the diagrammatic calculations and analytically continued @xmath94 using the maximum entropy method as well , with the same default model as in the corresponding analytic continuation of the monte carlo data .",
    "the scheme is not perfect , however . while the variance of the gaussian noise added to the diagrammatic green s functions",
    "was chosen such that the statistical uncertainty of the average over the 100 noisy samples was identical to that in the corresponding monte carlo green s function , the correlations in the errors for different values of @xmath12 present in the monte carlo results can not be easily modeled .",

    "thus the small difference in the spectral functions @xmath96 at @xmath100 , seen in fig 3b , to the extent that they are not an artifact of the analytic continuation , must come from the vertex corrections . since the first order spectral functions are slightly sharper than the second order ones , the first order vertex corrections result in an increased spin - fluctuation interaction , as pointed out in refs.@xcite .",
    "the monte carlo spectral function is also somewhat broader than the diagrammatic calculations , and provided again that it is not an artifact of the analytic continuation , this suggests that the higher order diagrams lead to a further increase of the spin - fluctuation interaction .",

    ", one can make a few additional remarks .",
    "first of all , there is now a difference between the straightforward perturbation - theoretic results and the self - consistent calculations of the spectral function @xmath96 at @xmath100 , both at first and second order .",
    "in particular , the second order self - consistent spectral function is slightly broader than the first order self - consistent one , an indication that the first order vertex correction leads to an enhancement of the effective spin - fluctuation interaction , in agreement with refs.@xcite .",
    "the nonperturbative @xmath104 is broader than the second order self - consistent result , which would imply the higher order vertex corrections are further enhancing the magnetic interaction .",
    "note , that the second order perturbation - theoretic @xmath104 is slightly broader than its self - consistent counterpart ( the dressing of green s functions tends to reduce the effect of interactions ) and agrees very well with the monte carlo result .",
    "this may be due to a cancellation of errors ( or the analytic continuation procedure ) since the agreement between the nonperturbative tunneling density of states @xmath97 and the second order perturbation - theoretic @xmath97 is not as good .",
    "as @xmath105 , the quasiparticle mean free path becomes of the order of the magnetic correlation length for some wavevectors near the fermi surface , the quasiparticles then ca nt tell there is no long - range order , and this marks the onset of pseudogap behavior@xcite . for @xmath106 ,",
    "the mass renormalization parameter is @xmath107 .",
    "one is therefore in the strong coupling regime .",
    "the results of our calculations for @xmath106 are shown in fig .",
    "5 . the developing pseudogap in the spectral function @xmath96 at @xmath100 ( fig . 5b ) and in the tunneling density of states @xmath97 ( fig .",
    "5e ) found in the nonperturbative monte carlo calculations is not seen in any of the diagrammatic approximations considered here , which therefore fail qualitatively . given that one is in the strong coupling regime @xmath108 , the breakdown of perturbation theory should not come as a surprise .",
    "the maximum difference in the quasiparticle green s function @xmath90 between the nonperturbative and diagrammatic calculations is now of the order 0.1 t , and hence an order of magnitude larger than for @xmath102 and a couple of orders of magnitude larger than in the weak coupling regime with @xmath98 .",
    "it is therefore not suprprising that the quasiparticle spectra that give rise to these rather different imaginary time green s functions turn out to show qualitative differences .",
    "note that for @xmath106 , there is nearly as much difference between the perturbation - theoretic and self - consistent approximations of the same order as there are between calculations of the same type at first and second order .",

    "show our results for the quasiparticle green s function @xmath90 , spectral function @xmath96 and tunneling density of states @xmath97 for several values of @xmath95 .",
    "we start with @xmath98 , for which the mass renormalization parameter @xmath99 for coupling to ferromagnetic spin - flucutations . in this weak coupling regime , fig .",
    "6 shows that the results of the various diagrammatic calculations are in good agreement with the monte carlo results .",
    "as in the corresponding antiferromagnetic case , at @xmath100 , the difference between the nonperturbative green s function @xmath101 and its diagrammatic approximations is of the order of 0.001 t for all values of @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , there is virtually no difference between the straightforward perturbation - theoretic calculations of the spectral function and their self - consistent counterparts , in first and second order .",
    "thus the small difference in the spectral functions @xmath96 at @xmath100 , seen in fig .",
    "6b must come from the vertex corrections .",
    "since the first order spectral functions are slightly sharper than the second order ones , the first order vertex corrections result in an increased spin - fluctuation interaction .",
    "given the smallness of the difference between the first and second order results and the ill - posed nature of the analytic continuation problem , one should take the above remark with some degree of caution . in ref.@xcite",
    ", however , it was shown that the increase in the effective interaction induced by the first order vertex correction is due to the spin dependence of the interaction , and thus should occur for quasiparticles coupled to either antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "our analytically continued results are at least consistent with this . from fig .",
    "6b , one also sees that the monte carlo spectral function is slightly broader than the first or second order results , as in the corresponding antiferromagnetic case . with the above caveat on the nature of the analytic continuation problem",
    ", this would suggest the higher order diagrams not included in our perturbation - theoretic approximations lead to a further enhancement of the magnetic interaction , as in the corresponding antiferromagnetic case .",
    "for @xmath102 , the mass renormalization parameter @xmath109 and one is therefore in an intermediate coupling regime . fig .",
    "7 shows that for this value of @xmath95 , the diagrammatic approximations all qualitatively agree with the monte carlo results .",
    "the quantitative agreement is , not surprisingly , not as good as in the weak coupling limit with @xmath98 .",
    "one notes a number of similarities between the results of fig . 6 and the corresponding antiferromagnetic case , shown in fig . 4 : ( i ) the second order perturbation theory results for @xmath96",
    "give the best agreement with the nonperturbative calculation , ( ii ) since the spectral function in either second order calculation , which include vertex corrections , is slightly broader in @xmath110 than the corresponding first order result , we conclude that first order vertex corrections lead to an enhancement of the effective quasiparticle interaction , which is what is expected on the basis of the arguments made in refs.@xcite ( iii ) the spectral function obtained by monte carlo sampling of the gaussian dynamical molecular fields is slightly broader than the second order results , which to the extent this is not an artifact of the maximum entropy analytic continuation is an indication that higher order spin - fluctuation exchanges not included in the diagrammatic approximations considered lead to a further enhancement of the effective quasiparticle interaction .    the dynamical exponent @xmath111 is larger for ferromagnetic than antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "hence the effective dimension @xmath112 in the ferromagnetic versus @xmath113 in the antiferromagnetic case and the standard theory of quantum critical phenomena@xcite leads one to expect weaker corrections for higher effective dimensions .",
    "the perturbative calculations qualitatively fail at @xmath105 in the antiferromagnetic case and on the basis of the above arguments one would expect that the breakdown of perturbation theory in the case of ferromagnetic fluctuations , if it happens , would occur for a smaller value of @xmath95 or larger values of the mass renormalization parameter @xmath65 .",
    "indeed , at @xmath106 , @xmath114 and therefore one is in the strong coupling regime .",
    "8 shows that while for this value of @xmath95 the diagrammatic calculations still agree qualitatively with the monte carlo results , unsurprisingly there are larger quantitative differences than in the case @xmath102 shown in fig .",
    "7 .    our results for @xmath115 , for which the mass renormalization parameter @xmath116 are shown in fig .",
    "9 . the spectral function @xmath96 obtained from the nonperturbative monte carlo calculations shows a double peak structure .",
    "this has been interpreted in ref.@xcite as an effective spin - splitting of the quasiparticle spectrum induced by the local ferromagnetic order . in looking at the evolution of the spectral function @xmath96 as @xmath95",
    "is decreased , one first sees a broadening of @xmath96 and then , the broad quasiparticle peak splits into two .",
    "the monte carlo calculations show very little suppression of the quasiparticle spectral weight or density of states between the two split peaks . a look at figs .",
    "7c , 8c , and 9e reveals that for @xmath117 , @xmath118 and depends very little on @xmath95 .",
    "this is is sharp contrast to the case of antiferromagnetic fluctuations discussed in the previous section .",
    "this difference is to be expected of course , since the antiferromagnetic state is gapped while the ferromagnetic state is not .",
    "it is clear that none of the diagrammatic approximations considered here reproduce this spin - splitting of the broad quasiparticle peak in @xmath96 and tunneling density of states @xmath97 well .",
    "in fact , the first order perturbation theoretic result shows a strong suppression of the tunelling density of states , which clearly does nt describe the precursor to the ferromagnetic state well , and therefore can be considered to fail qualitatively .",
    "we observe that the first order perturbation theoretic calculation failed to show a suppression of the tunneling density of states in the antiferromagnetic case where it is obtained in the nonperturbative calculations as expected ( see previous subsection ) but does show such a pseudogap in the ferromagnetic case where it is nt expected and does nt appear in the nonperturbative calculations .",
    "it therefore qualitatively fails in both cases . another clear sign that not all is well with the perturbation expansion is the large quantitative differences between the one - loop and two - loop results in fig.9 , something that could be expected at @xmath116 .",
    "in the view of the differences between the imaginary time green s function @xmath90 obtained from the monte carlo simulations and those of the various perturbation - theoretic approximations shown in figs . 9a and 9c which are of the order of 0.1 t , one would expect the spectral functions that produce these rather different imaginary time green s functions to be rather different themselves .",

    "10 correspond to @xmath119 , namely the coupling to the charge fluctuations is weak .",
    "the agreement between the monte carlo results and those of the various diagrammatic approximations is good . as seen in fig .",
    "10a , the difference between the nonperturbative imaginary time green s function and its perturbative approximations at @xmath100 is less than the width of the line and of the order of 0.001 t for all imaginary times @xmath12 .",

    "10b that there is virtually no difference between the spectral functions @xmath96 obtained by straightforward perturbation theory or the self - consistent calculation at either first or second order .",
    "hence the slight difference bewteen the first and second order calculations , to the extent they are nt an artifact of the analytic continuation , must come from vertex corrections .",
    "in contrast to the case of coupling to antiferromagnetic fluctuations , the spectral functions at second order are slightly narrower than their first order counterpart .",
    "this suggests the first order vertex correction acts to reduce the effective charge fluctuation interaction , in agreement with the arguments presented in ref.@xcite .",

    "the reason is that both second order approximations , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , for the model parameters considered here , effectively violate causality requirements in that the eliashberg renormalization factor @xmath120 becomes less than one . in terms of the quasiparticle self - energy @xmath54 , @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the imaginary part of the retarded self - energy and we have made use of the spectral representation for the self - energy @xmath123 .",
    "causality demands that the retarded green s function be analytic in the upper - half complex frequency plane and therefore that the imaginary part of the retarded self - energy be always less than or equal to zero ( @xmath124 ) for all values of @xmath125 .",
    "this in turn means that @xmath126 for all values of @xmath125 .",
    "one can write the second order eliashberg renormalization factor @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the change in @xmath120 coming from the @xmath129 order diagrams .",
    "@xmath130 is always greater than zero and therefore poses no problem as far as the condition @xmath126 is concerned . in the charge - fluctuation case , as was explained in ref.@xcite , the first order vertex correction has the opposite sign compared to the spin - fluctuation case , and leads to a suppression of the effective quasiparticle interaction .",
    "the enhancement of the quasiparticle spin - fluctuation vertex comes from the transverse magnetic fluctuations that manage to overcome the reduction of the effective coupling due to the longitudinal fluctuations . because of this cancellation effect , not only is the sign of the first order vertex correction different in the magnetic case , it is also smaller in magnitude than in the charge - fluctuation case , under otherwise similar conditions , as can be seen from the factor 1/3 in eqs .",
    "( [ 2ptm],[2scm ] ) not present in the corresponding charge - fluctuation case in eqs .",
    "( [ 2ptc],[2scc ] ) .",
    "the different sign of the vertex corrections in the charge and magnetic cases means that while in the magnetic case @xmath131 and at second order @xmath132 is always @xmath133 , in the charge fluctuation case @xmath134 . for @xmath117 , we find that the second order contribution to the eliashberg renormalization factor is greater in magnitude than the first order contribution , @xmath135 .",
    "note that the nonperturbative calculations always satisfy @xmath136 , and the problem only arises in the perturbative approximation and is a sign that , for @xmath117 , the perturbation expansion for the charge - fluctuation case is quite badly behaved , possibly even more so than for magnetic fluctuations .",
    "aso , the fact that the nonperturbative calculations always satisfy @xmath136 is a proof that the higher than second order diagrams contribute to an enhancement of the charge - fluctuation interaction for these values of @xmath95 .    fig .",
    "11b shows that the spectral function @xmath96 obtained from the nonperturbative calculations is noticeably sharper than those produced by the first order self - consistent calculations .",
    "this means that for @xmath85 and @xmath82 the first and higher order vertex corrections suppress the effective quasiparticle interaction .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that there are no qualitative differences between the nonperturbative and diagrammatic calculations .",
    "there are quantitative differences , however , and these are more pronounced than in the case of a coupling of quasiparticles to antiferromagnetic spin - fluctuations for the same value of @xmath65 shown in fig .",
    "4 .    finally ,",
    "12 shows our results for @xmath115 , for which @xmath137 , hence in the strong coupling regime .",
    "the difference between the nonperturbative imaginary time green s function and its first order diagrammatic approximations seen in figs .",
    "12b and 12d is a clear indication of the breakdown of perturbation theory . but even in this strong coupling regime , a cdw - precursor pseudogap in the spectral function @xmath96 , which can be expected to occur on general grounds@xcite is not seen .",
    "the pseudogap effects in the charge fluctuation case thus require a stronger coupling still ( larger coupling constant @xmath138 or smaller value of @xmath95 ) .",
    "in ref.@xcite , we showed that the magnetic pseudogap induced by a coupling to antiferromagnetic spin - fluctuations and the spin - splitting of the quasiparticle peak induced by a coupling to ferromagnetic spin fluctuations were not captured by the first order self - consistent , or eliashberg , approximation .",
    "the main result of this paper , is that these phenomena also lie beyond the two magnetic - fluctuation exchange theories ( self - consistent or not ) , which contain first order vertex corrections . while this does obviously not constitute a proof , these results are consistent with the conjecture expressed in ref.@xcite that the pseudogap effects found in the monte carlo calculations are intrinsically nonperturbative in nature .",
    "since the calculations reported here show that the first order vertex corrections alone do not produce a magnetic pseudogap , the physics of that state must then mainly come from the higher order spin - fluctuation exchange processes .",
    "the results presented here and in ref.@xcite also indicate that a cdw pseudogap induced by coupling to the scalar dynamical molecular field ( eq .",
    "( [ ham2 ] ) ) must also originate from high order charge - fluctuation exchange processes .",
    "close enough to a second order cdw transition , the diverging cdw correlation length is bound to exceed the characteristic length scale for quasiparticles and the calculations of ref.@xcite showed that when this happens a pseudogap opens in the quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "the first order vertex correction ca nt produce the pseudogap state , since as we have seen , in the case of charge fluctuations it leads to a suppression of the interaction .",
    "in fact we even found that for the range of model parameters considered here , the second order diagrams more than cancel the contribution from the first order terms leading to a second order eliashberg renormalization parameter @xmath139 , which is inconsistent with causality requirements .",
    "moreover , we expect this `` over - cancellation '' effect to get worse as @xmath95 gets smaller than the lowest value considered here , @xmath115 .",
    "since @xmath120 must be @xmath133 when all the diagrams are summed up , as in the monte carlo simulations , one can conclude that the higher than second order terms must give a contribution @xmath140 to @xmath141 which is positive .",
    "therefore , higher order charge - fluctuation exchange processes produce an enhancement of the effective quasiparticle interaction , as in the magnetic case , and it must be through this enhancement of the effective interaction that a pseudogap can appear in the quasiparticle spectrum on the border of long - range cdw order .",
    "these observations lead one to a unified picture of the pseudogap state found in our model of quasiparticles coupled to spin or charge fluctuations .",
    "when the dynamical molecular field correlation length exceeds the characteristic length scale for quasiparticles , either the thermal de broglie wavelength@xcite or mean free path@xcite , the quasiparticles effectively see long - range order and this marks the onset of the pseudogap state .",
    "this state must be produced by high order spin or charge - fluctuation exchanges which contain subtle quantum mechanical coherence effects . in the magnetic fluctuation case ,",
    "the first order vertex correction favors the pseudogap state , while in the charge fluctuation case it suppresses it .",
    "this implies one has to be closer to the boundary of long - range charge order to observe a pseudogap than one has to be to the boundary of magnetic long - range order , under otherwise similar conditions .",
    "as the dynamical molecular field correlation length increases , the mass renormalization parameter @xmath65 gets larger , and therefore the many - body effects become stronger .",
    "our results show that the agreement between the results of the monte carlo simulations and the perturbation - theoretic results gets worse as @xmath65 increases , and that not surprisingly , the perturbation - theoretic calculations break down when one enters the strong coupling regime @xmath108 , where the pseudogap is found . a more rigourous analysis of the relevance of the effective quasiparticle interactions as @xmath95 increases or as the energy scales are decreased would require a renormalization group ( rg ) treatment@xcite .",
    "recent rg calculations@xcite on the border of the ferromagnetic state indicate that the quasiparticle interactions are indeed relevant in @xmath142 , and the rg flows to strong coupling as the energy cutoff is decreased .",
    "one would like to understand what property of the full vertex function @xmath143 is responsible for the appearance of the pseudogap and seems to be missing in the first order approximation to @xmath144 .",
    "our physical picture of the pseudogap state emerging from quantum mechanical coherence effects contained in high order feynman diagrams is to be contrasted with the results of refs.@xcite where a suppression of the quasiparticle tunneling density of states at the fermi level is obtained in the single spin or charge - fluctuation exchange approximation .",
    "this effect is typically obtained with relatively large magnetic or charge correlation lengths . in our model ,",
    "the calculations reported here and in ref.@xcite show that as one approaches the border of magnetic long - range order , @xmath145 , the multiple spin - fluctuation exchange processes become important long before a suppression of the quasiparticle tunneling density of states at the fermi level is seen in the first order perturbation - theoretic and self - consistent calculations .",
    "indeed , pseudogap effects are only obtined in our calculations when the dimensionless mass renormalization parameter @xmath108 , i.e in the strong coupling regime where one does nt expect diagrammatic perturbation theory to give reliable approximations .",
    "the above finding is likely to be valid more generally , since the intuitive arguments for the physical origin of the pseudogap@xcite lead one to expect the breakdown of migdal s theorem to be a generic occurence near a spin or charge instability .",
    "there is also an important difference between a vertex correction induced pseudogap and a single - fluctuation exchange pseudogap . in the latter case",
    ", there is no essential distinction bewteen spin and charge fluctuations , in that at the single - fluctuation exchange level , for a given fluctuation spectrum the spin and charge - fluctuation theories of the quasiparticle spectral function can be made identical by an appropriate scaling of the coupling constant to the molecular field .",
    "this is no longer the case when vertex corrections are included , since these actually depend on the nature of the hubbard - stratonovich field , in our case vector versus scalar .",
    "the distinction could turn out to be essential , since we find , for a range of model parameters , that a pseudogap is observed for quasiparticles coupled to spin fluctuations but not in the corresponding charge - fluctuation case .",
    "moukouri et al.@xcite have developed a many - body theory of the precursor pseudogap to the mott transition in the half - filled hubbard model .",
    "their theory is inspired by the fluctuation exchange approximation ( flex)@xcite in which bare spin and charge susceptibilities are used to build up the effective quasiparticle interaction , corresponding to @xmath146 in our model .",
    "the key respect in which the theory of moukouri et al.@xcite differs from flex is that the coupling to spin and charge fluctuations are not given by the bare on - site coulomb repulsion , but by renormalized parameters determined self - consistently in such a way that an exact relationship between the single and two - particle green s functions is satisfied .",
    "this last step goes beyond perturbation theory and it is therefore plausible that the precursor pseudogap to the mott transition seen in the monte carlo simulations of the half - filled hubbard model@xcite is also nonperturbative in origin . the analog of their scheme for the present model would be the use of the first order perturbation theory approximation for the quasiparticle self - energy @xmath147 , eq .",
    "( [ 1pt ] ) and a simultaneous renormalization of the coupling constant @xmath16 and the correlation wavevector @xmath95 .",
    "a renormalization of the coupling constant @xmath16 could account for all vertex corrections provided they are local in space and time .",
    "one can indeed get a pseudogap in the tunneling density of states with the first order perturbation theory approximation to @xmath148 ( eq .  ( [ 1pt ] ) ) , as in refs.@xcite , provided @xmath95 is renormalized to lower values and @xmath16 renormalized to higher ones .",
    "one would thus have to renormalize the model to stronger coupling , roughly to values of @xmath149 .",
    "it should be clear that in this regime , first order perturbation theory is not controlled .",
    "one would also naively expect a sensible renormalization scheme that goes beyond the one - loop level to lead to renormalized values of @xmath95 larger than the bare value . the renormalized theory should be further away from the magnetic instability than the one - loop approximation rather than closer to it , since ideally one would like the improved theory to satisfy the mermin - wagner theorem in two dimensions .",
    "if @xmath95 were to be increased by the renormalization scheme , in order to obtain a pseudogap in @xmath97 one would likely need a large renormalization of the coupling @xmath16 and such a scheme for the present model does not look promising to the author .",
    "however , it is important to note that the model studied here , although similar in some respects , is actually different than the one considered in ref.@xcite . the renormalization scheme proposed by moukouri et al .",
    "which works well for the hubbard model need not necessarily apply to other theories .    in ref.@xcite , we pointed out that in the case of quasiparticles coupled to ferromagnetic spin fluctuations , our results are at variance with expectations based on the standard theory of quantum critical phenomena@xcite . since the dynamical exponent @xmath150 , in @xmath151 spatial dimensions ,",
    "the effective dimension is @xmath112 and is greater than the upper critical dimension @xmath152 above which one would expect the first order theory to be at least qualitatively correct .",
    "but our nonperturbative results show that at least for small enough @xmath95 , the first order theory qualitatively breaks down .",
    "al@xcite have shown that the quasiparticle interactions are indeed relevant in the rg sense for ferromagnetic fluctuations in @xmath142 , a result consistent with our findings .",
    "for antiferromagnetic and charge fluctuations , @xmath113 , the marginal case , and hence the qualitative breakdown of the first order approximation is nt necessarily inconsistent with the standard theory .",
    "however , the scaling relations derived in ref.@xcite rely on the applicability of perturbation theory . if the pseudogap effects are indeed intrinsically nonperturbative in nature , a conjecture that is consistent with the present work , it opens the possibility that the physics in the proximity of a quantum critical point is dominated by nonperturbative quantum mechanical effects and therefore even richer than anticipated in the earlier work@xcite .",
    "a number of new ideas in this field have recently been proposed@xcite and a discussion of some fundamental problems associated with quantum critical points can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "we studied a nonperturbative formulation of the magnetic interaction model , in which quasiparticles are coupled to a gaussian distributed dynamical molecular exchange field .",
    "far from the magnetic boundary , the multiple magnetic fluctuation exchange processes do not bring about qualitative changes to the quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "but as one gets closer to the border of long - range magnetic order , we find , for a range of model parameters , that migdal s theorem does nt apply and the quasiparticle spectrum is qualitatively different from its eliashberg approximation .",
    "moreover , we find that going one step beyond the single spin - fluctuation exchange approximation and including first order vertex corrections , self - consistently or not , does nt help to reproduce the qualitative changes seen in the nonperturbative calculations . near the magnetic boundary",
    ", the simple perturbation expansion shows signs it is not well behaved , since the second order results differ greatly from their first order counterparts .",
    "the self - consistent , or renormalized perturbation expansion , which effectively consists in a reordering of the diagrammatic perturbation theory , is better behaved in that the differences between first and second order are much less pronounced . however , even if the renormalized perturbation expansion converges , our results show that it is quite likely to converge to the wrong answer , which could be explained if the original perturbation expansion is divergent .    the intuitive argument for the onset of pseudogap behavior@xcite , namely that if the distance quasiparticles can travel during their lifetime becomes shorter than the molecular field correlation length , these quasiparticles effectively see long - range order , does not explain the failure of the single spin - fluctuation exchange approximation . as we pointed out in ref.@xcite",
    ", one can get in the regime where the mean - free path gets shorter than @xmath153 in the eliashberg approximation , but fail to observe a pseudogap in this regime .",
    "since we have not been able to produce a good fit to the monte carlo simulations by including either first order or vertex corrections that are local in space and time , i.e by a renormalization of the coupling constant @xmath16 to the molecular field , we conjecture that the physical origin of the pseudogap state found in the present calculations lies in non - local vertex corrections produced by high order spin - fluctuation exchanges .",
    "these vertex corrections effectively induce a quasiparticle coupling to the dynamical molecular field that is non - local in both space and time .",
    "the above conjecture raise the question of what essential property of the vertex function is not captured by its first order approximation .",
    "a study of the vertex function along the same lines as the work reported here for the single particle green s function should provide further insights into this problem .",
