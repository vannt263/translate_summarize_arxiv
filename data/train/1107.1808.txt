    "the higgs boson search is the most important search at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , because it is an essential part of the standard - model electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "current electroweak fits , together with the lep and tevatron exclusion limit , favour a light higgs boson one with mass around 120 gev  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "it is a challenging task for the discovery of higgs boson at this mass region  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "the mass dropping and filtering method introduced in  @xcite makes the higgs boson production channel associated with a vector boson very promising . in this channel ,",
    "the higgs boson will decay hadronically into two b - tagged jet with the vector boson decay leptonically .",
    "the dominant background for this process is @xmath5,@xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we will employ a similar kinematic selection to  @xcite , but we will reconstruct the higgs boson using the jet trimming technique  @xcite .",
    "jet trimming  @xcite is a designated procedure for removing the isr / mi / pileup from the fsr .",
    "the intrinsic idea is that isr / mi / pileup will be much softer than the fsr , therefore , we will form a fat jet using a larger cone and then recluster the fat jet with a smaller cone and throw away the softer subjets .",
    "we will make some change to the original algorithm described in  @xcite for the jet substructure of the boosted higgs boson .",
    "first , we will find the two b - tagged jets by clustering the jet constituents of the fat jet .",
    "also , the higgs jet , different from a qcd jet , is a dipole itself , so we expect to have more radiation between the two b quarks .",
    "therefore , we will use a dynamical @xmath8 , which is proportional to the distance between the subjet and the fat jet .",
    "the jet trimming algorithm proceeds as follows :    * cluster all the final state particles with fastjet 2.4.2  @xcite , anti@xmath9 algorithm with a cone size 1.2 . * cluster the particles in the hardest jet with a smaller cone size 0.3 with anti@xmath9 algorithm to find out the hardest two subjets , and we will require each of the two subjets to be b tagged . we assume a 60% tagging efficiency and 2% of mistagging efficiency . * cluster the remaining particles with an even smaller cone size 0.2 with @xmath9 algorithm to form the subjets . *",
    "if @xmath10 the subjet is kept else it is trimmed , @xmath11 is the @xmath12 of the fat jet and @xmath13 is the distance between the subjet and the fat jet .",
    "the @xmath8 is chosen to be 0.03 in this analysis .",
    "* now we have the higgs candidate .",
    "we will require the higgs candidate @xmath12 larger than 200 gev and @xmath14 less than 2.5 .",
    "the events are generated by pythia 6.403  @xcite , fully showered and hadronized .",
    "the underlying event is incorporated by pythia `` dw '' tune . for this analysis ,",
    "signal samples of @xmath15 were generated , as well as @xmath16 to study backgrounds .",
    "there are three search channels in this analysis and the channel specific cuts are very similar to  @xcite :    * leptonic channel : two opposite sign lepton ( @xmath17 or @xmath18 ) with @xmath19 gev and @xmath20 , with an invariant mass between 80 and 100 gev . * missing @xmath21 channel : missing transverse momentum@xmath22gev . * semi - leptonic channel : missing transverse momentum@xmath23gev plus a lepton ( @xmath17 or @xmath18 ) with @xmath24gev .",
    "veto event if there is jet with @xmath19 gev and @xmath25 .",
    "* all channel : no more lepton with @xmath19 gev and @xmath20 except to reconstruct the vector boson , no more b - tagged jets with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    the mass spectrum of the higgs candidate with @xmath26115 gev is shown in fig  [ fig : mass ] for the three sub - channel and combined channel .",
    "the number of both signal and background for higgs mass between 112 - 128 gev for 30@xmath3 data is shown in table  [ tab : all ] , the significance is 4.5 @xmath4(8.2@xmath4 for 100 @xmath3 ) .",
    "the result is comparable to  @xcite and offer an alternative strategy for search for boosted higgs .    .",
    "on the top , the left plot is or leptonic channel and the right plot is for missing et channel . on the bottom , the left plot is for semi - leptonic channel and the right plot is the total signal and background for all the channel .",
