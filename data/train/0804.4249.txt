    "composite nanostructures comprised of alternating metal and dielectric constituents such as , e.g. , bimetallic spherical particles , metal nanoshells,@xcite nanorice,@xcite , and structures with more than two constituents ( nano - matryoshka)@xcite , are among the highlights of nanomaterials with versatile optical and mechanical properties .",
    "similar to solid metal nanoparticles , the absorption and scattering of light by composite nanostructures are dominated by the surface plasmon resonance ( spr ) .",
    "these structures offer new possibilities for various applications due to tunability of their optical properties which can be controlled during the manufacturing process by varying constituent materials or geometry.@xcite for example , by changing shell thickness , the spr position in nanoshells and bimetallic particles can be changed in wide frequency range .",
    "recent measurements on single nanoshells@xcite indicated enhanced sensitivity of their scattering spectra to the environment , while the spr redshift resulted in a narrowing of their resonance lineshape as compared to solid gold particles.@xcite these unique optical characteristics of composite structures spurred numerous proposals for various applications , e.g. , in optomechanics,@xcite sensing,@xcite drug delivery@xcite and phototherapy.@xcite    while the optical response of core - shell nanostructures has been extensively studied , much less is known about their acoustical properties.@xcite in fact , the low frequency vibrational modes of composite nanoparticles bear a unique signature of their structural and mechanical characteristics directly reflecting the impact of confinement on the ionic movement.@xcite this is in contrast to the optical response which is mainly determined by electronic excitations .",
    "thus the vibrational modes constitute an additional source of information that is particularly important for hybrid or layered systems with structurally distinct constituents , such as , e.g. , bimetallic nanoparticles and nanoshells .",
    "recent pump - probe spectroscopy measurements of fundamental ( breathing ) mode frequency and damping in bimetallic particles @xcite and gold nanoshells @xcite revealed significantly different , from solid nanoparticles , acoustical signature that could be used as a tool complimentary to optical methods .    in this paper",
    "we study the spectrum of radial vibrational modes of core - shell nanoparticles , including metal nanoshells with dielectric core and bimetallic spherical particles , embedded in an environment .",
    "acoustic vibrational modes in nanoparticles can be impulsively launched by a laser pulse and monitored using the pump - probe spectroscopic technique.@xcite after initial stage of rapid expansion , the nanoparticle undergoes radial oscillations around its new equilibrium size .",
    "the periodic change in volume translates into a modulation , in time , of the spr energy and manifests itself in the coherent oscillations of differential transmission.@xcite since the laser spot is usually much larger than the nanoparticle size , the initial expansion is homogeneous , so that predominantly the fundamental ( @xmath0 ) breathing mode , corresponding to oscillations of the nanoparticle volume as a whole , is excited . in solid nanoparticles ,",
    "frequencies of radial modes are inversely proportional to the nanoparticle radius , @xmath1,@xcite where @xmath2 is longitudinal sound velocity . when a nanoparticle is embedded in dielectric medium , the oscillations",
    "are damped , due to the transfer of latice energy to the environment , with damping rate@xcite @xmath3 .",
    "for homogeneous intial expansion , the higher vibrational modes are much less pronounced . with the pump - probe technique",
    ", the @xmath4 and @xmath5 modes were recently detected in ag spherical particles , while the higher radial modes ( up to @xmath6 ) were observed using raman scattering technique.@xcite    in this paper we present a detailed analysis of energy spectrum for the first three ( @xmath7 ) lowest radial vibrational modes in metal nanoshells and bimetallic core - shell nanoparticles in different environments .",
    "we find that the modes eigen - energies exhibit a strong dependence on the aspect ratio , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the inner and outer radii , respectively . for nanoshells ,",
    "the fundamental mode energy is considerably lower than that for solid particles , while the damping rate exhibits a more complicated behavior ; at @xmath11 it has a minimum , while for larger @xmath12 , the damping rate sharply increases , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the shell thickness . for thin shells , we find two regimes , weakly damped and overdamped , characterized by the nanoshell mass relative to displaced mass of the outer medium .",
    "these regimes are absent for higher modes , @xmath15 , where both frequency and damping rate are inversely proportional to the shell thickness . at the same time , the impact of environment on higher modes frequencies is negligible , while the damping rates are strongly affected by outside dielectric . for thin shells , the fundamental mode carries most of the oscillator strength , implying enhanced oscillations amplitude as compared to solid particles .",
    "however , the higher modes have relatively larger oscillator strengths and thus should be better detected .    for bimetallic au / ag nanoparticles ,",
    "we find that , in a wide range of aspect ratios , the fundamental mode frequency and damping rate are higher than those for either au or ag solid particles . for higher modes , both frequency and damping exhibit periodic oscillations with aspect ratio , in contrast to nanoshells , with period determined by the mode number @xmath16 .",
    "similar to nanoshells , for higher modes , the environment significantly affects only the damping rate .",
    "the oscillator strengths also exhibit periodic dependence on @xmath12 and have maximum values for thin shells .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : spectrum ] , equations determining the complex eigenvalues for radial vibrational modes of spherical core - shell nanoparticles and expressions for their oscillator strength are derived .",
    "the analysis of radial modes for au nanoshells with dielectric core is presented in section [ sec : nanoshell ] . in section [ sec :",

    "section [ sec : conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "we consider radial normal modes of a spherical core - shell particle with core extending up to inner radius @xmath9 and shell up to outer radius @xmath10 embedded in a dielectric medium . at zero angular momentum ( @xmath17 ) ,",
    "the motion of nanoparticle boundaries is described by the radial displacement @xmath18 ( prime stands for derivative ) , where displacement potential @xmath19 satisfies the helmholtz equation , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the wave - vector and longitudinal sound velocity @xmath22 in @xmath23th medium .",

    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 are the corresponding density and longitudinal / transverse sound velocities . in the core , shell , and medium regions , solutions of eq .",

    "the parameter @xmath37 can be expressed via the ratio of shear modules of outside dielectric @xmath38 and metal shell @xmath39 , where shear module is defined as @xmath40 .",
    "equations ( [ breathmodes ] ) determine complex eigenvalues @xmath41 of composite core - shell particle , @xmath42 being mode numbers , where the real and imaginary parts describe mode frequency and damping rate .    from eqs .",
    "( [ breathmodes ] ) , the known results for _ solid _ particles can be easily recovered by setting @xmath43 . in the case",
    "when density of outside medium is much smaller than that of particle , the approximate solution for eigenvalues reads @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the acoustic impedance of the @xmath23th material .",
    "note that for solid nanoparticles , both frequency @xmath46 and damping rate @xmath47 decrease with particle size and that the latter is nearly independent of mode number @xmath16 .",
    "let us now turn to relative contributions of different eigenmodes in the total acoustical response .",
    "we assume that the laser spot is larger than the nanoparticle size and , therefore , the initial expansion is isotropic .",
    "even so , as the nanoparticle vibrates with respect to its new equilibrium size , all radial modes are , in principle , excited .",
    "a precise determination of modes contibutions is somewhat complicated due to the fact that , for composite heterogeneous nanostructures , these modes are not necessarily orthonormal . however , since the dominant contribution comes from the fundamental ( breathing ) mode , the orthonormal set can be constructed perturbatively .",
    "namely , the higher modes acquire an admixture of the fundamental one , while the latter , in this approximation , remains nearly unperturbed .",
    "the orthonormal displacements set has the form @xmath48 where the coefficients @xmath49 are given by @xmath50 with @xmath51 , and the parameter @xmath52 characterizes the admixture . the radial displacement @xmath53 ( relative to average radius ) can be expanded over @xmath54 as @xmath55 , where coefficients @xmath56 are determined from the initial condition .",
    "for homogeneous initial expansion , @xmath57 , the _ oscillator strengths _ , @xmath58 determine relative contributions of the corresponding modes in the total acoustical response . in the following sections , we present detailed analysis of the vibrational modes spectrum for metal nanoshells and bimetallic particles .",
    "the approach developed in previous section describes vibrational eigenmodes of a nanoparticle in an _ equilibrium _ state .",
    "however , acoustical modes are usually launched by ultrashort laser pulse that results in rapid initial expansion of the particle followed by oscillations around its new equilibrium position . in the case of a metal nanoshell with a dielectric core",
    ", the latter plays negligible role and the eigenmodes are determined mainly by the metal shell and outside medium .",
    "indeed , the dielectric core is not directly affected by the laser pulse , but experiences thermal expansion as a result of heat transfer from the metal shell . at the same time",
    ", this expansion is much weaker than that of the metal , so that when new equilibrium size is established , the core is almost completely disengaged from the shell .",
    "this should be contrasted to bimetallic particles where the core does remain engaged after the expansion and thus contributes to the acoustical vibration spectrum ( see the next section ) .",
    "consider first the fundamental ( @xmath0 ) mode .",
    "for the ideal case of a nanoshell in vacuum , frequency is obtained from eq .",

    "this difference between nanoshels and bimetallic particles can be traced to the fact that , in the latter , the core is fully engaged in vibrations , leading to the interference between cavity and shell modes .",
