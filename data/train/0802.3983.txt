    "a wide - spread expectation from a full theory of quantum gravity is the possibility to fix the coefficients appearing in the conventional non - renormalizable perturbative expansion seen as an effective field theory ( eft ) . to address this question ,",
    "a necessary tool is to control the perturbative expansion of the full theory . in this paper",
    ", we investigate this issue in the spinfoam formalism , using the 3d toy model with a single dynamical variable introduced in @xcite and developed in @xcite .    pursuing a matching with the eft , while right at the root of many approaches to quantum gravity , most notably string theory and the asymptotic safety scenario , has long been obstructed in the spinfoam formalism .",
    "this is due to the difficulty in consistently inserting a background metric to perform the perturbative expansion .",
    "the key idea is to relate the @xmath1-point functions to the field propagation kernel , via the introduction of a suitable boundary state @xcite .",
    "the boundary state can then be taken to be a coherent state peaked on a classical geometry @xcite .",
    "we then expect the boundary geometry to effectively induce a semi - classical background structure in the bulk , which allows to define the graviton propagator from background - independent correlation functions .",
    "the structure of this framework is particularly clear in 3d .",
    "considering for simplicity the riemannian case , the spinfoam amplitude for a single tetrahedron is the 6j - symbol of the ponzano - regge model .",
    "its large spin asymptotics is dominated by exponentials of the regge action for 3d general relativity .",
    "this is a key result , since the quantization of the regge action is known to reproduce the correct free graviton propagator around flat spacetime @xcite .",
    "the role of the boundary state is to induce the flat background and to gauge - fix the propagator @xcite .",
    "thus the framework provides a clear bridge to regge calculus as an effective description of spinfoam gravity .",
    "however , there is more to it",
    ". indeed , if one works with quantum regge calculus alone , there are technical problems to go beyond the free theory approximation .",
    "these are related to the lack of a unique measure for the path integral compatible with the triangle inequalities conditions ensuring that the metric is positive definite .",
    "the issue is solved in the spinfoam formalism , where the triangle conditions are automatically imposed on the 6j - symbol by the recoupling theory of @xmath0 and the measure is selected by the topological symmetry of the system .",
    "thus the spinfoam approach does reduce to quantum regge calculus at leading order but improves it beyond .    in this paper",
    "we consider the simplest possible setting given by the 3d toy model introduced in @xcite and study analytically the full perturbative expansion of the 3d graviton .",
    "our results are based on a reformulation of the 6j - symbol and the graviton propagator as group integrals and the saddle point analysis of these integrals .",
    "we compute explicitly the leading order then both next - to - leading and next - to - next analytically and we support these results with numerical data .",
    "moreover , it was shown in @xcite that deviations of the 6j - symbol from the leading order ponzano - regge asymptotics do not contribute to the next - to - leading order of the graviton , but that they enter the next - to - next order corrections . here , the exact representation of the graviton propagator as a group integral naturally incorporates these deviations .",
    "finally , an interesting side - product of our calculations is a formula for the next - to - leading order of the famous ponzano - regge asymptotics of the 6j - symbol in the special isosceles configuration .    in spite of the simplicity of the model",
    ", the framework we develop here has rather generic features useful for computing graviton correlation functions in non - perturbative quantum gravity from spinfoam amplitudes , although it does not allow us to tackle the more general issue of the existence of a relevant boundary state and of the resulting eft - like expansion of the correlation functions for a generic spinfoam triangulation .",
    "we nevertheless show that the full perturbative expansion of the two - point function in the spinfoam quantization of 3d gravity is computable .",
    "we hope to apply these same methods and tools to 4d spinfoam models and allow a more thorough study of the full non - perturbative spinfoam graviton propagator and correlations in 4d quantum gravity .",
    "let us consider a triangulation consisting of a single tetrahedron . to define transition amplitudes in a background independent context for a certain region of spacetime , the main idea is to perform a perturbative expansion with respect to the geometry of the boundary .",
    "this classical geometry acts as a background for the perturbative expansion . to do",
    "so we have to specify the values of the intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures of such a boundary , that is the edge lengths and the dihedral angles for a single tetrahedron in spinfoam variables . following the framework set in @xcite , we restrict attention to a situation in which the lengths of four edges have been measured , so that their values are fixed , say to a unique value @xmath2 .",
    "these constitute the time - like boundary and we are then interested in the correlations of length fluctuations between the two remaining and opposite edges which are the initial and final spatial slices ( see figure [ tetrahedron setting ] ) .",
    "this setting is referred to as the time - gauge setting .",
    "the two opposite edges @xmath3 and",
    "@xmath4 have respectively lengths @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in the spinfoam formalism , and in agreement with 3d lqg , lengths are quantized so that @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are half - integers .     physical setting to compute the 2-point function .",
    "the two edges whose correlations of length fluctuations will be computed are in fat lines , and have length @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "these data are encoded in the boundary state of the tetrahedron . in the time - gauge setting ,",
    "the four bulk edges have imposed lengths @xmath2 interpreted as the proper time of a particle propagating along one of these edges .",
    "equivalently , the time between two planes containing @xmath3 and @xmath4 has been measured to be @xmath10.,width=113 ]    the lengths and the dihedral angles are conjugated variables with regards to the boundary geometry , and have to satisfy the classical equations of motion . here",
    ", it simply means that they must have admissible values to form a genuine flat tetrahedron .",
    "note that the dimension of the @xmath0-representation of spin @xmath11 , @xmath12 is twice the edge length . setting @xmath13 , for @xmath14 , the dihedral angles @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be expressed in terms of the lengths : _ 1,2=2 ( ) _ t= ( ) provided @xmath18 , a condition ensured by the triangle inequalities .",
    "notice the relation : @xmath19 .",
    "we then need to assign a quantum state to the boundary , peaked on the classical geometry of the tetrahedron . since @xmath7 is fixed , we only need such a state for @xmath3 , peaked on the length @xmath5 , and for @xmath4 , peaked on @xmath6 .",
    "the previous works used a gaussian ansatz for such states .",
    "however , it is more convenient to choose states which admit a well - defined fourier transform on @xmath0 . in this perspective",
    ", the dihedral angles of the tetrahedron are interpreted as the class angles of @xmath0 elements .",
    "as proposed in @xcite , the gaussian ansatz can be replaced for the edges @xmath3 and @xmath4 by the following bessel state : @xmath20\\ \\cos(d_j\\alpha_e ) \\\\",

    "the asymptotics reproduce the gaussian behavior peaked around @xmath26 , with @xmath22 as the squared width : [ asymptotics bound state ] _",
    "e(j ) =  e^-  ( d_j_e ) .",
    "the role of the cosine in is to peak the variable dual to @xmath11 , i.e. the dihedral angle , on the value @xmath27 .",
    "then the boundary state admits a well - defined fourier transform , which is a gaussian on the group @xmath0 .",
    "we parameterize @xmath0 group elements as @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the pauli matrices , satisfying @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the class angle of @xmath32 .",
    "since the group element @xmath33 is identified to @xmath34 , we can restrict @xmath31 to live in @xmath35 .",
    "the fourier transform of is then given by : @xmath36 this state is a class function on @xmath0 , but @xmath37 alone is not ( due to the @xmath38 symmetry reflecting that a @xmath0 group element and its inverse are simply related by conjugation ) . the semiclassical analysis is crystal - clear : it is peaked around the angle @xmath27 or @xmath39 , according to the sign of @xmath40 .",
    "the sine shifts the mean length to @xmath41 .",
    "these states carry the information about the boundary geometry necessary to induce a perturbative expansion around it .",
    "more precisely , we are interested in the following correlator , @xmath42 where the normalisation factor @xmath43 is given by the same sum , without the observable insertions @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 measures the correlations between length fluctuations for the edges @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the tetrahedron , and it can be interpreted as the 2-point function for gravity @xcite , contracted along the directions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the 6j - symbol , as it enters , emerges from the usual spinfoam models for 3d gravity as the amplitude for a single tetrahedron . in the previous work",
    "@xcite we studied the perturbative expansion using its well - known ( leading order ) asymptotics in term of the discrete regge action ( for the tetrahedron ) . here instead we use the fact that the 6j - symbol for the isosceles configuration admits an exact expression as group integrals , [ 6j ]    j_1 & j_t & j_t + j_2 & j_t & j_t    = _",

    "this allows us to study the perturbative expansion as the saddle point ( or stationary phase ) approximation of the integral for large lengths , @xmath47 . with respect to @xcite ,",
    "this procedure has the advantage of including the higher order corrections coming from both the regge action and the corrections to the @xmath48 asymptotics .",

    "however it is more convenient to take as parameter of the expansion the dimension @xmath85 ( again keeping @xmath86 fixed ) .",

    "let us remind the reader that the dimension @xmath85 defines the length scale of the tetrahedron @xmath106 , with the planck length @xmath107 .",
    "such an expansion thus matches the typical expansion of quantum field theory correlations with quantum corrections ordered in increasing powers of @xmath108 ( and of the coupling constant @xmath109 ) and with @xmath110 corresponding to the renormalization scale .",
    "we can thus call the coefficients @xmath111 the one - loop and two - loop ( and so on ) corrections .",
    "this perturbative expansion is obtained studying the power series expansion in @xmath105 around each of the four saddle points of both the denominator @xmath112 and the numerator @xmath113 .",
    "more precisely , we expand the action @xmath114 around its saddle point : the evaluation of @xmath115 at the stationary point gives a numerical factor , there is no linear term obviously , the quadratic term defines the hessian matrix @xmath116 and finally all the remaining higher order terms ( cubic onwards ) are kept together to define the potential @xmath117 .",
    "this potential thus contains all higher order corrections to the quadratic approximation to the action s. as such , it does not enter the leading order of the two - point function but largely enters its nlo , nnlo and so on , ( the loop corrections ) as in quantum field theory .",
    "then each term in the power series is evaluated as the gaussian moment with respect to the hessian matrix @xmath116 of terms coming from the expansion of @xmath118 in powers of @xmath85 . in general",
    "many terms actually contribute to the same overall order in @xmath105 .",
    "this intricate structure comes about precisely as in @xcite because the expansion of @xmath119 gives increasing powers of @xmath85 while the gaussian moments have increasing powers in @xmath105 .    on the other hand ,",
    "a simplification of our calculations comes from the fact that each saddle point gives the same contribution .",
    "this is a consequence of the symmetry properties of the functions involved under the transformation of @xmath120 into @xmath121 .",
    "further , for a given saddle point , the two possible configurations of signs are simply related by complex conjugation .",

    "indeed , it is a simpler application of the procedure developed above for the propagator .    as written in",

    "as for the propagator , the four saddle points give the same contribution , and the two sign configurations of a given saddle point are related by complex conjugation .",

    "<S> the perturbative expansion of this expression can then be performed with respect to the geometry of the boundary using a simple saddle - point analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the complete expansion in inverse powers of the length scale and evaluate explicitly the quantum corrections up to second order . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we use the same method to provide the complete expansion of the isosceles 6j - symbol with the explicit phases at all orders and the next - to - leading correction to the ponzano - regge asymptotics . </S>"
