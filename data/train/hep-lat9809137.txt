    "according to the theory of confinement , the potential energy of a pair of heavy static quarks should increase linearly as a string or tube of flux is formed between them . for confined representations ,",
    "one expects to see a coulombic plus a linear term for the potential , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the string tension and @xmath5 is the quark separation . for screened representations ,",
    "@xmath6 should level off at very large @xmath5 , but one still expects the confined form for intermediate @xmath5 with approximate casimir scaling of the string tension .",
    "color screening must occur for adjoint quarks at sufficiently large separation , but it is very difficult to observe in numerical simulations , at least for zero temperature .",
    "the string tensions in various representations are basic properties of the pure non - abelian gauge theory . to be viable , any theory of confinement ( monopole condensation , center vortices , ...",
    ") should thus be expected to reproduce the string tension in all representations .",
    "this point was emphasized by greensite at lat96 @xcite .",
    "the formation of a flux tube and the establishment of a linear potential between adjoint quarks at non - zero temperature have been shown by many numerical experiments in su(2)@xcite .",
    "also there are some studies for the existence of the string tension for the adjoint and a few other non - fundamental representations in su(3 ) at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "n. a. campbell _",
    "et al._@xcite reported the adjoint string tension for su(3 ) at low temperature as well . in this work with an improved action i attempt to determine precisely the force between static quarks in various representations .",
    "so far i have been able to show that the string tension at intermediate distances is representation dependent and roughly proportion to the quadratic casimir number of the representation .",
    "the string tension may be found by measuring the wilson loops and looking for the area law fall - off for large @xmath8 , @xmath9 $ ] where @xmath10 is the wilson loop as a function of @xmath5 , the spatial separation of the quark , and the propagation time @xmath8 , and @xmath6 is the gauge field energy associated with static quark - antiquark source .",
    "the interquark energy for large separation grows linearly , so one can write @xmath11 for large @xmath5 , with @xmath4 the string tension . in my calculations , i have measured the wilson loops and found the string tension by fitting the data to the above equation .",
    "direct measuring of wilson loops for higher representations by multiplying the large matrices is not feasible considering the computer memory and the running time .",
    "one may expand the trace of wilson loops for higher representations in terms of wilson loops , @xmath12 , in the fundamental representation .",
    "the higher representation states are defined by the tensor product method .",

    "the measurements have been done on an @xmath22 anisotropic lattice with @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the spatial and temporal spacing , respectively . the improved action used for the calculations",
    "has the form @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the qcd coupling , and @xmath29 is the aspect ratio ( @xmath30 at tree level in perturbation theory ) . @xmath31 and @xmath32 include the sum over spatial and temporal plaquettes ; @xmath33 and @xmath34 include the sum over @xmath35 spatial rectangular and short temporal rectangular ( one temporal and two spatial links ) , respectively . for @xmath36 the discretisation error of this action is @xmath37 .",
    "the coefficients are determined using tree level perturbation theory and tadpole improvement @xcite .",
    "( the spatial mean link , @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 denotes the spatial plaquette .",
    "when @xmath36 , @xmath41 , the temporal mean link can be fixed to @xmath42 , since its value in perturbation theory differs by unity by @xmath43 . )    to minimize the excited state contamination in the correlation functions , the spatial links are smeared . in the smearing procedure",
    "each spatial link is replaced by itself plus a sum of its four neighboring spatial staples times a smearing factor @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "projection back to su(3 ) after smearing or averaging over different paths in wilson loops is necessary , since i want to use eqns .",
    "@xmath45 in which @xmath46 should be su(3 ) matrices . for the same reason i am not able to do thermal averaging , since again it would take links out of su(3 ) .",
    "( thermal averaging is the replacement of a timelike link by its average with fixed neighbors , which is normally useful to increase statistics . )",

    "the confidence levels of the fits are not very good .",
    "results are shown in table 1 .",
    "there is rough agreement between @xmath50 or @xmath51 with @xmath52 as predicted @xcite .",
