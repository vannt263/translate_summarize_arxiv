    "to interpret the observed spectral properties of galaxies , we require models for both the production of stellar radiation and its transfer through the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "currently , the accuracy of population synthesis models contrasts with the rudimentary way in which the absorption of starlight by dust is often treated . in many applications ,",
    "dust is either ignored or assumed to be distributed in a uniform screen in front of the stars .",
    "the resulting uncertainties in the absorption of the ultraviolet radiation in galaxies can be as much as an order of magnitude .",
    "this problem has become especially acute in studies of galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "nearby starburst galaxies may be suitable analogs of high - redshift galaxies and provide important clues to interpreting their spectral properties .",
    "the observations of nearby ultraviolet - selected starburst galaxies are numerous , including the ratio of far - infrared to ultraviolet luminosities , the ratio of h@xmath0 to h@xmath1 luminosities , the h@xmath0 equivalent width , and the ultraviolet spectral slope . in particular",
    ", there is a remarkably tight correlation between far - infrared luminosity and ultraviolet spectral slope ( meurer et al .",
    "1995 ; meurer , heckman , & calzetti 1999 ) .",
    "this wealth of observations can potentially help us quantify the effects of dust on various spectral properties of galaxies .",
    "there have been several analyses of the spatial distribution and optical properties of the dust in nearby starburst galaxies based on various subsets of the observations ( e.g. , fanelli , oconnell , & thuan 1988 ; calzetti , kinney , & storchi - bergmann 1994 , 1996 ; puxley & brand 1994 ; meurer et al .",
    "1995 ; gordon , calzetti , & witt 1997 ) . a generic result of these studies",
    "is that if the dust is distributed in a uniform foreground screen , it must have an unusually grey extinction curve .",
    "otherwise , the distribution must be patchy . however , these analyses also raise questions of how to account self - consistently for all the observations .",
    "for example , the absorption inferred from the h@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio in starburst galaxies is typically twice as high as that inferred from the ultraviolet spectral slope .",
    "one interpretation of this result is that the ionized gas and ultraviolet - bright stars have different spatial distributions ( calzetti 1997 ) .",
    "issues such as this highlight the need for a simple yet versatile model to interpret simultaneously a wide range of phenomena related to the absorption of starlight by dust in galaxies .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present such a model .",
    "we begin with the conventional view that young stars ionize hii regions in the interiors of the dense clouds in which they are born .",
    "line photons produced in the hii regions and the non - ionizing continuum photons from young stars are absorbed in the same way by dust in the outer hi envelopes of the birth clouds and the ambient ism .",
    "the birth clouds , however , have finite lifetimes .",
    "thus , non - ionizing ultraviolet and optical photons from stars that live longer than the birth clouds are absorbed only by the ambient ism .",
    "this allows the ultraviolet continuum to be less attenuated than the emission lines .",
    "our model builds on several previous studies . for example , silva et al .",
    "( 1998 ) considered the effects of finite lifetimes of stellar birth clouds on the continuum but not the line emission from galaxies . here , we treat the transfer of radiation ( especially scattering ) in an approximate way , which would preclude a detailed description of surface brightnesses but should be appropriate for angle - averaged quantities such as luminosities .",
    "our model succeeds in accounting quantitatively for all the available observations of a homogeneous sample of nearby starburst galaxies .",
    "we present our model in  2 , where we express the effective absorption curve describing the global transmission of radiation in terms of the different components of the ism . in  3 , we compare our model with observations and identify the specific influence of each parameter on the different integrated spectral properties of galaxies .",
    "one outcome of our detailed analysis is a remarkably simple recipe for absorption , which provides a good approximation to the observed mean relations and is easy to incorporate into any population synthesis model . in  4 , we explore how the spatial distribution of dust can be constrained by the observations .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  5 .",
    "we first introduce some notation and nomenclature that will help specify our model .",
    "the luminosity per unit wavelength @xmath5 emerging at the time @xmath6 from a galaxy illuminated by an internal stellar population can be expressed generally as @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the star formation rate at the time @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the luminosity emitted per unit wavelength and per unit mass by a stellar generation of age @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the `` transmission function , '' defined as the fraction of the radiation produced at the wavelength @xmath13 at the time @xmath6 by a generation of stars of age @xmath11 that escapes from the galaxy .",
    "thus , @xmath12 must be regarded as the average transmission along rays emanating in all directions from all stars of age @xmath11 within the galaxy .",
    "since absorption and scattering by dust will cause the radiation to emerge anisotropically to some degree , @xmath14 can only be measured by a hypothetical set of detectors completely surrounding the galaxy . in practice , this means that equation  ( [ basic ] ) gives the mean of @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the distance and @xmath17 is the observed flux , for an ensemble of randomly oriented but otherwise similar galaxies .",
    "for some purposes , it is convenient to reexpress @xmath5 as the product of a mean transmission function weighted by the luminosity of each stellar generation @xmath18 and the total unattenuated stellar luminosity : @xmath19 @xmath20 we often reexpress @xmath18 in terms of an `` effective absorption '' optical depth @xmath21 indicated by a caret and defined by @xmath22\\ , . \\label{taueff}\\ ] ] this nomenclature emphasizes that the luminosity of a galaxy is diminished purely by the absorption of photons .",
    "defined by equation  ( [ taueff ] ) has also been referred to by several other names in the literature , including the optical depth of `` apparent extinction , '' `` effective extinction , '' `` attenuation , '' `` obscuration , '' and `` absorption . '' ] however , since scattering may also affect the path lengths of the photons through the ism before they are absorbed , @xmath21 will differ in general from the true absorption curve determined by the optical properties of the dust grains .",
    "the fraction of stellar radiation not transmitted by the ism , @xmath23 , is absorbed by dust . using equation  ( [ basic2 ] ) and integrating over all wavelengths",
    ", we obtain the total luminosity absorbed and reradiated by dust @xmath24\\ , \\int_0^t\\,dt'\\,\\psi(t - t')\\,s_\\lambda(t')\\ , .",
    "\\label{ldust}\\ ] ]    we now specify our model for computing the above properties of galaxies",
    ". this amounts to specifying the transmission function @xmath12 .",
    "our goal is to parameterize only those features of the ism that are essential to understanding the main physical effects of dust on the integrated spectral properties of galaxies .",
    "we adopt the simple but fairly conventional view illustrated in figure  1 .",
    "young stars ionize hii regions in the inner parts of the dense ( mostly molecular ) clouds in which they are born .",
    "line photons produced in the hii regions and the non - ionizing continuum photons from young stars propagate through the outer hi envelopes of these `` birth clouds '' and then through the `` ambient ism '' before they escape from the galaxy .",
    "both the hii and hi regions of the birth clouds may contain dust , and in the ambient ism , the dust may be distributed in a smooth or patchy way .",
    "the birth clouds , however , have finite lifetimes .",
    "thus , photons emitted by longer - lived stars propagate only through the ambient ism  where they are treated in the same way as photons emerging from the birth clouds  before they escape from the galaxy . to incorporate these basic features into our model , we make the following simplifying assumptions .",
    "we assume that stars form in clusters with the galaxy - wide stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "this should be an excellent approximation for the purpose of computing the integrated spectral properties of a galaxy , although it could break down in clusters or regions with small numbers of stars . in our model ,",
    "all star clusters are embedded in their birth clouds for some time and then disrupt them or migrate away from them into the ambient ism of the galaxy .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the effective absorption in the birth clouds depends only on the stellar age @xmath11 and is constant in the ambient ism .",
    "hence , we can write the total transmission function in the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the transmission functions of the birth clouds and the ambient ism , respectively . in our model , the birth clouds ,",
    "assumed to be identical , consist of an inner hii region ionized by young stars and bounded by an outer hi region . for simplicity , we assume that all stars remain within their birth clouds with a constant transmission function for a time @xmath28 and are then introduced immediately into the ambient ism ; thus @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the transmission functions of the hii and hi regions , respectively . by writing the transmission functions as products in equations ( [ tsingle ] ) and ( [ tbc ] )",
    ", we have assumed that the propagation of photons in the hii and hi regions and the ambient ism are independent of each other .",
    "this prescription is exact for forward scattering and should be a good approximation for the purpose of computing luminosities even with some backward scattering .    an alternative but equivalent way of expressing the transmission functions of the hii and hi regions and the ambient ism is in terms of the corresponding effective absorption optical depths , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "for non - ionizing photons ( with @xmath35 ) , we thus write @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 for some purposes , it is also convenient to define the total effective absorption optical depth of dust in the birth clouds and the fraction of this contributed by the internal hii regions @xmath39 @xmath40 we note that @xmath41 may or may not coincide with the ratio of the hii to total gas column densities of the birth clouds , depending on whether or not the dust - to - gas ratios in the hii regions are the same as those in the hi regions .    finally , we assume that the emission lines are produced only in the hii regions of the birth clouds .",
    "the justification for this is that the lifetimes of the birth clouds are generally greater than the lifetimes of the stars producing most of the ionizing photons , i.e. about @xmath42yr . in this case ,",
    "line photons are absorbed in the hi regions and the ambient ism in the same way as non - ionizing continuum photons .",
    "the emergent luminosity of a line of wavelength @xmath43 is thus @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the luminosity of the line produced in the hii regions by a stellar generation of age @xmath11 , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are given by equations ( [ thi ] ) and ( [ tism ] ) .",
    "the luminosities of h - recombination lines are proportional to the ionization rate , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the fraction of lyman continuum photons absorbed by the gas rather than the dust in the hii regions .",

    "\\label{absion}\\ ] ] this equation , which is equivalent to equation  ( 5 - 29 ) and table  5.4 of spitzer ( 1978 ) , was derived by petrosian , silk , & field ( 1972 ) and shown by them to provide a good approximation to the results of more detailed numerical computations .",
    "we are especially interested in the emergent luminosities of the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 balmer lines of hydrogen , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we assume that , given @xmath53 , the production rates of all h - recombination photons are the same as for the dust - free case  b recombination . this is validated by detailed photoionization models of hii regions , including the effects of internal dust ( hummer & storey 1992 ; ferland 1996 ; bottorff et al .",
    "1998 ) . for electronic densities @xmath54@xmath55 and",
    "temperatures @xmath56k , we then have ( osterbrock 1989 ) @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "it is straightforward to extend this procedure to compute the luminosity of any other h - recombination line ( e.g. , p@xmath1 , b@xmath60 ) .",
    "we assume that all the power radiated in the form of l@xmath0 photons , @xmath61 , is eventually absorbed by dust as a consequence of resonant scattering ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "we have checked that our conclusions are not affected even if a significant fraction of l@xmath0 photons escapes from the galaxy . for completeness ,",
    "we compute the power from ionizing radiation that is neither absorbed by dust nor emerges in the h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 lines , @xmath63 and distribute this uniformly in wavelength between 3000 and 6000   ( a range that includes most of the relevant emission lines ) .",
    "this is only a few percent of all the stellar radiation and has a negligible influence on our results .",
    "we now consider how the transmission function of the ambient ism depends on the spatial distribution and optical properties of the dust . a particularly enlightening way to express @xmath27 is in terms of the probability density for the absorption of photons emitted in all directions by all stars within a galaxy .",
    "we define @xmath64 as the optical depth of absorption along the path of a photon , from its emission by a star to its escape from the galaxy , including the influence of scattering on the path .",
    "from now on , we refer to @xmath64 simply as the `` optical depth '' of the dust .",
    "is sometimes referred to as an effective optical depth and denoted by @xmath65 ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) . in this paper",

    "] we further define @xmath67 as the probability that the optical depth lies between @xmath64 and @xmath68 . integrating over rays emanating in all directions from all stars within the galaxy",
    ", we can then write the transmission function of the ambient ism as @xmath69 if the spatial distribution of the dust is specified , this determines @xmath70 , and @xmath27 then follows from equation  ( [ tlamism ] ) . for some purposes , however , it is more informative to specify @xmath70 itself rather than any of the spatial distributions of the dust that could give rise to it when evaluating @xmath27 .",
    "the optical depth @xmath64 of the dust depends on a combination of absorption and scattering .",
    "if scattering were only in the forward direction , @xmath64 would equal the true absorption optical depth . in the case of isotropic scattering , @xmath64 is given by the geometrical mean of the true absorption and extinction ( absorption plus scattering ) optical depths , i.e. , @xmath71^{1/2 } = \\tau_\\lambda^a ( 1- \\omega_\\lambda)^{-1/2}\\ , , \\label{tscat}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the single - scattering albedo ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) . )",
    "is exact in the limit of large extinction optical depths but overestimates @xmath64 in the opposite limit . ]",
    "although this formula was derived for an infinite homogeneous medium , it also provides an excellent approximation for more complicated geometries ( see , e.g. , fig .  5 of silva et al .",
    "1998 , which compares this approximation with a monte carlo calculation by witt , thronson , & capuano 1992 ) . in reality , both observations and models suggest that interstellar dust in the milky way has pronounced forward scattering at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths ( e.g. , draine & lee 1984 ; kim , martin , & hendry 1994 ; calzetti et al . 1995 ) .",
    "thus , we expect the truth to lie between the idealized formulae @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in our model , the details of scattering and absorption",
    "are subsumed in our approximation of the optical depth of the dust as a power law in wavelength , @xmath75 (  4 ) .",
    "this approach would be questionable if we wished to compute directional quantities such as surface brightnesses .",
    "however , since we compute only angle - averaged quantities ( i.e. , luminosities ) , our simple treatment of scattering should be an adequate approximation .",
    "the reason for this is that , since many of the photons scattered out of a line of sight will be replaced by other photons scattered into it , inaccuracies in the treatment of scattering will partially ( but not totally ) cancel out when the emission is averaged over all directions .",
    "we now consider three specific , idealized distributions of dust in the ambient ism : a uniform foreground screen , a mixed slab , and discrete clouds .",
    "these are fairly standard representations , which may be regarded as illustrative of a wide range of possibilities .",
    "other models could be constructed for more realistic and hence more complicated distributions of dust , for example by multiplying the transmission functions derived from different @xmath70 s .",

    "we call @xmath81 the full optical depth through the slab in the direction normal to the surface . by considering sources located at all points within the slab and rays emanating at all angles from the normal ,",

    "their contribution is substantial and nearly constant across the wavelength range @xmath165 but less important at longer wavelengths .",
    "the steepening of @xmath158 at @xmath166 is also enhanced by the appearance in the ambient ism of long - lived stars with a strong 4000   break in their spectra , which contribute more light redward than blueward of the break .",
    "the absorption in the birth clouds , therefore , has a major influence on the shape of the effective absorption curve .",
    "it is worth pausing here to emphasize the important implications of the finite lifetimes of the birth clouds . as mentioned in  1",
    ", emission lines appear to be more attenuated than the continuum radiation in starburst galaxies .",
    "this led calzetti ( 1997 ) to suggest that ultraviolet - bright stars must be somehow physically detached from the gas they ionize . in our model ,",
    "the lines produced in hii regions and the non - ionizing continuum radiation from young stars are attenuated in the same way by dust in the outer hi envelopes of the birth clouds and the ambient ism . however , since the birth clouds have finite lifetimes , the non - ionizing continuum radiation from stars that live longer than the birth clouds is attenuated only by the ambient ism .",
    "the ultraviolet and optical continuum radiation , therefore , appears to be less attenuated than the lines .",
    "this can be seen clearly in figures  3_c _ and 4_c _ from the rise in the h@xmath167h@xmath1 ratio accompanying the drop in the h@xmath0 equivalent width at nearly constant ultraviolet spectral slope as the effective absorption optical depth of the birth clouds increases above unity .",
    "thus , the finite lifetime of the birth clouds is a key ingredient to resolve the apparent discrepancy between the attenuation of line and continuum photons in starburst galaxies .    since each parameter in our model has a specific influence on the various integrated spectral properties of starburst galaxies , we can gain insight into the physical origin of the relations defined by these observed quantities .",
    "an inspection of figures  24 leads to the following conclusions .",
    "( 1 ) the wide observed range of ultraviolet spectral slopes can be most naturally understood as a spread in the effective absorption optical depth in the ambient ism , although variations in the lifetimes of the birth clouds could also play some role .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the steep ultraviolet spectra of the galaxies with largest @xmath1 can not originate from old stars because these galaxies also have large @xmath139 .",
    "( 2 ) as noted above , absorption in the birth clouds is required to explain the large h@xmath148h@xmath1 ratios observed in galaxies with intermediate ultraviolet spectral slopes .",
    "( 3 ) the fact that @xmath134 , @xmath168 , and @xmath1 are all very low at one end of the observed relations and all very high at the other end further suggests that variations in the effective optical depths of the birth clouds and the ambient ism may be related ( figs .  2 and 3 ) .",
    "to explore the effects of varying simultaneously @xmath113 and @xmath169 , we assume that they are related by @xmath170 and fix all other parameters at the standard values given by equation  ( [ standard ] ) .",

    "evidently , the models reproduce well the observed relations between @xmath171 , @xmath172 , and @xmath1 in figures  6_a _ and 6_b_. they also fall roughly in the middle of the observed ranges of @xmath173 and @xmath1 in figure  6_c_.    an important result of our analysis is that the shape of the relation between @xmath151 and @xmath1 actually _ requires _ that the exponent of the effective absorption curve @xmath174 be @xmath175 . in figure  6",
    ", we also show models with @xmath176 as above , but for @xmath177 and 1.0 instead of 0.7 .",
    "these models miss the observed relation , the sequence being too steep for @xmath177 and too shallow for @xmath178 .",

    "indicate , the intrinsic scatter about the relations at fixed @xmath1 can arise from variations in the effective age of the starburst , the parameters controlling the birth clouds , and the fraction of dust in the hii regions ( and possibly the imf and metallicity of the stars ) .",

    "this recipe approximates the results of our full calculations shown in figures  6 and 7 but differs from them in that it omits the absorption of ionizing photons by dust in hii regions ( i.e. , it assumes @xmath201 ) . as mentioned earlier , this has no effect on the ultraviolet spectrum and a negligible effect on the far - infrared luminosity ( @xmath202% underestimate ) and the @xmath203 ratio ( from @xmath202% to about 7% overestimate along the observed relations ) .",

    "this provides new insights into the origin of the mean relations defined by the data and the scatter about these relations .",
    "in particular , the relation between the ratio of far - infrared to ultraviolet luminosities and the ultraviolet spectral slope in starburst galaxies reflects the wavelength dependence of the effective absorption in the ambient ism .",
    "we find that a power law of the form @xmath271 accounts remarkably well for all the observations .",
    "the relation between @xmath137 and @xmath1 can then be interpreted as a sequence in the overall dust content of the galaxies .",
    "interestingly , this relation is accompanied by much weaker trends of the oxygen abundance and the optical luminosity with the ultraviolet spectral slope .",
    "the fact that our model reproduces the observed spectral properties of nearby starburst galaxies relatively easily leads us to suspect that , with suitable adjustment of the parameters , it could also reproduce those of more quiescent ( but still star - forming ) galaxies .",
    "the effective absorption curve required by the observations is much greyer than would be produced by a foreground screen of dust like that in the milky way , the lmc , or the smc .",
    "we have explored whether this could be accounted for by a much steeper wavelength dependence of the optical depth , i.e. @xmath75 with @xmath272 , combined with a more realistic spatial distribution of the dust .",
    "we find that a mixed slab model for the ambient ism can produce the required effective absorption curve for low dust content but can not explain the observations of starburst galaxies with very reddened ultraviolet spectra .",
    "in contrast , we show that a random distribution of discrete clouds provides a consistent interpretation of all the observed integrated spectral properties of starburst galaxies .",
    "while these results were anticipated in some previous studies , we have shown here for the first time how to reconcile them with the large h@xmath148h@xmath1 ratios and other observations .",
    "we also find that the optical depths of the clouds favored by our analysis are similar to those inferred from the statistics of stellar reddening in the milky way .",
    "the model we have developed for computing the absorption of starlight by dust in galaxies can be combined easily , by design , with any population synthesis model .",
    "the observed mean relations for starburst galaxies can also be reproduced by the following simple recipe : use an effective absorption curve proportional to @xmath3 to attenuate the line and continuum radiation from each stellar generation , and lower the normalization of the curve typically by a factor of 3 after @xmath4yr to account for the dispersal of the birth clouds .",
    "this recipe accounts at least as well as the one by calzetti et al .",
    "( 1994 , and as modified by calzetti 1997 , 1999 ) for the effects of dust on the non - ionizing continuum radiation .",
    "in addition , it fully resolves the apparent discrepancy between the attenuation of line and continuum photons in starburst galaxies .",
    "we believe , therefore , that our model and the recipe derived from it provide simple yet versatile tools to interpret the integrated spectral properties of starburst and possibly other types of galaxies . in future work",
    ", we plan to apply them to the growing body of observations of high - redshift galaxies .",
