    "the obtaining of the @xmath5 pole in ref .",

    "the roy equations are one - channel , that is , are approximate and even slight discrepancy in the amplitude in the physical region may lead to large changes in the complex plane . remind that the riemannian surface of the @xmath0 scattering amplitude has many sheets ( strictly speaking , infinite number of sheets ) , and even for relatively narrow @xmath12 is sometimes a problem to determine on what sheet should we find the pole , see , for example , fit 2 in ref . @xcite . but",
    "even if we obtained the pole precisely , it would give us practically no information on the resonance nature , because it can not be connected to coupling constant in the hermitian ( or quasi - hermitian ) hamiltonian , see also ref .",
    "@xcite , because of large imaginary part .",
    "besides , the residue of the amplitude in the pole is strongly distorted by the background part of the amplitude , see tables v and vi , that gives essential contribution even for relatively narrow @xmath12 .",
    "let us dwell on the results , presented in table vi .",
    "remind that for a stable particle with the mass @xmath111 there is the pole in the amplitude @xmath112 at @xmath113 , the residue of the amplitude @xmath114 is connected to the coupling constant ( @xmath115 ) of the stable particle with the @xmath0 channel .",
    "one can see that the real part of the @xmath1 residue in the @xmath12 pole is positive , so the coupling constant should be practically pure imaginary , what is physically meaningless .",
    "note that the residue of the amplitude resonance part @xmath116 is good .",
    "that is why the best way for understanding the nature of the light scalars is the investigation of their production mechanisms in physical processes .",
