    "[ sec : intro ]    during the last seven years , compelling evidence has accumulated that gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) of the `` long - soft '' variety are a consequence of the deaths of massive stars .",
    "grbs occur in galaxies and regions of galaxies where vigorous star formation is going on ( vreeswijk et al 2001 ; fruchter et al 1999 ; fruchter et al , 2005 , in preparation , as cited in levan et al 2005 ) .",
    "some , perhaps even a large fraction , are accompanied by supernovae of an unusual kind @xcite .",
    "these supernovae have lost their hydrogen envelopes and are observed to be type ibc .",
    "this is consistent with the theoretical expectation that even a relativistic jet can not escape a blue or red supergiant with enough energy to make a grb that lasts only tens of seconds @xcite .",
    "it is clear therefore that at least some grbs are made when massive wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars die .",
    "it is equally clear that not all wr star deaths make grbs .",
    "the discriminating characteristics of those stars that do make grbs are very likely their mass and rotation rate .",
    "all currently favored models for grbs require so much rotation that it plays a dominant role in the explosion mechanism .",
    "this is true of the collapsar model @xcite where enough angular momentum must be present to form disk around a black hole of several solar masses .",
    "it is also true of the `` millisecond magnetar '' model @xcite , where the rotational energy must be sufficient to produce magnetic fields of order 10@xmath1 gauss , and of the `` supranova '' model @xcite where a neutron star supported , in part , by rotation must exist for an extended period .",
    "the energies inferred for the `` hypernovae '' associated with grbs @xcite are @xmath2 erg .",
    "if the energy is to be derived from rotation , the corresponding pulsar , in those models that use pulsars , must have an initial rotation rate of @xmath3 ms .",
    "this is more an order of magnitude faster than the fastest observed pulsars and close to what a neutron star can tolerate without deformation or excluding a disk .",
    "collapsar models need even more rotation and are favored by high stellar mass , which more readily gives the requisite black hole .",
    "so , some grbs are the violent deaths of massive wr - stars whose cores are very rapidly rotating .",
    "this rapid rotation of the inner core is at variance with what is needed to make common pulsars with rotation periods @xmath4 ms @xcite .",
    "there are two possibilities .",
    "iron cores generally collapse with high rotation rates , but the rotation is damped during or shortly after the explosion either by gravitational radiation or by the transport of angular momentum to the ejecta . or the core is already rotating slowly enough that its angular momentum does not exceed that of a typical pulsar ( @xmath5 erg s ) .",
    "the first possibility does not seem likely at the present time .",
    "gravitational radiation by the @xmath6-mode instability does not slow a 1 ms pulsar to a period of 10 ms in a few centuries @xcite and the dissipation of the rotational energy of a 1 ms pulsar by means other than gravity waves or neutrinos would give much more energy than is observed in a typical supernova .",
    "these are not iron clad arguments , but do motivate the study of the second possibility .",
    "that too leads to a conundrum . if typical massive star death gives slow pulsars , what special circumstances give a grb ? in @xcite , we showed that current estimates of magnetic torques in the interiors of evolving massive stars @xcite led naturally to rotation rates of pulsars in the range 10 - 15 ms , just what was needed .",
    "but this was for the most common variety of supernovae , type iip , that result from the deaths of red supergiants ( rsgs ) .",
    "more massive stars and especially stars that lost their hydrogen envelopes early on , had cores that rotated more rapidly .",
    "could it be that some fraction of those massive stars that evolve through a giant phase and lose their envelopes either to winds or companion stars end up making grbs .",
    "the answer is `` maybe '' , but it s not easy .",
    "there are the twin problems of magnetic torques and wr - mass loss . without compelling reasons to the contrary , one must employ the same prescription for magnetic torques in the evolution of grb progenitors as for pulsar progenitors , and the core spins down a lot during the rsg phase .",
    "second , even if the envelope is removed , the vigorous mass loss of typical wr stars still carries away a lot of angular momentum .",
    "it has been known for some time that if the magnetic torques are negligible , which is to say much weaker than estimated by @xcite , it is easy to give grb progenitors the necessary angular momentum @xcite , but then one must invoke another mechanism to slow down typical pulsars .",
    "it has also been known that if the magnetic torques are included and standard mass loss rates are employed , that it is very difficult to make grbs @xcite from any star that either passes through a giant phase or loses appreciable mass as a wr star .",
    "here we consider possible resolutions to this dilemma .",
    "all of them require rapidly rotating stars to begin with and a decrease of up to a factor of 10 in the standard wr - mass loss rates currently in use by the community .",
    "this may not be so great an adjustment as it sounds .",
    "not only does one expect some scatter in the mass loss rates of stars having the same mass , composition and angular momentum on the main sequence , but wr stars of lower metallicity are known to have lower mass loss rates @xcite .",
    "moreover , the rate of mass loss may not necessarily equal the ( angle - averaged ) rate of angular momentum loss @xcite , since the mass loss could occur predominantly at the poles .",
    "we consider two possibilities , simple helium cores parameterized by their rotational speeds ( some fraction of break up ) at helium ignition and rapidly rotating single stars that experience complete mixing on the main sequence .",
    "the former set of stars might be illustrative of the outcome of stellar mergers or other binary activity @xcite .",
    "the latter represents , so far as we know , a novel suggestion for the evolution of grb progenitors .",
    "[ sec : models ]    the stars are evolved using the kepler implicit hydrodynamics package @xcite using the same parameters for , and treatment of angular momentum transport and mixing as in @xcite and @xcite",
    ". additional discussion of the physics is given in those references and in @xcite .",
    "for those calculations that include magnetic torques , the formalism of @xcite is employed .",
    "a major deficiency of the code is that it is one dimensional , so any deformation due to rotation is not followed .",
    "all rotational quantities such as angular momentum , torques , etc .",
    "are angle averaged , and the lagrangian mass shells transport these average quantities .",
    "the rotation is thus `` shellular '' .",
    "an even greater deficiency is that rotation is treated as a passive quantity with no back reaction on the stellar structure , that is the centrifugal term is not included in the force equation .",
    "this is not a bad approximation so long as the ratio of centrifugal force to gravity remains small . in practice",
    ", this is true except for the outermost layers at the end of helium burning .",
    "however , in the most rapidly rotating stars studied here , centrifugal force can approach or even mildly exceed unity in a small fraction of the mass (   [ sec : runs ] ) .",
    "it is likely that these layers are ejected to form a disk around the star , but our present treatment is unable to follow this realistically .",
    "[ sec : rotate ]    main sequence stars of type o and b are known to be rapid rotators .",
    "about 0.3% of b stars have rotational speeds on the main sequence in excess of two - thirds times the break up speed , and the average is 25% of break up @xcite .",
    "the fastest rotating stars considered here have about 45% of break up , or rotational speeds on the main sequence in excess of 350 km s@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite estimate that this would be several per cent of field b stars .",
    "this is consistent with our expectation that only a percent or so of stars over 10 m@xmath7 have the special properties required to make a grb .",
    "the rotation rate for wr stars is not well determined observationally , but is expected , on theoretical grounds , to be rapid , at least for low metallicity @xcite .",
    "we are interested here in a small fraction of wr stars that may have experienced unusual evolution and thus feel justified in assuming large values up to and including those that would cause large deformation .",
    "[ sec : mdot ]    our results will be quite sensitive to the rates adopted for mass loss , especially for hydrogen - deficient stars . for main sequence stars and red supergiants the mass loss rates employed in these studies were taken from @xcite . for wr stars , a mass - dependent mass loss rate @xcite was assumed using the scaling law established by @xcite , but lowered by a factor 3 @xcite to account for clumping @xcite , though see @xcite .",
    "wind - driven mass loss in main sequence stars is believed to be metallicity dependent and a scaling law @xmath8 has also been suggested for hot stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite assumed that the same scaling law holds for wr stars @xcite and blue and red supergiants as well .",
    "`` metallicity '' is assumed here to be the initial abundance of heavy elements , especially of iron , not the abundances of new heavy elements like carbon and oxygen in the atmospheres of wc and wo stars .",
    "the situation has been recently examined for wr stars of type wn and wc by @xcite who find a scaling law @xmath9 for metallicities in the range log @xmath10 = -1 to 0 , with a more gradual decline below -1 for wc stars , but continuing to at least -2 for wn stars . since our stars spend significant fraction of their lifetimes as wn stars and since we consider stars only down to metallicity -2 , this revised scaling",
    "suggests that the winds we actually employed in the present study could have been smaller by a factor of @xmath11 .",
    "this would make the production of grb progenitors more likely , as we shall see .",
    "it will turn out that we are also sensitive to the mass loss rates for stars that , though still on the main sequence because their central hydrogen abundances have not gone to zero , have low surface hydrogen abundances due to deep rotational mixing . we have used wr - mass loss rates for all stars with surface temperatures over 10,000 k and hydrogen mass fraction less than 40% .",
    "such loss rates may well be too large , but the difference in final mass between stars where wr mass loss is not implemented until helium ignition is not large    the most important effect of mass loss in the present context is to carry away angular momentum .",
    "it is generally assumed that the momentum lost is just the angle - averaged value at the surface times the mass loss rate .",
    "however , it may well be that precisely those very rapidly rotating wr stars we want to consider have quite anisotropic mass loss .",
    "the higher temperature and luminosity at the poles makes the loss greater there .",
    "if this is a significant effect , @xcite has shown that the angular momentum loss might be considerably reduced , perhaps even leading to `` breakup '' in ob stars .",
    "here we consider this possibility as just another uncertainty in the mass loss rate which might again allow us to use values somewhat smaller than the standard ones .",
    "it should also be noted that the mass loss rates for grb progenitors inferred from their afterglows are generally much smaller than the standard values .",
    "@xcite , for example , determine a pre - explosive mass loss rate for type ic sn 1998bw of @xmath12 m@xmath7 yr@xmath0 , even though the accepted mass for the supernova is thought to have been around 10 m@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the mass loss inferred for type ic sn 2002ap was @xmath13 m@xmath7 yr@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we thus consider models here that , in addition to the assumed scaling with metallicity , have mass loss rates reduced by up to a factor of 10 from their standard values scaled by @xmath14 .      [",
    "sec : params ]    for the bare helium cores , a composition of 98.5% he , 1.5% @xmath15n , and a solar complement @xcite of elements heavier than neon was adapted . since we are not interested in nucleosynthesis in this study and since the energy generation rate and opacity are essentially independent of the composition of trace elements throughout most of the star , the composition enters in chiefly as a modification of the assumed mass loss rate .",
    "the mass loss rate in these solar metallicity models was scaled by factors of 1 .",
    ", 0.3 , and 0.1 to reflect how things might vary with metallicity and the uncertainties discussed in   [ sec : mdot ] . a reduction factor of 10 for example , might correspond either to a very metal deficient star of 1% z@xmath7 ( assuming mass loss scales as @xmath16 ) or to a star of 10% @xmath17 that had , for whatever reason , an angular momentum loss three times smaller than given by the fitting formula . for helium stars",
    ", we considered only a single mass , 16 m@xmath7 , which is rather typical , after some mass loss , to what has been discussed as a progenitor for the supernovae seen with grbs .",
    "very similar results would characterize helium cores that were within a factor of two of 16 .",
    "the models are defined in table 1 by the ratio of centrifugal force to gravity at the surface at the equator when the star has produced a central carbon mass fraction of 1% . here",
    "that ratio is taken to be a large value , 47% , but the ratio decreases to 30% just 0.25 m@xmath7 into the star .",
    "the surface rotational speed was 800 km s@xmath0 .",
    "an additional set of models with the initial angular momentum reduced by half , i.e. , a surface break up fraction of 26% , gave essentially the same presupernova core properties ( table 1 ) .",
    "for single stars , several choices of mass ( 12 , 16 , 35 m@xmath7 ) and metallicity ( 100% , 10% , 1% z@xmath7 ) were explored ( table 2 ) .",
    "the name of each model is given by its zero age main sequence mass , a letter indicating metallicity ( `` t '' = 1% solar ; `` o '' = 10% solar ; and `` s''= solar ) , and another letter to distinguish choices for mass loss rate during the wr stage and whether magnetic torques were applied .",
    "[ sec : runs ]    our principal results are given in tables 1 and 2 . for the bare helium cores that did not lose a lot of mass ( table 1 ) ,",
    "the equatorial rotation rate remained a substantial fraction of critical throughout the evolution . the maximum specific angular momentum and slowest rotational period was always at the surface .",
    "this makes it difficult to envision how any binary interaction could have imparted a faster rotation to the inner core than what is calculated here .",
    "[ sec : hecore ]    helium cores that lost little mass ( e.g. , models a , f , g , h , i , n , o , p ) remained nearly rigidly corotating throughout helium burning and retained a nearly constant angular momentum .",
    "it is interesting to compare models he16i and he16p which , aside from magnetic torques , were otherwise identical models .",
    "we focus on the inner 3 m@xmath7 because that is where the possibility of a millisecond pulsar or an extreme kerr black hole will be determined . because there was essentially no mass loss and",
    "the coupling between the inner and outer core was not strong in model he16i , angular momentum was conserved in the inner core throughout the evolution . at helium ignition ,",
    "the angular momentum inside 3 m@xmath7 was @xmath18 erg sec ; at the presupernova stage it was @xmath19 erg sec .",
    "the magnetic torques in he16p on the other hand transferred significant angular momentum out of the inner core .",
    "both models had the same angular momentum , to within a few percent , at helium depletion ( y@xmath20 = 0.01 ) and both were rigidly rotating .",
    "contraction to a central temperature of @xmath21 k also gave models whose specific angular momenta differed by less than 10% in the inner core .",
    "however , from carbon ignition ( @xmath22 k ) onwards they diverged . by carbon depletion ,",
    "the model without magnetic torques was rotating three times faster in its inner core and by the time the iron core collapsed this factor had become 8 .",
    "interestingly , the angular momentum of the inner 3 m@xmath7 of the model with magnetic torques decreased by a factor of 2 after carbon depletion , that is during the last 0.9 years of the stars life ,    the evolution of the mass shedding helium cores differed in an expectable way .",
    "the more mass lost , the slower was the rotation of the outer core and , if magnetic torques were appreciable , the slower the inner core as well",
    ". consider model he16l which included magnetic torques , had a mass loss rate 30% that regarded as standard for solar metallicity stars , and ended its life with a mass of 9.58 m@xmath7 .",
    "almost all the mass loss occurred during helium burning .",
    "the angular momentum in the inner 3 m@xmath7 of its core was the same as the other models at helium ignition ( @xmath23 erg sec ) but by helium depletion , it had declined by over an order of magnitude to @xmath24 erg sec .",
    "the entire star was still rotating nearly rigidly .",
    "after carbon burning and the accompanying contraction and spin up of the inner core , the angular momentum in the same 3 m@xmath7 was reduced by an additional factor of 3 at carbon depletion and an additional 30% by the time of iron core collapse ( @xmath25 erg sec ) . at carbon depletion the spread in angular velocity from center to surface varied by a factor of 5 .    in general",
    ", one sees the tendency of magnetic torques to enforce rigid rotation .",
    "this extracts angular momentum from the inner core when it contracts and spins up in the post - helium burning stages .",
    "it also brakes the core when extensive mass loss slows the rotation of the outer layers .    in those models with",
    "appreciable mass loss the ratio of centrifugal force to gravity decreases with time ( table 1 ) and is never greater than the initial value .",
    "however , for models with little or no mass loss and large magnetic torques , the centrifugal forces at the surface increase during the latter stages of helium burning and carbon burning to the point where they are comparable to gravity .",
    "this signals a breakdown in our treatment of rotation , but fortunately occurs only in the outer few hundredths ( models o and p ) to few tenths ( models g and h ) of a solar mass .",
    "what probably happens here is that the star forms a disk .",
    "depending on the viscosity , some of that disk will reaccrete so that one ends up with a star , roughly spherical throughout most of its interior , but with highly deformed surface layers rotating at break up in the equator .",
    "whether this might have an adverse effect on the rotation of the inner core is uncertain , but may have no more effect than simply losing an equivalent amount of mass .",
    "[ sec : hstars ]    in rapidly rotating single stars one has to deal with the additional complexity of a hydrogen envelope . in models with typical rotation rates ,",
    "say 200 km s@xmath0 , for the assumed mixing parameters , the star becomes a supergiant sometime during helium burning . for stars with very low metallicity ,",
    "the supergiant may be blue ( bsg ) , but typically it is red ( rsg ) with a radius of several au .",
    "the formation of this extended , high mass , very slowly rotating envelope has a great influence on the core , typically braking its rotation rate below that required to make a grb .",
    "in fact , the rsg branch of evolution was extensively explored by @xcite and , for the given parameterization , was found to give typical periods inferred at birth for pulsars .    the more rapidly rotating models , which are of greatest interest here , bypass giant formation by remaining almost completely mixed on the main sequence .",
    "thus , at the end , they resemble the helium cores of the previous section .",
    "an interesting exemplary case is model 16ti .",
    "this star rotated at about 400 km s@xmath0 on the main sequence and became a wr star shortly after central h depletion . because of its assumed low metallicity , 1% solar and mass loss scaling ( @xmath26 ) , mass loss on the main sequence was negligible and mass loss as a wr star was reduced by 10 compared to solar metallicity stars . in this particular model",
    "the mass loss was decreased by an additional factor of 3 to explore the consequences .",
    "the final mass of the 16 solar mass star was 13.95 m@xmath7 .",
    "it was a wo star with surface abundances 40% c , 40%o , and 20% he .",
    "most of the presupernova star was predominantly oxygen and heavier elements    again focusing on the angular momentum in the inner 3 m@xmath7 ( see also fig .",
    "1 ) , the angular momentum when the star had burned about half of its hydrogen ( x@xmath20 = 0.40 was @xmath27 erg sec .",
    "this declined by about 20% at central hydrogen depletion and by about a factor of 4 at helium ignition .",
    "this large decrease was caused by core contraction and spin up coupled to the outer layers by magnetic torques .",
    "half way though helium burning the angular momentum in the inner 3 m@xmath7 had increased back to @xmath28 erg s owing to extensive convection redistributing angular momentum in the core .",
    "this decreased to @xmath29 erg sec when the central temperature was @xmath21 k and to @xmath30 erg sec at carbon depletion .",
    "in marked contrast to the rsgs that make pulsars @xcite , the angular momentum in the inner core continued to decline appreciably in the late stages of evolution .",
    "after central carbon depletion , with only 0.16 years left to live , the angular momentum in the inner 3 m@xmath7 declined an additional factor of almost 4 to @xmath31 erg sec . at the presupernova stage . in the presupernova ( central density @xmath32 g @xmath33 ) , the angular velocity in the inner solar mass was 100 times that near the surface .    to summarize , for very rapidly rotating stars with magnetic torques and little mass loss , angular momentum in the inner core",
    "is essentially preserved throughout the main sequence and has only declines by about a factor of 2 at helium depletion .",
    "the major angular momentum loss occurs during carbon and oxygen burning with a large fraction occurring during the final months of the star s life .",
    "this is because of the very large differential rotation developed by the core as it contracts through these advanced burning stages and the effect of magnetic torques which try to maintain rigid rotation .    like the helium cores , some of these rapidly rotating stars also develop centrifugally supported surfaces . in the case of model 16ti ,",
    "centrifugal forces exceed gravity at the equator during helium shell burning , though only in the outer 0.1 m@xmath7 .",
    "other models to develop critical rotation after helium burning were models 12tc , i and j ; 16 tb , c , and j ; 12oc , j , and n ; and 16oc , j , m , and n. none of the solar metallicity calculations or 35 m@xmath7 stars developed critical rotation .",
    "[ sec : bestar ]    oe and be stars are a subclass of massive stars that show emission lines , usually taken to be indicative of a disk @xcite .",
    "there is evidence for rapid rotation .",
    "indeed be stars are the most rapidly rotating of all non - compact stars @xcite .",
    "these stars appear may correspond to a phase of spin up caused by mass transfer in a close binary system or by an internal redistribution of angular momentum .",
    "not all be stars are observed in binary systems , so it is possible that some form from single b stars .",
    "the low metallicity , rapidly rotating stars considered here might evolve through a stage having properties similar to oe and be stars",
    ". however , this would only be for stars that had , for some reason , very low mass loss rates .",
    "it is interesting though that the stars which might develop disks are the same stars most likely to produce grbs .",
    "it may be that the precursor to a grb is an oe or be star .",
    "however , the converse , that all oe and be stars make grbs is unlikely , especially in regions with solar metallicity .",

    "2 . various entries give the baryonic mass of the iron core that collapses , its total angular momentum , the rotation rate a pulsar would have if the inner 1.7 m@xmath7 collapsed and conserved angular momentum , and the kerr parameter that a black hole would have if it formed from the inner 3 m@xmath7 of the model .",
    "the baryonic mass of the iron core differs from the pulsar mass for various reasons @xcite , especially because of accretion during the explosion and neutrino mass loss .",
    "the exact relation is unknown because of uncertainties in the explosion mechanism .",
    "however , a 1.7 m@xmath7 ( baryonic mass ) core would give a 1.44 m@xmath7 ( gravitational mass ) neutron star after neutrino losses .",
    "approximately 20% could be added to the rotational period of those models that give neutron stars and not black holes because of the angular momentum carried away by the neutrinos @xcite .",
    "stars that have an entry greater than 1 for the kerr parameter at 3 solar masses would have to form a disk to carry the extra angular momentum and are thus good candidates for collapsars . if a black hole forms in these systems , so will a disk .",

    "[ sec : implications ]    one can broadly characterize the effect of rotation on the explosion mechanism by the rotational energy the resulting pulsar would have if one formed and conserved angular momentum . for a typical neutron star radius ( 12 km ) and _ gravitational _ mass ( 1.4 m@xmath7 ) , the moment of inertia is @xmath35 g @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the rotational energy , @xmath37 , is then @xmath38 erg .",
    "since the typical kinetic energy of a supernova is 10@xmath39 erg , this implies a necessary condition that the pulsar contribute the bulk of the energy is that its rotation rate be @xmath405 ms .",
    "this lays aside all considerations of how this energy might be tapped and with what efficiency . to give a `` hypernova '' with ten times this energy requires rotational periods @xmath402 ms .",
    "it turns out that stars that would give disks around black holes of several solar masses also require a comparable rotation rate , @xmath401 ms , though the relevant angular momentum is located somewhat farther out in the star .",
    "so we can make the distinction .",
    "neutron stars with initial periods of 10 ms or longer probably wo nt have a large effect on the explosion ; those with periods less than 5 ms might , and a 1 ms period is needed to make a grb .    by this criterion , all neutron stars resulting from stars that pass through a supergiant phase ( either red or blue ) and do not lose their envelopes will rotate too slowly to be grbs , or even to power normal supernovae . even those stars resulting from helium cores rotating near break up - whether formed from binary evolution , or very rapidly rotating solitary stars - will be too slow to make grbs _",
    "unless their mass loss rates are smaller than generally assumed_. this could come about either because the metallicity of grbs is quite low or because the rates currently in use overestimate the actual angular momentum loss for unknown reasons (   [ sec : mdot ] .",

    "<S> we explore the evolution of very rapidly rotating , massive stars , including stripped down helium cores that might result from mergers or mass transfer in a binary , and single stars that rotate unusually rapidly on the main sequence . </S>",
    "<S> for the highest possible rotation rates ( about 400 km s@xmath0 ) , a novel sort of evolution is encountered in which single stars mix completely on the main sequence , never becoming red giants . </S>",
    "<S> such stars , essentially massive `` blue stragglers '' , produce helium - oxygen cores that rotate unusually rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> such stars might comprise roughly 1% of all stars above 10 solar masses and can , under certain circumstances retain enough angular momentum to make grbs . because this possibility is very sensitive to mass loss , grbs will be much more probable in regions of low metallicity . </S>"
