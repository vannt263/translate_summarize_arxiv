    "such leptoquark ( lq ) particles could be resonantly produced up to a centre - of - mass energy of @xmath4  gev . via contact - interaction - like exchange of particles",
    "the sensitivity of hera extends to even higher energies . in the general buchmller - rckl - wyler ( brw )",
    "framework a total of 14 lqs are investigated  @xcite . in susy with @xmath3-parity violation ,",
    "squarks are produced in the same way via yukawa couplings @xmath5 , where the indices denote families  @xcite .",
    "two of the lqs , namely the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 in the brw notation can be interpreted as @xmath8 or @xmath9 squarks produced via @xmath3-parity violating couplings @xmath10 or @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "these objects may appear in the reactions @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where the @xmath14 denotes the hadronic final state .",
    "for these reactions there is an irreducible background from deep - inelastic neutral and charged current scattering .",
    "for lq masses below the kinematic limit of hera ( @xmath15 ) one may see lqs as a resonant structure in the reconstructed mass @xmath16 .",
    "figure  [ figure : h1lqspectra ] shows the lq mass spectra seen by the h1 collaboration using the full hera dataset  @xcite .",
    "no evidence for lq production is seen , and limits are set on the lq coupling @xmath17 as a function of the lq mass .",
    "limits on lq production at @xmath18 confidence level are shown in figure [ figure : h1lqlimits ] .",
    "they may also be interpreted as squark limits for susy models where the direct @xmath3-parity violating decay dominates or for models with squark masses larger than the hera centre - of - mass energy . for couplings of electromagnetic strength , @xmath19 , the production of @xmath6 and @xmath7 lqs are excluded for masses up to @xmath20 gev and @xmath21 gev , respectively .",

    "the hera data are searched for events with an isolated lepton ( @xmath40 ) with high transverse momentum @xmath41 and high missing transverse momentum @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath43 is attributed to a neutrino which escaped detection .",
    "susy models predict an enhanced rate of such events with isolated leptons in @xmath2 collisions , for example due to resonant @xmath44 production , as has been investigated in hera - i data  @xcite .",
    "such heavy resonances would be expected to produce an excess over the sm predictions at large values of total hadronic transverse momentum @xmath45 .",

    "an enhanced production of real @xmath49 bosons with high @xmath50 at hera may also originate from the decay of top quarks , as previously investigated with hera  i data  @xcite . while the sm predicts a cross section too small to observe in the available data , many models , including @xmath3-parity violating susy  @xcite , predict an observable rate of anomalously produced top quarks .",

    "20 events are observed in the data , which agrees well with the sm expectation of @xmath56 .",
    "this expectation is dominated by irreducible cc background .",
    "from previous searches for @xmath3-parity violating susy at hera it is known that the inclusion of as many final state topologies as possible is necessary to be sensitive to susy fairly independently of the model parameters  @xcite . in a general search developed by the h1 collaboration on hera  i data",

    "new results from searches for leptoquarks , isolated leptons with missing transverse momentum and a general search at hera have been reported .",
    "no evidence of new physics has been found , but a good agreement of data and sm expectations is found in all channels . while susy in the reach of hera can be excluded with these results to the extent discussed in these proceedings , a dedicated interpretation of the hera data in terms of @xmath3-parity violating susy by means of an extensive paramater scan of the phase space to exclude susy is still possible .",
