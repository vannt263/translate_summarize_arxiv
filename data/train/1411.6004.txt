    "one of the paradigmatic models of quantum magnetism is the hubbard model .",
    "it was originally proposed as a toy model to study magnetic properties of electrons in metals , and has become recently one of the cornerstones of quantum simulators with ultracold atoms .",
    "the seminal proposal @xcite that ultracold atoms confined in sufficiently deep optical lattices can be described by a bose - hubbard ( bh ) model @xcite , together with the experimental demonstration of the superfluid - mott insulator quantum phase transitions in such systems @xcite , has triggered the field of quantum simulators with ultracold atoms . since then",
    ", the scope of condensed matter phenomena that can be addressed with lattice gases has broadened enormously @xcite .",
    "a paradigm are spin models derived from second order perturbation theory of bose - hubbard hamiltonians .",
    "in fact , in the mott phase of the lattice gas , atoms are actually frozen at each lattice site , but virtual tunneling between neighboring sites acts as an effective spin exchange interaction . the temperatures needed to achieve such models are , however , very restrictive going down to the picokelvin regime since they scale as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes tunneling between nearest sites and @xmath2 is the atomic two - body interaction .",
    "here we take a different path to show that quantum magnetism can also be approached with mesoscopic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) confined in just few harmonic traps , relaxing significantly the temperature restrictions @xcite .",
    "the description of mesoscopic ultracold bec confined in few well potentials has been addressed in great detail both experimentally @xcite and theoretically , see e.g. @xcite and references therein . in the weakly interacting regime",
    ", these mesoscopic systems can be described within a hartree approach in which all particles share a common state ( the condensate wavefunction ) .",
    "the dynamics at low temperatures can be accurately reproduced with the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) .",
    "the simple case of a double well can be further simplified with the so - called two - mode approximation , which provides an excellent description of the relevant static and dynamic properties of the system with only two variables : the population imbalance and the phase difference between the two wells , giving rise to josephson physics .",
    "the mean field description , nevertheless , fails drastically when the interaction strength between atoms approaches some critical value ; the ground state solution of the gpe breaks the symmetry of the double well potential @xcite and becomes highly unstable . in these cases , the bogoliubov approach , which takes into account non - condensate modes , also shows a divergence in the number of atoms in the non - condensate modes @xcite .",
    "this reflects the presence of massive fluctuations of the particle number in the border of the transition regime .",
    "indeed , it is the existence of quantum fluctuations on all length scales , the most characteristic feature of ( continuous ) quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) occurring at @xmath3 .",
    "this behavior is commonly denoted as criticality .",
    "approaching the qpt , in the parameter space established by the corresponding hamiltonian , there is often a common behavior of some observables .",
    "this is reflected in a set of parameters called critical exponents that determine the qualitative nature of the critical behavior . those are independent of the microscopic details of the system , but are rather linked to the symmetries of the emerging order .",
    "thus , qpts associated to different hamiltonians that share the same set of critical exponents are said to belong to the same universality class .",
    "the qpt is also accompanied by the vanishing of some energy scale and the divergence of some length ( the correlation length ) which indicates the spread of correlations in the system @xcite .    in this regime ,",
    "the accurate description of these systems is a simplified bh hamiltonian where each trap corresponds now to a mode or site .",
    "here we associate a length scale to such systems and link critical behavior to its divergence together with a gapless spectrum in the corresponding thermodynamic limit ( tl ) .",
    "the latter is defined here as the limit in which the mean field analysis becomes valid . moreover , such description permits to determine the critical exponents of the corresponding phase transitions using finite size scaling ( fss ) .",
    "we explicitly consider other mesoscopic systems beyond the double well , e.g. dipolar gases in triple wells , and show that some of them share exactly the same critical exponents in the tl and fall , therefore , in the same universality class .",
    "in what it follows we consider @xmath4 spinless bosons trapped in few harmonic traps .",
    "we further assume that atoms might have a dipole moment @xmath5 which can be either magnetic or electric and that all dipoles are oriented along the same direction by the presence of an external strong field .",
    "bosons interact via short range potentials but also , when present , with dipolar long range interactions that couple bosons in different traps .",
    "the bosonic field operators that annihilate ( create ) a boson at a point @xmath6 are defined as @xmath7 , where as usual @xmath8 are the bosonic annihilation ( creation ) operators on trap @xmath9 fulfilling canonical commutation relations . under these assumptions",
    "the most general dipolar bose - hubbard ( dbh ) hamiltonian reads : @xmath10 + \\frac{u_0}{2 } \\sum_{i=1}^{k } \\hat{n}_i ( \\hat{n}_i-1 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\sum_{i\\neq j } u_{ij } \\",
    ", \\hat{n}_i \\hat{n}_j\\ , , \\label{bhh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the particle number operator on @xmath9-@xmath12 well , @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the total number of wells , which we restrict to be @xmath15 although our study could be generalized to higher @xmath14 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ bhh ] ) is characterized by three parameters : the tunneling rate ( @xmath1 ) between adjacent wells , the on - site energy ( @xmath16 ) which includes both contact and dipole - dipole interactions , and the inter - site energy ( @xmath17 ) , which takes into account the long - range and anisotropy of dipolar interaction .",
    "notice , however , that for a double well potential the effects of dipolar interactions can be included into a rescaled contact interaction @xmath2 and the hamiltonian reduces to the non - dipolar case @xcite .",
    "the structure of the bh hamiltonian ( [ bhh ] ) makes it convenient to work in the fock basis that labels the number of atoms in each well : @xmath18 where the fock state @xmath19 , being @xmath14 the number of modes .",
    "we exact diagonalize ( [ bhh ] ) for different values of @xmath4 and the phase space parameters in the vicinity of qpts .",
    "we first discuss the physics of the double well potential .",
    "this system can be straightforwardly mapped onto the lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) spin model @xcite by using the schwinger representation which maps spin operators ( su(2)-algebra ) onto two harmonic oscillators , i.e. two creation ( annihilation ) operators @xmath20 as @xmath21 ; @xmath22 ; and @xmath23 .",
    "the holonomic constrain @xmath24 , fixes the total number of bosons or equivalently the total spin and cuts in this way the infinite tower of states of the harmonic oscillators . using such representation ,",
    "the two - site bh hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath25 where in the last equation we have used that @xmath26=[\\hat{h},\\hat{s}]=0 $ ] to remove all terms proportional to the total spin @xmath27 .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ bbhlmg ] ) describes a `` mean field '' ising model , i.e. a system of spin-@xmath28 particles mutually interacting embedded in a transverse magnetic field along the @xmath29-direction , where @xmath30 .",
    "the double well hamiltonian ( [ bbhlmg ] ) is just a particular case of the general lmg model @xmath31 with @xmath32 , introduced long time ago in nuclear physics to study mean - field qpts and since then exploited in many different contexts e.g. @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath33 ensures the convergence of the free energy per spin in the tl .",
    "for @xmath34 , ( ferromagnetic coupling ) it is well established that there exists a second order phase transition at @xmath35 , if @xmath36 . in our double - well language , tunneling @xmath1 plays the role of the external magnetic field @xmath37 along the @xmath29-direction , while the on - site interactions act as effective spin - spin interactions .",
    "thus , approaching @xmath38 there is a transition between ferromagnetic and paramagnetic order , which in the limit @xmath39 converges to @xmath40 .",
    "the paramagnetic region is thus proportional to @xmath33 and shrinks to zero in the tl .",
    "notice that in these models , in which each particle interacts with each other , the concept of length is not defined .",
    "we aim at providing a definition of correlations , which naturally embraces the notion of correlation length and allows to link critical behavior to its divergence . with this purpose",
    "we first calculate the phase diagram of the double well for different values of @xmath4 near criticality .",
    "then , we analyze the scaling behavior of some operators and performing fss we obtain the corresponding critical exponents .",
    "inspired by two point correlations in spin chains we define correlations in our system whose behaviour properly displays the features of qpts . finally , we check if other models of the restricted bose - hubbard family share the same critical exponents and belong , therefore , to the same universality class .",
    "notice that in spin chains the length is naturally settled by the number of sites @xmath41 , and two - body correlations are given by the @xmath42 .",
    "translational invariance ensures that their behavior depends on the distance between the two sites @xmath43 , but not on the specific sites @xmath44 .",
    "the latter allows to define the correlation length @xmath45 which fixes the length scale at which all spins are correlated between them .",
    "far from criticality the decay is exponential , @xmath46 . at criticality , for continuous second order phase transitions , the decay is algebraic @xmath47 and the correlation length diverges as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the critical point .    in a double well ,",
    "such length scale is obviously irrelevant . in order to mimic the behavior of second order qpts in spin chains , we first associate `` length '' to the number of bosons , since this is the quantity that settles the dimension of the corresponding hilbert space .",
    "furthermore , this permits to order the fock states in the following way : @xmath50 .",
    "we define two - body correlations in our system as : @xmath51 where the operator @xmath52 acts on the first trap and @xmath53 on the second one .",
    "notice that @xmath54 is not equivalent to the widely used population imbalance .",
    "the latter indicates the difference on population between the left and right wells and corresponds to the expectation value of @xmath55 , while the former , @xmath56 , correlates boson occupation numbers within a well . in order to recover the `` translational invariance '' concept rooted in spin chains , we weight the correlation function by the `` effective distance '' @xmath57 .",
    "this renormalization factor ensures the proper behavior of correlations as it neglects contributions from any intermediate level between @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the general behavior of the correlations @xmath54 , far from and close to criticality , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . while the spreading of correlations at criticality is already evident in @xmath54 , it is indeed the weighted function @xmath60 the one which allows to recover the concept of `` translational invariance '' and define a correlation length @xmath45 for the system . in fig .",
