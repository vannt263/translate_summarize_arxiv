    "@xcite confirms that no other suppression factors occur .",

    "this quark may either be a valence quark or any of the sea quarks .",
    "thus , we deal with a process that may be viewed as gluon - to - photon conversion in the qcd medium .    in ref .",

    "it is interesting to note that instead of the via one may consider the @xmath54 limit that amounts to neglecting differences between light quark masses as well as electromagnetic corrections to the meson wave - functions . in this limit ,",
    "@xmath55   and   @xmath56 ,   which follows from the fact that interference of the gluon - to - photon conversion with the leading hard amplitude is linear in the quark charges .",

    "it seems reasonable to assume that the valence quark effects in @xmath53 dominate over the @xmath54-violating ones .",

    "fragmentation functions have been used in that paper to determine the collinear ( @xmath75)-terms . such small numerical effects imply that uncertainties in @xmath76 that are due to non - perturbative collinear effects can be safely neglected at present .      the fourth diagram in fig .",

    "radiative annihilation of intermediate @xmath85 states requires much more care , which is signaled by the presence of large perturbative charm loop contributions .",
    "it is sufficient to mention that changing the charm quark mass from its measured value   @xmath86gev @xcite to   @xmath87   results in a suppression of @xmath88   by around 35% ( ! ) .",
    "thus , it is important to verify what fraction of @xmath11 originates from long - distance @xmath85 loops , i.e. from those intermediate @xmath85 states that are not properly accounted for in the perturbative approach .    we do not need to worry about purely hadronic annihilation of intermediate @xmath85 states because such processes become kinematically allowed in   @xmath22   only for   @xmath89gev .",
    "let us first consider those @xmath85 contributions that are not suppressed by @xmath46 , i.e. no hard gluons are present .",

    "[ fig : rings ] where soft - gluon dressing is implicitly assumed . bringing the two charm",

    "the numerical coefficients @xmath95 are found by taylor - expanding the @xmath85 loop diagram in the soft gluon external momentum .",
    "larger numbers of gluons bring higher powers of @xmath96 .    the leading @xmath97 term in eq .",

    "[ subsec : hard ] .",

    "the corresponding correction to @xmath11 amounts to around @xmath101 .",
    "if a hard gluon is attached to the @xmath85 loop , we get a suppression by @xmath46 but need to deal with charm quarks close to their mass shell .",
    "consequently , techniques from the previous section become inapplicable . now",
    "the charm quarks can form a light @xmath85 meson like @xmath102 ( see the sixth diagram in fig .  [",
    "fig : rings ] ) whose radiative decay modes are enhanced due to its tiny hadronic decay width .",
    "the measured inclusive branching ratios @xmath103  @xcite and @xmath104  @xcite illustrate the relevance of the intermediate @xmath102 state .    according to the current conventions , photons originating from radiative @xmath102 decays",
    "are treated as background in @xmath22 measurements .",
    "the high photon energy cut suppresses this background by orders of magnitude with respect to what the above - mentioned total branching ratios might suggest . for the belle results quoted in eq .",
    "( [ belle ] ) , the intermediate @xmath102 background is as large as 4% and 1% of the signal for @xmath105gev and @xmath106gev , respectively  @xcite .",
    "it has been calculated using monte carlo simulations based on the measured inclusive @xmath107 spectra and on the rich pdg  @xcite collection of @xmath102 exclusive radiative decay modes .",
    "the same prescription should actually be applied to all the @xmath85 resonances that lay below the @xmath108 production threshold . and",
    "@xmath109 decay spectra have recently become available  @xcite . ] the corresponding background subtraction ( with respect to that for @xmath102 ) is expected to be about 6 times smaller for @xmath109 and many times smaller for the remaining ( much wider ) resonances . with the present uncertainties ,",
    "the only non - negligible subtraction is the already included @xmath102 one .",
    "the last question to be posed in this subsection is whether anything should be accordingly subtracted from the perturbative calculation of @xmath110 .",
    "all the @xmath111 diagrams with charm loops at @xmath43 and @xmath112 contribute to this width at the levels of 3.6% , 3.3% and 2.9% for @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath106gev , respectively .",
    "only small fractions of these numbers should correspond to narrow resonances because the diagrams are calculated in fixed order , without any coulomb ladder resummation  @xcite .",
    "thus , including the perturbative contributions with no subtraction at all seems to be the right choice .",
    "the last two diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : rings ] are supposed to represent radiative annihilation of @xmath85 pairs in heavy @xmath115 states , i.e. in all the states lay above the @xmath108 production threshold .",
    "here , we include not only @xmath85-meson - like states , but also rescattering of heavy @xmath32 hadrons , or charm quark annihilation that takes place before hadronization . contributions from such intermediate states are largely accounted for by the perturbative results and/or those already discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : ccsoft ]",
    ". however , non - perturbative rescattering effects in particular exclusive modes may be sizeable .",
    "for instance , branching ratios  @xcite   @xmath116   or   @xmath117   are not very small , while the available kinetic energy remains below @xmath118gev .",
    "fortunately , we have already exhausted the case with no hard gluons in sec .",
    "[ subsec : ccsoft ] .",
    "thus , the non - perturbative contributions that we are now after must be suppressed by at least one power of @xmath46 .",
    "such a suppression of the annihilation channels is not surprising because the considered states can decay to open charm without any hard gluon emission / exchange .",
    "in fact , when these states are really `` long - distance '' ones , @xmath46 is not the only dumping factor .",
    "the @xmath119 and @xmath120 wavefunctions are then diluted over distances of order at least @xmath121 , so the annihilation probability must be correspondingly suppressed . by analogy to the @xmath13-meson decay constant that scales like @xmath122 due to the meson size , we may conclude that @xmath85 annihilation probability for the `` long - distance '' states is down by @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is any of the hard scales in the problem ( @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 ) . to be conservative ,",
    "let us skip the power `` 3/2 '' and assume for error estimates that the considered unknown non - perturbative corrections to @xmath11 are of order @xmath128 .",
    "an uncertainty due to such corrections at the 5% level has been assumed in the sm prediction in eq .",
    "( [ sm ] ) , just because @xmath129 , and @xmath130 is not much smaller .",
    "this error has been added in quadrature to the other ones , so it should be interpreted as a `` theoretical 1@xmath131 '' rather than a strict upper bound on the size of such effects .",
    "actually , the uncertainty might have been overestimated because , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rings ] , the @xmath132 correction corresponds to the @xmath133 channel that poorly interferes with the leading term ; the corresponding perturbative interference has no peak near @xmath134 . on the other hand , the hard @xmath135 subprocess that might lead to effective interference",
    "is suppressed by an additional power of @xmath130 due to wave - function dilution . nevertheless , any more optimistic error estimate would need to be based on a detailed analysis that seems to be rather difficult .",
    "in this short status summary , the main stress has been put on the rarely discussed issues which , however , are responsible for the main theory uncertainty in @xmath11 .",
