    "most of the complex phenomena observed in nature arise from the nonlinear nature of the underlying dynamics .",
    "hence techniques from nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory are increasingly being applied to diverse fields such as biology and economics , where finite time series data of one or two variables are used , even when the model system remains unknown .",
    "one of the most widely used methods to quantify the nature of such data , is the calculation of the correlation dimension @xmath0 by the grassberger - proccacia ( gp ) algorithm [ 1,2 ] . here",
    "the scalar time series is used to reconstruct the dynamics in an embedding space of dimension @xmath1 using delay coordinates scanned at a prescribed time delay @xmath2 .",
    "the results of the analysis are often useful to indicate whether the nature of complexity in the data is chaotic , stochastic or a mixture of the two .",
    "such studies have been carried out in various disciplines with beneficial outcomes in understanding complex systems [ 3 - 5 ] . as examples , we mention the calculation of the correlation dimension from the light curve of variable stars [ 6 ] , quantifying and predicting the changes in the weather over a short period [ 7 ] , analysis of market variables to predict the financial market [ 8 ] , estimation of the dimension of the galactic structure in the visible universe [ 9 ] etc .",
    "the dimension values calculated from eeg data of the human brain has helped to analyze various states of the brain and its possible pathological changes [ 10 ] .",
    "the chaotic behavior of erythrocytes deformations identified through this technique in healthy people and dislipidemic patients helps in their treatments .    in all such applications ,",
    "the analysis is hampered by the finite length of the available data [ 11 ] and more importantly by the presence of noise .",
    "the former results in `` edge effects '' , producing a downward bias in the correlation exponent estimates [ 12,13 ] .",
    "the presence of gaussian white noise tends to fill the available phase space and hence increases the computed @xmath0 value of the system .",
    "this effect has been studied by many authors [ 14 - 16 ] and it has been shown that reasonable estimation of @xmath3 is possible only for moderate noise contamination . however , white noise , which is characterized by a flat power spectrum , is a particular case of the various kinds of noise that can exist in a physical system .",
    "more problematic is the presence of colored noise that is common in a wide variety of physical and biological systems , for example , in brownian motion , astrophysical systems , neurons and in solid state devices .",
    "this is so because pure colored noise also produces a well saturated value of @xmath0 [ 17 ] .",
    "however , colored noise is basically a correlated stochastic process , which essentially generates a _ random fractal curve _ rather than a _ fractal attractor _ , with a power law dependence @xmath4 .",
    "the power spectral indices @xmath5 and @xmath6 correspond to `` pink '' and `` red '' noise respectively , while @xmath7 gives white noise .",
    "its @xmath8 value depends on @xmath9 by the relation , @xmath10 [ 17 ] .",
    "a detailed analytic study of colored noise has been undertaken by theiler[18 ] , where the scaling of the correlation integral for various values of length scales are derived .",
    "also , the effect of colored noise contamination on the computation of the correlation dimension has been studied recently by redaelli et.al . [ 19 ] , who show that the increase in the correlation dimension is less for colored noise as compared to white noise .",
    "the scaling region , which is used to compute the correlation dimension is less affected by the contamination of colored noise .",
    "an important aspect of these results is that , since colored noise has a well defined saturated correlation dimension , further analysis is required to distinguish low dimensional chaotic data ( which may have colored noise contamination ) from a pure noisy time series .",
    "the standard technique used to make such distinctions is surrogate data analysis with a discriminating statistic [ 20 - 22 ] . here ,",
    "a number of surrogate data are generated which have practically the same power spectrum and/or the distribution of values as the real data .",
    "then the real data and the surrogates are subjected ( in principle ) to the same analysis to identify if the real data is distinct from the surrogates .",
    "the null hypothesis is rejected if the discriminating statistic is different for the data and the surrogates . the most important measure used for the statistic",
    "is @xmath8 , but the conventional method of calculating @xmath8 imposes major difficulties in implementing this standard procedure . as discussed by many authors [ 23 - 25 ] , the standard correlation dimension analysis is subjective since the scaling region used to compute @xmath8 has to be identified in a subjective manner . for some data , especially those with inherent noise , different choices for the scaling region can significantly change the estimate .",
    "this subjectivity does not allow one to be certain that exactly the same criteria have been used to analyze both the real and surrogate data , which is crucial to test the null hypothesis .",
    "several techniques have been proposed in the literature to overcome these difficulties .",
    "judd [ 24 , 26 ] has introduced an alternate method for the calculation of @xmath8 from the distribution of inter point distances in an attractor .",
    "this method avoids the problems associated with the scaling region , and among its many advantages is that it is particularly effective for attractors with multiple scaling .",
    "an extrapolation method has been proposed by sprott and rowlands[27 ] to obtain a functional fit for @xmath0 with @xmath11 as a convergence parameter .",
    "while the above methods have their advantages , it is still useful to develop modifications of the standard gp algorithm to address these issues , primarily due to its wide spread applicability .",
    "several attempts to improve the gp algorithm have been proposed and applied to some specific cases [ 28 - 34 ] .",
    "these include applying a maximum likelihood estimator to the slopes taken at discrete points[29 ] and smoothing the @xmath12 using a gaussian kernel[30 ] .",
    "while such techniques have given robust results for particular systems , like the human @xmath9 rhythm [ 32 ] , they still suffer from either the subjectivity of choosing a proper scaling region , or are computationally complex .",
    "this motivates us to propose and implement a modified gp algorithm which can be effectively used for the analysis of noisy time series , especially for the surrogate analysis of data involving colored noise .",
    "the main modification in this approach is to fix the scaling region algorithmically , so that for a given finite time series , @xmath3 and the saturated correlation dimension @xmath13 can be computed in a `` non - subjective manner '' .",
    "this ensures that exactly the same procedure is used on the real and the surrogate data .    in the next section ,",
    "the modified scheme is described while in  3 , the scheme is tested using time series generated from a number of standard analytical low dimensional chaotic systems and pure colored noise .",
    "it is confirmed that the computed @xmath3 and @xmath13 are consistent with theoretical values .",
    "the variation of @xmath3 with the number of data points used in the analysis is studied , and the expected increase in @xmath3 values with addition of white and colored noise is verified . in ",
    "4 , surrogate data analysis is performed for one of these standard systems , with and without additional colored noise , to ascertain under what conditions the scheme can distinguish chaotic from noisy data .",
    "quantifiers are introduced to measure the difference in @xmath8 values that can serve as benchmarking indices .",
    "as examples of real world applications , data from two different physical systems are analyzed in detail in  5 and in  6 , the main results of this work are summarized and discussed .",
    "the gp algorithm uses the delay embedding technique for the calculation of @xmath8 .",
    "it creates an artificial space of dimension @xmath1 with delay vectors constructed by splitting a discretely sampled scalar time series @xmath14 with @xmath15     \\label{eqn1}\\ ] ] here the delay time @xmath2 is chosen suitably such that the vectors are not correlated .",
    "the relative number of points within a distance r from a particular ( @xmath16 ) data point is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the total number of reconstructed vectors and @xmath19 is the heaviside step function . averaging this quantity over randomly selected centers @xmath20 gives the correlation function @xmath21 the correlation dimension @xmath22",
    "is then defined to be the scaling index of the variation of @xmath12 with @xmath11 as @xmath23 .",
    "that is , @xmath24 for a finite data stream of length @xmath25 , only a finite number of vectors @xmath26 can be constructed and hence the correlation dimension computed will be a good approximation only if @xmath25 is large . in practice , there are two other complications that hinder the accurate computation of @xmath22 . first , for small values of @xmath11 , @xmath27 would be small and hence will be affected by noise due to counting statistics .",
    "second , for large values of @xmath11 , a significant fraction of the @xmath1-spheres used in the computation will typically go beyond the attractor region .",
    "this `` edge effect '' leads to under estimation of @xmath12 for large @xmath11 and finally causes @xmath12 to saturate to unity . to avoid these effects in practice , a proper linear part in the @xmath28 versus @xmath29 plot",
    "is identified which is called the `` scaling region '' and its slope is taken to be @xmath0 . however , such an exercise is subjective , being specific to data , especially for higher values of m.    in our scheme , the original data set , @xmath30 , is first transformed to a uniform deviate , @xmath31 .",
    "note that @xmath31 ranges from @xmath32 to @xmath33 , which makes the volume of the embedding space unity . in order to take into account the edge effects correctly",
    ", it is convenient to redefine @xmath34 as the number of data points within a m - cube ( instead of m - sphere ) of length @xmath11 around a data point .",
    "this is equivalent to replacing the euclidean norm by the maximum norm .",
    "operationally this is done by choosing randomly @xmath20 data points as centers of m - cubes of length @xmath11 . of these @xmath20 m - cubes ,",
    "only those are considered which are within the bounding box of the embedded data .",
    "finally the correlation sum @xmath35 is obtained by averaging the number of data points within the m - cubes .",
    "the imposition that a m - cube has to be within the embedding space ensures that there are no edge effects due to limited data points .",
    "however , this also means that for large values of @xmath11 , only a small fraction of the original @xmath20 m - cubes are taken into consideration .",
    "hence a maximum value of @xmath11 , @xmath36 , is fixed such that for all @xmath37 the number of m - cubes which satisfy the above criterion , is at least one - hundredth of the total number of vectors , i. e. @xmath38 . to avoid the region dominated by counting statistics only results from @xmath39",
    "are taken into consideration , where @xmath40 , which ensures that on the average at least ten data points are considered per center .",
    "this makes sure that the region @xmath41 is not affected by either `` edge effects '' or counting statistics .",
    "although the criteria used to compute @xmath42 ( i.e. @xmath43 ) and @xmath36 ( i.e. number of m - cubes @xmath44 ) may not be optimal for every kind of system , they do provide good estimates for all the systems we have studied in the next section .",
    "moreover , from a surrogate analysis point of view ( see  4 ) , fixing these criteria a priori , ensures that the same conditions are imposed on the algorithm for estimating @xmath8 of the data and the corresponding surrogates .",
    "@xmath12 is computed for several different values of @xmath11 between @xmath36 and @xmath42 , the logarithmic slope at each point is calculated and the average is taken to be @xmath22 . the error on @xmath22",
    "is estimated to be the mean standard deviation over this average .",
    "this error is an estimate of how well the region used by the scheme , @xmath41 , can be represented by a linear scaling region .",
    "a large error signifies that , those values of @xmath11 for which @xmath12 is not affected by counting statistics and edge effects , do not represent a single scaling region .",
    "it should be noted that there often exists a critical embedding dimension @xmath45 for which @xmath46 and no significant results can then be obtained for @xmath47 .",
    "thus our algorithm fixes an upper limit on @xmath1 up to which calculations are to be repeated . for practical implementation of the above scheme , it is sufficient to choose @xmath48 as @xmath49 .",
    "the delay time @xmath2 is chosen to be the value where the auto - correlation function drops by @xmath50 . with these values ,",
    "@xmath51 for @xmath52 to @xmath53 is computed for a given data stream and a chi - square fitting is undertaken using a simple analytical function @xmath54 the best fit value of @xmath13 ( obtained by minimizing @xmath55 ) is taken to be the saturated correlation dimension with errors corresponding to @xmath56 . considering the uncertainties in the computation and statistics of the errors in @xmath3 , a more sophisticated fitting procedure is perhaps not warranted .",
    "a best fit value of @xmath57 implies that no saturation of @xmath3 was detected .    in summary , the algorithmic scheme first converts a data stream to a uniform deviate .",
    "next , the autocorrelation function is evaluated to estimate the time delay @xmath2 . for each @xmath1 ,",
    "the @xmath58 are evaluated using @xmath59 randomly chosen centers .",
    "the limits @xmath42 and @xmath36 are estimated and @xmath3 is computed for the region from @xmath42 to @xmath36 .",
    "the process is repeated for consecutive values of @xmath1 till @xmath60 .",
    "the resultant @xmath3 curve is fitted using function ( [ fit ] ) which returns the saturated correlation dimension @xmath13 with an error estimate . a numerical code which implements the scheme is available at http://www.iucaa.ernet.in/  rmisra / nld .",
    "to illustrate the applicability of the scheme , it is used to analyse synthetic time series generated from six well known low dimensional chaotic systems .",
    "figure 1 shows the results of the analysis for a @xmath61 points long data stream generated from the rossler system .",
    "the solid lines in the @xmath58 versus @xmath11 curves mark the region between @xmath42 and @xmath36 that the scheme uses to compute @xmath3 . in the standard scheme these regions",
    "are usually selected subjectively by the analyst . as expected , the @xmath3 curve is significantly different from that of white noise , where @xmath62 .",
    "hence curve is fitted using the function defined in ( [ fit ] ) .",

    "the scheme is tested for standard low dimensional chaotic systems and for pure colored noise , and it is found that the computed @xmath3 are close to the standard values in all cases . as expected , the addition of noise to the data from chaotic systems increases the correlation dimension @xmath3 .",

    "the level of noise contamination up to which this differentiation can be made depends on the type of noise .",
    "the effect of contamination by red noise ( which intrinsically has a low saturated correlation dimension ) on surrogate data analysis is less compared to the addition of white noise , i. e. , for the same percentage of noise addition , data with colored noise is more distinguishable from corresponding surrogates , than data with white noise .",
