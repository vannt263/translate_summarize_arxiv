    "forthcoming reactor and solar neutrino experiments are expected to provide important improvements both in the quality and in the statistics of the data . as a matter of fact , in most cases the statistical error will be of a few per cent . at this level of accuracy ,",
    "radiative corrections are likely to become important .",
    "our goal is to extimate the impact for forthcoming experiments of the radiative corrections ( see @xcite for a review ) to the process @xmath0 once realistic experimental set - up are included into the analysis .",
    "in particular we will discuss the effect of the vertex bremsstrahlung photon in experiments designed to detect the low energy @xmath1 and @xmath2 from a nuclear reactor and from the sun .",
    "a complete and detailed account of the full @xcite set of one loop radiative corrections to @xmath5 scattering , as well as a comprehensive set of references , is given in @xcite .",
    "the same corrections for @xmath6 scattering are obtained by replacing @xmath7 in the formulas given in @xcite . a preliminary study of the size of radiative corrections for a @xmath8 scattering experiment with the reactor antineutrinos , the munu one , has been done in @xcite where we discussed the physics items which can be studied in a @xmath8 scattering experiment at a nuclear reactor in addition to the neutrino magnetic moment .",
    "for the sake of completeness let us summarize a few items discussed in @xcite :    * one loop radiative corrections induce a decrease , as compared to the born prediction , of about @xmath9 , mildly dependent on energy and scattering angle . in fig .",
    "we show the relative size of the order @xmath10 cross section , weighted over the antineutrino spectrum , as a function of the electron scattering angle and kinetic energy ; * higher order corrections are below the per mille level and therefore , in view of the forecasted experimental accuracy , negligible .",
    "radiative corrections as given in @xcite are for an _ inclusive set - up _ , _",
    "i.e. _ they refer to the cross section for the process @xmath11 where with @xmath12 we denote the sum over @xmath13 final states with an arbitrary number of photons .",
    ", however , as previously discussed , the contribution of terms with @xmath14 , being higher order corrections , is extimated to be negligible . ] from now on we will refer only to order @xmath10 corrections , since they are the only relevant ones .    in low energy @xmath13 scattering experiments ,",
    "an event with a @xmath15 final state has to be rejected because it looks like a multi - compton background event ( _ i.e. _ an event due to a @xmath16 which has more than one compton scattering inside the detector ) .",
    "therefore the experimentally relevant cross section is given only by the sum of final states with an arbitrary number of photons wich are not identified in the detector , _",
    "i.e. _ , to a good degree of accuracy , photons with an energy lower than a given threshold energy @xmath17 . soft photons ( @xmath18 ) still ensure the correct cancellation of unphysical infrared qed divergences , however the contribution of @xmath15 events is lower than in the fully inclusive case .    to study the size of this effect",
    "we have built up an event generator for the process @xmath19    the cross section for this process has been computed in @xcite . here",
    "we evaluate the amplitude of the process numerically using explicit representation for spinors , gamma matrices and the photon polarization vector .",
    "namely we write the scattering amplitude , @xmath20 , as & = & 2 e g_f |u_e(p_f ) u_e(p_i ) n _ where @xmath21 is the fermi constant , @xmath22 the electromagnetic charge , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the left and right - handed chiral projectors respectively , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the conventional dirac four spinors , @xmath27 for @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the final and initial electron four momenta , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the final and initial neutrino four momenta , @xmath34 the photon four momentum and @xmath35 the photon polarization vector .",
    "we have checked that our results are in agreement with those in @xcite .",
    "the threshold energy for detectable photons depends on the detector . in the following",
    "we assume a gas detector , for instance a time projection chamber ( tpc ) , as in the munu @xcite experiment and in the hellaz @xcite and supermunu @xcite @xcite projects for the spectroscopy of low energy neutrinos from the sun .",
    "in a tpc both the energy and the topology of the event are reconstructed .",
    "therefore , the bremsstrahlung photon is seen only if its interaction point is well separated in space from the track of the electron recoiling after the neutrino scattering and if it gives rise to a signal above the electronic noise .",
    "since the attenuation length of a 10 @xmath36 photon in a gas at atmospheric pressure is always longer than 10 @xmath37 ( for instance in @xmath38 is around 50 @xmath37 ) then a photon threshold above 10 @xmath36 would be dictated only by the level of the electronic noise of the given detector .    in the following",
    "we will discuss the impact of vertex bremsstrahlung corrections on various integrated as well as differential quantities . to give a better feeling of the size of the effect we always show cross sections averaged over the reactor ( solar ) antineutrino ( neutrino ) spectrum normalized to unity , _ i.e. : _",
    "= ^-1 e _   _ ( e _ ) ( e _ ) where @xmath39 denotes a generic observable ( electron energy , scattering angle ) , @xmath40 is the antineutrino ( neutrino ) energy , @xmath41 is the differential antineutrino ( neutrino ) spectrum and @xmath42 denotes the cross section for the considered process as a function of the incident antineutrino ( neutrino ) energy .    to be as general as possible , in fig .",
    "we give the cross section @xmath43 for the @xmath44 process , weighted over the reactor antineutrino spectrum and plotted as a function of the photon energy threshold for three different values of the electron kinetic energy threshold @xmath45 .",
    "a threshold energy @xmath17 of @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath36 for the bremsstrahlung photon implies a reduction of 1.2% ( 0.6% ) of the cross section with respect to the inclusive one at @xmath45=0.5 @xmath48 ( this percentage becomes 0.9% and 0.5% for @xmath45=0.1 @xmath48 ) .",
    "such a reduction is a significant fraction of the error expected in a reactor experiment and it has to be corrected for .",
    "we observe that the @xmath44 cross section increases with the electron energy . as a matter of fact",
    "it is well known that the radiation must vanish with the electron kinetic energy and therefore the bulk of the correction is for the more energetic electrons .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .  where the differential cross section for the @xmath49 final state , weighted over the reactor spectrum and plotted as a function of the electron kinetic energy and of its scattering angle , is compared with the leading order one ( @xmath50 final state ) .",
    "the cross section ratio is shown for four different photon energy thresholds : 1 , 10 , 50 and 100 @xmath36 .",
    "the 1 @xmath36 threshold is taken into account just to show the trend of the effect ( a 1 @xmath36 photon converts too close to the electron track to be distinguished from it ) .",
    "we see that , for photon energies above 10 @xmath36 , the size of the differential cross section ratio is smaller than 3@xmath51 for any electron energy , even if a 100@xmath51 photon detection efficiency is assumed .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the effect of this correction on the electron energy spectrum could cancel the one induced by the neutrino magnetic moment because , whereas radiative corrections have the overall effect to lower the cross section , the contribution of the neutrino magnetic moment would be additive .",
    "we now come to solar neutrinos .",
    "the size of the inclusive one loop radiative corrections has been calculated in @xcite and found to be less than about 2@xmath51 for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 neutrinos . here",
    "we discuss the contribution of the events with a vertex bremsstrahlung photon above a certain energy in the final state .",
    "fig .  shows the ratio between the differential cross sections for the @xmath52 and the @xmath53 scattering ( both weighted over the @xmath3 neutrino spectrum ) plotted as a function of the electron kinetic energy for different values of the photon energy threshold .",
    "the same is shown in fig .   for the @xmath4 neutrinos ( 862 @xmath36 line ) .",
    "we see that the contribution of the radiation process is smaller than 0.1% and 0.7% for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 neutrinos respectively at any electron recoil energy for @xmath17=10 @xmath36 . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of @xmath52 events with a detectable photon in the final state is a negligible fraction of all the @xmath53 interactions and their rejection is completely harmless in a low energy solar neutrino experiment . as a matter of fact",
    "it amounts to 0.09% and 0.45% ( @xmath45=0.1 @xmath48 and @xmath17=10 @xmath36 ) for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 neutrinos respectively .",
    "the energy of the photons we are dealing with is substantially lower than the kinetic energy of the detected electrons .",
    "usually , in this limit , the eikonal approximation turns out to be a good approximation . in this approximation the amplitude for the radiative process is written as the product of the leading amplitude times the eikonal current . for the process of interest to us",
    "this implies @xmath54 where @xmath43 denotes the bremsstrahlung cross section , @xmath55 the leading order one , @xmath56 is the electron kinetic energy , @xmath34 is the photon four momentum and @xmath35 the photon polarization .    in fig .",
    "we show the comparison of the results obtained in the eikonal approximation versus the exact ones for the reactor antineutrinos .",
    "it is clearly seen that both for total rates as well as for differential quantities the agreement is at the few per mille level , _",
    "i.e. _  sufficiently accurate for our pourposes .    using the eikonal approximation we are in the position to provide a very simple formula for radiative corrections due to real bremsstrahlung : @xmath57 where @xmath10 is the fine structure constant , @xmath58 and @xmath30 are the energy and momentum of the recoil electron",
    ", @xmath59 is the maximal photon energy ( _ i.e. _  the initial neutrino energy ) and @xmath60 is the threshold energy for detected photons .",
    "the measurable cross section is hence given by the formulas as in _",
    "e.g.  _ @xcite minus the contribution of real bremsstrahlung ( [ eic ] ) .",
    "we have discussed the relevance of the rejection of the @xmath61 events in experiments designed to detect with a tpc the low energy @xmath1 and @xmath2 from a nuclear reactor and from the sun . as a matter of fact",
    "such events have to be disregarded because they look like multi - compton background events inside the detector .",
    "we have found that their rejection has a sizeable effect in a reactor experiment where up to 1.2% of the antineutrino events with electron energy above 500 @xmath36 have a photon of more than 10 @xmath36 energy . on the other hand",
    "their contribution is negligible for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 solar neutrinos ( 0.09% and 0.45% at 100 @xmath36 electron threshold ) .",
    "finally we checked that the eikonal approximation is a good approximation ( at the per mille level ) of the differential exclusive cross section .",
