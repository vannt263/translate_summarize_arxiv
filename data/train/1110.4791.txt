    "the processes of electron capture are under intensive investigation of the experimentalists and theoreticians during the last decades .",
    "still there are some disagreements between the experimental and theoretical results .",
    "one of the observed processes is the process of radiative electron capture ( rec ) accompanied by the emission of one photon .",
    "there are many experimental data available @xcite .",
    "rec is the dominant electron - capture channel in fast collisions of heavy ions with light target atoms .",
    "this process does not depend strongly on the interelectron interaction .",
    "interelectron interaction becomes important in the process of the capture of two electrons .",
    "there are two different types of the processes with the capture of two electrons by the highly charged ions(hci ) : double radiative electron capture ( drec ) and radiative double electron capture ( rdec ) .",
    "drec is a two - step process in which two uncorrelated electrons are captured in one collision and two photons are emitted .",
    "rdec is a one - step process where the momentum and the energy of two correlated captured electrons are converted into energy and momentum of one emitted photon .",
    "the processes of double electron capture were investigated experimentally in @xcite and theoretically in @xcite .    in experiments",
    "@xcite rdec was organized as a process where two free ( or quasifree ) target electrons are captured into a bound state of the projectile , e.g. , into empty @xmath0-shell of an ion , and the energy emerges with only one photon .",
    "this process can be treated as the inverse process to the double photoionization .",
    "but in rdec unlike the photoionization the bare nuclei should be used .",
    "the rdec is a convenient tool to investigate the electron - electron interaction in the processes of the ion - atom collisions .",
    "the first rdec experiment @xcite was performed with @xmath1  mev / u ar@xmath2 ions hitting a carbon foil at the unilac in gsi in 1994 . to obtain as much as possible high rate of double capture in one collision ,",
    "solid carbon target was chosen . in this experiment",
    "the probability of the rdec process is very small .",
    "experimental data give only the upper limit of the value of the cross - section of the process : about @xmath3  mb .",
    "another rdec experiment @xcite was performed at the heavy ion storage ring ( esr ) in gsi .",
    "bare u@xmath4 ions with the energy of @xmath5  mev / u have been used in collisions with gas of ar atoms . from the data obtained in this experiment",
    "we can only conclude that the value of the cross - section is also very small : less than @xmath6  mb .",
    "the upper limit of rdec process was estimated to be significantly lower than measured previously @xcite .",
    "recent experiment @xcite with @xmath7  mev o@xmath8 ions shows that there is some discrepancy between the experimental data and theoretical prediction . in this experiment ions of the oxygen o@xmath8 move trough the thin carbon foil .",
    "the rdec process was investigated theoretically in @xcite . in these",
    "works the calculations were performed within the nonrelativistic theory .",
    "the process of double electron capture is governed by the interelectron interaction .",
    "we investigate radiative double electron capture ( rdec ) by a bare nucleus followed by emission of a single photon @xmath9 the initial state is presented by two incident electrons @xmath10 with the same energies @xmath11 and a bare atomic nucleus @xmath12 with the charge @xmath13 .",
    "the final state is given by two - electron ion in the ground state @xmath14 and a single photon @xmath15 .",
    "we concern only radiation of one photon , first , because in the experiment @xcite one photon is registered , and second , since the radiation of one photon gives the major contribution to the value of cross - section of the process .",
    "we consider a scenario where the momenta of the incident electrons are the same for the both electrons .",
    "this scenario corresponds to the experimental situation @xcite .",
    "the results of our calculations are compared with available experimental and theoretical data .",
    "the double electron capture is a nonresonant process .",
    "however for its description we will apply the lpa first developed for the resonant processes .",
    "the lpa appeared to be a convenient tool for the description of the nonresonant processes as well .    within the framework of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) atomic electrons",
    "are interacting with the quantized electromagnetic field and with the quantum vacuum @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the set of electrons ( together with the atomic nucleus ) is not a conservative system , and the concept of the energy for this system needs to be carefully treated . within the lpa @xcite",
    "the energy levels are associated with resonances in the natural line - profile for the process of resonant photon scattering . in order to keep the characteristics of the energy levels independent on the particular features of the process of scattering ,",
    "the resonance approximation is employed .",
    "the resonance approximation consists of description of resonance area of the natural line - profile by the lorentz contour which is characterized by two parameters : position of the resonance and its width .",
    "the energy levels are connected with the corresponding resonances .",
    "the energy and width of an energy level are determined by position of the resonance and its width within the resonance approximation .",
    "the amplitude of the process of photon scattering ( the initial and final states are assumed to be the ground state ) can be presented as a matrix element of a special operator @xcite .",
    "this operator can be constructed with employment of the qed perturbation theory . in general , this operator depends on the photon frequency ( @xmath16 ) and can be considered as a complex symmetric matrix ( in some basis set ) or as a quadratic form reducible to a diagonal form . within the resonance approximation the eigenvalues of this matrix",
    "determine the positions of resonances and their widths .",
    "the eigenvectors of this matrix are used for calculation of the transition probabilities .",
    "if we consider the probability of a particular transition between two energy levels , we need to calculate the amplitude of this process .",
    "the amplitude is derived as a matrix element of the photon emission ( absorption ) operator ( also constructed with employment of the qed perturbation theory ) calculated on the eigenvectors corresponding to the initial and final states .",
    "application of the lpa to the evaluation of energies and transition probabilities is presented in detail in @xcite .",
    "we note that the technique developed in @xcite can be used only for the bound electrons .",
    "the aim of the present work is the evaluation of the cross - section for electron capture .",
    "this process can be considered as a transition @xmath17 where the initial state ( @xmath18 ) in case of rec process corresponds to the two electrons : a bound @xmath19-electron and an incident electron , _",
    "i.e. _ , continuum electron . the final state ( @xmath20 ) is represented by two bound electrons in the coupling scheme configuration . in case of rdec",
    "the initial state corresponds to the two continuum electrons and the final state is the same .",
    "since the initial state contains continuum electrons , the lpa can not be applied directly to these processes .",
    "however , we can introduce an auxiliary bound electron system which properties are explicitly related to the properties of original system .",
    "we can consider the highly charged ion being confined within a sphere of a large radius @xmath21 .",
    "then , all the energy spectrum becomes discrete .",
    "if the radius of the sphere is large , the wave function of election confined within the sphere ( spherical box ) and the wave function of electron ( with the same energy ) not confined within the sphere almost coincide . let the electrons have the energy @xmath22 .",
    "eigenvectors of the dirac equation for the point nucleus are well known @xcite .",
    "the asymptotics ( @xmath23 ) of the dirac wave function for the electron in continuum reads @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the functions smoothly depending on @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the energy ( @xmath11 ) and momentum ( @xmath30 ) of the electron are connected as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the electron mass , @xmath33 is the speed of light .",
    "the continuum electron function is normalized to the energy delta function . for the large radius @xmath21 and coordinate @xmath34 the electron wave function for the ion enclosed within a box is given by its asymptotic : eqs .",

    "technically , we can consider a resonance corresponding to this level .",
    "so , the lpa can be applied to any energy level of the hci confined within a sphere of a finite radius .",
    "reasoning by analogy with the system not confined within a sphere , _ i.e. _ , with a system which has a continuous part of energy spectrum @xcite , instead of consideration of a single energy level ( @xmath49 ) , we have to consider all the energy levels within some interval @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "the number of levels within this interval is proportional to @xmath51 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq080823n07 ] ) ) .",
    "the integration over an interval @xmath52 $ ] in the continuous spectrum is equivalent to the summation over all the states ( @xmath53 ) with the energy ( @xmath54 ) from the interval @xmath52 $ ] in the discrete spectrum ( if the ion is enclosed within a sphere of radius @xmath21 ) : @xmath55 } f(n ) \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where function @xmath56 represents some physical property ( _ e.g. _ , cross - section ) .",
    "if the radius @xmath21 goes to infinity , the number of discrete states in the energy interval @xmath52 $ ] goes to infinity and the width of the energy interval containing only one state goes to zero .",
    "accordingly , if @xmath57 , we can write @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the only discrete state inside the energy interval @xmath60 . thus , the transformation from the continuous to discrete spectrum results in the substitution of the continuous spectrum wave function @xmath61 by the function @xmath62 and in an additional factor @xmath63 to the function @xmath56 ( cross - section ) , where @xmath60 is the distance between the nearest energy levels .",
