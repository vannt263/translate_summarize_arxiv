    "g. stokes studied the polarization properties of a quasi - monochromatic plane wave of light in an arbitrary polarization state by introducing four quantities , known since then as the stokes parameters @xcite .",
    "the stokes parameters are a set of four quantities which provide intuitive and practical tools to describe the polarization of light @xcite .",
    "the stokes parameters give a direct relation between the light ( photons ) polarization and the polarization of elementary particles @xcite .",
    "this fact was widely exploited to study many features of radiation of particles and to the scattering problems @xcite .",
    "the stokes parameters are formulated in terms of the observables of the electromagnetic field , namely , the amplitudes and the relative phase difference between the orthogonal components of the field @xcite .",
    "in fact , the density matrix @xcite and the coherence matrix @xcite for the case of electromagnetic radiation result to be the same @xcite , and are written in terms of these observables .    the standard procedure to describe the polarization of an electromagnetic wave is to set the propagation direction along the @xmath1-axis , and the two components of the polarization field on the @xmath6 and @xmath7directions .",
    "however , when the direction of arrival from the source is unknown a priori , the three - dimensional coherence matrix must be used to obtain a complete polarization characterization @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , jauch and rohrlich introduced the stokes parameters in the quantum regime , which are called stokes operators .",
    "it is at the quantum domain where we can see that a symmetry group structure is related to the stokes operators . when the direction of propagation of light is known , the symmetry is the @xmath8 group @xcite",
    "however , when the direction of propagation is unknown , the symmetry group is @xmath9 @xcite . also , other generalizations of stokes operators have been reported @xcite .    in this work",
    "we give a new approach to the theory of light polarization . for simplicity , we study the case of a monochromatic plane electromagnetic wave which propagates along the @xmath1-axis .",
    "our study is based on a set of quantum operators , constructed from two independent bosons , being three of them the @xmath0 lie algebra generators , and the other one , the casimir operator of this algebra .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we deduce the @xmath0 lie algebra generators by the jordan - schwinger map . in section 3 , by taking the expectation value of the algebra generators in a two - mode coherent state , we obtain their classical limit . in section 4 , we define our stokes parameters ( we refer to them stokes - like parameters ) and show that the light polarization ellipse can be written in terms of them . in section 5 , the stokes - like parameters are written in terms of two parameters and it is shown that they define a one - sheet ( poincar hyperboloid ) of a two - sheet hyperboloid .",
    "in what follows we will use @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the mass of each one - dimensional harmonic oscillator and @xmath12 is the frequency of either the electromagnetic wave or the harmonic oscillators .",
    "we define the operators @xmath13 with @xmath14 the operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 the left and right annihilation operators of the two - dimensional harmonic oscillator , with the non vanishing commutators @xmath17=[a_2,a_2^{\\dag}]=1 $ ] .",
    "the matrices @xmath18 are defined as follows : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 are the usual pauli matrices @xcite .",
    "+ explicitly , the operators @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are given by @xmath28 the operator @xmath24 can be rewritten as @xmath29 , being @xmath30 the @xmath31component of the angular momentum of the two - dimensional harmonic oscillator , whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , the operator @xmath27 is essentially the energy of the two - dimensional harmonic oscillator .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath33=0 , \\hspace{2ex}\\ ] ] also , by a straightforward calculation , we show that the commutation relations of the operators @xmath34 are @xmath35=-i \\mathcal{k}_3,\\hspace{3ex } \\left[\\mathcal{k}_2,\\mathcal{k}_3\\right]=i \\mathcal{k}_1 , \\hspace{3ex } \\left[\\mathcal{k}_3,\\mathcal{k}_1\\right]=i \\mathcal{k}_3 . \\label{comu}\\ ] ] therefore , these operators close the @xmath0 lie algebra . the casimir operator @xmath36 for this algebra results to be @xmath37 .",
    "hence , we have obtained the generators of the @xmath0 lie algebra , equation ( [ jsm ] ) , by the so called jordan - schwinger map @xcite .",
    "in ref . @xcite the classical states of the two - dimensional harmonic oscillator were calculated . on the other hand ,",
    "the stokes parameters were obtained by evaluating the @xmath38 lie algebra generators in a two - mode coherent state @xcite .",
    "the same idea was used to derive one of the stokes parameters generalizations by evaluating the @xmath39 lie algebra generators in a three - mode coherent states @xcite . in this paper",
    "we take advantage of these facts .",
    "thus , we evaluate the @xmath0 lie algebra generators @xmath40 in a two - mode coherent state to obtain their classical limit . the two - mode coherent states are well known to be given by @xmath41}\\sum_{n_1,n_2=0}^\\infty{\\alpha_1^{n_1}\\alpha_2^{n_2 } \\over \\sqrt{n_1!n_2!}}|n_1,n_2\\rangle,\\label{tm}\\ ] ] which are eigenstates of the annihilation operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath42 with this procedure , we obtain @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the classical oscillations @xmath45 $ ] with amplitudes @xmath46 and phases @xmath47 .",
    "this leads to @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the classical limit of the lie algebra generators in a time - dependent two - mode coherent state is time dependent .",
    "this is because the @xmath0 lie algebra generators do not commute with the hamiltonian of the two - dimensional harmonic oscillator .",
    "it is well known that the standard stokes parameters obtained as the classical limit of the @xmath38 generators are time - independent @xcite .",
    "this is due to the @xmath38 lie algebra generators commute with the two - dimensional harmonic oscillator hamiltonian .",
    "we set an electromagnetic wave with arbitrary polarization , which propagates along the @xmath1-axis , given by @xmath50 where the complex amplitudes are defined by @xmath51}$ ] .",
    "it can be written in the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 from these equations is easy to obtain the nonparametric quadratic equation @xmath55 by setting the definitions @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , it is shown that @xmath59 .",
    "thus , when @xmath60 , equation ( [ trayec ] ) represents an ellipse centered at the origin . equations ( [ campo1 ] ) and ( [ campo2 ] ) allows to write equation ( [ trayec ] ) as @xmath61 this is the polarization ellipse described by the plane wave electromagnetic field . using equations ( [ funda1 ] ) and ( [ funda2 ] ) , and the definition of the phase difference @xmath62 , this equation can be rewritten as @xmath63 in this way we have written the polarization ellipse in terms of the classical values of the @xmath0 lie algebra generators .",
    "+ we define the classical stokes - like parameters @xmath64 as follows @xmath65 thus , the ellipse polarization can be expressed as @xmath66 we note that the polarization ellipse , equation ( [ elipse ] ) , depends on the phase difference @xmath67 , whereas the classical limit of the @xmath0 generators do not .",
    "this fact has forced us to define the stokes - like parameters as those of equations ( [ stokes1 ] ) and ( [ stokes2 ] ) , which depends on the phase difference and are time - independent .",
    "the procedure to map the standard stokes parameters to the poincar sphere is explained in full detail in sec .",
    "1.4.2 of ref . @xcite . in the present section ,",
    "we translate the born and wolf ideas to our stokes - like parameters .",
    "we shall show that they are mapped to a one - sheet of a two - sheet hyperbolic paraboloid .",
    "we perform an hyperbolic rotation to the fields @xmath68 and @xmath69 by an angle @xmath70 , in such a way that the fields @xmath71 and @xmath72 are obtained on the principal axis of the ellipse .",
    "thus , @xmath73 equation ( [ campo ] ) can be written as @xmath74 where @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "+ on the other hand , the oscillations on the principal axis of the ellipse are given by @xmath78 being @xmath79 a constant phase .",

    "this equation leads to @xmath99 or depending on the sign of the @xmath100 : @xmath101 similarly , from equations ( [ funda3 ] ) , ( [ funda1 ] ) , ( [ funda2 ] ) , and ( [ stokes2 ] ) , we can show that @xmath102 on the other hand , from equations ( [ funda1 ] ) and ( [ funda2 ] ) it is immediate to show that @xmath103 where for the last equality we have used equations ( [ stokes1 ] ) and ( [ stokes2 ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ tild1 ] ) , ( [ tild2 ] ) and ( [ forc ] ) lead to @xmath104 however , because of equation ( [ stokes2 ] ) , @xmath105 , thus @xmath106 substituting this equation into equation ( [ tild2 ] ) we have @xmath107    equations ( [ tild1 ] ) , ( [ tild3 ] ) and ( [ tild4 ] ) are the stokes - like parameters written in terms of @xmath108 and @xmath70 .",
    "we have plotted the vector function @xmath109 with the different setting of signs : a ) ( + , + , + ) , b ) ( + , ,+ ) , c ) ( ,+,+ ) and d ) ( ,,+ ) .",
    "it must be emphasized that for each of these setting , the polarization surface generated for the stokes - like parameters results to be as that shown in fig . 1 , been @xmath110 the distance from the origin of coordinates to the minimum of the hyperboloid sheet .",
    "hence , because of the plus sign in equation ( [ tild3 ] ) , the stokes - like parameters generate a one - sheet ( poincar hyperboloid ) of a two - sheet hyperboloid , instead an sphere . fig .",
