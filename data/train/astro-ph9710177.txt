    "in a previous paper ( boller et al .  1992a ) we presented results of a first correlation between the rosat all - sky survey and the 14,708 extragalactic sources selected from the iras point source catalogue ( hereafter iras psc ) .",
    "this initial correlation used the first processing of the all - sky survey data by the standard analysis software system ( rass  i ) ( voges et al .",
    "1996a ; downes et al .",
    "1994 ) and resulted in a sample of 244 objects . from the distribution of source separations ( see fig .  4 of boller et al .",
    "1992a ) the number fraction of spurious sources herein was estimated to about 16@xmath0 .",
    "recently , a second processing of the rosat all - sky survey ( rass  ii ) was performed that yielded about 120,000 sources with detection likelihoods larger 8 ( cf .",
    "cruddace et al . (",
    "1988 ) for the definition of the detection likelihood ) .",
    "the major differences of the second processing as compared with the first are : ( i ) the photons were not collected in strips but merged in 1378 sky - fields of 6.4@xmath16.4 degree , which takes full advantage of the increasing exposure towards the ecliptic poles ; ( ii ) neighboring fields overlap by at least 0.23 degree in order to ensure the detection of sources at the field boundaries , which posed a problem in the first processing ; ( iii ) a new aspect solution reduces the number of sources with erroneous positions and morphology .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of a correlation of the 14,315 iras galaxies with the rass  ii source list .",
    "jy ] iras galaxies .",
    "these objects are excluded by the multivariate selection technique ( cf . adorf & meurs 1988 ; boller et al .",
    "1992b ; sect . 2 of boller et al .",
    "1992a ) ; however their rass  i spatially correlated sources are included in our first correlation . ] for consistency we have still taken the iras psc sources , but use whenever available the iras fsc position and fluxes instead of the iras psc positions and fluxes . section  2 describes how the x - ray emitting iras galaxies were identified through a spatial correlation , and a subsequent superposition of x - ray emission contours on optical images .",
    "we adopted a classification scheme to characterize the likelihood that the infrared and x - ray emission originate from the same object .",
    "thereby we obtained a list of iras galaxies with a very high probability of detected x - ray emission .",
    "their soft x - ray spectral properties were analyzed and compared with their infrared emission in sect .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present the basic data and to quantify the likelihood that the x - rays we measure are associated with the iras galaxy . in subsequent papers we shall present results of optical follow - up observations of our galaxy sample and of theoretical models addressing the x - ray and far - infrared emission of galaxies in different states of nuclear activity .",
    "the images for the 372 potential identifications and the tables 3 to 5 of the paper are available as postscript files from http://www.rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de/ ~  bol / iras_rassii or can be retrieved via anonymous ftp from ftp.rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de in the subdirectories /outgoing / bol / iras_rassii / images and /outgoing / bol / iras_rassii / tables , respectively .",
    "our rass  ii source catalogue only includes sources with a detection likelihood larger than eight . in addition",
    ", the number of source photons in the ( 0.1@xmath22.4 kev ) energy band must be larger than six .",
    "the latter restriction is obtained from an analysis of the distribution of detection likelihood values versus the ratio of source to background count rates .",
    "sources with five or less source photons show unusually high source to background count ratios for their values of the detection likelihood , compared to sources with a higher detection likelihood . this may be due to uncertainties in the standard analysis software analysis of weak sources . to avoid the uncertainties introduced by the sass detection algorithm we therefore require the number of source photons to be above some threshold .",
    "the rass  ii source catalogue thereby constrained has 116,471 sources .    through a correlation of the positions of 14,315 iras galaxies with 116,471 rass  ii source positions we obtained a list of 372 possible identifications .",
    "because of its superior positional accuracy , when available we used the iras fsc position instead of the iras psc position .",
    "table 2 lists the corresponding fsc and psc names for such objects .    in sect .",
    "2.1 we estimate the number of chance coincidences among our correlated iras and rass  ii sources , as well as the dependence of that number on the positional uncertainty of the rass  ii source positions .    in a second step ( sect .",
    "2.2 ) the candidate identifications were individually examined through superimposing the x - ray emission contours on optical images taken from the palomar digitized sky survey . in these images",
    "we also show the iras 3 @xmath3 error ellipse .",
    "all objects were classified according to how clearly the x - rays appear to originate from the optical counterpart of the respective iras source .",
    "this section describes our first identification step , a search for rass  ii sources within 5 arcmin around each of the 14,315 iras galaxies .",
    "we estimate the chance coincidence rate and its dependence on the positional identification uncertainty .      from two random sets of @xmath4 = 14,315 and @xmath5",
    "= 116,471 sources we expect @xmath6 chance pairs with an angular separation less than @xmath7 , where @xmath7 is measured in arcsec . within a separation of 100 arcsec",
    "we therefore expect 98 chance coincidences , which account for one quarter of the source pairs we found .    to empirically verify this number of chance coincidences we re - correlated the iras galaxy positions five times with rass  ii positions that were offset by @xmath830 arcmin in right ascension and/or declination .",
    "the number of chance coincidences of separation less than 100 arcsec turned out to be 101 ( @xmath9 ) , 105 ( @xmath10 ) , 113 ( @xmath11 . ) , 105 ( @xmath12 ) , 102 ( @xmath9 , @xmath12 ) .",
    "the slightly higher number of pairs in the test correlations may be due to an excess of correlation below about 150 arcsec separations that we attribute to a wider spatial correlation between diffuse cluster x - ray emission and the infrared emission from galaxies within the clusters ( see the discussion in the following section ) .",
    "the number distribution of pairs drawn from two randomly distributed sets of @xmath13 and @xmath14 objects , respectively , should follow @xmath15 a least square fit to the average distribution up to 300 arcsec of our five test correlations ( cf .",
    "1b ) yields @xmath16 , which corresponds to @xmath17 , in fair agreement with the expected value of @xmath18 .",
    "we searched for rass  ii counterparts within a radius of 5 arcmin around the position of each of the 14,315 iras galaxies and found 372 possible identifications .",
    "1a shows the distribution of distances between the infrared position and its nearest x - ray source .",
    "in contrast to the distribution of random associations displayed in fig . 1b , the actual correlation of the two catalogues shows a strong excess of source pairs within about 50 arcsec .",
    "of the 372 pairs within 100 arcsec the expected number of chance coincidences is 105 , with an uncertainty estimated from the different x - ray catalogue offsets of about @xmath8 8 .",
    "thus statistically , we should have found about 267 iras sources with x - ray emission in their actual vicinity .",
    "the width of the distribution of  real \" source pair   separations arises from positional uncertainties in each catalogue , resulting in a gaussian distribution with some angular width @xmath3 .",
    "we therefore model the observed distribution as the sum of @xmath19  real \" pairs , and a background characterized by the total number , @xmath20 , of pairs in two sets of randomly distributed objects : @xmath21 a least square fit to the observed distribution yields @xmath22 arcsec and @xmath23 ( we have fixed the value of @xmath24 to that obtained from the distribution of fig .",
    "1b ) . our visual inspection ( cf .",
    "2.3 and our overlays ) of all 372 pairs resulted in 197 secure identification of x - ray emitting iras galaxies , a number in good agreement with the 204 objects attributed to the central gaussian of the pair distribution function .",
    "the number of 204 sources we attribute to the central gaussian is smaller than the total number of pairs to 100 arcsec minus the expected random pairs , 372 - 105 = 267 .",
    "this is probably due to another excess above the expected random distribution and outside the central gaussian peak , reaching out to about 150 arcsec ( cf .",
    "this wider excess could most naturally be explained as coming from iras galaxies embedded in clusters with diffuse x - ray emission from the intercluster gas . in such cases",
    "the iras galaxy is not the source of the x - ray emission , which come from the cluster gas and may peak somewhere within the cluster size away from the iras galaxy .",
    "the size of nearby clusters from which we would expect rass  detectable intercluster gas emission is in fact of order 2 arcmin . in our detailed comparison of the rosat emission with the optical images we indeed found such clusters that we flagged accordingly ( grade 3 , cf .",
    "section 2.3 ) .",
    "the x - ray emission on the line of sight to iras f05537@xmath26653 is a representative example .    for our 372 candidate pairs we searched the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) for optical identifications within a distance of 2 arcmin around the iras psc positions",
    ". table 3 lists the x - ray and infrared positions , and the positions of the found ned counterparts ( we list at most nine of them ) with their basic optical properties . since ned",
    "comprises many catalogues , it may identify a given galaxy with several different names and coordinates .",
    "when an iras galaxy was clearly identified with an optical galaxy , the more accurate optical galaxy position is listed in table 3 instead of the iras position .",
    "we are aware that the spectral classification in ned is collected from the literature without quantifying the likelihood of the classification . for a better and consitent classification",
    "we therefore initiated an optical follow - up program the results of which will be presented in a separate paper .      in order to estimate the positional ( aspect ) errors of the x - ray sources we selected all iras galaxies with optical counterparts , and correlated the optical and rass  ii positions .",
    "for accurate optical positions for the iras galaxies we searched the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) guide star catalogue ( gsc ) ( lasker et al .",
    "1990 ; russell et al .",
    "1990 ; jenkner et al . 1990 ) .",
    "within a search radius of 5 arcmin 16,274 counterparts were found .",
    "figure 2 shows the distribution of the optical and rass  ii position offsets . under the reasonable assumption that the accuracy of the hst gsc positions is much higher than that of the rass  ii positions",
    ", we estimate the aspect error of the x - ray positions from the gaussian width of the central distribution peak as @xmath25 arcsec . for a gaussian distribution",
    "this results in 68% ( 90% ) of rosat sources found within 10 arcsec ( 18 arcsec ) of the hst gsc position .",
    "these numbers are in good agreement with the results ( 12 and 20 arcsec ) found by voges & boller ( 1997 ) by correlating the rosat bright source catalogue ( voges et al .",
    "1996b ) with the tycho catalogue for bright stars having an error of less than 1 arcsec ( cf . their fig .",
    "the 14,315 iras galaxies were previously correlated with the rass  i source catalogue and the results were presented in boller et al .",
    "( 1992a ) .",
    "the advantages of the rass  ii processing with respect to the rass  i processing are discussed in the introduction of this paper .",
    "52 objects from the original rass  i source catalogue are no longer included in the present catalogue .",
    "there are three reasons why objects were excluded ; ( i ) the infrared flux at 100 @xmath26 is greater than 10 jansky ( see the footnote in our introduction ) , 26 objects fulfill this criteria ; ( ii ) the positional offset from the new rass  ii processing between the rass  ii position and the infrared position is larger than 100 arcsec and/or the rass  ii detection likelihood is less than eight ( 25 objects ) , and ( iii ) , the number of rass  ii source photons is less than six ( one object ) .    due to the merging of the original rass  i strips into 1378 sky - fields of 6.4 @xmath1 6.4 degree ,",
    "78 new objects at fainter x - ray fluxes are detected in the rass  ii processing with respect to the rass  i processing and these objects appear now also in our new rass  ii catalogue of iras galaxies .",
    "the improved rass  ii processing and our individual examination of the x - ray emission structure with respect to the optically visible galaxy and its environment together provide a higher degree of reliability of this catalogue compared to the previous rass  i @xmath2 iras correlation .",
    "a third release of this catalogue might be called for if major improvements can be made in the sass processing .",
    "the photon event ( pet ) files from the rass  ii processing were used to produce x - ray images and contour plots . to obtain an optimal spatial resolution of the x - ray images",
    ", the pet files were binned in 5 arcsec width bins .",
    "the resulting images were then smoothed with a @xmath27 arcsec gaussian filter , corresponding to a full - width at half maximum of 45 arcsec , which is the expected width of the point spread function in the rosat all - sky survey .",
    "x - ray contours were computed in units of source photons per fwhm detection cell . the background photon density @xmath28",
    "is known at each source position from the rass  ii processing .",
    "to detect at least one source photon within a circular area of 45 arcsec diameter requires a mean photon density of @xmath29 .",
    "the source plus background photon density is known from the pet files and the exposure map .",
    "the lowest contour line was chosen to represent two source photons per fwhm detection cell .",
    "the higher contour levels represent 3,5,9,17 ( doubling the contour value difference ) and then @xmath30 ( for @xmath31 ) photons per fwhm detection cell .",
    "this choice of contours appears to best trace the source structure over their dynamic range .",
    "the x - ray photon flux contours were overlaid on optical images , and a cross marks the centroid x - ray position obtained by the rass  ii processing .",
    "rectangles were drawn to mark the positions of ned sources , and for the iras fsc or psc sources the 3@xmath3 error ellipse .",
    "the likelihood grade of the association of the x - ray emission with the iras galaxy ( see next section ) is printed in the lower right corner of each image .",
    "this does however not necessarily imply that the iras galaxy itself is responsible for the x - ray emission . since galaxies tend to be clustered ( cf .",
    "our discussion in sect .",
    "2.1.1 ) , the ir and x - ray emission may arise from neighboring galaxies , or from extended intercluster gas .",
    "an visual inspection of all 372 sources is therefore necessary to assess the emission structure in relation to the optically visible galaxy and its environment . in the visual examination",
    "we finally allow for a maximum separation of only 30 arcsec between the x - ray and the ir position , which reduces the number of expected chance coincidences to @xmath32 pairs .",
    "= 0.0 cm 1 : the x - ray emission is spatially clearly coincident with an optical counterpart to the iras galaxy . there is no significant surrounding x - ray emission peak within the 5 arcmin detection cell used in the rass  ii processing .",
    "objects with a classification grade 1 have the highest likelihood that the x - ray emission is actually originating from the iras galaxy .    2 : the x - ray emission is spatially coincident with an optical counterpart of the iras galaxy .",
    "however , there is significant surrounding x - ray emission within the rass  ii detection cell . in this case the rass  ii count rate was corrected by subtraction of the surrounding emission peaks , using the pet files . the number of source photons after subtraction of the secondary peaks is still required to be equal or greater then six .",
    "2db : the iras galaxy may be a blend of two or more galaxies not resolved in the iras fsc or iras psc .",
    "the x - ray emission is spatially coincident with the infrared position .",
    "the spatial resolution of the rosat all - sky survey does not allow a unique identification of one of the optical counterparts with the x - ray emission .    3",
    ": the x - ray emission shows complex and diffuse structure and can not be uniquely associated with the iras galaxy .",

    ": there is significant x - ray emission near the iras position , but it peaks at a distance larger than about 30 arcsec from the iras galaxy , which is about @xmath33 from the x - ray peak .",
