    "space interferometry mission ( sim ) was designed to perform global and narrow - angle astrometry at an unprecedented precision level of 1 - 10 microarcseconds per single measurement . at the time of its termination by nasa ( following an explicitly negative assessment by the national academy of science in the astro2010 decadal survey ) sim was in an advanced phase b ,",
    "having passed all eight technology development milestones .",
    "one of the ongoing phase b studies was aiming at constructing a uniform , all - sky grid of reference stars , which would serve as an important stepping stone toward generating a global reference frame at a @xmath0 @xmath1as level @xcite .",
    "sim would spend a considerable fraction of its operational life time observing some 1300 grid stars in the wide - angle regime .",
    "the grid was needed to construct a rigid global reference frame from essentially differential path delay measurements of objects within a @xmath2-diameter field of regard @xcite . establishing a set of verified",
    ", astrometrically stable grid stars was crucial for the success of the global astrometry mission .",
    "in particular , a significant fraction of binary systems among the culled grid objects could jeopardize the project .",
    "grid star candidates were selected by an elaborate system of criteria , deemed to maximize the rate of stable , single stars .",
    "a detailed discussion of the criteria is rather technical and is outside the scope of this paper .",
    "candidate grid stars were selected among presumably early k and clump giants , with estimated distances between 500 and 1000 pc .",
    "preference was given to candidates with small to moderate proper motions .",
    "the latter criterion was supposed to reduce the risk of selecting nearby red dwarfs , since neither spectroscopic luminosity class nor parallaxes were available for these 1011 mag stars .",
    "the candidates were found mostly in the tycho-2 catalog @xcite , avoiding the objects listed in the tycho double star catalog ( tds , * ? ? ? * ) , and from the guide star catalog ( gsc ) .",
    "most of the sample stars have @xmath3 colors between 1.0 and 1.3 mag .",
    "all stars have declinations south of @xmath4 .",
    "the sim project office organized a large - scale observational campaign to screen spectroscopic binaries in both celestial hemispheres .",
    "high - precision radial velocity ( rv ) observations of some 3500 grid candidates were to be collected by three teams through a competitive contract on medium - class telescopes .",
    "one of the teams , led by swiss astronomers didier queloz and damien segransan , produced the largest and most precise set of data spanning 753 days .",
    "the team used the 1.2 m euler telescope in eso la silla observatory , chile , equipped with the coralie spectrograph .",
    "the set - up of the instrument and the observing technique are similar to those used for the exoplanet search program @xcite .",
    "additional information on the calibration and data reduction techniques can be found in @xcite .",
    "the data set used in this paper is structured as shown in table 1 .",
    "a few lines of data are given for each of the 1134 observed stars .",
    "the first line is a header , consisting of the star s name , equatorial coordinates ( right ascension and declination ) on j2000 , number of rv measurements @xmath5 , derived mean rv in km s@xmath6 and its uncertainty ( including the estimated stellar jitter ) in km s@xmath6 , binarity confidence , binary flag ( 0 for non - binary , 1 for binary ) with 0.75 confidence , and binary flag with 0.95 confidence .",
    "the names are mostly tycho-2 identifications , which are consistent with the search engine of the simbad database .",
    "the rv values given in the header are the weighted mean estimates . for binary systems",
    ", these values may significantly deviate from the actual center - of - mass velocities .",
    "the heliocentric rv data are fully calibrated for known instrumental effects , but they do not include any star - specific corrections of astrophysical nature , such as convective blueshift or gravitational redshift . nor any corrections are implemented for a possible difference between the observed and template k0iii spectra .",
    "the header is followed by the specified number of individual rv measurement lines .",
    "each line contains the julian date of observation , observed rv in km s@xmath6 , and the formal observational error in m s@xmath6 .",
    "the latter is the estimated instrument error only , and as such , it does not include any uncertainty associated with the physical nature of the object .",
    "a total of 3026 observations are included in the table .",

    "the columns in a data line are : 1 ) julian date of observation ; 2 ) observed rv in km s@xmath6 ; and 3 ) the formal observational error in m s@xmath6 .",
    "given only two or three measurements for most stars , not much can be done toward characterizing spectroscopic binaries .",
    "we employed the simplest method of detecting possible binarity , i.e. , a test of rv constancy .",
    "the weighted mean rv is first computed from the available measurements .",
    "the residuals are then used to compute the @xmath7 statistics .",
    "if our assumptions about individual random errors of rv measurements are correct and there is no additional scatter due to binarity , the derived @xmath7 should follow the @xmath7 distribution of probabilities with @xmath8 degrees of freedom .",
    "in particular , the @xmath7 cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) specifies the probability of obtaining a value which is smaller than the observed value .",
    "reversely , @xmath9cdf@xmath10 defines the p - value of our statistical test , i.e. , the probability of the null hypothesis to be rejected while being true .",
    "the null hypothesis is that the star is single , and the observed scatter is solely caused by random errors with the expected variance .",
    "thus , the derived cdf@xmath10 can serve as the confidence of binarity detection .",
    "the main difficulty in this application is that the estimated formal errors of rv measurements only capture the instrumental part of the error budget , mostly the photon shot noise . a significant part , and in fact",
    ", the larger part of the observed dispersion in rv for giants , comes from the astrophysical phenomena on the stars themselves .",
    "this component , often called rv jitter , may be caused by stochastic and uncorrelated appearance of photospheric features on the surface , such as bright plages or dark spots , similar to the structures observed on the sun .",
    "the changes in the distribution of surface brightness result in correlated photometric and rv variations .",
    "the latter have a more complex character , being a convolution of surface brightness distribution with the differential rotation curve and the geometric projection onto the viewing direction .",
    "the basic relations for the photometric and rv jitter due to spots are given in @xcite .",
    "most of the parameters entering these relations are not known for field red giants , such as rotation velocities , typical relative surface area of spots , inclinations of the equator to the line of sight .",
    "little can be said about photospheric jitter on theoretical grounds . if the magnetic activity features are long - lived and large , such as observed on most magnetically active stars , many of these parameters can be reasonably estimated by intricate inverse solutions @xcite , but this is not valid for regular red giants .",
    "non - radial pulsations in red giants with periods between 1 hour and 3 days with photometric relative amplitudes peaking at 400 ppm may provide another significant contribution to the observed astrophysical jitter , but this assumption can only be verified by simultaneous , high - accuracy rv and photometric measurements at high cadence .    if we knew which of the observed star are spectroscopically single , we could easily estimate the sample - mean jitter . the mean jitter",
    "is quadratically added to the instrumental error for each observation , and the median @xmath7 over the sample of single stars should be close to the argument of cdf at 0.5 .",
    "in other words , half of the single stars should have p - values smaller than 0.5 .",
    "but it is not known a priori which stars are single , therefore , we can estimate only robust bounds for the jitter component .",
    "the upper bound is derived from the assumption that the observed scatter is only due to observational error and jitter , i.e. , all the stars in the sample are non - binary .",
    "the level of jitter is adjusted until the median @xmath7 is equal to the expected value @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the upper bound for the mean jitter thus estimated is 51 m s@xmath6 .",
    "the actual value is certainly smaller , because a significant fraction of the sample are strongly perturbed by binarity .",
    "the lower bound for jitter comes from the assumption that only the higher half of sample values @xmath7 are affected by spectroscopic binarity .",
    "the jitter level is adjusted until the median @xmath7 of the lower half of the sample distribution reaches the expected value @xmath11 .",
    "the lower bound comes up to 24 m s@xmath6 .",
    "we adopt the mean of the two bounds , 37 m s@xmath6 , as the average jitter dispersion for the sample .",
    "this value is likely to be slightly overestimated because , as we will see shortly , the rate of detectable binaries seems to be closer to 0.5 than to 0 .    with this amount of jitter quadratically added to the formal instrument errors , the resulting distribution of confidence levels is shown in fig .",
    "[ pvalue.fig ] .",
    "we note that the distribution of confidence levels is quite flat everywhere except the highest bin .",
    "the flatness of this distribution is a significant result in itself , pertaining to the nature of binary systems with red giant primaries . with 2 degrees of freedom ,",
    "the @xmath7 reaches 10 for the corresponding cdf value of @xmath12 .",
    "the mass of companion in a 1 year orbit corresponding to this detectable signal is of the order of @xmath13 . in principle , even giant exoplanets can be detected with 3 observations .",
    "the range of confidence levels between 0.993 and 0.99999 corresponds to the range 0.005 - @xmath14 of companion mass , thus , these data should be sensitive to super - jupiters and brown dwarf companions in 1-year orbits .",
    "the absence of significant excess at these confidence levels seems to confirm the ",
    "brown dwarf desert \" phenomenon , i.e. , the paucity of substellar - mass secondary companions in binary systems .",
    "however , when the jitter is set at the lower bound level of 24 m s@xmath6 , we detect a small upturn of the observed @xmath15 distribution starting already at 0.95 .",
    "this cdf value corresponds , very approximately , to companion masses of @xmath16 for both 1 and 2 degrees of freedom .",
    "hence , these results do not preclude the existence of a limited number ( @xmath17 ) of super - jupiter planets or brown dwarf companions in our sample , which can be found among the marginally significant positives .    at a threshold confidence level of 0.95 ,",
    "the rate of spectroscopic binaries is 32% .",
    "the binarity rate comes up to 46% for the lower confidence threshold 0.75 .",
    "as previously discussed , our accepted jitter value ( 37 m s@xmath6 ) may be overestimated .",
    "the true binarity rate is likely between 37 and 46 % .",
    "if we set the jitter component at the lower bound of 24 m s@xmath6 , the estimated rate of binaries comes up to 41% at 0.95 confidence .",
    "this number may include the contribution of substellar mass companions .",
    "a few stars in the sample have unusually large rv variation , implying exceptionally high mass ratios or very short orbital periods , or both .",
    "we select two such objects , which deserve a careful follow - up investigation .    *",
    "tyc 6948 - 00350 - 1 = hd 206092 * was observed with a total rv range of 266 km s@xmath6 .",
    "this g9 iii star has been identified by @xcite as rotationally variable with an astonishing period of @xmath18 d and a line broadening parameter @xmath19 of 80 km s@xmath6 .",
    "now it is also detected as a spectroscopic binary with a rv semi - amplitude of at least 133 km s@xmath6 .",
    "assuming that the primary star is synchronized , and the rotation period equals the orbital period , the mass ratio for this system should be above 1 , or the eccentricity should be high .",
    "the latter option is not feasible in the light of previous studies of rotational velocities of red giants in binary systems @xcite , which found that all binaries with periods shorter than 20 d are circularized .",
    "we attempted to fold the available rv measurements with the rotational period , but failed to obtain a clear phase curve .",
    "follow - up photometric and spectroscopic observations are needed to reveal the nature of this enigmatic object .",
    "* tyc 7381 - 00433 - 1 = hd 318347 * has a rv range of at least 212 km s@xmath6 .",
    "little is known about this star .",
    "surprisingly though , it is listed in simbad as o@xmath20 type with emission lines , that is , a very hot and massive star .",
    "however , it is quite red with a @xmath21 determined by @xcite .",
    "we surmise this binary star may include a regular red giant accompanied by a post - agb star or some other rare type of object on a short - period orbit .",
    "our estimate of multiplicity fraction for 1333 randomly selected , field red giant stars is close to the more accurately known rate for nearby solar - type stars , 46%@xmath222% @xcite .",
    "our best estimate is 41% , which may or may not include companions of substellar mass , depending on the actual level of stellar rv jitter and its distribution .",
    "the method of binarity detection employed in this paper is not sensitive to binaries with orbital periods longer than several years , possibly lowering this estimate by several percent .",
    "the wider - separation pairs are to be detected by direct imaging @xcite or astrometric techniques @xcite .",
    "they may contribute a few more percent to the all - inclusive multiplicity fraction , although the wide and common proper motion companions are often found in hierarchical multiple systems @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , dwarfs more massive than the sun , which are more likely to be the progenitors of the present - day k giants , have a slightly higher binarity rate than their sub - solar counterparts @xcite .",
    "the overarching conclusion is that there seems to be no significant difference in the incidence of binarity among main - sequence dwarfs and field red giants .",
    "our results are consistent with other observational data for field red giants . @xcite collected and analyzed rv data for 77 g and k giants and detected a 20% multiplicity rate , despite the preliminary binarity screening .",
    "the rv jitter for those bluer and less luminous giants not detected as binary was constrained to @xmath23 m s@xmath6 .",
    "based on the much larger sample and more observations , we are able to drastically improve these estimates .",
    "part of the research described in this paper was carried out at the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
