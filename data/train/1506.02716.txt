    "many proposals have suggested that these states are tetraquarks or _",

    "there is also a suggestion that these states can be a result of the mixing of @xmath14 and @xmath15 states ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "first , we will consider the chiral loop contributions to the @xmath20 decay rate .",
    "the decay width for the @xmath20 , averaged over the @xmath1 polarizations , can be written as : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the mass of initial particle @xmath1 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 .",

    "another interesting feature is , that the amplitude @xmath135 is nonzero due to the mass difference of the @xmath151 and @xmath152 mesons .",
