    "the properties of polycrystalline materials , ranging from chemical resistance to fracture toughness , depend on the orientations and populations of the grains of which they are comprised  @xcite .",

    "texture can also result from cyclic thermomechanical loading which causes some orientations to grow at the expense of others .",
    "such cyclic loading is common , for instance , in most electrical devices where it can have a deleterious effect on the solder connections of circuit boards  @xcite .",

    "this type of microstructural evolution , at relatively high temperatures and within the realm of very small deformations , is referred to as _ stress - induced texture_. this texture has not been studied to the same degree as the texture development associated with materials processing  @xcite , and it is the focus of the work presented here .",

    "missing from the arsenal , though , are monte carlo ( mc ) methods , and this is most likely because a discrete , probabilistic setting does not lend itself to the calculation of stress .",
    "the current work remedies this by developing a hybrid algorithm in which a deterministic , continuum computation of elastic energy is dovetailed with mc kinetics for microstructural evolution . in order to focus on the methodology , we restrict our attention to evolution dominated by grain boundary kinetics and disregard independent triple junction kinetics@xcite .",
    "this implies that the grain boundary properties are isotropic .",
