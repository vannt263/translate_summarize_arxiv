    "spin - orbit interaction influences the electronic and transport properties of semiconductors . for example",
    ", it lifts the degeneracy of the valence bands , modifies the electron g - factor,@xcite and causes skew scattering in the presence of ( spinless ) impurities .",
    "such a skew scattering is a possible mechanism for the extrinsic spin hall effect.@xcite in addition , spin - orbit interaction plays an important role in the recently proposed intrinsic spin hall effect.@xcite it is also crucial in the mechanisms of spin relaxation and optical orientation in semiconductors.@xcite    it is highly desirable to generate flows of polarized spins in semiconductors with the help of the spin - orbit interaction . in these endeavors ,",
    "the rashba spin - orbit coupling@xcite in two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) plays a special role since it allows manipulation of spin flows by varying the gate bias .",
    "this has motivated several creative proposals for its application.@xcite to explore the possibilities , the effect of rashba coupling in many types of mesoscopic structure have been investigated , such as a quantum wire,@xcite a quantum ring,@xcite and a quantum dot.@xcite in several studies , it was found that a device with a simple geometry , in combination with the rashba coupling , could serve as a spin filter .",
    "for example , the device could be a t - shaped channel,@xcite a quantum point contact,@xcite parallel interfaces that cause double refraction,@xcite or even just a curved wire.@xcite after applying a magnetic field , we could further build a spin filter based on electron focusing,@xcite or based on the an interferometer of the stern - gerlach type.@xcite    in this paper , we study the scattering of electrons by a disk in the 2deg with rashba coupling.@xcite the analysis can be applied to a wide range of situations in which the radius @xmath0 of the disk can be much smaller , roughly the same , or much larger than the electron wave length @xmath1 .",
    "for example , the usual impurity scattering can be simulated with @xmath2 , while the scattering by an artificial mesoscopic disk corresponds to @xmath3 . here",
    "we focus on the latter case to search for possible effect of local spin generation .",
    "we find that , because of the rashba coupling , spin - up and spin - down electrons are indeed separated and accumulate in regions of curved stripes .",
    "the associated charge and spin currents are analyzed in details .",
    "in addition , the properties of symmetry , as well as the differential cross - section , are also investigated.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "ii is the theoretical analysis . in sec .",
    "iii , the results from numerical calculations are presented .",
    "iv is the conclusion .",
    "consider a two - dimensional electron system with a circular disk at the origin , @xmath4 where @xmath5 when @xmath6 and 0 otherwise . in the following",
    ", the potential of the disk is considered infinite (  hard \" disk ) .",
    "the two - component wave function @xmath7 with energy @xmath8 satisfies the coupled equations : @xmath9 it follows that the energy eigenstates of the hamiltonian with momentum @xmath10 , helicity @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , and angular momentum @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is an integer ) are @xmath15 where @xmath16 can be a bessel function , a neumann function , or their linear combination , such as a hankel function",
    ". we will choose the hankel functions as the eigen - basis since their behavior at large radius suits the boundary condition for scattering .",
    "the energy eigenstate of the schroedinger equation with energy @xmath8 and angular momentum @xmath13 can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "the first two terms have positive helicity ; while the other two terms have negative helicity .",
    "the most general eigenstate of the schroedinger equation with energy @xmath8 is a superposition of the @xmath19 s , where the coefficients @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are determined by boundary conditions . because of the circular symmetry of the potential , the angular momentum is conserved for each @xmath14-component .",
    "therefore , each component can be considered independent during the scattering .",
    "the incident plane wave with momentum @xmath10 and helicity @xmath11 can be decomposed as the following linear superposition : @xmath22 the bessel functions @xmath23 can be further decomposed as hankel functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the former correspond to outgoing circular waves , while the later correspond to incoming circular waves ( with no phase shift ) .",
    "if an incident wave has a definite helicity , @xmath26 , then by comparing eq .",
    "( 4 ) with the components of eq .  ( 5 ) at large distance , one will obtain @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( i.e. no incoming circular wave with negative helicity ) for all @xmath14 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30 need to be determined from the boundary condition at @xmath31 . for a hard disk , it can be shown that @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "notice that the nonzero probability amplitudes @xmath30 lead to outgoing waves with flipped helicity . for reference , if the incident wave is @xmath35 , then @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "at the mean time , the roles of @xmath10 and @xmath38 , as well as the roles of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , have to be interchanged .    a note on the unitary condition : for convenience of discussion , consider an incoming wave with positive helicity and angular momentum @xmath13 ( i.e. , the @xmath39-wavelet ) .",
    "because the angular momentum is conserved during the scattering , the electron can only be scattered to @xmath29 and @xmath30 channels with the same @xmath14 . from particle conservation at large distance ,",
    "one expects that the probability amplitudes in eq .",
    "( 4 ) should satisfy @xmath40 for all @xmath14 , which has indeed been confirmed in our numerical calculation .",
    "the system has a mirror symmetry with respect to the @xmath41-axis .",
    "therefore , by analyzing the schrodinger equation with @xmath42 replaced by @xmath43 , one finds @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the mirror - reflected point of @xmath47 . such as relation",
    "can also be obtained by a space inversion of the ( three - dimensional ) coordinate , followed by a rotation with respect to the new @xmath42-axis by 180 degrees .",
    "consequently , for the expectation value of the spin , we have @xmath48 in a rashba system , the current density operator is defined as , @xmath49 therefore , the distribution of the expectation value of the current density has the following symmetry : @xmath50 we adopt the generally accepted definition of the spin current density operator,@xcite @xmath51 , whose expectation values have the symmetries , @xmath52 these symmetries will be confirmed by the numerical results in sec .",
    "iii .      for convenience",
    ", the wave function @xmath53 can be seperated into an incident plane wave and a scattered wave . at large distance with @xmath54 ,",
    "the scattered wave has the asymptotic form , @xmath55 where @xmath56 it can be shown that @xmath57 .",
    "also , for the incoming plane wave @xmath58 , @xmath59 therefore , @xmath60-spinor and @xmath61-spinor possess spins with opposite directions at large distance .",
    "both spins lie on the plane and are perpendicular to the direction of propagation .",
    "one can obtain the same equations for the incoming wave @xmath62 , but the signs of the spin expectation values are opposite .",
    "after a straightforward calculation , one can show that the scattered current density at large distance is @xmath63 from which the differential cross - section @xmath64 can be calculated . for incoming waves @xmath26 and @xmath35 , the current densities",
    "@xmath65 and @xmath66 are @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively .",
    "in fact , they are equal in magnitude if the two incident waves have the same energy . therefore , the differential cross - sections @xmath69 for incoming waves with helicity @xmath11 are @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the @xmath60-spinor in eq .",
    "( 12 ) , but with the coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath39 suitably chosen for the scattering of @xmath72 , similarly for @xmath73 ( see the discussion following eq .  ( 6 ) ) .",
    "the differential cross - sections @xmath74 and @xmath75 represent helicity - preserved and helicity - flipped scatterings respectively .",
    "if the incoming wave is an incoherent mixture of both helicities with fractional populations @xmath76 , then the differential cross - section is simply the weighted average of the two differential cross - sections : @xmath77 .    , with @xmath78 .",
    "the incident wave is an equal mixture of both helicities @xmath79 .",
    "lighter ( darker ) regions represent the regions of spin up ( down ) . the peak intensity in this figure is approximately 0.22 ( 1 for fully polarized).,width=268 ]",
    "in the following , we report on the distributions of spin density , charge current density , and spin current density , assuming the wave length of the incident wave @xmath80 .",
    "we have also studied the cases with a larger @xmath1 ( e.g. @xmath81 ) and a smaller @xmath1 ( e.g. @xmath82 ) .",
    "these results are not presented since the main difference is the change of scales . in the limit of @xmath83 ,",
    "whose scale is more relevant to the case of impurity scattering , only the components with the smallest angular momentum ( @xmath14=0 and @xmath84 ) need to be considered . from eq .",
    "( [ ac ] ) , one finds that both @xmath85 and @xmath86 as @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , there would be little change of helicity in the long wave length limit .    for comparison with realistic values ,",
    "we choose @xmath88 for electrons in the gaas - algaas heterojunctions .",
    "the radius of the disk is fixed at @xmath0=1000 @xmath89 . the corresponding fermi energy and electron density for @xmath90 are 2.2 mev and @xmath91/@xmath92 respectively , which are typical values . to enhance the visual effect of the spin - orbit coupling , the rashba energy @xmath93 is chosen to be one - tenth of the kinetic energy @xmath94 , which requires @xmath95 nm - ev , about one order of magnitude larger than the value in gaas .     with wavelength @xmath80 .",
    "[ @xmath78],width=268 ]    the out - of - plane ( @xmath97 ) spin component results from a spin - unpolarized incident wave with an equal ( incoherent ) mixture of both helicities is plotted in fig .  1 , which is antisymmetric with respect to the horizontal @xmath41-axis : @xmath98 .",
    "notice that the incident waves with opposite helicities ( but the same energy ) have different wave vectors ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "therefore , their interference patterns for opposite helicities with spins point at opposite directions are slightly displaced with respect to each other . because of",
    "such a displacement between @xmath100 and @xmath101 , regions with net @xmath97-spin still exist after partial cancellation .",
    "the existence of @xmath102 relies on the scattered part of the wave function in the near - field region [ see eqs .",
    "( [ scattered ] ) and ( [ far ] ) ] and would decay to zero at large distance .    unlike the spins in fig .",
    "1 , the distribution of charge current ( fig .",
    "2 ) , as well as the differential cross - section ( fig .",
    "3 ) , which is defined using the _ charge _ current densities , are not sensitive to the strength of the rashba coupling , and look very similar even if the coupling is turned off . notice that rashba spin - orbit coupling in fact preserves the helicity .",
    "the major cause of the helicity flip is the potential @xmath103 , which is incompatible with the helicity operator . in fig .  2",
    ", the distribution of charge current density from the scattering of @xmath26 shows the expected pattern of the flow around the disk .",
    "if the incident wave is a mixed state , then instead of cancellation , the slightly displaced current densities from both helicities will add up .    ) for wave length @xmath80 ( solid line for @xmath104 , dashed line for @xmath105 ) and @xmath106 ( dash - dotted line for @xmath104 , dotted line for @xmath105 ) .",
    "the numbers in the legend are total cross - sections after integration over angle .",
    "[ @xmath78],width=268 ]    the differential cross - sections for @xmath26 are shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen that the helicity - preserved scattering ( @xmath104 ) peaks at the forward direction ( @xmath107 ) , while the helicity - flipped scattering ( @xmath105 ) peaks at the backward direction ( @xmath108 ) . at the backward direction , @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , the helicity of the electron has to be flipped , but _ its spin remains conserved_. at longer wave length @xmath106 , @xmath105 gains more weight and",
    "the total differential cross - section @xmath110 becomes more isotropic .",
    ", @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",
    "the incident wave has a well - defined helicity @xmath100 with @xmath113 .",
    "[ @xmath78 ] ]    the distributions of spin current density are shown in fig .",
    "4.@xcite a prominent feature in the figures is the overall trend for the @xmath114 vectors to point to the left .",
    "this counter - intuitive behavior is simply related to the fact that the spin current density is equal to the product of velocity and spin , where the velocity is in the positive @xmath41-direction and the spin points to the _ minus _",
    "@xmath42-direction for @xmath26 , therefore the scattering @xmath115 vectors generically point to the left . on the contrary , for @xmath35 with spin points to the _ positive _ @xmath42-direction",
    ", the direction of the flow will be reversed .",
    "this also explains why the magnitudes of the spin currents @xmath116 are small in most of the regions , since the original incident current has no @xmath117 and @xmath102 components .    in fig .",
    "4 , it can be seen that @xmath118 oscillates both in amplitude and direction between the curved stripes .",
    "an incident wave with opposite helicity would reverse such a flow .",
    "therefore , part of these flows are cancelled if the incident current is not polarized . however , local spin current that oscillates in space still exist , similar to the case of the spin density in fig .  1 .",
    "all of the local spin currents @xmath119 would vanish for unpolarized incident electrons once the rashba coupling is turned off .",
    "however , if @xmath120 is nonzero but the disk is removed ( i.e. , free space ) , then there exist spin currents @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 , which is the background spin current cautioned by rashba.@xcite it reflects the unsatisfying current status on a proper definition of the spin current .",
    "our system with unilateral current flow seems to be the same as the 2deg driven by an electric field,@xcite but there is no global transverse spin current @xmath118 , no matter the disk is removed or not .",
    "this does not contradict the result of the proposed intrinsic spin hall effect in a clean 2deg.@xcite the incident charge current flowing to the right can be understood as originating from the slightly unbalanced electrochemical potentials on the two leads far away . in our case , all the electrons are moving along the direction of the potential gradient , instead of moving at all directions on the fermi surface in sinova _",
    "s paper.@xcite consequently , no spin hall effect is expected if one follows similar semiclassical analysis in ref .  .",
    "in summary , the influence of the spin - orbit coupling on the scattering of 2d electrons from a hard disk is studied .",
    "such a simple setup offers us a good opportunity to investigate the properties of spin and spin current in details .",
    "we focus our attention on the near - field regime , where the scattered wave is comparable to the incident wave , and appreciable out - of - plane spins can be found .",
    "this work offers us a clear understanding of the microscopic dynamics around the mesoscopic disk , and could serve as a basis for future works considering a threaded magnetic flux in the disk , or a hybrid device involving a disk as a component .        , by c. kittel , wiley & sons , 1963 .",
