    "the so - called strong cp problem is one of them . up to now , the most promising strong cp solution is axion @xcite .",
    "although its coupling is very small , it could have affected the evolution of the universe .    on the other hand ,",
    "the observations like the galaxy rotation curve and the cosmic microwave background radiation tell us that a significant portion of the energy density of the universe can not be explained by the ordinary baryonic matter .",
    "the recent analysis of wmap data@xcite combining the observation of the large scale structure prefers the standard vacuum energy and cold dark matter ( @xmath0cdm ) model , with the cold dark matter ( cdm ) density @xmath1 .    during the inflation ,",
    "a sufficiently light scalar field becomes spatially homogeneous and its value is selected stochastically@xcite . after the inflation , the hubble parameter decreases as the universe expands .",
    "if the hubble parameter becomes smaller than some scale , usually the scalar mass scale , the scalar field starts to roll down . in the hydrodynamic description ,",
    "this coherent oscillation works as cold matter in the evolution of the universe .",
    "if the interaction is small enough to keep coherence until the matter - dominant era , it can be a part of the present matter energy density of the universe .",
    "the axion is that kind of particle and can be coherent until even now .",
    "just after the invisible axion was introduced @xcite , people recognized its cosmological implications that the classical axion field oscillation behaves like cdm @xcite . on the axion cdm energy density ,",
    "turner presented a more accurate number including anharmonic effect and numerical instanton calculation in late 1980s @xcite .",
    "degrand _ et . al .",
    "_ concerned about the possible effects of the chiral phase transition @xcite .    after turner s pioneering work , many input parameters in axion cosmology , especially the qcd parameters , are refined .",
    "we present the improved number for the axion dark matter relic density with these new parameters .",
    "we also discuss the possible effects of the chiral phase transition on the total entropy and the axion number density .",
    "this occurs only when supercooling arises .",
    "axion is a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson , acquiring mass from the instanton effect .",
    "the temperature dependence of the axion mass is important in calculating axion energy density for which we will use the result of ref .",
    "@xcite obtained in the dilute gas approximation . for the purpose of sketching the computation , we just parameterize the axion potential as @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "the inflation freezes all fields whose masses are smaller than the hubble parameter at that time",
    ". it also flattens the fluctuation of the field .",
    "consequently , just after the inflation , the sufficiently light fields remain homogeneous with a certain value that is determined stochastically .",
    "the axion and the moduli are typical representatives of them .    at the end of inflation , the universe is reheated by some processes . since axion is very weakly interacting , the reheated radiation of the early universe can not destroy its coherence . as the universe cools down",
    ", the hubble friction can no longer be the dominant term and the axion field starts rolling down the potential hill and continues to oscillate . since the hubble parameter becomes smaller and smaller than the axion mass , or the oscillating period of the axion is smaller than the hubble time , its energy and pressure can be described by the time averages during each oscillation . in the case of the harmonic potential ,",
    "the effective pressure is zero and the axion field acts like cold matter in the evolving universe .",
    "moreover , if the axion can keep the coherence until the matter domination epoch , it can contribute to the present cdm energy density .",
    "since the axion mass depends on the temperature or the time , the comoving energy density conservation does not work in estimating the axion relic density .",
    "however , the adiabatic theorem says that as long as the adiabatic conditions @xmath6 hold , we can find the _",
    "adiabatic invariant _ @xmath7 . for the harmonic potential , the invariant is the comoving axion number density @xmath8 .",

    "this region is in the boundary of weak and strong coupling regimes and it is difficult to estimate the axion mass very accurately in this region .",
    "early attempts to estimate the temperature dependent axion mass has been given in @xcite .",
    "in these earlier studies , this phase transition was not considered and here we point out that the consideration of the phase transition does not lead to a substantial change in the estimation of the axion energy density .    in the hadronic phase below the critical temperature , the correlation length of @xmath11 pair is large and",

    "we assumed two adiabaticity conditions , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "however , since the expansion rate during the first few oscillations are not so small , @xmath76 , we should be careful in treating the anharmonic correction in the initial stage . actually , even for the case of the harmonic limit , @xmath77 , the initial adjustment is needed . for a large initial misalignment angle , @xmath78 , the duration time during which the expansion rate is not so small is longer than for the case of a small @xmath79 .",
