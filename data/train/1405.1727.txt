    "in the solar neighbourhood , the vertical velocity dispersion ( @xmath1 ) of stars is correlated with their age . stars with an age of 910 gyr",
    "have a @xmath1of about 40 km  s@xmath2(or more , depending on the selection criteria , and in particular on the inclusion or exclusion of halo stars , see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "by contrast , 1 gyr - old stars have a @xmath1of 1216 km  s@xmath2 , and the youngest stars are rather cold : @xcite find that the bluest stars have a @xmath1of only 6 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the exact shape of the age - velocity relation ( or avr ) is however debated , partly because measuring stellar ages is difficult @xcite , and partly because the selection criteria differ between different surveys @xcite : we show in figure [ fig : observations ] two examples of observational results giving avrs with very different shapes . for instance , @xcite propose a rapid increase of @xmath1for ages smaller than 3 gyr , followed by a plateau corresponding to a saturation of @xmath1at @xmath3 20 km  s@xmath2 , and a final jump for ages greater than 9 gyr .",
    "@xcite find a similar saturation , but occuring for stars older than 5 gyr .",
    "by contrast , others argue in favour of a continuously rising @xmath1with age , following a power law @xmath1@xmath4 where @xmath5 is close to 0.5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , @xcite as well as @xcite have shown that the current data do not favour a power law evolution over a saturation of @xmath1for ages greater than 45 gyr .",
    "the saturation after 3 gyr that was proposed by @xcite from a sample of 189 stars is excluded by the current data .    with age ( as measured by holmberg et al.).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    a possibility is that the shape of the avr is determined by the properties of stars at birth , i.e. stars are born with a decreasing @xmath1with decreasing redshift .",
    "this is supported by observations of turbulent gas discs at high redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so that stars are naturally born hotter at higher redshift ( note however that typical clumpy galaxies might be too massive to be the progenitors of milky way - type galaxies , e.g. @xcite ) , and by the idea that turbulence ( and thus @xmath1 ) decreases with redshift because of decreasing gas accretion rates @xcite .",
    "most theoretical works have assumed that stars were born with a roughly constant @xmath1over the last 89 gyrs , and that their present - day @xmath1is the result of gradual heating . @xcite",
    "first proposed that the source of that heating could be the scattering of stars by giant molecular clouds with masses of @xmath6 m@xmath7 .",
    "it was later shown that the number of gmcs in the milky way is too small to reproduce the observed heating , and that ratio of vertical to radial velocity dispersions is too high compared to observations @xcite .",
    "by contrast , spiral arms are very inefficient at vertical heating but can provide some radial heating provided that they are transient and stochastic @xcite , or that multiple density waves coexist @xcite . it was thus suggested that heating by a combination of spiral arms and gmcs could match the observed avr @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite showed that heating by gmcs is not as efficient as previously thought , and instead proposed a combination of heating by gmcs and halo black holes ( see also @xcite for an early study of heating by halo black holes ) .",
    "another important mechanism for disc evolution is the radial migration of stars under the action of non - axisymmetric perturbations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in recent years",
    "the idea has emerged that radial migration could be a source of disc heating : the analytical model of @xcite combines recipes for radial migration and chemical evolution and shows that migration alone could be responsible for the chemo - dynamical trends observed in the milky way . as a result , disc heating has been attributed to radial migration in the simulations analysed by @xcite . however",
    ", the model by @xcite assumes that the vertical energy is conserved during migration , while simulations have later shown that it is the vertical action that is conserved @xcite .",
    "the important consequence is that the contribution of radial migration to disc heating is negligible , except in the outer regions where it induces some flaring @xcite .",
    "this result is the consequence of the balance between outwards migrating stars , which heat the disc , and inward migrators , which cool it ( note that @xcite find that migration induces heating but only consider outwards migrators ) .",
    "it thus seems that while internal secular evolution clearly induces disc thickening , it is often difficult to figure out which mechanisms are acting in realistic simulations that include gas , spiral arms , bars and live dark matter halos ( see for instance @xcite , for simulations where heating in the inner disc is due to a bar , but where the causes of heating in the outer disc are less clear ) . in any case , it would seem that radial migration is not a dominant contributor to secular heating .    for real galaxies",
    "however a final potentially important source of heating is the interaction with satellite galaxies , mostly in the form of minor mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the amount of heating provided depends not only on the merger ratio , but also on many other parameters like the orbit of the satellite @xcite or the gas content of the main galaxy @xcite .",
    "@xcite have shown from a sample of cosmological simulations performed with different techniques that mergers create jumps in the avr , and thus point towards a quiescent merger history for the milky way , for which no such jumps are seen for ages lower than 9 gyr .",
    "this paper is the second of a series that uses a sample of seven simulated galaxies with different merger histories to understand the effect of mergers on the structure of galactic discs . in paper",
    "i @xcite , we present in detail our sample and the analyses we perform .",
    "we dissect the discs in so - called mono - age populations ( in 500 myr - wide age bins ) , and compare their structure to milky way observations by @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we focus solely on the avr .",
    "we present briefly our simulations in section 2 , and then discuss the velocity dispersion of young stars in section 3 . in section 4 , we compare the avr in galaxies with quiescent or active merger histories .",
    "in section 5 , we study the origin of the slope of the avr in quiescent galaxies , and discuss potential numerical limitations in section 6 before summarizing our results in section 7 .",
    "the simulations we use in this paper are the same as in paper i , to which we refer the reader for a detailed description of the simulation technique .",
    "the sample consists of seven galaxies simulated using a zoom - in cosmological re - simulation technique ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this technique consists in first running a `` dark matter only ''",
    "cosmological simulation , in extracting merger and accretion histories for a set of haloes , and in re - simulating these histories at higher resolution , starting at @xmath8 with a seed galaxy .",
    "we follow the evolution of that seed galaxy down to @xmath9 by including mergers as well as accretion of gas and dark matter as prescribed by the cosmological simulation .",
    "the re - simulations use a particle - mesh code with a grid size of 150 pc , where gas dynamics is modelled with a sticky - particle algorithm .",
    "the mass resolution is @xmath10  m@xmath11 for gas particles , @xmath12  m@xmath11 for star particles ( @xmath10  m@xmath11 for star particles formed from gas during the simulation ) , and @xmath13  m@xmath11 for dark matter particles . for the galaxies studied here ,",
    "there are typically 2 to 6 million star particles in the discs at @xmath9 .",
    "we model star formation following a schmidt law with an exponent of 1.5 above a volume density threshold of 0.03 m@xmath11pc@xmath14 ( i.e. , 1 h cm@xmath14 ) .",
    "we take into account stellar mass loss ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as kinetic feedback from supernovae explosions , where 20% of the energy of the supernovae is distributed to neighbouring gas particles .",
    "the seven chosen galaxies have a total stellar mass at @xmath9 of between @xmath16 m@xmath11 and @xmath17 m@xmath11 , and bulge - to - total ratios between 0.04 and 0.5 ( see table 1 in paper i ) .",
    "they were selected to have a range of formation histories as follows :    * g37 * and * g92 * have quiescent histories : over their last 9 gyr of evolution they only have interactions with mass ratios smaller than 1:50 .    * g47 * is also mostly quiescent , but undergoes a 1:15 interaction with a satellite at @xmath188.59 gyr , the satellite does not merge with g47 but significantly disturbs its morphology    * g22 * undergoes a 1:10 merger at @xmath19 gyr    * g48 * undergoes a 1:4 merger at @xmath20 gyr    * g102 * undergoes a 1:15 merger at @xmath21 gyr    * g106 * undergoes a 1:5 merger at @xmath22 gyr    the properties of each galaxy are analysed at @xmath9 .",
    "in this paper , we present the age - velocity relation for particles in age bins of 500 myr .",
    "we first remove counter - rotating stars to minimize the contamination of our sample by halo stars .",
    "then , we measure the vertical velocity dispersion for each population within a 2 kpc - wide annulus centered at 2 r@xmath23 ( r@xmath23 is the scale - length obtained from an exponential fit to the total stellar mass distribution ) , and up to a height including 95% of stars of that population ( limited to 5 kpc above the disc plane ) .",
    "we estimate @xmath1from the second moment of the velocity distribution ; the resulting avr is shown in figure [ fig : avr ] for each of the seven galaxies .",
    "since errors on ages are a significant observational issue , we perform an additional test : we add a gaussian error on the age of each stellar particle before re - computing the avr using the blurred ages .",
    "we test assumed age errors of 20% and 30% , which are typical of current observational measurements @xcite .",
    "the resulting avrs are shown as black lines in figure [ fig : avr ] .    in the next section ,",
    "we compare the overall shape of the avr for quiescent and active galaxies , and discuss the values of @xmath1for young stars .",
    "the shape of the avr is very different for galaxies with different merger histories ( figure [ fig : avr ] ) .",
    "quiescent galaxies show a smooth rise of the avr , while mergers leave well defined jumps .",
    "an exception is g106 : it undergoes a 1:5 merger , but this merger happens early enough so that it leaves little trace in the avr . in the following , we thus study g106 together with the quiescent galaxies .",
    "apart from the oldest populations , which have a high @xmath1 in all cases , the quiescent galaxies show a very regularly rising @xmath1with age .",
    "interestingly , the fly - by undergone by g47 does not leave any trace in the avr at a radius of 2@xmath24 , only leaving signatures in the outer disc of g47 .    in the milky way",
    ", the avr is often fitted by a power law corresponding to @xmath1@xmath4 in intermediate ages range ( excluding young unrelaxed stars , and hot old stars ) .",
    "the heating index @xmath5 is difficult to measure but usually found close to 0.5 @xcite , and its value has been used to discriminate between disc heating mechanisms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we similarly fit the simulated avrs with a power law for ages between 2 and 7.5 gyr ( 6.5 gyr for g106 ) , and find heating indices close to 0.5 ( see table [ tab - heating ] ) .",
    "this is a good match to the avr in the milky way , suggesting that the heating in our simulations is reasonable .",
    ".heating index for the four most quiescent galaxies .",
    "the heating index is measured as the slope of a linear fit to the logarithm of the avr for ages between 2 and 7.5 gyr ( 6.5 gyr for g106 ) .",
    "we show both the actual value of the index , and the value measured on the avr when a 20% or 30 % age error is first taken into account ( the black lines in figure [ fig : avr ] ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     0.03 for g92 , showing a good match to the observed slope .",
    "we selected only stars close to the disc plane to replicate the selection criterion of the geneva - copenhagen survey .",
    "we find that this results only in a small overall number of old stars in the sample , and that , when age errors are added , the jump in @xmath1found for old stars is totally washed out , making the simulation consistent with gcs data.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    when we add an error of 20% or 30% to the age of each stellar particle , for `` blurred ages '' smaller than 8 gyr , we do not find significant changes to the shape of the avr ( black lines on figure [ fig : avr ] ) .",
    "this is because the number density in this age range generally does not vary much and @xmath1increases smoothly with age .",
    "the heating indices are mostly unchanged with 20% age errors , and are slightly reduced with 30 % age errors , which means that the avr is slightly flattened ( see table [ tab - heating ] ) .",
    "an exception is g106 , for which the stars with a true age of @xmath3 8 gyr ( hotter because of the 1:5 merger ) , are now mixed also with younger stars so that the avr is overall steeper , even when only 20% age errors are included : the heating index is increased from 0.51 @xmath25 0.04 to 0.62 @xmath25 0.06 . with such large error bars , though , g106 might still be consistent with the milky way .    in all galaxies , for the oldest stars ,",
    "age errors introduce significant changes to the avr : @xmath1is lowered because the truly hot and old stars are now mixed with younger and colder stars , and because these young stars are more numerous . with age errors , the jumps in @xmath1seen for the oldest stars",
    "are then considerably smoothened , and might be missed by surveys .",
    "to illustrate that point , we show in figure [ fig : sigma_mw ] a comparison between the avr in the solar neighbourhood from the geneva - copenhagen survey ( gcs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to one of our simulated galaxies .",
    "the observed avr shows a smooth increase of @xmath1with age , with no jump for old stars , and a @xmath1of about 30 km  s@xmath2for the oldest stars .",
    "this observation might seem in contradiction with other studies finding @xmath1@xmath26 km  s@xmath2for the oldest stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or similarly high values for populations with high [ @xmath5/fe ] ratios @xcite .",
    "however , the gcs sample is limited to a small volume around the sun , and contains very few metal - poor stars ( typically [ fe / h ] @xmath27 ) , which are the stars for which @xcite find @xmath1@xmath28 40 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "in addition , when selecting only stars close to the disc mid - plane ( @xmath29 pc ) in our g92 simulation , we show in figure [ fig : sigma_mw ] that even if a jump in @xmath1is present for old stars , this jump is totally erased when 30% age errors are included , and the simulated galaxy matches the observed avr very well . in this simulation , we find that the absence of a jump is both the consequence of the age errors and of the selection of a sample close to the disc plane , dominated by kinematically cold , thin disc stars ( in figure [ fig : avr ] , which includes all stars of a given age , adding age errors is not enough to totally erase the jump ) .",
    "this shows that in this sense , our simulations are consistent with observations of the solar neighbourhood , and that even if a jump in @xmath1were present in the milky way for old stars , it might not be detected by surveys limited to a small volume and with large age errors .      by contrast , the galaxies undergoing a merger show jumps in their avrs , that appear at ages corresponding to the end of the merger .",
    "this is clearly seen for g22 and g102 . for g48 , where the merger mass ratio is about twice higher than in g22 ,",
    "the jump is not so sharp , and a lot of time is needed for the gas to cool down again : it takes about 2 gyrs for the velocity dispersion to decrease after the galaxies merge .",
    "it is interesting that even the small 1:101:15 mergers leave a well defined signature on the avr ( figure [ fig : avr ] , bottom row ) .",
    "we also note here that mergers affect disc kinematics at all radii ( as also found by @xcite ) , while the fly - by in g47 only affects outer regions .",
    "whether this is a general feature of mergers vs fly - bys would need to be verified with larger samples of simulations .",
    "these results are consistent with those of @xcite , where mergers were similarly found to create jumps in the avr , and are also consistent with idealized studies of the effect of mergers on disc kinematics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , contrary to quiescent galaxies , blurring the ages has a greater effect on the shape of the avr for galaxies with mergers ( black lines in figure [ fig : avr ] ) .",
    "the jumps are considerably smoothened , so that they do not trace exactly the end of mergers anymore ( especially for 30% errors ) .",
    "note also that for g22 the jumps actually becomes far less noticeable for age errors of 30% , which suggests that errors on ages of 20% or less are critical to detecting the traces of minor mergers in the observed avr .      for young stars at 2@xmath24 and the stellar surface density at that same radius ( top panel ) as well as the local star formation rate surface density ( bottom panel ) for all seven galaxies .",
    "both @xmath1and the sfr are defined as corresponding to the last 500 myr of evolution before @xmath9.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] for young stars at 2@xmath24 and the stellar surface density at that same radius ( top panel ) as well as the local star formation rate surface density ( bottom panel ) for all seven galaxies .",
    "both @xmath1and the sfr are defined as corresponding to the last 500 myr of evolution before @xmath9.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    for our seven galaxies , we find that the youngest stars ( age @xmath30 500 myr ) have a vertical velocity dispersion that varies between 10 and 33 km  s@xmath2at 2 @xmath24 . in all galaxies ,",
    "this value declines at increasing galactocentric distances , as shown in paper i ( figure 6 ) .",
    "for instance at 3 @xmath24 , @xmath1for young stars varies between 7 and 23 km  s@xmath2depending on the galaxy .",
    "it is likely that stars in our simulations are born too kinematically hot , because we do not fully resolve the structure of the inter - stellar medium . in the solar neighbourhood ,",
    "@xcite find that the bluest ( i.e. , youngest ) stars have a @xmath1of only 6 @xmath25 1 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this value is similar to the velocity dispersion of molecular clouds : @xcite measured a cloud - cloud velocity dispersion of 7.8 @xmath25 0.6 km  s@xmath2for clouds within 3  kpc of the sun .",
    "this dispersion depends on cloud mass , and the most massive gmcs have a cloud - cloud velocity dispersion of only 4 km  s@xmath2@xcite .",
    "if stars are born with such low velocity dispersions , they are then heated to @xmath1@xmath3 1015 km  s@xmath2within a few hundred million years ( see also figure [ fig : observations ] ) .",
    "this heating can be very fast : in an idealized simulation of a milky - way type galaxy evolving in isolation , @xcite find that stars initially born with a total velocity dispersion of 10 km  s@xmath2are heated to 15 km  s@xmath2 in only 10 myr . assuming an isotropic velocity dispersion , this translates into a @xmath1at birth of 5.8 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "to obtain such a cold stellar component , they used a sub - parsec resolution ( down to 0.05  pc ) , that we can not achieve in cosmological simulations ( our resolution is 150 pc ) .",
    "it seems however that even if stars are not formed very cold , and even if we do not resolve that phase of intense early heating , the values of @xmath1we obtain at 0.51  gyr are reasonable compared to the milky way : in four of our simulations , young stars have a @xmath1between 10 and 17 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "our three other galaxies ( g47 , g48 , and g22 ) have a higher @xmath1for their young stars , up to 33 km  s@xmath2for g22 .",
    "these reflect a higher gas velocity dispersion for these galaxies .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : sigma_young ] , what they have in common is both a higher stellar surface density , as well as higher star formation rate surface density , compared to the kinematically colder galaxies .",
    "a higher surface density has been shown to increase gas velocity dispersion through gravitational instabilities @xcite .",
    "another source of turbulence is the feedback from supernovae explosions , that increases with the star formation rate .",
    "@xcite showed that the atomic gas velocity dispersion does not depend on the sfr surface density up to a threshold corresponding to a starburst regime : for sfr densities greater than 0.51@xmath31m@xmath7yr@xmath2 kpc@xmath32 , the atomic gas velocity dispersion increases with the sfr density ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , this threshold value is similar to the sfr density we find in our kinematically hottest galaxies , suggesting that feedback could be the source of the high velocity dispersion in the gas disc of these galaxies .",
    "finally , it is also possible part of the heating is provided by satellite galaxies , either merging with the discs , or simply orbiting around the main galaxies .",
    "it has also been observed that for molecular gas , the cloud - cloud velocity dispersion decreases with radius , and differs among local galaxies @xcite ; it is roughly twice smaller than the atomic gas velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "plausibly , different galaxies could have a different @xmath1for their young stars .",
    "in simulations , though , the gas velocity dispersion is also the result of numerical effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite compared the vertical velocity dispersion in various simulations performed with different codes , resolutions and recipes .",
    "they find a `` floor '' in @xmath1of 1520 km  s@xmath2even in high resolution simulations ( 50 pc ) , except when the star formation threshold is increased from 0.1 cm@xmath14 to 100 cm@xmath14 .",
    "our simulations are difficult to directly compare to the above results , because @xmath1varies as a function of radius and from one galaxy to another .",
    "what we find is that an increase of the resolution by a factor of 2 does not change our results ( see section 6 ) .",
    "this could mean that a much higher ( sub - parsec ) resolution would be necessary to successfully reproduce a very low @xmath1for stars at birth ( as in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we also find that increasing the star formation threshold from 1 to 5 h cm@xmath14 decreases the overall normalization of the avr ( because we did not increase the star formation efficiency , so that the total mass is lower ) , but does not change its shape , in particular there is no fast heating for young stars .",
    "at birth for a sample of mono - age populations in four of our simulated galaxies . the bottom panel shows the heating rate @xmath33 for the same populations , where @xmath33 is defined by @xmath34 .",

    "we find in all cases that 89 gyr old stars form a different population , and are born significantly hotter than younger stars .",
    "they trace the end of a violent , high redshift phase of star formation . for g47 and g106",
    ", this initial phase extends a bit longer , with stars still being born hot at ages of 78 gyr .",
    "for instance , for g106 , around 10% of stars of that age and at that radius are accreted from satellites , and while the interactions contribute to disc heating , the total @xmath1for these hot populations is dominated by the high @xmath1at birth for stars born within the galaxy itself .",
    "after that phase of mergers , the younger stars are then generally born with a relatively constant @xmath1 , even though a slight decrease of the birth @xmath1with time can usually be noticed ( figure [ fig : sigma_birth ] ) .",
    "we study how each mono - age population is heated by following the time evolution to @xmath9 of the vertical velocity dispersion of its stars ( again , for stars being at 2@xmath24 at @xmath9 ) .",
    "disc heating can be modelled as a diffusion process in velocity space , in which case we can write @xmath34 ( with @xmath36 and @xmath37 the values at birth ) .",
    "@xmath33 is the diffusion coefficient , or the heating rate , and is plotted on the bottom panel of figure [ fig : sigma_birth ] for a sample of mono - age populations ( we simply measure it from the difference between @xmath38 at birth and at @xmath9 ) .",
    "these heating rates are generally below 200 km@xmath39s@xmath32gyr@xmath2 .",
    "they differ between galaxies : the lowest values are achieved for g92 and g106 ( with @xmath40  km@xmath39s@xmath32gyr@xmath2 for most mono - age populations ) , while g47 and g37 undergo more heating ( @xmath41  100150 km@xmath39s@xmath32gyr@xmath2 ) . while part of the heating could be due to spurious numerical effects ( see discussion in section [ sec - resolution ] )",
    ", such numerical effects should be present in all simulations , still allowing comparisons between simulations .",
    "for instance the much larger heating rate found in g37 compared to g92 suggests that this larger heating has a physical and not numerical origin .    for quiescent galaxies the slope of the avr in our simulations",
    "is thus governed by two separate effects : the oldest stars are born hot , while the rest of the disc ( with ages under 8 gyr ) is mostly born with a similar @xmath1and subsequently heated .",
    "these effects combine to produce a continuously rising @xmath1with increasing age .",
    "this differs from the picture presented in @xcite , where the vertical structure of the disc is mostly imprinted at birth ( with also some subsequent heating ) .",
    "this could be the result of a different simulation technique ( potentially for instance a stronger supernova feedback in their simulations ) , with young stars maybe born too hot so that there is not much room for subsequent heating .",
    "in the simulations presented in this paper , the relatively high @xmath1for young stars , and the increase of @xmath1with age for stars in galaxies with quiescent merger histories could both be numerical artefacts . in the milky way",
    ", the exact shape of the avr is debated , but some studies find a low @xmath1for young stars , and a rapid increase of @xmath1 in the first gyr . if young stars are too hot in the simulations , we might just simply miss that first phase of intense heating and just have slower , more regular heating .",
    "the velocity dispersion of stars at birth can be affected by the resolution of the simulation , by the recipe for star formation ( and in particular the value of the gas density threshold above which stars are formed ) , by the recipe for supernova feedback ( affecting the gas velocity dispersion ) , and also by our gas dynamics algorithm itself . in turn , subsequent heating is probably only affected by the resolution .",
    "low resolution can result in significant two - body heating , leading to equipartition of energy between rotational and random motion , thus thickening discs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "massive dark matter particles are efficient at scattering stellar disc particles @xcite , and also at increasing the gas thermal energy @xcite",
    ". the effects on gas should however be negligible for dark matter particle masses below @xmath42 m@xmath7@xcite , which is the case for all modern zoom - in cosmological simulations .",
    "the heating of the stellar disc should also be limited for halos containing a few million dark matter particles .",
    "for instance , @xcite show discs undergoing only some minor heating in simulations using 2 million particles with each a mass of @xmath43 m@xmath7(similar to the dark matter particle mass in our simulations ) . note also that @xcite show that halo black holes with a mass of @xmath6 m@xmath7are not efficient at heating discs . compared to @xcite",
    ", our use of a particle - mesh technique should reduce heating even further ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for modern simulations",
    ", @xcite argues that the most important source of numerical heating is actually the interactions between disc particles themselves , not between disc and halo .",
    "this effect is strongly dependent on the number of particles in the disc , and a few million disc particles are required to limit relaxation in simulated discs . while this result is not directly relevant for our simulations because we use a different simulation technique , the fact that all our simulated discs contain a few million stellar particles is encouraging .",
    "finally , in addition to relaxation effects , resolution also influences the growth of non - axisymmetric features in discs @xcite , and the properties of infalling satellites , both potential sources of heating . in the end",
    ", however , @xcite found that resolution did not have a strong impact on the avr in their simulated galaxies , while increasing the star formation threshold from 0.1 to 100 h cm@xmath14 strongly decreased the velocity dispersion of young stars .",
    "we have tested the effect of resolution and star formation threshold on one of the simulated galaxies from the parent sample of @xcite .",
    "part of the results from these tests were already presented in appendix a of @xcite , where it was found that the increased resolution did not modify the stellar mass and radial density profile of that simulated galaxy .",
    "we here extend these tests to the avr .",
    "the resolution test consists in a twice higher spatial resolution ( corresponding to 75 pc ) , and a mass resolution increased by a factor of 6 ( the mass of a gas particle is then 2500 m@xmath7 ) .",
    "the test of the star formation threshold consists in increasing this threshold by a factor of 5 in the simulation at standard resolution ( this moves the threshold from 1 to 5 h cm@xmath14 ) .",
    "a twice higher resolution only has a very small impact on the avr ( figure [ fig : resolution_test ] ) .",
    "we find that the @xmath1of young stars is similar to values at standard resolution , and the evolution of @xmath1with age also has the same shape .",
    "it just seems that @xmath1is consistently 12 km  s@xmath2lower at high resolution , but this does not reconcile our simulations with observations of a fast rising avr for small ages in the milky way .",
    "note also that the constant offset of @xmath1values at higher resolution indicates that whatever the heating mechanisms are , they are not strongly affected by resolution ( at least , for the resolutions tested here ) .",
    "increasing the threshold for star formation has a stronger effect on the simulated galaxy , partly because we did not increase the star formation efficiency so that the overall number of stars formed is lower , and the total stellar mass is only 80% of the mass at standard resolution . with the higher threshold ,",
    "the overall values of @xmath1are thus shifted to lower values .",
    "in particular , @xmath1for young stars becomes 14 km  s@xmath2instead of 20 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "however , the shape of the avr is not affected , in particular there is no fast heating from 0 to 1 gyr .",
    "if we arbitrarily re - scale all the values of @xmath1to match the values of @xmath1for young stars in the standard simulation , we then find a good match between both simulations .",
    "recently , radial migration has been proposed as a source of disc heating @xcite , but we find no evidence for this in our simulations ( as also discussed in @xcite and @xcite , and is consistent with @xcite ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : sigma_birthplace ] , we show the fractional contribution of different types of stars ( born in - situ , formed in the inner disc , formed in the outer disc ) to the total @xmath1of each mono - age population .",
    "we find that for stars younger than 78 gyr , the stars born in - situ mostly determine the total @xmath1(the total @xmath1only differs from the @xmath1of in - situ stars by less than 10% in all cases ) . similarly to the findings by minchev et al .",
    "( 2012 , their figure 5 ) , stars coming from the inner disc tend to have a slightly larger @xmath1 , and the opposite is true for stars from the outer disc .",
    "the net effect of migration is however to slightly cool the disc , because the heating from inner - disc stars is more than cancelled by the cooling from outer disc stars . only in the very outer disc",
    "does the heating from outwards migrators dominate , creating some flaring @xcite .",
    "we emphasize here the importance of considering both inwards and outwards migrators when studying the effect of migration on disc heating or thickening .    for the oldest stars , though , stars coming from the outer regions are the hottest .",
    "this is because the early mergers affect more significantly the outer disc , creating a flared morphology .",
    "the outwards migration of cold but old stars from the inner disc is shown by @xcite to be a key ingredient in reproducing some chemo - dynamical features observed in the rave and segue surveys ( namely , the low vertical velocity dispersion for the most alpha - rich stars ) .",
    "ruling out migration as a source of heating at a radius of 2@xmath24 still leaves a lot of possible sources of heating in the simulated discs .",
    "we investigate these sources of heating in the following sections .              to elucidate the mechanisms for heating , for each of the four galaxies of the previous section , we study the time evolution of one mono - age population , composed of the stars born at times between 8 and 8.5 gyr , and that are found in a ring around 2@xmath24 at @xmath44 gyr .",
    "the first possible mechanism we study is simply heating due to disc growth ( i.e. , mass accretion ) . indeed , from the vertical jeans equation for an isothermal sheet with a flat rotation curve",
    ", one can see that the vertical velocity dispersion depends on the disc surface density and the scale - height @xcite : @xmath45 consequently , in a disc with an increasing surface density , @xmath1 is expected to increase with time ( under the conservative assumption that the scale - height remains constant ) .",
    "this is an effect that is not traditionally considered in papers studying heating ( these papers usually focus on pre - assembled galaxies , whose mass does not evolve ) , although it has already been shown by @xcite and villalobos et al ( 2010 ) that an increase of the mid - plane density leads to adiabatic heating in the disc .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : hydrostatic ] the time evolution of the baryonic surface density ( i.e. , including both gas and stars , which both contribute to the gravity in the disc plane ) within an annulus at 2@xmath24 ( up to @xmath46 of 3 kpc ) .",
    "we find that over the 5 gyr that we consider , the surface density only increases by @xmath310% for g106 and g92 , but it increases by 65 to 75% for the other two galaxies .",
    "this could be an important source of heating .",
    "the exact contribution to the increase of @xmath1 actually depends on how the scale - height of the population evolves with time ( middle panel , figure [ fig : hydrostatic ] ) .",
    "in all cases , @xmath47 increases with time , with large differences between galaxies .",
    "this increase of @xmath47 with time is unexpected if the vertical action is conserved ( which should be the case for adiabatic changes of the gravitational potential ) . indeed , using the epicycle approximation , the vertical action can be written as ( see e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath48 where @xmath49 is an approximation to the vertical energy @xmath50 and @xmath51 , the vertical epicyclic frequency , is proportional to @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the mid - plane density .",
    "consequently , to conserve the vertical action , when the disc density increases and @xmath1increases , then the scale - height has to decrease .",
    "the fact that we measure an increase of @xmath47 then means that the vertical action is not being conserved as a function of time .",
    "this could be due either to a non - adiabatic growth of the disc mass or to non - axisymmetric features .",
    "note that @xcite find that the vertical action is not perfectly conserved , even for simulated discs that do not accrete mass with time ( despite computing the action very carefully ) . for a growing disc ,",
    "@xcite have shown that only the sum of the vertical and radial action is conserved , and not the vertical action itself ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this makes it difficult to estimate the contribution of gravity - driven heating to the increase of @xmath1(and even more so because it is not the only heating mechanism present as explained in the next section ) .",
    "we provide a rough estimate of how much of the heating can be attributed to the increased surface density , by computing a gravity - driven @xmath1 , using the values of the surface density as a function of time , and assuming that the scale - height remains fixed at its initial value .",
    "these are the dashed lines in figure [ fig : hydrostatic ] , which show that the increase in surface density contributes to the heating rate by only 5% for g92 and 14% for g106 ( their surface density evolves very little ) . on the other hand",
    ", it contributes by 37% and 57% to the heating in g37 and g47 , respectively .",
    "since these contributions are sub - dominant , in the next section , we investigate additional sources of heating .      a possible diagnostic of heating mechanisms is the ratio of vertical to radial velocity dispersions . in figure",
    "[ fig : sigma_evol ] we show the time evolution of @xmath1 , of @xmath54and of @xmath55 for the populations studied in the previous section ( stars born between @xmath20 and 8.5 gyr ) . in all galaxies ,",
    "we find a steady increase of @xmath1 with time , with the possible exception of g106 where @xmath1 seems to saturate to @xmath56 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "we similarly find that @xmath54 increases with time ( with a saturation at @xmath57 km  s@xmath2for g37 over the last 3 gyr of evolution ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath55 ratio has a complex behaviour , suggesting different sources of heating from one galaxy to another ( and confirming that most of the heating is not simply numerical ) .            for g47 , g92 and g106",
    ", @xmath55 decreases over the 5 gyr that we consider . for g37",
    ", @xmath55 first decreases for 1.5 gyr , and then returns to its initial value .",
    "these patterns are not consistent with numerical heating : @xcite shows that @xmath55 increases strongly for disc undergoing numerical heating ( and in simulations with large number of particles , @xmath55 evolves very little ) .",
    "a decrease of @xmath55 is also inconsistent with the models of heating by gmcs and halo black holes by @xcite , where @xmath55 is either constant or slightly increasing with time .",
    "spiral arms and bars are more efficient at heating discs in the radial direction @xcite .",
    "vertical heating can then be obtained if the radial heating is redistributed in the vertical direction by gmcs or other massive objects @xcite .",
    "@xcite also observe vertical heating linked with the presence of spiral arms , and speculate that even in the absence of gmcs the radial heating could be redistributed in the vertical direction by weak bending waves ( as proposed by @xcite ) .    a very likely source of heating in our simulations could then be the combination of spiral arms with either overdensities in the disc and/or weak bending waves .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : zmean ] that such bending waves are indeed present in the simulations .",
    "we show the mean height above the mid - plane of stellar particles as a function of time for an annulus at 2@xmath24 in each simulated disc , and we find low levels of vertical oscillations for all galaxies .",
    "interestingly , these bending waves are much stronger for g37 , for which the evolution of @xmath55 is also different . in this case , we suspect that the late increase of @xmath55 could be due to the bending waves themselves @xcite .",
    "@xcite also show that bending waves increase @xmath55 mostly through an increase of @xmath1 , which is what we find for g37 where at late times @xmath1increases while @xmath54remains approximately constant ( note that this was also observed by @xcite ) .",
    "the bending waves themselves could be due to small satellites orbiting the simulated galaxies @xcite , but could also naturally arise from internal instabilities ( that are predicted to occur when @xmath55 is below @xmath3 0.4 ) , or even be induced by the spiral arms @xcite .",
    "we conclude from the analysis in this section that disc heating in our simulations is due neither to numerical effects , nor to radial migration .",
    "the contributions to the heating vary from one galaxy to another , and include heating due to disc growth , and heating due to a combination of spiral arms and bars coupled with overdensities in the disc and vertical bending waves .",
    "( up to @xmath46 of 1 kpc ) .",
    "all galaxies show some oscillations ( corresponding to bending modes ) , which are strongest for g37.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "we study the age - velocity relation in a sample of seven simulated disc galaxies . all galaxies first undergo an active phase of mergers at high redshift , creating in all cases a thick stellar component with a high velocity dispersion . amongst the old stars , we find that most of them are actually born kinematically hot , with an additional contribution of accreted stars . at lower redshift ( corresponding to stellar ages smaller than 89 gyr ) , three of the simulated galaxies have a quiescent history while the others have various types of mergers .",
    "we find that in the quiescent galaxies @xmath1increases smoothly with age .",
    "when fitted with a power law , we find heating indices close to 0.5 , making our simulated galaxies consistent with results from the geneva - copenhagen survey for the solar neighbourhood @xcite , rather than with observations suggesting that disc heating saturates after a few gyrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "note that such a gradual heating was also found in other zoom cosmological simulations , as for instance shown by @xcite or @xcite , even if they do not measure the heating index in their simulations .",
    "by contrast with @xcite , though , we mostly find that the slope of the avr is not imprinted at birth , but is due to heating . while we can not pin down the exact mechanisms responsible for that heating , we show that radial migration is not one of them . because of the combined contribution of hotter stars coming from the inner disc and cooler stars coming from the outer disc",
    ", we even find that the total effect of migration is to very slightly cool the disc , at least for the radius we examined , and for stars younger than @xmath3 8 gyr . for older stars , the effect is reversed ,",
    "because stars coming from the inner disc are cooler : this is due to early mergers creating a flared structure for the old stars .    finally , we find that @xmath1is very sensitive to mergers ( see also e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : even 110 to 115 mergers create jumps in the age - velocity relation .",
    "this can in theory be used to probe the merger history of the milky way .",
    "however , we find that errors of 30% on stellar ages , even if they do not affect the shape of the avr for quiescent galaxies ( except for the oldest stars , for which age errors significantly decrease the measured @xmath1 ) , can significantly blur the signatures of mergers ( errors of 20% or less are necessary to properly detect these signatures ) .",
    "stronger constraints on the history of the milky way can be obtained by combining the avr with the structure of mono - abundance populations @xcite .",
    "as discussed in paper i , our simulations , combined with current data , favour a very quiescent history for the milky way in the last 9 gyr , with a potential contribution of mergers to the build - up of the thickest and oldest disc components .",
