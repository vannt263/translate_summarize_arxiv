    "grbs are thought to be caused by a violent event such as the collapse of a massive star ( for long duration bursts ) or the coalescence of two compact objects ( for short duration bursts ) .",
    "these progenitors result in the immediate formation of a black hole which powers a relativistic jet pointing in the direction of the observer . in the standard fireball model variability in the lorentz factor of",
    "the outflow causes internal shocks which produce the prompt flash of x - ray and gamma - ray emission ( rees & mszros 1994 ; sari & piran 1997 ) .",
    "when the relativistic outflow sweeps up a sufficient amount of external material , the ejecta is decelerated causing a forward shock which is primarily responsible for the multi - wavelength afterglow emission ( katz 1994 ; mszros & rees 1997;sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) .",
    "alternatively there is a model that suggests a black hole may not be formed immediately , but instead that a transitory highly magnetised rapidly rotating pulsar , or magnetar , may form ( usov 1992 ; thompson 1994 ) , before the star collapses to a black hole ( rosswog & ramirez - ruiz 2003 ) .",
    "proto - magnetars have very high magnetic field strengths of @xmath0 g ( duncan & thompson 1992 ; duncan 1998 ) which are thought to be a consequence of millisecond rotation at birth in a core - collapse supernova .",
    "values up to @xmath1 g are implied by observations ( stella  2005 ) .",
    "such objects are considered a possible central engine for grbs due to their large rotational energy reservoir , e@xmath2 .",
    "also they can be associated with supernovae , as are long grbs , and their winds are thought to become relativistic like a grb jet .",
    "zhang & mszros ( 2001 ) investigated the observational signature of a spinning - down magnetar as the grb central engine . adopting an approximate magnetic dipole radiation model",
    ", they infer that the spindown power of the proto - magnetar could produce a period of prolonged constant luminosity followed by a @xmath3 decay .",
    "they considered the modification of the forward shock dynamics by magnetar spindown and predicted a distinct achromatic feature .",
    "a similar model was discussed earlier by dai & lu ( 1998 ) who considered the energy injection to the forward shock by a millisecond pulsar with much a weaker magnetic field .",
    "this model is one of the candidates to interpret the majority of the x - ray plateaus observed in many swift grb afterglows ( zhang et al .",
    "2006 ; nousek et al .",
    "this model does not invoke the internal dissipation of the magnetar wind . on the other hand ,",
    "if the magnetar wind indeed dissipates internally before hitting the blastwave , it is possible that it would generate an `` internal '' x - ray plateau whose x - ray luminosity tracks the spindown luminosity if the energy dissipation and radiation efficiency remain constant . if the magnetar undergoes direct collapse into a black hole before spin down , then the x - ray plateau would be followed by a very steep decay .",
    "this is the light - curve feature we investigate and hereafter we call this feature an `` internal plateau '' .    in the  era the early x - ray light curve , observed within the first few hours of the grb , has been found to be complex ( e.g. nousek  2006 ; obrien  2006 ) .",
    "the so - called canonical x - ray light curve observed in a significant fraction of grbs ( evans  2009 ) has a short period of fast decay , often with flares superimposed , which are usually over within the first hour after the burst .",
    "this is followed by a shallower decay period lasting from a few hours up to a day with a temporal decay index @xmath4 ( where the x - ray flux , @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the spectral index ) .",
    "after this x - ray plateau there is a smooth transition to a modest power law decay of @xmath7 .",
    "willingale  ( 2007 ) found that the x - ray light curve of most grbs , including those of the canonical form , can be represented by two components  the prompt and afterglow  plus flares ( section 2 ) .",
    "however , we find that in a small minority of bursts a period of relatively constant emission ( compared to the general lightcurve ) followed by a steep decline can be identified which does not fit this phenomenological model .",
    "the observed feature instead resembles the proposed signature of a magnetar spin down .",
    "troja  ( 2007 ) found such a feature dominates the x - ray light curve of grb 070110 from @xmath8 seconds in and proposed it was due to a spinning down millisecond pulsar .",
    "starling  ( 2008 ) found a similar , earlier feature in grb 070616 ending at about 600 seconds .",
    "liang et al . ( 2007 ) systematically analyzed a sample of x - ray plateaus and identified several more plateaus that are followed by decays with slopes steeper than @xmath9 .",
    "it is the combination of a plateau followed by a steep decay which distinguishes these from the canonical behaviour .",
    "we regard these objects as candidate internal plateaus .",
    "we have conducted a systematic investigation of the grb x - ray light curves observed by  up to the end of 2008 . using an automated fitting procedure in this paper we identify 10 bursts which may have an emission component powered by magnetar spin - down dominating the light curve for some period of time in the form of an internal plateau . assuming this internal plateau is caused by the spinning down of a magnetar we use its properties to constrain the magnetic field and initial spin period of the magnetar . the criteria for selecting those grbs with internal plateaus",
    "is discussed in section 2 .",
    "section 3 compares the properties of the internal plateaus with the magnetar model and we discuss the implications in section 4 .",
    "over 90% of grb x - ray light curves are well described by a two component model with a prompt and an afterglow component as described in willingale  ( 2007 ) .",
    "these components are described by an exponential that relaxes into a power law ; this function can be expressed for the prompt component as shown in equation 1 .",
    "large flares were masked out of the fitting procedure .",
    "although apparently bright , such flares account for only about 10% of the total fluence in most cases .",
    "the prompt emission rises with the time constant @xmath10 and later the emission transitions from an exponential to a power law at point ( t@xmath11 , f@xmath11 ) , where the subscript @xmath12 refers to the prompt component of the emission ( willingale  2007 ) .",
    "the exponential and power law decay are both controlled by the index @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14    for this investigation we are interested in those grbs whose early x - ray emission could not be adequately fitted by the willingale model .",
    "thus we fitted all the  grbs with the model and then examined all cases where the model fails .",
    "the x - ray light curves were derived from the bat and xrt data using the methods described in obrien  ( 2006 ) and willingale  ( 2007 ) .",
    "bat & xrt light curves were derived for each grb using the nasa s heasarc software .",
    "the bat data were extracted over the 15 - 150 kev band and the bat spectra were produced using the task batbinevt .",
    "an estimate of the fractional systematic error in each bat spectral channel from the bat calibration database ( caldb ) was added to the spectra using the batphasyserr command .",
    "the corresponding response matrices were generated by the command batdrmgen .",
    "xrt data were extracted over the 0.3 - 10 kev band .",
    "the light curves were corrected for point spread function ( psf ) losses and exposure variations .",
    "the xrt spectra were extracted using the xselect software and the spectra was grouped to have at least 20 counts per channel .",
    "the relevant ancillary response files were generated using the task xrtmkarf .",
    "uvot data were extracted using the task uvotevtlc . the v , b , u and white magnitudes were corrected for galactic extinction along the line of sight and then converted to monochromatic fluxes at the central wavelength of each filter .",
    "the effective mid - wavelength was taken to be 4450  for the white filter .    in fig .",
    "[ fitexamples ] we show an example of a grb that the willingale model fits well ( grb 060427 ) and one which it does not ( grb 060510b ) and instead demonstrates an internal plateau where the flux remains constant with small fluctuations for about 360 seconds .",
    "it has been suggested that instead of a plateau there is a group of flares very close together , however maintaining a high level of flux for hundreds of seconds with the peak of each flare having almost identical flux seems unlikely .",
    "some of the grbs for which the model fails were those where a pre - cursor triggered the bat instrument or where very large flares were not fitted .",
    "we examined all of the fitted light curves to remove such cases . to be included in the internal plateau sample a grb must have    1 .   a lightcurve that could not be adequately fitted by the willingale model .",
    "2 .   a significant period of time",
    "during which the x - ray flux is relatively constant , i.e. at least a third of a decade long .",
    "a convincing steep decline following the internal plateau which falls by a factor of ten where @xmath15 @xmath16 4 , so that the emission is likely caused by central engine activity and is not the canonical x - ray plateau .",
    "this gives 10 grbs with light curve internal plateau features that resemble the spin - down magnetar model discussed in zhang & mszros ( 2001 ) .",
    "the 10 grbs which form our internal plateau sample and values of interest such as the redshift and plateau limunosity are listed in table 1 . for",
    "the grbs with an observed redshift in table 1 , the mean redshift is 3.96 , significantly higher than the  mean redshift of 2.22 for all grbs with measured redshift .",
    "a k - s test with a confidence level of 90@xmath17 could not prove the that the distribution of these redshifts are inconstient with the  redshift distribution for all grbs with measured redshift .",
    "the grbs which display an internal plateau are shown in fig .",
    "[ sample ] and are discussed briefly below .",
    "grb 080310 has emission that could be an internal plateau followed by a steep decline , which seems to rise above the underlying emission . also shortly after the internal plateau there is a flare which peaks at the same flux as the internal plateau . while in this grb the proposed internal plateau could be due to a multiple number of flares ( obrien  in preparation ) , we include it in our sample .",
    "grb 071021 has a possible internal plateau dominating the early x - ray lightcurve .",
    "this is the shortest proposed internal plateau in the sample lasting about 105 seconds .",
    "grb 070721b has a possible internal plateau that dominates early in the lightcurve .",
    "flaring dominates over the internal plateau emission , during the middle of this time interval .",
    "this could signify a brief period of accretion onto the proto - magnetar . ignoring the single flare the emission is similar to that for other internal plateau candidates , so it has been included in the sample .",
    "grb070616 is intriguing in that the emission rises relatively slowly over 100 seconds to a peak , then persists at a fairly constant level before showing a very rapid decline .",
    "grb 070129 is similar to grb 070721b in that it has a possible internal plateau that is interrupted by a flare followed by a steep decline .",
    "grb 070110 displays a canonical early light curve with an initial steep decline , but then exhibits a period of relatively constant emission . following this plateau",
    "the decay is surprisingly steep ( @xmath18 ) decay ( troja  2007 ) .",
    "thus in this case the proto - magnetar survived for much longer than in most of the other grbs .",
    "grb 060607a appears to follow the canonical lightcurve with a `` normal '' x - ray plateau with multiple flares preventing a good fit with the two component model .",
    "however at late times the decay following the plateau is too steep for an afterglow and is consistient with @xmath15 @xmath19 .",
    "this is unlikely to be explained by anything other than central engine activity and thus has been included in the internal plateau sample . as in grb 070110 ,",
    "the internal plateau seen in grb 060607a dominates the burst emission unusually late starting at about 900 seconds when ( from table 1 ) most of the other internal plateaus have ended .",
    "grb 060510b ( also shown in fig .  [ fitexamples ] ) is very similar to grb 070616 . in both cases",
    "the proposed internal plateau dominates the emission from the burst very early on .",
    "grb 060202 displays unusual emission attributed to an internal plateau between 325 and 766 seconds .",
    "the fluctuations during this plateau are unusually regular .",
    "grb 050904 has multiple flares at early and late times , but at about 230 seconds there is a period where the emission appears relatively constant followed by a steep decay , leading it to be included in the sample as a possible internal plateau .",

    "[ timeluminosity ] , which suggests that higher luminosity plateaus are generally of shorter duration .",
    "there are too few grbs in the late internal plateau group to draw any firm conclusions .",
    "their luminosities are lower , but not much lower than that of the early internal plateau group .",
    "we have identified a small number of grbs which display a period of time during which the x - ray emission shows a smooth plateau followed by a steep decline . the internal plateau is challenging to interpret using accretion models as it requires a constant power jet component with a roughly constant radiation efficiency .",
    "this possibility has been examined by kumar  ( 2008a ) , who suggest that the prompt emission of a grb may be caused by the accretion of the outer regions of a stellar core and that the x - ray plateau could be caused by the fall - back and accretion of the stellar envelope .",
    "this model has problems accounting for the steep declines seen after the plateau . even assuming a sharp edge to the region being accreted , the steepest decline expected is @xmath30 ( kumar et al .",
    "2008b ) .    here",
    "we argue that a more natural explanation may come from the magnetar model which predicts a period of constant spin - down power .",
    "this model starts with the assumption that the neutron star accretor can power the grb prompt emission which while not certain , is feasible ( usov 1992 ; thompson 1994 ; bucciantini 2007 ) .",
    "comparison of the luminosity and duration of the internal plateaus observed in our grb sample with the dipolar spindown law ( zhang & mszros 2001 ) implies upper limits to the magnetic field strengths close to the maximum allowed for such objects and initial spin periods also close to the maximum allowed to maintain neutron star structural integrity .",
    "the upper limits for the dipolar magnetic field of the magnetar are particularly strong if the emission is strongly beamed .",
    "the largest magnetic fields implied for isotropic emission are consistent with field strengths of @xmath31 g which can be generated in magnetars born with spin of a few milliseconds ( thompson & duncan 1993 ; duncan 1998 ) . a giant flare from sgr 1806 - 20 on @xmath32",
    "december 2004 demonstrated that unless such flares are much rarer than the rate implied by detecting one , magnetars must possess a magnetic field strength of @xmath33 g or higher .",
    "indeed values up to @xmath1 g could not be ruled out ( stella  2005 ) .",
    "for the grb sample in this paper this could allow beaming factors corresponding to jet opening angles of 4 - 10 degrees , consistent with values derived from frail  ( 2001 ) .",
    "the number of grbs that display internal plateau behaviour is very small .",
    "this perhaps is not surprising as we would expect them to only be detectable for quite a narrow combination of magnetic field strength and initial spin period .",
    "these rare features do provide limits on the magnetic fields surrounding the central engine around the grb , and can help advance understanding of the mechanisms behind prompt emission .",
