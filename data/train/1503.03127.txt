    "two main approaches have arisen recently for implementing variational principles in stochastic geometric mechanics . in one of them , sometimes called _ stochastic deformation _",
    "@xcite , the lagrangian in hamilton s principle is the classical one , but it is evaluated on underlying stochastic processes and their mean derivatives .",
    "this perspective was initially motivated by the quantization of classical systems @xcite and a probabilistic version of feynman s path integral approach to quantum mechanics .",
    "the stochastic deformation approach brings to bear the full theory of stochastic partial differential equations ( spde ) . for more details about the history of the applications of this approach ,",

    "we will advocate a simpler , and more restricted approach .",
    "our approach is based on a generalisation in @xcite of earlier work by bismut @xcite , lzaro - cam and ortega @xcite , and bou - rabee and owhadi @xcite for stochastic ordinary differential equations ( sde ) , which unifies their hamiltonian and lagrangian approaches to temporal stochastic dynamics , and extends them to stochastic partial differential equations ( spde ) in the case of cylindrical noise in which the spatial dependence is _ parametric _ , while temporal dependence is stochastic .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that the parametric spatial dependence of the stochastic dynamical variables in the resulting spdes allows essentially finite - dimensional stochastic methods to be applied at each point of space .",
    "this feature allows us to safely assume from the onset that all the objects we introduce in this context are semimartingales . to distinguish between the two approaches",
    ", we will call the approach taken here _ parametric stochastic deformation _ ( p - sd ) .",
    "parametric stochastic partial differential equations ( p - spde ) result in the present approach by applying p - sd to a deterministic variational principle .",
    "these p - spde contain a type of multiplicative , cylindrical , stratonovich noise that depends on both the solution variables and their _",
    "spatial gradients_. this unfamiliar feature does not interfere with the passage to the it representation , though , since the space variable is treated merely as a parameter when dealing with cylindrical noise .",
    "that is , one may regard the cylindrical noise process as a finite dimensional stochastic process parametrized by @xmath0 ( the space variable ) .",
    "then , the stratonovich equation makes analytical sense pointwise , for each fixed @xmath0 .",
    "once this is agreed , then the transformation to it by the standard method also makes sense pointwise in space . for more details about",

    "in this paper we develop an approach for inserting parametric stochastic deformation with cylindrical noise into systems of evolutionary partial differential equations which derive from deterministic variational principles that are invariant under a lie group action .",
    "the corresponding deterministic dynamical systems are called euler - poincar equations .",

    "when the @xmath1 norm is chosen this results in the ch equation @xcite .",

    "we have seen in section [ sec : parametricstochasticdeformations ] that the finite - dimensional peakon solutions for the epdiff partial differential equation in one spatial dimension persist under both parametric stochastic deformation ( p - sd ) and canonical hamiltonian stochastic deformations ( ch - sd ) of the epdiff variational principle .",
    "being both finite - dimensional and canonically hamiltonian , the dynamics of the peakon solution set for epdiff admits the entire range of ch - sd in the sense of @xcite , which includes p - sd but can be more general .",
    "therefore , the peakon solution set offers a finite - dimensional laboratory for comparing the effects of p - sd and ch - sd on the stochastically deformed epdiff spde solution behaviour .",
    "in fact , as it turns out , the peakon solution set for epdiff offers a particularly sensitive assessment of the effects of stochasticity on finite - dimensional solutions of spde . in section [ sec : parametricstochasticdeformations ] , we took advantage of the flexibility of ch - sd to study stochastic peakon - peakon collisions in which noise was introduced into _ only one _ of the peakon position equations ( rather than symmetrically into both of the canonical position equations , as occurs with p - sd ) , while at the same time not introducing any noise into either of the corresponding canonical momentum equations .",
    "the precision and flexibility of the ch - sd approach to stochastic peakon - peakon collision dynamics revealed that its asymmetric case with noise in only one canonical position equation allows the soliton - like singular peakon and pulson solutions of epdiff to interpenetrate and change order on the real line , although this is not possible for the diffeomorphic flow represented by the solutions of the unperturbed deterministic epdiff equation .",
    "this crossing of peakon paths was observed and its statistics were studied in detail for ch - sd in numerical experiments in section  [ sec : numerical experiments ] . in contrast , crossing of peakon paths was _ not _ observed for the corresponding p - sd simulations in which the noise enters symmetrically in both position equations .",
    "crossing of peakon paths was also not observed when stochasticity was added only in the canonical momentum equations , as studied in @xcite .",
    "thus , for the deterministic epdiff , adding stochasticity of _ constant amplitude _ with either ch - sd of p - sd to a finite dimensional invariant solution set has been found to produce different sde solution behaviour . here , the difference has introduced the possibility of a topological change in the order of points moving on a line in the ch - sd approach , while no such change in topology seems to be available via the p - sd subclass .",
    "one can also imagine that changing the level of noise in the p - sd epdiff spde could change the number of peaks or pulsons ; a feature which would not have been available if the level of noise were changed after the reduction to a fixed @xmath108-peakon solution sector .",
    "the intriguing idea of creation of singular epdiff solutions by p - sd noise in the spde is under current investigation .",
    "the investigation of stochastic epdiff in this paper has raised and illustrated a potentially important issue .",
    "the need for assessing the validity of approximating the stochastic solution behaviour of nonlinear spde by sde obtained from adding noise to finite - dimensional projections ( or discretisations ) of the solutions is likely to be encountered quite often in many other circumstances and can be expected to be of frequent future concern . in particular , this issue is likely to occur in considerations of model error in stochastic data assimilation .",
    "for example , the endeavours of computational anatomy must face this issue in the use of the singular solutions of epdiff known as _",
    "landmarks _ in the task of registration of noisy images @xcite .",
    "this issue of the validity of stochastic deformations of finite - dimensional approximations of evolutionary pde is a challenge for continuing research in p - sd of epdiff , as well as in stochastic deformations of more general continuum equations , such as euler s equations for an ideal fluid , or the navier - stokes equations for a viscous fluid .",
    "the present work has shown that the introduction of even constant stochasticity into the equations of motion for _ exact solutions _ ( peakons and pulsons , or landmarks , for epdiff ) can produce unexpected changes in topology of the solution in one dimension .",
