    "renormalization group ( rg ) flow describes the change in the effective behaviour of a quantum field theory as the distance or energy scale is changed . in the wilsonian scheme one starts from a bare theory in the ultraviolet ( uv ) and integrates out high energy degrees of freedom .",
    "the effect of integrating out the high energy degrees of freedom is to redefine or renormalize the bare coupling constants appearing in the lagrangian of the uv theory .",
    "this redefinition is mathematically described as a first order flow equation in the space of coupling constants .",
    "conformal field theories ( cft ) appear as fixed points of this flow .",
    "now given a cft ( uv - cft ) one can perturb this by adding a relevant operator and flow to a new cft ( ir - cft ) in the infrared ( ir ) .",
    "for two dimensional unitary and lorentz invariant quantum field theories it has been shown in @xcite that one can define a positive monotonically decreasing function of the coupling constants along the flow whose values at the fixed points coincide with the central charges of the respective two dimensional cfts .",
    "this positive monotonically decreasing function of the coupling constants is known as a @xmath0-function .",
    "@xmath0-theorem was generalized and proved for higher dimensional field theories in @xcite .",
    "rg flow can also be studied via ads / cft correspondence . in this",
    "set up one usually starts with a bulk theory which has several pure ads critical points .",
    "the bulk theory is usually a classical theory of gravity coupled to matter fields .",
    "rg flow is represented by a domain - wall like solution of the coupled gravity - matter system which interpolates between two ads critical points @xcite.the holographic version of the @xmath0-theorem is proved by showing the existence of a function which decreases monotonically from the uv - ads to the ir - ads as a result of the field equations and gives the central charges when evaluated at the end points of the flow . in all these constructions",
    "null energy condition on the matter stress tensor plays an important role .",
    "the story of the holographic @xmath0-theorem is more interesting when one considers higher derivative corrections to einstein gravity in the bulk .",
    "this was considered in great detail in @xcite .",
    "higher derivative corrections are ubiquitous in low energy effective theories coming from string theory and they are also interesting in their own right as toy models where one can study various thorny issues related to black hole thermodynamics . in an arbitrary theory of gravity described by a local covariant action there is in general be no clear separation between gravity and matter sector .",
    "so matter stress tensor can not be uniquely defined and standard null energy condition has no clear role to play .",
    "this is one of the main obstacles of proving holographic @xmath0-theorem in a general theory as was emphasized in @xcite .",
    "the other point is that even if there is a higher derivative theory of gravity coupled to matter where null energy condition can be imposed unambiguously , sometimes it is not enough to prove holographic @xmath0-theorem and validity of the @xmath0-theorem seems to require additional constraints on the pure gravity sector of the theory @xcite .",
    "this could be a genuine physical constraint on the bulk theory like unitarity but its status is always not so clear @xcite .",
    "so an important problem is to spell out the constraint which needs to be imposed on a theory of gravity so that holographic @xmath0-theorem holds .    in @xcite , a different approach towards holographic rg flow and holographic @xmath0-theorem",
    "was proposed .",
    "the basic observation of @xcite was that causal horizons in pure poincare ads are killing horizons generated by the dilatation vector .",
    "dilatation symmetry is broken along the rg flow and as a result causal horizons in a rg flow geometry are no longer globally killing .",
    "they become killing ( stationary ) in the asymptotic uv and ir region of the rg flow geometry , where scaling is recovered . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the bekenstein - hawking entropy ( density ) of the non - killing causal horizon interpolating between the uv and the ir of the rg flow geometry is a holographic @xmath0-function .",
    "the monotonicity of the @xmath0-function followed from the second law of thermodynamics obeyed by causal horizons in ads @xcite .",
    "based on these observations it was proposed in @xcite that the boundary rg flow is dual to the thermodynamics of causal horizons in ads and the gravity dual of the @xmath0-theorem is the second law of causal horizon thermodynamics .    in this paper we verify this for higher derivative theories of gravity which admit pure @xmath1 as a solution . at",
    "first we test it for higher derivative theories for which an entropy expression exists which satisfies at least the linearized version of the second law .",
    "it has been shown recently @xcite that a general curvature - squared theory of gravity satisfies the linearized second law .",
    "we verify that in these cases the entropy ( density ) evaluated on the spatial slices of the dynamical causal horizon is a holographic @xmath0-function and the gravity dual of the boundary @xmath0-theorem is the linearized second law .",
    "this restricts us to rg flows where the difference between the uv and the ir central charges is small , but there is no restriction on the magnitude of the higher - derivative coupling . in all these cases",
    "the bulk gravity theory is minimally coupled to the matter sector which cause the rg - flow and the matter stress tensor is restricted to satisfy the null - energy condition .",
    "we would like to emphasize that this does _ not _ mean that we restrict to gravity - matter theories which satisfy the null convergence condition for any future directed null vector @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the ricci tensor .",
    "if this condition is satisfied then raychaudhuri equation applied to a hypersurface orthogonal congruence of null geodesics implies that the expansion @xmath4 is monotonically decreasing along the generators of the congruence .",
    "when einstein gravity is minimally coupled to the matter field the null convergence condition is guaranteed if the matter stress tensor satisfies the null energy condition .",
    "however this is not the case if there are higher derivative couplings .",
    "even if the matter field is minimally coupled and the matter stress tensor satisfies the null energy condition , this does not guarantee the null convergence condition due to the presence of the higher derivative terms .",
    "so focusing does not happen and the proof of the second law can not follow the same logic as in the einstein gravity case . ] which is generically violated in all higher - derivative theories of gravity including the ones we are studying .",
    "our next example is @xmath5 gravity where @xmath6 is the ricci scalar . in this case",
    "the entropy expression satisfying the second law to all orders is known @xcite and we construct the holographic @xmath0-function using this .",
    "this is an example of a theory which has fourth order equation of motion , but the bulk theory is still unitary @xcite .",
    "we also study the effect of non - minimal coupling to the matter sector . as an example",
    ", we treat the case of einstein gravity plus scalar matter where in addition to the standard minimal coupling there is also a curvature coupling of the form @xmath7 , where @xmath6 is the ricci scalar . in this case",
    "there is no clean separation between matter and gravity sector and as a result standard null energy condition can not be defined . in such a theory",
    "the second law is known to hold , albeit with an expression which is not the area of a space - like slice of the horizon @xcite . using this expression we prove holographic @xmath0-theorem in a situation where the null - energy condition can not be defined . as a generalization of this",
    "we show that a sufficient condition to ensure holographic @xmath0-theorem in a theory of gravity described by a local covariant action in ads is that the second law of causal horizon thermodynamics be satisfied by the theory .",
    "of the boundary point p in pure ads .",
    "this is just the bulk light - cone of the point p. poincare time runs vertically upward in the diagram.,width=566 ]    in this section we will briefly review the contents of @xcite and discuss some notations . let us consider @xmath8 written in poincare coordinates , ds^2=(-dt^2 + _",
    "i=1^d-1(dx^i)^2 + dz^2 ) where @xmath9 is the @xmath1 radius .",
    "it will be useful to introduce the spherical polar coordinates such that ,    _",
    "i=1^d-1 ( dx^i)^2 = dr^2 + r^2d_d-2 ^ 2    where , @xmath10 is the metric of a unit @xmath11-sphere . in these coordinates , @xmath1-metric is ,    ds^2=(-dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2d_d-2 ^ 2 + dz^2 ) .",
    "this metric has a scaling isometry , @xmath12 , generated by the dilatation vector ,    d=+ +    @xmath13 is null on the hypersurface @xmath14 given by ,    -t^2 + r^2 + z^2 = 0    @xmath14 is a null hypersurface which is left invariant by the flow of @xmath13 and so @xmath14 is a killing horizon generated by @xmath13 .",
    "it is also easy to see that @xmath14 is the boundary of the causal past ( future ) of the point , @xmath15 , in @xmath1 .",

    "@xmath24 is again a null - hypersurface and we can take as its null generator the vector field @xmath25 given by , @xcite        @xmath25 is null on @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is not a killing vector .",
    "it coincides with @xmath13 only asymptotically where scaling is recovered . as a result",
    "the backreacted causal horizon @xmath24 is * no * longer a killing horizon .",
    "it is dynamical in the sense that it has non - zero expansion and shear .",
    "in @xcite it was proposed that the boundary rg - flow is dual to the ( thermo ) dynamics of causal horizons caused by the breaking of the scaling isometry in the bulk . in particular",
    "it was shown in @xcite that if the bulk theory is described by einstein - hilbert action minimally coupled to a scalar field obeying the null - energy condition then the gravity dual of the boundary @xmath0-theorem is the second law of thermodynamics obeyed by causal horizons @xcite .",
    "the holographic @xmath0-function in this framework was given by the bekenstein - hawking entropy density of the dynamical causal horizon ( [ dcausal ] ) .",
    "_ this directly relates the second law for causal horizons in @xmath1 to the unitarity of the boundary theory in the form of @xmath0-theorem_.",
    "we first consider the einstein - gauss - bonnet theory in @xmath26 given by the action , i_gb =- d^5x ( r++(r_r^-4r_r^+r^2 ) ) .",
    "if we minimally couple it to scalar matter which induces the rg - flow , then the equation of motion for this theory is given by , [ met3 ] r_- r g_- g_- h_=t _ where , @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the matter stress tensor .",
    "we have assumed that the matter stress - tensor obeys the null - energy condition .",

    "the induced metric on the space - like slices of ( [ dcausal ] ) becomes , .",
    "] [ hyp ] ds_ind^2= l_ads^2 ( ) ^2 ( d^2 + ^2  d_2 ^ 2 ) = l_ads^2 ( ) ^2 ds_h^3 ^ 2    where @xmath31 is the metric on a unit hyperboloid .",
    "so , r = - ( ) ^2    now following @xcite we take the null generators of the causal horizon as integral curves of @xmath25 defined as ,    [ inte ] = t ,   = r ,   = |z , where @xmath32 is not necessarily an affine parameter .",

    "the monotonicity follows from the linearized second law satisfied by the jm entropy function , but we will check this by explicit calculation . since the jm entropy satisfies",
    "the linearized second law , the @xmath0-function ( [ gbc ] ) constructed out of the jm entropy function is monotonic if we confine ourselves to linearized metric fluctuations . by linearized we mean that the metric fluctuations around the uv - ads is of the same order of magnitude as the matter stress tensor causing the rg flow .",
    "this condition allows us to probe holographic rg flows where the difference between the uv and the ir central charges is small .",
    "this does * not * mean that gauss - bonnet coupling constant @xmath47 is small .",

    "this condition is equivalent to ,    [ ne ] f(z ) ( 1 - 2 f _",
    "f(z))0 .",
    "the fact that we can not prove ( [ monotony ] ) in complete generality using the condition ( [ ne ] ) is just the reflection of the fact that the jm entropy functional satisfies only the linearized second law .",

    "it is the _ entropy density _ of the dynamical causal horizon ( [ dcausal ] ) which plays the role of holographic @xmath0-function and so the positivity is essential for its interpretation as the number of degrees of freedom of the dual field theory along the rg flow .",

    "let us now apply it to our case .",
    "we follow the same strategy as in @xcite and in the previous sections , except that we are now doing it for an arbitrary theory ( [ hac ] ) obeying the second law .",
    "we take the entropy expression ( [ dent ] ) and evaluate it on the space - like cross - section ( [ parahyp ] ) of the non - killing causal horizon ( [ dcausal ] ) .",
    "@xmath32 is the non - affine parameter , parametrizing the null generators ( [ inte ] ) along which the space - like slice @xmath77 $ ] is evolving . the induced metric @xmath75 on @xmath77 $ ] is given by ( [ hyp ] ) .",
    "now in the domain wall geometry all the geometric quantities and the matter fields depend only on the @xmath22 ( or @xmath23 ) coordinate and so is constant on @xmath77 $ ] . as a result @xmath79 is also constant on @xmath77 $ ] although it has non - trivial dependence on @xmath32 through its dependence on @xmath22 ( or @xmath23 ) .",
    "now for the induced metric @xmath75 we get from ( [ hyp ] ) ,    d^d-1y = l_ads^d-1 ( ) ^d-1 dv_h^d-1    where @xmath81 is the volume element of a unit hyperbolic space space .",
    "since the intrinsic coordinates parameterizing the hyperbolic space ( or @xmath77 $ ] ) are comoving , @xmath81 is independent of @xmath32 .",
    "so the second law ( @xmath82 ) can be written as ,    [ monotony ] ( -2l_ads^d-1 ( ) ^d-1 s ) 0    so we define our @xmath0-function to be ,    [ a ] a ( ) = -2l_ads^d-1 ( ) ^d-1 s ( )    the monotonicity of the @xmath0-function , @xmath83 , follows from ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "now we show that at the uv ( @xmath37 ) and the ir ( @xmath40 ) fixed points the @xmath0-function ( @xmath85 ) gives the correct central charges . ) that as @xmath37 , @xmath39 and as @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "it follows from a simple argument of @xcite that @xmath17 as @xmath39 and @xmath19 as @xmath42 .",
    "so as @xmath32 runs from @xmath43 to @xmath44 , the null generator of the causal horizon runs from the uv to the ir .",
    "] near the uv and the ir fixed points the causal horizon ( [ dcausal ] ) again becomes * killing * ( stationary ) because scaling is recovered .",
    "so to evaluate the central charge at the uv and the ir fixed points we can use the wald entropy formula , i.e ,    a ( - ) = -2l_ads^d-1 ( ) ^d-1 s()|_- = -2l_ads^d-1  s_wald |_uv - ads and a ( ) = -2l_ads^d-1 ( ) ^d-1 s()| _ = -2l_ads^d-1 ( ) ^d-1  s_wald |_ir - ads    where , s_wald = _ ab_cd and we have used the fact that @xmath45 as @xmath37 and @xmath46 as @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath86 has to be evaluated on the uv - ads and the ir - ads .",
    "this was evaluated in @xcite for a general bulk gravity theory described by the action ( [ hac ] ) .",
    "their result is ,     the ads radius and everything is evaluated on pure ads . using this and the fact that @xmath87 , we get ,    s_wald |_ads = _ ab_cd |_ads =   |_ads    therefore , a ( - ) = -2l_ads^d-1  s_wald |_uv - ads = -2  |_uv - ads    and    a ( ) = -2l_ads^d-1 ( ) ^d-1  s_wald |_ir - ads = -2",
    "|_ir - ads    due to maximal symmetry of pure ads the lagrangian density @xmath88 evaluated on pure ads is just a constant number .",
    "now for even @xmath89 the coefficient of the euler density in the trace - anomaly is given by @xcite ,    a^(d ) = -  |_ads    so we can see that in even @xmath89 ,    a ( - ) = 2  a^(d)_uv    and    a ( ) = 2  a^(d)_ir    so these two equations together with the monotonicity condition ( @xmath84 ) @xmath83 following from the second law , proves the holographic @xmath0-theorem for even @xmath89 .",
    "for odd @xmath89 there is no trace - anomaly .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , for odd @xmath89 , the number @xmath90 can be interpreted in terms of the entanglement entropy of the dual conformal field theory .",
    "we refer to these references for further details .",
    "the calculations in @xcite and in the previous sections show that whenever the second law of causal horizon thermodynamics holds in a theory of gravity coupled to matter in @xmath1 , the entropy density evaluated on the deformed ( non - killing ) causal horizon ( @xmath91 ) is a holographic @xmath0-function .",
    "this is consistent with the proposal of @xcite which says that the boundary rg flow is dual to the thermodynamics of causal horizons , i.e , the validity of the second law is both a * necessary * and a * sufficient * condition for holographic @xmath0-theorem to hold .",
    "we have proved the sufficiency condition in the last section for a general theory of gravity in the bulk .",
    "this raises an interesting puzzle .",
    "if the dual of the boundary @xmath0-theorem is the second law of thermodynamics satisfied by causal horizons in @xmath1 , then what happens to bulk theories which violate the second law ?",
    "if the bulk theory is @xmath92 then this is not a problem , because the dual boundary theory is also non - unitary and @xmath0-theorem does not necessarily hold .",
    "but if the bulk theory is unitary then the dual field theory is unitary and @xmath0-theorem must hold .",
    "so :    _ if the duality between @xmath0-theorem and the second law @xcite is correct , then this implies that every * unitary * bulk theory of gravity coupled to matter , * including those with higher - derivative couplings * , satisfies the * second law of causal horizon thermodynamics * in @xmath1 .",
    "if this is not true then @xmath0-theorem will be violated in a unitary lorentz invariant field theory_.    in any case , we hope to have convinced the reader that there is a deep connection between second law of causal horizon thermodynamics and unitarity and lorentz invariance of the holographic dual field theory .",
    "this needs to be fleshed out .",
    "moreover our proof of the sufficiency condition in ( [ suffi ] ) shows that for a unitary bulk theory the _ density _ of the dynamical entropy as defined in ( [ dwald ] ) must be positive , i.e , @xmath93 .",
    "if this condition is violated at any point of the dynamical causal horizon then the holographic @xmath0-function as defined in ( [ a ] ) will be negative .",
    "this negativity is a signature of non - unitarity .",
    "the monotonicity of the @xmath0-function also requires the positivity of the entropy production at every point of the causal horizon .",
    "this is usually satisfied in all known cases but this could be a non - trivial constraint on a general theory of gravity in the bulk . hence _ * unitarity * and lorentz invariance of the holographic dual field theory requires a positive entropy density which is non - decreasing at every point of the dynamical causal horizon_.    non - unitary theories can also satisfy the second law , but it is not a necessary consequence of the duality between @xmath0-theorem and the second law .",
    "let us now say a few words about the implication of this for higher - derivative theories of gravity in @xmath1 .",
    "= space of all theories in ads ; @xmath94 = space of all theories which obey the second law of causal horizon thermodynamics in ads ; @xmath95 = space of all * unitary * theories in ads .",
    ", width=491 ]    in higher derivative theories the entropy of a ( bifurcate killing horizon ) stationary black holes is given by the wald entropy @xcite which by construction satisfies the first law of thermodynamics .",
    "the story of the second law is different . it is known that the wald entropy does not in general satisfy the second law .",
    "there are some cases @xcite where an entropy function exists which satisfies the second law and reduces to the wald entropy in the stationary situation , but no general expression exists .",
    "in fact it is an open question if every higher derivative theory of gravity satisfies the second law or not .",
    "we have argued that for causal horizons in @xmath1 the second law must be satisfied by every _",
    "unitary _ higher - derivative theory of gravity as a consequence of the duality between @xmath0-theorem and the second law .",
    "this is an indirect holographic argument and uses unitarity crucially .",
    "figure-3 summarizes our claim .",
    "an interesting question is whether @xmath96 or @xmath97 is a proper subset of @xmath98 .",
    "that is whether every classical gravity theory satisfies the second law of causal horizon thermodynamics or not ? by every classical gravity theory we mean every covariant unitary or non - unitary gravity plus matter theory in ads described by an action of the form ( [ hac ] ) .",
    "we do not know if this is true or not , but our results show that if this is true , then :    _ every unitary or non - unitary field theory with a classical gravity dual satisfies the @xmath0-theorem . in other words , in the large - n but finite @xmath47 limit , @xmath0-theorem becomes insensitive to the unitarity property of field theory_. here @xmath47 is the t hooft coupling of the dual field theory .",
    "before we conclude we would like to discuss some possible extension of our work .",
    "one such thing is to study the @xmath0-function in a thermal state which is dual to a black hole geometry @xcite .",
    "another potential application is to the study rg flows in the attractor geometry @xcite .",
    "another important problem is to understand the proper field theory interpretation of the results of @xcite and those presented in this paper . in short ,",
    "our results show that at least in the large-@xmath99 limit rg flow and @xmath0-theorem has an emergent thermodynamics interpretation where the @xmath0-function plays the role of the entropy density .",
    "in fact the @xmath0-function at the fixed point has a similar interpretation found in @xcite .",
    "our results show that such an interpretation must exist even away from the fixed point .",
    "it will also be interesting to see how boundary rg flow @xcite fits into this framework .",
    "we hope to return to them in near future .",
