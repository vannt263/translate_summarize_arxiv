    "vector meson behaviour at nonzero temperature is particularly important for systems created in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "details of their creation , propagation and decay greatly affect the overall many - body dynamics of the collisions and consequently the observed particle spectra .",
    "pion or kaon correlations , strangeness production and absolute normalization of dilepton spectra are just a few features deeply linked to the way in which vector mesons behave in hot , strongly interacting matter",
    ". primary emphases in past studies on this topic have been on possible mass shifts , modified dispersion relations and modifications to the widths@xcite .",
    "results for isoscalars and certain neutral isovectors have direct experimental significance since at minimum they might be observed through their decays into lepton pairs .",
    "the @xmath5 meson decays strongly into oppositely charged pion pairs with a lifetime in the vacuum of @xmath3 1.3 fm/@xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath0 decays less often with a vacuum lifetime @xmath3 23 fm/@xmath6 and mostly into the pion triplet @xmath7 owing to its negative g - parity .",
    "some difficulties would surely arise distinguishing one from the other in dilepton channels since they are nearly degenerate in mass  unless some spectacular differences in medium arose .",
    "the @xmath1 , on the other hand , is well removed with a vacuum mass above 1 gev .",
    "it decays primarily into kaon pairs and @xmath8 combinations with average lifetime @xmath3 44 fm/@xmath6 in the vacuum . at temperatures of the pion mass or above , broadening to a `` full '' width",
    "occurs in each of these mesons due to scattering since densities are nearly 1 hadron/@xmath9 .",
    "even rather nonreactive hadrons like the @xmath1 meson will scatter .",
    "are the mean free paths for these particles about 1 fm or perhaps something much greater ? should any of them be expected to pass completely through reaction zones without interacting at all ?",
    "the transverse size of the zone varies as @xmath10 1.2 fm @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the projectile mass number . for the heaviest beams expected in future experiments @xmath14 is about 10 fm .",
    "different outcomes could be expected depending on whether the average collision distances for the vector mesons are larger , nearly the same , or smaller than @xmath14 .    in heavy - ion collisions at high energies",
    "the nuclei pass completely through each other and there is for a short time left behind a highly excited , very hot system of matter .",
    "here is where one might expect to have quarks and gluons ( partons ) relatively free from nonperturbative effects .",
    "the partons are able to traverse distances larger than typical hadron sizes and one speaks of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "tremendous progress has been made recently in understanding some of the possible details of the qgp .",
    "a few specifics include thermalization time scales@xcite , chemical equilibration@xcite , particle production@xcite , temperature scenarios@xcite , and the role of minijets@xcite .",
    "the system will eventually crossover from the plasma phase into a purely interacting hadronic state .",
    "popular guesses as to where this occurs in temperature are near @xmath15 mev . then for several fm/@xmath6 the system will interact strongly , cooling and expanding as it goes .",
    "time and distance scales of interaction for the lightest hadrons are 1 to perhaps a few fm@xcite .",
    "it cools and the pressure drops , expansion takes over and collisions cease to occur sometime about 30 or more fm/@xmath6 later , depending on such details as the roles of expansion and nucleation and subsequent degree of supercooling . at this point the constituent hadrons ( mostly pions ) free stream .",
    "understanding of the high temperature domain for the hadron phase has also improved through recent studies .",
    "finite temperature behaviour of pions , @xmath2 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath16 mesons has been considered@xcite .",
    "temperature s effect has been investigated using finite - temperature field theory at the one - loop level for these mesons .",
    "but one of the basic sources of possible modification from vacuum properties occurs at the two - loop level and has been largely ignored  that of pure collisional modification . with regard to the @xmath1 meson ko and seibert@xcite recently reported finding the full width including scattering was less than 10 mev for all temperatures .",
    "but they neglected some important contributions which are included here and furthermore , their results were somewhat sensitive to the `` in - medium '' width of propagating kaons which was fixed first at 20 mev and then 30 mev for comparison .",
    "improvements to this aspect of the calculation are made here by introducing a temperature and energy dependence to the widths of the exchanged particles .",
    "this paper contains results of collisional effects on @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons and is organized as follows . in the next section a model for the interacting hadronic system",
    "is discussed and its constituent degrees of freedom enumerated .",
    "interactions are modeled with standard , yet simple lagrangians consistent with a more elaborate and complete effective chiral lagrangian .",
    "coupling constants are chosen to give consistency with observed decays .",
    "strong - interaction form factors are presented and briefly discussed .",
    "for some kinematic configurations in scattering the exchanged particles in @xmath17-channel graphs can become timelike and even approach mass shell .",
    "pions and kaons are affected in this study and consequently acquire imaginary parts in their propagators which are estimated by computing temperature and momentum dependent collision rates . for simplicity ,",
    "breit - wigner cross sections are used to account for interaction with pions , kaons and @xmath2 mesons in these estimates .",
    "section  [ sec : rates ] contains the kinetic theoretic results for time and distance scales of interaction .",
    "collision rates for all three vector mesons are computed first and then approximate mean free paths are obtained .",
    "results are shown as a function of temperature in the range @xmath18 mev . a short discussion and summary follows in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] highlighting possible consequences for @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath1-related observables .",
    "one might model the hadronic cooling stage as a thermal ensemble of low - lying hadrons : pions , kaons , @xmath2 and @xmath19(892 ) mesons as well as some heavier axial - vectors @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath1 meson resides here also and like the others will be assumed to be thermalized .",
    "a posteriori this should be checked against average collision distances for validity .",
    "these particles are quantified as fields which interact according to the following lagrangians@xcite @xmath23 where the field strength tensors are @xmath24 and similarly for @xmath25 . in the above expressions",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 refer to axial - vector , pseudoscalar and vector meson fields .",
    "elementary processes can now be considered .",
    "to be completely general at this stage , consider the two diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] , where the species @xmath27 will be a @xmath2 , @xmath0 or a @xmath1 and the set @xmath28 are as - of - yet unspecified . since hadronic cross sections tend to be dominated by resonances , one naturally looks to @xmath29 scattering through @xmath20 , @xmath30 scattering through @xmath22 , @xmath31 scattering through @xmath21 and to strange - particle possibilities for the @xmath1 .",
    "although it can form @xmath32 and @xmath33 when scattering with kaons and @xmath34s , the branching ratios are very small leaving them inconsequential .",
    "there are also resonance possibilities in the non - strange sector . scattering with pions is probable while forming @xmath21 or even @xmath35 mesons .",
    "the branching ratios are not firmly established , but tentative upper limits of 1.5 and 1 percent have been quoted@xcite .",
    "then in the @xmath17 channel there are several seemingly equally important possible configurations since all three vector mesons can scatter with pions , kaons and a host of others . in considering diagrams for the general reaction with any of the vector mesons two problematic components immediately",
    "arise , namely , propagators and form factors .",
    "phase space allows the squared four - momentum of the exchanged particle to access timelike values and even become equal to its mass squared for those processes in which @xmath36 . if @xmath17 is identically equal to @xmath37 then one has a true on - shell decay instead of scattering .",
    "this must be interpreted carefully so as to avoid double counting .",
    "the finite - temperature propagator at tree - level for the exchanged particles should , in principle , have the regular term @xmath38 plus a term which goes like @xmath39@xcite . if the second term is ignored while at the same time an imaginary part is introduced into the denominator of the first one by hand in order to account for the effect of the matter , i.e. @xmath40 , the result consistently accounts for scattering although somewhat phenomenologically .",
    "this is not meant to be a substitute for an evaluation of the two - loop diagrams which would consistently account for scattering plus higher - order corrections to decays at finite temperature , but instead an estimate of it .",
    "the appeal of the kinetic theory approach is that it is very straightforward and yet roughly captures the effect of the hot matter .",
    "hadrons necessitate the use of form factors since they are composite objects and have finite extent which can be seen when probed with higher and higher momentum transfers . a suppression of this region is physically imperative .",
    "the standard way to accomplish this is to insert a monopole form factor @xmath41 at each vertex in a @xmath17-channel diagram where @xmath42 indicates a species for the exchanged particle . besides",
    "the @xmath2-@xmath43-@xmath43 vertices in the reaction @xmath44 which requires special attention to be discussed in a moment , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ffactor ] ) is adopted and a value of @xmath45 = 1.8 gev is taken for all vertices .",
    "some uncertainty is duly noted since this parameter should really be species - dependent but in the absence of data with which one might compare this prescription is at least a reasonable approximation of the common finite - size features .",
    "the monopole form is normalized so that when the intermediate particle is on shell the form factor goes to 1 . for most processes in meson - meson scattering",
    "this normalization is respected and @xmath46 regions are kinematically inaccessible .",
    "however , the intermediate pion in the @xmath17 channel of the reaction @xmath47 is able to access this `` hyper - normalized '' region . to generalize the monopole form factor in a manner which is properly normalized when applied to the present case it is taken to be @xmath48 where the maximum momentum transfer is @xmath49 the kinematical `` triangle function '' is @xmath50 = @xmath51@xcite and a value @xmath52",
    "is taken to soften the vertices .",
    "coupling constants naturally appear in the scattering amplitudes .",
    "they are adjusted in order to obtain the observed partial decay rates .",
    "relevant rates for general decays are computed starting from the interactions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lagrangians ] ) to be @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the center - of - mass momentum of the decay products . from here",
    "one can get all the necessary coupling constants .",
    "they are listed in table  [ table : one ] .",
    "notice that as they are used in the lagrangians of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lagrangians ] ) , some are dimensionless and some carry units of inverse mass .",
    "as mentioned already , timelike and intermediately propagating pions or kaons acquire imaginary parts due to the presence of the matter which are approximated by computing the dominant scattering rates .",
    "for instance , pions will scatter with other pions  a process dominated by the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "they will also scatter with kaons to form @xmath55 resonances .",
    "the rate at which each of these happens is roughly the density times the cross section times the relative velocity .",
    "more precisely , the contribution to the collision rate of particle @xmath56 from pions is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the bose - einstein distribution function and @xmath59 a breit - wigner form for the cross section @xmath60 is used with @xmath61 being the center - of - mass momentum , `` res '' refers to the resonance through which it proceeds and @xmath56 refers generally to pions or kaons . in the case of kaons , resonances @xmath34 and @xmath22 are allowed since scattering with pions and with @xmath2 mesons are frequent .",
    "the width is a function of the three - momentum separately and is therefore frame - dependent but determined by the hadron gas .",
    "results for pions and kaons are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : piandkawidth]@xmath62 and @xmath56 respectively , each for temperatures 100 , 150 and 200 mev . depending on the temperature and on the pion or kaon momenta",
    ", widths vary from 20 to 200 mev .",
    "results similar to these were recently obtained for the momentum dependent scattering rate of @xmath0 mesons at finite temperature using this prescription@xcite .",
    "these broad widths could drastically modify the propagators and consequently modify the vector - meson reactions .",
    "propagators for intermediate pions and kaons , indicated generally by species @xmath56 , will henceforth be @xmath63",
    "the hot matter created in heavy - ion collisions of the type considered here is populated mostly by pions and kaons and one knows their collision times are @xmath64 fm/@xmath6 at high temperatures@xcite .",
    "the system is temporarily supported by its own collisions .",
    "thermodynamic estimates of pion and kaon abundances are 0.3 and 0.1 per @xmath9 for high temperatures while they are 0.15 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 per @xmath9 for @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons at @xmath67 mev .",
    "it is interesting to see just how often they will collide in this model for the reaction zone in the moments before freezeout .      for a general ( bosonic ) reaction involving the vector @xmath27 and having the form @xmath68 , the kinetic theory expression for an average scattering rate is @xmath69 where @xmath70 and similarly for the others , where the bar over the squared scattering amplitude indicates that an initial spin average and final spin sum must been done , where @xmath58 is again the bose - einstein distribution , the @xmath71s are degeneracy factors , and the number density of @xmath27s is @xmath72 reduction of phase space is accomplished with the aid of the four - momentum conserving delta function and the remaining integration is done numerically .",
    "processes considered in this study are enumerated in table  [ table : two ] in no particular order and their scattering amplitudes are relegated to the appendix .",

    "there are ten feynman graphs in total .",
    "elastic scattering with kaons may proceed through both @xmath76 and @xmath17 channels ( two feynman graphs ) with @xmath22 as the exchanged particle . though interference effects are found to be quite modest",
    "the first ten graphs must be added coherently upon squaring , i.e. @xmath79 . the result is then added to the coherent sum of the two kaon graphs @xmath80 .",
    "in addition to these 12 graphs there is some possibility of @xmath2+@xmath2 scattering .",
    "it has been estimated to be relatively unimportant , e.g. something like 5 mev at 200 mev temperature so it will not be discussed further . at the highest temperature",
    "considered the scattering rate from the kaon contribution is 66 mev while the sum of pion and kaon contributions is 115.5 mev .",
    "results are shown separately and then summed in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhocoll ] .",
    "as expected , the pions account for most of the scattering throughout the entire temperature domain but at higher temperatures the kaon contribution becomes nearly 50% of the pions. at highest temperature the collision rate is something like 75% of the vacuum decay rate .",
    "0.75    @xmath81 @xmath82 * meson *    0.75    the dominant contribution for @xmath0 scattering is from pions as well , this time intermediate @xmath2 and @xmath21 mesons are important .",
    "four graphs are needed to account for both @xmath76 and @xmath17 channels and must be added coherently upon squaring @xmath83 .",
    "strange - particle processes involving the @xmath0 are suppressed as compared with the @xmath2 since there is no resonance playing a role as prominent as @xmath84 .",
    "but in their place a sizable contribution comes from @xmath85 .",
    "two diagrams must be computed whose scattering amplitudes are listed along with all the others in the appendix .",
    "resulting contributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : omecoll ] .",
    "a fairly large rate is obtained at high temperature .",
    "the unstable @xmath0 , whose vacuum width is about 8 mev , will have an `` effective width '' of 103 mev assuming its decays are not drastically altered .",
    "recent suggestions were made that a signature of dense hadronic matter might be enhanced @xmath86 production with invariant mass very near @xmath87 due to three pion initial states @xmath7 and owing to the high densities@xcite .",
    "a broadening to the @xmath0 of such an extent as 95 mev might significantly affect the possible signature .",
    "0.75    @xmath88 @xmath89 * meson *    0.75    no single channel dominates the @xmath1 like the other vector mesons considered here since there is no strong @xmath90 resonance where @xmath91 might be a pion , kaon , @xmath34 , or others .",

    "( [ eq : gammaofe ] ) .",
    "clearly these energy dependences are quite important , especially for the highest temperatures .",
    "this channel is not an obvious candidate for a large contribution to the rate yet turns out to be important .",
    "as expected from simple number - density arguments , a large contribution comes from the reaction @xmath94 .",
    "others are important as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : collcompare ] which compares contributions from a subset of the processes listed in table  [ table : two ] .",
    "the overall normalization of the @xmath92 reaction is somewhat of a surprise .",
    "other small surprises are the strengths of @xmath95 ( long - dashed curve ) , @xmath96 ( lower - dotted curve ) and @xmath97 ( quadruple - dot - dashed curve ) . at high temperatures several channels",
    "contribute nearly equally strongly as can be seen from the column of @xmath4 = 200 mev results shown numerically in table  [ table : two ] .",
    "although quite small , contribution from the @xmath35 channel ( triple - dot - dashed curve ) is also shown in the figure .    then , the sum of all contributions is shown in fig .  [ fig : totalrate ] . at 100 mev temperature",
    "the rate is only 2.4 mev .",
    "modification of the @xmath1 width due to the matter is modest .",
    "but as the temperature rises to 150 mev the scattering rate is 8.6 mev and at @xmath98 200 mev , the rate goes to 27.4 mev .",
    "modification of this extent for a particle whose vacuum decay width is of order 4 mev is quite significant .",
    "the `` rule of thumb '' for hadronic collsion distances in finite temperature media are of order 1 fm . for @xmath2 and",
    "possibly @xmath0 mesons this is reasonable since they react vigorously with pions .",
    "however , standard lore has it that only a small fraction of @xmath1 mesons in these media will decay or interact before leaving . to test this idea for how frequently they interact , their mean free paths must be computed .",
    "they can be approximated by @xmath99 collision rates are already obtained , what remains to compute are average velocities .",
    "they are estimated with @xmath100 to be monotonically increasing functions of temperature .",
    "values for the @xmath1 of @xmath101 = 0.46 , 0.54 and 0.61@xmath102 are obtained at temperatures 100 , 150 and 200 mev , respectively .",
    "this translates into mean free paths for the @xmath1 of 38.2 , 14.9 and 4.4 fm at the corresponding temperatures .",
    "results for @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 and for arbitrary temperatures 100 @xmath103 200 mev are shown in fig  [ fig : mfp ] .",
    "the higher - temperature results for the @xmath1 are not consistent with common lore and are therefore worth restating in more direct terms .",
    "the mean free path @xmath104 is shorter than a typical transverse size for colliding nuclei which means on average , the @xmath1 will indeed scatter before leaving the reaction zone . consequently",
    ", the assumption made earlier about its momentum distribution being thermal is probably not unreasonable .",
    "in this paper results were reported for collision rates of @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons at nonzero temperature .",
    "special attention was given to modification of the zero - temperature scalar - boson propagator due to the presence of matter since it is involved quite crucially in certain reactions .",
    "the real part of this modification was ignored while the imaginary part was computed using a simple expression from kinetic theory and then inserted by hand .    at low temperatures ,",
    "by which 100 mev or so is meant , the collision rates for all three were quite small @xmath3 10 , 6 , and 2 mev for @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "results for each of them rises monotonicaly as the number densities of pions and kaons increase .",
    "as temperatures rise above the pion mass , the number densities of species other than pions and kaons become large enough so that collisions with the @xmath1 are more frequent .",
    "scattering of @xmath1 mesons with @xmath2  and @xmath34 mesons becomes significant around 150 mev temperature while at high temperatures several processes contribute nearly equally resulting in a total rate of 27.2 mev at @xmath67 mev . at this extreme ,",
    "the mean free path of @xmath1 mesons is 4.4 fm !",
    "one could be justified in using thermal distributions for this species@xcite .",
    "these time and distance scales could have noticeable consequences on some observables at least for @xmath0 and @xmath1-related ones . a place to look for modification might be in dilepton invariant mass spectra .",
    "for instance , the @xmath1 peak might appear rather differently and may not be so clearly visible above the tail of @xmath105 annihilations .",
    "this broadening or `` melting '' of the resonances could have an affect on the overall normalization of low - mass @xmath86 production since it depends on a sum over all scattering energies for the hadrons ( pions ) .",
    "the broad widths will change the normalization by roughly @xmath106 . in the cases of @xmath2 and @xmath0 at highest temperature",
    "these factors are 1/3 and 1/150 !",
    "a final remark is perhaps in order about the limitations of this approach to studying collisional phenomena as compared with that of purely field theory . in field theory at finite temperature the vector meson self - energy approximated with one - loop diagrams gives rise to on - shell decays within matter .",
    "this is so because there is a basic connection between the statistical mechanical collision rate @xmath107 and the imaginary part of the field - theoretic finite - temperature self - energy @xmath108@xcite .",
    "the two - loop contribution to @xmath108 acquires an imaginary part at @xmath109 0 due to scattering plus higher - order vertex corrections and phase - space broadening of the final states in the above mentioned decays .",
    "mass modification due to the matter is also present in such calculations since the real parts are included .",
    "kinetic theory calculations , on the other hand , like the one presented here simply can not do all this . computing the self - energy to two - loop order at finite - temperature",
