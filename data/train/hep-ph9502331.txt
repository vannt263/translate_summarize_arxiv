    "with the ever - increasing precision of electroweak measurements , viable theories of physics beyond the standard model have become somewhat scarce . in this paper , we reexamine a candidate theory which promises a rich spectrum of resonances and other strong - interaction phenomena beyond the weak scale : the strongly - coupled standard model ( scsm ) , or abbott - farhi model @xcite .",
    "the scsm is based on an underlying lagrangian identical in form to the standard - model lagrangian . however , the parameters of the gauge - higgs sector are adjusted so that the higgs field does not spontaneously break the su(2)@xmath4 gauge symmetry .",
    "instead the su(2)@xmath4 interactions become confining , and the observed particle spectrum consists of su(2)@xmath4 singlets .",
    "nevertheless , given dynamical assumptions such as unbroken chiral symmetry , the low - energy theory of the scsm looks very much like the spontaneously - broken standard model .",
    "the striking similarity of the confining and spontaneously broken phases of the theory exemplifies the concept of `` complementarity . ''",
    "the exciting possibility that nature might in fact be described by a confining version of the standard model , which predicts the discovery of new particles and strong interactions at future colliders , motivates the study of the scsm .    of course , if the scsm really is the theory of the weak interactions , evidence for particle compositeness must eventually emerge .",
    "the effective theory of the scsm must deviate from the renormalizable standard - model lagrangian : resonances and higher - dimensional interactions should appear . in this work",
    "we ask : are the deviations expected in the scsm allowed by current experimental constraints ? we will attempt to answer this question by studying a test case in which we introduce an isotriplet of @xmath0 vector bosons into the effective theory .",
    "we calculate the corrections to standard - model predictions which result from including the @xmath0 bosons .",
    "then we use high - precision electroweak data to constrain these corrections , and thereby bound the allowed region of the @xmath0 mass and couplings .    in an earlier analysis of experimental constraints on the scsm , korpa and ryzak",
    "@xcite  added both an @xmath0 isotriplet and an isoscalar vector boson to the usual standard - model particle content .",
    "they concluded that experiment could accommodate these new particles without severely restricting their masses and couplings . since then many new electroweak observables have been measured , and the accuracy of earlier measurements has greatly increased . here",
    "we exploit this new data to find much stronger constraints on the model . in particular",
    ", the precise measurement of the @xmath5 mass permits a new approach to parameterizing the corrections to standard - model predictions in the scsm .    in the original formulation of the model @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath5 were not expected to have the masses predicted by the standard model ; however , it was known that the standard - model values could be recovered by invoking vector dominance @xcite .",
    "specifically , they follow from the assumption that the @xmath6-pole graph saturates the isovector electromagnetic form factor of the composite fermions . when the @xmath6 and @xmath5 were later discovered with masses near the standard - model values , it became necessary to add to the scsm the assumption that vector dominance holds at least approximately @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we find that the @xmath6 must saturate this form factor to within a few percent .",
    "we consider this unnatural and conclude that , in its present form , the scsm is no longer a candidate for a theory of the electroweak interactions .    in the next section we review the effective theory for the scsm in a limit where non - standard particle content and higher - dimensional interactions are absent , and show that it reduces to the standard model in this limit . in section",
    "3 we introduce a @xmath0 isotriplet and discuss the resulting modification of vector - dominance relations . in section  4",
    "we calculate the @xmath0-induced corrections to electroweak observables , which we summarize in terms of contributions to @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath7 in section  5 .",
    "we then use high - precision electroweak measurements in section  6 to determine the allowed region of the @xmath0 mass and couplings , and present our conclusions in the final section .",
    "the fundamental insight which underlies the scsm is that the particle spectrum and interactions in the strong - coupling version of the standard model could closely resemble those of the familiar spontaneously - broken standard model .",
    "this is an example of complementarity : there is no phase transition between confinement and spontaneous symmetry breaking in a gauge - higgs theory with a higgs in the fundamental representation @xcite . in this section",
    "we review how the effective theory of the scsm approximates the ordinary standard model ( given certain dynamical assumptions ) .",
    "we closely follow the presentation and notation of claudson , farhi and jaffe @xcite . in the next section",
    "we will begin our discussion of the deviations from standard - model predictions which appear when a @xmath0 isotriplet is added .",
    "the scsm is based on an underlying lagrangian which has the same form as the standard - model lagrangian . however , the parameters of the theory are adjusted so that the su(2)@xmath4 interactions are not spontaneously broken , and instead become confining at low energies .",
    "all the observed particles are then su(2)@xmath4 singlets .",
    "consider the potential for the fundamental scalar field , @xmath8 where @xmath9 note that @xmath10 by expressing the potential in terms of @xmath11 , we make explicit the invariance of the potential under the custodial su(2)@xmath12 symmetry , defined by @xmath13 for @xmath14su(2)@xmath12 .",
    "this symmetry is an invariance of the full lagrangian when the hypercharge and yukawa couplings of the fermions are turned off .",
    "the scale dependence of the su(2)@xmath4 gauge coupling is characterized by a scale parameter @xmath15 , analogous to @xmath16 .",
    "this scale parameter and the constant @xmath17 which appears in the scalar - field potential in eq .",
    "( [ omegapot ] ) , together control whether the su(2)@xmath4 interactions are confining or spontaneously broken .",
    "the su(2)@xmath4 gauge symmetry will not be spontaneously broken if @xmath18 or if @xmath19 , in which case the gauge interactions get strong at energies well above @xmath20 and prevent spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the fundamental fields which carry su(2)@xmath4 charge will then be confined into su(2)@xmath4 singlets .",
    "these can be classified using the custodial symmetry , su(2)@xmath12 .",
    "for example , the elementary left - handed fermions @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 labels the su(2)@xmath4 doublet ) bind with the scalar particles @xmath23 to form composite left - handed fermions , @xmath24 which transform as su(2)@xmath12 doublets .",
    "here @xmath25 and @xmath26 are su(2)@xmath4 indices , which are contracted so that the @xmath27 are su(2)@xmath4 singlets .",
    "the hypercharge of a composite fermion is the sum of the elementary fermion and scalar hypercharges , @xmath28 this is simply the electric charge @xmath29 of the fermion , which implies that the hypercharge u(1 ) in the scsm is actually electromagnetism .    from the scalar fields alone we can form a composite higgs field , @xmath30 , which is an su(2)@xmath12 singlet .",
    "we can also form an su(2)@xmath12 triplet of vector bosons , with interpolating field @xmath31 in these examples we can see the crucial role played by the custodial symmetry in organizing the composite particles into multiplets analogous to the familiar su(2)@xmath4 multiplets of the standard model .",
    "( we will later see how this symmetry also ensures that the interactions of the composite particles have the standard form . )    of course , in addition to the particles that are contained in the standard model , experience with the strong interactions leads us to expect in the scsm a rich spectrum of bound states , including excited @xmath0 bosons , leptoquarks and so on .",
    "since these particles have yet to be observed , we must assume that these exotic states are considerably more massive than the left - handed fermions and the @xmath6 bosons .",
    "claudson , farhi , and jaffe enumerated three dynamical assumptions concerning the confining su(2)@xmath4 sector of the theory , which must hold if the scsm is to describe the observed electroweak phenomena @xcite :    * the approximate su(12 ) chiral symmetry which relates the 12 su(2)@xmath4 fermion doublets is not spontaneously broken by a condensation of left - handed fermions ( i.e. , @xmath32 ) .",
    "this chiral symmetry then protects the composite left - handed fermions @xmath27 from acquiring large masses .",
    "( if this chiral symmetry were broken , there would be light goldstone bosons consisting of two left - handed fermions , and the composite fermions would be heavy , as their analogs are in qcd . ) * the @xmath6 vector bosons are much lighter than the typical mass scale in the theory ( e.g. , @xmath15 ) , and in particular , the @xmath6 and @xmath5 are much lighter than their recurrences , the @xmath0 and @xmath33 . *",
    "the effective coupling of the @xmath6 bosons to left - handed fermions is small ( @xmath34 ) even while the underlying theory is strongly - coupled .    with these assumptions",
    "we can write down the low - energy effective lagrangian for the scsm",
    ". interactions with dimension greater than four should be suppressed by the characteristic mass scale , @xmath35 which by assumption ( ii ) is much larger than @xmath36 as long as we work at energies no higher than the @xmath5 mass , we should be able to omit these higher - dimensional operators from the effective theory .",
    "then the most general su(2)@xmath12-symmetric effective lagrangian involving the composite fermion and vector - boson fields is @xmath37 where the @xmath6 self - couplings have not been listed . here",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 electromagnetism , which breaks the custodial symmetry , can then be added by minimal substitution of the vector potential , @xmath40 and insertion of the field - strength , @xmath41 : @xmath42 again cubic and quartic vector - boson interactions have not been listed . here",
    "@xmath43 is the contribution of the fermions to the electromagnetic current .",
    "if we now assume vector dominance , so that the isovector electromagnetic form factor of the @xmath27 is saturated by the @xmath6 boson , then as will be discussed in the next section , we find that the strength @xmath44 of the photon-@xmath45 mixing mixing .",
    "] is given in terms of the u(1 ) coupling and the @xmath46 coupling as @xmath47 diagonalizing the quadratic terms in the lagrangian ( [ lem ] ) which involve the neutral vector bosons , we find the propagating fields @xmath48 which couple to the neutral currents as @xmath49 hence the value of @xmath50 that would be measured in low - energy neutrino scattering is @xmath51 where we have used the vector - dominance result @xmath47 this implies that @xmath52 which leads to the standard prediction for the mass of the @xmath6 : @xmath53 in the above diagonalization process one additionally finds a @xmath5 mass of @xmath54 applying the vector - dominance result again , we recover the standard - model relation @xmath55 we see therefore how the additional assumption of vector dominance leads to the standard - model predictions for the masses of both the @xmath6 and the @xmath56 a vector - dominance analysis of the electromagnetic form factors of the @xmath6 shows that the cubic and quartic self - couplings of the @xmath6 are those of an su(2 ) gauge theory with coupling @xmath57 and that the corresponding couplings of the propagating fields , @xmath58 and @xmath5 , are just those of the standard model @xcite .",
    "we have just seen that with certain dynamical assumptions , and invoking vector dominance , the effective theory of the scsm approximates the standard model .",
    "we now begin our analysis of the corrections to the effective theory that result when we introduce an isotriplet of @xmath0 vector bosons .",
    "a @xmath0 should arise in this model as a radial excitation of the @xmath6 , analogous to the @xmath59 in qcd . because there is no evidence yet for deviations from the standard model",
    ", the @xmath0 must be considerably more massive than the @xmath6 and/or less strongly coupled .",
    "we will therefore treat the inclusion of the @xmath0 as a perturbation of the standard model .    of course",
    ", we could include other non - standard particles in the theory .",
    "alternatively , we could include in the lagrangian all operators up to some dimension which are consistent with the symmetries of the theory .",
    "however , as we will soon show , the @xmath0 is the degree of freedom which corresponds to relaxing the assumption that the @xmath6 saturates the isovector electromagnetic form factor . adding a @xmath0",
    "thus allows us to consider corrections to the effective theory due to new particle content , and also to study deviations from exact vector dominance . at the same time , including a @xmath0 isotriplet adds only three new parameters to the low - energy effective theory , and therefore it is possible to significantly constrain the theory .",
    "the lagrangian terms for the @xmath0 are similar in form to those for the @xmath60 eqs .",
    "( [ lzero ] ) and ( [ lem ] ) : @xmath61 in constructing @xmath62 we have proceeded much as before in arriving at eqs .",
    "( [ lzero ] ) and ( [ lem ] ) .",
    "we have first constructed the most general @xmath63-symmetric lagrangian .",
    "next we have diagonalized the lagrangian to eliminate terms which mix the @xmath6 and @xmath0 bosons .",
    "finally we have included electromagnetism , which leads to mixing of the photon with @xmath45 and @xmath64 for later purposes , we note that by substituting @xmath65 we can reverse the signs of both @xmath66 and @xmath67 showing that only the relative sign of these two couplings is meaningful .",
    "we now show how the @xmath0 parameterizes the deviation from vector - meson dominance : consider the isovector electromagnetic form factor of the composite fermions , @xmath68 , defined through @xmath69 here @xmath70 is the total electromagnetic current , which includes terms linear in @xmath45 and @xmath71 the sum of the contributions to the form factor ( see fig .",
    "1 ) from direct coupling of the current to the left - handed fermions and from the @xmath45- and @xmath72-pole diagrams is @xmath73 because the @xmath74 are composite and the confining su(2)@xmath4 interactions are asymptotically free , @xmath75 as @xmath76 .",
    "then , assuming that @xmath68 is saturated by the @xmath45 and @xmath72 poles ( i.e. , there are no other contributions to the form factor , such as from a @xmath77 ) , we conclude that @xmath78 where we have introduced the ratios of @xmath6 and @xmath0 couplings @xmath79 had we assumed strict vector dominance so that only the @xmath6-pole diagram contributed , we would have found the result @xmath80 , which leads to the standard - model lagrangian as was shown in section  2 . by including the @xmath81 however , we depart from exact vector dominance .",
    "the @xmath0 contributes a fraction @xmath82 to the saturation of @xmath68 , so that @xmath83 measures the degree of the departure .    for the model to approximately reproduce the standard model",
    ", the @xmath6 must nearly saturate this form factor .",
    "here we have further assumed that the @xmath0 contribution to the saturation , though of necessity much smaller than that of the @xmath6 , is nevertheless more important than contributions from higher - lying resonances , which have been ignored .",
    "in essence , we are claiming that the @xmath0 can be viewed as a stand - in for all the resonances beyond the @xmath6 which contribute to @xmath68 .",
    "the quantity @xmath83 accordingly represents the combined contribution of these resonances to the saturation of this form factor .",
    "the mixing of the photon with the neutral @xmath45 and @xmath72 bosons introduces off - diagonal terms into the free ( quadratic ) part of the lagrangian .",
    "we need to diagonalize the free lagrangian to find the physical photon , @xmath5 and @xmath33 fields . in the previous section we gave expressions for the physical photon and @xmath5 fields that diagonalize the free part of lagrangian in the absence of the @xmath0 bosons .",
    "these expressions , and also the result for the @xmath5 mass , are modified by the mixing of the photon with @xmath64 for the masses of the @xmath5 and @xmath33 we find @xmath84\\ , \\nonumber\\\\ { m_{z'}}^2&\\approx&{m_{w'}}^2\\left [     { 1+{s^4\\over c^4}\\mu\\kappa^2 \\over 1-{s^2\\over c^2}\\kappa^2 }     + { s^4\\over c^2(c^2-\\mu)}\\mu\\kappa^2 \\right]\\ . \\label{mzsqr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 is the ratio of the @xmath6 and @xmath0 squared masses : @xmath88 terms containing extra factors of @xmath89 have been omitted .",

    "these results for the @xmath5 and @xmath33 masses ( [ mzsqr ] ) and the expressions for @xmath45 and @xmath72 in terms of @xmath5 and @xmath33 ( [ neutralphys ] ) were calculated by expanding in powers @xmath95 which is assumed to be small .",
    "this assumption reflects our intuition that the @xmath0 should be heavier than the @xmath6 ( @xmath96 and should also mix more weakly with the photon ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "note that all of the above corrections to standard - model relations  the vector dominance result for the electromagnetic coupling ( [ vectdom ] ) and the mass and couplings of the @xmath6 and @xmath98 ( [ mzsqr ] ) and ( [ neutralphys ] )  contain factors of at least two of the @xmath0 parameters @xmath90 , @xmath99 and @xmath87 .",
    "the same is true of corrections to four - fermi interactions mediated by @xmath0 exchange , which are of order @xmath100 .",
    "hence if any two of the @xmath0 parameters vanish , the effective low - energy theory reduces to that of the standard model , leaving the remaining @xmath0 parameter completely unconstrained .",
    "this means that we will be unable to obtain constraints on any individual parameter independent of the other parameters .",
    "we will either have to fix one of the parameters and then constrain the other two , or else constrain products of the parameters , e.g. , the product @xmath83 .    as mentioned above , korpa and ryzak in their earlier analysis of scsm constraints",
    "considered the scsm with not only an isotriplet of @xmath0 vector bosons but also with isoscalar vector bosons which are bound states of a left - handed fermion and a left - handed antifermion : @xmath101 assuming that those @xmath102 bosons which are color octets , and thus mix with gluons , saturate the ( isoscalar ) color form factor of the composite , left - handed quarks , they were able to place a very stringent bound on the mass of the isoscalar bosons ( @xmath103 ) , so that the @xmath102 bosons would be just as massive as the rest of the non - standard resonances .",
    "this called into question the assumption of vector dominance of the isoscalar form factors .",
    "of course , vector dominance of the _ isoscalar _ channel is not a necessary ingredient in the scsm .",
    "by contrast , vector dominance of the _ isovector _ channel must at least approximately hold in order to account for the @xmath6 and @xmath5 masses . by including a @xmath0 we can determine to what accuracy vector dominance",
    "must be maintained in the isovector channel in order to retain agreement with electroweak data .",
    "we have seen that the scsm as formulated here reduces to the standard model if the @xmath0 is absent or if it has infinite mass and vanishing couplings .",
    "and , of course , the standard model is in impressive agreement with experiment .",
    "it is therefore logical to treat the scsm with a @xmath0 as a perturbation of the standard model and calculate the corrections to sm predictions due to the @xmath0 .",
    "the corrections induced by the @xmath0 are not simply given by the sum of the new graphs that include @xmath0s .",

    "their values determine the masses and couplings of the vector bosons .",
    "however , as the @xmath0 parameters are turned on , the @xmath6 parameters must deviate from their standard - model values if @xmath25 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are to remain fixed .",

    "this removes some of the possible sensitivity to @xmath33 bosons .",
    "we see that corrections to the low - energy theory due to the @xmath0 enter through 4 independent functions of the @xmath0 parameters : @xmath156 , @xmath138 , @xmath135 , and @xmath149 .",

    "however , when either @xmath90 or @xmath99 is extremely small , the other can become large , particularly when the @xmath0 is heavy .",
    "this is expected since , as was pointed out in section  3.2 , if any two of @xmath192 @xmath99 and @xmath87 vanish , the remaining quantity is unconstrained .    in figure",
    "3 we show the allowed range of @xmath90 ( @xmath224 ) as a function of @xmath225 for @xmath226 @xmath227 @xmath228 and @xmath229 here we exploit the symmetry noted after eq .",
    "( [ lem ] )  namely invariance under simultaneous change of sign of @xmath99 and @xmath90  in order to restrict attention to positive @xmath230 from this figure we conclude that for reasonable values of @xmath193 @xmath90 must be extremely small ; in other words the @xmath0 must mix much more weakly with the photon than the @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath231 , @xmath232    in figure  4 we show the maximum value of @xmath66 allowed by our constraints ( @xmath224 ) as a function of @xmath233 and we compare our constraints with those obtained in the direct @xmath0 search at cdf @xcite .",
    "note that our bounds are more restrictive than the cdf bounds .",
    "further , the cdf analysis assumes that the @xmath0 decays entirely into left - handed fermions , whereas in the scsm a @xmath0 will primarily decay into @xmath234 for @xmath235 above the decay threshold , @xmath236 . hence the cdf bounds do not help us bound @xmath99 in the scsm .",
    "our constraint analysis indicates that at a moderate value of @xmath235 such as @xmath237 , the @xmath0 coupling to fermions must be less than a quarter of the @xmath6 coupling .",
    "comparing our results with the earlier analysis by korpa and ryzak @xcite , we can see how the continually improving electroweak measurements have drastically pared away the allowed parameter space in this model . in their figure",
    "4 they found @xmath83 allowed to be as large as @xmath238 compared to our upper bound of @xmath239 similarly , for @xmath240 they found that the @xmath0 could be as light as @xmath241gev and @xmath90 could be as large as @xmath242 while for @xmath240 we now find that the @xmath0 must be heavier than @xmath243gev and @xmath90 can be at most @xmath244 moreover , our much more restrictive bounds hold at @xmath205 cl , while the earlier bounds held only at @xmath245 cl .    korpa and ryzak concluded from their analysis that there was plenty of room for the non - standard particle content predicted by the scsm . from our analysis of the scsm exploiting recent electroweak data ,",
    "we conclude that the currently allowed parameter space is so small as to strongly argue against the model .",
    "there is no reason to expect vector dominance to hold at a level of @xmath218 nor can we understand how the @xmath0 could mix with the photon only @xmath246 as much as the @xmath6 mixes ; yet we have found that this would have to be the case even if the coupling of the @xmath0 to the left - handed fermions is allowed to be as small as @xmath247 the @xmath6 coupling ( itself already small for a strongly - coupled theory ) .    it is possible that by including more resonances in our analysis we could find regions in the enlarged parameter space where the various corrections to standard - model predictions cancel , without forcing the masses and couplings of the resonances to be unnaturally small .",
    "but from our analysis it is clear that these cancellations would have to be rather delicate , and the agreement of the scsm with experiment would be just as inexplicable .    of course , we can never completely exclude the scsm solely on the basis of experimental constraints .",
    "the strongly - coupled dynamics underlying the effective theory do not allow us to find predictions for masses and couplings which could be contradicted by experiment .",
    "however , the model offers no natural understanding of how it could continue to evaded detection , disguised as the spontaneously - broken standard model . for this reason ,",
    "we conclude that unless there emerges from a study of the strong dynamics an explanation of how it could be so nearly indistinguishable from the standard model , the strongly - coupled standard model can no longer be viewed as a possible theory of the electroweak interactions .",
