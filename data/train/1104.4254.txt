    "since long , high - resolution magnetic spectrometers for charged particles have been used in nuclear and particle physics . combined with suitable coordinate detectors for tracking",
    ", such instruments can achieve the most accurate measurement of kinematic quantities  @xcite . for focusing spectrometers",
    "the measurements can be done in an detection area out of the line - of - sight to the target that is shielded to some extend from background particles . at the two currently operating high - energy ,",
    "high - intensity continuous electron beam accelerators mami in mainz , germany , and cebaf at jefferson lab ( jlab ) , virginia , wire chambers are routinely operated as tracking detectors in magnetic spectrometers  @xcite .    during the last decade , a class of strangeness production experiments represented by the @xmath0 reaction were realized at the spectrometer facilities of both laboratories .",
    "the small cross - sections encountered in these reactions require high luminosities and in case of hypernuclear reactions the use of nuclear targets up to the medium - mass region ( @xmath1 52 ) .",
    "to maximise hypernuclear yields , the spectrometers are operated at minimum forward angles , where background rates increase by several orders of magnitude , severely interfering with the operation of the wire chambers .    in the pilot @xmath0 hypernuclear experiment at jlab , e89 - 009 , a very high rate of electrons associated with bremsstrahlung dominated the background in the electron spectrometer and a very high rate of positrons from dalitz pairs dominated the particle flux in the kaon spectrometer , so that beam currents were limited to below 1@xmath2a , giving an experimental luminosity , @xmath3 , of approximately 0.001 @xmath4 10@xmath5@xmath6s@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "even after a decade of optimizations the wire chambers of the third generation experiment at jlab , e05 - 115 ( hks - hes ) , experienced multiple tracks for a medium - mass target of 150mg@xmath8@xmath6 and beam currents of several @xmath2a ( @xmath3= 0.09 @xmath4 10@xmath5@xmath6s@xmath7 ) that could not be resolved by the standard tracking analysis with a track reconstruction efficiency higher than @xmath9 50%  @xcite .",
    "the operation of multi - wire proportional chambers ( mwpcs ) in the  spectrometer at mami is discussed in section  [ sec : mwpc ] .",
    "it is described how the centre - of - charge analysis method , well - established in single - track events , had to be adapted to the multiple - track events . the strong variation in the charge distributions and the ambiguity introduced by a large number of charge clusters per event has lead to the development of a cluster and track - finding algorithm for the mwpcs , which is presented in sections  [ sec : clusters ] and [ sec : tracks ] .",
    "this algorithm succeeded in resolving the multiple - track ambiguities with high efficiency .",
    "it was in - beam tested with a set of dedicated efficiency counters which allowed to check the validity of possible tracks .",
    "results of the efficiency measurements are presented in section  [ sec : efficiencies ] and the application of the method is discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "crucial requirements for the wire chamber operation in kaon electroproduction measurements are ( i ) high efficiency for minimum ionizing particles and ( ii ) tracking capability for luminosities above 5 @xmath4 10@xmath5@xmath6s@xmath7 .",
    "the limit for the second requirements depend strongly on the wire chamber geometry .",
    "it is known that slow - moving ions from the avalanches around the anodes form space charges that reduce the field . the effective voltage drop for a given particle rate increases with the anode pitch , with the distance between anode and cathode plane , and with the gas gain  @xcite .",
    "modern developments aim for mwpc that resolve track coordinates with a spatial resolution of about 100@xmath2 m in a very high - rate background up to a few mhz@xmath8@xmath6 .",
    "such chambers have small chamber dimensions and are operated with low gas gain .    at the institut fr kernphysik in mainz , germany ,",
    "two large - sized mwpcs are operated by the a1 collaboration as tracking detectors in the  spectrometer s hadron arm  @xcite .",
    "they were used before in several beam - times at gsi for trajectory reconstruction at relativistic heavy ion experiments , detecting successfully trajectories of pions and kaons as well as protons and heavy nuclear fragments  @xcite .",
    "contrary to conventional mwpcs the multiplication process in these chambers is divided into two steps , following a concept first described by breskin and co - workers  @xcite . during the electron scattering experiments at mami",
    "the distribution of charge states of the ionizing particles as well as particle fluxes differ greatly from the situation at gsi .",
    "typically the detector packages of spectrometers at electron machines are heavily shielded . at mami , the the shielding houses of the three - spectrometer facility consist of 40 cm thick boron carbide loaded concrete walls covered with a 5 cm thick lead layer on the inside .",
    "they weigh about 110 tons each  @xcite . for the shielding of the  spectrometer",
    "polyethylene shields with 15% diboron trioxide by weight were used in combined system of shielding walls and ceiling covering 20m@xmath10 .",
    "the walls comprise a 10 cm thick neutron shield and a 5 cm thick lead layer . at the  spectrometer",
    "the chambers , placed behind the analysing dipole magnet , are shielded by polyethylene walls and ceiling with 15% diboron trioxide by weight covering 20m@xmath10 .",
    "the walls comprise a 10 cm thick neutron shield and a 5 cm thick lead layer . however , when a continuous - wave electron beam of several @xmath2a current is delivered to solid - state or cryogenic liquid targets situated in front of the dipole the chambers experience multiple tracks in almost every event due to high electromagnetic background radiation levels .",
    "the two mwpcs , labelled m and l , have an active area of 1190 @xmath4 340mm@xmath10 each .",
    "the chambers are schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mwpc - schematic ] .",
    "they consist of a plane of anodes (   = 20@xmath2 m gold - plated tungsten wires , 2 mm spacing ) , symmetrically sandwiched between two orthogonal planes of cathodes in @xmath11- and @xmath12- direction (   = 50@xmath2 m gold - plated tungsten wires , 1 mm spacing ) along with two meshes of woven fabrics of plastic coated with a nickel layer , making up two planar electrode structures , the grid ( @xmath13 ) and the transfer ( @xmath14 ) plane and two gaps , the pre - amplification gap and the transfer - gap .",
    "the wires of the anode plane are running in diagonal direction , making an angle of 45@xmath15 with either cathode direction .",
    "typical potentials applied to these electrodes are : @xmath16 @xmath179.1kv , @xmath18 @xmath172.0kv , @xmath19 @xmath204.0kv , with the cathodes grounded .",
    "m gold - plated tungsten wires , 2 mm spacing ) , symmetrically sandwiched between two orthogonal planes of cathodes (   = 50@xmath2 m gold - plated tungsten wires , 1 mm spacing ) along with two conducting grids , providing two gaps in front of the wire planes . on the right side a typical distribution of the electric field is shown .",
    "electrons liberated in the pre - amplification gap are amplified before drifting through the transfer - gap , the transferred charge is amplified a second time at the anodes . ]    despite modern alternatives like micro - pattern gas detectors , the use of multi - wire proportional chambers ( mwpcs ) is still an economical way to cover a large area with tracking devices for charged particles .",
    "mwpcs are especially attractive when the particle track can be recorded from a single chamber in two orthogonal dimensions and when the required resolution is not significantly finer than fwhm @xmath21 1 mm .    to determine the particle track the measured charge distributions induced on the cathode wire planes of the mwpcs are analysed .",
    "of the several known methods for the bi - dimensional read - out of mwpcs , the induced - charge sampling is well established since the 1970s  @xcite .",
    "however , even in single - track operation , the choice of analysis method for the induced charge distributions on the cathode strips or wires has consequences on the position resolution and the track reconstruction efficiency  @xcite .",
    "the method can give good spatial resolution , but is compromised for multiple particles in one event as the signals can get partially integrated , the wide charge distributions can overlap , and peaks can get distorted .",
    "five cathode wires are connected together to one channel and are brought to one charge - sensitive preamplifier making a total of 240 analogue channels in @xmath11- and 70 analogue channels in @xmath12-direction .",
    "the preamplifiers provide a bipolar output with a negative amplitude of up to 2.5v .",
    "the pulse width is @xmath9 2@xmath2s .",
    "the signals are digitized by an adc card addressed by a freely programmable transputer module , mounted directly on the chamber .",
    "the adc converts the signal within 1.34@xmath2s into 8 bit .",
    "sixteen of the adc channels are read out and processed by one transputer .",
    "the transputer network system is connected to a multi - link card inside a front - end computer . as the fwhm of an induced cathode signal",
    "is known to be nearly equal to twice the anode - to - cathode gap , this is 2 @xmath4 9 mm , clusters of signals in 35 channels are observed .",
    "particles from the target cross the mwpc planes with an angle of about ( 50 @xmath22 20)@xmath15 to the normal .",
    "the peak position of charges transferred from the pre - amplification gap to the anodes is assumed to coincide with the impact point of the trajectory of the ionizing particle with the grid plane .",
    "this position does not depend on the angle of incidence of the particle s trajectory , whereas the shape of the charge distribution is influenced .",
    "the chambers are filled with a gas mixture of \\{84% ar , 9% co@xmath23 , 7% c@xmath24h@xmath25 } in volume concentration .",
    "calibrated flow controllers are used to control the amounts of the three gas components .",
    "details of the induced charge distributions depend on experimental parameters like track angles , particle species and velocities , and multiplicities , but also on working conditions like gas mixture , high voltages , and the integration gate width and timing .",
    "therefore it is of practical importance to apply an algorithm which gives the best position resolution and highest track reconstruction efficiency .",
    "however , the choice of the analysis method depends heavily on the experimental requirements .",
    "fluctuations in the primary ionisation and electron diffusion along the drift path lead to non - gaussian charge distributions induced on the cathodes .",
    "the distributions are further deteriorated by noisy channels , by multiple tracks in the chamber , and by induced signals in the electronic chain . to relate",
    "the induced charge distributions to the avalanche position , ( i ) the geometrical parameters of the chamber , ( ii ) the signal - to - noise ratio , and ( iii ) physical processes of the ionization and avalanche formation had to be taken into account .",
    "charge distributions in both mwpcs taken with 2@xmath2a beam current on a 5 cm liquid hydrogen target , corresponding to luminosities of 2.500 @xmath4 10@xmath5@xmath6s@xmath7 , are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : mwpcevent164 ] and [ fig : mwpcevent0 ] .",
    "peak positions as indicated by vertical and horizontal lines in the display were determined by the cluster algorithm discussed in this section .",
    "the raw data are 8-bit adc values , @xmath26 , for each read - out channel , @xmath27 , in the @xmath11- and @xmath12-plane . as preamplifiers and adcs vary along the planes , each combination",
    "is assigned a gain factor @xmath28 and a pedestal value @xmath29 . in few cases , where individual channels showed misbehaviour , caused _",
    "e.g. _  by wire ageing , their amplitudes were interpolated from both neighbouring channels .",
    "then `` clusters '' are defined by a group of neighbouring channels with detected charges .",
    "a cluster has to consist of at least 2 channels and could include a single channel below pedestal . at first each cluster",
    "is characterized by its detected charge , @xmath30 , its channel multiplicity , @xmath31 , its centre - of - charge , @xmath32 , its width , @xmath33 , and its largest amplitude , @xmath34 , at channel @xmath35 .    because of the two amplification regions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mwpc - schematic](right ) , and the large crossing angles of the particles , the liberated charges that are drifting from the pre - amplification plane will be displaced in the anode plane with respect to the weaker direct signal .",
    "the two separated charge localisations differ by a distance @xmath36 , @xmath37 being 35 mm . for a typical angle of @xmath38",
    "this distance was @xmath39 mm corresponding to 10 channels . as the amplification of the direct signal was only partial , and the signal was induced on the cathodes at a much earlier time and thus got integrated only partially , a second peak in the charge distribution was not often observed , however , an asymmetry in the shape of the peak was regularly present in the signals . because the drift time was regulated by the gas mixture and the high voltages , and the integration gate",
    "could get matched to this drift time , it was possible to minimize the appearance of double peaks and to reduce variation in cluster shapes . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mwpcevent164 ] the peaks in the @xmath11-plane of mwpc  m show features related to the two - stage amplification .    during the experiments sometimes charge distributions were observed , where satellite peaks were accompanying the physical peak , that was produced by a heavily - ionising light particle .",
    "[ fig : mwpcevent0 ] shows a charge distribution in the @xmath11-plane of mwpc  m with satellite charges on both sides of a needle - like peak .",
    "the source of these peaks can be understood by the anode plane construction mounted in between the cathode planes and was identified as a capacitive coupling between anode and cathode at the stesalite frame which have a dielectric constant @xmath40 6 , see discussion in  @xcite . a strong correlation exits between the vertical position of the physical peak and the relative position of the satellites in the @xmath11-plane .",
    "typical distances between the satellites are 8286 cathode channels reflecting the height of the frame .",
    "the satellite signals were not be present in single - track events after a fine adjustment of the integration gate , but could not be avoided in multi - track events , when the integration gate was offset in respect to the timing of the second traversing particle , and the integration became sensitive to charges induced on the cathode strips by charges flowing out of the anode wires .    a beam current , corresponding to luminosities of 2.5 @xmath4 10@xmath5@xmath6s@xmath7 .",
    "the anode wires are shown schematically as diagonal lines , cathode wires run horizontally and vertically .",
    "the grey shaded area corresponds to the active region of a chamber .",
    "peak positions are determined by calculating the centre - of - charge from a restricted number of cathode channels and are indicated by vertical and horizontal lines in the display .",
    "the peak - finding algorithm assumes a typical peak fwhm of 35 cathode strips and allows for asymmetric tails inherent to the chamber geometry . ]",
    "such distributions are formed by multiple particles traversing the chamber at different times , so that the integration time window is offset and the integration is sensitive to charges induced on the cathode strips by charges flowing out of the anode wires .",
    "the coupling is seen by comparing the end - points of the diagonal anode wire crossing the vertical line of the needle peak to the position of the satellite peaks .",
    "the peak - finding algorithm rejects those satellites on the basis of their shape . ]",
    "each cluster is further analysis for its internal structure to identify possible peak positions as follows : a truncated cluster is created around the channel with the charge maximum , @xmath35 .",
    "it extends to the left and to the right for 2 channels , if the charge values for these channels are below a minimum of 90% of the charge in @xmath35 .",
    "the truncated cluster extends at most up to the limits of the original cluster or up to a channel with only a minimum of charge . for clusters that reach",
    "the 8-bit maximum of the adc the counting of channels starts at the left and right limits of the saturation plateau .",
    "if no such structure is found the cluster is discarded .",
    "this procedure ensured that a truncated cluster corresponds to a peak - like structure .",
    "next , the summed charge in the truncated cluster is compared to the charge outside the peak region . if the latter is larger than 30% in the @xmath11-planes of the mwpc or larger than 1% in the @xmath12-planes of the mwpc and the outside region is wider than the required minimum for a cluster , a separate cluster is created .",
    "the difference between the @xmath11- and @xmath12-planes is attributed to the different appearances of pick - up charges on the cathode wires .",
    "the extensions of the new cluster is depending on the distribution of charges . for a large charge close to the original peak , _",
    "i.e._within 2 channels , the new cluster extends to the peak region , otherwise to the border region .",
    "this construction avoids the creation of extra clusters when fluctuations appear in the tails of the original peak .",
    "in the analysis of the data all clusters are combined to form possible particle tracks . with @xmath31 clusters @xmath41",
    "possible track points and @xmath42 possible tracks through both chambers are generated .",
    "this ensemble is classified according to a set of track quality factors , ranging from 0 ( excluded ) to 1 ( highest quality ) .",
    "as the mwpcs were constructed with symmetric cathode planes , a correlation exists between the induced charge measured in one cathode plane to the induced charge of the perpendicular plane .",
    "[ fig : chargelxvsly ] shows a large set of measured charges in mwpc  l deposited by particles of different velocities .",
    "a third order polynomial function was used to parametrise phenomenologically the distribution .",
    "the non - linear response is attributed to many factors , the asymmetry in the liberated charges drifting through the two - step mwpc , the systematics in the cluster - finding , and saturation in the adcs . in each mwpc",
    "the measured difference of a pair of clusters in @xmath11- and @xmath12-direction to the phenomenological curve is used to determine the quality factors @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in many cases with these factors alone",

    "valid tracks are bound to angular limits , given by the acceptance of the spectrometer .",
    "both mwpcs are situated in a field - free space , so that particle tracks can be extrapolated linearly to the field boundary at the end of the dipole .",
    "especially the relation between vertical hit positions of the two chambers provides a powerful criterion for the track finding .",
    "the target angle acceptance of the spectrometer is large in the horizontal direction and small in the vertical direction .",
    "the vertical track angles , @xmath45 , for particles originating at the target are strongly correlated to the vertical positions .",

    "a cluster - finding and track reconstruction algorithm was developed that assigns each possible track a quality factor .",
    "this method was in - beam tested with two large - sized mwpcs in the  spectrometer and proved to be effective not only in quantifying the tracking efficiencies , but more importantly it allowed to systematically determine track reconstruction efficiencies which can be applied to the operation of the mwpcs in electro - production experiments .",
    "in general , tracks of heavily ionising particles in a low background environment have the largest probability of being properly reconstructed .",
    "tracks of minimum ionizing particles are harder to reconstruct properly as background signals of dominantly small amplitudes are present in the chambers at any time .",
