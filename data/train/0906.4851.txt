    "the term steering was introduced by schrdinger in 1935  @xcite as a description of the effect predicted by einstein , podolsky and rosen  @xcite , which has become famous as the epr paradox . in the language",
    "now commonly used in quantum information , steering describes the ability of alice ( or bob ) to perform certain measurements on one half of a non - local entangled system and thereby affect the ensemble of possible states that describe bob s ( or alice s ) system .",
    "in a recent work  @xcite , wiseman _ et al . _ showed that violation of the reid criteria  @xcite for existence of the epr paradox is a demonstration of steering for gaussian systems .",
    "et al . _ also raised the very interesting question of whether there could be asymmetric states which could be steerable by one party but not the other . in this paper",
    "we answer this question in the affirmative for mixed states and gaussian measurements  @xcite , showing that this effect can potentially be realised using the intracavity nonlinear coupler  @xcite .",
    "we note here that it remains an open question whether some form of non - gaussian measurement is possible on this system which could demonstrate symmetric steering , and also that this is a difficult question to give a general answer to in the case of mixed states .",
    "the possibility of asymmetric steering or epr arises from an intrinsic asymmetry in the description which is not present in the usual criteria for establishing the inseparability of a bipartite quantum state ( as an example , see the duan - simon criteria  @xcite ) .",
    "steering is explained in wiseman _",
    "_ as a task requiring two parties , once again called alice and bob . beginning with alice , she prepares a bipartite state and sends one half to bob , with the task being to convince bob that the state is entangled .",
    "bob believes in quantum mechanics but does not trust alice ; he wants to see the entanglement proven .",
    "the two make measurements and communicate their results classically .",
    "if the correlations between the two sets of measurements can be explained without invoking quantum mechanics , bob will not be convinced that the state is entangled .",
    "asymmetric steering arises when alice can convince bob that the state is entangled , but after a reversal of the roles , bob can not convince alice of the same thing .",
    "as both alice and bob are both looking at the same overall system , but get different answers , this is an interesting , albeit different , example of the role of the observer in quantum mechanics . rather than the usual example where the role of the observer is to collapse the wavefunction , in this case each observer must decide whether the bipartite system can be described by a local hidden variable theory and they get conflicting answers despite making similar measurements on the part available to them .",
    "the epr criteria developed by reid  @xcite and violated experimentally  @xcite by ou _",
    "_ are the criteria needed for demonstrating steering in a continuous variable system for gaussian measurements . moreover , in a gaussian system such as we will be treating here , the inferred quadrature variances as defined by reid are equivalent to the conditional variances which are optimal for systems which exhibit non - gaussian statistics . that the reid criteria give",
    "the optimal gaussian measurement has also been shown more recently by jones _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who have shown that if the inferred quadrature variances do not violate the appropriate inequality , the system is not steerable by any gaussian measurements .",
    "the reid criteria depend on the predictability of observables on one half of the system from measurements made on the other half .",
    "in what follows we will label the two halves as @xmath0 and @xmath1 rather than continuing with alice and bob . defining the quadrature operators for each mode as @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 with @xmath5 being a bosonic annihilation operator ,",
    "reid defines inferred quadrature variances @xmath6^{2}}{v(\\hat{x}_{j } ) } , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "v_{inf}(\\hat{y}_{i})&=&v(\\hat{y}_{i})-\\frac{[v(\\hat{y}_{i},\\hat{y}_{j})]^{2}}{v(\\hat{y}_{j } ) } , \\label{vinf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 . obviously we are also free to start with part @xmath8 , with the definitions changed by swapping the indices . when @xmath9 , we have an example of @xmath10 steering @xmath8 for gaussian measurements , whereas an observation of @xmath11 can be explained classically .",
    "this therefore means that a manifestation of @xmath12 would be an example of asymmetric steering for the case of gaussian measurements .",
    "we note here that these inequalities were rigorously defined by reid  @xcite and are the canonical method for demonstrating the epr paradox in continuous variable systems . besides being of fundamental interest in quantum theory , asymmetric",
    "steering has been suggested as a possible candidate for use in one - way quantum cryptography  @xcite and could also have potential applications in the field of quantum control .",
    "having established the inequality which we must satisfy , we now turn our attention to the two - mode system known as the intracavity kerr nonlinear coupler  @xcite .",
    "this is a device consisting of two nonlinear @xmath13 media coupled by an evanescent overlap of the guided modes inside optical cavities .",
    "a schematic of the device is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] .",
    "it is the output beams emerging from the cavities that provide a source of continuous - variable entangled states . in this work",
    "we show that asymmetric steering for gaussian measurements is possible with this device and find parameter regimes for which it is optimised .",
    "we find that the effect is large enough that it should be experimentally observable .",
    "as far as we are aware , it is not possible to produce this effect via linear optics operations on entangled states .",
    "materials act as waveguides with nonlinear interaction strengths @xmath14 and evanescent coupling strength @xmath15 are shown , along with the external coherent fields with pump strengths @xmath16 , cavity mirrors and optical modes at frequency @xmath17.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the hamiltonian describing the coherently pumped nonlinear coupler may be written as @xmath18 where the interaction hamiltonian is @xmath19 the coupling hamiltonian is @xmath20 , \\label{eq : hcouple}\\ ] ] the pumping hamiltonian is @xmath21 , \\label{eq : hpump}\\ ] ] and the reservoir damping hamiltonian is @xmath22 , \\label{eq : hres}\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 denote the bosonic annihilation operators in the first and second waveguides for the intracavity modes at frequency @xmath17 , the @xmath14 represents the nonlinear interaction strengths for the two media , the @xmath16 are the classical pumping laser amplitudes , @xmath15 is the strength of the evanescent coupling , and the @xmath23 are the annihilation operators for bath quanta , representing losses through the cavity mirror .    in order to describe the intracavity dynamics , we first derive stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) in the positive-@xmath24 representation  @xcite .",
    "this involves using a standard approach  @xcite whereby we map the quantum operator equations of motion onto a fokker - planck equation for the positive-@xmath24 representation pseudoprobability distribution of the system  @xcite , which in turn can be interpreted as a set of @xmath25-number sdes .",
    "the positive-@xmath24 method is extremely useful as it allows for the calculation of stochastic trajectory averages which correspond to the normally - ordered expectation values of quantum - mechanical operators .",
    "we define two independent stochastic fields @xmath26 and @xmath27 corresponding to the operators @xmath5 and @xmath28 , respectively , in the limit of a large number of stochastic trajectories .",
    "furthermore , we employ the usual zero - temperature born and markov approximations @xcite when dealing with the reservoir hamiltonian .",
    "the equations of motion are therefore given by ,    @xmath29    where @xmath30 are the cavity loss rates , and @xmath31 are real gaussian noise terms with correlations @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we note here that we have included the @xmath34 as detunings of the intracavity fields from resonance , where this would have been included in the free hamiltonian .",
    "using equation  [ posp ] we performed dynamical simulations to ascertain the stability of the system for the choice of parameters used in the remainder of this paper .",
    "however , as quadrature measurements are usually performed by homodyne measurements in the frequency domain to obtain output spectra , we may perform a much simpler linearized fluctuation analysis of the system to obtain our results . in particular , this analysis of the system allows one to calculate the intracavity squeezing spectra and in turn the output spectral correlations for the cavity @xcite .",
    "it is these correlations that would be measured in experiments .",
    "the linearized analysis entails treating the system dynamics as a multivariable ornstein - uhlenbeck process , with small and stable fluctuations around steady - state values  @xcite .",
    "we neglect the noise terms in equation  [ posp ] and consider the steady - state solutions of the classical version of the equations of motion . for symmetric parameters as used previously for this system  @xcite , it was possible to calculate steady - state solutions analytically . in this case , however , we calculated them numerically using a runge - kutta method and compared them with the values found from the full positive - p equations , finding excellent agreement .",
    "we then proceed to linearize the equations of motion around the steady - state solutions .",
    "specifically , we set @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the steady - state mean value and @xmath37 are fluctuations , and this gives rise to a set of equations for the fluctuations ,    @xmath38    where @xmath39^{t}$ ] , @xmath40 is the drift matrix for the fluctuations , @xmath41 is the steady - state diffusion matrix and @xmath42 is a vector of wiener increments @xcite .",
    "the intracavity spectra are then calculated most simply from the ornstein - uhlenbeck equations for the system , with the spectral matrix in the stationary state being  @xcite    @xmath43    where @xmath17 is the frequency .",
    "once the intracavity spectra have been calculated , the standard input - output relations  @xcite may be applied in order to arrive at the output spectral variances and covariances . from this",
    "we have all the information required to investigate various measures of entanglement , and moreover , study steering in this system .    to calculate these entanglement measures we need to generalise the definition of the quadrature operators given above to include arbitrary phase angles because , unlike a standard resonant @xmath44 interaction , the kerr nonlinearity and the detunings both rotate the phase of the fields at which the optimal correlations are found  @xcite . to this end",
    "we define the quadrature operator at a given angle @xmath45 as @xmath46 . for compactness",
    ", we will use the notation @xmath47 and @xmath48 , with @xmath49 and @xmath50 obviously being conjugate quadratures with the heisenberg uncertainty principle requiring @xmath51 . the reid inequality for steering and epr",
    "can then be written as @xmath52 and holds for arbitrary quadrature angle . to demonstrate asymmetric steering for the case of gaussian measurements",
    ", we need to have @xmath53 for some @xmath45 and @xmath54 for all @xmath45 .",
    "these criteria are exactly equivalent to the criteria used in the work of jones _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .    as shown in ref .",

    "what follows , we calculate and plot the output spectral reid correlations , defined in the canonical manner as the appropriate combinations of the fourier transforms of the two - time quadrature variances and covariances , treated via the standard input - output relations  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we will use the notation epr@xmath63 to signify the product of the inferred output spectral variances which signify whether @xmath10 can steer @xmath8 or not . in order to demonstrate how other commonly used criteria for the detection of entanglement do not detect the asymmetry shown by the steering inequalities",
    ", we also calculated the output spectral correlations corresponding to the duan - simon criteria  @xcite for the same parameters , defined in our notation as @xmath64 where a violation shows that the system density matrix is inseparable .",
    "we find that bipartite entanglement is always present as long as one part of the system is steerable .",
    "we note here that the same inequalities , defined above in terms of inferred variances , also hold when written in terms of the the equivalent output spectral correlations .",

    "we also show the duan - simon correlation for the same parameters , scaled so that a value of less than @xmath0 signifies bipartite entanglement .",
    "all quantities plotted in this and subsequent graphs are dimensionless.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in practice we find that the parameters for each part of the system need to be significantly unbalanced to see a large degree of asymmetric steering for gaussian measurements .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",

    "we have therefore demonstrated that asymmetric steering is possible for gaussian measurements with a relatively simple two - mode system .",

    "we see that the system exhibits both symmetric and asymmetric behaviour and can observe the transition from one type to the other . for a relatively low pumping rate and a low detuning , we observe the largest degree of asymmetric steering .",
    "this is the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : best ] . on the other hand ,",
    "symmetric steering is greatest for a large detuning and a low pumping rate . in fig .",
    "[ fig : search2](a ) and ( b ) , we follow the same procedure , except that we instead vary @xmath83 and @xmath84 . in this case , for cavity loss rates in the middle of the range and low nonlinearities the degree of asymmetric steering is at its greatest .",

    "in conclusion , we have shown that asymmetric steering for the case of gaussian measurements is possible in a bipartite system and that the intracavity nonlinear coupler is a possible candidate for an experimental demonstration of this extension of the work of einstein - podolsky - rosen and schrdinger .",
    "this effect shows that whether a system seems to need a description in terms of quantum mechanics or not can depend on which part is being measured .",
    "the important point to note here is that each receiver is allowed to make exactly the same measurements on their part of the inseparable system and obtains contradictory results .",
    "this is not a result of one receiver making inappropriate or inaccurate measurements , but is an effect which can only result from the asymmetry present in both the system and the way that steering is defined in terms of the epr paradox .",
    "the standard tests for inseparability of the system are completely unable to detect such an asymmetry and there are no possible gaussian measurements which will allow this system to be steered in both directions . as a final point , we note that this effect may have applications in such areas as quantum control and quantum cryptography ."
