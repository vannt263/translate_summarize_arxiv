    "the mobile communications industry is embarking on a wide - ranging effort to define and build the next generation of wireless systems referred to as 5 g .",
    "this is driven by large increases in mobile communications usage and expected future growth that is staggering @xcite,@xcite .",
    "5 g networks will be expected to deliver as much as 1000 times the data rate of current networks @xcite , @xcite .    as part of the 5 g initiatives",
    ", there is enormous interest in millimeter - wave ( mmwave ) bands between 30 ghz and 300 ghz @xcite-@xcite , where the available bandwidths are much larger than today s cellular bands .",
    "while millimeter - wave has historically been used for backhaul links and satellite communications , it has not been considered suitable for cellular communications due to the much higher path - loss that mmwave signals experience . in order to overcome the path - loss ,",
    "it is necessary to use antenna arrays and perform beam - forming @xcite .",
    "advances in rf and semiconductor technologies have made the use of mmwave bands more suitable for cellular communications @xcite .",
    "specifically , such advances have made it possible to have antenna arrays in areas small enough that they can be practically accommodated inside mobile devices .",
    "such beam - forming is considered an essential enabling technology for millimeter - wave communication .",
    "one distinctive characteristic of mmwave communication compared to microwave is the highly directional nature of the signal path @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the beam - formed communication makes the communication links much more directionally sensitive .",
    "obstructions can easily block the communication path ; small changes in orientation or small movements may cause _ `` deafness '' _ ( due to the transmitter and receiver antennas not being correctly pointed at each other ) @xcite .",
    "events that cause such blocking and deafness are highly unpredictable ( mobility , small movements by user , temporary vehicular and other obstructions in the environment , etc . ) .",
    "this makes it necessary to have redundant access points such that in the event of a loss of communication to an access point , the device can quickly switch to a different access point @xcite .",
    "however , switching to different access points can result in interruptions in communication , with the overall impact of the interruptions dependent on the frequency of the switching and the time the device takes to establish an alternate communication link .",
    "another distinctive characteristic is that the doppler spread at mmwave frequencies is much higher for a given speed , compared to microwave frequencies .",
    "this leads to much smaller channel coherence times compared to microwave ( for example , at 30 km / h the coherence times for 3 ghz and 30 ghz are 12 ms and 1.2 ms respectively ) , suggesting that the channel can change very rapidly .",
    "scheduling in such an environment is likely to require very frequent feedback , which tends to consume a lot of resources and energy .",
    "moreover , if the feedback communication occurs in the mmwave band , it is subject to the same link breakage constraints mentioned above .",
    "relying on the redundancy of access points , we consider an architecture in which a device maintains communication links to a number of access points .",
    "data can be transmitted from any of the access points to the device and from the device to any of the access points .",
    "we use network - coding techniques for data transmission on both the downlink and the uplink .",
    "the general idea is that such an approach is less dependent on frequent feedback , and the device continues to receive ( or transmit ) the same data stream through some sub - set of the access points even as connections to individual access points are interrupted .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : relwork ] summarizes some of the related work in the area of millimeter wave communications and network coding .",
    "section  [ sec : sysmod ] introduces the system model and describes our use of random linear network coding .",
    "we describe metrics that enable comparison of the network coding based transmissions to conventional transmissions schemes .",
    "we also derive bounds and estimates for the comparison metrics .",
    "section  [ sec : sim ] provides results of a monte - carlo system simulation performed to understand the benefits of network coding in a millimeter - wave deployment with access points deployed along a street .",
    "section  [ sec : concl ] has our concluding remarks and observations on possible future work .",
    "millimeter - wave for cellular networks has received a lot of attention recently @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the issues related to directionality of transmissions and the need for frequent handovers have been studied in @xcite .",
    "deployments of millimeter - wave access points for typical scenarios ( street - side , stadium , etc . ) are considered and it is shown that , due to the directionality and blocking properties , handovers occur much more frequently than microwave networks .    current cellular networks generally rely on the principle of having a single serving access point . however , some enhancements , which involve devices maintaining simultaneous links to different access points , have been standardized .",
    "for example , carrier aggregation in lte @xcite allows for a device to be connected to and communicate with multiple spatially separated nodes ( coordinated multi - point transmission ) .",
    "another example is dual connectivity in lte @xcite , which allows for concurrent communication with different ( spatially separated ) access points , each independently scheduling packets for the device .",
    "network coding was first proposed in @xcite as a methodology for improving throughput for multicast applications by transmitting `` combinations '' of packets .",
    "there have been some studies of applications of network coding to wireless communications @xcite-@xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there has not been any prior work on investigating the applicability of network coding to millimeter wave cellular networks .",
    "ll    0.47    &    0.47    ll    0.47    &    0.47    we consider a radio network comprising multiple relay nodes @xmath0 serving one or more devices @xmath1 as shown in figure [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "each device maintains mmwave communication links to a set of relay nodes and data is concurrently transmitted to and received from the device through the set of relay nodes .",
    "the relay nodes are connected to the network through backhaul links , which could be wired , or wireless .",
    "thus , the physical realization of the relay nodes described here could be in the form of small cells , wireless relays or remote radio heads .",
    "links between the devices and relay nodes are modeled as packet erasure channels ; @xmath2 represents the packet erasure probability of the millimeter - wave link between device @xmath3 and relay node @xmath4 . the packet erasure probabilities are time varying and their modeling is described further below .",
    "millimeter - wave channel conditions can vary rapidly as shown in [ 19 ] .",
    "in particular , a link can quickly change among line - of - sight , non - line - of - sight and outage states .",
    "our study implicitly assumes that the channel state is not known with certainty before transmitting a packet to the device .",
    "our intention is to compare performance of the network coding based data transmission via several relay nodes to a transmission approach in which non - network - coded packets are transmitted via several relay nodes .",
    "we refer to the latter approach as `` forwarding '' . in this section , we first describe random linear network coding , after which we describe the scheduling mechanisms for the downlink and the uplink communication and provide some performance bounds .",
    "given a set of @xmath5 packets @xmath6 $ ] chosen from a galois field alphabet @xmath7 , a random linear network - coded packet is constructed as @xmath8 where @xmath9 $ ] is an `` encoding vector '' consisting of a set of coefficients randomly chosen from @xmath7 . if a receiver receives @xmath5 packets",
    "@xmath10 $ ] with encoding vectors @xmath11 $ ] corresponding to each @xmath12 , it can construct a transfer matrix : @xmath13 the receiver can then recover the original packets using @xmath14^t$ ] .",
    "the probability of @xmath15 not having an inverse can be made sufficiently small by choosing a large @xmath7 .      in this study ,",
    "time is divided into time - spans , with each time span having multiple time - slots .",
    "a time - slot is the time duration of one transmission over the air - interface .",
    "a number of packets @xmath5 are to be delivered in each time - span . in each time",
    "span the transmitting side attempts to deliver the @xmath5 packets to the receiving side through relays .",
    "the forwarding approach and the network coding approach are described as follows :    * * _ forwarding _ * : for each of the @xmath5 packets , a relay node is selected .",
    "the transmitting side then performs transmissions until the packet is received . *",
    "* _ network coding _ * : for downlink communication , while the @xmath5 packets are not decoded , the transmitting side ( a ) generates a random linear network coded ( rlnc ) packet from the @xmath5 original packets , ( b ) chooses a relay node , and ( c ) transmits the rlnc packet through the chosen relay node . for the uplink communication , any relay node that has received a subset of packets forms a network coded packet from the subset and transmits it to the network .",
    "we compare the efficiency of the two approaches , which we define as the ratio of the number of packets delivered to the number of transmissions needed to deliver the packets .",
    "estimating other metrics such as throughput and delay requires specific assumptions regarding the physical layer communication ( e.g. , transmission slot duration , bandwidth , etc . ) .",
    "although we do not model such specific physical layer parameters , the efficiency metrics used are directly related to throughput and delay .",
    "for example , a higher efficiency translates to a higher data rate . a higher efficiency can also translate to lower average packet delivery delay .",
    "comparing network coding to the forwarding approach as described above is motivated by having an `` apples - to - apples '' comparison .",
    "that is , since the network coding approach uses multiple relay nodes , we compare it to an approach that does not use network coding , but still utilizes multiple relay nodes .",
    "abstracting away from the physical layer details , the forwarding approach is similar to coordinated multi - point transmission in lte  @xcite . in the following we study two types of network coding , namely : _ intra - session network coding _ for downlink communication , and _",
    "inter - session network coding _ for uplink communication .",
    "we first consider a setup in which the network is transmitting data to a single device @xmath16 through @xmath17 relay nodes . forwarding and network coding are performed as described above and the selection of relays is based on a uniform random distribution . to derive the efficiency of the two approaches ,",
    "let @xmath18 be the relay nodes , @xmath19 be the packets to be transmitted in the time - span , and @xmath20 be the packet erasure probabilities of the links from the corresponding relay nodes to @xmath16",
    ".    for the forwarding approach , given the random selection of relay nodes , each relay node is expected to transmit @xmath21 original packets on average . the expected value of the number of transmissions through relay node @xmath22 is @xmath23 .",
    "the total number of transmissions to deliver the @xmath5 packets is @xmath24 .",
    "the efficiency for the forwarding approach is therefore :    @xmath25    observing that @xmath26 , we derive an _ upper bound _ for the forwarding efficiency :    @xmath27    for the network coding approach , let @xmath28 be the rlnc packets that are transmitted through the relay nodes to deliver the original packets @xmath19 . given the random selection of relay nodes , each relay node is expected to transmit @xmath29 rlnc packets on average . of the number of rlnc packets transmitted through a given relay node , the number that is successfully received follows a binomial distribution with parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 . the expected value of the number of rlnc packets received through @xmath22 is @xmath32 .",
    "the total number of rlnc packets transmitted to deliver the @xmath5 original packets is @xmath33 . in order to decode the @xmath5 original packets , @xmath5 rlnc packets need to be received .",
    "therefore we have : @xmath34 the efficiency of the network coding approach is therefore : @xmath35    noting that @xmath36 , we derive the following _ lower bound _ for network coding : @xmath37    note that the difference between the forwarding and the network coding approaches is that for the forwarding case , a single node is responsible for delivering a particular packet leading to bound ( [ eq2 ] ) whereas for the network coding case , it is sufficient to correctly receive a total of @xmath5 packets that may have been received via multiple nodes .    to understand how the two schemes perform compared to each other ,",
    "the best ( i.e. , upper bound ) performance of forwarding is compared to the worst ( i.e. , lower bound ) performance of network coding for three different scenarios described in the following . in the first scenario , @xmath38 . in this scenario ,",
    "we get @xmath39 . that is",
    ", when all links have equal erasure probability , network coding performs at least as well as forwarding .",
    "figures [ fig : fig2 ] and [ fig : fig3 ] show a comparison of the efficiency bounds for a second and a third specific scenario respectively . for the second scenario ,",
    "figure [ fig : fig2a ] , one link from @xmath16 to one of the relays has a low packet erasure probability , while all the other links to the relays have a high packet erasure probability .",
    "for the third scenario , figure [ fig : fig2b ] , one link from @xmath16 to one of the relays has a high packet erasure probability , while all the other links have a low packet erasure probability .",
    "for both asymmetric erasure probability cases a low and high packet erasure probabilities of 0.1 and 0.6 respectively are assumed .",
    "similarly , figure [ fig : fig3 ] shows a corresponding comparison of the efficiency bounds for asymmetric cases with low and high packet erasure probabilities of 0.1 and 0.9 respectively .",
    "that is , figure [ fig : fig3a ] shows the upper bound for forwarding efficiency and the lower bound for network coding efficiency with a single link having low erasure probability and all other links having high erasure probability .",
    "figure [ fig : fig3b ] shows the upper bound for forwarding efficiency and the lower bound for network coding efficiency with a single link having high erasure probability and all other links having low erasure probabilities .",
    "the main observation from figures [ fig : fig2 ] and [ fig : fig3 ] is that the performance improvements that are expected for network coding relative to forwarding are larger for scenarios where there is a larger difference between the erasure probabilities on the different links .",
    "it is also worth emphasizing that figure [ fig : fig2 ] and figure [ fig : fig3 ] show upper and lower bounds for the forwarding efficiency and the network coding efficiency , respectively .",
    "that is , under the assumptions made above , _ forwarding is expected to perform no better than and network coding is expected to perform at least as well as the efficiency plots shown_.",
    "we now consider a setup in which devices @xmath40 , dz$ ] transmit to the network through relay nodes @xmath41 \\cdots , r_n$ ] . the goal is to compare the efficiency of the backhaul usage for forwarding and network coding .",
    "each device transmits one packet in a time span , with re - transmissions as necessary to ensure that at least one of the relay nodes receives the packet . for the forwarding approach",
    ", each relay node simply transmits to the network the packets that it has received . for the network coding approach , each relay node constructs network - coded packets from the original packets it has received and transmits them to the network over the backhaul link . specifically ,",
    "if a relay node does not receive a packet from a particular device , it uses an encoding coefficient of 0 corresponding to that device ; otherwise , a non - zero encoding coefficient is randomly chosen .",
    "once an adequate number of packets are received to be able to decode the original packets at the network side in the time span , the relay nodes do not transmit further network - coded packets during that time span .    to calculate the backhaul efficiency ,",
    "let @xmath42 be the packets from @xmath43 in a time span .",
    "let @xmath44 be the packet erasure probabilities for the links from @xmath3 to @xmath18 .",
    "as mentioned above , each device @xmath3 transmits its packet @xmath45 until it is received by at least one of the relay nodes .",

    "is obtained for the scenario in which @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , case is discussed at the end of this section . ] and the bound derivation for the _ asymmetric _ erasure probability cases is left as future work .",

    "( [ eq : phi_ub1 ] ) .",
    "since the network coding bound is derived only for the case of symmetric link erasure probability , we compare in this section the backhaul efficiency for both forwarding and network coding assuming @xmath78 , and leave the analysis of the general case to section [ subsec - upsim ] .",

    "the range of @xmath64 for which @xmath84 is defined corresponds to @xmath85 . additionally , increasing the code length @xmath60 increases the range over which @xmath84 is defined . *",
    "the network coding efficiency is close to 1 for a range of erasure probabilities . as code length @xmath60 increases the range of erasure probabilities for which the efficiency is close to 1 grows . * for medium to high erasure probabilities , the network coding lower bound in eq ( [ eq : beffc ] )",
    "deviates significantly from the simulated network coding backhaul efficiency .",
    "the following is an explanation for this deviation .",
    "note that eq ( [ eq : beffc ] ) does not take into account which relay nodes transmit the packets .",
    "consequently , it includes cases where a relay node transmits redundant packets to the network ( for example , a relay node may transmit a first network coded packet based on an encoding vector @xmath86 $ ] and a later network coded packet based on an encoding vector @xmath87 $ ] , where @xmath88 , and @xmath89 are randomly chosen coefficients from alphabets of the field ) .",
    "in the computation of the simulated network coding backhaul efficiencies , transmission of such redundant packets is avoided .",
    "the redundant transmissions cause a gap between the lower bound and the simulated backhaul efficiency , and the size of the gap increases with increasing erasure probabilities . deriving a tighter lower bound for the network coding backhaul efficiency by avoiding transmission of redundant network coded packets",
    "is a topic for further study .",
    "we make a final remark regarding the @xmath90 case . if relay nodes transmit their respective network coded packets at the same time , it is possible that one network coded packet from each relay node ( i.e. , @xmath17 network coded packets ) is transmitted to the network although fewer than @xmath17 network coded packets are needed to decode the @xmath60 packets . in such a case ,",
    "the upper bound on the number of backhaul transmissions would be @xmath91 .",
    "thus , if @xmath90 and @xmath64 is small , there can be redundant transmissions , which in turn reduces the backhaul efficiency for network coding .",

    "the median network coding backhaul efficiency is approximately 63% , 123% and 352% better than the median forwarding backhaul efficiency for inter - relay distance of 80 , 60 and 30 meters , respectively .",
    "the improvement in backhaul efficiencies directly translate to reduction in backhaul traffic - for example , the 100% improvement in backhaul efficiency due to network coding with 4 devices for the @xmath102 meter case corresponds to a 50% reduction in backhaul traffic .",
    "we have analyzed and quantified the benefits of random linear network coding in millimeter - wave communication systems with a dense deployment of access points , where individual links show a lot of variation . for our analysis and comparisons",

    "this implies that network coding is expected to outperform forwarding , with the difference being dependent on the diversity of packet erasure probabilities for the links .",
    "we have derived a lower bound on the uplink backhaul efficiency of the network coding for the case of user - to - relay links with equal packet erasure probability .",
    "the bound is applicable to a range of erasure probabilities ( low to medium ) and implies that network coding can maintain a backhaul efficiency of close to 1 even for small network code lengths .",
    "the range of erasure probabilities for which the bound is applicable increases with increasing network code lengths .",
    "we also provided a tight approximation for the backhaul efficiency for the forwarding case . comparing the lower bound of network coding to the approximate backhaul efficiency of forwarding",
    ", we have shown that network coding offers not only a much higher efficiency ( multiple times better ) but also a universal backhaul efficiency close to one for the applicable region of erasure probabilities .",
    "for the simulation , we use a millimeter wave channel model along with probabilities of links being in outage , non - line - of sight or line - of - sight , to capture the rapidly changing nature of the individual links . for the downlink intra - session network coding ,",
    "our results show a significant improvement in the efficiency of air - interface transmissions with the use of network coding .",
    "the extent of improvement depends on the density of the relay nodes ( as represented by the parameter @xmath94 ) .",
    "for example , with relay nodes deployed every 30 m on each side of the street , we see a median improvement of 35% in efficiency , which in turn translates to correspondingly higher data rates and shorter transmission durations .    for the uplink inter - session network coding ,",
    "our results show a significant improvement in the efficiency of backhaul transmissions with the use of network coding .",
    "for example , with relay nodes every 60 m on each side of the street , we see a median improvement in backhaul efficiency of 100% with 4 devices and 123% with 8 devices ( i.e. 50% and 55% lower backhaul traffic for the same number of packets respectively ) .",
    "it is remarked that this study aimed to characterize fundamental benefits of network coding in 5 g wireless networks . to achieve this goal a few assumptions about the physical layer transmission procedures and protocols are made to simplify the system model .",
    "therefore , our observations and comparison metrics are useful only in a relative sense . in order to understand the performance of network coding in more absolute terms ( e.g. , spectral efficiency improvement in b / s / hz or latency reduction in milliseconds ) it is necessary to have a more comprehensive study using a detailed physical layer channel structure .",
    "the details of such channel models will be discussed in the coming months in standards bodies such as 3gpp .",
