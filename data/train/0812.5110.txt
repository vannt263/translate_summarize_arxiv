    "finite and low - dimensional quantum systems often possess statistical properties whose deviations from universality contain some basic dynamical information about the system  @xcite . a recurring challenge is to understand",
    "precisely what information is buried in those statistical deviations and how to extract it . before that can be addressed ,",
    "the universal behaviors themselves must be understood . at the heart of many such universalities",
    "generally lurks a connection to the bohigas - giannoni - schmit ( bgs ) conjecture  @xcite , which asserts that systems with underlying chaotic dynamics have the fluctuation properties found in random matrix theory  @xcite .",
    "if interest lies in quantities for which the position representation of the eigenfunctions is critical , a random plane wave model is often introduced that augments the bgs conjecture  @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of extracting system specific information can then proceed , but generally requires a more powerful theory .",
    "the preponderance of statistical measures heretofore introduced for analysis are local in energy , configuration space , or both .",
    "examples are given by the dyson - mehta cluster functions  @xcite , and the amplitude distribution and short - range two - point correlation function @xmath0 of a given eigenfunction , @xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand , there has been a rather recent introduction of new , non - local statistical measures  @xcite .",
    "they have been motivated by the need to understand the interplay between interferences and interactions in mesoscopic systems .",
    "for example , one place where this interplay is known to have an important role is the addition spectra of quantum dots ; other examples are coming from cold fermionic gasses .",
    "focussing on just one motivation , the addition spectrum is experimentally accessible through the position of the conductance peaks in coulomb blockade transport measurements @xcite .",
    "fluctuations of peak spacings are associated with interference effects , and experimentally are clearly incompatible with a non - interacting description of the conduction electrons in the dots .",
    "indeed , a non - interacting description predicts a strong bimodality of the peak spacing distribution  associated with an odd - even character of the number of ( spin-@xmath2 ) electrons  and this is not observed .",
    "assuming further that the dot possesses a chaotic dynamics , the distribution for odd-@xmath3 spacings should show a characteristic wigner surmise shape , whereas a density similar to a gaussian with extended tails is observed .",
    "at first , it was argued that a non - fermi liquid description of the interacting electrons might be necessary to interpret the experimental data .",
    "however , the picture which has now emerged @xcite is that although an understanding of both peak spacings and ground state spin distributions is still incomplete , it is reasonable to expect that most phenomena will eventually be explained within a fermi liquid framework .",
    "more specifically , the electrons can be thought of as quasi - particles confined by a potential @xmath4 , which could in practice be computed within a self - consistent thomas - fermi - like approximation @xcite .",
    "they also interact weakly through a screened coulomb interaction @xmath5 . for dots significantly larger than the screening length",
    ", confinement does not modify appreciably the screening process , and the bulk expression for @xmath6 is appropriate .",
    "furthermore , for the experimentally relevant gas parameter @xmath7 being of order one , the screening length is not much different from the fermi wavelength @xmath8 . under these circumstances ,",
    "the problem is well described by the short range approximation @xmath9 with @xmath10 the mean local density of states ( including the spin degeneracy ) ( @xmath11 for @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 the dimensionless fermi liquid parameter @xcite ( for @xmath12 and @xmath7 of order one , @xmath13 is in the range 0.6 - 0.8 ) .",
    "boundaries could potentially modify this picture somewhat , but it is expected that a slightly modified @xmath13 would be sufficient to capture the effects ; since this is not the focus of our study , we leave it for future consideration .    in this approximation",
    ", the first order contribution of the residual interactions to the ground state energy can be expressed in the simple form @xmath14 with @xmath15 the unperturbed ground state density of particles with spin @xmath16 .",
    "this expression was the starting point for a study demonstrating the increased importance of @xmath17 if the dynamics are not fully chaotic  @xcite .    because @xmath18 can be expressed as a sum over the absolute square of single particle eigenfunctions which are occupied , the mesoscopic fluctuations of the residual energy term @xmath19 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eri ] ) , or of similar quantities , are related to the fluctuations of the one - particle eigenstates of the unperturbed system . however , in contrast to the correlation function @xmath20 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : eri ] ) involves both an integration over space and summation over energy , and therefore in this way , it is probing new aspects of the fluctuation properties of the eigenstates .",
    "the goal of this paper is to follow up on our recent work  @xcite on the average and fluctuating parts of the quantity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eri ] ) in several ways . to begin with a complete account",
    "is given of two theoretical approaches using random plane waves and semiclassical theory .",
    "as already shown , for fully chaotic quantized billiards the two methods give identical leading functional dependence on wave vector and system size for average and fluctuation properties .",
    "in addition , the significant differences between dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions , can be understood . on the other hand , in the statistical limit of uniformity ,",
    "the fluctuation properties differ in two ways in the prefactor .",
    "the semiclassical treatment in the spirit of the gutzwiller trace formula  @xcite helps identify dynamical correlations and a term missing from the expressions derived with the random plane wave model .",
    "thus , the gutzwiller periodic orbit approach provides both a deeper understanding of the mechanism underlying the fluctuations and a good quantitative agreement with exact numerical calculations for the examples considered .",
    "next , non - fully chaotic systems are partially addressed .",
    "the fluctuations are found to be greatly magnified in two essential ways .",
    "one relates to non - uniform projected classical densities and the other to enhanced dependence on wave vector and system size .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "ii , the necessary background material and notations are introduced , including a more precise definition of the statistical quantities to be studied .",
    "also introduced in this section is the random plane wave model , which is then used to analyze in sect .",
    "iii the mean and fluctuating behaviors .",
    "the random plane wave modeling reproduces quite accurately the mean behaviors , but it fails by most of an order of magnitude to predict quantitatively the fluctuations .",
    "this motivates the introduction in sect .",
    "iv of the semiclassical analysis in terms of classical trajectories .",
    "this approach corrects the random plane wave method overestimate of the fluctuations . in sect .",
    "v , extended semiclassical methods are introduced for systems which are not fully chaotic .",
    "finally sect .",
    "vi contains a discussion and summary .",
    "to begin , it is worth motivating the introduction of a non - local statistical measure in a little more detail .",
    "for example , consider two - degree - of - freedom chaotic quantized billiard systems with one body eigenstates @xmath21 and energies @xmath22 . in the absence of interactions , the many - body eigenstates are slater determinants characterized by spin - dependent occupation numbers @xmath23 or @xmath24 . within the short range approximation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : vsr ] ) , the contribution of the residual interactions to the ground state can be written in first order perturbation theory as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mean single particle level spacing in the neighborhood of the fermi surface .",
    "@xmath27 is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the area of the billiard .",
    "with this definition , the @xmath30 are dimensionless quantities with a mean value expected to be roughly equal to unity for @xmath31 , and to three for @xmath32 .",
    "these expectations would apply to uncorrelated gaussian random amplitudes assuming time reversal invariance holds ; ahead more precise results are derived .    of main interest",
    "is how the value of @xmath33 changes when a particle is promoted from one orbital to another ( as opposed to the variations of the residual energy as particles are added into the system ) .",
    "consider that the ground state of the non - interacting @xmath3-particle system is such that the levels below the fermi energy are doubly occupied except for the last level @xmath34 , which may be singly or doubly occupied depending on the parity of @xmath3 .",
    "promoting a particle from the orbital @xmath34 to @xmath35 has a one - particle energy cost @xmath36 .",
    "if however this is compensated by the corresponding difference in residual energy , the ground state occupation numbers @xmath37 will be modified by the interactions , yielding in some circumstances non trivial , i.e. different from @xmath38 or @xmath2 , ground state spins .",
    "imagining @xmath39 in the form of a ( square or nearly square ) symmetric matrix , shifting an occupancy from one level to another subtracts the column or row being vacated and adds a column or row to the newly occupied orbital ( row or column depends on the spins of the removed and added particles ) . apart from a couple individual @xmath27 s near the diagonal ,",
    "the difference in the residual interaction can therefore be expressed in terms of the difference of two sums of the form @xmath40 as the @xmath30 are positive definite , @xmath41 has a locally defined , increasing - with - index , positive mean .",
    "however , because one column or row is added and another subtracted , their means largely cancel , and thus the mean @xmath41 behavior can not be involved in altering the ground state occupancies of the single particle levels defined by @xmath4 .",
    "[ the mean of the few individual @xmath27 s near the diagonal not included in @xmath42 might though .",
    "] however , if the fluctuations of @xmath42 or @xmath30 are sufficiently large , they have the potential to alter the nature of the ground state .",
    "thus , statistical measures based on the properties of the @xmath42 are of fundamental interest , in particular their mean values and fluctuations .",
    "the @xmath42 have the unusual character that they are integrated over space and involve a sum over eigenenergies .",
    "their investigation thus requires two basic ingredients . with the definition @xmath43 @xmath42",
    "can be expressed as @xmath44 with the understanding that @xmath45 ( and assuming for simplicity that there are no degeneracies ) .",
    "one of the two required ingredients is the behavior of @xmath46 .",
    "as it results from a summation over the absolute square of eigenstates up to a certain energy , it is dominated by a secular behavior ; see fig .  13 in ref .",
    "@xcite for example .",
    "the secular component @xmath47 emerges from an energy smoothing which , although local , is also necessarily broader than the thouless energy  @xcite ; ahead the notation @xmath48 is introduced to denote this averaging .",
    "this energy smoothing implies that only dynamics on a time scale shorter than the shortest periodic orbit is relevant , and thus this decomposition is independent of whether the system dynamics is regular , fully chaotic or has some other character .",
    "@xmath47 has been shown to be given by an excellent semiclassical ( asymptotic ) approximation @xcite @xmath49\\ ] ] where the coordinate @xmath50 is defined locally as the perpendicular distance from the boundary , @xmath51 is the magnitude of the wave vector at energy @xmath52 , and the @xmath53 sign is for neumann boundary conditions and the @xmath54 sign for dirichlet . here",
    "@xmath55 refers to just the leading term of the weyl formula , @xmath56 .",
    "the validity is governed by @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a length scale , specified ahead in the paper , but which necessarily must be shorter than the width of the system .",
    "away from the boundary , the secular behavior approaches an overall constant .",
    "however , the existence of boundary conditions and a minimum wavelength scale combine to create persistent oscillations ( friedel oscillations ) , which are maximal near the boundary and which fade away toward the interior of the billiard . the negative sign of the bessel function for dirichlet boundary conditions respects the vanishing of eigenfunctions at the boundary as it must .",
    "note that just as the critical portion of the density of states can be expressed as a series with volume , boundary , curvature , and oscillatory components , the same is true of @xmath59 .",
    "the above expression does not include the curvature components and must therefore be missing at least part of the @xmath60^{-2})$ ] corrections .",
    "as noted @xmath61 is a smooth function of the parameter @xmath52 , but @xmath42 actually involves @xmath62 , which changes abruptly at the points where the energy surpasses each eigenvalue ( i.e.  is a function of @xmath63 ) . the former quantity does not have a monotonous dependence in the number of particles @xmath63 since @xmath22 contains the gutzwiller corrections from periodic orbit theory @xcite that determine the precise positions of the levels .",
    "we therefore consider instead the slightly modified and properly normalized decomposition @xmath64 \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath65 is the billiard perimeter and not to be confused with length scale @xmath58 mentioned above .",
    "this decomposition has the further advantage that the fluctuations @xmath66 not contained in the secular behavior average to zero when integrated over space . in this way ,",
    "density of states oscillations , which are not of interest here , do not get intertwined with the fluctuations that are the focus of this study . to the order of corrections incorporated in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nre2 ] ) , @xmath67 can equally be defined as @xmath68 or as the mean value obtained from the weyl series .",
    "the other main necessary ingredient is the behavior of @xmath69 which leads to the two principal approaches contained in this paper .",
    "one approach is to rely upon a statistical model which uses an ensemble of random plane waves to mimic the properties of chaotic eigenstates@xcite and the other is to use a semiclassical theory building on the work of bogomolny  @xcite .",
    "we begin with the random plane wave modeling as it is technically simpler .",
    "the random plane wave model @xcite has been introduced in which the eigenstates are represented , in the absence of any symmetry by a random superposition of plane waves @xmath70 with wave - vectors of fixed modulus @xmath71 distributed isotropically .",
    "time reversal invariance may be introduced as a correlation between time reversed plane waves such that the eigenfunctions are real .",
    "similarly , the presence of a planar boundary imposes a constraint between the coefficients of plane waves related by a sign change of the normal component of the wave - vector @xmath72 . near a boundary , and",
    "using a system of coordinates @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath75 the vectors respectively perpendicular and parallel to the boundary ( of norm @xmath50 and norm @xmath76 ) , eigenfunctions are therefore locally mimicked statistically by a superposition , @xmath77 where @xmath78 for dirichlet and @xmath79 for neumann boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the phase angle @xmath80 , the real amplitude @xmath81 , and the orientation of the wave vector @xmath82 , are all chosen randomly .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath81 are zero - centered independent gaussian random variables with @xmath83 .    to complete the model",
    ", it is necessary to determine the variance @xmath84 which is fixed by the normalization of the wavefunctions . here",
    "this constraint is imposed only on average , rather than for each individual state .",
    "a priori , proceeding in this way might be expected to miss weak correlations between the eigenfunctions .",
    "the question is whether one should expect them to be insignificant . in principle",
    ", the answer is yes , but only if local properties of the eigenfunctions are being considered and the effective dimensionality is large as it would be for @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the fermi wave vector .",
    "this issue is further discussed in the semiclassical theory of sect .",
    "[ sec : gutzwiller ] ahead .    using the random plane wave representation eq .",

    "for example , it would emerge for integrable systems as well assuming the averaging is over energy intervals greater than the thouless energy .",
    "finally , note that from the correction to unity of the leading constant in this expression , one sees that if the boundary conditions are dirichlet , the local mean behavior of @xmath96 well into the interior is slightly elevated above @xmath97 to compensate for the reduced density near the boundary , and just the opposite for neumann boundary conditions .",

    "the importance of the bouncing ball modes is quite visible .     and the density of states from the even - even stadium eigenstates using dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "the dashed line is for the density of states ( which has a different vertical scale shown at the right side).,title=\"fig:\",width=325 ]",
    "the mean and variance of the quantities @xmath278 treated in  @xcite and in greater detail in this paper have been introduced as examples of a new , and non - local , class of statistical measures with physical relevance ; the @xmath278 are connected to the addition spectrum of quantum dots . by no means should they be taken as the only possible measures representing this class . indeed , in recent works on finite - size fluctuation properties in ultracold fermi gasses  @xcite , involving fluctuations in the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer pairing gap , a quantity was introduced for the order parameter that is similar to the @xmath278 , though with additional complications . not surprisingly , several common features are found for both quantities . as the fluctuations are dominated by a term arising from the interplay of the friedel and eigenstate oscillations",

    "this implies that the corresponding residual interaction contributions will in that case become larger than the mean level spacing @xmath26 .",
    "in other words , since @xmath26 is the energy scale set by the one particle energies , the fluctuations in the residual interactions may become large enough that they generate a modification in the ground state orbital occupation number , and more generally reach a point where a first order perturbation treatment of the interactions is not adequate .",

    "inclusion of the variance improved the theory considerably as the mean square largely overestimated the prefactor .",

    "<S> a quintessential example comes from the desire to understand the short - range approximation to the first order ground state contribution of the residual coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> billiards , fully chaotic or otherwise , provide an ideal class of systems on which to focus as they have proven to be successful in modeling the single particle properties of a landau - fermi liquid in typical mesoscopic systems , i.e.  closed or nearly closed quantum dots . </S>",
    "<S> it happens that both theoretical approaches give fully consistent results for measure averages , but that somewhat surprisingly for fully chaotic systems the semiclassical theory gives a much improved approximation for the fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the theories highlights a couple of key shortcomings inherent in the random plane wave approach . </S>",
    "<S> this paper contains a complete account of the theoretical approaches , elucidates the two shortcomings of the oft - relied - upon random plane wave approach , and treats non - fully chaotic systems as well . </S>"
