    "robustness is one of the most important properties of complex networks and has been widely explored on single networks in the last decade@xcite",
    ". however , complex systems are rarely isolated .",
    "the more casual situation is that networks usually interact with other networks such as transportation networks and financial systems@xcite . in the case of interdependent networks ,",
    "conclusions are often far different from single networks . in particular",
    ", a removal of a very small fraction of nodes can lead to catastrophic failures on the whole network@xcite . a theoretical framework based on percolation theory",
    "has been established to analyze the resilience of interdependent systems@xcite , and much details have been explored@xcite .",
    "the fraction of interdependent nodes is one important factor that will influence the phase transition of the networks@xcite .",
    "also , the overlap of links can significantly change the properties of the percolation , and there is a critical point above which the emergence of the mutually connected component is continuous@xcite .",
    "the presence of degree correlations in multiplex networks can modify drastically the percolation threshold@xcite .",
    "most previous models have focused on interdependent random and scale - free networks in which space restrictions are not considered .",
    "however , many real - world systems such as power grid networks and computer networks are embedded in two - dimensional space@xcite . in interdependent random and scale - free networks ,",
    "the overlap of links and degree correlations will change the properties of phase transition .",
    "nevertheless for spatially embedded interdependent networks which are modeled as square lattices , the overlap of links or the degree correlations of nodes lose their significance , since their network topologies are identical .",
    "the spatially interdependent networks are extremely vulnerable .",
    "any fraction of interdependent nodes will lead to first order transition@xcite . from an identical dependency map to totally random dependency map , the randomness of the dependency map may be one of the most important factors leading to the emergence of discontinuous percolation . in most real interdependent systems , dependencies are neither totally random nor identical .",
    "research on the resilience of intermediate systems that lie somewhere in between these two extremes is of high practical significance and needs further exploration .    from this perspective",
    ", we study the relationship between the dependency s randomness and stability of the system of two interdependent spatially embedded networks .",
    "we use approximate entropy(@xmath0 ) as the measure of randomness .",
    "one of the big challenges here is how to introduce controlled degree of randomness into the system .",
    "therefore , we propose an intermediate model which describes the system with dependency map between identical map and totally random map .",
    "inspired by the constructing procedure of the watt - strogatz small - world model@xcite , starting from an identical dependency map , we rewire each dependency link at random with probability @xmath4 . by increasing @xmath4 from @xmath5 to @xmath6 ,",
    "the @xmath0 increases monotonically .",
    "therefore , the traverse of randomness can be generally represented by @xmath4 .",
    "we reveal that there is a critical value @xmath7 , for which the percolation transition becomes continuous , whereas for any @xmath8 the collapse is discontinuous . changing the topologies on a single layer , we discover that @xmath7 is different for interdependent scale - free networks , watts - strogatz networks , and erds - rnyi networks . the critical threshold increases with @xmath4 when @xmath9 and remains approximately constant when @xmath10 .",
    "additionally , we present an analytical method for time scale of cascade failures based on critical p and find that the four topologies display rich transient properties when @xmath4 changes from @xmath5 to @xmath6 . finally , we analyze the influence of limited dependency length on spatial networks .",
    "we show that with the same dependency length , a linearly dependent system is always continuous , but not continuous for some locally randomly dependent system .",
    "our results show that the randomness of dependency may be one of important factors for extreme vulnerability of spatially interdependent systems .",
    "our model of interdependent networks is realized via two networks(@xmath11 ) a and b under full dependency . here",
    "one network is the copy of the opposite network and their average degree @xmath12(the same as a square lattice ) .",
    "the degree distribution of the scale - free network is @xmath13 where @xmath14 . in each network",
    ", each node has two types of links : connectivity link and dependency link .",
    "also every node in network a is connected with one and only one node in network b. for a square lattice , each node is connected to its four nearest neighbors within the same lattice via connectivity links .",
    "all dependencies in our model are mutual and bidirectional . dependency is taken to mean that if a node in network a is removed from the system and a node in b that depends on it will be removed from b as well .",
    "thus failures of nodes iterate until mutually connected giant component of both networks emerges .",
    "this process is called cascade failures and see methods for details of cascade process of the system .",
    "there are two extreme situations .",
    "i ) node @xmath15 in a depends on node @xmath16 in the b such that @xmath17 .",
    "we call it identity dependency map(fig.[fig1].*a * ) .",
    "ii ) the random dependency map as most papers considered(fig.1.*b * ) . like the constructing procedure of the watt - strogatz small - world model ,",
    "starting from the identity dependency map , we rewire each dependency link at random with probability @xmath4 , while guaranteeing that each node in a depends on one and only one node in b(@xmath18 ) .",
    "we sample @xmath19 and plot them in fig.1 .    note : we must figure out that our model is different from partially interdependent lattices proposed by amir bashan et al@xcite . in partially interdependent lattices , there are interdependent lattices with a fraction @xmath4 of interdependent nodes and the remaining @xmath20 of nodes autonomous . in our model , however , the remaining @xmath20 nodes are connected with the identical nodes in opposite network .",
    "the subtle difference between these two models will lead to huge difference in cascade failure process .",
    "we will illustrate it in fig.[fig2 ] . in fig.[fig2 ]",
    ", we can see that the cascade failures process differs much between these two models : with the same @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the size of the giant component in our model is @xmath23 , while the size of giant component in partially interdependent networks is @xmath24 .",
    "this apparently show that the our model is different partially interdependent lattices .",
    "entropy can be used to measure the randomness effectively@xcite . in fact , approximate entropy(@xmath0 ) is adopted in this paper for computation convenience .",
    "when @xmath25 , @xmath0 is nearly 0 , and when @xmath26 , it reaches its maximum .",
    "the @xmath0 is a continuous and monotonically increasing function of @xmath4(fig.3 ) .",
    "however the randomness is not fully represented by rewiring dependency links , since the locally randomly interdependent lattice@xcite in which @xmath26 is not totally randomly interdependent but with length constraints . then considering a more casual situation ,",
    "the permutation of @xmath27 can not be exhausted by rewiring the dependency links of identical mapping at probability @xmath4 .",
    "but as the approximate entropy changes continuously with @xmath4 , we can change @xmath4 to generally represent all approximate entropies .    through simulation",
    ", we find that there is a critical @xmath28 for an interdependent lattice network below which the percolation is second - order but first - order above . in fig.4 , we can see that for @xmath29 , the decrease of giant component occurs in multiple steps , characteristic of a second - order transition . for @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    ", the giant component may completely collapse by removal of a small fraction of nodes , characteristic of a first - order transition(fig.4 ) . @xmath2",
    "increases with @xmath4 . when @xmath4 is relatively small , @xmath2 increases approximately linearly . and",
    "when @xmath32 , @xmath2 remains almost constant , i.e. as more random the dependency is , as more fragile is the system .",
    "analogously , for interdependent scale - free networks , watts - strogatz networks and erds - rnyi networks , there is also a critical @xmath7 .",
    "we find that @xmath33 .",
    "additionally @xmath2 of lattice networks is generally greater than that of other networks .",
    "smaller fraction @xmath34 will lead to cascade failures .",
    "this means that an interdependent scale - free network is most robust under random attacks , while the square lattice is most vulnerable .",
    "a random network is more stable than a small - world one .",
    "the time scale of cascade failures , i.e. the time that the interdependent networks need to collapse to the stationary state is one evidently important merit for system s resilience .",
    "the number of iterations ( noi ) increases and reaches its peak at the critical @xmath7 and goes quickly down to a small value with @xmath35 ( fig.5 ) .",
    "so the noi at @xmath2 is an effective measure for time scale of the system .",
    "the noi at @xmath2 ( i.e.@xmath36 ) is a function of @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath36 increases quickly with @xmath4 when @xmath37 and declines very gently above @xmath7 for interdependent lattice networks . for a scale - free network ,",
    "it increases until @xmath7 and then starts to decline . for random networks and small - world networks ,",
    "it increases monotonously with @xmath4 but the variation tendency becomes gentle above @xmath7(fig.6 ) .",
    "all four interdependent systems have variation tendency s changes around @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath36 of interdependent lattice networks is greater than those of scale - free , small - world and random networks when @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath36 of interdependent square lattice is smaller than those of all other three network types when @xmath39 .",
    "the noi reflects the time scale of system collapse .",
    "our results show that the transient characteristics of the four systems go through rich changes with the variation of @xmath4 .",
    "finally we check locally interdependent networks in which the distance between two interdependent nodes is limited(@xmath40 i.e. @xmath41 and @xmath42 in reference@xcite ) . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider one more special condition . here",
    "we split the whole network into @xmath43 small blocks and dependency links are randomized within each block .",
    "we find that there is critical distance @xmath44 under which the percolation is continuous but discontinuous above @xmath45(fig.7 ) .",
    "the @xmath45 is greater than @xmath46 in @xcite because the randomness(approximate entropy ) here is lower than that in @xcitewith the same distance .",
    "the corresponding approximate entropy @xmath47 of @xmath45 is approximately equal to @xmath1 .",
    "compared with locally random dependency , the linear dependency map is more robust . for the linear dependency map ,",
    "the percolation is always continuous(fig.7 ) .",
    "although the dependency distance changes strongly , the approximate entropies of those dependency maps are almost equal to @xmath5 .",
    "so their percolation properties are nearly the same as that of a single lattice .",
    "it is thus clear that the randomness may be a more important factor leading to cascade failures than dependency distance .",
    "furthermore , it is possible that the randomness of dependency is related to other metrics of interdependent networks such as dimension .",
    "the dimension of networks is a function of the distribution of link lengths@xcite . for spatially embedded networks ,",
    "the dimension is one of the most fundamental quantities to characterize its structure and very likely will influence its percolation property@xcite .",
    "however , how interdependency relationships between networks change the dimension of the system has not been figured out . in reference",
    "@xcite , the authors discover that the dependency length play an critical role in the percolation transition .",
    "however , we found that under linear dependency map , the change of dependency length influence the percolation property little . from the discrepancy of those two situations ,",
    "it can be inferred that local property of dependency relationship make a big difference . and the local property of dependency will directly influence the local topological inter - similarity between networks .",
    "randomness happen to reflects the local property of dependency ( we can see this from the computation steps of approximate entropy in methods ) . in spatially interdependent embedded networks ,",
    "the local characteristics of dependency can be more intuitively characterized as the relative length of dependency links . under linear dependency map ,",
    "the relative length of dependency links and the approximate entropy of dependency map are nearly @xmath5 .",
    "no matter how large @xmath48 is , they changes little and are still nearly @xmath5 , so the percolation changes little . on the other hand ,",
    "the smaller the relative length is , the less dimension is changed from that of single network .",
    "there should exit some relations between dimension and the randomness of the dependency map .",
    "in many real interdependent systems such as coupled power grid and communication network , the dependency relationship is neither completely regular nor completely random , but lies somewhere between these two extremes .",
    "the transition from regular to random dependency is one of the keys to extreme vulnerability of spatially interdependent systems . from the proposed intermediate cascade failure model ( from regular to random dependency ) , we find there is a transform from continuous percolation to discontinuous percolation with the randomness variation of the dependency map between two interdependent networks .",
    "we emphasize the generic character of our model because the dependency map could influence not only the resilience but also synchronization , disease spreading and other dynamic process in interdependent networks . with suitable modification",
    ", our model could be applied to understand the dynamical process in most real interdependent systems since the dependency maps between networks are more various and complicated instead of totally random dependency or regular dependency .",
    "the time scale of cascade failures is evidently important for system s resilience , but it has received little attentions in the analysis of resilience so far . in different dynamic processes ,",
    "the characteristic time scales of systems vary greatly . for instance biological systems , social systems and financial market dynamics have time scale much longer than that of cascade failures of power grid .",
    "our analytic method based on critical p is simple and effective for characterizing the time scale of different systems .",
    "generally , the system which has a shorter time scale demands higher requirements for our responding speed to catastrophe and brings much bigger challenges for us to take mitigation actions than those with longer time scale . therefore , our method may provide a clue for research on revealing the transient mechanism and mitigation of cascade failures in interdependent networks .",
    "the randomness of the dependency maps the interdependent square lattice is measured by approximate entropy .",
    "entropy can effectively reflects the randomness of a sequence . however ,",
    "for computation convenience , we choose the approximate entropy as the measure of the randomness of the system .",
    "the approximate entropy is denoted by @xmath0 and is computed by following steps@xcite :                          the percolation transition is studied by randomly removing a fraction @xmath61 of nodes and the links attached to them from both networks simultaneously .",
    "then , on each network , clusters which are detached from the largest connected component are removed .",
    "after that , the nodes in each network which lost their supporting nodes in the opposite network are removed .",
    "this in turn causes more clusters to break off from the giant component and this process is continued until no more clusters break off .",
    "first , we analyze the situation with totally random dependency maps . after the initial attack",
    ", only @xmath62 remains functional .",
    "each node in a that is removed causes the removal of its interdependent node in b. then only @xmath63 nodes in b remain alive .",
    "this produces further damage in a and causes cascading failures .",
    "the cascade failures can be represented by the recursive equation for the survived fraction @xmath64@xcite .",
    "@xmath65 in the limit @xmath66 , eq.(1 ) yields the equation for the mutual giant component at the steady state , @xmath67 equation ( 2 ) can be solved graphically by the intersection between the curve @xmath68 and the straight line @xmath69 .",
    "next , we consider the mutual percolation for more casual situations where the dependency is not totally random . for every dependency link",
    ", there is a probability @xmath4 to rewire it at random .",
    "this is equivalent to the situation with a fraction @xmath20 nodes mapping to itself and the remaining @xmath4 nodes have a random dependency map .",
    "the case of @xmath26 corresponds to the scenario of a random dependency map and @xmath25 is identical to the conventional percolation on a single lattice . for the initial attack which destroys a fraction @xmath61 of nodes ,",
    "@xmath70 nodes are removed .",
    "we compute the probability @xmath71 that one node in a depends on the same node in b. for @xmath72 nodes in totally random dependency networks , the number of nodes @xmath73 in the same location of both networks is @xcite : @xmath74 @xmath75 when @xmath72 is very large , the computation of @xmath76 is very inconvenient . for computation simplication , when @xmath77 , we have : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the euler s number and @xmath80 is the integer part of @xmath81 .",
    "then , @xmath82 so for each node , the probability that it is in the same location of a and b is : @xmath83 when @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "the initial attack causes some number of nodes to be disconnected from the giant component in both networks a and b. furthermore , because of the dependency relationship , the nodes disconnected from a will lead to further damages . @xmath86 increases with @xmath71 .",
    "the greater @xmath71 is , the more nodes disconnected from the giant component of a overlap the nodes in b. so further damage decreases and cascade failures are weakened ( or prevented ) from the beginning . for @xmath25 ,",
    "the cascade failures are prevented from the start and the percolation is continuous .",
    "when @xmath87 , the totally random dependency map will lead to a first - order transition .",
    "as @xmath4 increases , the percolation transition changes from a continuous transition to a discontinuous one .",
    "there must be one critical @xmath7 beyond which the percolation transition become discontinuous .",
