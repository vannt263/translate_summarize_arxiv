    "the connections between complexity , nonlinear dynamics , ergodicity , and entropy production , have long been at the heart of the foundations of statistical physics .",
    "a central goal of  quantum chaos \" has been to extend this foundation to the quantum world .",
    "classic works on the subject including level statistics @xcite , properties of wigner functions @xcite , and quantum scars in ergodic phase spaces @xcite have tended to focus on the properties of wave mechanics , e.g. the dynamics of single particle billards @xcite ( also seen in the properties of classical waves , e.g. microwave cavities @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , the tensor product structure of quantum mechanics , essential for understanding systems with multiple degrees of freedom , has come to the fore . in that context , one",
    "is naturally led to consider how the dynamical generation of entanglement between quantum subsystems is connected with the chaotic dynamics of coupled classical degrees of freedom .",
    "such studies address fundamental issues of complexity in quantum systems and are potentially applicable in quantum information processing , where entanglement is considered to be an essential resource .",
    "the goal of this article is to revisit this problem and establish a unifying theory that allows us to make quantitative predictions and gives qualitative understanding of the connection between chaos and entanglement .",
    "the connection between chaos in the classical description of hamiltonian dynamics and entanglement in the quantum description has been the subject of extensive study over the last decade .",
    "the original motivation of zurek and paz was to address the quantum - to - classical transition @xcite . by conjecturing that chaotic systems decohere exponentially fast through their entanglement with the environment , they hoped to resolve a paradox in which a macroscopic system would exhibit the effects of quantum coherence on a time scale logarithmic in @xmath0 .",
    "work quickly following this turned to studies of the coupling of just two degrees of freedom , rather than system - environment coupling , as entanglement is most easily quantified for bipartite systems @xcite .",
    "considering two coupled kicked tops ( a standard paradigm of quantum chaos @xcite ) miller and sarkar @xcite correlated the rate of generation of entanglement with the lyapunov exponents associated with the mean positions of quantum wavepackets localized in phase space .    in related research , bandyopadhyay and",
    "lakshminarayan @xcite explored the amount of entanglement that is associated with coupled kicked tops , with particular emphasis on the entanglement of the floquet eigenstates @xcite .",
    "the entanglement of these eigenstates saturated to a value below the maximum possible value in a way that depended only on the hilbert space dimension , not the chaoticity parameter .",
    "the same was was true of the dynamically generated entanglement .",
    "this work gave the first indication that the entanglement generated by the coupled tops was statistical in nature , and related to the theory of random states in hilbert space .",
    "using random matrix theory @xcite they were able to determine the statistics of the schmidt coefficients of a random bipartite pure state , and thus were able to predict the saturation value of the entanglement for the floquet eigenstates .",
    "the relationship between the entanglement in the eigenstates and the dynamically generated entanglement is subtle @xcite ; we ll return to this point later .",
    "ghose and sanders have shown that there are signatures of chaos in the dynamically generated entanglement in a single kicked top when the large angular momentum is thought of as a collection of symmetrically coupled qubits @xcite .",
    "they used the floquet spectrum to explain the initial rise time and power spectrum in the entanglement history .",
    "dynamical generation of entanglement by chaotic maps , and its relation to random unitary matrices was also explored by scott and caves @xcite as a way of comparing different quantizations of the baker s map , and by viola and coworkers as a means of quantifying complexity in quantum systems and its relationship to generalized entanglement @xcite .",
    "while many of the elements connecting chaos and entanglement have been explored with a variety of successful numerical and approximate analytic predictions , there has been no unifying theory , and in some cases , the key relations have been obscured .",
    "the most extensive studies , discussed above , consider coupled systems which are separately chaotic ( kicked tops ) rather than being chaotic due their coupling .",
    "this can muddy the waters .",
    "for example , it was shown that the strength of chaos did not enhance the production rate of entanglement for weakly chaotic coupled tops @xcite , while bandyopadhyay and lakshminarayan @xcite showed that the relationship between entanglement and the chaoticity parameter varied with the coupling strength between the tops .",
    "as we seek to connect chaos and entanglement , it is most natural to consider systems in which they arise from the _ same mechanism _  their physical coupling .",
    "moreover , by considering a system that is chaotic only when the two parts are coupled , the classical phase space describes the global system rather than a subsystem , and there is no ambiguity about the nature of the dynamics .",
    "the distinction between weak and strong coupling can not be made independent of strong and weak chaos , thereby sharpening our focus on the key relationships .    to address these issues ,",
    "we consider a model system of kicked coupled - tops , rather then coupled kicked - tops , described in detail in sec .",
    "this system is motivated by its connection to possible experimental realizations , our ability to easily visualize the classical phases space , and to analyze the floquet map .",
    "we use this system as the forum to explore the basic thesis of this paper .",
    "chaos arises in classical dynamics because of insufficient symmetry ( integrals of motion ) for a given number of degrees of freedom . in the quantum analog",
    ", insufficient symmetry leads to the random matrix conjecture ",
    "systems with global classical chaos have eigenvectors and eigenvalues that are statistically predicted by ensembles of random matrices @xcite .",
    "moreover , whereas global chaos leads to ergodic dynamics and the generation of  random \" coarse - grained distributions on phase space , a large body of numerical studies indicate that the quantum chaotic map is ergodic in the sense that it generates a state with many properties that are statistically predicted by a random state in hilbert space , picked according to appropriate haar measure @xcite .",
    "the dynamically generated entanglement is then that of a random state ( by this measure ) in the relevant hilbert state .",
    "these predictions can be extended to mixed phase spaces with regular islands immersed in a chaotic sea . with the help of percival s conjecture @xcite that divides eigenstates into chaotic and regular classes , ergodicity on the chaotic sea leads to random states in a chaotic subspace and a commensurate typical entanglement .",
    "whereas in the globally chaotic case we can derive analytic results , for the mixed phase spaces we are relegated to numerical predictions , which nonetheless verify the ergodic conjecture , connecting entanglement generation in chaotic dynamics to the creation of pseudo - random states in hilbert space .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce our model of kicked coupled - tops , studying the classical and quantum features .",
    "section iii , the heart of paper , studies the entanglement in our system .",
    "we perform numerical calculations of the entanglement of the system s eigenstates , the long - time averaged entanglement generated by the floquet map , and its relationship to the classical phase space .",
    "we then explain these results in terms of the properties of random states in hilbert space . reviewing the essential ideas ,",
    "we derive new analytic expressions for the typical entanglement of a random state when we are restricted to a subspace of the full tensor product space .",
    "this is of relevance here given the symmetries of the system .",
    "we also pay particular attention to the subtle distinctions between the eigenstates of random matrices and the random states generated from initially localized wavepackets .",
    "in doing so we clarify previous works and make accurate predictions , especially for global chaos , but also extended to a more general mixed phase space scenario .",
    "our results are discussed and summarized in sec .",
    "we consider a bipartite system composed of two spins , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , isotropically coupled in a heisenberg interaction , and subject to periodic kicks that act only on spin @xmath2 . choosing the direction of the kicks to be about the @xmath3-axis , the system evolves according to the hamiltonian , @xmath4 here @xmath5 gives the strength of the isotropic coupling , @xmath6 the strength of the kicking , and @xmath7 is the kicking period .",
    "such a hamiltonian describes the hyperfine interaction between nuclear spin @xmath1 and total electron angular momentum @xmath2 , with a magnetic field that has negligible effect on the nucleus . while this realization can not reach deep into the semiclassical regime , for large atoms , with heavy nuclei and a large number of electrons in the valance shell",
    ", one can explore nontrival mesoscopic regimes .",
    "the true semiclassical limit can potentially be attained in an atom - photon system where @xmath1 is the collective spin of an atomic ensemble coupled to the stokes vector @xmath2 of a quantized electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "we will not consider here the feasibility of experimental realizations , instead focusing on the foundational theory .",
    "choosing the external field to act in delta kicks allows us to express the floquet map ( transformation after one period ) in a simple form of sequential rotations , @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are related to @xmath5 and @xmath6 in terms of the kicking period , @xmath0 , etc . in the second form",
    ", we have expressed the rotation in terms of the total angular momentum @xmath11 and neglected irrelevant overall phases .",
    "we can thus interpret the dynamics as alternating a rotation of @xmath2 about a space fixed @xmath3-axis by angle @xmath10 , followed by a procession of @xmath1 and @xmath2 about @xmath12 by an angle @xmath13 , as shown in fig ( [ f1 ] ) .",
    "such a simple transformation nonetheless leads to complex dynamics , including chaos in the classical limit as discussed below . from the quantum perspective , since the two rotations do nt commute , there are insufficient symmetries to specify floquet eigenstates by a complete set of commuting operators ; the system is not integrable .",

    "we treat the classical limit of quantum mechanical spin in the familiar way @xcite .",
    "each of our spins has three components , but a fixed magnitude , and thus their orientations can be specified by two variables .",
    "the @xmath3-component of a spin and the angle @xmath16 , denoting its orientation in the @xmath17 plane , are canonically conjugate , and thus each spin constitutes one canonical degree of freedom .",

    "since @xmath14 is conserved , the dynamics is restricted to a four - dimensional hypersurface .",

    "next we consider the dynamically generated entanglement , starting from a spin coherent product state projected into the @xmath24 subpace .",
    "the key conjecture , seen numerically in prior studies , is that chaotic maps acting on a fiducial state generate states with the statistics of random states in hilbert space , chosen according to the appropriate ensemble .",

    "clearly , this value of entanglement is a statistical property of hilbert space . just as the quantum dynamics lead to a random state in the entire @xmath24 subspace when the classical dynamics are globally chaotic , for a classically mixed phase space , based on percival s conjecture , the quantum dynamics generate a random state in the",
    "_ chaotic subspace_. the structure of the chaotic sea can not be described by a simple symmetry , so we can not determine the entanglement of a typical state analytically .",
    "however , we can filter the eigenstates to determine which are in the chaotic subspace , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] , and sample randomly from a unitarily invariant measure over this subspace in order to find the typical entanglement value . in this case",
    "there is no simple expression for the entanglement as a function of the states , so we can not analytically take the average over the appropriate measure as before .",
    "instead , we generate a large number of random states in the chaotic subspace , and find their entanglements .",
    "we do this by picking the real and imaginary parts of the expansion coefficients with respect to the chaotic eigenstates according to a gaussian distribution . after normalizing ,",
    "the entanglement is calculated for this state , and the process is repeated 100 times .",
    "the results are averaged to find an estimate of the average entanglement of a random state in the chaotic sea .",
    "we find that the average entanglement of a random state in the chaotic subspace picked according to the ue distribution is 5.13 , in good agreement with the numerically determined value of @xmath93 found in sec .",
    "part of this discrepancy is likely due to the greater degree of variation of entanglement across the chaotic sea in the mixed phase space compared to the relatively flat completely chaotic phase space .",
    "in addition our filter for determining the members of the chaotic subspace was somewhat crude with an ambiguous  grey zone \" .",
    "we would expect this to improve deeper in the semiclassical regime , where percival s conjecture applies better .",
    "classical chaotic dynamics lead to ergodic mixing in phase space .",
    "quantum analogs of ergodicity have long been considered , including  spectral chaos \" @xcite and increase in entropy associated with the wave function when expanded in a fixed ( non - stationary - state ) basis @xcite .",
    "recent numerical studies indicate that quantum dynamics generated by nonintegrable hamiltonians are ergodic in the sense that they generate pseudo - random states in a hilbert space , chosen according to a haar measure that is dictated by the symmetries of the system @xcite .",
    "such a result is not new , having its roots in the random matrix theory conjecture of quantum chaos @xcite  the typical hamiltonian of a nonintegrable system has the statistical properties of random matrices of an ensemble picked according to the symmetries of the system under time reversal .",
    "the classic works on the subject , however , focus on the properties of the stationary states and spectra ",
    "berry s  quantum chaology \" @xcite .",
    "dynamical ergodicity in quantum mechanics has been harder to pin down and is still a subject of some controversy .",
    "the existence of quantum dynamical ergodicity has implications for the dynamical generation of entanglement .",
    "it is well known that for large dimensional bipartite hilbert spaces , a random state is highly entangled with almost the maximum entanglement allowed by the dimension @xcite .",
    "as the large dimensional limit is equivalent to the @xmath136 semiclassical limit , and to the degree that the quantum analogs of chaotic hamiltonians generate random states , one expects near maximal dynamical generation of entanglement in quantum chaos , to a value that is predicted by the statistics at hand .",
    "this is not to say that regular dynamics ( quantum analogs of integrable motion ) can not lead to highly entangled states .",
    "indeed , such behavior is seen , and has been previously noted in @xcite .",
    "regular dynamics , however , show oscillatory behavior , including in the generation of entanglement .",
    "chaotic dynamics , by contrast , lead to quasi - steady state behavior , and typically lead to higher values of time - averaged entanglement than regular motion . taken together ,",
    "these facts imply that the long - time average entanglement in a bipartite system should be a strong signature of classical chaos , closely associated with ergodicity in the two dynamical descriptions .",
    "we have studied the relationship between entanglement and chaos for a system of isotropically coupled tops , in which one of the tops receives a periodic kick around a fixed axis .",
    "in contrast to most previous studies , here the chaos and entanglement arise from the same coupling mechanism .",
    "this allows us to remove ambiguities that have been discussed regarding the effect of coupling between the subsystems vs. the chaoticity in the individual subsystems .",
    "moreover , the rotational symmetry of the system allows us to easily calculate and interpret the entanglement because the schmidt basis , within a subspace defined by a fixed value of the conserved angular momentum , is independent of the joint state of the system .",
    "this unique property connects entanglement in our system to the entropy of the probability distribution of a random state with respect to a fixed basis .",
    "the results reported here give further confirmation to the fact that chaotic systems take quantum initial conditions to pseudo - random quantum states , and that the high long - time entanglement average of states undergoing quantum chaotic dynamics is just that of a typical state in the hilbert space .",
    "we see the confirmation of this picture in the excellent agreement between the properties of ensembles of quantum states and the numerical results for the eigenvector statistics and long - time entanglement average for the completely chaotic system .",
    "this approach was also found to be highly flexible , applying to subspaces and mixed phase spaces .    for parameters with global chaos ,",
    "independent of the initial condition , the dynamically generated entanglement is well - predicted by a random state of the appropriate haar - averaged unitary ensemble .",
    "this value is distinct from the expected value of entanglement in the orthogonal ensemble that describes the floquet eigenstates for this time - reversal invariant system .",
    "dynamical evolution changes the measure over which we must average , even though the floquet operator itself is a member of the coe , and even when the initial state itself is an eigenstate of time reversal .",
    "we are able to derive exact analytic results for these expected values when the state is restricted to a subspace dictated by the symmetries .    for a mixed phase space , numerical plots of the long - time entanglement average entanglement exhibit beautiful correlation with the regular islands and the chaotic sea . within the chaotic sea ,",
    "the entanglement is fairly uniform , with a value characteristic of the ergodic mixing .",
    "we show this by appealing to percival s conjecture . in the semiclassical limit",
    ", the hilbert space approximately decomposes into subspaces spanned by the eigenstates that condense on the regular islands and those that are spread through the chaotic sea .",
    "we determine the chaotic subspace by filtering the floquet eigenstates according to their entropy in phase space and by the expected values of observables associated with the regular islands . given an identification of the chaotic subspace , we performed a haar measure average of the expected entanglement and found reasonable agreement with the dynamically generated value for states initially localized in the chaotic sea .",
    "there is still some deviation between our predictions and the numerical results , but we believe that the basic reasoning behind this method is sound . for systems in",
    "which symmetry more cleanly separates the chaotic and regular subspaces @xcite , we expect that the haar measure average over the unitary group will give a very accurate prediction of the entanglement generation in the chaotic sea for mixed phase spaces .",
