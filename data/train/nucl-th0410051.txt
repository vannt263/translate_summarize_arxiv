    "during the last two decades calculations of nucleon - deuteron scattering experienced large improvements and refinements . here",
    "different techniques have been applied , faddeev calculations in configuration space @xcite and momentum space @xcite , and variational calculations based on a hyperspherical harmonic expansion @xcite .",
    "it is fair to say that below about 200  mev projectile energy the momentum space faddeev equations for three - nucleon scattering can now be solved with high accuracy for the most modern two- and three - nucleon forces .",
    "a summary for these achievements can be found in ref .",
    "the approach described there is based on using angular momentum eigenstates for the two- and three - body systems .",
    "this partial wave decomposition replaces the continuous angle variables by discrete orbital angular momentum quantum numbers , and thus reduces the number of continuous variables to be discretized in a numerical treatment . for low projectile energies the procedure of considering orbital angular momentum components appears physically justified due to arguments related to the centrifugal barrier and the short range of the nuclear force .",
    "however , the algebraic and algorithmic steps to be carried out in a partial wave decomposition can be quite involved when solving the faddeev equations .",
    "if one considers three - nucleon scattering at a few hundred mev projectile energy , the number of partial waves needed to achieve convergence proliferates , and limitations with respect to computational feasibility and accuracy are reached .",
    "it appears therefore natural to avoid a partial wave representation completely and work directly with vector variables .",
    "this is common practice in bound state calculations of few - nucleon systems based on variational @xcite and green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) methods @xcite , which are carried out in configuration space .",
    "our aim is to work directly with vector variables in the faddeev scheme in momentum space . in earlier work @xcite",
    "we showed that the bound state faddeev equation has a rather transparent structure when formulated with vector variables compared to the coupled set of two - dimensional integral equations obtained in a partial wave decomposed form .",
    "based on malfliet - tjon type interactions for two- as well as three - body forces , it was demonstrated that the numerical solution of the bound state equation using vector variables is straightforward and numerically very accurate .",
    "as far as three nucleon scattering is concerned , the neutron - deuteron break - up process has been successfully studied up to 500 mev projectile energy based on the first order term of the faddeev equation using realistic nucleon - nucleon forces @xcite .    in this article",
    "we want to show that the full solution of the three - body scattering equation can be obtained in a straightforward manner when employing vector variables , i.e. magnitudes of momenta and angles between the momentum vectors . as a simplification we neglect spin and iso - spin degrees of freedom and treat three - boson scattering .",
    "the interactions employed are of yukawa type , and no separable approximations are involved .",
    "the faddeev equation for three identical bosons is solved exactly as function of momentum vectors below and above the three - body break - up .",
    "this article is organized as follows . section ii reviews the faddeev equation for three - body scattering in momentum space and discusses our choice of momentum and angle variables for the unknown amplitude in the equation and its kernel . in section",
    "iii we derive the amplitudes and cross sections for elastic scattering and break - up processes .",
    "in addition we relate both via the optical theorem . in section",
    "iv we discuss the numerical methods necessary for solving the faddeev equation , especially our treatment of the singularities in the free three - body propagator .",
    "in addition , our numerical tests for the solution are shown and discussed . in section",
    "v we present calculations for elastic scattering and break - up processes in the intermediate energy regime from 0.2 to 1  gev .",
    "our focus here is on the study of the importance of rescattering terms as function of the projectile energy and the reaction considered .",
    "we conclude in section vi .",
    "various presentations of three - body scattering in the faddeev scheme are presented in the literature @xcite .",
    "we solve the faddeev equation for three identical particles in the form @xmath2 the driving term of this integral equation consists of the two - body t - matrix @xmath3 , the sum @xmath4 of a cyclic and anticyclic permutation of three particles , and the initial state @xmath5 , composed of a two - body bound state and the momentum eigenstate of the projectile particle .",
    "the kernel of of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.1 ] ) contains the free three - body propagator , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the total energy in the center of mass frame .",
    "the operator @xmath8 determines both , the full break - up amplitude @xmath9 and the amplitude for elastic scattering @xmath10 in this paper we focus on three identical bosons and use a momentum space representation . for solving eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.1 ] ) , we introduce standard jacobi momenta * p * , the relative momentum in the subsystem , and * q * , the relative momentum of the spectator to the subsystem .",
    "the momentum states are normalized according to @xmath11 .",
    "projecting eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.1 ] ) on to jacobi momenta leads to @xcite @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the symmetrized @xmath3 matrix and @xmath7 is the total energy in the center of mass ( c.m . ) system @xmath14 we assume that the underlying force is a two - body force , generating @xmath3 via a two - body lippmann - schwinger equation and supporting one bound state with energy @xmath15 .",
    "thus , @xmath16 has a pole at @xmath17 . since the transition operator @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.4 ] ) is needed for all values of * q * , one encounters this pole of @xmath18 . extracting the residue explicitly by defining @xmath19 and similarly for @xmath8 , eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.4 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath20 this expression is the starting point for our numerical calculation of the transition amplitude without employing an angular momentum decomposition .",
    "the first important step for an explicit calculation is the selection of independent variables .",
    "since we ignore spin and iso - spin dependencies , the matrix element @xmath21 is a scalar function of the variables @xmath22 and @xmath23 for a given projectile momentum @xmath24 .",
    "thus one needs 5 variables to uniquely specify the geometry of the three vectors @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "having in mind that with three vectors one can span 2 planes , i.e. the @xmath22-@xmath24-plane and the @xmath23-@xmath24-plane , a natural choice of independent variables is @xmath25 the last variable , @xmath26 , is the angle between the two normal vectors of the @xmath22-@xmath24-plane and the @xmath23-@xmath24-plane , which are explicitly given by @xmath27 it should be pointed out , that the angle between the vectors @xmath23 and @xmath22 , @xmath28 , is * not * an independent variable .",

    "( [ faddeev - hat - t ] ) it is mandatory to choose the coordinate system for the * q*-integration such that the z - axis points parallel to the vector @xmath48 .",

    "( [ eq:2.16 ] ) @xmath49 where @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the azimuthal angle of @xmath52 in the coordinate system chosen for the * q*-integration .",

    "for the explicit calculation we can make different choices of the z - axis , e.g. it can be parallel to the direction @xmath91 of the projectile , or parallel to either one of the jacobi vectors @xmath48 and @xmath58 .",

    "since the momentum region which contributes to a solution of the two - body @xmath3-matrix is quite different from the region of importance in a three - body calculation , we map our solution for @xmath161 onto the momentum grid relevant for the three - body transition amplitude .",

    "( [ eq:2.19 ] ) .",
    "in carrying out our calculations , it turns out that there are essentially two separate issues governing the quality of the results .",
    "the first is the angle dependence of the transition amplitude of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.19 ] ) .",
    "it is to be expected that the angle dependence is weak at low energies and increases with higher energies , reflecting the need to include more and more partial waves at higher energies in a partial wave based calculations .",
    "as example we list in table  [ table-2 ] the elastic and break - up total cross sections together with the total cross section extracted from the imaginary part of @xmath71 in forward direction , eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.22 ] ) . at 0.01",
    "gev 12 points for all angles are clearly sufficient , whereas at 0.1  gev this is not so .",
    "table  [ table-2 ] lists the elastic , break - up and total cross section as function of the angle variables , and we see that one needs at least 16 points for all angles . at 0.5  gev",
    "we find that the biggest angular dependence occurs in @xmath30 and @xmath164 , and the least dependence in the azimuthal angle @xmath165 and the angle @xmath64 , and take this into account in our choice of angle points .",
    "the other issue is the quality of the calculation in the singular regime , i.e. in the integration region bounded by @xmath166 in fig .",
    "we divide the integration grid for @xmath167 into the intervals @xmath168 , where @xmath169 and @xmath17020  @xmath171 .",
    "the inteval boundaries @xmath172 and @xmath166 are handled explicitly .",
    "as the energy increases , @xmath166 increases , and we need to take this into account by changing the distribution of the @xmath167 points as function of energy within the different @xmath107-intervals , i.e. put more points into the interval @xmath173 and less into @xmath174 . from the number of points in @xmath173",
    "one can define an average point distance @xmath175 in this interval . in fig .",

    "it is quite easy to make the average point distance very small in the interval @xmath173 , since @xmath166 is only 75  mev .",
    "the top panel of fig .  [ fig3a ] shows that the percent error @xmath178 drops linearly below 0.1% and flattens out at @xmath176= 3.5  mev where most likely errors in the interpolation start to play a role . at projectile energy 0.1",
    "gev @xmath166 is already 284  mev , and @xmath176 is naturally much larger with a reasonable number of @xmath107 points .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath178 for 0.1  gev on @xmath176 is shown in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] for two different cases .",
    "an angular grid size of 12 points is indicated by the open squares , one of 24 points by crosses .",
    "a comparison of the calculations shows at @xmath176 = 15  mev the calculation with 12 angular points can not be improved any further , the calculations start to oscillate for smaller @xmath176 , accidentally giving a very good agreement at @xmath176 = 13  mev . increasing the number of angle points to 24 shows a further linear decrease in the error ( cross symbols ) into the 1% region of @xmath178 at a @xmath176 = 9  mev .",
    "this is consistent with the findings shown in the top panel .",
    "we continue to study the dependence of @xmath176 at 0.5  gev , where @xmath166 = 644  mev . here",
    "we immediately use 24 angle points as suggested from table  [ table-2 ] .",
    "a total of 30 integration points in @xmath173 leads to @xmath176 = 22  mev and @xmath179 10% , which is consistent with values in the middle panel .",
    "the 10% error is also consistent with the value for the total break - up cross section in the last row of table  [ table-2 ] , which indicates that @xmath180 is not yet converged . from the systematics at the different energies shown in fig .",

    "the calculations are based on the largest grids given in table  [ table-2 ] and show a very good agreement of the results obtained in the different coordinate systems .",

    "both amplitudes should be identical within our numerical errors .",
    "this is checked by evaluating the cross sections again using the second amplitude .",
    "we document the results in table  [ table-4 ] for the differential elastic cross section at selected angles .",

    "through we neglect spin and iso - spin degrees of freedom and stay in a strictly nonrelativistic framework , we nevertheless can provide first qualitative insights for various cross sections in three - body scattering in the intermediate energy regime which we define from 200  mev to 1  gev projectile energy",
    ". the focus of our investigations will be the question which orders of rescattering in the two - body @xmath3-matrix are needed to come close to the exact result , namely the solution of the faddeev equation .    as a model two - body interaction",
    "we choose a superposition of two yukawa interactions of malfliet - tjon type @xcite @xmath189 the parameters are given in table  [ table-7 ] , and fitted such that the potential supports a two - body bound state , the ` deuteron ' , at -2.23  mev . as first result we show in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the total cross section together with the total elastic and total break - up cross section as function of the laboratory projectile energy . in addition , the total cross section is also evaluated via the optical theorem as a test of our numerics .",
    "this duplicates the information already given in table  iii .",
    "we see that the optical theorem is quite well fulfilled .",
    "the figure shows that at roughly 1  gev the total elastic and total break - up cross section become equal in magnitude in our model .",
    "next we show in fig .",
    "4 the angular distribution in elastic scattering for a set of selected energies .",
    "in addition to the exact faddeev result , the cross sections are evaluated in first order in the two - body @xmath3-matrix , second order in @xmath3 , third order in @xmath3 , and 4th order in @xmath3 , and displayed .",
    "first we notice that with increasing energy the cross section in forward direction decreases .",
    "furthermore , for all energies shown , the first rescattering ( 2nd order in @xmath3 ) always increases the cross section , and subsequent rescatterings lower it again .",
    "as expected , for the lowest energy , 0.2  gev , rescattering terms of higher order are important , and even the 4th order is not yet close to the full result .",
    "the same is true for 0.8  gev .",
    "we notice , that even at 1  gev two rescattering terms ( 3rd order in @xmath3 ) are necessary to come into the vicinity of the final result .",
    "the same is true for 0.5  gev .    in view of the standard ` @xmath3-@xmath190 ' impulse approximation for the optical potential in nucleon - nucleus scattering employed at intermediate energies@xcite , it is interesting to notice that the first order result in @xmath3 in our model study is quite insufficient . even at energies larger than 0.5  gev",
    "rescattering corrections up to the 3rd order are required to come close to the exact result for small scattering angles .",
    "therefore it seems to be likely that the first order impulse approximation in nucleon - nucleus scattering is insufficient .    in case of inelastic processes",
    "we first regard the semi - exclusive reaction d(n , n@xmath1 ) where only one nucleon is detected .",
    "we choose three different laboratory energies , 200  mev , 500  mev , and 1  gev and show the inclusive cross section as a few selected angles for the detected nucleon .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] through [ fig9 ] .    at 0.2",
    "gev the semi - exclusive cross section is given in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for the emission angle 24@xmath191 and in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] for the emission angle 39@xmath191 .",
    "both figures show in the upper panel the entire energy range of the emitted particle .",
    "since the cross section varies by two orders of magnitude , we display it in a logarithmic scale . in order to better flash out the peak structures ,",
    "the two lower panels show the high and low energies of the emitted particle in a linear scale . together with the full solution of the faddeev equation ( solid line ) we display the sums of the lowest orders of the multiple scattering series as indicated in the figure .",
    "the peak at the highest energy of the emitted particle is the socalled final state interaction ( fsi ) peak , which only develops when rescattering terms are taken into account .",
    "this peak is a general feature of semi - exclusive scattering and is present for all energies .",
    "the next peak is the quasi - free ( qfs ) peak , and one sees that at both angles one needs at least rescattering of 4th order to come close to the full result .",
    "however , in contrast to the smaller angle , at the larger angle , 39@xmath191 in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the first order result for the larger energies is surprisingly close to the full solution , though the multiple scattering series is by no means converged , as the following higher orders indicate .",
    "we also observe that the qfs peak moves to lower energies of the emitted particle with increasing emission angle . at both angles the very low energies of the emitted particle exhibit a strong peak in first order , which is considerably lowered by the first rescattering . here",
    "the calculation up to 3rd order in the multiple scattering series seems already sufficient .    for 0.5  gev incident energy",
    "the semi - exclusive cross section is given in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] for the emission angle 24@xmath191 and in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] for the emission angle 36@xmath191 .",
    "we again see three peaks along along the energy axis of the detected nucleon , the fsi and qfs peaks as well as the peak at the extreme low energy of the emitted particle .",
    "again we see that the results based on first and second order in @xmath3 alone are quite insufficient and higher order rescatterings can not be neglected .",
    "it is also interesting to observe that at 24@xmath191 , fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , the third and higher order rescattering terms shift the peak to higher energies , whereas at the larger angle of 36@xmath191 the peak positions of the various orders coincide more or less and agree with the peak position of the full calculation . again , for the peak for the very low energies of the emitted particle , the 3rd order calculation agrees already quite well with the full result .    at 1",
    "gev the situation is similar .",
    "as examples we have selected two angles , 18@xmath191 displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] and 30@xmath191 displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] . for the small emission angle the second rescattering shifts the qfs peak towards higher energies , at the larger angle",
    "this is not the case .",
    "our studies indicate that this is a general phenomemon occurring at all energies under consideration .",
    "there exists a critical maximum energy @xmath192 of the emitted particle , corresponding to a specific emission angle , at which such a shift in the qfs peak through higher order rescattering terms can occur . at 0.5  gev projectile energy",
    "this maximum energy is 0.44  gev , at 1  gev it is 0.88  gev .",
    "if one considers the ratio @xmath193 , then one finds for both cases that if this ratio is larger than 0.8 , the qsf peak is shifted by higher order rescattering terms .",
    "this could be interpreted as an interference between the qfs and the fsi mechanisms .",
    "if this ratio is smaller than 0.8 , then the fsi peak is small and higher orders in the multiple scattering series do not change the position of the qfs peak .",
    "in addition , it seems that at the larger angle ( fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) the multiple scattering series converges a little faster with respect to the higher orders compared to the smaller angle ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) . the final result for",
    "the peak at the very low energy of the emitted particle is as before reached with two rescattering contributions .",
    "it is remarkable that for the energies between about 200 and 500  mev of the emitted particle the first rescattering contributes almost an order of magnitude to the cross section .",
    "we can make a first contact to calculations based on realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) forces . in ref .",
    "@xcite the semi - exclusive process @xmath194 has been determined in first order in @xmath3 based on the nn potentials av18 @xcite and bonn - b @xcite . in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] we compare our first order calculation at projectile laboratory energy 495  mev and 18@xmath191 emission angle with the first order calculations from ref .",
    "@xcite based on the two realistic potentials .",
    "the position of the peak is only determined through kinematics , thus the peak position coincides for all three calculations .",
    "though our model calculation refers to bosons and the potential contains only the crude features of a central short range repulsion and intermediate range attraction , the magnitudes of the cross sections differ only by roughly 20% . in the lower panel",
    "we show the contributions of the first orders of the multiple scattering series successively summed together with the exact solution of the faddeev equation for our model . at this angle and energy the contribution of the first rescattering ( 2nd - order in the multiple scattering series )",
    "is quite weak , the contributions of the next two orders are large and lower the size of the peak . at the very high energies of the emitted particle , the 4th order in the multiple scattering series is still not yet close to the exact result .",
    "therefore we conjecture that at this energy calculations with realistic forces will also require higher order rescattering contributions .",
    "finally we comment on a recently measured and analyzed reaction @xmath195 at high momentum transfer @xcite . in this experiment",
    "the break - up configuration has been chosen such that the neutron is ejected at extreme backward angles , and the two protons at extreme forward angles .",
    "the measurement was carried out at gev laboratory energies .",
    "the experimental data @xcite have been analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite using first and second order processes in the nn @xmath3-matrix including a @xmath196-isobar mechanism . within our nonrelativistic toy model for three bosons we are of course unable to analyze the data .",
    "however , within our model we can give a clear answer whether higher order rescattering processes are essential in this reaction .",
    "in @xcite the data are integrated over a small interval of the relative @xmath197 energy between 0 and 3  mev , and averaged over the neutron c.m .",
    "angle in the interval between 172@xmath191 and 180@xmath191 . in our qualitative study",
    "we fix the c.m .",
    "angle of one particle at 180@xmath191 , but integrate over the relative energy @xmath198 of the two other particles between 0 and 3  mev .",
    "thus , we evaluate the cross section @xmath199 since we choose the z - axis parallel to @xmath52 , and @xmath82 is antiparallel to @xmath52 , the @xmath57 dependence is directly given by @xmath200 .",
    "our calculations are carried out for projectile laboratory energies between 0.2 and 1  gev , and are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "here we compare different low orders in the two - body @xmath3-matrix with the full solution of the faddeev equation .",
    "we notice that all our calculations exhibit a smooth fall - off as function of the projectile energy .",
    "this behavior is present in the data of ref .",
    "none of our calculations shows a dip structure around 0.7  gev as indicated for some of the calculations in ref .",
    "the reason may be that our calculation is carried out in three dimension , i.e. all partial waves are included exactly , where as in ref .",
    "@xcite only the lowest partial waves are considered . at low projectile energies rescattering",
    "terms of higher order still give considerable contributions to the cross section . at 1",
    "gev the first order calculation is an order of magnitude smaller than the result of the full calculation .",
    "it is interesting to notice that at 1  gev the contribution from the first rescattering is relatively small , and one needs to go to the 3rd order in @xmath3 to come close to the full result for this particular break - up configuration .",
    "in addition to the specific break - up configuration described above , a measurement of the extreme backward scattering elastic @xmath201 cross section has been investigated in @xcite . instead of a forward scattered @xmath197 pair with very small relative energy ,",
    "one now has a forward going deuteron .",
    "this situation corresponds to elastic scattering from a deuteron at backward angle . to investigate the influence of rescattering for this reaction we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] the backward angle of the elastic cross section at energies from 0.2 to 1  gev , and compare the result of the full faddeev calculation with calculations based on low orders in the multiple scattering series .",
    "the figure shows that the first order calculation is insufficient over the entire energy regime considered , except of course for the crossing point around 0.5  gev .",
    "the first rescattering contribution ( 2nd order calculation ) , though close at 0.2  gev , is insufficient below roughly 0.9  gev .",
    "the figure also shows that at about 0.9  gev the relative magnitude of contributions from the second and higher rescattering become small .",
    "thus , we conclude that at 1  gev one needs at least one rescattering to be in the vicinity of the full result for the elastic cross section at the backward angle .",
    "in this study we perform fully converged faddeev calculations for three identical bosons interacting by non - separable forces in the intermediate energy range between about 0.2 and 1.0 gev . to the best of our knowledge",
    "these are the first calculations of this kind .",
    "the key point is to neglect the partial wave decomposition generally used at low energies and to work directly with momentum vectors .",
    "thus all partial waves are exactly included .",
    "important is the suitable choice of variables . besides the two magnitudes of the two relative jacobi momenta @xmath202 and @xmath188 we choose the angles between the vectors @xmath202 and @xmath187 and between @xmath188 and @xmath187 , where @xmath187 is the projectile momentum .",
    "the fifth variable is the angle between the two planes spanned by @xmath202 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 , @xmath187 . in the technical piece of the work we introduce for the first time a spline based integration of the moving logarithmic singularities , which is a very valuable alternative to procedures used so far .",
    "the numerical results are converging as documented in section iii . in section v we show elastic and inelastic ( break - up ) cross sections in the above mentioned intermediate energy range .",
    "we focus on the question how many orders of rescattering beyond the often used first order calculation in the two - body @xmath3-matrix are needed to come close to the full faddeev result .",
    "we find that in nearly all cases studied processes of at least 2nd and 3rd order rescattering are required . whether this will be also required in performing calculations with realistic dynamical inputs has to be seen in the future .",
    "in one case we can make first contact to a result based on the nn forces av18 and bonn b , which are considered to be realistic in the sense that they describe all nn data below 350 mev extremely well .",
    "this was the semi - exclusive cross section at 495 mev evaluated in first order in the nn t - matrix .",
    "of course , at that energy av18 and bonn - b are at the upper limit of their applicability . despite our simple two - body model force , a superposition of two yukawa interactions , one attractive the other repulsive , our results turns out to be within about 20% to the calculation based on the realistic models .",
    "this shows that our investigations might allow some conclusions about results based on present and future models with more dynamical inputs .    as a first example for considering data in the light of our toy model we study the extreme backward elastic dn scattering over the energy range from 0.2 to 1.0 gev .",
    "we find that first order results in the two - body @xmath3-matrix are totally insufficient and only around 1 gev the first order rescattering comes close to the full result .",
    "parallel to those data in elastic scattering in @xcite the complete break up process d(p , n)pp has also been investigated . here",
    "the neutron was ejected antiparallel to the beam direction and the two protons at extreme forward angles with a very small relative energy .",
    "again we study the significance of rescattering processes , and find that for this particular break - up configuration two rescatterings are necessary to get close to the result of the full faddeev calculation .",
    "in conclusion we can say that the three - body faddeev equations can be safely solved at intermediate energies using directly momentum vectors .",
    "calculations based on partial wave decomposition would be hardly feasible at these energies .",
    "further studies scanning the complete three - body phase space for the total break - up are underway .",
    "this may be important in order to shed light on previous theoretical analysis of p(d , ppn ) reactions which relied on low order reaction mechanisms .",
    "based on our current experience it appears that if low order rescattering processes will turn out to be sufficient for certain phase space regions , realistic calculations including spin and isospin will be feasible , even including three - body forces .",
    "a first step evaluating the d(p , n)pp break - up cross section in first order with a currently used two - pion exchange three - nucleon force model is already under way @xcite .",
    "what is badly needed now are realistic models for nuclear forces in the intermediate energy regime we study .",
    "this paper allows us to conclude that it will be feasible to extend the calculations to realistic dynamics .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the effect of relativistic kinematics was studied in the ( p , n ) charge exchange reaction on deuterium between 0.1 and 0.5  gev in a first order faddeev calculation .",
    "this work concluded that the effects due to relativistic kinematics are quite visible at 0.5  gev , specifically in the location of the position of the qfs peak , which is purely determined by kinematics .",
    "therefore , we should expect that the relativistic kinematics will influence our results , especially at energies larger than 0.5  gev .",
    "of course , there are other dynamical relativistic effects . for energies below @xmath2030.25  gev those relativistic effects",
    "were studied in neutron - deuteron elastic scattering in ref .",
    "there it was found that the combination of relativistic effects consistently incorporated is negligible below 0.1  gev , and manifests itself at 0.25  gev mostly at large scattering angles .",
