    "the cmb is one of the primary experimental windows to the early universe .",
    "recent observations have reached remarkable precision .",
    "when combined with other complementary cosmological datasets , the wmap three year ( hereafter , wmap3 ) observations @xcite convincingly support the so - called standard model of structure formation  @xcite .",
    "however the cmb may provide further information . in principle , one may use the background photons to constrain new physics beyond `` standard '' models .",
    "a positive answer might be provided by the study of cmb polarization ( cmbp ) , whose observations currently mark the experimental frontier of the field . pioneering observations , including dasi @xcite , cbi @xcite , boomerang 2003 @xcite ( hereafter b03 ) , maxipol @xcite , and wmap itself @xcite have yielded detections of the cmbp over a wide range of angular scales . within the next decade , ground or space - based experiments may detect via the cmbp a signal from primordial gravitational waves @xcite , thus constraining the energy scale of the inflation and probing particle physics well beyond the capability of any conceivable terrestrial accelerator .",
    "the cmbp can also provide information on symmetry - violating physics beyond the lee - yang parity ( @xmath4 ) breaking that is central to the standard model , yet not observable through cmb anisotropies due to their charge blind character .",
    "in general , the breakdown of spacetime symmetries is a potential tracer of new physics @xcite .",
    "several models exist that predict non - standard @xmath4 and @xmath5 violations ( @xmath6 standing for charge conjugation ) , as well as @xmath0 violations ( @xmath7 being time reversal ) and the related ( through the anti-@xmath0 theorem @xcite ) breakdown of lorentz invariance .",
    "a number of tests have been suggested and ( in many cases ) performed , either in terrestrial and orbital laboratories @xcite or through cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "these violations might also have a measurable imprint on the observed cmbp pattern , whose statistical properties are constrained by the assumption of symmetry conservation .    for a sky direction @xmath8 , a polarized map of the cmb",
    "is usually given in terms of total intensity ( or temperature ) @xmath9 and linear polarization stokes parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    ". the @xmath12 field can be decomposed into scalar ( s ) spherical harmonics @xmath13 , obtaining the coefficients @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 are components of a symmetric , trace - free rank 2 tensor , and are expanded in tensor spherical harmonics @xmath17 and @xmath18 with coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "these correspond to scalar ( gradient - like ) @xmath21 and pseudo - scalar ( curl - like ) @xmath22 modes @xcite . under hypothesis of gaussianity and isotropy , the statistical properties the cmb",
    "are described by two point correlation functions on the sphere , whose legendre transforms define six angular power spectra : @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "if the physics controlling cmb fluctuations is parity conserving the cross spectra @xmath25 and @xmath26 must vanish due to the different handedness of the c and ( s , g ) harmonics .",
    "therefore , if the standard cosmological model holds , we should expect no relevant information from @xmath27 and @xmath28 . on the other hand , detection of non - zero primordial @xmath27 and/or @xmath28 may probe fundamental physics in the early universe , such as the presence of a primordial homogeneous @xcite or helical @xcite magnetic field which would induce faraday rotation and non - zero @xmath27 correlations .",
    "parity - asymmetric gravity dynamics during inflation may generate a discrepancy among left and right - handed gravitational waves , so that @xmath27 and @xmath28 are non - zero @xcite .",
    "particle physics models with non - standard parity - violating interactions also predict non - vanishing @xmath27 and @xmath29 signals @xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on a class of models that exhibit parity violations in the photon sector .",
    "a chern - simons term is introduced in the effective lagrangian @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the maxwell tensor and @xmath32 the 4-potential .",
    "the 4-vector @xmath33 may be interpreted as the derivative of the quintessence field or the gradient of a function of the ricci scalar @xcite . in either case",
    "a @xmath4 violation always arises provided that @xmath34 is non - zero , while @xmath6 and @xmath7 remain intact .",
    "hence , @xmath5 and @xmath0 symmetries are also violated , as well as lorentz invariance , since @xmath35 picks up a preferred direction in space - time . the net effect on a propagating photon",
    "is to rotate its polarization direction by an angle @xmath36 , hence the name `` cosmological birefringence '' .",
    "historically , the effect has being constrained by measuring polarized light from high redshift radio galaxies and quasars @xcite .",
    "obviously , the cmb photons would also be affected and , due to their longer journey , may get a larger rotation .",
    "a consequence for the cmb pattern is the mixing of @xmath21 and @xmath22 modes : the @xmath37 and @xmath28 correlations still vanish at last scattering surface , but the observable cmb spectra are distorted as @xcite : @xmath38 where the primed quantities are rotated . in @xcite , the @xmath39 and @xmath37 power spectra measured by wmap3 together with all six spectra measured by b03 have been used to perform a global fit , yielding a mild detection for a non zero rotation ( but see also @xcite for a similar analysis restricted to the b03 power spectra and @xcite where constraints on the coupling between the quintessence and the psudoscalar of electromagnetism are derived , based again on b03 data ) . using the same data set , a similar result has been found in @xcite , and used to constrain a specific baryo / leptogenesis model , while an interaction between the neutrino asymmetry and a term chern - simons term has been proposed in @xcite as a possible explanation for the result found @xcite .",
    "forecasted constraitns on @xmath40 for high sensitivity experiments such as planck or cmbpol can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we constrain @xmath36 with a wavelet analysis . a rotation of the photon polarization direction leaves an imprint on each resolution element ( or pixel ) of the q and u maps , and a map - based estimator appears appropriate .",
    "wavelets are a natural choice because they allow for multi - scale pixel analysis .",
    "we compute the wavelet cross - correlation coefficients for @xmath27 and @xmath28 to build a goodness of fit estimator that we apply to the wmap3 @xmath41 maps .",
    "our analysis is complementary to that of @xcite , where the information for @xmath27 and @xmath28 comes from b03 .",
    "the two analyses differ in the method and ( substantially ) in the data set ( the only overlap being the wmap3 temperature map ) . in the following ,",
    "we derive more stringent limits on @xmath36 by adapting the wavelet formalism to tackle polarization , a point that has not been addressed to date in the cmb literature .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section [ sect : method ] we describe our wavelet based method to constrain @xmath36 : section [ sect : sim ] we define a suitable estimator and apply it to wmap3 data , making use of numerical simulations .",
    "finally in section [ sect : concl ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "given a position @xmath42 , wavelets are filter functions @xmath43 that also depend on a characteristic scale @xmath44 and translation @xmath45 .",
    "they provide scale - varying transforms that remain localized in pixel space .",
    "moreover , they consist of an infinite set of basis functions , thus providing some freedom of choice in matching their functional form to the target signal .",
    "several authors have exploited this flexibility as a powerful tool in cmb data analysis .",
    "wavelets have been used for denoising @xcite , point source extraction @xcite , foreground removal @xcite and for detecting the integrated sachs wolfe effect @xcite .",
    "since the wavelet transform preserves linearity , its coefficients can be used to constrain the statistics of the field at different scales . in particular , the spherical mexican hat wavelet ( smhw ) has been used to flag statistical anomalies in the wmap data @xcite and to constrain primordial non - gaussianity @xcite ( other types of wavelets have been shown to be sensitive to yet different anomalies , e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "smhw are generated from ordinary mh wavelets through a stereographic projection on the tangent plane @xcite that is known to preserve their basic properties @xcite .",
    "the smhw is defined as : @xmath46 ^ 2\\left[2-(\\frac{y}{r})^2e^{-y^2/2r^2}\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath47 ( @xmath48 is the polar angle ) , @xmath44 is the scale of convolution , and @xmath49 a normalization factor . for a t map , the wavelets coefficients",
    "are : @xmath50 this convolution can be performed in harmonic space : @xmath51 where @xmath52 are the legendre expansion coefficients of the smhw .",
    "handling polarization requires more care , since @xmath15 and @xmath16 are not rotationally invariant , being components of the rank 2 tensor @xmath53 @xcite . by taking the covariant derivatives of @xmath53",
    ", one can build two quantities that are rotational invariant and hence decomposed by s harmonics .",
    "this leads , again , to the @xmath21 and @xmath22 coefficients : @xmath54 here : stands for the covariant derivatives on the sphere , @xmath55 is the levi - civita trace - free antisymmetric tensor and @xmath56 a normalization factor @xcite .",
    "we similarly define smhw coefficients as : @xmath57 note that we never explicitly compute derivatives , since the integrals can be performed in harmonic space ( c.f .",
    "[ eq : wavecoeff ] ) , provided we divide out the factor @xmath56 .",
    "finally , we consider the pixel - pixel cross correlation of the smhw coefficients as our main statistic : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is a volume normalization that can be taken to be proportional to the total number of pixels @xmath61 .",
    "the quantities in eq .",
    "[ eq : intcross ] possess the same p symmetry of the usual harmonic cross spectra : they can be non - zero only if parity conservation is violated .",
    "to constrain @xmath36 , the following scheme was employed .",
    "we modified the healpix package @xcite to generate a set of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations for @xmath62 maps containing a cmb signal whose polarization pattern is rotated according to eqs.[eq : tc]-[eq : cc ] ; we use the wmap3 best fit model as the ( unrotated ) fiducial angular power spectrum .",
    "the signal maps were smoothed according to the wmap3 optical transfer function .",
    "we also simulated noise maps consistent with the wmap3 instrumental properties .",
    "we add to each signal map a noise realization consistent with the wmap3 instrumental properties . simulating noise in tqu maps",
    "is more complicated than for t only , because the noise values of different stokes parameters within a given pixel are usually correlated . for wmap3",
    ", @xmath12 is very weakly correlated with @xmath15 and @xmath16 , so this coupling can be safely neglected  @xcite . on the contrary , in order to obtain accurate results one has to take into account the correlations between @xmath15 and @xmath16 . the wmap team has released @xmath63 effective hits arrays ( hereafter , @xmath64 where the off diagonal elements represent the @xmath65 inter pixel correlation ( off pixel correlations are very weak and can be neglected ) ; these matrices are given for each differential assembly ( da ) and for each observation year . to simulate noise maps ,",
    "the following scheme is employed : for a given da and for each pixel , we add the @xmath66 arrays for different years .",
    "the three year , noise maps for each da @xmath67 are then simulated as : @xmath68 where @xmath69 identifies a given pixel , @xmath70 is the nominal da polarization sensitivity , as provided by the wmap team  @xcite and @xmath71 is the choleski factor of @xmath72 . the resulting noise plus signal maps for each da",
    "are then weighted averaged to form a combined map comprising all da s in the q , v and w bands : @xmath73^{-1}\\sum_i^{n_{da}}\\mathbf{c}_{ip}^{-1}\\left ( \\begin{array}{c } q_{ip}\\\\ u_{ip}\\end{array}\\right)\\ ] ] the combined map for @xmath12 is computed by using the standard , scalar version of the procedure above : @xmath74.\\ ] ] to minimize residual foreground contamination we chose to use a rather conservative mask , the intersection of the kp0 and p02 sky cuts @xcite .",
    "the masked maps are downgraded in resolution to @xmath75 .",

    "@xmath83 is computed over the q+v+w foreground - cleaned , optimally - weighted data map , while the mean ( barred ) quantities are derived from @xmath84 mc simulations .",
    "the covariance matrix @xmath85 is estimated over a fresh set of simulations ( @xmath86 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : averagestc ] we show , as a function of @xmath44 , the mc mean values for @xmath87 , for @xmath88 with a step of @xmath89 .",

    ", we keep the dependence of @xmath36 in the estimator s covariance matrix ( but find no significant change in our results if we drop this dependence : for wmap3 , our estimator s covariance is completely dominated by noise ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : like ] we show the likelihoods of wmap3 data for @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "thus , we find no evidence of parity violation from the wmap3 data .",
    "these limits are slightly tighter than those given in @xcite , where a marginal detection for a non - zero @xmath40 is claimed and seems to be driven by the gc b03 data .     for cg ( dotted ) and tc ( dashed ) , computed from the wavelet estimator on wmap3 data .",

    "this procedure extends to polarization the test suggested by @xcite for temperature data .    as a futher consistency check",
    ", we compared our estimator with a similar one , built using the angular power spectrum rather than wavelets . in the case of pure signal , under the assumption of gaussianity and statistical isotropy of the observed field , we expect the two approaches to provide similar constrains . to show this is indeed the case , we have repeated the procedure of section [ sect : sim ] performing a monte carlo simulation over 1000 realizations in the ideal case of pure signal .",

    "in summary , we have presented the first application of wavelets to polarized cmb maps , and used it to constrain the rotation angle of cmb photons in search of a signature due to cosmological birefringence , an effect connected to fundamental symmetry - breaking physics .",
    "we find no evidence of such a rotation and present the best upper limits to date on cmb data .",
    "this result should be compared with @xcite , where a marginal detection for a non - zero @xmath36 is claimed .",
    "the latter result is mostly based on the b03 data and only makes use of a subset of the wmap3 dataset , _ not _ including the @xmath27 correlations from which our results are essentially derived . while wmap3 has lower signal to noise _ per pixel _ than b03 , the analysis presented here uses data from @xmath105 of the whole sky , while the limited useful sky coverage of b03 ( @xmath106 ) severely limits the statistical power of @xmath27 , so the detection in @xcite appears to be driven from the much harder to measure ( and prone to systematic effects ) @xmath28 correlations  , thus confirming a mild detection of a non - zero rotation angle .",
    "it would be very interesting to understand to what extent this is driven by the b03 dataset .",
    "an extension of our analysis to the b03 tqu maps ( not yet public at the time of writing ) is under study . ] . given the quantity and quality of the cmb data anticipated over the next few years , our approach demonstrates that substantially stronger limits on parity violation should be feasible .",
