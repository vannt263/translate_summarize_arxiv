    "the trapping of neutral particles has paved the way for remarkable achievements in atomic and molecular physics , culminating with the observation of degenerate bose and fermi gases @xcite .",
    "the ability to confine the ground state of neutral particles is becoming important for an increasing number of experiments , in particular for collision studies @xcite .",
    "the ground state of any neutral particle is always attracted towards a point of maximum field , but it can not be trapped in a static field , as static fields can not possess a maximum in free space @xcite . trapping in the ground state",
    "is therefore only possible when electrodynamic fields are used .",
    "for example , any sublevel of the ground state can be confined in the laser field maximum of a dipole trap @xcite , which has been successfully demonstrated for both atoms @xcite and molecules @xcite .",
    "additionally , paramagnetic particles can be trapped using ac magnetic fields , as shown for ground - state cs atoms @xcite .",
    "trapping by ac electric fields is a more versatile method , applicable to any ground - state atom or molecule . for polar molecules strong",
    "confinement can be achieved via the first - order stark interaction . for atoms and nonpolar molecules , trapping is based on the second - order stark interaction between an external electric field and the induced dipole moment . similarly to trapping of ions in a paul trap @xcite , three - dimensional confinement in an ac electric trap is achieved by alternating between two saddle - point configurations of the electric field .",
    "the first configuration has attractive ( focusing ) forces along one direction and repulsive ( defocusing ) forces along the other two directions , while in the second configuration the roles of the forces are reversed .",
    "dynamic confinement of the particles is obtained by switching between these two configurations at the appropriate frequency .",
    "the first demonstration of ac electric trapping was carried out for ammonia molecules using a cylindrically symmetric trap with a depth of several millikelvins @xcite .",
    "similar trap depths were later obtained for the same molecule with a linear ac trap @xcite . in the meantime ,",
    "katori and coworkers achieved trapping of about 100 ground - state sr atoms with a lifetime of 80 ms in a microstructured ac trap on a chip @xcite .",
    "recently , we demonstrated trapping of about 10@xmath0 rb atoms in a 1 mm@xmath1 large and several microkelvins deep trap , with a lifetime of about 5 s @xcite . our trap is also based on the cylindrically symmetric geometry suggested by peik @xcite .",
    "it allowed for the first direct visualization of the dynamic confinement in an ac trap using absorption images taken at different phases of the ac switching cycle .",
    "subsequently , trapping of ultracold rb atoms was also obtained with a three - phase ac electric trap @xcite , as proposed by shimizu and morinaga @xcite .",
    "a recent paper describes in detail the ac trap geometries currently used to electrically confine neutral atoms and molecules @xcite .    in this paper , we present a detailed experimental investigation of the dynamics in the ac trap and study the dependence of the atom number on the switching - cycle parameters . compared to our previous measurements @xcite , we have optimized the number of trapped atoms by introducing an evaporative cooling stage before loading the atoms into the ac trap .",
    "as the depth of the ac trap is small , the reduction in temperature helped increase the number of confined particles , which in turn improved the quality of our images .",

    "note that the saddle points are displaced in @xmath8 due to the dc quadrupole field used for gravity compensation .",
    "the @xmath8-direction gradients for this field have the same value for both trapping configurations .    -focusing ( a ) and @xmath8-focusing ( b ) configurations . ]    to describe the fields in the trap , we approximate the electric potential by a multipole expansion . taking the cylindrical symmetry into account , the first five terms read @xmath12 where @xmath13 mm is the distance between the end cap electrodes and the @xmath14 characterize the different multipole terms .",

    "this is important because small inaccuracies and misalignments of the electrodes can have a strong impact on the trapping fields .    to probe the electric fields in the ac trap",
    ", the usual experimental sequence is followed with the only exception that the electric fields are kept on while taking absorption images of the cloud .",
    "the atoms are confined in the ac trap for a short trapping time during the first switching cycle and the electrodes are switched to ground after obtaining the absorption images . to compensate for the resulting stark shift",
    ", the absorption beam is detuned by several megahertz while the atoms are probed .",
    "we have already seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : trapfields ] that the electric field strength varies significantly over the size of the atom cloud .",

    "the @xmath32 sublevels remain degenerate in an electric field . in the @xmath35",
    "excited state , however , the degeneracy is lifted due to the tensor polarizability @xcite , as seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : starkshift ] .",
    "this gives rise to four possible energy differences ( stark shifts ) between the two states , which are plotted in fig .",

    "the atoms are imaged immediately after switching to the @xmath8-focusing configuration , namely , after a trapping time of 9.84 ms .",
    "the difference in trapping times for the two configurations is tiny and ensures that the atom density distributions are identical .",
    "additionally , for these short trapping times the atom cloud is dense , resulting in a good absorption signal .",
    "the experiment is repeated , varying the probe detuning from -22 to -38  mhz .",
    "depending on the detuning , different electric field regions are visible , thus enabling direct probing of the field distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trapfields ] .",

    "additionally , in the case of @xmath8 focusing , the higher fields towards larger @xmath9 play a role",
    ". nonetheless , the highest fields on the left and on the right side of the trap are not visible because the atom cloud is more dilute at larger @xmath9 , and therefore the atom density is too low to image these trap regions .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : design ] , our simulations are carried out using a finite - element program to determine the electric field in the trap .",

    "the probe beam is linearly polarized with its polarization vector almost parallel to this axis . in general , if linearly polarized light is aligned with the quantization axis , there are no circular polarization components .",
    "therefore , the probe beam drives only transitions with @xmath38 , as indicated in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : starkshift ] .",
    "hence , no transitions to the @xmath39 levels of the upper @xmath35 state are possible .",
    "the strength of the allowed transitions varies as shown in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : starkshift ] and is accounted for in the simulations by weighting the transitions accordingly .",
    "the natural linewidth of the transition is 6 mhz ; therefore the beam can simultaneously excite transitions with different @xmath32 , if the upper sublevels are close enough in frequency .",
    "the linewidth of the laser is in the submegahertz regime and thus has a negligible contribution .    from the simulations we determine that the actual fields in the @xmath9-focusing configuration are lower than expected for the ideal geometry presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : picturetrap ] . in contrast ,",
    "the simulations for @xmath8 focusing match well .",

    "we will now examine the onset of stable ac electric trapping by imaging cloud shapes after a small number of switching cycles .",
    "figure [ fig : figure1 ] shows the gradual formation of a trapped cloud as an increasing number @xmath40 of full switching cycles is applied .",
    "the absorption images always show the 2 mm gap between the ring electrodes . in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1](a ) only one switching cycle at 60 hz has been employed and the atoms completely fill the space available to them . note that without application of this switching cycle the atoms would have by now fallen out of view due to gravity .",

    "[ fig : figure1](b ) , the shape of the cloud has changed dramatically .",

    "[ fig : figure1](d ) and [ fig : figure1](e ) .",
    "however , most of the atoms are still metastably trapped and will finally escape from the trap .",
    "after @xmath44 and @xmath45 switching cycles , the cloud exhibits an asymmetric shape , which is visible in figs .",
    "[ fig : figure1](e ) and [ fig : figure1](f ) , respectively .",
    "this asymmetry can be attributed to possible misalignments between the center of the magnetic trap and the center of the ac trap . even after @xmath46 switching cycles [ fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1](g ) ] the shape is not as smooth as in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1](h ) after @xmath47 switching cycles .",
    "a small feature is still visible on the left side of the cloud .",
    "however , the shape remains unchanged at longer trapping times , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1](i ) where the number of atoms has decreased due to collisions with the background gas .",
    "we also studied the atom loss from the trap more quantitatively by recording the number of atoms in the first 0.5  s of trapping .",
    "the fast decrease during the first ten switching cycles observed in the images can be fitted by an exponential yielding a @xmath48 lifetime of about 100 ms .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that most of the metastably trapped atoms leave the trap region within the first few switching cycles .",
    "figure [ fig : lifetime ] illustrates the lifetime in the ac trap , which is limited by the collisions with the background gas .",
    "displayed is the number of atoms versus the trapping time in seconds .",
    "we image the atom cloud at trapping times of up to 15 s , which corresponds to @xmath49 switching cycles at the switching frequency of 60 hz .",
    "the data points are fit using a double exponential yielding a value of 9 s for the lifetime and a value of 1 s for the fast decay . similarly to the 100 ms decay in the previous paragraph , this fast decay accounts for metastably trapped atoms .",
    "these atoms , however , survive in the trap much longer , as they almost have the correct initial conditions to be stably trapped .",
    "the 9 s lifetime value is consistent with measurements of a magnetically trapped cloud , performed in the same vacuum chamber .",
    "we therefore conclude that at least 60 switching cycles have to be used in the experiment .",
    "otherwise , the dynamics would be mainly guided by the behavior of metastably trapped atoms .",
    "imaging the atoms after a trapping time of 1  s is a good compromise between stable behavior of the atoms and good signals , as longer trapping times suffer from atom loss due to background collisions .",
    "in this section , we first visualize the dynamic confinement of the atoms in the trap by looking at the atomic distribution at different times within a switching cycle . from this",
    "we can qualitatively understand the motion in the trap .",

    "as the atoms do not have well - defined gaussian velocity distributions across the entire switching cycle , the fwhm fits of the expanding cloud can have large error bars .",
    "this is primarily the case for ac trapping times where the motion of the atoms is governed by the defocusing forces , i.e. , from the middle of the defocusing phase to the middle of the next focusing phase .",
