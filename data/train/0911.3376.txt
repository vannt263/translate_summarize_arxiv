    "in recent years , there has been a revived interest in the possibility of gravitino dark matter within the framework of r - violating supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "there are several reasons for this . in the much - studied cmssm @xcite ,",
    "scenarios with neutralino dark matter have become rather constrained , requiring a considerable amount of fine - tuning . the additional fact that r - parity is imposed essentially by hand , and",
    "alternative schemes are equally viable from the theoretical point of view , has motivated the search for other dark matter candidates . in the case that r - parity is violated , neutralinos and other sparticles decay too fast to be dark matter , even for small couplings , however , this is not the case for gravitinos , which raise very interesting possibilities . indeed , if gravitinos decay slowly enough for their lifetime to exceed the age of the universe  @xcite , they can be considered essentially stable and a good dark matter candidate . while cosmologically stable , gravitinos may still have decays of interest to astrophysics measurements of cosmic rays in various particle species .",
    "trilinear r - violating couplings have the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the left - handed lepton ( quark ) doublet superfields , and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) are the corresponding left - handed singlet fields . due to su(2 ) and su(3 ) invariance , we have 9 @xmath8 operators @xmath9 , 27 @xmath10 , and 9 @xmath11 operators @xmath12 .",
    "these couplings are known to give rise to very interesting collider phenomenology , with the missing energy signature of the much studied minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) being in part substituted by multi - lepton and/or multi - jet events  @xcite .",
    "the same r - violating operators that lead to the decay of sparticles produced in collider experiments , will also cause gravitino dark matter to decay .",
    "this takes place via two - body radiative loop decays to neutrino and photon  @xcite , and via tree - level decays to three fermions  @xcite .",
    "the decay rates have been presented in detail in the original references , where it was found that , for light gravitino masses and appropriate fermions in the loop , radiative decays may dominate , while for heavier gravitinos , three - body decays take over .",
    "the behavior of the total decay rate is primarily controlled by the gravitino mass dependence of the partial decay widths .",
    "these scale as @xmath13 for three - body decays away from the kinematic threshold , which plays an important role in our considerations , comes about as follows : there is a factor of @xmath14 from phase space , such as in muon decays , in addition , there is a factor of @xmath15 in the matrix element , since the gravitational coupling is proportional to the four - momentum . ] , and radiative decays with gravitino masses well below those of the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) and sufficiently above the kinematic threshold of its decay products .",
    "moreover , the results are very dependent on the flavour structure of r - violating operators , which is discussed extensively in  @xcite .",
    "to constitute a realistic dark matter candidate , the minimal requirement is that the gravitino lifetime should exceed the age of the universe , which may naturally occur due to the planck scale suppression in the gravitino vertex , the smallness of the r - parity - violating coupling , and the additional loop / phase - space suppression in the radiative / tree - level diagrams .",
    "in addition , cosmic rays from slow gravitino decays have to be consistent with observations , _",
    "e.g. _ the photon flux measured in the egret experiment  @xcite .",
    "the extra - galactic photon flux has been shown to set severe bounds on gravitino decays and thus on the allowed combinations of gravitino masses and r - violating couplings @xcite . recently ,",
    "new results on the flux of charged particles have been published by the atic  @xcite , pamela  @xcite , and fermi lat collaborations  @xcite .",
    "these show possible excesses that , modulo unknown astrophysical sources , could signal new physics .",
    "one could also consider the possibility of tree level decays to a neutrino and photon through neutrino  neutralino mixing .",
    "this decay width is directly proportional to the r - parity violating operators contribution to the neutrino masses . for a given choice of basis @xcite ,",
    "this in turn depends on the alignment between the vevs of the neutral scalar components of the superfields @xmath16 and the coefficients of the bilinear terms @xmath17 , where @xmath18 are potentially non - zero bilinear r - violating operators .",
    "the expected charged particle spectra of mixing induced decays have recently been studied in detail in @xcite , and the neutrino spectra in @xcite .",
    "the alignment angle is very restricted in order to comply with neutrino mass bounds , and a completely general phenomenological model allows these decays to be sub - dominant to the decays discussed above .",
    "thus , our present letter complements these analyses for the case of decays dominated by trilinear r - violating operators . as we will demonstrate , under certain assumptions on the background electron spectrum , it is possible to simultaneously fit the pamela data on the positron and antiproton fractions and the fermi lat data on the electron - plus - positron spectrum .",
    "such a fit requires high gravitino masses , and the resulting gamma ray spectrum predicted from electron bremsstrahlung should be testable with the upcoming fermi lat data . for the neutrinos",
    "we find that their flux will be very difficult to detect in both present and near - future experiments .",
    "this letter is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : charged ] , we study charged fermion and anti - fermion spectra from gravitino decays using a standard galactic propagation model .",
    "we attempt a fit to the pamela and fermi lat data , discussing the limitations of the background model , and we set limits on the r - parity violating couplings as a function of the gravitino mass . in section  [ sec : photons ] , after discussing our procedure and the handling of experimental uncertainties , we proceed to a study of photonic spectra ; we discuss the information that can be obtained from characteristic peaks directly linked to the magnitude and flavour of the r - violating couplings , the mass of the gravitino and the susy spectrum .",
    "furthermore , we make predictions corresponding to our best fits to the pamela and fermi lat data , and show that these can be tested in the near future , either supporting our considerations , or setting even more severe bounds on r - violating couplings . in section  [ sec : neutrinos ] we discuss the potential for observation of the neutrino spectra from gravitino decays . finally in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we summarise our results and look at future prospects .",
    "gravitinos decaying through the tree level diagrams that are induced by trilinear r - violating operators , will produce charged particles , which , for appropriate values of the gravitino mass and the r - violating couplings may help to explain recent experimental data on cosmic rays . of particular interest in this respect",
    "is the measurement of the cosmic ray positron fraction by pamela  @xcite and the fermi lat results  @xcite on the cosmic ray electron spectrum that both show excesses , but in somewhat different energy ranges .",
    "in addition , the non - observation of any anomaly in the antiproton data as reported by pamela@xcite is important in constraining the possible parameter space .",
    "we calculate the electron , positron and antiproton spectra in the gravitino rest frame for a particular gravitino mass and r - violating coupling .",
    "we study the decay of gravitinos using pythia 6.4  @xcite , and the branching ratios and lifetime given by the formulae in  @xcite . after being produced",
    ", charged particles will propagate through the galaxy .",
    "although we have substantial information about the various processes that give important contributions , this propagation still contains large uncertainties . for a recent review of cosmic ray propagation ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the most important propagation effects come from diffusion processes caused by galactic magnetic fields and scattering off magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves ; this spatial diffusion causes the received spectra to be essentially isotropic .",
    "the scattering off mhd waves also causes diffusion in momentum space known as diffusive re - acceleration .",
    "it is also possible that an important role is played by convection due to galactic winds . at present",
    ", it seems that the most appropriate model for galactic propagation is a diffusion model , possibly extended with some convection  @xcite . on top of this , charged particles are losing energy due to synchrotron radiation , bremsstrahlung , ionization and inverse compton scattering .    to take all these effects into account",
    ", we use the galprop code  @xcite with a conventional diffusion model , similar to ` model 0 ' in  @xcite .",
    "the main parameters adopted for galprop are given in table  [ table : galprop params ] .",
    "the dark matter component of the various fluxes incident on the earth has been calculated assuming a navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) @xcite dark matter density profile for our galaxy : @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the distance to the center of the galaxy , @xmath21  kpc and @xmath22  gev  @xmath23 .",

    "so far we have exclusively fitted to the fermi lat data and ignored the atic data .",
    "it is of course possible to fit to the atic data instead .",
    "as has been mentioned above , this favors a larger amount of electron flavour in the operator and it turns out that the best operator for the atic data is @xmath42 .",
    "since the atic data is less smooth than the fermi lat data , it is not possible to fit it equally well .",
    "the large error bars in the peak of the atic data also reduce the tension between the electron - plus - positron data and the positron fraction data , suggesting that fitting to fermi lat is the more reasonable and constraining approach .",

    "it is interesting to note some important differences between this scheme and dark matter annihilation scenarios : direct annihilation to lepton pairs gives a large contribution of monochromatic electrons and positrons in the cm frame .",
    "even when galactic propagation is taken into account , it is difficult to achieve the smooth excess over the background spectrum that is observed by fermi lat .",
    "consequently , dark matter annihilation to an electron - positron pair seems largely excluded as an explanation of the fermi lat  @xcite excess . for gravitino decays , on the other hand",

    "let us finally comment on the consequences of the above for the lhc . as can be seen in table  [ table : fit_fermi ] , due to the large gravitino masses and the @xmath48 dependence of the gravitino decay width , the r - parity violating couplings need to be very small in order to fit the data , @xmath49 .",
    "this implies that , in such a scheme , r - parity violation can not be observed at the lhc unless the nlsp is charged and can be stopped .",
    "the large sparticle masses required also imply that the production cross section is very low , if at all non - zero .      in the case of @xmath43 and @xmath50 operators , one would also expect production of protons and antiprotons within the quark jets .",

    "_ , width=642 ]      from the above discussion , it follows that the r - violating couplings can be significantly constrained by the charged particle data .",
    "we determine such limits by varying the gravitino mass and the coupling , while restricting the operator to give a total flux that does not exceed any data point by more than @xmath53 .",
    "to be conservative when setting the bounds there are no backgrounds included in these calculations , except in the case of the positron fraction where the electron background has to be included in order to get a meaningful result ; the positron background , however , is not included .",
    "in contrast to the fits , we are using here the full spectra of the pamela data .",

    "sufficiently large contributions to the high energy electron spectrum can then be obtained either via some electron flavour in the operator ( @xmath94 or @xmath95 ) or by going to even higher gravitino masses .",
    "the decaying dark matter scenario discussed in this letter has a significant advantage over dark matter annihilation scenarios , where it is hard to achieve a spectrum that is smooth enough to explain the electron excess observed by fermi lat .",
    "* @xmath96 operators may give a reasonable fit to the fermi lat data alone , but can not then fit the pamela data due to positron excesses at low energies and the over - production of antiprotons .",
    "in fact , the pamela antiproton data give very tight constraints on all @xmath43 and @xmath51 couplings for high gravitino masses .",
    "* for the range of gravitino masses that can match the pamela and fermi lat data , three - body decays are likely to dominate , implying the absence of the observable peak of monochromatic photons found in two - body radiative gravitino decays .",
    "large photon fluxes are still expected , due to bremsstrahlung off charged particles and pion decays .",
    "such fluxes are a necessary consequence of our scenario and should be detectable by fermi lat for parameters that can explain the charged particle excesses , meaning that fermi lat will be capable of supporting or ruling out this explanation of the electron and positron anomalies . *",
    "neutrinos directly produced from the three - body decays have a quite sharp peak around @xmath74 , which , with the sharp rise in effective area with energy , gives some hope of future detection at icecube .",
    "in particular , despite only measuring the muon energy from the neutrino interaction , this may lead to a better gravitino mass determination than what is possible from bremsstrahlung photons .",
    "summarising , it is interesting to observe that our predictions on the basis of the pamela and fermi lat data are very restrictive , and imply that in the future this scenario will either be confirmed , or very strict bounds will be imposed on r - violating couplings for heavy gravitino masses .",
    "it is also interesting to note that r - violating couplings too small to detect at the lhc , can be probed through the study of photon and ( anti-)particle spectra .",
