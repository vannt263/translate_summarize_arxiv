    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are short - period binaries in which a late - type , roche - lobe - filling main - sequence dwarf transfers gas through an accretion disk onto a rotating , accretion - heated white dwarf ( wd ) .",
    "the nova - like variables are a subclass of cvs in which the mass - transfer rate is high and the light of the system is dominated by a very bright accretion disk .",
    "the spectra of nova - like variables resemble those of classical novae ( cn ) that have settled back to quiescence .",
    "however , nova - like variables have never had a recorded cn outburst .",

    "then , just as unpredictably , they return to the high - brightness state .",
    "these drops are possibly related to cessation of mass transfer from the k - m dwarf secondary star either by starspots positioned under l1 @xcite or irradiation feedback in which an inflated outer disk can modulate the mass transfer from the secondary by blocking irradiation of the hot inner accretion disk region @xcite .    as part of a hubble space telescope snapshot project extending over three hubble observing cycles ( b. gnsicke , pi )",

    "bk lyn ( pg0917 + 342 ) is an extraordinary nova - like variable with an orbital period placing it below the cv period gap . as such , it is the only bona fide nova - like variable below the cv period gap @xcite .",
    "it was classified a short period dwarf nova by @xcite but long term light curves from roboscope ( 98 exposures over three years ) and the harvard plate collection reveal no evidence for dwarf nova outbursts or even low optical brightness states .",

    "a far ultraviolet iue spectrum of v751 cygni was taken on april 25 , 1985 when the system was at or near optical maximum .",
    "the spectrum , swp25574 , was obtained at low dispersion through the large aperture . the visual magnitude with the fine error sensor ( fes ) was v(fes ) = 14.2 while a longer wavelength uv spectrum , lwp05819 , yielded an interstellar reddening value e(@xmath10 ) = 0.25@xmath70.05 from the 2200a feature @xcite .",
    "the large amount of reddening introduces additional uncertainty .",
    "based upon the lack of emission lines and upon a study by @xcite of equivalent width versus orbital inclinations for vy scl stars , @xcite concluded that a low inclination ( @xmath1150@xmath12 ) is indicated .",

    "@xcite carried out a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the system and reported negative superhumps and the unexpected detection of soft x - rays instead of the predicted hard x - rays , during the low optical brightness state of v751 cygni when the boundary layer of the wd is optically thin .",
    "they suggest that v751 cyg is a supersoft x - ray binary , with a white dwarf undergoing mass accretion at a high enough rate to cause quasi - steady hydrogen burning on the surface .",

    "v751 cyg could also be an sw sex star as well .",

    "@xcite improved its orbital period and measured h - alpha emission radial velocity variations with an amplitude of  400 km / sec .",
    "photometric observations have revealed orbital variability with possible negative superhumps .",
    "the reddening of the systems was taken from available estimates in the literature .",
    "the three principal sources of reddening for cataclysmic variables are the compilations of @xcite .",
    "for v751 cygni , @xcite gave e(@xmath10 ) = 0.25@xmath70.05 which is the value we adopted for v751 cygni .",

    "the spectrum of bk lyn was not dereddened as the galactic reddening in the direction of bk lyn is very small @xmath19 .",
    "the observed properties of all three systems are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we have computed strict lower limit distances to bk lyn , v751 cygni and v380 oph using a method by @xcite which uses 2mass jhk photometry . for each system",

    "@xcite provides absolute j , h and k magnitudes based upon his semi - empirical donor sequence for cvs .",
    "if it is assumed that the donor provides 100% of the light in j , h and k , then the distance is a strict lower limit . if the donor emits 33% of the light ( the remainder being accretion light )",

    "the latter limit is a factor of 1.75 times the lower limit distance .",
    "the lower limit distances are used as constraints in the synthetic spectral fitting procedures described below . for bk lyn",
    ", this leads to a lower limit distance of 116 pc , for v380 oph , this method yields a range of distance from 293 pc ( strict lower limit ) to 513 pc while for v751 cygni , we obtained a range 201 pc ( strict lower limit ) to 352 pc .",
    "fuv spectroscopy of bk lyn , v751 cygni and v380 oph was obtained with _",
    "hst_/stis during _ hst _ cycle 11 .",
    "the data were obtained using the g140l grating and the @xmath20 aperture , providing a spectral resolution of r@xmath21 over the wavelength range 1140 - 1720  .",
    "since the total time involved in each snapshot observation was short ( @xmath22min ) , the observations were made in the accum mode in order to minimize the instrument overheads .",
    "this resulted in exposure times of 600 to 900 seconds .",
    "each snapshot observation resulted in a single time averaged spectrum of each system . all of the spectral data were processed with iraf using calstis v2.13b.during target acquisition , _ hst _ points at the nominal target coordinates and takes a @xmath23 ccd image with an exposure time of a few seconds .",
    "subsequently , a small slew is performed that centers the target in the acquisition box , and a second ccd image is taken .",
    "the acquisition imagesfor these observations were obtained using the f28x50lp long - pass filter , which has a central wavelength of 7228.5 and a full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 2721.6  @xcite .",
    "the instrumental setup and exposure details of the _ hst _ stis spectra of bk lyn , v380 oph and v751 cygni are provided in the observing log given in table 2 , the entries are by column : ( 1 ) the target , ( 2 ) data i d , ( 3 ) instrument config / mode , ( 4 ) grating , ( 5 ) aperture , ( 6 ) date of observation ( yyyy - mm - dd ) , ( 7 ) time of observation , and ( 8) exposure time ( s ) .      until 2003 , there were no fuv spectra of bk lyn with which to check for p cygni profiles indicating wind outflow or an analyze the fuv spectral slope or fuv line profiles . as part of an hst snapshot program ( see above ) , the first fuv spectrum of bk lyn was secured .",
    "the spectrum is displayed in fig.1 where a steeply rising continuum toward shorter wavelengths is seen together with strong emission features at c iii ( 1175 ) , nv ( 1240 ) , si iii + oi ( 1300 ) , c ii ( 1335 ) , si iv ( 1400 ) , c iv ( 1550 ) and weak he ii ( 1640 ) emission . the emission lines suggest it is probable that an accretion disk is present in the system at the time of our hst spectrum .",
    "the continuum flux level ranges from @xmath9 2 x 10@xmath24 ergs/@xmath25/s /    at the short end to @xmath9 1.2 @xmath26 10@xmath24 ergs/@xmath25/s /    at the long wavelength end .",
    "the presence of strong emission lines coupled with the low flux level and the steeply rising continuum are not characteristic of the fuv spectra of nova - like variables in their high optical brightness states unless the inclination angle is high .",
    "we note that the emission lines and continuum slope in bk lyn s spectrum are strikingly similar in appearence to the hst and hut spectra of the dwarf nova ss cygni in quiescence ( see fig.4 in long et al.2005 ) as well as the fuv spectrum of v794 aql in its high state ( godon et al.2007 ) .",
    "the f28@xmath2650lp magnitude from the acquisition exposure was 15.3 , roughly consistent with a high state but slightly fainter than the normal visual magnitude range of 14.6 to 14.7 .",
    "the stis spectrum of v751 cygni reveals moderately strong absorption features seen against a continuum rising toward shorter wavelengths . the fuv continuum even after de - reddening , has a relatively flat slope while the ly@xmath6 profile is rather narrow .",
    "this poses a considerable challenge in finding an accretion disk spectral energy distribution which satisfies both the continuum slope and yields the observed ly@xmath6 line width in a single disk model .",
    "the narrow width of ly@xmath6 should be associated with a much steeper continuum slope than is observed in the spectra .",
    "our hst stis spectrum confirms the identification of he ii ( 1640 ) in absorption although the equivalent width of the feature is smaller than seen in the iue spectrum ( see section 1.1 above ) .",
    "thed c iv ( 1550 ) absorption lines reveals a hint of p cygni structure probably indicating wind noutflow at the time the stis spectrum was obtained .",
    "the stis spectrum of v380 oph is dominated by strong broad emission features superimposed on a continuum rising toward shorter wavelengths for v380 oph .",
    "we found the same inconsistency between the observed width of the ly@xmath6 profile and the observed continuuum slope .",
    "several weak , sharp absorption features are most likely of interstellar origin . for v380",
    "oph , we found the same inconsistency between the observed width of the ly@xmath6 profile and the observed continuuum slope .",
    "this led us to first explore the effect of interstellar reddening on the spectrum .    in table 3 , we have listed the strongest spectral features detected for each system .",
    "we adopted model accretion disks from the optically thick disk model grid of @xcite . in these accretion disk models ,",
    "the innermost disk radius , r@xmath27 , is fixed at a fractional white dwarf radius of @xmath28 .",
    "the outermost disk radius , r@xmath29 , was chosen so that t@xmath30 is near 10,000k since disk annuli beyond this point , which are cooler zones with larger radii , would provide only a very small contribution to the mid and far uv disk flux , particularly the swp fuv bandpass .",
    "the mass transfer rate is assumed to be the same for all radii .",
    "thus , the run of disk temperature with radius is taken to be :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 and @xmath33    the disk is divided into a set of ring annuli .",
    "the vertical structure of each ring is computed with tlusdisk @xcite , which is a derivative of the stellar atmosphere program tlusty @xcite .",
    "the spectrum synthesis program synspec described by @xcite is used to solve the radiative transfer equation to compute the local , rest frame spectrum for each ring of the disk .",
    "in addition to detailed profiles of the h and he lines , the spectrum synthesis includes metal lines up to nickel ( z = 28 ) .",
    "the accretion disks are computed in lte and the chemical composition of the accretion disk is kept fixed at solar values in our study .",
    "limb darkening of the disk is fully taken into account in the manner described by @xcite involving the eddington - barbier relation , the increase of kinetic temperature with depth in the disk , and the wavelength and temperature dependence of the planck function",
    ".    the details of our @xmath34 ( per degree of freedom ) minimization fitting procedures are discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "we take any reliable published parameters like the wd mass , or orbital inclination only as an initial guess in searching for the best - fitting accretion disk models .",
    "we relax all constraints except the lower limit @xcite distance .",
    "for each systems s spectrum , we carry out fits for every combination of @xmath35 , inclination and white dwarf mass in the @xcite library .",
    "the values of _ i _ are 18 , 41 , 60 , 75 and @xmath36 .",
    "the range of accretion rates covers @xmath37 in steps of 0.5 in the log and five different values of the white dwarf mass , namely , 0.4 , 0.55 , 0.8 , 1.0 , and 1.2 m@xmath38 . out of the roughly 900 models using every combination of @xmath13 , m and m@xmath39",
    ", we try to isolate the best - fitting accretion disk model . in effect , we search for the best fit based upon ( 1 ) the minimum @xmath40 value achieved , ( 2 ) the goodness of fit of the continuum slope , ( 3 ) the goodness of fit to the observed ly@xmath6 region and ( 4 ) consistency of the scale factor - derived distance with the adopted distance or distance constraint . in other words , the fitting solution may not necessarily be the model with the lowest @xmath40 value but rather all other available constraints are used such as constraints on the distance , reliable system parameters if available , absorption line fits , especially the ly@xmath6 wings but sometimes even si ii , si iii , c iii , c ii , si iv and si ii when these features are in absorption and do not have an origin in a wind or corona .",
    "we also search for any statistically significant improvement in the fitting by combining white dwarf models and disk models together using a @xmath40 minimization routine called diskfit .",
    "once again , we find the minimum @xmath40 value achieved for the combined models , and check the combined model consistency with the observed continuum slope and ly@xmath6 region , and consistency of the scale factor - derived distance with the adopted distance or distance constraints .",
    "for the white dwarf radii , we use the mass - radius relation from the evolutionary model grid of @xcite for c - o cores .",
    "for a non - magnetic nova - like variable during its high state , it is reasonable to expect that a steady state optically thick accretion disk might provide a successful fit ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this was our intial expectation for all three nova - likes , bk lyn , v380 oph and v751 cygni .    for bk lyn ,",
    "the most striking feature of its spectrum is the sharp , narrow ly@xmath6 line in combination with a steeply rising continuum .",
    "the narrowness of the ly@xmath6 and steep continuum slope suggested the possiblity that the fuv flux originates from a hot white dwarf photosphere . but a fit to the the continuum slope with a hot photosphere at t=30000k and a nominal white dwarf gravity of log g=8.0 , yields a synthetic ly@xmath6 absorption feature which is far too broad .",
    "however , a narrower profile is obtained by increasing the effective temperature and/or lowering the gravity .",
    "the continuum slope and narrow ly@xmath6 feature of the observed spectrum can be matched with a white dwarf photosphere with t=38000k and log g=7 .",
    "a surface gravity this low would not be inconsistent with the low white dwarf mass derived by @xcite .",
    "however , the distance implied by the fit is 1400 pc while the stellar radius approached that of a hot subdwarf .",
    "moreover , the v - band magnitude of this model fit is 20.6 , which is about five magnitudes fainter than the observed magnitude .",
    "the narrowness of the ly@xmath6 profile also suggested the possibility that it is of interstellar origin .",
    "first , if the system were being viewed at low inclination , then the emission lines which are presumed to be formed in the disk , would not be as broad as observed .",
    "this makes it likely that the narrow ly@xmath6 absorption , given that it is not due to a low gravity white dwarf ( see above ) , is due to interstellar atomic hydrogen .",
    "the reddening toward bk lyn is rather small , possibly as small as @xmath41 but the corresponding density is enough to produce such an absorption .",
    "one needs an h column density of only @xmath42@xmath43 , which is a small fraction of the galactic column in line of sight to bk lyn which is @xmath44@xmath43 .    since a white dwarf photosphere is unlikely to provide the fuv flux , we tried fitting accretion disk models alone to the stis data . because the narrow ly@xmath6 line is almost certainly interstellar , the mass of the white dwarf , inclination angle and distance",
    "are essentially unconstrained except for the lower limit to the distance given by the @xcite method .",
    "moreover , the presence of broad emission lines and the optical radial velocity amplitude of + /-",
    "100 km / s rules out a face - on or very low inclination system .",
    "applying our fitting procedures described above , we found accretion disk model yielded much better fits in every respect than a white dwarf photosphere .",
    "we also tried white dwarf plus accretion disk combination fits but we found that the best fits resulted only when the white dwarf was contributing 1% or less of the fuv flux .",
    "thus our best fitting solutions result when the white dwarf flux contribution is negligible . in table 4",
    "we have summarized the disk model fitting results to the spectrum of bk lyn .    in figures 1 , 2 and 3",
    ", we display the best - fitting accretion disk models for a 1.2 m@xmath38 wd , a 0.8 m@xmath38 wd and a 0.4 m@xmath38 wd .",
    "we find that the disk fitting favors high inclination with the accretion rate of bk lyn lying between @xmath45 yr@xmath1 and @xmath46 yr@xmath1 for the highest ( @xmath47 ) and lowest ( @xmath48 ) white dwarf mass respectively .",
    "it is likely that at this inclination , the white dwarf could be masked by the swollen disk .",
    "applying the same fitting procedures to v751 cygni , we found no combination of parameters in the accretion disk model grid which provided any acceptable agreement with the de - reddened ( e(b - v ) = 0.25 ) stis spectrum of v751 cygni .",
    "the only solution that even remotely resembled the stis spectrum ( but still in very poor agreement ) , is an accretion disk model with a white dwarf mass , m@xmath49 m@xmath38 , orbital inclination @xmath50 , a distance of only 78 pc , with an accretion rate of @xmath46 yr@xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath34 value for this fit is @xmath51 .",
    "increasing the dereddening value up to 0.5 decreases the distance even more .",
    "thus we are forced to conclude that there is no optically thick steady state disk model that fits the fuv spectrum of v751 cygni . in fig .",
    "4 , we display the stis spectrum of v751 cygni together with an accretion disk model that illustrates the extent of the disagreement between standard disk models and the observed data .",
    "unfortunately , the situation is only slightly better for v380 oph .",
    "we encountered the same difficulty finding acceptable fits .",
    "as stated earlier , this system also has the same inconsistency between the observed ly@xmath6 profile width and the observed continuuum slope as we found for v751 cyg .",
    "this led us to first explore the effect of interstellar reddening on v380 oph s spectrum . in our disk model fitting therefore we treated e(b - v ) as a free parameter .",
    "we found that for a color excess e(@xmath10 ) = 0.20 , the observed spectral slope and observed ly@xmath6 improved slightly but considerable inconsistency remained .",
    "as in the case of v751 cygni , we carried out disk model fits to v380 oph for every combination of m , inclination and white dwarf mass in our disk model library .",
    "the only model fit to the stis data that even slightly resembled ( but still in poor agreement with ) the stis spectrum was an accretion disk model alone . for e(@xmath10 ) = 0.20 , this closest but still rather poor fit corresponded to m@xmath52 m@xmath38 , @xmath53 = 75@xmath12 with @xmath35 = 1@xmath2610@xmath54 @xmath55 yr@xmath1 for a @xmath34 = 13.76 and a distance of 312 pc . in fig.5",
    ", we illustrate the extent of the disagreement between the stis spectrum of v380 oph and a standard accretion disk model .",
    "the fitting of the ly@xmath6 absorption feature has been achieved with the inclusion of the ism model .",
    "the ism model has an hydrogen column density of @xmath56@xmath43 , a turbulent velocity of 50km / s and a temperature of t=170k . without the ism model ( dashed line ) the disk model does not fit the bottom of the ly@xmath6 profile .",
    "it is clear that for v380 oph , a definite sw sex star , and for v751 cygni ( itself is a possible sw sex member ) , optically thick steady state accretion disk models simply can not be fit successfully to their fuv spectra .",
    "if one examines their fuv to optical spectral energy distribution , both v380 oph and v751 cygni look too red for a standard accretion disk sed in terms of uv - optical colour . on the other hand , such a conclusion may not apply to all definite sw sex stars .",
    "for example , we point out here that we have found that the fuv spectra of of two definite sw sex systems v442 oph and ah men in their high state do reveal reasonable agreement with steady state , optically thick disk models . in figures 6 and 7 , we display accretion disk fits to v442 oph and ah men from @xcite to illustrate this point .",
    "we note that while the disk fits are not perfect to these two sw sex stars , the results do suggest that for some sw sex stars , optically thick , steady state disk models do provide a fair representation of the fuv energy distribution and ly@xmath6 regions .",
    "\\(1 ) we obtained and analyzed the first fuv spectrum of bk lyn , the only confirmed nova - like variable known to be below the cv period gap .",
    "the spectrum is characterized by a steeply rising continuum toward shorter wavelengths together with strong broad emission features at c iii ( 1175 ) , nv ( 1240 ) , si iii + oi ( 1300 ) , c ii ( 1335 ) , si iv ( 1400 ) , c iv ( 1550 ) and weak he ii ( 1640 ) emission .",
    "as noted earlier , the emission lines and continuum slope in bk lyn s spectrum are similar in appearence to the hst and hut spectra of the dwarf nova ss cygni and to the fuv spectrum of v794 aql in its high state .",
    "the emission lines are presumed to have formed in an accretion disk present in the system at the time of our hst spectrum .",
    "a very narrow ly@xmath6 absorption feature is seen which is almost certainly due to interstellar hydrogen .",
    "no direct evidence of wind outflow in the form of p cygni - type profiles is seen in the hst spectrum .",
    "we find that bk lyn has an accretion rate in the range @xmath46yr@xmath1",
    "if @xmath57 and @xmath45yr@xmath1 if @xmath58 .    if mass transfer in cv systems below the period gap is driven by angular momentum loss due to gravitational wave emission alone , then the predicted accretion rate at an orbital period of 108 minutes is 5 @xmath26 10@xmath59 m@xmath38 yr@xmath1 ( howell , nelson & rappaport 2001 ) , a value much lower than the likely average accretion rate of a nova - like system like bk lyn .",
    "@xcite noted the peculiarity of bk lyn and stated that there was no way to fit the _",
    "hst_/stis spectrum of bk lyn with their accretion disk model .",
    "they pointed out that it is possible bk lyn has an optically thin disk with a very low accretion rate .",
    "however , they adopted a distance of only d=150pc ( presumably the average of sproat s distance of 114 pc and dhillon s distance of 185pc ) they determined an accretion rate of @xmath60yr@xmath1 . taking their low accretion rate , bk lyn should be a dwarf nova .",
    "however , an outburst has never been observed either by roboscope , rotse or by the aavso and vsnet .",
    "nova - like variables are generally associated with higher average mass transfer rates than dwarf novae .",
    "indeed , an examination of the white dwarf temperatures in cvs below the period gap are strongly clustered around 15,000k ( szkody et al.2003 , gaensicke et al .",
    "2004 ) with the hottest example being vw hyi with t@xmath61 = 20,000k . since there is as yet no evidence of low brightness states in bk lyn , the accretion rate may remain high for long intervals of time",
    "therefore , in view of the higher average mass transfer rate compared with dwarf novae below the gap , it would be most interesting to know if the underlying white dwarf s surface temperature , which is controlled by long term compressional heating , is hotter than the nominal 15,000k which is typical of white dwarfs in cvs below the gap .    for v751 cygni ,",
    "a vy scl - type nova - like , we carried out an analysis of the de - reddened hst stis spectrum and an archival iue spectrum obtained near maximum brightness , using the lower limit distance obtained by the @xcite method to help constrain the fits .",
    "the fact that the fuv spectrum is dominated by absorption features suggests that the inclination may be low .",
    "if , according to @xcite , it is i = 30 + /-",
    "20 degrees , then it is very likely that one is observing at least some fraction of the upper hemisphere of the white dwarf as well as the dominant luminous accretion disk .",
    "therefore , it would most interesting to gain an estimate of the white dwarf temperature .",
    "unfortunately , during the high state of a nova - like variable viewed at low inclination , the accretion disk light normally dominates and it is difficult to constrain the temperature of the accreting white dwarf without spectra such as those obtained with fuse , which extend down to the lyman limit where in some cases a disk and photosphere present distinguishable signatures .",
    "the slope of the continuum in v751 cygni is relatively flat even after the large de - reddening while the ly@xmath6 absorption is narrow .",
    "we were unable to find any optically thick , steady state accretion disk model that woiuld yield a satifactory fit to the stis spectrum of v751 cygni .",
    "therefore , we could not determine a reliable accretion rate for this system .",
    "as stated earlier , v751 cygni could turn out to be an sw sextantis subclass of nova - like variables .",
    "many such systems reveal reddish uv - optical spectral energy distributions and thus can not be fit with standard disk models .    for v380 oph , a definite sw sextantis nova - like system , the fuv spectrum is dominated by broad emission features , a relatively flat continuum and a narrow ly@xmath6 absorption feature .",
    "even with a reddening of e(b - v)= 0.2 and higher , our synthetic spectral analysis using standard accretion disk models was unable to derive a reliable accretion rate for v380 oph .",
    "this is another example of an sw sex star with a reddish uv - optical spectral energy distribution that can not be fit successfully with standard disk models . on the other hand ,",
    "as shown in figures 6 and 7 , there are some definite sw sex systems can be fit sucessfully with standard disk models . like v751 cygni , we can say little about the white dwarf in v380 oph during it high state without fuv spectra which extend down to the lyman limit",
    ". further determinations of accretion rates and , whenever possible , white dwarf temperatures are required to elucidate the role of sw sex stars and other nova - like variables in cv evolution .",
