    "these vector bundles were first constructed by tsuchiya , ueno , and yamada @xcite ; their ranks are computed by the famous verlinde formulae @xcite , @xcite .    in this work ,",

    "the morphisms determined by the conformal blocks bundles given by @xmath18 , level @xmath6 , and weights @xmath19 were shown by fakhruddin to factor through the contraction maps from @xmath0 to the weighted pointed moduli spaces defined by hassett ( @xcite*prop . 4.7 ) .",
    "we prove an analogous statement for conformal blocks bundles given by @xmath12 , level @xmath20 , and weights @xmath19 .",

    "[ gamma j ] , we give a formula for expressing any @xmath39-curve in that basis .",
    "this formula may be a useful tool for other purposes .",
    "we now say a few words about how we came to study the family of divisors @xmath41 .",
    "fakhruddin has recently found recursive formulas for the classes of general conformal blocks divisors on @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "swinarski implemented these formulas in a free and open source ` macaulay 2 ` @xcite package called ` confblocks ` @xcite , which can compute classes of conformal blocks divisors for many different lie algebras and levels .",
    "after some experimentation using the programs ` confblocks ` , ` nefwiz ` @xcite , and ` polymake ` @xcite , our group noticed that the divisors @xmath28 often spanned extremal rays of the nef cone .",
    "we also observed that many of the divisors @xmath28 lie in a part of the nef cone that was not previously well understood .",
    "more precisely : the ray theorem of keel and mckernan @xcite and its extension by farkas and gibney @xcite gives good understanding of the cone in @xmath42 generated by log canonical divisors . if a divisor @xmath23 is log canonical and intersects every @xmath39-curve nonnegatively , then @xmath23 is nef , and by @xcite , semiample .",
    "however , many of the divisors @xmath43 are not log canonical , and hence proving that they are nef and semiample requires different methods .",
    "we were also able to identify the images of the morphisms associated to some of the divisors @xmath28 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath7 is even , @xmath44 is the pullback of @xmath45 along a map @xmath46 , and hence this linear series maps @xmath0 to the satake compactification @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the image of the morphism associated to the divisor @xmath48 is the git quotient @xmath49 with the symmetric linearization @xcite .",
    "these examples piqued our interest in understanding the geometry of the morphisms associated to the divisors @xmath28 ; these morphisms have been studied further by giansiracusa ( cf .",
    "remark [ giansiracusa ] and @xcite ) .    in a related paper , alexeev , gibney , and swinarski study conformal blocks divisors @xmath50 for @xmath51 ,",
    "level @xmath6 , and weights @xmath52 when @xmath7 is even @xcite .",
    "we compare and contrast that paper and this one .",
    "one aspect of the divisors in the families @xmath53 and @xmath54 that makes them amenable to study is that we have good understanding of the ingredients which are needed to use fakhruddin s formulas for chern classes .",
    "specifically , the _ fusion rules _ , which give the ranks of the conformal blocks for @xmath55 marked points , are combinatorial and relatively easy if @xmath56 or if @xmath57 and @xmath58 . for general simple lie algebras and levels",
    ", the fusion rules can be much more complicated , making it correspondingly more difficult to obtain general formulas .    in order to study the @xmath51 divisors in @xcite",
    ", we needed to find a useful formula for the intersection of the divisors with @xmath39-curves .",
    "this required application of conformal blocks tools such as factorization . on the other hand , for the @xmath1 level @xmath20 divisors",
    ", fakhruddin gives a combinatorial formula for the intersection of the divisors with @xmath39-curves @xcite*5.2 .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that the @xmath51 divisors @xmath50 lie on the boundary of the symmetric nef cone , and that for all @xmath59 , four of these divisors span extremal rays of the symmetric nef cone .",
    "it was relatively easy to find sets of curves which intersect these divisors in degree zero and to prove independence of these families .",
    "in contrast , all of the @xmath1 divisors @xmath28 , @xmath60 span extremal rays of the symmetric nef cone . finding families of curves which these divisors intersect in degree zero and proving the independence of these families of curves was considerably more difficult in the @xmath1 case .",
    "so , although the divisors considered in the present paper and in @xcite are closely related , the types of results we needed to prove were different for the two families .    _ outline of the paper : _ in section [ background ] we establish the notation and conventions we will follow , giving basic definitions and references about conformal blocks bundles and @xmath0 . in section [ slnmorphisms ]",
    "we prove theorem [ thma ] on factoring morphisms through hassett spaces ; this section may be may be read independently of the rest of the paper . in section [ newtools ]",
    "we introduce some new tools for working with curves and divisors on @xmath0 ; the main result here is that we invert the matrix of intersection numbers between natural bases of symmetric divisors and symmetric curves on @xmath0 .",
    "this allows us to write divisors in the natural basis given their intersection numbers with @xmath39-curves .",
    "likewise , we may write an arbitrary symmetric @xmath39-curve class in the natural basis of symmetric curve classes . in section [ divisor classes ]",
    "we give explicit formulas for the intersection numbers and divisor classes of @xmath28 . in section [ special cases section ]",
    "we show that @xmath28 is extremal in the symmetric nef cone if @xmath61 or if @xmath62 . in section [ k geq 3 structure ]",
    "we define and study the family @xmath63 which is used to show the extremality of @xmath28 when @xmath64 , and in section [ k geq 3 independence ] we prove the extremality of @xmath16 in this case .",

    "however the birational geometry of @xmath0 is not completely understood and is known to be quite complicated .",
    "an important open question in algebraic geometry is to determine the nef cone of @xmath0 .",
    "recall that a divisor @xmath23 on a space @xmath24 is _ nef _",
    "if @xmath128 for every effective curve @xmath129 . the nef cone is the closure of the ample cone  those divisors that ( after taking suitably large multiples ) yield embeddings of @xmath24 in projective space .",
    "we define a cone @xmath130 called the @xmath39-cone as the cone of divisors which nonnegatively intersect the @xmath39-curves : @xmath131 in particular , every nef divisor must intersect the @xmath39-curves nonnegatively , so we have an inclusion @xmath132 . for @xmath133 ,",
    "this inclusion is an equality , but at the time of this writing , it is not known whether this inclusion is an equality for @xmath134 @xcite .",
    "the cone @xmath135 is combinatorially defined but intractable for large values of @xmath7 ; the picard number of @xmath0 is @xmath136 @xcite*p .",
    "thus for @xmath137 it is not practical to experiment with the full cone @xmath135 .",
    "this is one reason we are led to consider a smaller cone : let @xmath138 then @xmath139 contains the cone @xmath30 of @xmath2-symmetric nef divisors , and is much simpler since its ambient space is only @xmath4-dimensional , and there are fewer partitions of integers @xmath119 than partitions of the set @xmath89 .",
    "studying @xmath139 sheds light not only on @xmath0 , but also on @xmath140 : gibney , keel , and morrison showed that the birational geometry of @xmath141 is determined by the cone @xmath142 associated to @xmath143 @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will study nef divisors that span extremal rays of the cone @xmath139 . recall that the ambient vector space @xmath144 of @xmath86-symmetric divisors is @xmath4-dimensional .",
    "let @xmath145 be a family of @xmath146 independent @xmath39-curves @xmath147 .",
    "then @xmath145 determines a ray in @xmath144 given by the intersection of the hyperplanes @xmath148 .",
    "if this ray is spanned by a divisor which intersects all the @xmath39-curves nonnegatively , then this ray must be extremal in the @xmath39-cone @xmath139 .",
    "we also know that the divisors @xmath28 , being conformal blocks divisors , are nef .",
    "thus , since they are nef and span extremal extremal rays of @xmath139 , they span extremal rays of @xmath30 .",
    "here is an example :    let @xmath149 .",
