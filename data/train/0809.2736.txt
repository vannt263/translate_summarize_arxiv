    "the other two new terms @xmath64 and @xmath65 have a similar interpretation as large forward and backward hopping terms .",
    "we stress at this point , that the paths which the large hops consist of have a length of @xmath25 or longer , i.e. , they consist of at least @xmath25 individual steps .",

    "since @xmath80 and @xmath81 contribute a path that winds once in forward ( backward ) direction and @xmath78 does not wind at all , the sum @xmath104 is the winding number of the loop .",

    "let us finally discuss an important aspect of our result : we have noted above that the paths in the terms @xmath103 consist of at least @xmath4 steps . thus a contribution @xmath121 $ ] consists of closed loops which have at least a length of @xmath122 .",
    "long loops are suppressed exponentially in @xmath83 , due to the fluctuations of the gauge links and the factors of @xmath123 .",
    "obviously the sum over @xmath83 corresponds to a generalized hopping expansion .",
    "various aspects of our determinant factorization can be analyzed numerically .",
    "in particular we study the behavior of the factors @xmath55 and @xmath61 as a function of the mass parameter @xmath18 and the chemical potential @xmath36 . for our exploratory analysis",

    "the configurations were generated with the lscher - weisz gauge action @xcite and at the value of @xmath125 which we use here , the lattice spacing was determined @xcite to be @xmath126 fm .",
    "this gives rise to a cutoff of roughly 1 gev and corresponds to a temperature of 254 mev .",
    "as a first test we programmed both sides of the exact relation ( [ factorform ] ) in order to test the correct implementation of the terms in ( [ factordefs ] ) .",
    "we found agreement to machine precision .    in the actual analysis of the properties of the factorization formula we begin with evaluating the factors @xmath55 and @xmath61 ( see eq .",
    "( [ factordefs ] ) ) as a function of mass @xmath18 and chemical potential @xmath36 .",
    "we refer to @xmath55 as the _ bulk factor _ , while @xmath61 is the _ winding term _ of the determinant . for the numerical study we consider the mass values @xmath127 , and scan the chemical potential in the interval @xmath128 $ ] in steps of 0.01 .",
    "concerning the chemical potential we remark , that once the matrices @xmath129 are evaluated , it is very cheap to compute the @xmath36-dependent winding term @xmath61 for many values of @xmath36 .",
    "the reason is obvious from the definition of @xmath61 in the first line of ( [ tracelog ] ) , which shows that the determinant one has to evaluate is only over the indices of a single time slice .",
    "this dimensional reduction speeds up the numerical evaluation of the determinant considerably .",
    "to give an idea of the relative size of the different quantities , we show in table 1 the values of bulk factor @xmath55 together with the absolute values @xmath86|$ ] and @xmath130 for three different masses @xmath131 and 0.2 , for a single gauge configuration . note that @xmath55 is independent of @xmath36 , while @xmath86|$ ] and @xmath130 do depend on @xmath36 , and we thus give the latter two factors for three different values of the chemical potential , @xmath132 .",

    "furthermore @xmath55 strongly depends on the mass , while @xmath61 shows only a weak dependence .",
    "we thus conclude that the real valued bulk factor @xmath55 contributes the mass - dependent scale of the determinant , while @xmath61 brings in the @xmath36-dependence and the complex phase .",

    "we remark that the expansion which we have denoted here for a single flavor may easily be generated to an arbitrary number of flavors .",
    "having worked out the evaluation of the contributions in the individual winding sectors we now address the question of a suitable truncation scheme .",
    "obviously the @xmath188 are given by infinite sums ( see eq .",

    "[ delta1_plot ] we compare the outcome of the truncated determinant ( dashed curves ) to the exact result ( full curves ) .",
    "the comparison is done on a single gauge configuration for three different masses .",
    "the plot shows that already the @xmath194 approximation works surprisingly well . for most of the @xmath36-range",
    "the approximation falls exactly on top of the exact curve and only when @xmath36 reaches the cutoff at @xmath138 , deviations of the approximation ( dashed curve ) become visible . the onset of these deviations may be pushed to even higher @xmath36 by including larger @xmath84 in ( [ tqdeterminant ] ) , while still sticking to the @xmath198 approximation .",
    "for the quenched example studied here this is not necessary , since the deviation occurs only close to the cutoff .",
    "we repeated this analysis for several gauge configurations , and found the same quality of approximation throughout .",
    "thus we conclude that the truncation ( [ truncation ] ) together with the series expansion of section vi.b .",
    "provides a powerful method for computing the projected determinants @xmath172 .",
    "in this paper we have revisited the problem of finding the fermion determinant in a sector with a fixed quark number , i.e. , projecting to a fixed winding number of the closed loops the determinant consists of . in our approach",
    "we use a partition of the lattice into four domains and the determinant is expressed in terms of sub - determinants and propagators on the domains .",
    "the determinant can be organized in such a way that the winding numbers of the individual contributions can be accessed efficiently .",
    "our result allows for two different new approaches for computing the projected determinant at a fixed winding number : the factorization of the determinant dimensionally reduces the piece which depends on the chemical potential to a single time slice .",
    "thus the evaluation of the determinant for different values of the imaginary potential @xmath174 becomes considerably cheaper , and many more @xmath174-points can be used in the numerical fourier transformation to the determinant at fixed quark number .",
    "a second more direct approach is a power series expansion of the determinant , where the terms at fixed winding number appear as expansion coefficients .",
    "we propose a suitable truncation scheme for this expansion which we analyzed numerically .",
    "the method of a partition into domains may be used also for other applications . in particular",
    "it exists also for propagators and allows for the analysis of the winding numbers of the paths the propagators consist of .",
    "this might be useful for the recently proposed dual chiral condensate @xcite , where the fourier transform approach is used to define observables that are sensitive to chiral symmetry breaking as well as confinement .",
    "the domain factorization of therm propagator might also be combined with a pseudofermion representation of the fermion determinant and so open another approach to lattice qcd with chemical potential .",
