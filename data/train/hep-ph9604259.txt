    "in the last decade the great success was obtained in the study of the heavy quarkonium production and decay ( see , for example , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the investigation of the processes with the heavy quarks is based on the factorization hypothesis @xcite .",
    "the mass of heavy quark @xmath3 is much larger than the scale of strong interactions @xmath4 .",
    "so the presence of the small parameter @xmath5 has allowed one to separate the effects of small and long distances .",
    "the heavy hadron production amplitude may be presented as the product of the partonic part , which can be calculated using the perturbative qcd , and the nonperturbative factor , which describes the free quarks to final hadron transition . in the framework of the nonrelativistic quark model",
    ", this nonperturbative part can be presented through the quarkonium wave function at the origin @xmath6 , which is calculated using the potential method ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "so , the approach based on pqcd and nonrelativistic quark model is known as a nonrelativistic qcd ( nr qcd ) @xcite .",
    "the heavy hadron production via fragmentation prevails in the large transverse momentum region at @xmath7 and hadron colliders @xcite .",
    "recently it was shown @xcite that the fragmentation functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 for quark and gluon to split into a heavy quarkonium with fraction @xmath10 can be calculated within the framework of nr qcd .",
    "the fragmentation functions are the process independent and can be applied to the @xmath7 , photonic and hadronic production of heavy quarkonia . here",
    "we demonstrate that the nr qcd approach can be used for the calculation of the fragmentation function @xmath11 for heavy quark to split into double heavy baryon .",
    "the estimation of the production rates for baryons containing two heavy quarks was done recently on the basis of the quark - hadron duality @xcite as well as on the basis of the pqcd @xcite . in spite of the some differences , it was suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite , that the double heavy baryon production has two step . in the first stage",
    ", there is the heavy quark @xmath12 fragmentation into double heavy diquark @xmath13 in the colour octet state .",
    "the second step consists in the nonperturbative diquark fragmentation into a ( @xmath14 ) baryon .",
    "it was mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , that this mechanism of the fragmentation can be factorized into short and long distance contributions as the same in ref .",
    "the normalization of the fragmentation function @xmath11 is determined by the model dependent value of the @xmath13 diquark wave function at the origin @xmath15 as well as by the additional suggestion about nonperturbative diquark fragmentation mechanism into baryon .",
    "note , that the calculation of the @xmath6 for the colour object using potential model is nt grounded and destroys the factorization of the long and short distance effects .",
    "it was also suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the probability of the diquark @xmath13 fragmentation into baryon is equal to unity and the heavy diquark carries all of the momentum of the baryon @xmath16 .",
    "these circumstances raise too high the predicted values of the double heavy baryon production rates .",
    "the model of the quark - hadron duality , which was used in ref.@xcite for the prediction of @xmath0baryon production cross section at @xmath17factory , gives us the opportunity to obtain only upper limit of the production rates and does nt predict baryon spectra .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that all ( @xmath18)-pairs in the colour octet state with invariant mass from @xmath19 to @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is @xmath22-meson mass and @xmath23 gev ) split to the @xmath18-baryon . however , it is known @xcite that the phenomenological application of the quark - hadron duality method for heavy quarkonium photo- and hadroproduction needs to introduce additional process dependent @xmath24-factor which is equal to @xmath25 for description of the experimental data .",
    "therefore the results of refs . @xcite may be considered as a rough estimation of the double heavy baryon production rates , which need in more detail analysis .",
    "in the present paper we consider a new mechanism of the double heavy baryon production via heavy quark fragmentation based on the hypothesis of the point - like diquarks , which can be produced directly in the hard interactions of quarks and gluons at the short distance @xcite . as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the data on @xmath7 annihilation into hadrons do nt contradict to the existence of the very small diquark @xmath26 containing one heavy and one light quark . in such a way , the heavy quark ( @xmath27 ) can fragment directly into double heavy baryon spin-1/2 or -3/2 catching the scalar or the vector heavy diquark ( @xmath28 ) , correspondingly . in the process of the production quark - diquark system @xmath29 in the colour singlet state",
    "the relevant qcd scale satisfies to the next condition : @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the heavy diquark mass .",
    "this fact leads to the factorization of the double heavy baryon production amplitude .",
    "the transition of the @xmath29 into final baryon can be described using the nonrelativistic approximation of the potential model , because the system @xmath29 contains two heavy particles .",
    "so , for the calculation of the baryon ( @xmath32 ) wave function at the origin we have used equation @xcite , which effectively takes into account the relativistic effects of the kinematic nature @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 @xmath35[m^2-(m_q - m_d)^2]\\over{4m^2}}.\\ ] ] the potential of the quark - diquark interaction is taken in the conventional form @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 gev@xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "the results of our numerical calculations for the radial part of the wave function at the origin @xmath40 , are presented in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "the fragmentation function @xmath11 at the scale @xmath41 for the production of the baryon @xmath42 , containing the heavy quark @xmath12 and the heavy diquark @xmath26 , is given by the next expression : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the matrix element for the production of a baryon @xmath42 and antidiquark @xmath45 with the total four - momentum @xmath46 and the invariant mass @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the matrix element for the production of a quark @xmath12 with the same three - momentum @xmath49 .",
    "the lower limit in the integral ( 3 ) is @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the baryon mass , @xmath52 is the baryon transverse momentum in the reference frame where @xmath53 in the limit of @xmath54 : @xmath55    in the axial gauge associated with four - vector @xmath56 : @xmath57 the fragmentation contribution comes only from the feynman diagram for @xmath58 shown in fig.1 .",

    "at present time the form factors of the heavy diquarks are unknown and one has to assume a certain dependence on @xmath72 .",
    "the general consideration ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , based on asymptotic qcd picture and the phenomenology , predicts @xmath73 gev@xmath38 , corresponding to a very small heavy diquark .",
    "we try to take these points into account by using the simplest possible expressions for the heavy diquark form factors : @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "it has @xmath78 gev@xmath38 for @xmath79 diquarks and our parametrization is the same as in ref .",
    "note , that such choice of the diquark form factors gives opportunity to obtain the compact analytical expressions for the fragmentation functions .    in the case of the heavy quark fragmentation into spin-1/2 baryon it has fusion of the heavy quark @xmath12 and scalar diquark @xmath22 .",

    "the amplitude for heavy quark fragmentation into spin-3/2 baryon , corresponding to fusion of the heavy quark and the vector diquark , can be written as a sum of two parts , which are proportional to @xmath92 and @xmath93 form factors : @xmath94    @xmath95    @xmath96\\gamma,\\ ] ] @xmath97 @xmath98 ( \\hat q+m_q)\\gamma.\\ ] ] here , the spin - vector @xmath99 describes the spin-3/2 baryon in the final state and satisfies to the following conditions @xcite : @xmath100 @xmath101 in the case of the unpolarized spin-3/2 baryon the summing on the helicity states is carried out by means of the following formula : @xmath102",
    "substituting the amplitudes ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) to the basic formula ( 3 ) we have obtained the fragmentation functions for a heavy quark split into the spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 baryons . omitting the details of the calculation we write here final result for the heavy quark fragmentation function for spin-1/2 baryon : @xmath103 where @xmath104 @xmath105.\\ ] ] the fragmentation probability for the production of the spin-1/2 baryon is @xmath106 where @xmath107 @xmath108.\\ ] ]            the fragmentation function @xmath11 satisfies to the gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( glap ) evolution equations @xmath122 where @xmath123 the boundary condition on the evolution equation is the initial fragmentation function @xmath124 at the scale @xmath125 .",
    "note , that at leading order in @xmath126 one has : @xmath127 and the evolution equation implies that the fragmentation probability + @xmath128 does not evolve with the scale @xmath129 .",
    "therefore the fragmentation probability is the universal characteristic of the production rates .",
    "the evolution only changes the @xmath10-distribution to smaller values of @xmath10 .    the results of calculation for the fragmentation probabilities and the average values of the momentum fraction for @xmath12 quark to split into double heavy spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 baryons are shown in tables 1 and 2 .",

    "the fragmentation functions @xmath137 and @xmath138 , divided by the fragmentation probabilities , are shown in fig . 2 at @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "in the range of accuracy of our model the shape of @xmath139spectra for spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 baryons are the same one to other as well as @xmath139spectra for baryons with strange quark ( @xmath140 ) and without it ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "let compare our results with the estimation @xcite , where it was founded that fragmentation probabilities for heavy quark to split into double heavy baryons are @xmath142 independently on the baryon spin and the flavour content . in our approach",
    "the fragmentation probability depends on baryon spin and flavour .",
    "moreover , there is the relative growth of the production rates of the spin-3/2 baryons for @xmath143-quark fragmentation in comparison with the fragmentation of @xmath144-quark .",
