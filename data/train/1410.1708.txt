    "let us recall that the real dufresne laws are distributions on @xmath9 defined as follows : let @xmath10 and @xmath11 be in @xmath12 and @xmath13 and @xmath14 be two sequences of positive numbers .",
    "we write for @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 . as introduced in [ 3,6 ] , the dufresne law @xmath20 on @xmath21 ( if it exists ) is defined by its mellin transform : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is such that @xmath24 and @xmath25 are positive for all @xmath26 and @xmath27 for @xmath28 an example is given the beta distribution defined for @xmath29 and @xmath30 by @xmath31 where @xmath32 and which therefore can also be written as @xmath33 similarly for @xmath34 and @xmath35 the gamma distribution with scale parameter @xmath36 and shape parameter @xmath37 is the probability on @xmath9 defined by    @xmath38    is the dufresne distribution @xmath39 .",
    "let us now develop an extension to paragraph 5 in [ 3 ] :    let @xmath40 and @xmath41 be independent positive random variables such that @xmath5 has distribution @xmath42 ( i.e. is the distribution of product of two independent random variables @xmath43 ) and such that @xmath44 has distribution @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a positive real parameter . then @xmath41 and @xmath47 have the same distribution if and only if @xmath48 is the unique continuous solution for @xmath49 with @xmath50 of the following differential equation : @xmath51    * proof*. suppose that @xmath41 and @xmath52 have the same distribution and consider @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "the law of @xmath5 is : @xmath53\\ { \\bf 1}_{(0,1)}(t ) dt\\ ] ] if @xmath54 has the gamma distribution @xmath55 , we have @xmath56 and the functional equation can be written : @xmath57 leading to : @xmath58    we rewrite this as @xmath59 taking the derivative of both sides gives : @xmath60 and this easily leads to the differential equation ( 2.4 ) . to show",
    "the uniqueness of @xmath61 , an elementary way is to see that all other solution of ( 2.4 ) in a neighborhood of zero can be written as @xmath62 , where the unknown function @xmath63 satisfies @xmath64 since from ( 2.4 ) @xmath65 , it is easily seen that @xmath63 is continuous on 0 with @xmath66 iff @xmath63 is a constant .",
    "let us study first the case where @xmath67 . then the problem becomes a particular case of the dufresne result @xmath68 ( see proposition 3 in [ 3 ] see also [ 5 ] ) and the distribution of @xmath41 is @xmath69 .",
    "a direct proof of this result can also been obtained from the differential equation ( 2.4 ) , which becomes for @xmath67 : @xmath70 whose solutions can be calculated by the standard tools of hypergeometric differential equations . as noted in [ 3 ] the explicit expression of the dufresne distribution in terms of whittaker confluent hypergeometric function @xmath71 is : @xmath72 ( see erdelyi et al . 5.19 [ 8 ] , or gradsteyn and ryzhik 7.621(6 ) [ 11 ] ) .",
    "we now consider the more difficult case @xmath74 .",
    "proposition 12 in [ 3 ] was curiously involving the golden ratio @xmath75 . we extend it as follows :",
    "let @xmath40 and @xmath41 be independent positive random variables such that a has distribution @xmath42 and such that @xmath54 has distribution @xmath76 .",
    "then @xmath41 and @xmath77 have the same distribution if and only if @xmath41 has the distribution : @xmath78 where @xmath79 and the operation @xmath80 stands for an additive convolution of dufresne variables .",
    "* proof*. for @xmath81 the differential equation ( 2.4 ) becomes :    @xmath82    the characteristic equation of this differential equation relative to the singular point @xmath83 is @xmath84 , whose solutions are @xmath85 or @xmath86 . changing the function @xmath87 into the new unknown function @xmath88 defined by @xmath89 leads to the following hypergeometric differential equation for @xmath63 : @xmath90 whose unique solution continuous on @xmath91 and equal to @xmath36 on @xmath92",
    "is the gauss hypergeometric function : @xmath93 ( see rainville p. 54",
    "[ 12 ] ) . thus @xmath94 we know that the laplace transform of the dufresne distribution @xmath95 is @xmath96 and that the laplace transform of the distribution @xmath97 is @xmath98 : the result is proved .",
    "note that the positivity of the parameters is given by the condition @xmath99 , this condition shows the exchange of the product of two beta variates : @xmath42 is equivalent to @xmath100 .",
    "as a consequence , we get a possibly new identity for the generalized hypergeometric function @xmath101 .    for all integers @xmath102 we have the following identity : @xmath103    * proof*. with the notations of the previous proposition , we use the fact that @xmath104 .",
    "now the distribution of @xmath105 is @xmath106 , from proposition ( 2 ) and the convolution properties of the gamma distributions",
    ". we can now apply proposition 7 in [ 3 ] for computing the moments of @xmath107 and @xmath105 . since @xmath108",
    ", the corollary is proved .",
    "+ another consequence , where we get a possibly new integral formula for gauss hypergeometric functions , arises from the application of the laplace transform to the result .    if @xmath109 are positive , if @xmath110 and if @xmath111 is the gauss hypergeometric function then we have : @xmath112    * proof*. with the notations of the previous proposition , we use the fact that @xmath113 . now",
    "the laplace transform of the distribution of @xmath114 is @xmath115 from proposition 2 , from the convolution properties of the gamma function and since @xmath5 is the product of two independent @xmath43 the corollary is proved .",
    "in physics and in insurance mathematics ( see [ 5])the following process occurs : @xmath116 where the @xmath117 are the arrival dates of a poisson process with rate @xmath118 and the @xmath119 are i.i.d",
    ". random variables .",
    "@xmath120 represents , for example , the shot noise as in ref .",
    "the stationary limit of this process exists if @xmath121 and is the same as the distribution limit of the sequence of random variables @xmath122 defined by @xmath123 the @xmath124 being powers in @xmath125 of independent random variables uniform on @xmath126 $ ] .",
    "+ now consider a triggered shot noise with period k ( see [ 1,2,4 ] ) : @xmath127 the k sucessive poisson events are perturbating the exponential decay differently .",
    "the same arguments as in [ 9 ] show that the distribution limit of @xmath128 is given by the limit of @xmath129 , but the @xmath130 are independent with the same distribution as @xmath131 the @xmath132 being independent random variables uniform on @xmath126 $ ] which correspond to the studied cases @xmath133 where @xmath134 and the @xmath135 are @xmath136 or @xmath8 distributed .",
    "let @xmath40 and @xmath41 be independent positive random variables such that @xmath5 has distribution @xmath137 ( i.e. is the distribution of product of three independent random variables @xmath138 ) and such that @xmath44 has an exponential distribution @xmath139 . then @xmath41 and @xmath47 have the same distribution if and only if @xmath48 is the unique continuous solution for @xmath49 with @xmath50 of the following differential equation : @xmath140    * proof*. using the same arguments as in proposition ( 2 ) , we get @xmath141 from which after 3 differentiations we derive the differential equation .",
    "the problem again becomes a particular case of dufresne distribution @xmath142 since the differential equation is of generalized hypergeometric type with solution @xmath143 see [ 14 ] the parameters @xmath144 being the roots of the second order equation generated by the non linear system given by the identification of the parameters of equation ( 7.14 ) with those of the canonical equation in [ 14 ] .",
    "i.e. : @xmath145 and @xmath146 the roots are complex conjugate ( or real positive ) , @xmath147 the case @xmath148 has been studied by dufresne in [ 7 ] where he justifies the fact of having complex parameters for the product of beta distributions , such complex parameters have appeared already for the distribution of triggered shot noise [ 2 ] , it is easily verified that the real part and the module of the roots ( or the two real roots ) are greater than the elements of @xmath149 to build the laplace transform of a beta variable .",
    "+ products of @xmath150 betas could be handled in the same way , leading again to dufresne variables but with increasing complexity to calculate the parameters since for @xmath151 it will be necessary to use iterative numerical methods to solve the system of @xmath152 non - linear equations to evaluate the @xmath152 unknown parameters .",
    "for instance for @xmath153 the differential equation is : @xmath154 the solution is : @xmath155 the unkown parameters are the roots of the third order equation resulting from the 3 non linear equations due to the identification with the parameters of the fourth order hypergeometric equation given in [ 13]i.e . :",
    "@xmath156 @xmath157 @xmath158 there are 3 real positive roots or one real positive root and two complex conjugate roots which is allowed according to the dufresne results [ 7 ] the positivity being given by the descartes / laguerre rule of signs , see appendix . + for the case @xmath159 the solution is : @xmath160 the unkown parameters are the roots of the fourth order equation resulting from the 4 non linear equations due to the identification with the parameters of the fith order hypergeometric equation : @xmath161 @xmath162 @xmath163 @xmath164 there are 4 real positive roots or two real positive roots and two complex conjugate roots or two pairs of complex conjugate roots which is allowed according to the dufresne results [ 7],the positivity being given by the descartes / laguerre rule of signs , see appendix .",
    "the process could be extended by induction using an automatic procedure , the main difficulty being then for @xmath165 to get a good initial guess of the location of the solution of the non - linear system by an iterative method , for the sake of simplicity the choice of the set of @xmath166 components for the starting array of the real roots of the iteration process could be made since their positivity is assumed from the descartes / laguerre rule of signs and each real positive parameters @xmath167 must be greater than one of the associated @xmath168 to build the laplace transform of a beta variable .",
    "otherwise the calculations could be made sequentially : set the parameters @xmath169 in increasing order @xmath170 compute the n roots starting the iterations with the initial guess @xmath171 and then @xmath172 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath173 then @xmath174 ( using wolframalpha ) equivalent results have been tested which show that the special case : equality to 1 of the all the parameters gives a set of real integer coefficients for a quasi cyclotomic polynomial , the roots are the roots of unit ( the real root 1 is lacking ) the unit circle being centered at @xmath175 on the complex plane ( c++ program available on request , see also sloane [ 14 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding cycltomic polynomial is the following according to the identity [ 13 ] : @xmath176 an extension to the case @xmath177 gives the roots on the circle of radius @xmath178 centered at @xmath179 in the complex plane .",
    "this extension due to the generalization of the relation of theorem 1.1 in [ 13 ] @xmath180 for instance if @xmath181 the polynomial is @xmath182 the roots are @xmath183 on the circle of radius 2 centered at @xmath184 the real root @xmath185 is lacking see figure.if all the parameters are equal to @xmath186 at the limit @xmath187 tending to infinity it can be conjectured that the result is degenereted to a circle point of radius @xmath186 centered at @xmath188 showing an infinite product of @xmath189 .",
