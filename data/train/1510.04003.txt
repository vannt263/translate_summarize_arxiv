    "two - dimensional structures made by complicated macromolecules are recently of great interest due to their potential applications , mainly in photoelectronic and biosensor area @xcite . in contrast to assemblies of spherical objects like , for instance , colloidal or nanosilica spheres , in case of anisotropic or irregularly shaped particles , there is a possibility to realize monolayers exhibiting very regular patterns which , next , can be utilized as a matrix capable to orient liquid crystal or to fabricate elements of electronic devices @xcite .",
    "it has also turned out that the structure of a matrix built within a monolayer may influence the activity of biomolecules .",
    "this biomolecular effect is a first step for biosensors construction .",
    "a comprehensive and detailed report about ordered molecular assemblies formed by langmuir - blodgett films and self - assemblies with potential influence on biosensing capabilities is given in @xcite .",
    "achiral bent - core ( banana ) shaped molecules can be important in this regard @xcite .",
    "this arises from the observation of extraordinary self - organization in these mesogens in 3d , like the twist - bent nematic phase of nanoscale pitch @xcite , the fibre forming smectic twist - bent phase @xcite and the cybotactic nematic phase @xcite .",
    "they are also promising candidates to form the elusive biaxial nematic phase @xcite , the splay - bend nematic phase ( @xmath0 ) @xcite and even more complex structures with tetrahedratic order @xcite .    in 2d",
    "the situation is more subtle .",
    "these systems are generally characterized by the lack of true long range order in the nematic state , which is a consequence of director s fluctuations .",
    "a continuous nematic - isotropic phase transition goes here via kosterlitz - thouless disclination unbinding mechanism yielding what is observed as algebraically decaying orientational pair correlation function in the nematic phase @xcite .",
    "it is observed , for example , in simulations of a 2d system of hard needles with zero thickness @xcite , for planar hard rods @xcite and for zig - zag and bow - shaped hard needles @xcite . even though the true long - range nematic order does not exist in these systems on a macroscopic scale",
    "the simulations show that it persists over large spatial dimensions ( _ i.e. _ on a mesoscopic scale ) .",
    "interestingly , it can be well described by means of the onsager s density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite , despite the fact that macroscopic fluctuations of the director are generally not included in dft .    on the experimental side",
    "the data of gong and wan @xcite for banana - shaped liquid crystal molecules ( p - n - pimb ) deposited on a highly orienting pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) surface reveal that the nematic order can be nearly saturated over the sample . using scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm )",
    "the authors observed here several antiferroelectric chiral and nonchiral lamellar structures .",
    "antiferroelectric smectic order in dense 2d banana systems has been also discussed theoretically as prevailing in @xcite by bisi _",
    "based on the packing arguments and , later , by gonzales _",
    "_ in the case of needle - like , infinitely thin boomerangs @xcite and hockey stick - shaped molecules consisting of two line segments @xcite .",
    "it has been also detected in zero - thickness zig - zag and bow - shaped systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , in @xcite the authors have observed that upon increasing pressure , before the system attains antiferroelectric smectic a phase , a spatially non - uniform , bend - deformed polar domains with the overall zero net polarization are being formed .    understanding molecular self - organization in thin layers of more realistic , _ finite - thickness _ bent - core molecules is an interesting theoretical issue .",
    "since most studies on two - dimensional systems are based on the particles exhibiting geometrical shapes like needles @xcite , hard discorectangles @xcite , or zigzag particles @xcite interacting via hard core potentials , we will also incorporate a model from this class ( it will be discussed in detail later ) .",
    "both types of approach - mc simulations and onsager s density functional theory ( dft ) - give consistent predictions here .",
    "of particular importance on the phase stabilization are excluded volume effects due to primary molecular features of the particles . in the case of bananas",
    "these features are : length and width of the arms and the apex angle . as it will be shown , the secondary features like _",
    "e.g. _ the shape of the arm s end contribute to quantitative changes .    as already mentioned above the dft of onsager s type",
    "has proven to give a good insight into qualitative features of the phases .",
    "one of the benefits of using the dft scheme in connection with bifurcation and symmetry analyses is the fact that it allows to cover a broad range of cases giving clear directions for a more detailed study .",
    "the theory predicts the existence of the ordered mesophases with weakly first or second - order phase transitions in 2d systems , and hence can not predict quasi long - range order ( qlro ) , which is characteristic for systems with a continuous broken symmetry .",
    "even though the onsager s dft does not account for qlro , it works surprisingly well for nonseparable , hard body interactions @xcite .",
    "indeed , a comparison of the onsager dft with mc simulations suggest that the former theory is able to account for relevant features of molecular self - organization @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate with the onsager s dft a possibility of structure formation in monolayers built from hard bent - core molecules of zero- and finite thickness .",
    "in particular we show that a change in molecular shape can have a profound effect on the properties and even stability of the structures .",
    "we mainly limit ourselves to the case of high orientational order , in agreement with experiment @xcite and previous 2d studies @xcite , but supplement the dft analysis with a full monte - carlo simulation to support validity of the approximation used .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii presents the model and section iii introduces the onsager s dft formalism together with the appropriately identified order parameters , needed for the structure description of aligned boomerangs .",
    "section iv gives the results of the bifurcation analysis for @xmath0 and lamellar structures .",
    "section v provides exemplary phase diagrams obtained from the full minimization for three different bent - core systems : hard needle - like bananas , finite thickness bananas with flat horizontal edges and finite thickness bananas with squared edges .",
    "finally , in the last section a summary is given together with the main conclusions .",
    "we are going to study molecular self - organization in a two - dimensional system of hard bent - core molecules of finite thickness .",
    "three types of molecules will be studied : needle - like boomerangs , fig .",
    "( [ fig01_trzyksztalty]a ) , finite thickness boomerangs with horizontally cut edges ( hb ) , fig .",
    "( [ fig01_trzyksztalty]b ) , and finite thickness boomerangs with squared edges ( sb ) , fig .",

    "( [ fig01_trzyksztalty]a ) , are just two line segments of the length @xmath1 joined at one end in such a way that they form the apex angle of @xmath2 . to obtain a hb molecule",
    "the line segments are replaced by rhomboids whose tilt angle conforms to the assumption that the edges are effectively horizontal as in fig .",
    "( [ fig01_trzyksztalty]b ) .",
    "the sb molecules will differ from the hb molecules with respect to the shape of the arm edges , which in the sb case are squared .",
    "@xmath3 describes here the arm s thickness .",
    "we should add that we sought for several possibilities of introducing finite thickness to needle - like boomerangs .",
    "the sb molecules seem to be the most natural extension , whereas boomerangs with horizontally cut arms ( the hb particles ) are expected to attain a layered arrangement more easily . indeed , for the hb systems even close packing arrangements correspond to lamellar order with polarized layers .",

    "<S> two - dimensional ensembles of bent - core shaped molecules attain at highly orienting surfaces liquid crystalline structures characteristic mostly for lamellar chiral or nonchiral antiferroelectric order . here , using the onsager - type of density functional theory supplemented by constant - pressure monte - carlo ( mc ) simulation we investigate the role of excluded - volume interactions in stabilizing different structures in monolayers filled with bent - shaped molecules . </S>",
    "<S> we study influence of molecular features , like the apex angle , thickness of the arm and the type of the arm edges on the stability of layered structures . for simple molecular shapes taken the observed phases are dominated by the lamellar antiferroelectric type as observed experimentally , but a considerable sensitivity of the ordering to details of the molecular shape is found for order parameters and wave vectors of the structures . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , for large opening angles and not too thick molecules a window of stable nematic splay - bend phase is shown to exist . </S>",
