    "the globular cluster m54 ( ngc6715 ) is a special object under several aspects . in fact",
    ", it is quite massive ( @xmath5 , pryor & meylan 1993 ) , it displays a complex horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology ( extending up to the highest temperatures achievable by these stars ; rosenberg et al .",
    "2004 ) and its stars present an intrinsic spread in iron abundances ( carretta et al .",
    "2010 , c10 hereafter ; see bellazzini et al . 2008 , hereafter b08 , for previous studies and references ) .",
    "moreover , it resides at the center of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( sgr dsph ; ibata , gilmore & irwin 1994 ) , a satellite of the milky way that is currently disrupting under the tidal strain of the galaxy ( see , for example , majewski et al .",
    "several authors suggested the possibility that m54 could be the nucleus of sgr ( bassino & muzzio 1995 ; sarajedini & layden 1995 ) .",
    "later studies ( layden & sarajedini 2000 ; majewski et al . 2003 ; monaco et al .",
    "2005a ) , however , demonstrated that the metal - poor cluster ( [ fe / h]@xmath6 ; brown , wallerstein & gonzalez 1999 , c10 ) co - exists with a stellar nucleus made of metal rich stars of the sgr galaxy ( @xmath7\\rangle\\simeq -0.45 $ ] ; b08 and references therein ) .",
    "a recent study based on accurate velocity and metallicity data ( b08 ) strongly supports the idea that m54 formed independently , and plunged into the sgr nucleus as a result of significant decay of its original orbit due to dynamical friction ( monaco et al . 2005b ; see also c10 for independent support to this hypothesis ) .    in this context , rr lyrae ( rrl ) variables can provide further insight into the nature of this stellar system , in addition to reliable estimates of the distance and foreground extinction .",
    "the first ( photographic ) survey for variable stars in m54 was performed by rosino & nobili ( 1959 ) who identified 82 variables .",
    "their pioneering analysis was followed up and expanded by layden & sarajedini ( 2000 ; ls2000 hereafter ) , who considered the variables as part of their v , i ccd photometric study aimed at obtaining the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of m54 + sgr field to derive the star formation history of the sgr dsph galaxy . in that work ls2000 found 117 variable stars , 93 of which are candidate rrl stars .",
    "they analysed the best observed subset of rrl ( 67 stars ) to obtain a distance modulus of @xmath8 and e(v - i)=@xmath9 .",
    "on the basis of the pulsational properties of their sample of rrl , these authors classified m54 as an oosterhoff type i cluster ( oosterhoff 1939 ; see catelan 2009 for a recent review ) .",
    "in this paper we present new bvi photometric data and discuss in detail the characteristics of the rrl stars of m54 , that were presented in preliminary form by cacciari , bellazzini & colucci ( 2002 ) . in sect .",
    "2 we describe our data , the observations , the data reduction , the calibration procedure and the period search procedure . in sect .",
    "3 we present and briefly discuss the characteristics of the cmd resulting from our photometric data and present our sample of detected variables . in sect .",
    "4 we analyze the rrl pulsational properties and use them to estimate their membership to the m54 or sgr stellar population .",
    "5 presents the results of the fourier analysis of the rrl light curves and metallicity estimates .",
    "the reddening and distance are derived in sect .",
    "6 , and the properties of the other variables of our sample are briefly presented and discussed in sect .",
    "we summarize and discuss our results in sect . 8 . in appendix",
    "a we comment on individual variables .",
    "the bvi photometric data presented in this paper were obtained on 13 , 14 and 19 july 1999 at the eso - danish 1.54-m telescope in la silla ( chile ) using the 2k@xmath102k ccd of the danish faint object spectrograph and camera ( dfosc ) .",
    "the images cover a @xmath11 field of view roughly centered on m54 , with a scale of 0.39 @xmath12/pixel .",
    "the bvi images were taken sequentially with exposure times of 360 - 900 sec in b , 150 - 600 sec in v , and 150 - 450 sec in i , depending on the atmospheric conditions .",
    "the average seeing during the three nights ranged between @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( fwhm ) . in total , it was possible to obtain 54 b , 57 v and 52 i images .",
    "the frames were overscan corrected , bias subtracted and flat fielded ( using twilight sky flats ) by means of the standard iraf tasks .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the isis package ( alard 2000 ) , which is based on the method of image subtraction .",
    "isis is able to transform a series of images of the same field to ( a ) the same astrometric system , ( b ) the same flux scale , and ( c ) the same point spread function ( psf ) , without flux losses .",
    "once all the above transformations have been performed , the data reduction proceeds as follows :    1 .   a high signal - to - noise reference frame ( per filter ) is constructed , by stacking a suitable number of images ; in the present case the reference frames were built by stacking 14 b , 15 v and 14 i frames . 2 .",
    "each individual image is subtracted from the reference frame ; the squares of the images of the residuals are co - added into a single image where there are only the variable sources .",
    "variable stars are identified on the stacked images of the residuals and their positions are recorded .",
    "the residual flux is measured on each single subtracted image at the position of the detected variables , using a psf fitting routine .",
    "a light curve in units of flux difference is obtained for each variable .",
    "photometry of the reference frames is obtained independently ( in our case using dophot ; schechter , mateo & saha 1993 ) to provide the flux zero point to the light curves ( and convert into a scale of magnitudes ) . in our case",
    "we transformed the instrumental magnitudes obtained with dophot into absolute johnson - cousins magnitudes using several hundreds of stars in common with the photometry by ls2000 ( for v and i ) and by rosenberg , recio - blanco & garcia - marin ( 2004 ) for b magnitudes .",
    "the image - subtraction technique has proven very powerful in detecting even low amplitude variables in crowded fields , ensuring a higher accuracy in relative photometry with respect to traditional techniques ( see e.g. olech et al .",
    "1999 ; mochejska et al .",
    "2004 ; corwin et al . 2006 ; greco et al . 2009",
    "; we refer to these papers also for further details on the technique ) . as an example , in fig .",
    "[ f : compar ] we show for comparison the v light curves of 3 rrl variables in m54 that were measured by ls2000 with traditional techniques ( dophot ) and by us with isis : the higher quality of the new light curves is readily evident .",
    "there are two additional features of the specific application of the method performed in the present case that deserve to be described :    * the images of a few bright foreground stars were saturated in our frames . in the process of image subtraction",
    "these sources left spurious residuals due to different degree of saturation in the different frames , blooming etc .",
    "this in turn led to the identification of large numbers of spurious variable sources in the surroundings of these saturated stars . to remove contaminants from the list of variables before obtaining their light curves",
    ", we masked the surroundings of heavily saturated stars .",
    "the dimension of the masked areas was decided case by case , by inspecting the stacked image of the residuals .",
    "* dophot automatically masks the regions surrounding ( even moderately ) saturated stars and/or sources for which the psf fit does not reach convergency .",
    "for this reason there are variable stars for which we obtain a good differential flux light curve from isis but are not measured by dophot on the reference image .",
    "hence they lack a zero - point and their light curves can not be transformed into a magnitude scale . for these stars we can not measure an absolute amplitude , but we can obtain reliable periods and classify them on the basis of their periods , the shape of the light curve and the similarity of the differential flux amplitudes with calibrated variables .          for the period search , we used the graphical analyzer of time series ( gratis ) program ( see clementini et al .",
    "2000 for details ) , which was run on the isis differential flux data .",
    "this code ( developed by p. montegriffo at the osservatorio astronomico di bologna ) employes two different algorithms : ( 1 ) a lomb periodogram ( lomb 1976 ) and ( 2 ) a best fit of the data with a truncated fourier series ( barning 1963 ) .",
    "the adopted period search procedure performs the lomb analysis on a wide period interval .",
    "the fourier algorithm refines the period definition and find the best - fitting model .",
    "the r.m.s . of the observed points about the best fit model",
    "is taken as the error associated to the mean magnitudes .",
    "this value is reported along with the photometric data for each variable in table 1 .",
    "the x , y coordinates in pixels have been transformed into j2000 equatorial coordinates with a second order polynomial fitted to @xmath15 stars in common with 2mass ( skrutskie et al 2006 ) , that were used as astrometric standards .",
    "the residuals of the adopted astrometric solution were @xmath16 r.m.s . in both ra and dec",
    "in fig . [ cmd ] the v-(b - v ) and v-(v - i ) cmds obtained with dophot from the reference bvi images are shown .",
    "the cmd reaches a limiting magnitude of @xmath17 sampling the population of m54 and sgr down to @xmath18 2 magnitudes below the cluster main sequence turn - off .",
    "the vertical plume of stars at @xmath19 is composed by foreground / background galactic main sequence stars at various distances along the line of sight . the steep and narrow red giant branch ( rgb ) of m54 is clearly visible , bending from @xmath20 at @xmath21 to @xmath22 at @xmath23 .",
    "the wider ( and sparser ) rgb of sgr runs nearly parallel to the red of the m54 one . a well - defined blue hb ( mostly associated to m54 ;",
    "see monaco et al .",
    "2004 ) and a well populated red clump ( associated to sgr ) are also visible at v@xmath1818.2 . a detailed discussion of the cmd is out of the scope of the present paper ; we address the interested reader to papers more focused on the interpretation of the cmd ( sarajedini & layden 1995 ; monaco et al . , 2003 , 2004 , and references therein )",
    "for a detailed analysis of the stellar content in the innermost region of the cluster , see the exquisite cmd obtained by siegel et al .",
    "( 2007 ) from hubble space telescope data . for the purposes of the present analysis , it is important to recall that within the limiting radius of m54 ( @xmath24 ; see ibata et al .",
    "2009 ) , the surface density of the cluster is nearly everywhere a factor of 7 - 8 larger than the sgr metal - rich nucleus ( b08 ) .",
    "moreover , the population of the sgr nucleus is dominated by intermediate - age stars that are unlikely to evolve into rrl ( siegel et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) producing a fraction of rrl which should be much lower than in m54 ( monaco et al . 2004 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with cseresnjes ( 2001 ) , who estimated a density of 139 rr0 per square degree in the central region of sgr , leading to about 6.5 rr0 in our 13 arcmin square field of view .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the sample of rr lyrae assembled in the present study must be dominated by members of m54",
    ".      our photometric search allowed us to identify 177 variable stars ( 94 new discoveries ) , significantly increasing the number ( 117 ) of variables identified by the previous studies of rosino & nobili ( 1959 ) and ls2000 .",
    "the identification and photometric information are given in table 1 .",
    "in fig . [ cmdvar ] the variables detected in this study are identified in the v-(b - v ) cmd .    among the 89 stars studied by ls2000 :",
    "2 ( v23 and v91 ) were not identified in the present study because they lie out of our fov ; 4 ( v25 , v108 , v111 and v112 ) were not identified because they were masked out during the variable detection phase ( see sect .",
    "[ s : dr ] ) ; 4 ( v86 , v89 , v90 and v95 ) were identified as variables but no light curve could be derived and one ( v100 ) was found to be non variable . of the variables reported in the former study of rosino & nobili ( 1959 ) 5 of them ( v21 , v26 , v73 , v79 and v81 ) were not identified , neither by us nor by ls2000 , because no stars were detected at the locations indicated by rosino & nobili ( 1959 ) and 5 ( v20 , v22 , v27 , v53 and v72 ) were found to be non variable ( as also found by ls2000 ) .",
    "these stars are not listed in table 1 .",
    "finally , 18 stars were identified and analysed using only internally calibrated photometry ; they do appear in table 1 but no photometric information is provided .",
    "the agreement between the light curves and the estimated periods between us and ls2000 is very good , in general .",
    "a few discordant cases are discussed in appendix a.    for the 61 variable stars of the ls2000 sample for which we have calibrated photometry , we obtained light curves and derived the ephemerides using ls2000 photometric data in combination with ours to obtain a longer time baseline and more accurate results .",
    "for the 94 newly identified variables ( v118-v211 ) we derived the classification and the periods .",
    "we found : 51 rr0 , 29 rr1 , 3 sx phoenicis , 3 w uma ( ew ) , one algol binary ( ea ) , 4 long period ( lp ) candidates ( with no period determination ) and 3 with uncertain classification ( v145 , v147 and v211 ) of which two ( v147 and v211 ) might be eclipsing binaries ( eb ) . from the present calibrated data we find no evidence of double - mode pulsation in any of the studied stars . for 58 of these stars ,",
    "mostly located in the central region of m54 , the photometry could not be externally calibrated for the reasons described in sect .",
    "[ s : dr ] .",
    "the light curves of a sample of newly discovered rrl and other variables are shown in fig.s [ lc_rrlyr ] and [ lc_other ] .",
    "the epoch photometry for all the variables with calibrated photometry is available in its entirety at the cds .    in the following",

    "( 2004 ; @xmath95 ) , and by ls2000 , once their estimate is corrected using the most recent metallicity estimates ( @xmath96 ; see monaco et al .",
    "a significantly smaller distance ( @xmath97 ) has been derived by kunder & chaboyer ( 2009 ) on the basis of the analysis of differential distance modulus of a sample of sgr rrl with respect to a sample of rrl belonging to the galactic bulge .",
    "these authors adopt a different luminosity - metallicity relation ( from bono , caputo & di criscienzo 2007 ) , and their sample is affected by larger amount of extinction ( e(b - v)=0.36 ) , lying in fields at lower galactic latitude , from @xmath98 to @xmath99 apart from m54 .",
    "moreover , the derived distance clearly depends on the assumed distance to the galactic bulge .",
    "finally , a lower distance in that wing of the sgr dsph may be a real effect of the three dimesional orientation of the galaxy major axis .",
    "all these factors can contribute to account for the difference between their distance estimate and our results ( as well as those by ls2000 and monaco et al .",
    "2004 ; see the latter paper for a detailed discussion and references on previous distance estimates ) .",
    "apart from the rrl , a number of other variables have been found in the present survey .",
    "variables v1 and v2 are cepheids already discovered by rosino & nobili ( 1959 ) and classified by ls2000 as a population ii and an anomalous cepheid , respectively .",
    "their magnitudes are consistent with those predicted by the period - luminosity relation of nemec , nemec & lutz ( 1994 ) and are located at 3.2 and 3.5 arcmin from the cluster center , respectively . on the basis of these considerations they should be likely members of m54 ( or sgr dsph ) .",
    "among eclipsing binaries , stars v116 and v195 are algol binaries ( ea ) , whereas v147 and v211 are suspected eb types .",
    "five variables ( namely v99 , v117 , v134 , v135 , and v144 ) are probably w uma ( ew ) . by applying the period - colour - v luminosity relations by rucinski ( 2000 ) we estimated the distance moduli of these stars . among these 5 stars , only v134 and v144 have distance moduli @xmath100 which are compatible with that of m54 estimated in sect . [",
    "s : dist ] , being probable cluster members .",
    "we found 3 sx phoenicis variables ( v146 , v149 and v150 ) with periods in the range @xmath101 . adopting the period - luminosity relation by poretti et al .",
    "( 2008 ) we estimated the distances for these stars . v146 and v149 are significantly less distant than m54 ( @xmath102 mag ) and are likely foreground galactic variables .",
    "the distance modulus of v150 is compatible ( within 0.3 mag ) with that of m54 and could be a cluster or sgr member .    finally , we identified 18 candidate long - period variables ( lpv ) .",
    "four of them ( v153 , v154 , v155 and v156 ) are new discoveries .",
    "they are located in the cmd close to the tip of the rgb at colours @xmath103 ( see fig .",
    "[ lpv ] ) .",
    "most of them are located far from the rgb ridge line of m54 , on the expected locus of late m giants of sgr , being likely associated to sgr .    of course , the short time coverage of our observations does not allow us to establish their pulsation periods and their average magnitudes and colours are uncertain .",
    "we presented a survey of variable stars in a 13 arcmin square field of view centred on the gc m54 using deep multi - epoch observations collected with the eso - danish 1.54 m telescope . from this analysis we detected 177 variables , 94 of them never observed before .",
    "we provide the ephemerides for the entire sample of variables ( except for 18 long - period candidates ) , and the epoch - photometry and light curves for the large subset of variables with calibrated photometry .",
    "the period - amplitude diagram of the rrl of m54 and the relative fraction of rr1 variables indicate that this cluster shares some of the properties of oosterhoff i clusters ( as already found by ls2000 ) , but contains a larger number of long - period variables .",
    "the average period of its rr0 and rr1 stars are indeed slightly larger than typical oosterhoff i cluster values , even if significantly smaller than oosterhoff ii .",
    "accurate estimates of the cluster reddening ( @xmath82 ) and distance modulus ( @xmath92 ) were also derived , in excellent agreement with previous estimates in literature .",
    "the metallicity distribution of the rrl , derived through the fourier parameter @xmath57 , shows a clear peak at the metallicity of m54 ( @xmath58 \\sim -1.65 \\pm 0.16 $ ] dex ) and a few stars with a significantly different metallicity ( outside the range @xmath69<-1.2 $ ] ) , likely associated with the population of the sgr dsph .",
    "the presence of a extended blue hb ( reaching the instability strip ) associated with the sgr galaxy has been already discovered by monaco et al .",
    "we note that the presence of rrl stars as metal - rich as @xmath58\\ga -0.8 $ ] ( see also cseresjnes 2001 ) , if confirmed , would indicate that sgr was able to reach such relatively high metallicity at a very early epoch ( @xmath104 gyr ago ) .",
    "unfortunately , the small number of stars belonging to this group and the large uncertainties in the metallicities do not allow a firm conclusion on this issue until spectroscopic confirmation is obtained .",
    "this work is largely based on the master thesis of by s. colucci ( 2000 ) , at the bologna university .",
    "we warmly thank christine clement , the referee of our paper , for her helpful comments and suggestions that have helped us improve the paper significantly .",
    "we also thank alfred rosenberg for providing his photometric catalog of m54 that was used for the calibration of the b photometry .",
