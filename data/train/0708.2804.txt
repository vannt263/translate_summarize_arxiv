    "in 1998 , alamouti  @xcite invented a remarkable scheme for multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) transmission using two transmit antennas and admitting a low - complexity maximum - likelihood ( ml ) decoder .",
    "time block codes ( stbcs ) using more than two transmit antennas were designed in  @xcite . for such codes , ml decoding is achieved in a simple way , but , while they can achieve maximum diversity gain  @xcite , their transmission rate is reduced . the _ quasi - orthogonal _ stbcs in  @xcite can support a transmission rate larger than orthogonal stbcs , but at the price of a smaller diversity gain . using algebraic number theory and cyclic division algebras ,",

    "independently , the same codes were found in  @xcite .",
    "more recently , another family of full - rate , full - diversity , fast - decodable @xmath0 codes for mimo was proposed in  @xcite .",

    "the present paper provides a unified view of the fast - decodable stbcs in  @xcite for @xmath0 mimo .",
    "we show that all these codes allow the same low - complexity ml decoding procedure , which we specialize in the form of a sphere - decoder ( sd ) search  @xcite .",
    "we also derive general design criteria for full - rate , fast - decodable stbcs , and we use it to design a family of @xmath1 codes based on a combination of algebraic and quasi - orthogonal structures . in this case , the full - diversity assumption is dropped in favor of simplified maximum - likelihood decoding . within this family , we exhibit a code that outperforms all previously proposed @xmath2 stbcs for @xmath3-qam signal constellation .    the balance of this paper is organized as follows .",
