    "in the past few years , high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) has been extensively studied as a tool for attosecond imaging .",
    "in particular the possibility of bound - state reconstruction @xcite , the attosecond probing of dynamic processes in molecules @xcite and quantum interference effects @xcite has attracted a great deal of attention .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that hhg is the result of the recombination of an electron , freed by tunneling or multiphoton ionization at an instant @xmath6 , with its parent molecule at a later instant @xmath7 @xcite . since",
    ", in principle , the electron may recombine with more than one center , high - harmonic emission at spatially separated sites takes place . hence , information about the structure of the molecule in question is hidden in the hhg spectrum . in particular for diatomic molecules , this can be thought of as a microscopic counterpart of the double - slit experiment , in which maxima and minima arise due to the two - center interference @xcite .    in many studies",
    "so far , it has been assumed that the electron is released from the highest - occupied molecular orbital ( homo)@xcite . this , however , has been disputed in recent investigations , in which it was shown that multielectron effects and the quantum interference of different ionization channels may play an important role @xcite .",
    "such effects may constitute a serious obstacle towards ultra - fast molecular imaging .",
    "apart from that , even if only the homo is considered as the initial state of the ionized electron , in many cases its degeneracy has a considerable influence on the hhg spectra @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the influence of different molecular orbitals on the high - order harmonic spectra of diatomic nitrogen @xmath8 .",
    "high - order harmonic generation @xcite and above - threshold ionization @xcite in @xmath2 have been extensively investigated in the literature , as , due to its large mass , its vibrational degrees of freedom do not play a very important role and may be ignored to first approximation .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that , whereas for lighter species , vibration may lead to a considerable blurring of the two - center interference patterns , and a reduction in the high - harmonic or photoelectron yield , for molecular nitrogen such effects are not significant @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in @xmath9 the homo and the homo-1 orbitals are energetically very close .",
    "this has several consequences .",
    "first , since they possess opposite parity , one expects a strong coupling between them .",
    "second , since the tunneling probability is related to the bound - state energy , the processes in which the electron starts in the homo and in the homo-1 are comparable .",
    "third , the electron may also leave from one orbital and recombine with the other , and , quantum mechanically , the transition amplitude related to all physical processes involved will interfere .",
    "the influence of the homo-1 in the high - harmonic spectra of @xmath10 has been recently observed @xcite .",
    "one should note , however , that , for @xmath10 , the homo and the homo-1 exhibit very distinct shapes and symmetry .",
    "in fact , the former is a @xmath0 orbital and the latter a @xmath1 orbital .",
    "therefore , they are expected to behave differently as the alignment angle of the molecule with regard to the laser - field polarization is varied . apart from that ,",
    "the @xmath11 orbital is doubly degenerate .    in our investigations ,",
    "we employ the strong - field approximation @xcite , and saddle - point methods .",
    "the transition amplitudes obtained within this framework can be related to the classical orbits of an electron in a time - dependent field , and , yet , they retain information on the quantum interference between the possible physical processes @xcite . throughout",
    ", we employ the length gauge .",
    "even though there is considerable debate about which gauge to employ , and the length gauge sfa leads to potential - energy shifts whose meaning are not clear @xcite , it has been recently shown that the two - center interference patterns are absent in sfa computations of the high - harmonic spectra using the velocity - gauge @xcite .",

    "[ transampl ] , we provide the sfa transition amplitudes for the physical processes involved , for an exponential basis set involving slater - type orbitals , and for a split - valence , gaussian basis set . subsequently , in sec .",

    "such results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4].(b ) .",
    "qualitatively , the spectrum obtained in this way is in perfect agreement with those displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , which have been computed using @xmath184 only , or with that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3].(b ) , which incorporates the processes in which the electron recombines at @xmath184 in a two - dimensional scenario . in fact , all such spectra exhibit a minimum above @xmath263 for @xmath264 in the vicinity of zero , which moves towards the cutoff for @xmath265 .",
    "the harmonic yield in fig .",
    "[ fig4].(b ) , especially in the region of small alignment angles , is up to the three orders of magnitude weaker than the full spectrum .",
    "this huge discrepancy , however , would not cause any blurring in the full spectrum .",
    "potentially , the blurring may also be caused by the processes in which the electron is released from the @xmath12 orbital and recombines with _ any _ of the @xmath11 orbitals . in this latter case",
    ", a minimum near @xmath263 for @xmath165 in the vicinity of zero would also be present .",
    "therefore , such processes must be incorporated . in fig .",
    "[ fig4].(c ) , we consider the contributions from all possible processes finishing at the @xmath11 orbitals , regardless of where the electron left from . as expected , there is a substantial increase in the yield for small angles , in comparison to fig .",
    "[ fig4].(b )",
    ".    such increase is however not sufficient to match the contributions from the @xmath12 states to the full spectrum . in fig .",
    "[ fig4].(d ) , we show that , for small alignment angles , the processes for which the electron recombines with the @xmath12 state dominate .",
    "in fact , for @xmath266 the yield in fig .  [ fig4].(d )",
    "is roughly one order of magnitude larger than that displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4].(c ) .",
    "this is not obvious , as there are twice as many more processes contributing to the yield in this latter case , namely six against three . a direct comparison of figs .",
    "[ fig4].(a ) and  [ fig4].(d ) also shows the above - mentioned dominance for small angles . for larger angles ,",
    "the contributions from the @xmath254 orbitals start to play a more significant role and there is an increase in the blurring . in all cases for which the electron only starts from or recombines with the @xmath254 orbitals [ figs .",
    "[ fig4].(b ) and [ fig4].(c ) ] , there is a strong suppression of the yield for parallel alignment .",
    "this is due to the fact that the nodal plane along the molecular axis coincides with the laser - polarization axis in this case .",
    "we considered the influence of two closely lying molecular orbitals on the high - order harmonic spectrum from @xmath10 : the @xmath254 and @xmath12 orbitals .",
    "we employed a very simple model , in which the strong - field approximation has been modified in order to incorporate the situations in which an electron leaves from the @xmath12 orbital and recombines with @xmath254 and vice - versa .",
    "we have also included the degeneracy of the @xmath254 orbital .",
    "we made a detailed assessment of the contributions of all possible processes to the high - order harmonic spectra .",
    "the main conclusion to be drawn from this work is that the shape and the two - center interference patterns observed for the high - order harmonic spectra from @xmath10 are mainly determined by the @xmath12 orbital , even though the @xmath254 orbitals are energetically very close .",
    "the main effect of the latter orbitals is to introduce some blurring in the interference minimum determined by @xmath12 .",
    "physically , this is due to the particular geometry of the @xmath254 orbitals .",
    "indeed , for small alignment angles @xmath165 , these orbitals exhibit a nodal plane close to the polarization axis , so that tunneling and recombination are strongly suppressed .",
    "hence , in this region , the high - order harmonic spectra are mainly dominated by the @xmath12 orbital . we have verified that this dominance extends up to approximately @xmath267 . for the parameters considered in this paper ,",
    "the two - center minimum occurs within this region , so that it is mainly determined by the @xmath12 state .",
    "furthermore , due to their nontrivial dependence on the azimuthal angle , the @xmath254 orbitals carry less weight when this parameter is integrated over . interestingly , even if a three - dimensional computation is carried out and the degeneracy of the @xmath254 orbitals is considered , this angular dependence outweighs the fact that there are more processes in which the electron recombines with one of the @xmath254 orbitals .",
    "we have also shown that , due to the above - mentioned non - trivial angular dependence , the influence of such orbitals is over - estimated if the dynamics of the problem is reduced to the @xmath268 plane , i.e. , if the azimuthal angle @xmath269 is chosen to be vanishing .",
    "such an approximation has been extensively used in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite in with hhg from the @xmath270 orbital of the @xmath271 molecule has been computed ) .",
    "this is not an obvious result , as two - dimensional models do not consider the degeneracy of the @xmath254 orbital .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that the findings of this paper agree qualitatively with recent results obtained employing more sophisticated methods , such as dyson orbitals and many - body perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "therein , it has been shown that many - electron effects did not play a significant role in the bound - state reconstruction of @xmath10 , and that the information retrieved from the spectra was mostly related to the @xmath12 orbital .",
    "it may , however , be possible to identify the influence of the @xmath254 orbitals by looking at effects for perpendicular - aligned molecules , or relatively large alignment angles . in this case , the contributions from @xmath12 to the high - order harmonic spectrum are not expected to obfuscate those from @xmath254 .",
    "in fact , recently , the influence of the latter orbitals on the hhg spectrum of @xmath10 has been identified experimentally for perpendicular - aligned molecules , in form of a maximum at the rotational half - revival @xcite .",
