    "in the last twelve years , the field of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics has been given a boost by the discovery of a number of new , general results regarding the fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities such as heat , work and entropy .",
    "this paper is not intended as a survey article , rather , we will restrict ourselves to non - equilibrium stationary state fluctuation theorems ( fts ) .",
    "a stationary state ft was first discovered in @xcite .",
    "this ft is a quantitative relation between the probability to observe a positive entropy production @xmath0 versus a negative one @xmath1 over a time interval @xmath2 .",
    "given the probability distribution @xmath3 of a fluctuating quantity @xmath4 , scaled such that its average is equal to one , the conventional fluctuation theorem ( cft ) ( also called the gallavotti - cohen fluctuation theorem ) takes the form@xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the average ( dimensionless ) entropy production rate over positive times , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is an upper bound on the values of @xmath4 for which the cft holds .    whether the cft holds depends on the kind of system and on what the quantity @xmath4 represents .",
    "choices for @xmath4 that have been used in the literature include the phase space contraction rate @xcite , a `` dissipation function''@xcite , an `` action functional''@xcite , and , more concretely , work , heat and entropy production .",
    "the value of @xmath8 can also depend on the quantity under consideration .",
    "the stationary state fluctuation theorem holds quite generally ( i.e. for a large class of deterministic@xcite and stochastic systems@xcite ) , and has been verified in laboratory experiments@xcite .    the behavior for values @xmath9 has recently been elucidated for specific systems , and led to an extended fluctuation theorem ( eft ) for heat@xcite , which we will discuss in detail below .",
    "in this paper , we will give an overview of some interesting results of the stationary state fluctuation theorem for an exactly solvable model of a brownian particle in a harmonic potential which is dragged through a surrounding fluid . while this model is based on a langevin equation",
    ", the conclusions from this model also pertain to certain purely deterministic systems , as we will point out .",
    "we will first introduce the model in sec .",
    "[ nebp ] and discuss its exact solution in sec .",
    "[ solution ] .",
    "we will then turn our attention to thermodynamic quantities of the dissipated heat and the supplied work , and their fluctuations , both for finite and infinite time in sec .",
    "[ flucts ] . in sec .",
    "[ fts ] we will show that this results in two kinds of stationary state fluctuation relations : the conventional fluctuation theorem ( cft ) , for work fluctuations , and an extended fluctuation theorem ( eft ) , for heat fluctuations .",
    "the paper ends with a discussion in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] of the results and generalizations that have appeared in the literature .",
    "consider a spherical brownian particle of mass @xmath10 and diameter @xmath11 suspended in an equilibrium fluid with viscosity @xmath12 and temperature @xmath13 .",
    "the motion of this brownian particle can be described by the langevin equation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the position of the particle , @xmath16 its velocity and @xmath17 the stokes friction coefficient .",
    "furthermore , @xmath18 is a gaussian fluctuating force whose average ( over realizations ) @xmath19 and whose time correlations are delta - correlated , i.e. @xmath20 where @xmath21 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath22 is the identity matrix .",
    "consider now the situation in which an external force acts on the brownian particle ( but not on the fluid ) . under the assumption that the fluid is unperturbed such that @xmath23 and the properties of @xmath24 are not changed ,",
    "the langevin equation gets modified to @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the external force , which may depend on position and time .    of particular interest here",
    "is the case in which the force derives from a moving harmonic potential @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath28 where the potential @xmath29 and the center @xmath30 of the potential changes in time according to @xmath31 this corresponds to the particle being trapped in a harmonic well , the center @xmath32 of which moves with a constant velocity @xmath33 , to which we will restrict ourselves here .",
    "this closely resembles the experimental system of a brownian particle in a moving optical trap studied by wang _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "one also needs to specify the initial condition of the system . in time",
    ", the distribution of @xmath15 and @xmath34 approach a non - equilibrium stationary state distribution @xmath35 asymptotically .",
    "it is not hard to show that @xmath36 , \\label{fness}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 .",
    "note that if @xmath38 this reduces to the equilibrium distribution . to focus on the non - equilibrium stationary state fluctuations",
    ", one can take as an initial condition that the distribution at time @xmath39 , denoted by @xmath40 , is equal to @xmath35 .",
    "this system exhibits many features of general non - equilibrium systems , namely the presence of a current , energy dissipation , and entropy and heat production due to the continuous input of work from the outside .",
    "thus it can serve as a prototypical non - equilibrium system .",
    "the advantage of looking at this particular system is that it can be solved exactly ( as was first exploited for work fluctuations by mazonka and jarzynski@xcite ) .",
    "in fact , this system can also be solved exactly for a general the time dependence of the center @xmath30 of the harmonic potential , as was shown in @xcite .",
    "the exact solution of the brownian particle system introduced above proceeds through a time - dependent change of coordinates that brings the equations into a form in which the force does not depend on time , and whose solution is known .    as explained in @xcite , to eliminate the time dependence of the force , such a coordinate transformation should take the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is any solution of the equations of motion in the absence of the fluctuating force .",
    "one such solution is @xmath43 note that the new coordinate system corresponds to a frame that is co - moving with the fictitious noiseless trajectory @xmath44 , and that along this fictitious trajectory , the friction force @xmath45 is exactly balanced by the harmonic force @xmath46 .    in the co - moving frame ,",
    "the langevin equation becomes [ cf.eqs. ] @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "equation is of the same form as eq . but with @xmath38 , so it describes the system with a stationary harmonic potential .",
    "this system is well - studied and is an example of a so - called ornstein - uhlenbeck process@xcite . roughly speaking",
    ", an ornstein - uhlenbeck process is a stationary markov process that can be described by a langevin equation with linear forces and a gaussian random force term .",
    "equation is markovian because the time - derivatives of @xmath49 only depend on quantities at that same time . as a consequence of the markovian nature of the process",
    ", all its properties can be expressed in terms of the green s function @xmath50 which is the probability , in the co - moving frame , for the particle to be at position @xmath51 with velocity @xmath52 given that it was at position @xmath49 with velocity @xmath53 a time @xmath54 earlier . for ornstein - uhlenbeck processes ,",
    "the green s function can be solved exactly and is gaussian in both the initial coordinates ( @xmath49 , @xmath55 ) and the final coordinates ( @xmath51,@xmath52 ) .",
    "it is this gaussian property that enables one to obtain many explicit results , as we will see .",
    "although this system can be solved exactly , to avoid unnecessarily complicated expressions , we will consider here only the overdamped case , which means taking the limit @xmath56 . in eq .",
    ", this limit can be taken by setting @xmath10 equal to zero , so that it reduces to @xmath57 , or @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the ( average ) relaxation time of this langevin equation .",
    "like the general case , this equation also describes an ornstein - uhlenbeck process , whose green s function is given by@xcite @xmath60^{1/2 }      \\exp\\left [ -\\frac{\\beta\\kappa}{2 }                  \\frac{|\\bm x'-e^{-t/\\tau_r}\\bm x|^2 }                  { 1-e^{-2t/\\tau_r } }               \\right ] .",
    "\\label{greens}\\ ] ]    given a set of times @xmath61 , one can write for the joint probability of the particle to be at position @xmath62 at time @xmath63 ( with @xmath64 ) : @xmath65 because each green s function is gaussian in both the initial and final positions [ cf .",
    "eq . ] , and the initial distribution in eq .",
    "is also gaussian in the initial position @xmath66 , the distribution @xmath67 is also gaussian .",
    "while on a macroscopic level , thermodynamic properties such as work , heat and entropy are well - defined , this is not the case on a mesoscopic level . to understand that there is an ambiguity ,",
    "consider trying to determine the `` energy of the system '' for the brownian particle under consideration .",
    "should this include the potential energy of the external harmonic force , or should this only be the ( kinetic ) energy of the brownian particle itself ? or consider the `` work done on the system '' .",
    "should this be the work done by the harmonic force on the particle , or should this be the work needed to move the harmonic potential ?",
    "the first choice is closely related to the mechanical definition of work , but it leads to work being done even in equilibrium ( although its average would be zero ) , a problem that is avoided by using the second choice .",
    "there are even more ambiguities when studying dissipation in non - equilibrium systems . when should energy be regarded as dissipated ?",
    "it would be ambiguous to say that the dissipated energy is that part of the energy input that can not be used to perform work .",
    "for instance , the harmonic potential energy can be used to store energy by displacing the brownian particle from its origin .",
    "is this dissipated energy ?",
    "a clever experimentalist may be able to extract useful work from this energy , but should the definition of dissipated energy depend on the ability of an experimentalist ?",
    "the ambiguity is thus due to what to call the system , and what forms of energy to consider as inaccessible or dissipated . to avoid this ambiguity",
    ", we will now define what we will mean by `` work '' and `` heat '' in the rest of the paper .",
    "the work will be defined as the work that is required to keep the harmonic potential moving .",
    "because at time @xmath54 the harmonic potential exerts a force @xmath68 on the particle , the particle will exert a reaction force @xmath69 on the harmonic potential ( or on whatever device generated it ) . to keep the potential moving",
    "therefore requires ( at least ) a compensating force @xmath70 to be applied to the potential . since the velocity of the potential is @xmath71 ( cf .",
    "eq  ) , the mechanical work done by this compensating force during a time interval @xmath2 is @xmath72 .",
    "\\label{wdef}\\ ] ] note that this definition of `` work on the system '' uses the particle plus the harmonic potential as the system .",
    "on the other hand , we will define the heat as the energy which is given off to the fluid , taking the point of view that since the energy of the fluid is not explicitly present in the langevin description , we can suppose it to be unaccessible or dissipated energy .",
    "this leads to the following expression for the heat : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the change in harmonic potential from time @xmath75 to time @xmath2 . in words , this states that work can be converted both into potential energy of the brownian particle , or into heat dissipated into the fluid .",
    "note that in the general ( non - overdamped ) case , the change in kinetic energy of the particle should also be subtracted from @xmath76 to obtain the heat .",
    "given the definitions of the work and the heat and the green s function of the process , we can study the probability distributions of their fluctuations .",
    "once the probability distributions are obtained , it can be checked whether they obey a stationary state fluctuation theorem .",
    "in addition ( and in contrast to the majority of theoretical works on the subject ) , _ the explicit solution available for this system allows us to consider finite time corrections to these theorems as well .",
    "these corrections give information about the time scales on which these stationary state fluctuation theorems can be observed .",
    "_    an essential ingredient in the calculation will be that any linear function of a gaussian distributed quantity is again a gaussian distributed quantity , so that the distribution of such a quantity is fully determined by its mean and its variance .",
    "while the work @xmath76 in eq . is a linear function of @xmath77 , making it gaussian distributed , the heat @xmath78 in eq . is not a linear function of @xmath77 , but is in fact a quadratic function of @xmath77 and consequently not gaussian distributed .",
    "this quadratic nature prevents a straightforward calculation of the heat probability distribution function , but still allows the computation of its fourier transform , using the following trick .",
    "consider first the joint probability @xmath79 which gives the probability that the particle moves from position @xmath80 to position @xmath81 and an amount @xmath76 of work is done in the process .",
    "since these three quantities are all linear functions of @xmath77 , their joint distribution is gaussian , i.e. of the form @xmath82 where for brevity we denoted @xmath83 , @xmath84 as the mean of @xmath85 and @xmath86 as the variance matrix of @xmath85 .",
    "using @xmath87 , the distributions of @xmath76 and @xmath78 can be expressed as @xmath88 where @xmath89 as given by eq .  .",
    "taking the fourier transform of these equations yields @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the fourier variable .",
    "the integrals on the right hand sides are all just gaussian integrals , which can be performed explicitly once @xmath84 and @xmath86 are determined .",

    "a complicating factor is that @xmath112 is complex valued .",
    "if one takes @xmath110 to be the point on the real line where @xmath112 has a maximum real part , then the integrand can be highly oscillatory there , causing the contribution of this otherwise dominant point to be washed out .",
    "a maximum that does not suffer from this oscillatory behavior can be found , but usually not on the real axis ; indeed the solution of @xmath113 lies here in the complex plane .",
    "an interesting property of complex functions is that they have no true maximum .",
    "according to the cauchy - riemann identities for complex functions , the point @xmath110 defined by has the property that there is a path through it called the path of steepest descent , on which @xmath112 has a constant imaginary part and its real part has a maximum , while along another ( orthogonal ) path the function has a minimum ( also with constant imaginary part ) ; thus @xmath110 is a saddle point of @xmath112 .",
    "the saddle point character of @xmath110 does not interfere with it being the dominant contribution to the integral , as long as we can deform the original line of integration ( the real axis ) into a contour which overlaps with the path of steepest descent through @xmath114 .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown that along this line the function does not oscillate , so that the point @xmath110 truly gives the dominant contribution .",
    "note that during the deformation of the integration contour , the endpoints ( @xmath115 on the real axis ) must be fixed and no singularities of the function must be crossed .",
    "the value of integral along this deformed contour is then exactly equal to that of the original integral . to get the saddle point approximation ,",

    "@xmath126 note that for real @xmath127 , this expression is real ( i.e. , non - oscillatory ) and has a maximum at @xmath128 : the path of steepest descent therefore crosses @xmath110 parallel to the real axis .",
    "thus we can indeed deform the original line of integration ( the real axis ) by shifting the integration contour up or down ( depending on @xmath4 ) until it crosses @xmath110 ; this changes the end points @xmath115 , but the integrand vanishes there , so that the integral over the shifted line is still the same as for the original integration line . this",
    "is sketched in left panel of figure  1 .",

    "this derivative is rather complicated , in contrast to the simple linear function that it was for the work functions . to make the expressions in the following a bit more manageable ,",

    "such an equation has four solutions ; hence there are four saddle points , in contrast to the fourier transform of the work distribution , which had only one . which saddle point(s ) to use depends on how we can deform the real axis integration contour to include saddle points without crossing any singularities . as eq .",

    "the limit is in all these cases also due to singularities in the complex plane of the fourier transform of the distribution , which correspond to exponential tails of the distribution itself .",
    "\\5 . turning to deterministic systems",
    ", evans@xcite argued that there should be a relation between the ft in such systems and the eft .",
    "indeed , gilbert has shown numerically that the eft holds in a nose - hoover thermostated lorentz gas@xcite and @xcite explains in a general way why the eft should hold using a large deviation formalism , but still assuming that there are exponential tails and that the work fluctuations have faster than exponential tails .",
    "they also provide a strategy on how to apply the chaotic hypothesis to singular systems such as lennard - jones systems , by using a poincar section that circumvents the singularities in the potential .",
    "a derivation of a general form of the eft has been given for stochastic systems by baiesi _",
    "_ @xcite and for deterministic systems by bonetto _",
    "@xcite , both based ( among others ) on the presence of exponential tails .",
    "they found that universal features in the eft of the @xmath180 are the slope one for @xmath166 and the presence of a plateau for large @xmath4 . on the other hand ,",
    "the shape and extent of the intermediate-@xmath4 region is not universal , nor is the height of the plateau , unless the work distribution is symmetric around its average , in which case the plateau value is always 2 .",
    "evidence for the eft has been seen in experiments as well , notably by garnier and ciliberto in an electric circuit@xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the gallavotti - cohen fluctuation theorem ( eq .  ( 1 ) ) , meaning the stationary state fluctuation theorem for entropy production , or heat , would not hold near equilibrium , but the ft for the `` dissipation function '' of evans and searles ( which often coincides with work ) would@xcite .",
    "however , it seems that in the appropriate limit @xmath135 , with a restriction @xmath179 , the gallavotti - cohen fluctuation theorem does hold .",
    "nonetheless , there is a problem in observing the eft for heat near equilibrium that the cft for work does not have .",
    "as we can see in the exactly solved model of the brownian particle , the ft for work decays to the correct ft form on a time scale of @xmath181 [ cf .",
    "one the other hand , the heat ft for @xmath166 decays to the correct ft on a time scale of @xmath182 [ cf .",
    "the latter time scale diverges as @xmath6 gets smaller , i.e. , as one gets closer to equilibrium , whereas the time scale for the work ft ( i.e. , @xmath160 ) does not .",
    "this explains why it is very hard to see the ft for heat in simulations@xcite .",
