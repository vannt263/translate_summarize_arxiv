    "two lines of thought exist as to the nature of soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) . on the one hand ,",
    "thompson and duncan ( 1995 ) propose neutron stars with super - critical ( @xmath0 gauss ) magnetic fields , which spindown the stars and power the gamma - ray bursts . on the other hand , several authors ( van paradijs et al . 1995 ; alpar , 2000 ; chatterjee , hernquist & narayan , 2000 ; marsden et al .",
    "2001 [ mlrh ] ) propose neutron stars with typical pulsar magnetic fields ( @xmath1 gauss ) , which are spundown by magnetospheric  propeller \" torques from fallback or fossil disks .",
    "the association with visible supernova remnants has long been recognized ( e.g. cline et al .",
    "1982 ) , and recently reaffirmed ( mlrh ; figure 1 and table i ) , as the primary evidence for the sgr / axp s relatively young ages , which together with their unusually long periods , distinguished them as a unique class of pulsars .",
    "mlrh have now shown from an analysis of the snrs associated with sgr / axps , that essentially all ( @xmath2 80% ) of them occur in the warm phase of the ism .",
    "this is very unexpected , since observations of extragalactic type ii / ibc sn ( van dyk , hamuy & filippenko 1996 ) , galactic snrs ( higdon & lingenfelter 1980 ) and young pulsars ( mlrh ) , all show ( table i ) that only a small fraction ( @xmath3 20% ) of all the neutron star producing type ii / ibc sn actually occur in the warm phase of the ism , whereas the bulk ( @xmath4 80% ) of them occur instead in the more tenuous ( @xmath5 0.001 @xmath6 ) hot phase . consequently , something about the dense ism environment shapes the character of the sgr / axps and makes them different from the more common neutron star population of radio pulsars .",
    "although the propeller disk model is quite successful in explaining the properties of sgrs and axps , there are two important issues that need to be addressed .",
    "the first issue concerns the multiwavelength emission from pushback disks , which should manifest itself primarily at infrared wavelengths as result of the high fraction of refractory dust grains from the heavy supernova ejecta . because of the high grain content , standard gas disk spectra ( e.g. perna , hernquist , & narayan 2000 ) are not applicable in this case , since the bulk of the disk energy will be radiated at wavelengths longer than the optical , where restrictive upper limits have been obtained for some of these objects ( hulleman et al .",
    "2000b ; kaplan et al .",
    "sensitive ir observations of the nearby sgrs and axps are needed before serious constraints can be placed on the propeller disk model .",
    "secondly , the recently noted correlation between the spectra and spindown torques of sgrs and axps ( marsden & white 20001 ) needs to be explained in terms of the two theoretical models for sgrs and axps . models of accreting neutron star spectra can produce spectra with the blackbody plus soft power law shape characteristic of sgrs and axps , but it is unclear if the spectral hardness increases with spindown torque as indicated by the observations .",
    "similarly , detailed calculations of the quiescent spectra of magnetars have yet to be done .",
    "this work was performed while one of the authors ( dm ) held a national research council - gsfc research associateship .",
