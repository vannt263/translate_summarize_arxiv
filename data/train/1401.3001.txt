    "galaxy clusters are important probes of cosmology and galaxy evolution because they are the largest virialized structures in the universe , they occupy very massive dark matter halos , and they provide a unique physical environment for the transformation of galaxies . because their abundance is extremely sensitive to several cosmological parameters @xcite they can serve as effective cosmological probes .",
    "while many works have provided cosmological constraints with massive - low redshift samples @xcite , present and future surveys are obtaining samples spanning a wide range of redshift and mass ( e.g. @xcite ) in order to capture evolution and provide constraints on dark energy evolution and mass - richness relation .",
    "galaxy clusters , being the densest environments , also act as laboratories for a number of studies related to galaxy evolution . for instance , many studies have found an evolution of the blue fraction with redshift albeit with a wide dispersion @xcite , measured and fit the luminosity function down to the faint end for different surveys @xcite , characterized the slope of the color - magnitude relation to at least up to redshift 1.6 @xcite , or measured the dependence of the star formation rate with the environment and redshift @xcite .",
    "large - area surveys have been able to detect very rare and massive clusters ( m@xmath5 ) with a variety of different methods ( e.g. , sdss @xcite , macs , @xcite ; planck , @xcite ) .",
    "in general , the most massive clusters are easy to identify up to moderate redshift ( z@xmath6 0.5 ) since they contain large numbers of tightly clustered galaxies @xcite , strong x - ray emission signatures @xcite , relatively strong features in the gravitational lensing shear field @xcite and potential sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) signatures @xcite .",
    "moreover , many high redshift clusters have also been detected in different surveys with a number of different techniques ( e.g. , optical - infrared : rcs2319530038.0 at z=0.9 , @xcite ; rzcs052 at z=1.016 , @xcite ; iscs j143809 + 341419 at z=1.41 , @xcite ; a structure at z@xmath7 1.6 , @xcite ; jkcs 041 at z=1.803 , @xcite ; x - rays : clj1226.9 + 3332 at z=0.89 .",

    "all these techniques depend strongly on the depth of the observations and the characterization of their selection functions for each particular dataset is crucial to compare and avoid systematic errors .    in recent years , the low redshift regime of optical clusters has been widely sampled in the literature .",
    "very wide surveys with spectroscopy such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss,@xcite ) have been explored resulting in several cluster catalogs @xcite .",
    "these surveys probe up to z@xmath7 0.45 ( see figure 3 in @xcite ) and down to masses of a few @xmath9 .",
    "as for high redshift cluster samples , two main surveys with deep infrared data have been widely explored with a systematic search of galaxy clusters : the spitzer infrared array camera shallow survey @xcite and the spitzer adaptation of the red - sequence cluster survey ( sparcs ; @xcite ) .",
    "these surveys have discovered several clusters at z@xmath101 , some of them confirmed spectroscopically .    regarding optical cluster catalogs within the intermediate redshift range , @xmath11 , a number of surveys",
    "have been released during the last years .",
    "their width , depth and photometric redshift accuracy play an important role in the resulting number of clusters and the limits in mass and redshift .",
    "extremely deep surveys such as goods @xcite or cosmos @xcite also have small sampling areas , achieving a similar cosmic volume to shallower and wider surveys such as the canada - france - hawaii - telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) . in a previous paper , ( @xcite , a12 hereafter )",
    ", we detected galaxy clusters in the cfhtls - archive - research survey ( cars , @xcite ) , finding agreement with other works previously made in the cfhtls - wide and deep .",
    "the resulting sample extended up to z@xmath121.2 and masses down to @xmath13 .",
    "very few surveys at this range of redshift are both deep and wide , which makes difficult the identification of large samples of clusters down to small masses at moderate redshifts .    the deep lens survey ( dls ; @xcite ) , a very deep four optical band survey of 20 square degrees , is both wide and deep enough to obtain a substantial number of clusters down to @xmath14 in this redshift range . in a12",
    "we introduced a new method to detect galaxy clusters , the bayesian cluster finder ( bcf ) , based on a bayesian approach of the matched filter technique .",
    "we tested the algorithm extensively on simulations , finding higher rates of both completeness and purity than other methods .    in this paper",
    ", we apply the bcf to the dls and release the first optical galaxy cluster catalog in the survey including positions , redshift , richnesses , masses and radii .",
    "the number of clusters per volume unit considered here is significantly higher than sdss , especially at z@xmath100.2 .",
    "furthermore , we are obtaining a similar density of clusters as similar - depth surveys ( cfthls - deep , for instance ) but with a considerable increase ( five times ) in area .",
    "sample variance is nevertheless substantial in a 20 @xmath15 survey , so we do not attempt to constrain cosmology here .",
    "our primary goal is to select a cluster sample to enable a series of studies of the galactic population in such clusters . in this first work",
    ", we investigate the relation between the bcg properties of the sample with the properties of the host clusters within a redshift range of 0.25@xmath00.8 and masses m@xmath16 .",
    "this analysis is the first one carried out with such a broad sample and will extend the previous results for the relationships between bcg and host cluster @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the dls data we are using in this paper .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the dls optical cluster detections and the comparison with other detections in the same survey . in section 4 ,",
    "we analyze the mass and redshift properties of the detections and in section 5 , we study the relationship between the bcgs and the host cluster properties . finally , section 6 includes the summary with the final conclusions of the paper .",
    "where appropriate , we use @xmath17=71 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 , @xmath19 = 0.27 , @xmath20=0.73 throughout this paper .",
    "the deep lens survey ( dls , @xcite ) is a very deep _ bvrz _ imaging survey of five @xmath21 degree fields imaged with the mosaic prime - focus imager at kitt peak mayall 4 m telescope ( f1 and f2 ) and at cerro tololo blanco 4 m telescope ( f3 , f4 and f5 ) .",
    "each dls field is divided into a @xmath22 grid of @xmath23 subfields .",
    "the observing strategy was to observe in @xmath24 band when the seeing fwhm was @xmath12 0.9@xmath25 and in @xmath26 otherwise .",
    "thus , the r - band imaging has fairly uniform good resolution , which is particularly convenient for weak lensing ( wl ) purposes .",
    "the final exposure time was 18 kiloseconds for the r band and 12 kiloseconds for the @xmath27,@xmath28 and @xmath29 band .",
    "this survey has proved to be one of the deepest surveys with wide area ( @xmath30 deg@xmath31 ) in the literature .",
    "it achieves 50% completeness at @xmath32 ( vega ) for a typical field .",
    "the photometric redshifts have been calculated using bpz @xcite with tweaked templates and priors ( see @xcite for full details ) .",
    "bpz provides a bayesian photometric redshift , @xmath33 , and a spectral type associated with this photometric redshift , @xmath34 .",
    "we use the @xmath33 point estimator obtaining a photometric redshift dispersion of @xmath35 as judged by comparison with the overlapping primus @xcite r@xmath1223 spectroscopic sample @xcite .",
    "the photometric redshift distribution of the sample peaks at @xmath7 0.6 .",
    "more details on the dls survey can be found in wittman et al .",
    "2013 , in preparation .    for this work",
    ", we selected all the objects that are outside of the regions masked due to bright star effects and are classified as galaxies according to the @xmath36 statistic .",
    "this statistic is the @xmath37 for a point - spread function ( psf ) model fitting the second central moments of the object ( wittman et al 2013 in preparation ) , and we required @xmath38 for three degrees of freedom .",
    "several previous papers have examined the dark matter distribution in the dls .",
    "@xcite presented a wl reconstruction for one of the fields ( f2 ) in the dls .",
    "additionally , @xcite studied eight shear - selected galaxy clusters in the dls and @xcite obtained mass measurements for them . in a complementary study , @xcite performed a comparison between the x - ray and weak lensing masses for the four top - ranked shear - selected clumps of abell 781 , one of the clusters in the dls . in this paper , we will use these directly measured wl masses to compare to masses inferred from optical richness using the optical richness - mass relation of @xcite .",
    "calibrating the richness - mass relation from the dls data itself is beyond the scope of this paper and will be the subject of a future paper .",
    "we detected galaxy clusters in the dls by using an improved version of the bcf introduced in a12 .",
    "we give a brief summary here and refer the reader to a12 for more details .",
    "the bcf calculates the probability at a given redshift that there is a cluster with a determined density and luminosity profile centered on each galaxy , including different priors related to the color - magnitude relation of the cluster or the bcg magnitude - redshift relation .",
    "we performed a search in twelve fixed redshift slices , @xmath39 , from 0.1 to 1.2 with a bin width of 0.1 .",
    "we set the core radius to 1.5 mpc and the luminosity function parameters to @xmath40=-21.44 and @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "we corrected the probability assigned to those galaxies lying close to the masked stars or borders of the image by a factor proportional to the missed area .",
    "the clusters are selected as the peaks of these probability maps .",
    "the bcf algorithm was originally validated on the cars ( a12 ) dataset , and the different nature of the dls data required one substantial adjustment to the algorithm .",
    "low - redshift galaxies can be saturated in the long exposures of the dls , which leads to poor photometric redshift quality and confusion with stars @xcite .",
    "therefore , we identified the cluster center as the location of the probability peak , rather than setting the cluster location to that of the most likely bcg as in a12 .",
    "we also made one minor adjustment in the process of merging propinquitous detections into single cluster candidates .",
    "as in a12 , we merge detections with a redshift difference of less than two bins , but we now consider detections separated by 1.0 mpc or more ( vs. 1.5 mpc in a12 ) to be separate clusters . since clusters are spatially correlated and this correlation increases with cosmic time , this prevents overmerging of candidates at low redshift .",
    "note that the merging procedure has a nontrivial effect on the cluster counts and on the comparison of catalogues by different authors , as discussed in a12 .",
    "in a12 we extracted an optical cluster catalog from the cars data using the bcf , and we performed simulations based on the cars data to test the completeness and purity of the results . here",
    "we perform 20 realizations of similar simulations tuned to the dls . in these simulations",
    ", we created nine clusters with different richnesses from @xmath42=10 to @xmath42=200 for each redshift slice .",
    "the parameter , @xmath42 , is a measurement of the richness of the cluster .",
    "it is equivalent to the luminosity of the cluster in units of @xmath43 .",
    "we mimicked the expected photometric redshift errors for the dls by using a gaussian with @xmath44 .",
    "we also fixed the slope and characteristic magnitude of the luminosity function and the core radius of the density profile as in a12 .",
    "we assigned colors to mock cluster members using the prescription given by @xcite , and then added photometric measurement errors appropriate for those magnitudes in the dls .",
    "in addition , we embedded these clusters in a background distribution created separately .",
    "this distribution is drawn from the redshift , magnitude and color distribution of the dls after subtracting a first iteration of cluster detections from the survey , with positions drawn by following the rayleigh - levy galaxy pair separation as in a12 .",
    "we used different simulated backgrounds for each realization so that artificial background detections can not repeat in all realizations .",
    "we then simulated the effects of area lost to bright stars by applying the actual dls masks on the simulations . for a more complete explanation ,",
    "we refer readers to a12 .",
    "these simulations include the most important sources of noise , but do not include some secondary sources such as cluster ellipticity and non - gaussian photometric redshift errors . because no simulation includes all the sources of error present in real data , the simulation results should be interpreted as providing an upper limit on the purity and completeness .",
    "however , we show below ( section $ 3.1 ) that the completeness in real data is @xmath790% , at least in the redshift ( @xmath45 ) and richness range ( @xmath46 ) in which we can directly test our sample against other samples .    in figure",
    "[ fig : completpurity ] , we show these rates as a function of simulated redshift and richness .",
    "we see that the completeness and purity are above @xmath7 70% throughout the redshift range @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "we also find a strong decrease of both the purity and completeness for clusters with @xmath49 20 .    , based on detections in mock data .",
    "completeness and purity are @xmath5070% at all redshifts for @xmath51 . because the mock data include the most important sources of noise , performance on real data should approach these levels . ]",
    "we find 43.5 , 53.25 , 42.75 , 42 and 39 clusters per square degree in fields 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 respectively with 0.1@xmath0 1.2 , detecting a total of 882 clusters down to @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "we provide the complete optical cluster catalog for the dls in table [ tab : tabdls ] .",
    "the first two columns are the cluster center coordinates , the third column is the galaxy cluster redshift estimated from the redshift slice that maximizes the probability , and the fourth column is the galaxy cluster redshift estimated from the peak of the gaussian fit to the galaxy population of the cluster .",
    "the fifth column refers to the @xmath42 richness parameter obtained from the algorithm .",
    "the sixth column is @xmath54 , the cluster richness considered as the number of red galaxies within @xmath55 .",
    "the seventh column is the cluster radius , @xmath55 , which we estimate from an empirical relation by @xcite . finally , we estimate the mass of the cluster , @xmath56 , from the empirical relation between @xmath42 measured from optical detections and @xmath56 from wl measurements by @xcite ; the eighth column lists this mass estimate .",
    "the uncertainties have been estimated by propagating the errors in the @xmath42 measurement ( estimated from the simulations ) into the empirical formula by @xcite .",

    "[ tab : tabdls ]      we performed a systematic search of optical cluster catalogs detected in surveys that overlap with any of the dls fields in order to compare with the optical detections found in this work .",

    "the first survey is the northern sky optical cluster survey ( nosocs , @xcite ) .",
    "this survey overlaps with dls f2 , and it probes up to z @xmath7 0.26 for the overlapping area with f2 . in table [ tab : knownclustersnososc ] , we show each cluster detected in the nosocs survey and its dls counterpart , if any .",
    "the first column refers to the name of the nosocs cluster , the second and third column are the cluster center coordinates and fourth column is the estimated redshift .",
    "the fifth and sixth column are the coordinates of the dls counterpart , the seventh refers to the estimated photometric redshift , the eighth and ninth represent the angular and spatial offset between the nosocs and its counterpart , respectively .",
    "the physical offset , expressed in mpc is defined here and throughout the paper as the minimum of the two physical offsets obtained for the two different redshift estimates .",
    "finally , the tenth column represents the estimated redshift difference between both detections .",
    "we see that all the eleven clusters detected in nosocs are recovered by the dls with a redshift difference of less than @xmath58 .",

    "note that nosocs provides redshift estimates based on photometric redshifts with similar uncertainties as the dls .",
    "@xmath61    @xmath62 : these clusters correspond to different clumps of abell 781 .    [",
    "tab : knownclustersnososc ]    there are five abell @xcite clusters in the dls , listed in table [ tab : knownclustersabell ] .",
    "the bcf algorithm was successful in identifying abell 781 and abell 3338 and placing them at the correct redshift .",
    "however , the three abell clusters at @xmath63 were placed at somewhat higher redshift ( eg , abell 1836 at @xmath64 was placed at @xmath65 ) .",
    "this is due to a limitation of the data rather than the algorithm ; as explained above , some low - redshift galaxies are saturated due to the long exposures of the dls .",
    "these galaxies are thus eliminated from the catalog by cuts designed to eliminate stars , or have poor photometric redshift estimates .",
    "the nosocs clusters at @xmath66 also appear at higher redshift in our catalog for the same reason .",
    "therefore , users of our cluster catalog should exercise caution when interpreting the results for clusters with true redshifts @xmath67 or with redshifts listed in our catalog as @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath69    [ tab : knownclustersabell ]    the second optical survey we compared our detections with is the sdss , which has many catalogs of clusters already available .",

    "this redshift upper limit corresponds to the redshift at which the completeness of the sdss cluster sample is @xmath1095% .",
    "the mean and @xmath71 redshift differences are -0.03 and 0.009 , respectively .",
    "note that the dls is deeper and therefore complete to a lower limit than the sdss so we do expect some real clusters not to be found in the sdss .",

    "there are two competing effects .",
    "the photometry goes much deeper and contains many more galaxies than the spectroscopy ( @xmath71 million vs. @xmath710,000 in this field ) , but the limited redshift resolution provided by photometric redshifts allows clusters to be smeared out in redshift space , and this may allow poorer clusters to escape our detection threshold .",

    "the lines and colors are the same as in figure [ fig : histosigma ] . ]",
    "finally , figure [ fig : massg ] compares the mass estimates that we obtain in this work with the mass estimates obtained from the velocity dispersion @xmath83 given by @xcite by applying the virial theorem assuming that these clusters are spherical @xcite .",
    "the sample agrees well within the errors when they are matched to the shels sample or when we match the shels sample to the dls , obtaining a dispersion of 0.24 dex for both samples .",
    "other works @xcite , found a similar dispersion when comparing optical richness to @xmath56 estimated from x - ray or weak - lensing .",
    "@xmath85    @xmath62 : the velocity dispersion of these two clusters are estimated from table 2 in @xcite    [ tab : knownclustersshels ]          for each field we created matched pairs of optical detection and weak lensing maps .",
    "for the weak lensing maps we attempted to replicate the sliced redshift search of the bcf as follows . for a series of putative lens redshifts ( 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , 0.5 , 0.6 and 0.7 ) , we made convergence maps which were optimized for each lens redshift by weighting the sources according to their distance ratio assuming a lens at that redshift .",
    "however , unlike the optical search , each lens will appear in each convergence map because the distance - ratio weights change quite slowly with lens redshift .",
    "we attempt to remove this effect by converting the convergence maps into signal - to - noise maps and , at each location in sky coordinates , taking the maximum along the redshift axis .",
    "the result is not a standard lensing map , but it does replicate the basic features of the bcf . each cluster should appear on this map at its sky location and with pixel values proportional to its mass and to the effective distance ratio of dls source galaxies optimized for that lens redshift @xcite .",
    "we create a representation of what the optical cluster detections should look like on this map as follows .",
    "we represent each cluster by a two - dimensional gaussian centered at the cluster s sky coordinates and with a 1@xmath86 width of 1.5 mpc at the redshift of the cluster .",

    "we quantified the level of correlation , finding that the correlation coefficient of the optical and weak lensing maps ranges from 0.04 to 0.12 , depending on the field , with a median of 0.09 .",
    "in other words , about 10% of the variance in the weak lensing maps is explained by variance in the optical map , consistent with the statement that the weak lensing maps are dominated by noise .",
    "the observed correlation coefficients , although low , are real .",
    "we confirmed this by correlating the optical map in each field with a control sample of unrelated weak lensing maps  rotations and transpositions of the weak lensing maps , including those from other fields .",
    "the distributions of these correlation coefficients clearly exclude the true correlation coefficients , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : correlationprob ] .",
    "therefore , we have high confidence that a fraction of the variance in the weak lensing maps is explained by the optical detections , even though that fraction is small due to noise in the weak lensing maps .",
    "many works in the literature have been devoted to constraining cosmological parameters with cluster counts @xcite using large cluster samples . in this work ,",
    "we have detected clusters in a 20 @xmath15 sampling a wide range in mass and redshift . while we do not attempt to set cosmological constraints due to the sample variance , as a further check on the integrity of our sample we compare the recovered mass function with that predicted by lcdm .    in figure",
    "[ fig : histoz ] , we show the differential redshift distribution of the clusters detected in each dls field . across the entire survey , this distribution peaks at @xmath88 , but there is substantial variation from field to field due to sample variance .",
    "for example , f2 appears to be quite rich even in a simple visual inspection of its images , and this is reflected in the different vertical scale in the f2 panel .",
    "moreover , @xcite found multiple clusters in their spectroscopic survey in each of the richest f2 bins and @xcite also confirmed the richness of f2 with cosmic shear statistics .        to examine the mass function and its redshift evolution , we first correct for the different volume probed at different redshifts .",
    "figure [ fig : histomassz ] shows the differential number of clusters per cubic mpc as a function of mass in two redshift bins : 0 - 0.5 and 0.5 - 1.0 .",
    "the evolution with redshift is very striking , as many more high - mass clusters are detected ( per unit volume probed ) at low redshifts .",
    "this can not be a selection effect , because selection effects would have the opposite sign , favoring massive clusters over low - mass clusters at high redshift .",
    "we compared the mass function with numerical predictions .",
    "the solid color lines are the @xcite model whereas the dashed color lines refer to the @xcite predictions for @xmath89 = 200 .",
    "the results agree with both models between @xmath90 and @xmath91 while they seem to overestimate the number of clusters with respect to the models for masses lower than this limit .",
    "hence , we define the completeness limit as the mass down to which the measurements are consistent with the theoretical models ( vertical line ) , this limit being 2.4@xmath92 m@xmath93 .    ,",
    "solid line and @xmath94 , dotted line ) .",
    "the shaded areas show the uncertainties in converting richness to mass according to dong et al .",
    "2008 and the sample variance . for comparison ,",
    "cdm predictions from simulations by jenkins et al .",
    "2001 ( solid color lines ) and tinker et al . 2008",
    "( dashed color lines ) are overplotted with solid lines for the same redshift bins as the data . ]",
    "the observed differential distribution of mass in clusters is consistent with theoretical predictions , which supports our claim that the sample is highly complete in this mass and redshift range .",
    "in the last few years , extensive studies on the evolution of the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) have appeared in the literature .",
    "these objects are the largest and brightest galaxies in the universe and their formation is expected to be directly related to the formation of the cluster",
    ". more massive , larger , and more dominant bcgs tend to live in the most massive and luminous clusters .",
    "indeed , recent work @xcite reveals significant dependence on the cluster environment .",
    "however , the role that the cluster environment is playing in such galaxies is still a matter of debate .",
    "we selected the bcg of each cluster by considering all the galaxies enclosed within 1.0 mpc and within a photometric redshift range of @xmath95 and photometric redshift odds @xmath10 0.8 .",
    "then , we fit the red sequence ( @xmath96 and @xmath97 color versus @xmath24 magnitude ) to early type galaxies , which we defined as having a best - fit bpz type @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "we applied a 3@xmath86-clipping algorithm to the red sequence fit and finally , we selected the brightest of the galaxies within 3@xmath86 of the cluster red sequence .",
    "two effects might make bcgs confused with field or saturated galaxies .",
    "first , catastrophic photometric redshift errors occasionally include obvious foreground galaxies in the selection of the cluster population .",
    "second , the saturation of bright galaxies in the dls invites confusion with bright stars , which morphologically differ from the psf and may therefore contaminate the catalog . for these reasons ,",
    "we perform a visual classification of our selection sample .",
    "we define class a bcg candidates as those which clearly have bcg morphology ( i.e. early - type galaxies , large halos ) , or which are clearly the best bcg candidate in the region ; class b candidates as those which are plausible but which are not the only plausible candidate in the cluster ; and class c candidates are clearly spurious ( stars or foreground galaxies ) .",
    "we also included a saturation flag indicating whether the bcg was saturated due to long exposures .",
    "furthermore , another source of uncertainty needs to be taken into account .",
    "some bcgs have been reported to have bluer colors than the main red sequence @xcite .",
    "to take this fact into account , we set a color flag indicating the existence of bluer and brighter galaxies than the bcg candidate for a particular cluster .",
    "we found 27.3% of the whole sample have a bluer and brighter candidate . we also visually examined these blue candidates and classified them into one of the previous categories .",
    "blue candidates classified as a were considered as the cluster bcg .",
    "the final classification for the whole sample was 48.53% , 41.50% and 9.98% as a , b and c respectively .    in the following analysis",
    ", we impose several cuts to reduce the possibility of bias . at the high - redshift end",
    ", properties of clusters at @xmath99 become much more uncertain because most galaxies fainter galaxies than l * are not detectable .",
    "at the low - redshift end , saturation affects many bcg candidates at z@xmath1000.25 , so we limit the following analysis to @xmath101 . within these limits ,",
    "a few bcgs are still saturated , so we performed two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) tests on each of the seven cluster properties examined below to determine if excluding the saturated bcgs resulted in any significant differences .",
    "we found no significant differences , so we impose only the @xmath101 and not an additional saturation cut .",
    "in addition , we used only clusters with @xmath102 in order to select a complete sample in mass and avoid biases ( see figure [ fig : histomassz ] ) .",
    "this yielded a subsample of 285 bcgs and their host clusters of which 258 bcgs are classified as a+b ( of these , 159 are not saturated ) .",
    "we further determined that there are no significant differences between the a+b and the a sample using the same suite of ks tests .",
    "therefore , the following analysis uses the 258 systems which are classified as a or b , which have @xmath103 , and which lie in the redshift range @xmath101 .",
    "we now examine the correlation of bcg properties with cluster properties .",
    "we chose the size of the bcg , estimated from the isophotal area , the absolute magnitude ( k de - corrected and corrected for passive luminosity evolution , @xcite ) and redshift of the bcg .",
    "as for the cluster , we selected the redshift , @xmath56 , @xmath55 and the total luminosity , @xmath104 . in figure",
    "[ fig : bcghost ] , we show the relation between bcg properties and host cluster properties .",
    "we performed a spearman test to investigate if cluster and bcgs parameters deviates from the null hypothesis of no correlation . in table",
    "[ tab : corr ] , we list the number of standard deviations by which the sum - squared difference of rank deviates from the null hypothesis expected value . for clarity , we have not included the error bars in the plot but they are included in table [ tab : corr ] .",
    "@xmath105 [ tab : corr ]    we consider a correlation to be significant if the absolute value of the significance of the spearman test is larger than 3 .",
    "table [ tab : corr ] shows that , according to this criterion , the bcg @xmath106 is positively correlated with cluster redshift and @xmath55 and the bcg size is negatively correlated with cluster redshift in agreement with other works up to redshift @xmath8 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "while it is well known that the most massive clusters host the brightest bcgs ( see similar results for more massive clusters in a12 ( up to z@xmath7 0.6 ) and @xcite ( up to z@xmath71.6 ) ) , we see this tendency at a level which is not quite significant probably due to the large uncertainties in the mass measurements .",
    "we now explore in more detail the significant correlation between the redshift of the cluster and the bcg absolute magnitude found . in order to study this behavior for a fixed mass bin",
    ", we fit the evolution of the bcg luminosity with redshift for three masses bins : clusters with @xmath107 , clusters with @xmath108 and clusters with mass larger than @xmath109 .",
    "these bins have been chosen in order to separate the sample into equal numbers . in figure",
    "[ fig : zmag ] , we can see the different fits to the bcg magnitude - redshift relation for different bins of mass .",
    "the fits can be written as @xmath110 , where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are listed in table [ tab : mrz ] .",
    "@xmath113 [ tab : mrz ]    for comparison , @xcite reported a rate of evolution of the magnitude as a function of the redshift and richness based on their sample up to z@xmath7 0.4 .",
    "@xcite provided fits for six different richness ( @xmath114 ) bins , finding a steeper slope for poorer clusters in concurrence with our results .",
    "their two richest bins corresponds to masses between 2.42 and 3.89 @xmath115 and @xmath10 3.89 @xmath115 respectively .",
    "thus , for our two lowest mass bins , the @xcite results imply    @xmath116 and for our upper mass bin we use the fit @xmath117    the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : zmag ] refers to this fit with the richness estimated from each mass bin .",
    "the slope in the magnitude - redshift relation obtained by @xcite fully agrees with the slope that we find in a much broader range in redshift .",
    "in addition , the evolution of the bcg magnitude with redshift found in this work is also consistent with the one found by @xcite and extends linearly to higher redshift .",
    "one possible effect that could affect these results could come from the fact that , according to the hierarchical scenario of structure formation , galaxy clusters are known to be less massive at higher redshift . in order to demonstrate that the chosen mass bins are narrow enough to be robust against this effect ,",
    "we have color - coded the bcgs according to their host halo mass in figure [ fig : zmag ] .",
    "the two bottom panels ( the two lower and narrower mass bins ) do not show any trend of the mass with either redshift or magnitude and the correlation coefficients are consistent with zero .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the observed redshift trend within each mass bin can not be substantially affected by underlying trends of mass with redshift . the higher mass bin shows an absence of very massive clusters ( @xmath118 ) at @xmath119 due to the real absence of such clusters according to the hierarchical scenario . in this case",
    "the significance of the correlation coefficient between the @xmath56 and the magnitude according to the spearman test is 2.61 , indicating that there could be a weak dependence . in this case",
    ", this effect might make the slope of the relation to look steeper , which does not seem to be the case .",
    "we confirm the existence of the bcg magnitude evolution with redshift at fixed cluster mass extending the redshift range of previous results @xcite .",
    "moreover , because we have shown that this can not be a selection effect or a cluster mass evolution effect , this suggests that bcgs are passively evolving , at least within the redshift @xmath120 and mass range ( @xmath121 ) where our sample is complete .",
    "this result is in agreement with other works supporting the hierarchical merging scenario ( i.e. @xcite ) .    , @xmath108 and @xmath122 from top to bottom .",
    "each panel is color - coded according to the host mass halo mass .",
    "the dotted and solid lines are our fits and the wen et al .",
    "( 2012 ) fits for each of the mass bins respectively . ]",
    "in this paper , we present the first optically selected cluster catalog in the dls . we analyze the spatial , redshift and mass distribution of the detected clusters and compare the clusters with other optical , x - ray , wl and spectroscopic detections in the literature , finding generally good agreement for structures at z@xmath123 0.25 .",
    "when comparing with spectroscopic detections we find a good correlation for the most massive structures and an increase in the distance and redshift offset of the matched structures for less massive detections .",
    "we also find , with high ( @xmath3 ) confidence , that the optical and weak lensing maps are correlated , but with low correlation coefficients because the weak lensing maps are dominated by noise .",
    "we also compare the masses estimated from optical richness and the @xcite mass - richness relation to masses estimated from wl or x - rays finding that the bcf provides a generally good estimator . in general , the dls cluster set can be used as a tool to compare systematics between different methods",
    ". however , catalog users should be aware that very low redshift ( @xmath120.25 ) clusters are missing or biased upward in redshift because their member galaxies are saturated in the dls imaging .    additionally , we inspected and visually classified the corresponding bcg for each cluster to investigate their properties .",
    "we restricted the dls cluster sample to those with @xmath124 within a redshift range of @xmath125 to avoid biases .",
    "this is a wider range of mass and redshift than has been considered in previous work @xcite . to understand the processes that lead to the formation of the bcg",
    ", we examine the relation between bcg redshift and absolute magnitude for different cluster masses .",
    "we confirm the evolution of the bcg luminosity with redshift at fixed cluster mass observed by @xcite and extend it to higher redshift .",
    "in addition , we fully agree with the slope given by @xcite , suggesting that bcgs in clusters with masses @xmath126 have passively evolved since redshift at least @xmath7 0.8 in agreement with the hierarchical scenario @xcite . on the other hand , other observational works @xcite have claimed a difference between bcgs in low - mass clusters and groups and high - mass clusters , with the former being more similar to normal ellipticals .",
    "less massive clusters had formed later in time , not having had time to establish a cool core .",
    "consequently , even though we have shown evidence in this study that bcgs in massive clusters ( @xmath124 ) evolve passively after redshift @xmath7 0.8 , we need larger and complete samples of bcgs down to lower cluster masses to shed light on the primary mechanisms driving evolution in low mass clusters and groups .",
    "next generation optical surveys expected to have large deep areas with very good photometric redshift resolution ( e.g : j - pas , @xcite ; lsst , @xcite ; des , @xcite ; euclid , @xcite , among others ) will provide excellent datasets for such purposes .",

    "<S> we present the first sample of 882 optically selected galaxy clusters in the deep lens survey ( dls ) , selected with the bayesian cluster finder . </S>",
    "<S> we create mock dls data to assess completeness and purity rates , and find that both are at least 70% within 0.1@xmath0 1.2 for clusters with @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we verified the integrity of the sample by performing several comparisons with other optical , weak lensing , x - ray and spectroscopic surveys which overlap the dls footprint : the estimated redshifts are consistent with the spectroscopic redshifts of known clusters ( for @xmath2 where saturation in the dls is not an issue ) ; our richness estimates in combination with a previously calibrated richness - mass relation yields individual cluster mass estimates consistent with available shels dynamical mass estimates ; synthetic mass maps made from the optical mass estimates are correlated ( @xmath3 significance ) with the weak lensing mass maps ; and the mass function thus derived is consistent with theoretical predictions for the cdm scenario . with the verified sample we investigated correlations between the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcg ) properties and the host cluster properties within a broader range in redshift ( 0.25 @xmath0 0.8 ) and mass ( @xmath4 ) than in previous work . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the slope of the bcg magnitude - redshift relation throughout this redshift range is consistent with that found at lower redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> this result supports an extrapolation to higher redshift of passive evolution of the bcg within the hierarchical scenario .    </S>",
