    "as discussed in the main text , the phase diagram we derived from the few - particle green s functions is supported by the asymptotic lines shown in figs .",
    "2a ( inset ) and fig .",
    "4 . we are not aware of any numerical studies of this model that could be used for direct comparison , although it bears mentioning that once @xmath38 is large enough that convergence has been achieved ( see discussion and examples below ) , these results are exact ",
    "there is no approximation involved in obtaining them .",
    "however , additional support for these results can be obtained from studies of spin@xmath130 hamiltonians . through a jordan - wigner transformation @xcite ,",
    "the hamiltonian for spinless fermions studied here can be mapped into : @xmath131.\\ ] ] the case @xmath132 corresponds to ferromagnetic nearest - neighbour ising interaction and frustrating anti - ferromagnetic next nearest - neighbour ising interaction .    for @xmath59 ,",
    "the phase diagram of this model is well - known : it consists of a ferromagnet for @xmath133 and a luttinger liquid otherwise @xcite .",
    "the ferromagnet corresponds to phase - separation in the fermion language , since the magnetization is linked to the density of fermions .",
    "the unpaired fermions phase is reasonably linked to the luttinger liquid , so this line of the phase diagram agrees with other known results .",
    "while we could not find a study of the spin model with @xmath134 , it is expected that an increase in @xmath108 frustrates the ferromagnetic phase and eventually makes it unstable .",
    "we believe that the pairs phase is a charge 2 luttinger liquid , a sort of 1d version of a p - wave superconductor .",
    "such phases are fairly well known @xcite .",
    "as discussed , because the hamiltonian is invariant to translations it is convenient to use the two - fermion states : @xmath135 the method can be trivially extended to systems with disorder because using these translational states is not an essential ingredient of the method .    for a finite - size chain with @xmath136 sites , in order to not double count the states , we must restrict @xmath137 , where @xmath138 if @xmath136 is even , respectively @xmath139 if @xmath136 is odd . in other words ,",
    "when considering the two fermions on the closed ring , we take the distance between them to be the shortest possible `` arc '' , @xmath140 . using @xmath141",
    ", it follows that for any @xmath142 @xmath143    the equations of motion for the two - particle green s functions were derived in the main text . for @xmath144 , and using the notation @xmath145",
    ", they are : @xmath146 for @xmath147 , and finally @xmath148a_{n_{max}-1}=0\\ ] ] a numerical solution is now trivial .",
    "however , we can do better .",
    "first , note that for @xmath149 we have @xmath150 , and so the solution is : @xmath151 this is expected , since @xmath42 is an eigenstate of the full hamiltonian with energy @xmath44 , as can be easily checked .    for any @xmath45 , the equations for @xmath152 can be solved analytically .",
    "their general solution is : @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 are the roots of the characteristic equation : @xmath51 .",
    "we _ choose _",
    "@xmath156 to be the root for which @xmath157 .",
    "this is always uniquely defined for any @xmath158 , since the product of the two roots @xmath159\\ ] ] is 1 .",
    "the solution is now immediate .",
    "the last equation for @xmath160 fixes the ratio of @xmath161 , the solution is then propagated down to @xmath162 , and one uses the first two equations to find @xmath163 and @xmath164 , completing the solution .",
    "these results have a very straightforward physical interpretation .",
    "note that the general recurrence equation for @xmath165 is the same that describes _ two free fermions_. for a given @xmath17 , the two - fermion continuum spans the energies @xmath166 $ ] , where @xmath167 is the free particle energy .",
    "this explains why for energies outside this range @xmath168 , we find the two roots @xmath169 to be real ( when @xmath170 ) , and such that @xmath171 as @xmath172 .",
    "this shows that here the two - particle green s function decays exponentially with @xmath32 , as expected since there are no free two - particles eigenstates at these energies .",
    "the exponentially increasing @xmath173 part is a finite size effect : on a finite chain , the inter - particle distance eventually decreases as @xmath174 . in the limit @xmath175 ,",
    "this contribution must vanish , in other words in the thermodynamic limit we must have @xmath176 as a purely exponentially decreasing function with distance .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the solution must be insensitive to how we end the recurrence relation ( what is the boundary condition ) as @xmath175 .    for certain values of @xmath177",
    ", new eigenstates may appear outside the free two - particle continuum .",
    "these describe bound pairs , therefore we expect their wavefunctions ( and the associated green s functions ) to decay exponentially with the distance @xmath32 between the particles .",
    "this is fully consistent with the previous discussion . in particular , since @xmath178 as @xmath179 , it follows that lower - energy pairs are more tightly bound .    on the other hand , inside the free two - particle continuum , @xmath180",
    ", we find @xmath181 as @xmath170 . as a result ,",
    "the two contributions to @xmath182 become oscillatory functions , underlying the fact that there are freely propagating two - particle eigenstates at these energies",
    ". the interaction will be responsible for scattering leading to phase - shifts , however at these energies the two particles can propagate arbitrarily far from each other , if @xmath183 .    using a finite @xmath33 ( which we are forced to do , for numerical reasons ) , results in @xmath184 , in other words",
    "there is slow exponential decay at these energies as well , but now controlled by @xmath33 .",
    "physically , this is because the finite @xmath33 introduces a `` life - time '' for these particles . as a result ,",
    "if the distances @xmath185 are very large compared to the typical relative distance the two free particles can explore in their lifetime @xmath186 , the probability for the pair to be at such distances decreases exponentially , and so do the green s functions .",
    "it follows that in the thermodynamic limit , we can again take @xmath187 .",
    "then , the solution in the thermodynamic limit is trivial since we only need to solve the equations for @xmath163 and @xmath188 using @xmath189 .",
    "the solution is listed in the main text .",
    "generalization to longer ( but finite ) range interactions is trivial , as is finding the solution for other @xmath28 values .",
    "based on the arguments discussed above , in the limit of an infinite chain we expect the green s functions to decay exponentially at all energies , with an exponent controlled by @xmath33 inside the three - particle continuum , and by the inverse of the distance between @xmath31 and the continuum s band - edge , for energies outside the continuum .",
    "we use three - particle states of total momentum @xmath17 : @xmath84 where @xmath190 .",
    "since we take @xmath3 , the states with @xmath191 become irrelevant and we do need to worry about properly counting them ; because of the finite lifetime , even inside the continuum particles can not travel that far from each other . for a finite chain , however , proper counting is important ( see below ) .        here , @xmath193 is the interaction energy when the three particles are at relative distances @xmath194 from each other .",
    "the remaining terms describe the effect of hopping on the @xmath195 state .",
    "the first two terms come from the hopping of the left - most particle , which changes @xmath196 .",
    "the next two terms come from the hopping of the central particle , which keeps @xmath197 constant , and the last two terms are from the hopping of the rightmost particle , which changes @xmath198 . if @xmath199 then @xmath200 since this hopping process is not allowed for spinless fermions , and similarly for @xmath198 . for @xmath175",
    "we need not worry what happens as @xmath201 , since the green s functions vanish before the particles go so far from each other .",
    "suppose we are interested in @xmath202 and use the shorthand notation @xmath203 .",
    "the resulting infinite ( in the thermodynamic limit ) system of coupled recurrence relations can be solved as follows .",
    "we define the vectors @xmath204{c } a(1,m-1 ) \\\\",
    "a(2,m-2 ) \\\\ \\dots \\\\",
    "a(m-1,1 ) \\\\ \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ] which collect all the green s functions with the same `` relative distance '' @xmath205 .",
    "its dimension is @xmath206 , although for special values of @xmath17 there are further symmetries that can lower it .",
    "for example , at @xmath70 we have @xmath207 and the dimension is halved .",
    "the special property of hamiltonians with only nearest - neighbor hopping is that the resulting equations of motion only link three vectors with consecutive relative distances . in other words , for any @xmath208 , we can recast the recurrence equations as : @xmath209 where @xmath210 are very sparse matrices whose matrix elements are simple functions of @xmath211 that can easily be read off the equations of motion . because we know that all green s functions must vanish in the limit @xmath90 , the solution of this recurrence equation is given by : @xmath212 where the matrices @xmath213 are given by continued fractions : @xmath214^{-1 } \\alpha_m\\ ] ] and can be calculated starting with @xmath215 at a sufficiently large cutoff @xmath38 .",
    "once all these matrices are known , and in particular @xmath216 which links @xmath217 and @xmath218 to @xmath219 , we can use the equation of motion with @xmath220 to find : @xmath221},\\ ] ] from which we can then get all the other propagators .    to illustrate the effect of the numerical parameters @xmath33 and @xmath38",
    ", we analyze the three - particle spectral weight : @xmath222 this is finite for all energies @xmath31 in the @xmath70 , @xmath81 spectrum , and its weight gives the probability of having the three fermions located on three consecutive sites .",
    "just like for @xmath0 , whether a bound trion is the ground - state or not is determined by whether a discrete lorentzian appears below the continuum , or not .",
    "the continuum starts at @xmath223 , where @xmath224 is the gs energy of the @xmath0 case .",
    "if the parameters are such that bound pairs are not stable , then @xmath106 and the three - particle continuum starts at @xmath107 .",
    "however , if a bound pair is stable , then the continuum moves to lower energies , and consists of states where a free particle scatters off a bound pair ( other higher - energy features are also present , but not of interest for our analysis ) .    in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) , we show @xmath225 for @xmath226 and three sets of parameters @xmath227 .",
    "the dashed vertical line shows the expected on - set of the continuum , at @xmath223 [ for these parameters , @xmath228 , see fig .",
    "1c in the main text ] .",
    "clearly , @xmath225 shows a continuum starting at this energy , but there is also a lorentzian peak below it , indicating a stable trion for these parameters .",
    "note that the spectral weight in the continuum depends on the specific broadening @xmath33 and cutoff @xmath38 used .",
    "this dependence can be understood easily .",
    "@xmath38 is the cutoff at which we set the green s functions to zero .",
    "physically , this is equivalent with adding an effective `` interaction '' which becomes infinite if the total relative distance between particles @xmath229 , and is zero otherwise . as is the case for any system in a `` box '' ,",
    "we expect the continuum to be replaced by a set of discrete levels , with a spacing @xmath230 .",
    "these states , however , are broadened by @xmath33 .",
    "this explains why the first curve is much smoother than the second one , even though they have the same @xmath38 . on the other hand ,",
    "the third curve has @xmath38 increased by a factor of two , and indeed there are roughy twice as many oscillations marking the discrete peaks . for any value of @xmath38 ,",
    "the curve becomes smooth if @xmath33 is large enough so that @xmath231 .",
    "as already discussed , physically this means that the lifetime @xmath34 is so short that the particles can not travel up to the boundaries of this potential `` box '' defined by @xmath38 .      below the continuum",
    ", the spectral weight is insensitive to @xmath38 , because the states that appear here ( if any ) are bound well inside this `` box '' .",
    "the broadening @xmath33 is still reflected in the shape of the lorentzian : although not shown entirely in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the peak for the smaller @xmath33 is 5 times narrower and taller , as expected .",
    "this insensitivity to @xmath38 is very convenient , because it means that one can get very good estimates for the energy of strongly bound states using rather small @xmath38 values .",
    "of course , if the binding energy is very small , then one has to increase @xmath38 until convergence is achieved .",
    "it should now be apparent that the method generalizes straightforwardly to any case with an odd number @xmath91 of particles .",
    "we choose the reference location @xmath6 as being that of the central particle , and index states in terms of the absolute values of the relative distances of all other particles @xmath232 with respect to the central particle . in the equation of motion ,",
    "hopping of any of these other particles will increase or decrease its own @xmath233 by 1 , so the `` relative distance '' @xmath234 varies by 1 . if the central particle hops to the right , for example , this increases by 1 all the distances to all particles to its left , and decrease by 1 all distances to all particles to its right .",
    "since there are equal numbers of particles to the left and to the right of the central particle , then @xmath39 is unchanged .    for an even @xmath91 ,",
    "we choose as the reference particle either of the two central particles . in this case , the `` relative distance '' is changed by 1 when any of the particles hop , including the `` central '' one .      in either case",
    ", the recurrence equation can still be cast in the general form of eq .",
    "( [ rec ] ) and can be solved by similar means .",
    "of course , the larger @xmath91 is , the larger is the dimension of @xmath236 , so eventually one runs out of computational power to calculate the continued fractions numerically .",
    "this is the factor that limits what values of @xmath91 can be considered .",
    "[ fig4 ] gives the real time to calculate the spectral weight at one frequency on a 4-core cpu , for systems with @xmath237 and 5 fermions .",
    "as expected , the run times increase quite fast with both @xmath91 and the chosen cutoff @xmath38 .",
    "note that for @xmath237 we showed data for @xmath38 much larger than what is needed to achieve convergence , simply because for smaller values the cpu time becomes independent of @xmath38 , showing that it is determined by other tasks , not by the computation of the continued fractions which is the most time - consuming part at large @xmath38 .",
    "in fact , @xmath238 sufficed to achieve convergence even in the most delicate cases discussed in the main article , namely where a bound state is very close to a continuum ( _ i.e. _ near a dissociation process ) .",
    "as already mentioned , here one needs to use a small @xmath33 and therefore a larger @xmath38 to be able to separate such close - by features .",
    "if the energy of the bound complex is well below the continuum , on the other hand , much smaller @xmath38 suffices and calculations are much faster .    in practice",
    ", it is useful to first use a fairly small @xmath38 to quickly scan a large range of energies to see where the main features are .",
    "of course , one particularly useful characteristic of this calculation is that the spectrum for a given number @xmath91 of fermions must have one or more continua at energies determined by the spectra with fewer fermions , which are known .",
    "this gives not only a chance to validate the computation , but also a very useful indication of where features are expected in the spectral weight .",
    "if a @xmath91-bound complex is stable , its corresponding lorentz peak is below the lowest - energy continuum and must be found by searching for a peak in the spectral weight in the infinite range of energies lying below this lowest continuum . even in this case , one may use perturbation theory as a first guide to where the peak may be . as an example , see line `` 5 , bound '' in fig .",
    "3a which provides an estimate for the energy of the 5-fermion bound complex .",
    "to zero order , its energy is @xmath239 , since a configuration with 5 fermions occupying consecutive sites has 4 nn and 3 nnn pairs . if @xmath177 are comparable to @xmath22 , then one can use perturbation to allow the end fermions to hop one site on and off the end of the complex ; this further lowers the energy by @xmath240 ( note that @xmath241 ) , since the resulting configuration only has 3 nn and 3 nnn pairs .",
    "if needed , 2nd and higher order corrections can be obtained by including further possible configurations , in a standard fashion .",
    "using such guidance plus low-@xmath38 scan of a large range of energies , the rough position of the peak can be found efficiently , after which @xmath38 is increased until the energy of the peak is converged to the desired precision . note that since this peak is a lorentzian with a known broadening @xmath33 , as few as 2 points close to its maximum suffice to extract its maximum and its weight from fitting .",
    "this is why even though for @xmath2 and @xmath238 it takes @xmath242 to calculate the spectral weight at one frequency , one can actually identify the gs energy with high precision within very few minutes , for a given value of the parameters .",
    "this is also why we are confident that this type of calculation can be successfully extended to larger @xmath91 , especially if clusters with more than 4 cpus are used to further speed up the computation .",
    "we stopped at @xmath2 here simply because this value was sufficient to deduce the phase diagram for this model .",
    "we now briefly discuss the generalization to a mix of two different types of spinless fermions , still on a 1d infinite chain .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath243 be their corresponding annihilation operators . for spin-@xmath129 fermions , one can take @xmath244 .",
    "the model hamiltonian we consider is a direct generalization that used in the main text : @xmath245    in other words , each species has both nn and nnn interactions , while the mixed interactions are on - site , nn and nnn . of course , if the two spinless fermions correspond to different spin - projections of the same spinful fermion , and the interactions are spin - independent , then one expects @xmath246 etc .",
    "consider first a mixed pair with a total momentum @xmath17 .",
    "one expects to be able to factorize the two - particle states into analogs of `` singlet '' and `` triplet '' ( with @xmath247 ) states , which should not mix with one another through hopping , so that each should have its own set of recurrence relations .",
    "this is indeed true , however at finite momentum these symmetries get mixed and identifying the proper states requires a bit of work .",
    "the solution is as follows .",
    "we define : @xmath248 where @xmath249 and @xmath250",
    ". then , let : @xmath251 and for any @xmath10 ,        it is now easy to check that the recurrence relations do not mix `` s '' and `` t '' states together , and each set can be solved similarly to that for the spinless @xmath0 case .",
    "this is a double bonus .",
    "first , because it keeps the recurrence equations simpler , which makes the calculation more efficient .",
    "more importantly , one can figure out the symmetry of the bound states that form , based on which green s functions exhibit poles at those energies .",
    "generalization to more particles follows closely .",
    "the main ingredient , namely that a relative distance can be defined , and that hopping only varies it by at most 1 , stays the same .",
    "the complication is that now particles of unlike type can pass by each other , so for example for a three - particle calculation with relative distance @xmath253 , one generally has to include all states like @xmath254 , @xmath255 and @xmath256 .",
    "thus , the dimension of the vectors with a given relative distance is bigger than if the particles were identical .",
    "again , careful consideration of symmetries ( especially at @xmath70 ) lowers the dimension and make the calculation more efficient , besides providing information on the symmetry of the bound states .      the calculation can be carried over to bosons trivially .",
    "the main difference is that one can place any number of bosons on the same site , so there are additional recurrence equations describing states with shorter relative distances than possible for fermions .",
    "the nn hopping insures the same general structure of the recurrence equations , and in fact for the terms where there are no multiple bosons at the same site , the equations are identical with those for fermions in similar configurations .      to obtain this",
    ", one has to combine together the idea of a `` relative distance '' , described above for multiple particles , with that of a `` manhattan distance '' which we introduced in ref . to show how to calculate single - particle green s functions in higher dimensions .",
    "for example , for two particles on a 2d square lattice , one needs two integers @xmath257 to characterize the relative distance between the two particles in states of the form @xmath258 .",
    "some restrictions apply to the allowed values of @xmath259 so that double counting is avoided . for example , we can choose @xmath260 ; if @xmath261 then only @xmath262 is needed , while if @xmath263 , @xmath264 can take both positive and negative values @xcite .",
    "nearest neighbor hopping will link the green s function for this ket to the ones corresponding to kets with @xmath265 and @xmath266 . as a result , here we should choose @xmath267 as a sum of the relative distances projected along all the axes  this is a `` manhattan distance '' characterizing the relative distance between the two particles in this state .",
    "nearest - neighbor hopping then preserves the general structure of linking green s functions with a given @xmath39 to only others with @xmath87 , and the general approach of rewriting the equations of motions in terms of continued fractions carries over . in fact , this problem is very similar in structure to that of 3 fermions in 1d , where we also need two integers @xmath194 to characterize each internal arrangement , and where @xmath86 .",
    "the main difference is that in 2d , @xmath264 could be negative as well , in other words there are roughly twice as many states with a given @xmath39 then for the 3 particles in 1d .",
    "this suggests a corresponding increase in the computational time . in reality , even this increase can be eliminated , if one explicitly works with pairs of @xmath268-wave or @xmath269-wave symmetry . in the former case ,",
    "the green s functions corresponding to a given @xmath270 and @xmath271 are equal , while in the latter case , they have equal magnitude but opposite sign . in either case , the actual number of unknowns is halved . as a result ,",
    "the 2d calculation for either an @xmath268-wave or @xmath269-wave pair is basically equivalent to a 1d calculation for 3 particles .",
    "the generalization to 3 particles is described briefly in the main article . in this case , we need 4 integers to describe the relative positioning with respect to the `` central '' particle ( note that different particles can play this role , for different axes ) . in 1d , 4 integers are needed to describe the relative arrangements of 5 particles . in general , @xmath28 particles in 2d require @xmath103 integers to specify relative positioning from a `` central '' particle , and as such , this calculation maps onto a calculation with @xmath102 particles in 1d . just as discussed above for @xmath272 , at first sight there are more states with the same total @xmath39 in the 2d problem then in the 1d one , because some of the 2d integers could be negative while the 1d ones are all positive . however , if symmetries are properly enforced this overall multiplication factor can be removed , at least at @xmath70 . as a result",
    ", one finds not only the spectrum but also the symmetry of the bound complex ( if , indeed , such a bound complex is stable ) .",
    "this is why in terms of running times for higher - d , a reasonable estimate can be obtained based on running times in 1d .",
    "for example , the 2d , @xmath0 case discussed above is roughly equivalent to a 1d , @xmath81 computation , since in both cases the configurations are characterized by 2 integers .",
    "it follows that stability for trions ( @xmath81 ) and bi - excitons ( @xmath113 ) can be studied very easily in 2d , since it involves problems similar to @xmath2 , respectively @xmath273 in 1d . in 3d ,",
    "study of trions would be equivalent to investigating @xmath273 in 1d , which can certainly be accomplished in a reasonable time on a regular desktop with a 4-core cpu . to study bi - excitons in 3d ( equivalent to @xmath274 in 1d )",
    ", it may be needed to use a bigger cluster to lower the computation time . of course ,",
    "if the bound complex is stable , this will be confirmed by a small @xmath38 run , in an efficient fashion .      in these cases , it is impossible to recast the equations of motion in terms of recurrence equations for consecutive vectors @xmath275 . for longer range hopping , this is because the relative distance will be changed by at least @xmath276 for second - nearest neighbor hopping . even for nearest - neighbor only hopping , in a finite system this simple rule is broken for states with particles separated by maximum allowed distances .",
    "the only exception is for @xmath277 on a chain , where as discussed , the hopping from @xmath160 to @xmath278 is actually mapped into hopping to @xmath279 , up to a phase factor . in all other cases ,",
    "the hopping out of these states with maximally allowed relative distances will map into states which can have quite different @xmath39 values .",
    "one may still obtain a solution for such cases , by solving all of them together as a linear system , instead of factorizing them into a recursive set based on their @xmath39 values . while the dimension of this linear system is much bigger ,",
    "the matrix is extremely sparse and can be dealt with efficiently by various known algorithms .    for an infinite system with longer range hopping ,",
    "if one is interested in bound states , then one can set a quite small cutoff resulting in a reasonable computational task .",
    "for a finite - size chain , one needs some physical intuition to decide what states ( green s functions ) can be removed from the calculation , i.e. how to define a `` cutoff '' .",
    "we are currently investigating such problems ."

    "<S> however , the method generalizes straightforwardly to higher dimensions , longer ( but finite ) range interactions , mixtures of fermions ( including spinful fermions ) and/or bosons , etc . </S>",
    "<S> such problems are of direct interest either in solid state physics , or for cold atoms in optical lattices .    for two - fermion green s functions ( @xmath0 ) </S>",
    "<S> , our method is equivalent to that of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , but is recast in a simpler form which allows , in 1d , for an analytical solution for any finite - range interaction . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , it has a simple generalization for @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we study cases with up to @xmath2 and show that these suffice not only to sort out the stability of few - particle bound states , but also to infer the low density phase diagram .    </S>",
    "<S> consider , then , spinless fermions on a 1d chain with @xmath3 sites , described by the hamiltonian : @xmath4 where @xmath5 removes a spinless fermion from site @xmath6 located at @xmath7 , and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> note that this 1d hamiltonian is not integrable in the sense of having a bethe ansatz solution . </S>",
    "<S> because our solution is not linked in any way to such integrability , it can be generalized to higher dimensions , as already mentioned . to illustrate the main idea behind our solution </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss in some detail the solution for @xmath0 fermions , after which we generalize to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> other possible generalizations , mentioned above , are discussed in the supplementary material @xcite .    because the hamiltonian is invariant to translations , </S>",
    "<S> the total momentum of the pair is a good quantum number . as a result , we work with the @xmath0 states : @xmath9 which describe fermions at a relative distance @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> we define the two - particle green s functions : @xmath11 where @xmath12^{-1}$ ] with @xmath13 and we set @xmath14 . from the lehmann representation : @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the two - particle eigenstates with total momentum @xmath17 , @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this propagator allows us to find the @xmath0 spectrum and also to get information about its eigenfunctions . </S>",
    "<S> its fourier transform latexmath:[$g(m , n;k , t)\\propto \\langle k , m    that if initially the two particles ( with total momentum @xmath17 ) are at a relative distance @xmath20 , they will be at a relative distance @xmath21 after time @xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> matrix elements of the identity @xmath23 lead to @xmath24 . since @xmath25 and @xmath26 </S>",
    "<S> , we get a simple recurrence relation : @xmath27   g(m , n ; k , \\omega ) \\\\+ f(k ) \\left[g(m , n-1;k,\\omega ) + g(m , n+1;k,\\omega)\\right]\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] this is trivial to solve for an infinite chain if one realizes that for any @xmath28 of interest , @xmath29 as @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> this is obvious if @xmath31 is outside the free two - particle continuum where eigenstates , if any , are bound and therefore wavefunctions decay exponentially with @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also true inside the free two - particle continuum . </S>",
    "<S> even though here the wavefunctions are plane - waves , @xmath33 defines an effective lifetime @xmath34 . as such , @xmath35 if @xmath20 is large compared to the typical distance that particles travel within @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the recurrence relation can be solved starting from @xmath37 for a sufficiently large cutoff @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the @xmath0 case can be solved analytically exactly ( see below ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the idea can be used for @xmath1 cases , where a numerical solution is needed . noting that the few - particle green s functions become arbitrarily small as a `` relative distance '' @xmath39 ( to be defined below ) increases , the recurrence relations can be solved propagating the solution from a cutoff @xmath38 towards small @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath38 is then increased until convergence is reached . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of @xmath33 and @xmath38 on the numerical solution are discussed in the supplementary material .    </S>",
    "<S> first , though , we complete the @xmath0 discussion , which has an analytical solution ( for details see @xcite ; we also show there how to deal with a finite - size system in this case ) . at the brillouin zone ( bz ) </S>",
    "<S> edge , since @xmath40 we find : @xmath41 as expected since @xmath42 is an eigenstate of @xmath43 with energy @xmath44 . for any @xmath45 </S>",
    "<S> , we find @xmath46 ^ 2}{\\omega + i \\eta -u_2 + z(k,\\omega)f(k)}\\right]^{-1}\\ ] ] and for any @xmath47 , @xmath48^{n-1}f(k )    g(1,1;k,\\omega)}{\\omega + i \\eta -u_2 + z(k,\\omega)f(k)}.\\ ] ] values for @xmath49 can be obtained similarly . here , @xmath50 is the root of the characteristic equation of this recurrence relation , @xmath51 , for which @xmath52 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that indeed , @xmath53 as @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also easy to check that inside the free two - particle continuum , @xmath55 , we have @xmath56 , so here @xmath57 decays exponentially only because @xmath58 .     for @xmath59 and ( a ) @xmath60 ; ( b ) @xmath61 and ( c ) @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> as the nn attraction is turned on , a bound state splits from the free two - particle continuum shown in ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> it exists at all momenta if @xmath63 , but only for large momenta if @xmath64 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ]    to study the two - particle spectrum , we plot the two - particle spectral weight : @xmath66 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig1 ] ) for @xmath59 , and three values of @xmath44 . by definition </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath67 is finite at energies in the two - particle spectrum , and its value is related to the probability to find the fermions as nn in that eigenstate . if @xmath60 , @xmath67 is finite in the free two - particle continuum , ranging from @xmath68 to @xmath69 if @xmath70 , while at @xmath71 only @xmath72 is an eigenstate , hence the @xmath73-function ( lorentzian ) seen here . as an attractive @xmath44 </S>",
    "<S> is turned on , the @xmath71 peak tracks @xmath44 , and a bound state is pulled below the continuum at nearby @xmath17 values . for @xmath74 , </S>",
    "<S> this bound state exists only near the bz edge , while near the @xmath75 point the weak attraction shifts spectral weight to the bottom of the two - particle continuum but is not enough to push a discrete state below it . for @xmath76 , </S>",
    "<S> the bound state becomes the low - energy state at all @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that , for certain ranges of parameters , bound pairs are only stable in some regions of the bz , which moreover are not necessarily near @xmath70 </S>",
    "<S> . it would be interesting to investigate their effects on various response functions .    however , hereafter we focus on the @xmath70 ground - state ( gs ) . fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]a shows whether in the gs the pair is bound or not , for @xmath77 and @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> ( note that such interactions , attractive at short - range and repulsive at longer - range , appear in systems with highly polarizable ions @xcite ) . for @xmath79 </S>",
    "<S> a bound pair is always stable ; even if it had infinite mass , a nn pair of energy @xmath44 is below the minimum energy of two free fermions , of @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the kinetic energy of the pair further enhances its stability region . </S>",
    "<S> the full line in the inset shows a perturbational estimate for @xmath80 @xcite .    , and ( b ) @xmath81 fermion systems , indicating the nature of the gs . </S>",
    "<S> the inset in ( a ) shows that bound pairs are always stable if @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line is a perturbational prediction . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2],title=\"fig : \" ] , and ( b ) @xmath81 fermion systems , indicating the nature of the gs . </S>",
    "<S> the inset in ( a ) shows that bound pairs are always stable if @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line is a perturbational prediction . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2],title=\"fig : \" ]    this @xmath0 stability diagram , however , has no predictive power for what happens if more fermions are in the system . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if @xmath81 , we expect regions where the gs consists of 3 fermions , of a bound pair plus a fermion , or of a bound `` trion '' . to identify these regions we study @xmath81 green s functions , by direct generalization of the @xmath0 approach . </S>",
    "<S> briefly , for any @xmath83 , we define three - particle states : @xmath84 and three - particle green s functions : @xmath85 recurrence relations for these propagators are generated just as for the @xmath0 case . </S>",
    "<S> if we define a `` relative distance '' @xmath86 , hopping of the outside fermions will link green s functions with a given @xmath39 to those with @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> if the central fermion hops , one of the @xmath88 values increases by one and the other decreases by one , therefore @xmath39 remains the same . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the equation of motion links green s functions with consecutive @xmath89 values , leading to recurrence relations that can be solved in terms of continued fractions of matrices , if we use the insight that propagators vanish as @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> generalization to larger @xmath91 values is now straightforward @xcite .    in higher dimension , we need to combine the `` relative distance '' with the `` manhattan distance '' @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in 2d for @xmath81 , we associate the plane - wave with the coordinates @xmath92 and @xmath93 of the `` central '' particle for that axis . </S>",
    "<S> the other particles coordinates are @xmath94 , @xmath95 , respectively @xmath96 , @xmath97 , where @xmath98 , @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> if we choose @xmath100 then nn hopping links together only green s functions with @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath28 particles in 2d is computationally similar to @xmath102 particles in 1d . in both cases , @xmath103 positive integers </S>",
    "<S> specify the relative positions , and @xmath39 is their sum . </S>",
    "<S> the key observation is that the equations of motion still group into recurrence relations linking only quantities with @xmath89 , allowing for an efficient solution ( for more details , see @xcite ) .    to study the spectrum of the @xmath81 , 1d system , we plot @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> this must have finite spectral weight for @xmath105 , corresponding to a continuum of states describing a fermion far away from a pair . </S>",
    "<S> ( if @xmath106 , this continuum starts at @xmath107 and describes 3 free fermions ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the continuum is the lowest spectral feature , then the gs is either a pair+fermion or three fermions , mirroring the @xmath0 situation . </S>",
    "<S> however , if a discrete state appears below this continuum , then the gs is a stable bound trion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the stability diagram is plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]b and shows a region where trions are stable , at large attractive @xmath44 and weak repulsive @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected since binding a 3rd fermion to a stable pair lowers its energy by roughly @xmath109 , while a free fermion can lower the total energy by at most @xmath110 .     </S>",
    "<S> gs energy ( green circles , label `` 5 '' ) vs. @xmath108 for ( a ) @xmath111 , and ( b ) @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> other lines show the lowest energies of various complexes , and arrows indicate dissociations ( see text for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3],title=\"fig : \" ]   gs energy ( green circles , label `` 5 '' ) vs. @xmath108 for ( a ) @xmath111 , and ( b ) @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> other lines show the lowest energies of various complexes , and arrows indicate dissociations ( see text for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3],title=\"fig : \" ]    the fact that stable trions are found for @xmath81 does not , however , guarantee that they appear at finite concentrations . just as the pair+fermion is unstable to trion formation </S>",
    "<S> , trions may be unstable to bigger bound complexes , if more particles are present . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a study of cases with @xmath113 and 5 fermions proves that trions are actually unstable . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig3](a ) where we plot the energy of the @xmath2 gs vs. @xmath108 ( line marked `` 5 '' ) at @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> the other lines show energies where a continuum could appear , _ eg . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xmath114 is the lowest energy of two pairs plus a fermion , @xmath115 is the lowest energy for a pair plus a trion , etc . </S>",
    "<S> the arrows indicate various dissociations . </S>",
    "<S> arrow 1 shows when a pair becomes more stable than 2 fermions ( @xmath116 ) , while arrow 2 shows when a trion becomes more stable than a pair+fermion ( @xmath117 ) , see figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]a , b . </S>",
    "<S> a trion+fermion is unstable to either two pairs ( at larger @xmath108 ) or a 4-fermion bound complex ( smaller @xmath108 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary between the two is marked by arrow 3 ( @xmath118 ) . </S>",
    "<S> but 4-fermion bound states are not stable either , since @xmath119 ( arrow 4 marks where the 5-fermion bound complex breaks into a pair+trion ) . </S>",
    "<S> below it , @xmath120 is indeed in good agreement with the perturbational estimate for the energy of a 5-bound complex @xmath121 , shown by the dashed line indexed `` 5 , bound '' .    ]    </S>",
    "<S> what happens as @xmath91 increases becomes clear if we realize that arrows 3 and 4 point to essentially the same @xmath108 value . </S>",
    "<S> if more fermions are added , below this @xmath108 we expect a bigger and bigger bound complex  in other words , phase separation occurs and the system splits into a fermion rich and a fermion poor region . above this , a gas of pairs is stable ( plus one trion , if @xmath91 is odd ) . </S>",
    "<S> that this inference is correct is verified by the following argument . </S>",
    "<S> this critical value should be given by the condition that adding two more particles to a fermion rich region ( which changes energy by about @xmath122 , because of extra interactions ) should be energetically favorable to having a bound pair far away . </S>",
    "<S> from @xmath123 we find @xmath124 if @xmath111 , in good agreement with the value @xmath125 pointed to by arrows 3 and 4 .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , based on these few - particles results , we can infer the phase diagram of this model at small concentrations , shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line shows the estimate discussed above , accurate for large @xmath126 ( at smaller @xmath44 , @xmath22 comes into play since the extra fermions need not be fully localized at the edge of the fermion rich region ) . if @xmath127 , the transition is from phase separation to unbound fermions as @xmath108 increases . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown , for @xmath112 , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]b : here each bigger complex is more stable than any smaller ones , if @xmath128 ( arrow ) .    while we are not aware of numerical studies of this model , the good agreement with various asymptotic estimates as well as with known results for spin-@xmath129 hamiltonians @xcite , supports the accuracy of our results . </S>",
    "<S> this work shows that even such a simple model has a rich behavior that can be uncovered with this method .    to summarize , </S>",
    "<S> we have shown how to calculate few - particle green s functions on an infinite 1d chain . </S>",
    "<S> the information obtained from them sheds light on the stability of few - particle bound states . </S>",
    "<S> it also illustrates the dangers of an insufficient analysis  </S>",
    "<S> if we stopped at @xmath81 , we would conclude that trions are stable in a large region of the parameter space , in this model . </S>",
    "<S> analysis for larger @xmath91 shows that addition of more particles leads to instability of trions , and furthermore allows us to find the phase diagram for small concentrations .    </S>",
    "<S> although these results are for a 1d model , as discussed above this method generalizes to higher - d if the hopping is nearest - neighbor only . </S>",
    "<S> this opens the way to study the stability of trions and bi - excitons in realistic lattice models . </S>",
