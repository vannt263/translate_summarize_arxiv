    "although the standard model ( sm ) ckm picture of flavor and cp violation has been confirmed over the last years at the level of ( 10 - 20)%  @xcite , there are in fact hints of discrepancies with respect to some sm expectations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) :    * the measured amount of cp violation in @xmath9 mixing ( @xmath10 ) seems insufficient to explain cp violation in @xmath11 mixing ( @xmath12 ) ; * the time - dependent cp asymmetries in the loop induced decays @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) are measured to be considerably smaller than @xmath10 ; * recent analyses find a @xmath8 mixing phase much larger than the tiny sm prediction .    taking these tensions seriously , a natural way to address them",
    "is to go beyond the sm and to introduce new cp violating phases .",
    "the mssm contains many free parameters that can provide additional sources of cp violation . once",
    "( some of ) these parameters are assumed to be complex , in general several cp violating processes will receive np contributions simultaneously . in the following we consider observables that are sensitive to cp violation in    * @xmath1 amplitudes , like the edms of the electron and neutron , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ; * @xmath2 amplitudes , like the direct cp asymmetry in the @xmath5 decay , @xmath19 or the cp asymmetries in the @xmath6 decay ; * @xmath7 amplitudes , like @xmath12 , that measures the amount of cp violation in @xmath11 mixing or the mixing induced cp asymmetries in @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath10 and @xmath22 , that measure the @xmath9 and @xmath8 mixing phases ; * both @xmath2 and @xmath7 amplitudes , like the time dependent cp asymmetries in @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .      in the following we focus on the phenomenology of a so called flavor blind mssm , a rather restricted framework where the ckm matrix remains the only source of flavor violation , but additional cp violating phases are introduced in the soft sector . in particular , in  @xcite we assumed flavor universal squark masses , flavor diagonal but hierarchical trilinear couplings , but allowed the trilinear couplings to be complex .",
    "we find that in this framework non - standard effects in cp violating @xmath23 observables arise dominantly through the @xmath2 magnetic and chromomagnetic dipole operators .",
    "the corresponding wilson coefficients get np contributions mainly through higgsino - stop loops that are @xmath24 enhanced and proportional to a single complex parameter combination @xmath25 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fbmssm ] we show three examples of the resulting highly correlated effects in low energy observables .     with @xmath15 ( left ) , @xmath19 with @xmath15 ( middle ) and @xmath17 with @xmath15 ( right ) in the fbmssm .",
    "the gray regions correspond to the experimental @xmath26 ranges for @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    with @xmath15 ( left ) , @xmath19 with @xmath15 ( middle ) and @xmath17 with @xmath15 ( right ) in the fbmssm .",
    "the gray regions correspond to the experimental @xmath26 ranges for @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    with @xmath15 ( left ) , @xmath19 with @xmath15 ( middle ) and @xmath17 with @xmath15 ( right ) in the fbmssm .",
    "the gray regions correspond to the experimental @xmath26 ranges for @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    both @xmath15 and @xmath16 , that we evaluate following  @xcite , can depart significantly from their sm expectations .",
    "the effects in these cp asymmetries are strongly correlated and both observables can be brought simultaneously in agreement with the measurements .    the direct cp asymmetry in @xmath5  @xcite is a very suitable observable to look for np effects  @xcite , as it is predicted to be very small in the sm , @xmath27  @xcite . in the fbmssm",
    "values up to @xmath28 can be reached .",
    "furthermore , @xmath15 in agreement with the central experimental value unambiguously implies a positive value for @xmath19 .",
    "the np effects in @xmath15 are also strongly correlated with the edms of the electron and neutron . in our framework , the dominant contributions to @xmath17 and @xmath18 arise from two loop barr - zee type diagrams  @xcite that are also proportional to im@xmath29 .",
    "the desire to explain the measured value of @xmath15 then implies lower bounds of @xmath17 and @xmath18 at the level of @xmath30 cm , only one order of magnitude below the current experimental constraints .",
    "finally we also find large effects in several observables accessible in the @xmath6 decay  @xcite .",
    "in particular , as discussed in @xcite , the two t - odd cp asymmetries @xmath31 and @xmath32 are strongly enhanced with respect to their tiny sm predictions .",
    "the effects in @xmath31 and @xmath32 are highly correlated among themselves and also with the other cp violating observables discussed so far .",
    "concerning cp violation in @xmath7 on the other hand , the leading contributions to the mixing amplitudes for the @xmath11 , @xmath9 and @xmath8 systems are not sensitive to the new phases of the fbmssm .",
    "in fact , only for an extremely light susy spectrum with higgsinos and stops lighter than 200 gev , @xmath12 can be modified by a positive np shift at the level of at most @xmath33 . also @xmath10 and @xmath34",
    "remain essentially sm like , with @xmath35 .    to summarize",
    ", we stress that the combined study of the above considered observables and especially the characteristic pattern of correlations among them constitutes a very powerfull test of the fbmssm framework .",
    "in particular , if a large @xmath8 mixing phase will be confirmed at lhcb , the fbmssm can eventually be ruled out .      in order to generate sizeable effects in @xmath34 in the mssm",
    ", one has to go beyond the minimal ansatz of the fbmssm and introduce not only additional sources of cp violation , but also of flavor violation .",
    "the latter can be present both in the soft masses of the squarks and in the trilinear couplings and they are conveniently parameterized by so called mass insertions ( mis ) . in presence of complex mis , flavor and cp violating gluino - squark - quark interactions arise , that typically give the dominant contributions to fcncs . while left - right flipping mis are strongly constrained by the @xmath36 decay and",
    "can hardly generate effects in @xmath8 mixing , @xmath34 can take values in the entire range @xmath37 if left - left and/or right - right mis are present .",
    "in particular , if both left - left and right - right mis are present simultaneously , contributions to the @xmath8 mixing amplitude are generated that are strongly enhanced by renormalization group effects  @xcite and a large loop function  @xcite .",
    "in such a situation , even for moderate , ckm like values of the mis @xmath38 , huge effects in @xmath34 can be achieved .",
    "in a flavor blind mssm , sizeable non - standard effects in cp violating low energy observables are possible .",
    "in particular cp violating @xmath1 and @xmath2 dipole amplitudes can receive large complex np contributions , leading to highly correlated modifications of the sm predictions of the edms , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath19 and cp asymmetries in @xmath6 .",
    "cp violation in @xmath7 amplitudes however remains sm like , _",
    "i.e. _ one gets only small effects in @xmath12 , @xmath10 and especially in @xmath34 .    to generate large cp violating effects in @xmath7 amplitudes , additional flavor structures in the soft susy breaking",
    "terms are required . as left - left mis",
    "are always induced radiatively through renormalization group running , models predicting sizeable right - right mis are natural frameworks where a large @xmath8 mixing phase can occur . a detailed comparative study of the phenomenology of well motivated susy flavor models showing representative patterns of mass insertions can be found in  @xcite .",
    "i warmly thank the other authors of  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite for the very pleasant collaborations .",
