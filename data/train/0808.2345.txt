    "effective control of transport in artificial micro- and nano - structures requires a deep understanding of the diffusive mechanisms involving small objects and , in this regard , an operative measure to gauge the role of fluctuations .",

    "the fact that the diffusion equation is closely related to the time evolution of the probability density @xmath0 to find a jittering particle at a location @xmath1 at time @xmath2 dates back to einstein s pioneering work on the molecular - kinetic description of suspended particles @xcite .    with this minireview we focus on the problem of the diffusion of small size particles in confined geometries .",
    "restricting the volume of the phase space available to the diffusing particles by means of confining boundaries or obstacles originates remarkable entropic effects @xcite .",
    "the driven transport of charged particles across bottlenecks , such as ion transport through artificial nanopores or artificial ion pumps @xcite or in biological channels @xcite is the better known model where diffusion is determined by entropic barriers .",
    "similarly , the operation of artificial brownian motors @xcite , molecular motors @xcite and molecular machines @xcite also results from the interplay of diffusion and binding action by energetic or , more relevant in the present context , entropic barriers @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of such nanodevices crucially depends on the fluctuation characteristics of the relevant degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "in addition , the interplay of diffusion over entropic barriers and unbiased time periodic drives is responsible for certain paradoxical transport effects , like the recent observation of entropic - diffusion controlled absolute negative mobility @xcite .",
    "although we restricted ourselves to small size particle , we remind the reader that entropic forces surely affect the dynamics of extended chains diffusing on a periodic two ( 2d ) or three dimensional ( 3d ) substrate . a well established example",
    "is represented by the phonon damping of propagating solitons @xcite .",
    "another example of great interest for its potential applications in nanotechnology is the translocation of a long polymer molecule through a pore with opening size comparable with the polymer gyration radius . in this case ,",
    "entropic effects were first predicted to theoretically describe the conformation changes the chain undergoes to move past a conduit constriction @xcite and , then , experimentally observed both in biological @xcite and artificial channels @xcite .",
    "another instance of constrained brownian dynamics that rests , indeed , within the scopes of our minireview , is the so - called single file diffusion .",
    "the motion of an assembly of small size particles in a narrow channel can be so tightly restricted in the transverse directions that the particles arrange themselves into a single file .",
    "the longitudinal motion of each particle is thus hindered by the presence of its neighbors , which act as nonpassing movable obstacles . as a consequence ,",

    "we consider the diffusive dynamics of spherical particles in 2d or 3d pores , or channels , which extend in the @xmath5 direction and possess a periodically varying cross section .",
    "these channels are supposed to be symmetric with respect to a reflection on the channel axis in 2d ( like those sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : tube ] ) , or to any rotation about the channel axis in 3d .",
    "the channels are assumed to be delimited by rigid , smooth walls .",
    "the half width of the channel is described by the well - behaved boundary function @xmath3 .",
    "the channel walls do confine the particles inside the channel but , otherwise , do not exchange energy with them .",
    "in particular , we do not consider the possibility of adsorption of particles at the walls .",
    "since we will disregard any rotatory motion of the particles about their centers of mass , we need not specify particle - wall contact forces .",
    "moreover , the radius of the particles is supposed to be smaller than the minima of @xmath3 ( channel bottlenecks ) , so that the particles are not restricted to stay within a confined region of the channel , but rather may diffuse everywhere along the channel .",
    "the motion of particles that are immersed in a fluid medium may be influenced by various types of forces .",
    "we will here restrict ourselves to the discussion of small radius ( almost pointlike ) particles , whose presence does not significantly modify the free motion of the fluid around them ( laminar flow regime ) .",

    "we only deal the case of fluids with homogeneous temperature @xmath14 and velocity fields that are almost constant on the particle scale @xmath12 . as a consequence , to insure thermalization at temperature @xmath14 it suffices to set @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the boltzmann constant and @xmath17 is a standard 3d gaussian noise with @xmath18 and @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "other forces acting on the particles , like hydrodynamic interactions among different particles and between single particles and the wall , will be neglected @xcite .",
    "this simplification , in particular , requires a sufficiently low particle density .",
    "finally , an external force @xmath21 may act on the particles describing e.g. the gravity force , or in the case of charged particles , an electrostatic force .",
    "we further specialize our discussion to constant longitudinal external forces pointing in the direction of the symmetry axis of the channel .",
    "the dynamics of the center of mass @xmath22 of a single particle is then governed by newton s equation of motion @xmath23 + \\sqrt{2 \\gamma k_\\mathrm{b } t } \\,\\vec{\\xi}({t } ) , \\label{eqm}\\ ] ] where we explicitly allow for a possible time - dependence of the fluid velocity field . for microparticles moving with typical velocities of the order of 1 cm / s , the inertial term @xmath24 in eq .",

    "the equation of motion ( [ eqm ] ) can be simplified as @xmath26 this langevin equation is equivalent to the following fokker - planck equation @xcite for the probability density @xmath27 of a particle to be found at the position @xmath1 at time @xmath28 : @xmath29 here @xmath30 denotes the corresponding probability current density @xmath31 these equations have to be supplemented by appropriate boundary conditions , which will be discussed in the following subsection .",
    "the channel is typically characterized by two boundary regions : a transverse boundary naturally results from the presence of the walls , whereas a longitudinal boundary is required to account for the channel length .",
    "the probability flux normal to the boundary in the presence of a rigid hard wall must vanish .",
    "thus , to prevent pointlike particles from leaving the channel or being adsorbed at the walls , we must impose that @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the unit vector normal to the wall at point @xmath1 .",
    "note , however , that the center of mass of a spherical particle of finite radius @xmath12 may approach the wall only up to a distance @xmath12 , so that for finite size particles the boundary conditions ( [ bcw ] ) applies on an appropriate inner surface parallel to the channel walls @xcite .",
    "various kinds of boundary conditions exist that regulate the inward and outward probability flows at the ends of a channel @xcite . if the channel connects large , well mixed particle reservoirs , then constant probability densities @xmath34 may be assigned at the channel ends .",
    "this leads to dirichlet boundary conditions of the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote respectively the left and right endpoints of the channel .",
    "a more detailed description of the particle flow into and out of a channel can be achieved by relating flux and probability densities at @xmath38 , that is @xcite @xmath39 here , positive ( negative ) constants @xmath40 correspond to partially absorbing ( emitting ) boundaries . as special cases , reflecting and absorbing boundaries correspond to @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "finally , for an infinitely long channel the periodic boundary conditions @xmath43 are more appropriate @xcite . in the case of velocity fields which are constant with respect to time or vary periodically in time , these boundary conditions allow for stationary flux carrying solutions @xcite .",
    "in order to set the stage , we consider first the ideal case where the diffusion of a particle in a periodically corrugated channel can be assimilated to the diffusion on an energetic landscape represented , for simplicity , by a 1d periodic substrate @xmath44 with period @xmath45 , namely @xmath46 . such a model is often employed to model , for instance , nanotube @xcite and zeolite diffusion @xcite .",

    "notably , as @xmath4 approaches the depinning threshold @xmath57 the mobility curve ( [ eq : mobility - formula ] ) jumps from zero ( locked state ) up to close @xmath75 ( running state ) . correspondingly , the diffusion coefficient ( [ eq : diffusion - formula ] ) develops a diffusion excess peak , i.e. with @xmath76 , consistently with numerical observations in ref .",
    "@xcite . both the mobility step and the @xmath77 peak get sharper and sharper as @xmath14 is lowered @xcite .",
    "the same conclusions apply in the presence of inertia ( i.e. for particles of finite mass @xmath47 ) @xcite , as well , with the difference that the relevant depinning threshold shifts towards lower values ( proportionally to @xmath48 as @xmath78 @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we emphasize that the above formulas for the nonlinear mobility and the effective diffusion coefficient retain their analytic structure also when generalized to anomalous ( sub)-diffusion on a 1d substrate , by merely substituting the normal diffusion constant @xmath79 by the fractional diffusion constant occurring in the corresponding fractional diffusion equation @xcite .",
    "in the limiting case of pointlike particles with zero interaction radius diffusing in constrained 2d or 3d geometries , elastic contact particle - particle interactions can be neglected .",
    "as long as hydrodynamically mediated interactions can also be neglected , see e.g. @xcite , the confining action of the channel walls is modeled by the perfectly reflecting boundary conditions ( [ bcw ] ) .    in the presence of a constant external force pointing in the channel direction , an overdamped brownian particle suspended in a static medium",
