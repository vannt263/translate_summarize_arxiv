    "type  ii - plateau sne ( sne  ii - p ) form a well - defined family characterized by a `` plateau '' in the optical light curve , where the luminosity remains nearly constant for a period of @xmath7100 days , and the presence of prominent p - cygni hydrogen lines in the spectrum .",
    "they constitute a subclass of the core - collapse sne ( ccsne ) which includes type ib , type ic , and other subclasses of type ii sne originated by the violent death of stars with initial masses greater than 8 @xmath6 @xcite and sharing , in general terms , the same explosion mechanism .",
    "it has been shown that sne  ii - p are the most common type of sne in nature , amounting to @xmath7 60% of all ccsne .",
    "apart from their astrophysical importance in connection with stellar evolution and the physics of the interstellar medium , additional interest on sne  ii - p has recently arisen from the fact that they have been established as good distance indicators with potential application to cosmology , independent of type ia sne @xcite .",
    "massive stars may suffer considerable mass loss during early phases of their evolution , due to strong stellar winds or transfer to binary companions .",
    "thus , they may lose part or all of their outermost envelope of unprocessed hydrogen and helium .",
    "therefore , the vast diversity observed among ccsne is related with the properties of the progenitor star . in the current picture , sne  ii possibly have the least massive progenitors of all ccsne subtypes which retain a significant fraction of their external hydrogen layers . this picture is combined with hydrodynamical models of sne  ii - p , which show that a red supergiant progenitor with an extensive h envelope is necessary in order to reproduce the plateau - shaped light curves .",
    "recent direct detection of the progenitors of several sne  ii - p have confirmed this prediction @xcite .",
    "there is general agreement that the explosion of a massive star is originated by the collapse of its central parts into a neutron star or black hole when the iron core is formed at the end of the star evolution , and further nuclear burning no longer provides thermal pressure to support the star .",
    "however , the mechanism of the energy deposition in the envelope still remains unknown in spite of the intensive theoretical modeling done in recent years ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the approach usually followed to model supernovae is to decouple the explosion in two independent parts : a ) the core collapse and formation of the shock wave , and b ) the ejection of the envelope .",
    "based on the analysis of the propagation of the shock wave through the envelope , independently of how the shock is formed , it is possible to study the observational outcome of the explosion such as light curves and spectra .",
    "this approach has been extensively used and it has led to the conclusion that the main factors influencing the outcome are the explosion energy and the progenitor structure .",
    "observationally , sne  ii - p show a wide range of plateau luminosities ( @xmath8 ) and durations ( @xmath9 ) , expansion velocities ( @xmath10 ) , and nickel masses ( @xmath11 ) @xcite .",
    "the morphology of the light curve ( lc ) of sne  ii - p has been shown to be connected with physical properties of the progenitor object such as ejected mass ( @xmath12 ) , explosion energy ( @xmath13 ) , and pre - supernova radius ( @xmath14 ) . the relations between physical parameters and observables ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) were first derived analytically by @xcite and then generalized by @xcite .",
    "numerical calibrations of these relations were then given by ( ln83 and ln85 hereafter , respectively ) based on a grid of hydrodynamical models for different values of @xmath12 , @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite applied such calibrations to a set of @xmath7 20 sne  ii - p observations and thereby derived masses , radii and explosion energies for their sample . however , these studies have not been fully satisfactory .",
    "as was noted in @xcite and @xcite , some of the problems of inferring physical quantities from the relations of ln83 and ln85 are : 1 ) the lack of good - quality data , 2 ) the use of simplified relations between ill - defined and hard - to - measure photometric and spectroscopic parameters , and 3 ) the fact that some of the models are based on simplified physical assumptions .",
    "some of the weaknesses of the ln83 and ln85 models are that they did not include the effect of nickel heating in their calculations , the use of old opacity tables , the neglect of any effect from line opacities , and the initial pre - supernova models adopted . with the aim of addressing these problems and gaining a better knowledge of the pre - supernova properties of sne  ii - p , we have 1 ) enlarged the data set of spectra and light curves for 33 sne  ii - p @xcite , and 2 ) developed our own hydrodynamical model .",
    "this allows us to perform a comparison between models and data in a consistent way .",
    "the development of our hydrodynamics code started in 2006 and is part of mb s phd thesis . in the interim since the beginning of the work there have been important advances in the field .",
    "for example , performed a detailed analysis of sn  1999em and also studied how several physical parameters affect the lc . in that work , the author provided relations between physical and observed parameters which are valid only for sne  ii - p with similar properties to those of sn  1999em .",
    "in addition @xcite calculated a set of modeled lc and spectra of sne",
    "ii - p for different masses , metallicities , and explosion energies , using initial models obtained from stellar evolution calculations .",
    "they employed their models to describe the dependence of plateau luminosity and duration on explosion energy and progenitor mass .",
    "nevertheless , the relations they found are simple and easy to apply _ only _ in the extreme case of no @xmath4ni production .",
    "when @xmath4ni is considered , the relations involve more parameters , which hinders their applicability to obtain physical parameters from observations .",
    "more recently , @xcite studied the dependence of the properties of sn  ii - p ejecta on explosion energy and pre - supernova stellar evolution model .",
    "they found that the main - sequence mass of sne  ii - p can be contrained using two measurements : ( a ) the photospheric velocity at 15 days after shock breakout , which is a good indicator of the explosion energy , and ( b ) the width of the nebular phase o  i @xmath156303 - 6363   line as an indicator of the helium - core mass and thereby of the mass of the star in the main sequence .",
    "other works have also explored the effect of several physical parameters on the lc and other properties of sne  ii - p @xcite , although without attempting to derive relations between physical and observed parameters . in recent years , there has been a number of works which analyzed the physical properties of individual sne  ii - p based on hydrodynamical models .",
    "in addition to the comparison with hydrodynamical models , there is an alternative way of deriving progenitor masses of sne  ii - p . that is , using pre - supernova images to search for the progenitor star , and measuring its brightness and color to derive a mass in connection with a stellar evolution model .",
    "currently , there are three sne  ii - p with a firm detection of the progenitor and @xmath7 17 without a positive detection @xcite .",
    "the latter cases are still useful since they provide upper limits to the progenitor masses .    at this stage",
    "there are three sne  ii - p with hydrodynamical masses which have been studied in pre - supernova imaging ( namely , sn  1999em , sn  2004et and sn  2005cs ) .",
    "as noted by , in all cases the mass estimated by hydrodynamical models is higher than the estimate or upper limit given by pre - supernova imaging .",
    "this discrepancy poses a very interesting and unsolved problem which is necessary to study .    in this work",
    ", we present our one - dimensional , flux - limited lagrangian hydrodynamical code which is used for modeling bolometric light curves of sne  ii - p . in general the hydrodynamic modeling of sne  ii - p is easier than the one of other ccsne because the former explode in a very low - density environment @xcite and they possess extended , nearly spherically symmetric hydrogen envelopes which smooth out possible inhomogeneities arising from differences in the explosion itself @xcite . in addition , at least during the optically thick plateau phase , we expect a photosphere radiating as a `` dilute '' blackbody whose properties are mainly driven by the photospheric temperature @xcite .",
    "we employ the usual hypothesis that the explosion can be decoupled into the collapse of the core and the ejection of the envelope .",
    "the energy which is transferred to the envelope ( denoted by us as `` explosion energy '' ) plays the role of a coupling parameter between the internal and external problems . the processes which control the envelope ejection and the supernova radiation",
    "do not depend on how the energy is transferred to the envelope as long as this process occurs during a short enough time and in a small enough region near the core .",
    "this means that for the purpose of modeling light curves it is possible to assume the core as a point - like mass and energy source @xcite .",
    "thus , our model is unable to describe details of the complex explosion mechanism .",
    "the aim of developing our own code is to have available a simple , easy and fast model to study , in a consistent way , the observed and physical parameters that determine the plateau phase for a sample of 33 sne ii - p which will be presented in a forthcoming paper . in this work we present a detailed model for the prototypical sn  ii - p 1999em , as test case to show the consistency of the model .",
    "it will not be our goal in the future to craft specific models for each object but to present a general study of the properties of the whole sample of sne  ii - p .",
    "a description of our numerical method , micro - physics and pre - supernova models is given in section  [ sec : constitutive ] .",
    "as a first step in our comparison with data , in section  [ sec : sn99em ] we analyze the case of the prototype sn  1999em , and we discuss how our model compares with previous hydrodynamical studies of this object . in section  [ sec : lowmass ] we test the feasibility of fitting the observations of sn  1999em with low mass models , consistent with the upper limits obtained through pre - supernovae imaging in connection with stellar evolution models .",
    "this analysis also shows the sensitivity of our bolometric lcs on the variation of physical parameters .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we give our conclusions .",
    "our supernova models are computed by numerical integration of the hydrodynamical equations assuming spherical symmetry for a self gravitating gas .",
    "the radiation transport is treated in the diffusion approximation with the flux - limited prescription of @xcite .",
    "the explosion is simulated by injecting a certain amount of energy during a very short time as compared with the hydrodynamic time - scale near the center of the progenitor object .",
    "this energy induces the formation of a powerful shock wave that propagates through the progenitor transforming thermal and kinetic energy of the matter into energy that can be radiated from the stellar surface . to calculate shock waves , we include , as usual , an artificial - viscosity term in the equations of moment and energy .",
    "the equations and numerical method used are discussed in (   [ sec : equations ] ) . in   [ sec : constitutive ] we give a brief description of the constitutive relations used in our code . the energy deposited by radioactive decay",
    "is discussed in   [ sec : gamma ] .",
    "the initial models are described in   [ sec : initialmodel ] .",
    "a discussion of the approximations used in our calculations is given in ",
    "[ sec : assumption ] .",
    "finally , in   [ sec : model_obs ] we describe which parameters of the model are suitable to compare with observations .",
    "our code follows a one - dimensional , lagrangian prescription that solves for the variables : radius ( @xmath16 ) , velocity ( @xmath17 ) , density ( @xmath18 ) and temperature ( @xmath19 ) as a function of the lagrangian mass coordinate @xmath20 , using the following equations which simply express conservation laws :    @xmath21    @xmath22    @xmath23    @xmath24    @xmath25    here , @xmath26 is the specific volume , @xmath27 is the total pressure ( of gas and radiation ) , @xmath28 is the artificial viscosity which is included in the equations to spread the pressure and energy over several mass zones at the shock front .",
    "there are many expressions for the artificial viscosity , all dependent on the velocity gradient , which aim at providing a convenient interpolation scheme between unshocked and shocked fluid .",
    "we adopt the expression given by @xcite .",
    "@xmath13 is the internal energy per unit of mass ( of gas and radiation ) , @xmath29 is the energy deposited by the radioactive decay of nickel as we describe in   [ sec : gamma ] .",
    "we do not consider other sources of cooling or heating in equation  ( [ eq4 ] ) , such as losses due to neutrino processes or energy released by thermonuclear reactions .",
    "even if neutrinos are very important in the formation of the shock wave as the explosion depends noticeably on the efficiency of their energy transfer , most of them are emitted before the shock wave reaches the stellar photosphere , so they have no effect on later epochs of the sn evolution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the energy released by explosive nucleosynthesis is much less than the energy of the shock wave as has been previously established [ ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath19 is the temperature of both matter and radiation , @xmath30 is the rosseland - mean opacity and @xmath31 is the luminosity . finally , @xmath32 is the so - called `` flux - limiter '' , included in the equation of radiative transfer in the diffusion approximation to ensure a smooth transition between diffusion and free - streaming regimes to assure causality .",
    "the expression adopted for @xmath32 is ,    @xmath33    where    @xmath34    the quantities @xmath13 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath30 are functions of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and chemical composition .",
    "further details on these relations are given in ",
    "[ sec : constitutive ] .    as boundary conditions we use @xmath35 near the center ( at @xmath36 , where typically we adopt @xmath37 ) , and @xmath38 at the surface ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "we discretize the previous equations using a space - centering discretization with the extensive quantities evaluated at the interfaces and the intensive quantities in the midpoints of the grid zones .",
    "two time steps are adopted in each cycle : one to advance the velocity , and the other to advance the material state variables .",
    "the time step is chosen depending on limitations of stability and accuracy ( see the discussion below ) .",
    "special care is taken in the centering of the opacity used in the discretization of equation  ( [ eq5 ] ) in order to prevent numerical noise to appear due to the propagation of the radiation flow at the steep front where the opacity changes significantly @xcite .",
    "we use an explicit scheme for the integration of the hydrodynamic equations , but a semi - implicit scheme for the temperature , similar to the one used by @xcite .",
    "the equations are linearized in @xmath40 and solved iteratively for each time step using the tridiagonal method .",
    "the discretization typically uses 300 mesh points , with a finer sampling for the outer layers typically smaller than @xmath41 .",
    "this value was chosen based on tests performed with our model and following previous works @xcite which show that the early light curve is sensitive to the mass zoning in the outer layers when a coarse grid is used .",
    "given that we are using an explicit hydrodynamic scheme , the time step should be chosen as a fraction of the minimum of the courant condition for all zones in order to achieve stability .",
    "we note that we have also imposed additional conditions on the time step : we have required that changes in temperature , density and flux over one time step be less than 5% .",
    "the formation of the shock wave ( sw ) following core collapse is simulated by artificially adding internal energy ( `` thermal bomb '' ) almost instantaneously in the central region of the core .",
    "we usually set a mass cut of @xmath42 which is the material assumed to collapse and form a neutron star or black hole .",
    "specifically , we employ an exponential function both in mass and in time to distribute the injected energy across several layers and some time steps , which helps to improve the numerical treatment . with the scale factors used in this work for the exponential functions almost all of the explosion energy",
    "was completely injected in a shell of 0.1 m@xmath43 and within less than 1 minute , i.e. a short time compared with the hydrodynamical time scale .",
    "although there may be some differences in the velocity and temperature profiles during the shock propagation on the scale factors used .",
    "our values were chosen such that the differences in the velocity profiles using this value or lower values were not significant .",
    "we have also tested explosions generated by injecting kinetic energy and we have obtained similar results . the latter method , however , leads to very short numerical time steps , and therefore to slower calculations .",
    "we have checked the accuracy of our calculation method by testing the conservation of energy .",
    "the total amount of energy is conserved within @xmath44% but if we consider the conservation of energy between two consecutive time steps , this is even better , within 4 @xmath45 .",
    "we consider it very acceptable for our purposes .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) is calculated using simple expressions for @xmath19 , @xmath18 , composition , and for the ionization degrees of hydrogen and helium corresponding to local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "therefore , the degree of ionization is determined by solving the corresponding set of saha equations for ionization of hydrogen and the first and second ionization of helium .",
    "ionization of heavy elements is neglected in our eos ( but , of course , it is taken into account in the calculation of the opacity ) . the degeneracy pressure is also included in the eos .",
    "we tested our results using a more sophisticated eos , such as the one available from the los alamos tables @xcite , and we did not find any significant differences with respect to the results obtained using our simple eos .",
    "this is expected because of the low densities attained in most of the layers of the models .",
    "the rosseland mean opacities , @xmath30 , used in our calculations are derived using the opal opacity tables ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . as these tables are given for @xmath46 k , we complement them with the opacity table provided by @xcite for lower temperatures which includes molecular opacities",
    "the tables are interpolated to each other in order to guarantee a smooth transition at @xmath47 k.    these tables allow us to calculate opacities for several metallicities . also , for a fixed metallicity , different mixtures of h , he , c and o can be used .",
    "although in this work we adopt a fixed value of @xmath48 , departures from this value ( as expected in the inner regions of the object ) are taken into account as excesses of c and o with respect to the values of the adopted metallicity , at the expense of he .",
    "figure  [ fig : opal ] shows the opacity given by the tables as a function of temperature for @xmath48 and different densities .",
    "the range of temperature shown corresponds to the values reached during the evolution of a sn  ii - p while the values of density are restricted to those achieved during the plateau phase .",
    "also shown in the plot is the contribution to the opacity from electron scattering .",
    "note that electron scattering is the dominant source of opacity for @xmath49 k and @xmath50 gr @xmath51 .",
    "the rosseland mean opacity includes scattering and absorption processes .",
    "scattering is the dominant process in the supernova ejecta during the plateau phase when the densities are @xmath50 ( see figure  [ fig : opal ] ) , and this will be so until most of the electrons recombine with ions and absorption processes become an important source of opacity . on the other hand , in rapidly expanding envelopes where large velocity gradients are present , the rosseland mean opacity underestimates the true line opacity @xcite , which hinders the estimation of the actual opacity in the outermost ( recombined ) layers .",
    "another effect that is not included in the calculation of @xmath30 is the non - thermal excitation or ionization of electrons which are created by compton scattering of @xmath52-rays emitted by radioactive decay of @xmath4ni and @xmath4co .",
    "the lte ionization used in the calculation of @xmath30 considerably underestimates the true ionization .",
    "the correct way to treat these effects is to calculate the actual contribution of non - thermal ionization to the opacity and to include the expansion opacity of lines .",
    "however , such treatment is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we adopt an alternative approach to the problem that has been extensively used in the literature which consists in using a minimum value of the opacity ( or `` opacity floor '' ) new : to partially solve the shortcoming in the rosseland mean opacity .",
    "given the dependence of the opacity on composition , usually two values of the opacity floor are used : one for the h - rich envelope material and another for the metal - rich core .",
    "the opacity at each time and mesh point is chosen as the maximum value between the tabulated rosseland mean opacity and the opacity floor for the corresponding composition .",
    "values of the opacity floor should be based on contributions to the opacity which are not included in the rosseland mean opacity tables .",
    "there are differences in the values adopted in the literature .",
    "for example , adopted a value of 0.01 @xmath53g@xmath54 for the whole structure .",
    "@xcite used minimum values for the bound - free and bound - bound opacities of k@xmath55= 9 @xmath56 y @xmath53g@xmath54 and k@xmath55= 1 @xmath57 z @xmath53g@xmath54 , where y and z denote the mass concentration of helium and heavy elements . note that it is needed to add scattering and free - free absorption effects to the latter in order to obtain the rosseland mean opacity .",
    "@xcite employed 0.05 @xmath53g@xmath54 for the envelope material , and 0.1 @xmath53g@xmath54 for the metal - rich core material . and @xcite used a value of 0.25 @xmath53g@xmath54 for the helium - rich core , and 0.01 @xmath53g@xmath54 for the hydrogen - rich envelope .",
    "we do not intend to be exhaustive but the examples above provide a summary of the values adopted in the field of sne ii .    in this work ,",
    "the minimum opacity values adopted are : @xmath58 @xmath53 g@xmath54 for the envelope material , and @xmath59 @xmath53g@xmath54 for the metal - rich core material .",
    "these values were chosen based on a comparision performed between our code and the stella code using the same initial model provided by @xcite .",
    "note that stella is an implicit hydrodynamic code that incorporates multi - group radiative transfer , and which additionally uses different opacity tables and includes the effect of lines opacities      the radioactive decay of @xmath4ni @xmath60 @xmath4co @xmath60 @xmath4fe constitutes a relevant source of energy which heats the envelope of the supernova .",
    "several studies of sne  ii - p have usually ignored the contribution of such component during the early sn evolution and have only considered it beyond the end of the plateau phase .",
    "such approach would be correct only if @xmath4ni were very deeply concentrated in the ejecta , in which case the local deposition of gamma rays is a good approximation because gamma photons can hardly diffuse out the regions where they are formed .",
    "nevertheless , as was shown in studies of sn  1987a , there is no reason to assume this type of @xmath4ni distribution , and therefore we need to calculate the diffusion of gamma rays from the location where they are emitted to the outer regions . to calculate this , we solve the gamma - ray transfer in the gray approximation for any distribution of @xmath4ni , assuming that gamma rays interact with matter only through absorption .",
    "it has been shown by comparison with monte carlo simulations of type ia supernovae that the complex scattering process between gamma rays and electrons can be satisfactorily approximated as an absorptive process @xcite .",
    "the value for the gamma - ray opacity that we adopt here is @xmath61",
    "@xmath62 g@xmath54 , where @xmath63 is the number of electrons per baryon .",
    "the rate of energy per gram released by the ni - co - fe decay is    @xmath64 \\;{\\rm erg\\ ; g}^{-1 } \\,{\\rm s}^{-1},\\ ] ]    where @xmath65 days and @xmath66 days are the mean lifetimes of the radioactive isotopes . the amount of energy deposited at each point is given by the solution of the gamma - ray transfer multiplied by the previous expression . in figure  [ fig : depo ] we show the gamma - ray deposition for the case of a polytrope with index @xmath67 , initial mass of @xmath68 and different initial radii , assuming a constant distribution of @xmath4ni up to @xmath69 .",
    "note that the diffusion of gamma rays from the region where they form becomes more noticeable as the object becomes more extended and diluted .",
    "the possibility to use an arbitrary distribution of @xmath4ni allows us to study different types of mixing and their effect on the lc .",
    "we have found , as shown in  [ sec : tail ] , that radioactivity becomes an important source of energy even during the plateau phase if we allow extensive @xmath4ni mixing .",
    "there are two different types of initial ( or pre - supernova ) models : those coming from stellar evolution calculations ( or `` evolutionary '' models ) , and those from non - evolutionary calculations where the initial density and chemical composition are parameterized in a convenient way . in this work",
    "we use double polytropic models in hydrostatic equilibrium as non - evolutionary pre - supernova models .",
    "although a single polytrope may represent very well the envelope of the pre - supernova object , the inner , dense part which is expected for this type of objects is not well reproduced .",
    "one way to improve this situation is to consider two polytropes : one representing the inner dense core , and the other accounting for the outer extended envelope . as initial composition",
    "we use parametric chemical profiles with mixing between layers of different chemical composition ( see figure  [ fig : comp ] of section  [ sec : hydro ] for sn  1999em ) .",
    "mixing is expected to occur during the explosion due to hydrodynamical instabilities which can carry the hydrogen very deep into the core and the @xmath4ni out into the hydrogen envelope as previous studies of sn  1987a have shown .",
    "unfortunately , in our one - dimensional prescription we can not properly take into account this effect . to ameliorate this",
    "we implicitly include this effect by imposing mixing in our initial chemical profile .",
    "it is important to note that even if mixing is expected only after the shock propagation , the effect on the dynamics of imposing it at the initial time is not noticeable until the shock breakout , when the recombination front recedes into the ejecta .    in order to calculate numerically a double polytropic model ,",
    "it is necessary to solve the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium and mass conservation assuming a polytropic approximation where the pressure has a dependence on density of the form : @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is a constant and @xmath72 is the polytropic index .",
    "two different polytropic relations with different indices ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) and constants ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) are adopted to mimic the characteristic structure of a red supergiant . to calculate the composite polytrope , the previous equations are numerically integrated outward from the inner border ( stellar core ) to a pre - selected point ( fitting point ) using the internal polytropic relation .",
    "a second inward integration is done from the outer border ( stellar surface ) to the fitting point using the external polytropic relation .",
    "the problem is equivalent to a two - point boundary condition for the case where there are unknown free parameters at both ends of the domain . in our case ,",
    "the free parameters are @xmath73 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , while the external index is fixed to @xmath77 . starting from initial guesses , the values of the free parameters",
    "are iteratively sought so that the solution joins smoothly at the fitting point .",
    "this process is performed using a shooting method .",
    "once the values of @xmath73 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are found , the density ( or pressure ) distribution and mass distribution can be calculated .",
    "the initial temperature profile is calculated in an iterative fashion using our eos to ensure hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this prevents the formation of a spurious shock wave .    using this method a variety of initial models in hydrodynamical equilibrium",
    "can be calculated by changing the fitting point and the boundary conditions for a given mass , radius and central density , which allows us to study how the internal structure of the initial model affects the lc .    alternatively to the parametric initial model we have tested our code using initial models from different stellar evolution calculations .",
    "we found several features in the resulting lc which are not present in the observations , as was previously noted in the literature .",
    "specifically , several bumps and wiggles appear during the plateau phase .",
    "regardless of the differences among evolutionary models , all of them have the common characteristic of showing a sharp boundary between layers with different chemical composition and a steeper jump in density between the helium core and the hydrogen envelope than in our double polytropic models .",
    "these two characteristics are the ones responsible for the unobserved bumps in the lc .",
    "we note that a possible reason for the relatively poor results we obtained from evolutionary initial models may be the use of one - dimensional calculations which can not take into account effects that produce mixing , such as rayleigh - taylor instabilities .",
    "this point deserves further scrutiny , although it is beyond the scope of this paper .    in summary",
    ", we decided to use double polytropic initial models based on the following facts : ( 1 ) we have generally found a better agreement with observations using our parameterized profiles , in accordance to previous studies ; ( 2 ) there is a limited set of pre - supernova models from stellar evolutionary calculations available to us ; ( 3 ) parameterized initial models allow us to easily vary physical properties and study their effect on the lc , which is critical for our goal of studying a large sample of sne .",
    "however , we emphasize that the choice of polytropic initial models makes the connection with the structure of a progenitor star difficult to assess .",
    "several approximations are made in the equations of radiation hydrodynamics .",
    "we assume that the fluid motion can be described by one - dimensional , radially symmetric flow .",
    "the explosion mechanism of core - collapse sne is not well known but it may be a very asymmetric process .",
    "however , for this particular subtype of sne with very extended hydrogen envelopes the asymmetries expected from the explosion mechanism itself appears to be smoothed .",
    "this is supported by recent spectropolarimetric studies @xcite .",
    "we use the equilibrium diffusion approximation to describe the radiative transfer .",
    "this approximation assumes that radiation and matter are strongly coupled with a single characteristic temperature and a spectral energy distribution described by a black body function ( bb hereafter ) .",
    "the approximation breaks down at shock breakout and at late phases when the ejecta is completely recombined and the object becomes transparent .",
    "fortunately , during the plateau phase  which is our main interest , this approximation is adequate .",
    "also note that non - lte calculations of sn  ii spectra show that deviations from lte have significant effects on the lines but not on the overall continuum @xcite . at late phases , for sne that experience little interaction with the interstellar medium ,",
    "as is the case of sne  ii - p , the bolometric luminosity can be simply approximated as the luminosity deposited by the radioactive decay of @xmath4co , at least during the early part of the radioactive tail .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the luminosity declines obeying an exponential law with a very similar rate to that of the decay of @xmath4co .",
    "no attempt to apply our model beyond @xmath7180 days is done .    during the transition between plateau and radioactive tail ,",
    "the envelope is fully recombined and the notion of a photosphere loses meaning .",
    "thus , this transition regime is poorly described with our radioactive transfer prescription and therefore a detailed description of this phase can not be assessed here . as stated above ,",
    "we have performed a comparison of our calculations with those of the stella code , obtaining an excellent agreement between the bolometric luminosities derived by both methods .",
    "this is very satisfactory considering that the stella code involves a more sophisticated treatment of the radiative transfer by solving these equations using a multi - group prescription and including the effect of line opacities .",
    "one of the main motivations for this work is the unprecedented database of bvi light curves of @xmath7 30 sne which offers the opportunity to significantly improve our understanding of sne  ii - p and their progenitors . given that our code produces bolometric light curves",
    ", we need to compute bolometric luminosities for our data set . in @xcite",
    "we found a tight correlation between bolometric correction and colors which allowed us to calculate bolometric luminosities from @xmath78 colors with an uncertainty of only @xmath79 dex light curves from our models but the only available atmosphere model that we have at this point is the black body spectral distribution .",
    "however , as several studies have shown and as can be seen in figure  3 of @xcite , the luminosity of sne  ii - p depart considerably from a bb behavior very early in the sn evolution , which hampers the comparison . ] .    another critical parameter to compare with observations is the photospheric velocity yielded by our models .",
    "expansion velocity estimates from the minimum of several spectral lines ( h@xmath80 , fe ii @xmath81 , h@xmath82 and h@xmath83 ) of our dataset were given by @xcite .",
    "since each line forms at a different shell , it is not straight forward to compare the observed velocities with photospheric velocities .",
    "@xcite got around this problem and derived congruent calibrations between the velocity derived from the absorption minimum of such lines and the photospheric velocity using two independent atmosphere models ( @xcite and @xcite ; e96 and d05 hereafter , respectively ) .",
    "as noted by @xcite h@xmath82 provides a very good proxy to the photosphere velocity as it is not highly saturated as h@xmath80 , and is present over most of the sn evolution . therefore ,",
    "in the comparisons with our models , we chose to use the calibration given by @xcite for this particular line .",
    "however , in spite of the satisfactory behavior of this calibration in the high - velocity regime ( @xmath84 km s@xmath54 ) , for lower velocities the atmosphere models fail to reproduce the behavior shown by the data ( see figure  9 of * ? ? ?",
    "thus , we decided to include also in our comparison the velocities estimated from the fe  ii @xmath81 line which is present at later phases of the sn evolution when the velocities are below the limit imposed by the calibration of hydrogen lines .    for consistency with the atmosphere models ,",
    "we define the photospheric position as the layer where the total continuum optical depth is @xmath85 .",
    "note that to calculate @xmath86 we do not include the opacity floor because such minimum is only included to take into account line effects , and therefore is a bound - bound opacity that does not contribute to form the continuum . with this definition ,",
    "the photosphere follows the recombination wave as we show in section  [ sec : crw ] .",
    "note that this behavior of the photosphere is due to the fact that electron scattering is the dominant source of opacity ( see figure  [ fig : opal ] ) .",
    "had we included the opacity floor in the definition of @xmath86 , the @xmath85 surface would be pushed well above the recombination front .",
    "we remark that with this definition , the photosphere is essentially the surface of last scattering",
    ". however , the surface where the continuum is actually formed is located in a deeper layer called the `` thermalization depth '' and this is due to the dominance of the electron scattering over the absorption processes @xcite . with our simple prescription of radiative transfer",
    "we can not accurately determine the location of the thermalization depth because there radiation decouples from matter .",
    "note that the color temperature , determined by a black body fit to the broad - band photometry , is nearly coincident with the temperature of the thermalization depth but is greater than the effective temperature defined by @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the photospheric radius .",
    "in @xcite we derived a calibration between @xmath89 and color based on the e96 and d05 models . using this calibration we study the evolution of @xmath89 for our sample of sne  ii - p and",
    "we compare it with @xmath89 derived from our code .",
    "in preparation for our comparison with the sample of sne  ii - p in a forthcoming paper , we analyze here the case of the prototype sn  1999em to show the details of how our code works .",
    "the choice of this object was motivated by the fact that this is one of the best observed sne of its type both in terms of wavelength coverage and temporal sampling .",
    "in addition , sn  1999em was previously modeled with two different hydrodynamical codes which provided consistent physical parameters of the pre - supernova model . here , we start our study using our code and initial parameters consistent with such studies (   [ sec : hydro ] ) . in   [ sec : compsn99em ] we discuss how our results compare with previous studies of sn  1999em .",
    "it is interesting to note that currently there is an unsolved discrepancy between the mass of the progenitor object derived from hydrodynamical models , and estimates from pre - supernova images in connection with stellar evolution models .",
    "for example , for sn",
    "1999em the hydrodynamical mass is close to 19 @xmath6 ( this corresponds to the mass of the progenitor at the time of explosion , so the zero - age main sequence star would be even greater ) while from pre - supernova images an upper limit of 15 @xmath6 was derived for the progenitor star at the zams . in order to address this problem , in   [ sec : lowmass ] we study the possibility of fitting the light curve and velocity evolution of sn  1999em with lower values of the envelope mass .",
    "sn  1999em was discovered shortly after the explosion on 1999 october 29 ut by the loss program @xcite .",
    "based on the expanding photosphere method ( epm ) study by @xcite , we assume sn  1999em exploded 3 days before discovery .",
    "this is consistent with the constraint imposed by a negative detection ( limiting magnitude 19 ) on an image obtained on 1999 october 20 ut . in order to compare with our model",
    ", we corrected the times elapsed since explosion by time dilation based on the redshift of the host galaxy .",
    "we adopted the cepheid distance of 11.7 mpc given by @xcite to compute bolometric luminosities as explained in @xcite using photometric data obtained at _ cerro tololo inter - american observatory _",
    "( ctio ) , _ las campanas observatory _ ( lco ) , and the _",
    "european southern observatory _ ( eso ) at _ la silla _ @xcite .      in this section",
    "we use a pre - supernova model with initial parameters consistent with the optimal hydrodynamical model of . specifically , we adopt an initial mass of 19 @xmath6 , radius of 800 @xmath90 , and explosion energy of @xmath0 foe ( 1 foe= @xmath91 erg ) .",
    "this energy was released as thermal energy near the core of the object in a very short time scale as compared with the hydrodynamic time scale of our model .",
    "we also assume a nickel mass of @xmath92 @xmath93 which was determined by the luminosity of the radioactive tail .",
    "this parameter is quite different to the nickel mass of @xmath94 @xmath93 used by which was determined using the quasi - bolometric luminosity given by .",
    "their luminosity was based on the integration of only @xmath95 photometry with a constant value of @xmath96 dex added to take into account the infrared luminosity , while our bolometric luminosity is based on a quantitative study of the bolometric correction for sne  ii - p ( see   [ sec : assumption ] ) .",
    "note also that our value for the nickel mass is closer to the estimate of @xmath97 @xmath93 given by @xcite . in the following analysis , we denote this model as m19r8e1.25ni56 . + in our calculations we remove the central @xmath98 @xmath6 which is assumed to form a neutron star . the initial density profile as function of mass and radius for model m19r8e1.25ni56",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : dens ] .",
    "note that the initial structure is composed of a dense core and an extended envelope characteristic of a red supergiant .",
    "the chemical composition profiles are shown in figure  [ fig : comp ] .",
    "the outer parts of the envelope , @xmath99 , have a homogeneous composition with a mass fractions of @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath48 . from there inward ,",
    "hydrogen and helium are mixed in order to prevent a sharp boundary between the h - rich and the he - rich layers .",
    "such sharp boundaries are characteristic of stellar evolution models but fail to reproduce the observations .",
    "note that we allow h to mix very deep inside the core and @xmath4ni is mixed out in the envelope until @xmath715 @xmath6 .",
    "this type of mixing is presumably due to rayleigh - taylor instabilities that occur behind the shock front , as is obtained in multi - dimensional hydrodynamic calculations and supported by studies of sn  1987a .",
    "the presence of h in the core leads to a smooth transition between the plateau and the radioactive tail .",
    "the distribution of @xmath4ni to external layers helps to reproduce a plateau as flat as that observed in sn  1999em ( see section  [ sec : crw ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : lc ] shows a comparison between the bolometric light curve ( solid line ) obtained with our code for model m19r8e1.25ni56 , and the observations of sn  1999em ( dots ) .",
    "the luminosity due to @xmath4ni @xmath60 @xmath4co @xmath60 @xmath4fe ( dashed line ) is also shown .",
    "note the very good agreement between model and observations .",
    "the largest differences appear during the earliest phase and the transition to the radioactive tail . at the earliest epochs our bolometric corrections have the largest uncertainties because during this time the uv flux which is the main contribution of the luminosity is not well constrained as noted in @xcite . during the transition between the plateau and the radioactive tail , the diffusion approximation breaks down because the object is almost completely recombined and the photosphere is not well defined . during the tail , the bolometric luminosity is completely determined by the luminosity of radioactive decay , which makes our calculations more reliable . although not shown here , our model shows that the shape of the light curve at the end of the plateau is very sensitive to the properties of the core , such as mixing and the form of the density transition between the helium - rich core and the hydrogen - rich envelope . on the other hand , the presence of an outer atmosphere can affect the shape of the light curve ( lc ) at the earliest stages . during these epochs , and until the hydrogen recombination sets in , the lc samples the outermost layers as the photosphere is located far out in the object ( see   [ sec : crw ] ) .",
    "so , even it was possible to find a better fit to the observations by modifying the innermost or outermost structures , such efforts are rendered meaningless due to the uncertainties introduced by our approximations .",
    "figure  [ fig : velo ] shows the photospheric - velocity evolution of our model compared with observed photospheric velocities as explained in   [ sec : assumption ] .",
    "we have also included in the plot the spectroscopic velocities measured from the absorption minimum of the fe  ii @xmath81 line @xcite .",
    "note the very good overall agreement between model and observations .",
    "fe  ii velocities match quite well the model photospheric velocities except at the latest times .",
    "however , it is important to remark that the photospheric velocity is to be considered a good discriminator between models only at the early phases of the evolution while the object is not completely recombined .",
    "this is because , line velocities become poor photospheric velocity indicators with time , and the photosphere begins to lose its meaning in our models as the ejecta becomes nearly completely recombined at the end of the plateau .    as shown in figures  [ fig : lc ] and [ fig : velo ] we obtain a remarkably good agreement with observations ( bolometric light curve and photospheric velocity evolution ) for sn  1999em despite the simplifications used in our code .",
    "note that in spite of the mismatch between model and observations during the early lc , the photospheric velocities , which are better determined than the lc , show a good agreement at such epochs .",
    "these results are very encouraging and give us confidence in the hability of our code to infer physical parameters , to study their effect on the observed quantities , and ultimately to understand the physics of sne  ii - p .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we describe in some detail the evolution of the sn for this particular model . at a glance",
    ", the lc is distinguished by three phases : a ) an outburst followed by strong cooling , b ) a plateau , and c ) a radioactive tail .",
    "each phase is essentially determined by the interplay between the main heating and cooling mechanisms .",
    "we thus focus our discussion on these processes along the sn evolution . as a reference ,",
    "table  [ tbl-1 ] gives a summary of some properties of the model at characteristic times during the evolution .",
    "even though some uncertainties may arise on the detailed propagation of the shock wave due to the assumed mixing and energy injection , and also on the shock breakout because of the adopted radiative transport , we think that it is instructive to provide a description of the processes which occur during such phases .",
    "we emphasize that the details of the shock propagation do not directly affect the resulting lc and photospheric velocities , which we are mainly interested in modeling .",
    "the initial phase of shock breakout is discussed in   [ sec : sw ] , the adiabatic - cooling phase where the homologous expansion is reached is addressed in   [ sec : ac ] , the cooling and recombination phase is described in ",
    "[ sec : crw ] , and finally the radioactive - decay processes that power the tail are explained in ",
    "[ sec : tail ] .",
    "a powerful shock wave begins to propagate outward through the envelope when we artificially inject energy near the center of the star ( assumed to occur at @xmath102 ) .",
    "this energy is initially released as internal energy , and part of it is rapidly transformed into kinetic energy ( e.g. , by @xmath103  days , the total energy is approximately equally divided between kinetic and internal energy ) .",
    "the velocities acquired by matter are so high that they exceed the local speed of sound , leading to the formation of a shock wave .",
    "the shock wave heats and accelerates the matter depositing mechanical and thermal energy into successive layers of the envelope until it reaches the surface , where photon diffusion dominates the energy transfer , and energy begins to be radiated away .",
    "figure  [ fig : profiles ] shows the effect of the shock wave propagation on different physical quantities ( velocity , density and temperature ) inside the star .",
    "the shock front manifests as a sudden change in these quantities . as the shock moves outward ,",
    "the material behind is accelerated and heated .",
    "note that the outermost layer , with a sharp decline in density , acquires very high velocities .",
    "it represents a small fraction of the star .",
    "it is also clear from the velocity profiles that the inner parts of the object are decelerated .",
    "this deceleration is due to the interaction of the dense core with the extended hydrogen - rich envelope .",
    "the same figure also shows the changes in radius for different shells . from this",
    "we can deduce the location of the shock front at any time as that of the innermost shell which has constant radius .    at @xmath104  days",
    ", the shock wave reaches the surface of the object , which produces the first electromagnetic manifestation of the explosion ( although neutrinos and gravitational waves escape well before ) .",
    "the effective temperature and bolometric luminosity suddenly rise and reach their maximum values a few hours after breakout , specifically , at @xmath105  days with values of @xmath106  erg  s@xmath54 and @xmath107  k. at these temperatures , the peak of the emitted spectrum is in the uv range .",
    "also note than the color temperature is even higher than the effective temperature , as mentioned in section  [ sec : assumption ] .",
    "hereafter , the star begins to expand and cool very quickly , leading to an increase in photospheric radius and a decrease in temperature in the external layers .",
    "the bolometric luminosity abruptly decreases but , according to the decrease in effective temperature and consequent shift of the emission peak to longer wavelengths , the luminosity in the optical range increases . as a result , a sharp peak in bolometric luminosity and temperature",
    "is produced , as shown in figure  [ fig : ltinc ] .",
    "for example in our model we obtain a decrease of @xmath108 dex in luminosity only @xmath109 hours after peak brightness . during this time the total energy radiated is @xmath110  erg , emitted essentially as a uv flash .",
    "the short duration of the breakout explains why so few sne  ii - p have been observed during this phase .    at temperatures as high as those left by the passage of the shock wave ,",
    "the stellar matter is completely ionized which implies that the breakout is accompanied by a strong increase in opacity .",
    "the position of the photosphere during the outburst nearly coincides with the outermost shell .",
    "this behavior continues until the onset of recombination .",
    "therefore , at early stages previous to recombination , the velocity of matter in the photospheric position samples the very high velocities of the outermost layers and reaches values close to @xmath111  km  s@xmath54 .    from the energetics point of view , by @xmath103  day",
    "the total energy is approximately divided in equal proportions between internal , dominated by radiative contribution , and kinetic components .",
    "short after breakout the kinetic energy completely dominates the energetics ( the energy radiated away at any given time is less than @xmath108% of the total energy ) .",
    "it is possible to estimate the average velocity during the shock wave propagation : given that the shock wave takes @xmath112  days to emerge and considering a radius of @xmath113  cm ( 800  @xmath90 ) , we obtain an average speed of @xmath114  km  s@xmath54 .",
    "it is also interesting to calculate the expected time for breakout using the analytic expression given by @xcite ,    @xmath115^{1/2 }   \\,\\ , { \\rm hr},\\ ] ]    where @xmath116 is the initial radius , @xmath117 is the ejected mass , and @xmath13 is the explosion energy . using the values for our initial model we obtain @xmath118  days , in good agreement with our numerical calculation .",
    "the breakout is followed by a violent expansion , resulting in the cooling of the outermost layers . during expansion",
    ", only a small fraction of the photon energy can diffuse into the surroundings .",
    "therefore , it is possible to consider the cooling process to be approximately adiabatic and this approximation remains valid while the time - scale for radiation diffusion is much longer than the expansion time - scale , increases with time while the diffusion time - scale , @xmath119 , decreases because @xmath120 .",
    "thus , there is a time after which the condition for this approximation breaks down . ] .",
    "note that there are two mechanisms to cool a sn : ( a ) loss of photons or diffusion cooling , and ( b ) its own expansion or `` adiabatic cooling '' .",
    "if one of these processes dominates we say that the cooling is carried out by that process . in our model , more than 90% of the decrease of internal energy is due to adiabatic cooling up to 18 days after the explosion , when the first layers with neutral hydrogen appear .",
    "after that , diffusion cooling begins to be significant and the adiabatic cooling phase comes to an end .",
    "the internal temperature ( and internal energy ) decreases almost adiabatically , i.e. proportional to @xmath121 due to the dominance of the radiative term , and quickly reaches a value near the recombination temperature of hydrogen .",
    "quantitatively , the effective temperature goes from values close to @xmath122  k at the time of the burst when the matter is totally ionized , to @xmath123  k five days later . at these temperatures",
    "hydrogen begins to recombine . at the same time",
    ", the luminosity reaches @xmath124  erg  s@xmath54 and the photospheric radius rapidly increases to @xmath125  cm .",
    "after that , the luminosity decreases slightly as a result of the slower decrease in temperature and continuous increase in radius . by day 18 , when the first layers of neutral hydrogen appear , we have @xmath126  k , @xmath127  erg  s@xmath54 , and @xmath128  cm .",
    "note the slight change in luminosity , of only @xmath129 dex , between day 7 and 18 .",
    "a few days after breakout , the acceleration of the material comes to an end and the expansion becomes homologous .",
    "the matter reaches velocities of the order of @xmath130  km  s@xmath54 in the outermost layers and the object enters a state of free expansion where forces of pressure and gravitation do not have any dynamical effect on the system .",
    "the homologous regime is characterized by a constant velocity in each layer , a linear growth of the radial coordinate with time ( @xmath131 ) and a density distribution decreasing with time as @xmath132 . this behavior is clearly shown in figure  [ fig : profiles ] for @xmath133 days and in figure  [ homovelo ] .",
    "the nearly constant shape of the density and temperature profiles at late times are a result of the expansion being approximately homologous .",
    "this is also evident in the linear behavior of the radial coordinates for different mass shells .",
    "the condition of constant velocity is very nearly satisfied for each shell , although the transition between acceleration and homologous expansion happens at slightly different times for different mass shells ( see figure  [ homovelo ] ) .    as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : sw ] , at the time of breakout the internal energy of the envelope is small compared to the kinetic energy .",
    "moreover , the object expands by a factor of @xmath7 17 to a radius of @xmath134  cm , before it becomes transparent .",
    "thus , most of the internal energy left by the shock passage is degraded by the adiabatic expansion , and only a small residual will be released as observable radiation in the following phase .",
    "the appearance of regions with neutral hydrogen determines the onset of a recombination wave ( rw ) .",
    "the duration of the rw is related to the total hydrogen mass and how deep hydrogen has been mixed in the initial model . as time goes on ,",
    "hydrogen recombination occurs at different layers of the object as a wave propagates inward ( in lagrangian coordinate ; see figure  [ fig : profilesxot ] , top left ) . because the opacity is dominated by electron scattering",
    ", it strongly decreases outward the recombination front ( figure  [ fig : profilesxot ] , top right ) , increasing the transparency of these layers and allowing the radiation to easily go away .",
    "consequently , the internal energy ( mostly of the radiation field ) is efficiently radiated away , and the temperature drops sharply from @xmath7@xmath135  k to @xmath7@xmath136  k at the recombination front ( figure  [ fig : profilesxot ] , bottom left ) . in other words , a cooling wave associated with the transparency and induced by a recombination wave propagates through the envelope .",
    "this is usually called `` cooling and recombination wave '' ( crw ) .    in our model",
    "the recombination begins approximately at day 18 .",
    "after that , a crw develops which moves inward in mass until all the matter is completely recombined by day 120 when the recombination front arrives at the innermost layers of the h - rich envelope ( at @xmath1372 @xmath6 for our model ) , and the luminosity suddenly drops , defining the end of this phase .",
    "the propagation of the crw is clear from a glance at figure  [ fig : profilesxot ] where the evolution of the fraction of ionized hydrogen and temperature profiles as a function of mass for selected times are shown .",
    "note also the behavior of the opacity ( see figure  [ fig : profilesxot ] , top right ) which depends strongly on the ionization state of the matter . in our model ,",
    "a strong drop in the opacity of the outer layers is seen at day @xmath718 , which leads to a considerable decrease in the optical depth of these layers and an inward drift in mass of the photosphere  defined at a fixed optical depth of @xmath138 .",
    "the photosphere begins to follow the crw , as shown in figure  [ fig : profilesxot ] where the points indicate the photospheric position .",
    "it is important to note that we define the position of the photosphere using only continuum opacity sources , i.e. excluding the opacity floor ( see section  [ sec : assumption ] ) .",
    "the photosphere , as defined here , is nearly coincident with the outer edge of the crw .",
    "therefore it is just the location of the photosphere with respect to the crw what sets the value of the photospheric temperature close to the temperature of hydrogen recombination ( @xmath139  k ) .",
    "however , note that the effective temperature does not necessarily have a constant value .",
    "since the effective temperature is defined as @xmath140 and the luminosity remains nearly constant outside the recombination front ( see figure  [ fig : profilelum ] ) , any changes in effective temperature are related to changes in photospheric radius .    the crw divides the object in two distinct regions : ( a ) an inner zone which is hot , optically thick and ionized , and ( b ) an outer zone which is relatively cold , optically thin and completely recombined .",
    "matter in the inner zone is opaque : radiative transfer is too inefficient to produce any appreciable flow of energy ( this would be strictly fulfilled if @xmath4ni were confined to the innermost layers ; see the discussion below ) and the matter cools down almost adiabatically . on the other hand ,",
    "the external layers are transparent and practically do not radiate .",
    "therefore , it is within the crw where almost the entire radiant flux is released .",
    "when matter passes through the crw , particles begin to be cooled by radiation , emitting more light than they absorb , and the radiant flux increases .",
    "this way , the radiative flux emerging from the crw front carries away internal energy of the matter that is cooled by the wave .",
    "more details on the properties of the crw are given by .",
    "note that the bulk of the radiation does not diffuse to the photosphere ; the photosphere instead moves inward , allowing the radiation to escape sooner than it would for a photosphere fixed at the outer boundary of the ejected mass .",
    "that is , the recombination process is responsible for the energy release during this phase .",
    "it should be noted that most of this energy comes from the energy deposited by the shock wave and not from the recombination itself . in order to test the previous statement , we ran our code without including the energy released by recombination of ions with electrons .",
    "no appreciable change was found ; quantitatively , the differences between both calculations are less than 0.04 dex during all the evolution .",
    "we have included a figure in the electronic edition ( figure  17 ) showing this comparison .",
    "note , however , that in model m19r8e1.25ni56   where we assumed an extended @xmath4ni mixing , the flux of energy inside the crw is not negligible ( see the left panel of figure  [ fig : profilelum ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the photosphere meets regions with radioactive material earlier than in the case where @xmath4ni is confined to the innermost layers .",
    "therefore , the energy deposited by radioactive decay provides additional power for the lc .",
    "a different behavior is seen when @xmath4ni is confined to the innermost layers ( inside @xmath141 @xmath142 ; see the right panel of figure  [ fig : profilelum ] ) . in this case , the statement that the energy flux inside the crw is very small is fulfilled at least until day @xmath7110 where the radiative diffusion of the radioactive decay from the central layers begins to dominate . at earlier times , it is possible to see the outward diffusion of radioactive energy .",
    "note also that for both models the luminosity outside the front is nearly constant .",
    "the assumption of extended mixing was necessary in order to obtain a plateau as flat as the one observed for sn  1999em .",
    "figure  [ fig : lcni ] shows a comparison of the bolometric lc for three cases : 1 ) with extended @xmath4ni mixing , 2 ) no mixing , and 3 ) without @xmath4ni . for case 1 ) , @xmath4ni begins to affect the lc by day @xmath735 while for case 2 ) the effect of nickel heating is delayed until day @xmath775 . on the other hand , in the former case",
    "there is a less direct energy deposition at the center of the object , and the plateau declines earlier and steeper to the tail than in case 2 ) .",
    "our assumption of mixing of @xmath4ni into the hydrogen envelope is not unreasonable as shown in studies of sn  1987a .",
    "however , it is important to mention that found an excellent agreement with observations of sn  1999em by confining @xmath4ni to the innermost layers and good agreement with observations of sn  1987a assuming moderate @xmath4ni mixing .    the evolution of the velocity of matter at the photospheric position @xmath143 , the photospheric radius ( @xmath88 ) and the mass above the photosphere ( @xmath144 ) are shown in figure  [ fig : vrm ] .",
    "initially , the photospheric velocity evolves rapidly , the photospheric position follows a linear behavior , and there is very little mass above the photosphere . later on , when the recombination sets in , @xmath88 begins to differ noticeably from the linear behavior , the mass above the photosphere increases , and @xmath143 decreases because it samples increasingly inner , slower material .",
    "finally , when all the matter is recombined , @xmath88 and @xmath143 sharply turn down and the luminosity undergoes a rapid decrease .",
    "note , however , that the photospheric radius does not drop immediately .",
    "this is due to the heating caused by radioactive decay which produces some ionization of the gas . on the other hand ,",
    "the luminosity undergoes a rapid decrease to values close to the luminosity of radioactive decays .",
    "if there was no @xmath4ni ( case 3 ) the sn luminosity would abruptly vanish at this point , as shown with a long - dashed line in figure  [ fig : lcni ] .    in conclusion ,",
    "the crw has a duration of @xmath7@xmath145  days .",
    "the luminosity experiences a small change during the crw propagation . in order to produce a plateau as flat",
    "as that observed for sn  1999em , we need to invoke ni mixing in the h - rich envelope .",
    "thus , the plateau can be seen as a combination of crw properties plus some additional energy provided by radioactivity .",
    "defining , from an empirical point of view , the plateau phase as the period of time when the luminosity remains constant within 0.5  mag of the value at day 50 , its duration is @xmath146 days , and the total energy emitted during this phase is @xmath7@xmath147  erg .",
    "note , that with such definition the plateau phase includes the final stages of the adiabatic cooling phase as well .",
    "the late behavior of the lc ( at @xmath148 days ) is dominated by the energy released from radioactive decay . without radioactive material ,",
    "the luminosity would abruptly vanish when hydrogen gets completely recombined as shown in figure  [ fig : lcni ] .",
    "instead , the observed lc decreases to values close to the instantaneous rate of energy deposition by the radioactive decay ,    @xmath149    the decline of the lc at @xmath148 days is nearly linear in concordance to the exponential decline of the radioactive decay law .",
    "that is , the diffusion time for optical photons becomes small enough to radiate away the decay energy instantaneously , while the gamma - ray optical depth is still sufficiently large in order to allow a nearly complete local deposition of the decay energy .",
    "the bolometric luminosity in this part of the lc is a direct measure of the ni mass synthesized in the explosion .      in this section ,",
    "we compare our results with those of previous hydrodynamical studies of sn  1999em . as mentioned in section  [ sec : sn99em ] , there are two previous hydrodynamical studies of sn  1999em : one given by @xcite ( bbp05 hereafter ) and another by ( u07 hereafter ) . in table",
    "[ tbl-2 ] , we summarize the physical parameters obtained for sn  1999em in the three studies along with the distance , explosion time and the chemical composition assumed in each model .",
    "it is interesting to note that the three studies employ initial density distributions and chemical composition distributions of non - evolutionary models . in our work",
    "we assume h and he profiles very close to those adopted by u07 , yet a very different @xmath4ni distribution .",
    "while we assume an extended , uniform mixing of ni ( see figure  [ fig : comp ] ) , u07 confined @xmath4ni to the innermost layers ( see their figure  2 ) . in the case of bbp05 , h and he were assumed to be uniformly mixed throughout the envelope and a radial distribution of @xmath4ni up to @xmath715 @xmath6 was adopted ( see their figure  9 ) .",
    "therefore , our @xmath4ni distribution and the resulting @xmath4ni mass are in better agreement with those of bbp05 than those of u07 .",
    "we also note that the mass of the compact remnant  which is left aside from the calculations  is different in all three works .",
    "we assume a compact remnant of 1.4 @xmath6 while u07 assumed 1.58 @xmath6 and bbp05 removed everything within a radius of @xmath150 .",
    "the approaches used in each work are very different .",
    "u07 used a hydrodynamical code with a one - group approximation for the radiative transport , including non - lte treatment of opacities and thermal emissivity , non thermal ionization , and expansion opacity .",
    "their calculations , although involving a more sophisticated radiative transfer treatment , yielded bolometric light curves as in our code . however , the procedure to produce the observed bolometric light curve for sn  1999em was quite different in both cases . while u07 based their calculations on the integration of @xmath95 photometry with a constant value of @xmath96 dex added to take into account the infrared luminosity , we derived @xmath151 bolometric luminosities from color - dependent bolometric corrections .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the inclusion of the @xmath31 and @xmath12 bands in the calculation of the bolometric correction during the tail phase is very important and it most likely leads to the difference in the nickel mass estimated in this work and in u07 .",
    "bbp05 , in turn , used a multi - group hydrodynamical code which allows to calculate lc in different photometric bands .",
    "this code also included the expansion opacity effect .",
    "therefore , bbp05 were able to compare their model with @xmath95 lc separately without being affected by the uncertainties in the calculation of bolometric luminosities .",
    "as shown in table  [ tbl-2 ] , the parameters yielded by our calculations are intermediate between those estimated by bbp05 and u07 .",
    "the largest differences are 2.6 @xmath6 in mass , 500 @xmath152 in radius , 0.3 foes in energy , and @xmath153 in @xmath4ni mass .",
    "it is quite satisfactory that our simple prescription for the radiative transfer yields physical parameters similar to those obtained from more sophisticated codes .",
    "however , it should be taken into account that ( a ) the models and methods used in each study are quite different , ( b ) there are differences in assumed quantities , such as distance , explosion time , mass cut , photometry , and ( c ) there may be a degree of degeneracy among explosion energy , initial radius and initial mass within each model . therefore the present comparison does not help to provide a clear assessment of the validity of our physical assumptions and of the predictive power of our model .",
    "the mass of the progenitors of sne  ii - p can be derived from hydrodynamical modeling of light curves and expansion velocities , or from the detection of the pre - supernova object in archival images of the host galaxy in connection with stellar evolution models . at the moment",
    "three progenitor stars of sne  ii - p have been firmly detected and there have been negative detections for 17 other objects which have led to upper limits of the progenitor star masses @xcite . among these , only three sne  ii - p have masses derived using hydrodynamical models : sn  1999em , sn  2004et , and sn  2005cs . in all of these cases the masses estimated from the hydrodynamical modeling are systematically higher than the values derived from the other method .",
    "these discrepancies have been noted previously in the literature . for the particular case of sn  1999em ,",
    "the pre - supernova images give an upper limit of 15 @xmath6 for the progenitor star in the zams .",
    "it is expected that the mass of the pre - supernova object should be lower than this due to possible mass loss episodes during the evolution of the star . in this section",
    "we use our hydrodynamical model to explore a low mass range , consistent with pre - supernova imaging of sn  1999em , in order to test how well we can reproduce the observed properties of this object . although the adoption of non - evolutionary initial models may introduce an uncertainty in the actual progenitor mass ( see   [ sec : initialmodel ] ) , it is interesting to study low- and high - mass models for this sn in a comparative way .",
    "we calculate several models using two different values of the pre - supernova mass : @xmath154 ( see figures  [ fig : m12ver ] and [ fig : m12vni ] ) , and @xmath155 ( see figures  [ fig : m14vp1 ] and [ fig : m14vp2 ] ) . in all figures ,",
    "we show the bolometric light curves and photospheric velocities ( @xmath156 ) for different values of the injected energy ( @xmath13 ) , initial radius ( @xmath14 ) , and degree of @xmath4ni mixing .",
    "table  [ tbl-3 ] gives a summary of the parameters used .",
    "we remark that in all of these models , we have assumed the same value for the @xmath4ni mass as that of model m19r8e1.25ni56 , i.e. @xmath157 , because this value is required to fit the tail of the lc .",
    "also note that the degree of @xmath4ni mixing is taken as a fraction of the initial mass of the object in order to compare the different degrees of mixing in a consistent way when models with different initial mass are used .",
    "for example , a model with a mixing of @xmath4ni up to @xmath158 has an equivalent degree of @xmath4ni mixing as that of model m19r8e1.25ni56 .",
    "for the case of 12 @xmath6 , we have calculated nine models .",
    "we first analyze the effect on the results of the variation of one parameter while keeping the other parameters fixed . in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : m12ver ]",
    "we show the effect on the lc and @xmath156 of the variation of @xmath13 for a model with @xmath159 and @xmath4ni mixing up to @xmath160 . in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : m12ver ] ,",
    "we show the effect of varing @xmath14 , for a model with @xmath161 foe and for the same @xmath4ni mixing .",
    "the sensitivity of the lc and @xmath156 on the extent of @xmath4ni mixing is shown in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : m12vni ] for a model with @xmath161 foe and @xmath159 .",
    "an examination of these figures yields the following conclusions : 1 ) higher injected energy produces higher luminosity and a shorter plateau , 2 ) larger initial radius produces higher luminosity and a longer plateau , 3 ) more extended @xmath4ni mixing produces higher luminosity and a shorter plateau , 4 ) @xmath4ni mixing and initial radius have a small effect on the @xmath156 evolution as compared with that of the explosion energy , and 5 ) as expected , there is no effect of any of these parameters on the tail luminosity .",
    "note that the sensitivity of the lc on @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath4ni mixing is in qualitative concordance with analytic studies by @xcite , @xcite , and previous numerical studies by and more recently by @xcite and .",
    "although we have considered several values of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath4ni mixing , neither of the models with @xmath162 gives a good representation of the observations of sn  1999em .",
    "note that we have calculated also two other models , m12r15e05ni56 and m12r15e08ni56 , adopting even higher values of the initial radius .",
    "these models are shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : m12vni ] . despite the good representation of the lc provided by model m12r15e05ni56",
    ", it fails to reproduce the observed photospheric velocities .",
    "we conclude that it is not possible to reproduce the observations of sn  1999em using models with a pre - supernova mass of @xmath163 .",
    "clearly , masses lower than this value would also fail to match the observations .    for the case of 14 @xmath6",
    ", we have calculated ten models for different combinations of @xmath14 , @xmath13 and @xmath4ni mixing . specifically , we used three different values of the initial radius : @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and @xmath166 , four values of explosion energy : @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , and @xmath170 foe , and three different degrees of @xmath4ni mixing : @xmath171 , @xmath172 , and @xmath160 ( see table  [ tbl-3 ] ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : m14vp1 ] and [ fig : m14vp2 ] show the results of these models . at first sight",
    "we find that these models agree better with the observations than the 12 @xmath6 ones",
    ". therefore the case of 14 @xmath6 deserves a more detailed analysis . as described below , we chose the grid of parameters based on the known effects of each physical parameter on the light curves and velocities , and trying to reach the best possible agreement with the observations .",
    "as noted in section  [ sec : hydro ] , in order to assess the validity of models we will focus on how well they reproduce the observed plateau luminosity and length , and the early photospheric velocities , but we will disregard differences in the early lc before the plateau phase where the uncertainties in both models and data are the largest .    our reference model is shown with a solid line in the upper panels of figure  [ fig : m14vp1 ] and has the following parameters : @xmath173 foe , @xmath174 , and @xmath160 of @xmath4ni mixing .",
    "we note that this reference model has the same initial radius and @xmath4ni mixing as model m19r8e1.25ni56  for 19 @xmath6 .",
    "the energy has been reduced in order to compensate the effect on the luminosity of using a lower mass . as shown in figure  [ fig : m14vp1 ] the reference model produces the correct plateau luminosity and photospheric velocities although the plateau duration is too short as compared with the data . with the aim of remedying this situation while keeping the mass fixed we invoked lower energies and larger radii ( dashed and dotted lines ) . while this served to improve the issue of the plateau length ,",
    "the comparison with photospheric velocities at early times became poorer as expected due to the lower energies .",
    "we therefore consider these models to be unlikely . in a further attempt to find a good 14 @xmath6 model",
    ", we decided to vary the mixing of @xmath4ni while keeping the other parameters as in the reference model .",
    "the results are shown in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : m14vp1 ] .",
    "we now note that while a reduction of the @xmath4ni mixing serves to increase the length of the plateau , the shape of the lc and the plateau luminosity drift away from the observations .",
    "thus , we can also discard these models .",
    "based on the above observations we tested other parameter combinations , as shown in figure  [ fig : m14vp2 ] . in the upper panels we show the tests of models with slightly smaller energies and larger radii as compared with the reference model , and two different degrees of @xmath4ni mixing . while the match of the lc for these models is satisfactory , the problem with the early - time velocities reappears , so we discard these models . in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : m14vp2 ] we show further combinations of parameters . here",
    "we obtain an improvement in the lc while not compromising the agreement in the velocities . among these models",
    "the one called m14r10e09ni56 m provides the best match to the lc and velocity data .",
    "we therefore conclude that the 14 @xmath6 scenario for sn  1999em can not be ruled out , although the comparison with the data is not as good as that of the 19 @xmath6 model ( see figure  [ fig : lc ] and [ fig : velo ] ) .",
    "we have developed a one - dimensional , flux - limited lagrangian hydrodynamical code useful for modeling bolometric light curves and the photospheric velocity evolution of sne  ii - p .",
    "the performance of the code was examined by its application to one of the best observed sne  ii - p , sn  1999em , obtaining a very good agreement with the observations with the following physical parameters @xmath0 foe , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 . in our analysis , we found that an extended mixing of @xmath4ni is needed in order to reproduce a plateau as flat as that shown by the observations of sn  1999em .",
    "we note that the plateau phase , at least in the case of this sn , is powered by the energy deposited by the shock wave and released by the recombination process , plus some extra energy deposited by the radioactive material .    our model for sn  1999em required extensive mixing of @xmath4ni into the envelope .",
    "this has also been strongly suggested by the modeling of the observations of sn  1987a .",
    "in addition , @xcite have also invoked extensive @xmath4ni mixing to model sn  1999em .",
    "@xcite explored the effect on the lcs of sne  ii of the variation of several parameters and found , in concordance with our study , that between 50 and 120 days , the lc is powered by the energy deposited by the shock wave in combination with energy deposited by gamma rays when an extended mixing of @xmath4ni is used .",
    "we compare our results for sn  1999em with two hydrodinamical studies of this object previously given by bbp05 and u07 .",
    "although there are differences in the physical parameters used in each work we believe that the results are remarkably consistent considering the differences in distance , explosion time , mass cut , the observational data employed , and the very different prescriptions for the radiative transfer .",
    "note that the physical parameters used in our calculations are intermediate between those estimated by bbp05 and u07 .",
    "although it is satisfactory that our code provides good fits to the observations with physical parameters similar to those obtained from more sophisticated calculations , we note that given the differences among the three approaches , the comparison does not help to assess the validity of our assumptions nor the predictive power of the methods .",
    "we have also explored the feasibility of fitting the observations of sn  1999em with low mass models , consistent with the upper limits obtained through pre - supernova imaging in connection with stellar evolution models .",
    "we were not able to find a set of physical parameters that reproduce well the observations when assuming pre - supernova masses of @xmath5 12 @xmath6 .",
    "on the other hand , models with 14 @xmath6 can not be fully discarded .",
    "specifically , we found one model with the following parameters : @xmath178 foe , @xmath179 , and @xmath160 of @xmath4ni mixing which provides a reasonable fit to the observations , although not as good as our favorite model of 19 @xmath6 .",
    "we remark that even if the exact values of the progenitor mass may be affected by the choice of parametric initial models , this comparative analysis favors models with total masses larger than 14 @xmath93 .",
    "the fact that models with different masses agree reasonably well with the observations tells us that there is a degree of degeneracy among the physical parameters which must be quantified if one wants to assess the precision to which such parameters can be determined using hydrodynamical calculations .",
    "we plan to continue investigating this issue with our code .    additional information such as modeling of spectra can help discriminating among possible scenarios . on the other hand ,",
    "one way to reduce the number of free parameters would be to use initial models from stellar evolution calculations .",
    "however , the use of evolutionary initial models introduces unobserved features in the resulting light curves probably caused by sharp boundaries between layers with different chemical compositions and/or the steep density jump between the helium core and the hydrogen envelope . with our parametric density and chemical profiles we were able to smooth the transitions and thereby obtain smooth lc",
    "the disadvantage of this approach is that parametric initial models are less directly connected with actual properties of the progenitor star .",
    "as has been previously proposed , we suggest that a possible reason for the need of invoking ad - hoc initial models is the fact that the calculations of the shock propagation are done in one dimension .",
    "therefore , known effects that cause mixing , such as rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instabilities , can not be taken into account .",
    "note that even if rt instabilities produce mixing behind the shock , the effect that is observed in our modeled light curves is related to the structure that is _ left behind _ the passage of the shock once it has reached the surface .",
    "such structure is revealed as the recombination front recedes into the ejecta .",
    "therefore , we think that it is important to attempt to quantify the effect of the rt instability on the mixing and density structure in one dimension in order to check if this effect can explain the type of initial distributions and mixing assumed in our calculations .",
    "the remarkably good agreement with the observation of sn  1999em and the consistency found with previous hydrodynamical studies of this sn using more sophisticated codes gives us confidence in our attempt to model sne  ii - p , at least during the plateau phase and early evolution of the radioactive tail phase , despite the simplifications assumed in our calculation .",
    "this work is the starting point for the analysis of the physical parameters of our sample of 33 sne",
    "ii - p that will be done in a forthcoming paper with the aim of improving our understanding of these objects .",
