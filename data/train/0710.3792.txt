    "the brw is a process which serves as a ( rough ) model for a population living in a spatially structured environment ( the vertices of a  possibly oriented ",
    "graph @xmath1 ) , where each individual lives in a vertex , breeds and dies at random times and each offspring is placed ( randomly ) in one of the neighbouring vertices . there is no bound on the number of individuals allowed per site .",
    "the vertices may be thought as small ecosystems or squares of soil ( with their proximity connections  the edges ) and individuals as animals or plants .",
    "depending on the parameters involved and on the nature of @xmath1 , the population may face almost sure extinction , global survival ( i.e.  with positive probability at any time there will be at least one individual alive ) or local survival ( i.e.  with positive probability at arbitrarily large times there will be at least one individual alive in a fixed vertex ) .",
    "these matters have been investigated by several authors ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite only to mention a few , see @xcite for more references ) .",
    "let us be more precise as to the definition of the process and of the environment .",
    "the graph @xmath1 is endowed with a weight function @xmath2 such that @xmath3 if and only if @xmath4 ( in which case we write @xmath5 ) .",
    "we call the couple @xmath6 a weighted graph .",
    "we require that there exists @xmath7 such that @xmath8 for all @xmath9 ( other conditions will be stated in section  [ sec : definitions ] ) .    given @xmath10 , the branching random walk ( brw@xmath11 or briefly brw ) is the continuous - time markov process @xmath12 , with configuration space @xmath13 , where each existing particle at @xmath14 has an exponential lifespan of parameter 1 and , during its life , breeds at the arrival times of a poisson process of parameter @xmath15 and then chooses to send its offspring to @xmath16 with probability @xmath17 ( note that @xmath18 is the transition matrix of a random walk on @xmath19 ) . in the literature",
    "one usually finds the particular case @xmath20 for all @xmath9 ( i.e.  the breeding rate is constant among locations  no place is more fertile than others ) or , sometimes , the case where @xmath21 ( i.e.  the breeding rate is proportional to the degree and all edges have the same rate ) .",
    "two critical parameters are associated to the brw : the weak ( or global ) survival critical parameter @xmath22 and the strong ( or local ) survival one @xmath23 .",
    "they are defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a fixed vertex , @xmath26 is the configuration with no particles at all sites and @xmath27 is the law of the process which starts with one individual in @xmath25 .",
    "note that these values do not depend on the initial configuration , provided that this configuration is finite ( that is , it has only a finite number of individuals ) , nor on the choice of @xmath25 . see section [ sec : definitions ] for a discussion on the values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    when @xmath6 is infinite ( and connected ) , the brw is , so to speak , unbounded in two respects : the environment , since individuals may live at arbitrarily large distance from their ancestors ( actually @xmath28-th generation individuals may live at distance @xmath28 from the ancestor ) , and the colonies size , since an arbitrarily large number of individuals may pile up on any vertex . hence it is natural to consider `` truncated '' brws where either space or colonies are bounded , and investigate the relationship between these processes and the brw .",
    "indeed , in the literature one often finds problems tackled first in finite or compact spaces and then reached through a `` thermodynamical limit '' procedure .",
    "one can see easily that it is possible to construct the brw either from the process on finite sets ( spatial truncation ) or from the process on infinite space and a bound on the number of particles per site ( particles truncation ) . in both cases the truncated process , for any fixed time @xmath29 , converges almost surely to the brw .",
    "first we consider `` spatially truncated '' brws .",
    "we choose a family of weighted subgraphs @xmath30 , such that @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 for all @xmath34 .",
    "the process brw@xmath35 can be seen as the brw@xmath11 with the constraint that reproductions outside @xmath36 are deleted and the ones from @xmath14 to @xmath16 ( @xmath34 in @xmath36 ) are removed with probability @xmath37 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that for any fixed @xmath29 , as @xmath28 goes to infinity , the brw@xmath35 converges to the brw almost surely .",
    "our first result is that @xmath38 ( the latter being the strong survival critical parameter of the brw on @xmath6 ) .",
    "indeed we prove a slightly more general result ( theorem  [ th : sen2 ] ) which allows us to show that if @xmath39 and @xmath36 is the infinite cluster of the bernoulli bond percolation of parameter @xmath40 , where @xmath41 sufficiently fast , then @xmath38 almost surely with respect to the percolation probability space ( section  [ sec : perc ] ) .",
    "second we consider brws where at most @xmath0 individuals per site are allowed ( thus taking values in @xmath42 ) .",
    "we call this process brw@xmath43 and denote it by @xmath44 . note that if @xmath45 we get the contact process ( indeed the brw@xmath43 is sometimes referred to as a `` multitype contact process ''  see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "it is easily seen that for all fixed @xmath29 we have @xmath46 almost surely ( see for instance @xcite where the authors suggest this limit as a way to contruct the brw ) .",
    "clearly , for all @xmath47 , one may consider the critical parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 defined as in with @xmath50 in place of @xmath51 .",
    "one of the main questions we investigate in this paper is whether @xmath52 and @xmath53 : to our knowledge this was still unknown even for the case where @xmath54 with @xmath55 transition matrix of the simple random walk .",
    "here is a brief outline of the paper . in section [ sec : definitions ] we state the basic terminology and assumptions needed in the sequel .",
    "section [ sec : spatial ] is devoted to the spatial approximation of the strong critical parameter @xmath23 by finite or infinite sets ( see theorems  [ th : sen ] and [ th : sen2 ] respectively ) .",
    "we note that results on the spatial approximation , in the special case when @xmath39 and @xmath55 is the transition matrix of the simple random walk , were obtained in @xcite using a different approach . in section  [ sec : roadmap ] we introduce the technique we use to prove convergence of the critical parameters of the brw@xmath43 .",
    "the technique is essentially a suitable coupling with a supercritical bond percolation : this kind of comparison has been widely used in the literature , see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the coupling here is quite tricky , therefore we describe it in four steps which can be adapted to different graphs . in section  [ sec : truncateds ] we prove that @xmath56 converges to @xmath23 under some assumptions of self - similarity of the graph ( theorem  [ th : main ] ) . as a corollary",
    ", we have @xmath53 for @xmath57 with the simple random walk .",
    "the same approach is used in section  [ sec : truncatedw ] to prove the convergence of the sequence @xmath58 to @xmath22 when @xmath39 ( see theorem  [ th : zdrift ] and corollary  [ cor : zd ] , and remark  [ rem : cartprod ] for a slightly more general class of graphs ) or when @xmath19 is a homogeneous tree ( theorem  [ th : tree ] ) .",
    "the results of section  [ sec : spatial ] are applied in section  [ sec : perc ] in order to study the strong critical parameter of a brw restricted to a random subgraph generated by a bernoulli bond percolation process .",
    "section  [ sec : open ] is devoted to final remarks and open questions .",
    "in this section we state our assumptions on the graph @xmath6 ; we also recall the description of the brw through its generator and the associated semigroup , and discuss the values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    given the ( weighted ) graph @xmath6 , the degree of a vertex @xmath14 , @xmath59 is the cardinality of the set @xmath60 ; we require that @xmath6 is with bounded geometry , that is @xmath61 .",
    "moreover we consider @xmath6 connected , which by our definition of @xmath55 ( recall that @xmath3 if and only if @xmath4 ) is equivalent to @xmath62 for some @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the @xmath28-th power of the matrix @xmath55 . when @xmath65 is stochastic ( i.e.  @xmath20 for all @xmath9 ) , in order to stress this property we use the notation @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 instead of @xmath55 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",

    "we need to define the product of two graphs ( in our paper these will be space / time products ) : given two graphs @xmath1 , @xmath72 we denote by @xmath73 the weighted graph with set of vertices @xmath74 and set of edges @xmath75 ( in figure [ fig : xtimesy ] we draw the connected component of @xmath76 containing @xmath77 ) . besides , by @xmath78 we mean the graph with the same vertex set as before and vertices @xmath79 ( see figure [ fig : xsquarey ] ) .",
