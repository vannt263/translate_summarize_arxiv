    "the existence of neutrino masses and mixing angles is experimentally well confirmed and therefore the theoretical understanding and description of those quantities is one of the most urgent issues for particle physics  @xcite .",
    "there are two frequently studied theoretical extensions of the standard model of particle physics which also were expected to explain the origin and the shape of the small but non zero neutrino mass matrix . on the one hand there is supersymmetry .",
    "although there is no experimental evidence for supersymmetry , it is often invoked that the unification of gauge coupling constants at the gut scale is an indirect indication for supersymmetry .",
    "it has been pointed out that this gauge unification is achieved even if all scalar superpartners of quarks and leptons are very heavy , introducing the scenario called split supersymmetry ( ss )  @xcite .",
    "the original ss scenario includes r - parity conservation , which guarantees the stability of the lsp and thus a dark matter candidate , and only one light higgs doublet , which behaves like the sm higgs . despite the fact that models with r - parity violation ( rpv ) loose the lsp as a dark matter candidate , they are studied because they provide a compelling mechanism for the generation of neutrino masses  @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , ss models with rpv are incapable to produce the necessary neutrino masses , even in next to leading order calculations @xcite .",
    "on the other hand there is the possible existence of non - renormalizable gravitational interactions .",
    "those interactions could have an influence on the neutrino sector of the standard model  @xcite .",
    "although the standard planck scale @xmath2  gev generates a solar mass which is too small to fit the experimental evidence , a lowered planck scale @xmath3 might in principle do the job . however , gravitational interactions are expected to be `` flavor blind '' and it has been shown that therefore a purely gravitational neutrino sector is also incapable to explain the existence of three different neutrino masses  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the combined effect of the supersymmetrical and gravitational neutrino sector .",
    "we find that the combination of both effects can explain all present neutrino data . but",
    "this kind of model even leads to predictions for the solar neutrino mixing angle @xmath4 and for the scale of the gravitational contribution .",
    "in split susy all scalars are very heavy , except for one higgs doublet  @xcite . since we are interested in the possibility to describe the neutrino masses in split - susy , we need to consider r - parity violating interactions  @xcite . knowing all relevant trilinear r - parity violating interactions one can calculate the neutralino / neutrino mass matrix . integrating out the neutralinos from this matrix",
    ", one finds that the neutrino mass matrix in flavor space is given by @xcite : @xmath5\\quad , \\label{treenumass}\\ ] ] where the determinant of the neutralino mass matrix is : @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the vacuum expectation value of the light higgs field , @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the gaugino masses .",
    "further , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the trilinear couplings between the higgs boson , the gauginos , and the higgsinos .",
    "the parameters @xmath12 @xcite are related to the traditional brpv parameters @xmath13 @xcite by @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath15 are the parameters that mix higgsinos with leptons , and @xmath16 are dimensionless parameters that mix gauginos with leptons . finally , @xmath17 is the higgsino mass .",
    "this effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath18 has only one eigenvalue different from zero . as in the case of r - parity violation in the mssm with bilinear terms ,",
    "only one neutrino is massive .",
    "as it is explained in the literature  @xcite , in ss it is not possible to explain the neutrino masses and mixing using bilinear terms only .",
    "further allowing for trilinear couplings makes it in principle possible to obtain solar neutrino masses and mixing .",
    "however this possibility was not discussed here , because it only works for a very special choice of parameters with an undesired hierarchical structure among the trilinear couplings  @xcite . without this hierarchical structure ,",
    "the trilinear couplings become irrelevant because they contribute through loops of sparticles that have a mass of the order of the split supersymmetric scale @xmath19 , and therefore , decoupled .",
    "it is widely assumed that the unknown quantum gravity lagrangian can be expanded to low energies . in flavor space",
    "this expansion can give rise to a non - renormalizable term in the lagrangian of the type @xmath20 here , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the lepton and higgs fields respectively . in an idealized model the flavor mixing coefficients @xmath23 can all be taken to be of order one  @xcite .",
    "when the higgs acquires a vacuum expectation value , a neutrino mass is generated @xmath24 with @xmath7 the electroweak vacuum expectation value .",
    "this type of contribution to the neutrino mass matrix has also been explored in @xcite .",
    "since this neutrino mass term is too small , we look into the possibility that the true planck scale @xmath3 is actually much lower than @xmath25 .",
    "such a lowered planck scale @xmath3 is an intrinsic prediction of models with compact extra dimensions . in some of those models the experimentally allowed planck scale @xmath3 can be as low as one tev @xcite .",
    "however , a tev gravity scale in operators like in eq .",
    "( [ qgoperator ] ) meets strong constraints from precision measurements such as @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "this can be met by imposing additional symmetries or by admitting that @xmath3 might not be so extremely small @xmath27 several papers  @xcite discuss contributions of an exact `` blindness '' model , where the part of the neutrino mass matrix coming from gravitational effects can be parameterized in flavor space as @xmath28\\quad,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 it should be to noticed that such an exact `` blindness '' model does not imply base independence in flavor space .",
    "this means that only when written in the flavor base ( defined by a diagonal mass matrix of the charged leptons ) , the matrix ( [ mumatrix ] ) takes its symmetric form .",
    "further , such a model can only give direct predictions for the upmns matrix ( [ upmns2 ] ) if the relation of flavor basis to the mass basis is defined for the charged leptons as well .",
    "like in the standard model this relation is implicitly assumed for the above contribution by taking both basis to coincide  @xcite .    in order to explain the solar mass scale the fundamental scale has to be @xmath30 , which is in good agreement with the inequality in eq .",
    "( [ inequality ] ) .",
    "however , the matrix in eq .",
    "( [ mumatrix ] ) has only one eigenvalue different from zero .",
    "therefore such a scenario can not account for both solar and atmospheric neutrino mass splittings .",
    "now we will discuss the possibility that both , r - parity violating split susy and low scale quantum gravity operators like eq .",
    "( [ qgoperator ] ) contribute to the lagrangian . in this case",
    ", two terms can contribute to the neutrino mass matrix . since the mass terms in eqs .",
    "( [ treenumass ] ) and ( [ mumatrix ] ) are both formulated in flavor space one can write the total effective neutrino mass matrix as , @xmath31 where we defined the factor in front of the mass matrix in equation ( [ treenumass ] ) as @xmath32 . as defined above , the neutrino mass matrix does not contain cp violating phases . in this case , if @xmath33 and @xmath34 the three neutrino masses are @xmath35 where we have defined the auxiliary vector @xmath36 . in the approximation where the @xmath37 term is subdominant , the squared mass differences are given by , @xmath38 this shows that for a very small @xmath37 , the atmospheric mass scale is controlled by the parameter @xmath32 and the solar mass scale is controlled by @xmath37 . in this approximation ,",
    "the eigenvectors are equal to , @xmath39 and the matrix @xmath40 is formed with the eigenvectors in its columns . the neutrino mixing matrix",
    "is defined as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a rotation matrix around the axis one ( with cyclic permutations for the other two ) .    at this point",
    "it is instructive to have a closer look at the matrix @xmath40 .",
    "this matrix appears in the lagrangian of the leptonic charged current interactions such that , @xmath43 where fermions are in the mass eigenstate basis . in the most general situation , both the charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices are non - diagonal in the interaction basis , @xmath44 where the prime on the fermion fields denote the interaction basis .",
    "the two mass matrices are diagonalized by @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath47 and the @xmath40 matrix becomes , @xmath48 where we have assumed cp conservation .",
    "due to the majorana nature of neutrinos , @xmath40 depends on three mixing angles and three majorana phases .",
    "we assume the latter to be zero . in general",
    ", a simultaneous diagonalization of @xmath49 and @xmath50 is necessary to find @xmath40 . in principle",
    "there might be also off - diagonal contributions to the matrix @xmath50 coming from the `` flavor blind '' gravitational terms in eq .",
    "( [ qgoperator ] ) ( r - parity violating supersymmetric intercations do not modify @xmath45 ) .",
    "however , those contributions ( if they are present ) can be depreciated in our model since they only can produce corrections to the diagonal mass matrix of the charged leptons of the order @xmath51 .",
    "this makes @xmath45 equal to unity up to terms of the order of @xmath52 . in order to have a predictive model we do not consider any other beyond the standard model contributions , like non - diagonal terms in the yukawa couplings of the charged leptons",
    "therefore , one can identify @xmath40 with @xmath46 .",
    "it is in this basis that we include the `` flavor blind '' contribution from gravity given in eq .",
    "( [ mumatrix ] ) .",
    "in this section we present some numerical results , where we find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the @xmath53 effective neutrino mass matrix using numerical methods . with them , we find neutrino mass differences and mixing angles , and compare them with values from experimental measurements .",
    "the solar and atmospheric mass differences , as well as the solar and atmospheric mixing angles , have been measured in several experiments .",
    ".experimental measurements for neutrino parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the neutrino mass differences @xmath54 and @xmath55 are shown in fig .",
    "[ masses_mug ] .",
    "the left frame shows that a growing @xmath37 gives a growing @xmath54 , which can be understood by comparing to the approximation in eq .",
    "( [ eq_msolapprox ] ) , that is , the @xmath32 term dominates over the @xmath37 term in eq .",
    "( [ eq_mixmod ] ) . in the right frame",
    "we have the atmospheric mass difference @xmath55 as a function of the gravitational neutrino mass parameter @xmath37 , where there is no obvious dependence because the atmospheric mass difference is dominated by the @xmath32 term . in both mass differences",
    "though , we see that the predictions lie nicely at the center of the experimental window .",
    "it is also instructive to study how the scale of the supersymmetric term @xmath32 and the scale of the gravitational term @xmath37 are pinned down by the individual experimental constraints in table i. starting from the benchmark point in eq .",
    "( [ benchmark ] ) and varying with respect to @xmath32 and @xmath37 we plot the allowed regions for every observable and the intersection of those regions .",
    "-@xmath37 plane .",
    "[ exclusionplot],width=264 ]    at the center of fig .",
    "[ exclusionplot ] we have the zone in the @xmath32-@xmath37 plane which is consistent with experiments , and formed by the intersection of several regions .",
    "region i is a vertical stripe where mainly the @xmath32 parameter is constrained by the @xmath56 data .",
    "region ii is a horizontal stripe where @xmath37 is constrained by the @xmath57 data .",
    "note that this horizontal stripe turns into a vertical one after an eigenvalue crossing , although this last branch is not allowed by the solar angle data .",
    "finally , region iii indicates the constraint from @xmath58 , whose allowed region is at the right of the diagonal line , which breaks at the top also due to an eigenvalue crossing .",
    "constraints from the other neutrino observables are not relevant for this figure .",
    "the main features from fig .  [ exclusionplot ] can be understood by looking at the approximations in eqs .",
    "( [ eq_msolapprox ] ) and ( [ eq_matmapprox ] ) , which show that for small values of @xmath37 , the atmospheric mass difference @xmath56 is dominated by @xmath32 , while the solar mass difference @xmath57 is dominated by @xmath37 .",
    "one sees that in the vicinity of this benchmark point , the other observables play a minor role in pinning down the scale parameters @xmath32 and @xmath37 .",
    "it is known that in split supersymmetry with r - parity violation an atmospheric mass difference is generated at tree level , but one - loop contributions are not enough to lift the symmetry of the effective neutrino mass matrix , thus not being able to generate a solar mass difference .",
    "this problem is not solved by adding the , in principle always present , `` flavor blind '' couplings from dimension five operators .",
    "the reason is that the planck scale is too large to generate a solar mass difference large enough to be compatible with experiments . in this article",
    "we have shown that split supersymmetry with r - parity violation , plus `` flavor blind '' gravity effects with a reduced planck scale , present in models with compact extra dimensions , can be compatible with all data form neutrino experiments .",
    "the atmospheric mass difference is generated by supersymmetry with a mixing between neutrinos and neutralinos , while the solar mass difference is generated by the `` flavor blind '' gravitational effects .",
    "this model predicts a value for the gravitational term @xmath59 ev , which corresponds to a reduced planck scale @xmath60 gev .",
    "the fact that this reduced planck scale is equal to gut scale is a tantalizing result that may be related to gauge coupling unification of all four forces .",
    "in addition , the solar mixing angle is predicted to satisfy @xmath61 .",
    "we show also that a maximal atmospheric mixing @xmath62 implies @xmath63 , which agrees with the implications from our parameter scan @xmath64 , when we adopt the central value @xmath65 . in this way",
    ", the model not only reproduce the experimental results but it is also predictive and , therefore , can be falsified by future experiments .",
