    "the antares  neutrino telescope is situated in the mediterranean sea at a depth of about 2500  m , approximately 40  km south east of the french town of toulon .",
    "neutrinos are detected through the detection of cherenkov light produced by the charged lepton that emerges from a neutrino interaction in the vicinity of the detector .",
    "measurements are focused mainly on muon - neutrinos , since the muon resulting from a neutrino interaction can travel a distance of up to several kilometres . due to the transparency of the sea water ( the absorption length is about 50  m ) , the faint cherenkov light can be detected at relatively large distances from the muon track .",
    "a large volume of sea water is turned into a neutrino detector by deploying a 3-dimensional array of light sensors in the water .",
    "the antares  detector consists of thirteen lines , each with up to 25  storeys .",
    "the storeys are connected by cables which provide mechanical strength , electrical contact and fibre - optic readout .",
    "each line is held on the seabed by a dead - weight anchor and kept vertical by a buoy at the top of its 450  m length . along",
    "eleven lines , 25  storeys with three light sensors are placed at an inter - storey distance of 14.5  m starting 100  m above the seabed . on each storey",
    "three spherical glass pressure vessels contain 10  hamamatsu photo - multiplier tubes ( pmts ) , which are oriented with their axes pointing downward at an angle of 45  degrees from the vertical .",
    "one line consists of 20  such storeys , and one line is equipped with deep - sea instrumentation .",
    "each storey in the detector has a titanium cylinder which houses the electronics for data acquisition and slow control .",
    "this system is referred to as the local control module . in addition",
    ", each line has a line control module that is located at the anchor .",
    "daylight does not penetrate to the depth of the antares  site .",
    "therefore the telescope can be operated day and night .",
    "but even in the absence of daylight , a ubiquitous background luminosity is present in the deep - sea due to the decay of radioactive isotopes ( mainly @xmath0k ) and to bioluminescence .",
    "this background luminosity produces a relatively high count rate of random signals in the detector ( 60150  khz per pmt ) .",
    "this background can be suppressed by applying the characteristic time - position correlations that correspond to a passing muon to the data .",
    "the main purpose of the data acquisition ( daq ) system is to convert the analogue pulses from the pmts into a readable input for the off - line reconstruction software .",
    "the daq system is based on the  all - data - to - shore \" concept  @xcite . in this , all signals from the pmts that pass a preset threshold ( typically 0.3 photo - electrons ) are digitised and all digital data are sent to shore where they are processed in real - time by a farm of commodity pcs .",
    "the network architecture of the off - shore daq system has a star topology . in this",
    ", the storeys in a line are organised into separate sectors , each consisting of 5  storeys , and the detector lines are connected to a main junction box .",
    "the junction box is connected to a station on shore via a single electro - optical cable .",
    "the network consists of a pair of optical fibres for each detector line , an 8  channel dense wavelength division ( dwdm ) in each line control module ( 200  ghz spacing ) , a small ethernet switch in each sector and a processor in each local control module .",
    "the ethernet switch in the sector consists of a combination of the allayer al121 ( eight 100  mb / s ports ) and the allayer al1022 ( two gb / s ports ) .",
    "one of the 100  mb / s ports is connected to the processor in the local control module via its backplane ( 100base  cx ) and four are connected to the other local control modules in the same sector via a bi - directional optical fibre ( 100base  sx ) .",
    "one of the two gb / s ports is connected to a dwdm transceiver ( 1000base  cx ) .",
    "the dwdm transceiver is then 11 connected to an identical transceiver on shore using two uni - directional optical fibres ( 1000base  lh ) .",
    "the line control module has also a processor which is connected to a dwdm transceiver via its backplane ( 100base  cx ) . a similar pair of dwdm transceivers is then used to establish a 100  mb / s link to shore ( 100base  lh ) . the network architecture on - shore consists of an optical and 6  dwdm transceivers for each detector line , a large ethernet switch ( 192  ports ) , a data processing farm and a data storage facility .",
    "the optical fibres and the ethernet switches form together a ( large ) local area network . hence",
    ", it is possible to route the data from any local control module in the detector to any pc on shore .",
    "the front - end electronics consist of custom built analogue ring sampler ( ars ) chips which digitise the charge and the time of the analogue signals from the pmt .",
    "the combined data is generally referred to as a hit ; it can be a single photo - electron hit or a complete waveform . the arrival time is determined from the signal of the clock system in the local control module .",
    "an on - shore clock system ( master ) drives the clock systems in the local control modules ( slaves ) .",
    "the processor in the local control module is a motorola mpc860p .",
    "it runs the vxworks real time operating system  @xcite and hosts the daqharness and scharness processes .",
    "the daqharness and scharness are used to handle respectively the data from the ars chips and the data from the various deep - sea instruments .",
    "the latter is usually referred to as slow control data .",
    "the processor in the local control module has a fast ethernet controller ( 100  mb / s ) that is connected to the ethernet switch in the sector . inside the local control module ,",
    "two serial ports with either rs485 or rs232 links and the modbus protocol are used to handle the slow control signals .",
    "the specific hardware for the readout of the ars chips is implemented in a high density field programmable gate array ( xilinx virtex - e xcv1000e ) .",
    "the data are temporarily stored in a high capacity memory ( 64  mb sdram ) allowing a de - randomisation of the data flow . in this , the data are stored as an array of hits . the length of these arrays is determined by a predefined time frame of about 100  ms and the singles rates of the pmts .",
    "it amounts to about 60200  kb .",
    "the data are read out from this memory by the daqharness process and sent to shore .",
    "all data corresponding to the same time frame are sent to a single data filter process in the on - shore data processing system .",
    "the on - shore data processing system consists of about 50 pcs running the linux operating system . to make optimal use of the multi - core technology , four data filter processes run on each pc .",
    "the physics events are filtered from the data by the data filter process using a fast algorithm .",
    "the typical time needed to process 100  ms of raw data amounts to 500  ms .",
    "the available time is used to apply designated software triggers to the same data .",
    "for example , a trigger that tracks the galactic centre  is used whenever the count rates of the pmts are below 150  khz ( this corresponds to about 80% of the time ) . on average ,",
    "the data flow is reduced by a factor of about 10,000 .",
    "the filtered data are written to disk in root format  @xcite by a central data writing process .",
    "the count rate information of every pmt is stored together with the physics data .",
    "the sampling frequency of these rate measurements is about 10  hz . the data from the readout of the various instruments are transferred as an array of parameter values and stored in the database via a single process .",
    "the readout of the various deep - sea instruments is scheduled via read requests that are sent from shore by a designated process .",
    "the frequency of these read requests is defined in the database .",
    "a general purpose data server based on the tagged data concept is used to route messages and data  @xcite .",
    "for instance , there is one such server to route the physics events to the data writer which is also used for online monitoring .",
    "messages ( warnings , errors , etc . ) are collected , displayed and written to disk by a designated gui .",
    "the main control gui allows the operator to modify the state of the system . in total",
    ", the system involves about 750  processes ( 300  daqharness processes , 300  scharness processes , 120  data filters , and various other processes ) .",
    "these processes implement the same state machine diagram  @xcite . before the start of a data taking run , the whole system including the detector is configured . in order to archive data efficiently , the main control gui updates the run number regularly .",
    "the database system is used to keep track of the history of the detector and the data taking .",
    "it is also used for storing and retrieving configuration parameters of the whole system .",
    "the positions of the pmts are determined using a system of acoustic transmitters and receivers .",
    "the corresponding data are recorded at the same time as the physics data .",
    "the time calibration of the pmts is obtained using special data taking runs . during these runs , one or more led beacons ( or laser beacon ) flash .",
    "the typical flash rate is about 1  khz .",
    "the time calibration data are recorded using a designated software trigger .",
    "all data are archived in the in2p3 computer centre in lyon which also houses the oracle database system .",
    "the on - shore data processing system is linked to the gamma - ray bursts coordinates network ( gcn )  @xcite .",
    "this network includes the swift and fermi satellites .",
    "there are about 12 gcn alerts per day and half of them correspond to a real gamma - ray burst . for each alert ,",
    "all raw data are saved to disk during a preset period ( presently 2 minutes ) .",
    "the buffering of the data in the data filter processors is used to save the data up to about one minute before the actual alert  @xcite .",
    "the performance of the daq system can be summarised in terms of the efficiency to detect neutrinos and the efficiency to operate the neutrino telescope .",
    "the efficiency to detect neutrinos is primarily determined by the capability to filter the physics events from the continuous data streams . with the all - data - to - shore system",
    ", different software triggers can be operated simultaneously . at present ,",
    "two general purpose muon triggers ( ` standard ' ) and one minimum bias trigger are used to take data .",
    "the minimum bias trigger is used for monitoring the data quality .",
    "the standard trigger makes use of the general causality relation :      where @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) refers to the time ( position ) of hit @xmath4 , @xmath5 the speed of light and @xmath6 the index of refraction of the sea water . in this",
    ", the direction of the muon , and hence the neutrino , is not used .",
    "the standard trigger is therefore sensitive to muons covering the full sky . to limit the rate of accidental correlations , the hits have been preselected .",
    "this pre - selection ( l1 ) includes coincidences between two neighbouring pmts in the same storey and large pulses ( number of photo - electrons typically greater than 3 ) . the minimum number of detected photons to trigger an event ranges between 45 l1 hits , depending on the trigger algorithm .",
    "this corresponds to a typical threshold of several 100  gev .",
    "the purity of the trigger ( fraction of events that correspond to a genuine muon ) has been determined using a simulation of the detector response to muons traversing the detector and a simulation based on the observed background .",
    "the purity is found to be better than 90% .",
    "the 10% impurity is mainly due to ( low - energy ) muons that in combination with the random background produce a trigger .",
    "a small fraction of the events ( @xmath7 ) is due to accidental correlations .",
    "the observed trigger rate is thus dominated by the background of atmospheric muons and amounts to ( depending on the trigger conditions ) .",
    "in addition to the standard trigger , a trigger that tracks the galactic centre  is used to maximise the detection efficiency of neutrinos coming from the galactic centre .",
    "this trigger makes use of the direction specific causality relation :      where @xmath9 refers to the position of hit @xmath4 along the neutrino direction , @xmath10 refers to distance between the positions of hits @xmath4 and @xmath11 in the plane perpendicular to the neutrino direction and @xmath12 to the characteristic cherenkov angle .",
    "compared to equation [ eq:3d ] , this condition is more stringent because the 2-dimensional distance is always smaller than the 3-dimensional distance .",
    "further more , this distance corresponds to the distance travelled by the photon ( and not by the muon ) .",
    "hence , it can be limited to several absorption lengths ( e.g.  100  m or so ) without loss of detection efficiency .",
    "this restriction reduces the combinatorics significantly ( about a factor of 10 for each additional hit ) . as a consequence ,",
    "all hits can be considered and not only preselected hits ( l1 ) without compromising the purity of the physics events .",
    "the detection efficiency of the general purpose muon trigger and the galactic centre  trigger are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : volume ] .",
    "the effective volume is defined as the volume in which an interaction of a muon neutrino would produce a detectable event .      as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ f : volume ] , the detection efficiency obtained with the galactic centre  trigger is significantly higher than that obtained with the standard trigger . as a result , the sensitivity to neutrinos from the galactic centre  is greatly improved .",
    "the field of view for which this improved efficiency is obtained is about 10  degrees ."
