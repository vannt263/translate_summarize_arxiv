    "let us consider the following simple problem . in the euclidean plane take two rays starting at point @xmath1 and forming an acute angle of measure @xmath2 .",

    "keep constructing further segments with respect to the following rule : to create a new transversal , take the angle between the most recently constructed transversal and the corresponding ray , and let the new transversal be the bisector of this angle .",
    "in particular , if we have as our last transversal @xmath8 , we take the bisector of @xmath9 , denote its intersection with line @xmath4 by @xmath10 and use the transversal @xmath11 for the next step ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "clearly , this process creates not only two sequences of points @xmath12 , @xmath13 but also two sequences of angles @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .        by expressing each sequence of angles as a first order difference equation , it is easy to show that @xmath18    irrespective of the choice of the initial transversal segment .",
    "we show below that this property holds under more general circumstances .",
    "specifically , we replace the plane with a smooth surface in @xmath0 , where our triangles will be geodesic triangles , and drop the condition that the angles are created by bisection .",

    "small \" triangle we will mean one contained in an open subset of @xmath26 , which is a normal neighborhood of all its points .",
    "proof of the existence of such a neighborhood for each point @xmath31 can be found in  4 - 7 of @xcite .",

    "assume now that we are given a  small \" triangle @xmath44 on a regular surface @xmath19 and denote @xmath45 by @xmath2 , and assume that @xmath46 .",

    "then we iterate this procedure to construct two sequences of points @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and angles @xmath76    here arises a natural question . do the sequences @xmath77 and @xmath78 converge , and if so , to what values ?",
    "in the next section we will prove the following    for an arbitrary small triangle @xmath44 on a regular surface @xmath26 in @xmath0 with the angle @xmath79 and two continuous positive functions @xmath80 and @xmath81 , we have @xmath82 and @xmath83       if , in addition to the conditions of the theorem we assume that functions @xmath84 and @xmath85 are equal , then @xmath86       recall that a point @xmath87 is called elliptic when the gauss curvature @xmath88 , hyperbolic when @xmath89 and parabolic when @xmath90 .",
    "our next corollary shows that there exist functions @xmath91 and @xmath92 so that the limits of our sequences of angles will distinguish the type of the point @xmath1 .",

    "straightforward computations show that in the case of a parabolic , elliptic , and hyperbolic points correspondingly , we have @xmath97",
    "the proof of theorem 1 relies on a generalization of the banach contraction mapping principle and a special case of the local version of the gauss - bonnet theorem .",
    "let us first recall the contraction principle .    * the contraction theorem * consider a complete metric space @xmath98 .",
    "let @xmath99 be a contraction mapping with lipschitz constant @xmath100 , and suppose @xmath101 is the fixed point of @xmath102 .",
    "let @xmath103 be a sequence of positive numbers converging to zero , and suppose @xmath104 satisfies : @xmath105 then the sequence @xmath77 converges to @xmath106 .",
    "we refer the reader to chapter 3 of @xcite for a proof of this theorem .",
    "let s apply the gauss - bonnet theorem to geodesic triangles @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "using notations from figure 2 , one will get the following : @xmath109 which is equivalent to the formula @xmath110 and similarly @xmath111 which gives @xmath112 in terms of @xmath106 and @xmath2 : @xmath113      @xmath114 since @xmath115 and @xmath116 for an arbitrary point @xmath117 , the map @xmath118 will be a contraction with lipschitz constant @xmath119 \\in ( 0,1)$ ] .",
    "its fixed point @xmath106 can be found by a straight forward computation @xmath120 to apply the contraction theorem for this map @xmath102 , we set @xmath121 with the standard distance function @xmath122 .",
    "then it follows that +   + @xmath123    thus , to prove our theorem for the sequence @xmath77 , it is enough to show that @xmath124 when @xmath125 . for this",
    "we will show that the difference of two fractions and each of the double integrals in the formula for @xmath126 converge to zero .",
    "the gaussian curvature of a regular surface is a smooth function , and hence it is universally bounded on a small triangle . since the union of all triangles @xmath127 is contained in the small triangle @xmath44 , we must have @xmath128 and hence the general term of the series converges to zero . as for the integrals over the triangles @xmath108 , we first notice that both sequences @xmath129 and @xmath130 converge to the vertex @xmath1 ( see lemma 1 below )",
    ". therefore length of each of three geodesics @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 approaches zero , which implies that the regions in @xmath22 corresponding to the triangles @xmath134 get shrunk to a point .",
    "hence    @xmath135 convergence to zero of @xmath136 follows from the lemma since both functions @xmath137 are continuous .",
    "thus , @xmath138 , when @xmath125 , and hence our result for @xmath139 .",
    "to finish the proof take the limit as @xmath125 of each side in formula ( @xmath140 ) to obtain the desired answer for the sequence @xmath141 .",
    "suppose we are given a geodesic segment @xmath143 .",
    "as above , we will designate here the length of such a segment by @xmath144 . since our triangle @xmath145 is a small one , it is easy to see that the sequence of points @xmath130 converges to a point , @xmath35 , on the geodesic segment @xmath146 .",
    "assume that @xmath147 .",
    "then @xmath148 , sufficiently small , @xmath149 , a large enough natural number , such that @xmath150 , @xmath10 will be in a neighborhood of radius @xmath151 centered at @xmath35 and contained in @xmath152 .",
    "further , we assume that @xmath151 is so small that @xmath152 has no points in common with the segment @xmath153 .",
    "this implies that @xmath154 such that for all large enough @xmath155 we also have @xmath156 .",
    "consider a regular parametrization @xmath157\\lra b_1v$ ] of the geodesic @xmath146 such that @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 let us denote by @xmath161 $ ] , @xmath162 , the parameter value corresponding to the point @xmath163 , i.e. @xmath164 . since the sequence @xmath130 converges and @xmath165 is smooth , the corresponding sequence of parameters @xmath166 will converge as well .",
    "as the next step , we use the exponential map to show that existence of the limit point @xmath35 with @xmath167 implies the convergence to zero of both sequences @xmath139 and @xmath141 . assume that @xmath168 is large enough and recall that @xmath169 is a diffeomorphism locally and its image contains our small triangle @xmath170 .",
    "in particular , we can consider the preimage of the two geodesics segments @xmath171 , and @xmath172 , which will be line segments in @xmath173 .",
    "we denote those lines by @xmath174 and @xmath175 respectively(i.e .",
    "@xmath176 ) . since @xmath177 preserves the angles and lengths of rays through the point @xmath178 , we have that @xmath179 where @xmath180 .",
    "we also have the following inequalities : @xmath181 > c\\cdot{\\rm sin}(p(a_n)\\cdot\\alpha_n),\\ ] ] where @xmath182 denotes the length of the curve @xmath183\\subset t_{a_n}s$ ] and can be computed by the integral @xmath184 is smooth , there exists a positive constant @xmath185 such that for all large enough @xmath168 , we have @xmath186 which implies that the sequence of angles @xmath77 converges to zero . recalling ( [ abo ] ) we conclude that the sequence @xmath187 converges to zero as well .",
    "now let s look at the triangle @xmath134 and consider the geodesic through @xmath178 and a point @xmath188 on the geodesic segment @xmath189 , including both end points . since @xmath188 belongs to a closed and bounded curve ,",
    "there is such geodesic @xmath190 of maximal length .",
    "let s denote this length by @xmath191 , that is @xmath192 now we take the circular sector of radius @xmath191 , denoted by @xmath193 , centered at @xmath178 and bounded between two geodesics @xmath194 and @xmath11 with angle @xmath195 at @xmath178 .",
    "clearly , @xmath196 , and therefore @xmath197 since the sequence @xmath198 is certainly bounded and @xmath199 , when @xmath125 , the areas of @xmath193 will approach zero , which implies that @xmath200 now one can use formula ( [ abo ] ) to deduce that @xmath201 , which will contradict the assumption that @xmath202 in the triangle @xmath203 . a similar argument for @xmath129",
