    "statistical mechanics is based on kinetic theory .",
    "classical statistical mechanics derives from boltzmann s equation which is the evolution equation for the one - particle phase - space distribution function @xmath2 .",
    "the boltzmann equation itself results from the bbgky hierarchical correlation expansion of the liouville equation where the particular collision term is assumed to contain short range interactions only and all orders of correlations are neglected . in kinetic equilibrium",
    "the boltzmann collision term has as solution the celebrated maxwell - boltzmann distribution function @xmath3 as the basic distribution function of classical equilibrium statistical mechanics and thermodynamics .",
    "these equilibria are characterised by the action of boltzmann s @xmath1-theorem ( e.g. , @xcite ) proving that the time evolution of the thermodynamic system tends towards maximum boltzmannian entropy @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "both @xmath1-theorem and entropy are functionals of the boltzmann distribution , @xmath4 $ ] being the fundamental thermodynamic function . in the past ,",
    "generalisations of this entropy to quantum statistics of fermions and bosons have been very successful .",
    "in addition other quantum generalisations have been proposed to fractional statistics of anions by haldane @xcite and others .",
    "these generalisations were mostly based on probability counting statistics .",
    "the function @xmath3 has been widely used without justification to even describe collisionless equilibria or as the initial state of the evolution of collisionless systems .",
    "final states of such systems are often described in terms of a perturbation analysis as solutions of a velocity space diffusion process governed by the fokker - planck equation for which sometimes it can be demonstrated that a @xmath1-theorem similar to boltzmann s exists as well .",
    "such a situation as in quasilinear theory can be taken as justification for the validity of the perturbation approach . however , in collisionless systems containing strong correlations and consequently exhibiting interactions on all scales typical for strongly turbulent systems and phase transitions the fokker - planck perturbation approach may become invalidated .",
    "such systems sometimes can not be subordinated to boltzmannian statistical mechanics .",
    "moreover , measurements of velocity space and energy distribution functions in realistic natural systems frequently exhibit properties that are distinctly different from diffusive fokker - planck solutions @xcite .",
    "the observed ( classical ) distribution functions frequently asymptotically exhibit extended high energy tails of a certain nearly constant slope @xmath5 , with @xmath0 an arbitrary positive real number that is limited from below .",
    "such distributions have been tentatively named @xmath0 distributions and have been used in the past for interpretational purposes @xcite as well as for formal derivations @xcite , investigation of the dispersive properties of @xmath0-plasmas @xcite and calculation of their thermal fluctuation levels @xcite .",
    "all these facts lead to the question if not in collisionless systems equilibrium states may ( possibly temporarily ) evolve that are distinctly different from boltzmann equilibria .",
    "in fact , given a system containing some sufficiently large amount of free energy and being nearly collisionless , i.e. having a certain very small collision frequency @xmath6 , the evolution of the system will during its initial state be entirely independent of the presence of collisions between its particle constituents .",
    "instead it will undergo an instability , i.e. , the free energy will drive some of the fundamental eigen modes of the system unstable . as a consequence",
    ", the amplitudes of these modes will grow from their thermal level until they assume finite values , and the system will evolve into some previously non - existent structure",
    ". since collisions are very rare for times @xmath7 comparable to the linear time @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the linear growth rate , the system behaves initially linearly .",
    "the eigen - mode amplitudes grow exponentially until becoming large enough that the linear approximation breaks down .",
    "the system then enters into its non - linear state .",
    "let us assume that this state is quickly reached such that collisions are still unimportant .",
    "the further evolution of the system will then be determined by various non - linear effects like wave - wave interactions , wave - particle and non - linear wave - particle interactions , generation of anomalous collisions when the particles are scattered at the waves etc . in short ,",
    "the system becomes turbulent .",
    "the large - amplitude eigen - modes excite sideband waves , local inhomogeneity is introduced , and the system evolves into a state of coexistence of many different mutually interconnected scales affecting each other",
    ". the total power in the system will , in this state , start to behave fluctuating , possibly still growing and reorganising the system continuously .",
    "assume the non - linear time still being much shorter than the collision time , @xmath10 .",
    "for collisions still being negligible , this state may last for a certain possibly long turbulent time @xmath11 .",
    "such an evolution is sketched in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "the intermediate nonlinearly turbulent state represents a thermodynamic quasi - equilibrium state different from the purely stochastic thermodynamic equilibria described by the correlation - free boltzmann statistical mechanics .",
    "since the state is a quasi - equilibrium state , it should possess an equilibrium distribution function @xmath12 that is different from @xmath3 , and in addition its entropy should be approximately constant such that it assumes an intermediate approximate maximum for the time interval @xmath13 .",
    "clearly , when the final state of the system is approached at time @xmath14 , the system becomes collisional , and binary collisions will destroy the intermediate turbulent quasi - equilibrium .",
    "after @xmath15 , stochasticity dominates over the turbulent correlations , and the power contained in the turbulent fluctuations is readily converted into heat .",
    "the system then settles at its ultimate thermal equilibrium that is described by ordinary boltzmann statistical mechanics .",
    "the free parameter @xmath0 introduced above heuristically describes the deviation of the turbulent quasi - equilibrium distribution function from the boltzmann distribution .",
    "it contains the information about the actual turbulent processes and correlations in the system . in the absence of correlations and scale - invariance",
    "it will behave in a way that the quasi - equilibrium distribution approaches the boltzmann distribution .",
    "the motiviation for introducing @xmath0 follows the experimental literature and is thus purely traditional .",
    "however , as will be shown below , it turns out to be nevertheless practical . in a real turbulent system",
    "the entropy will still tend to increase slowly due to weak internal turbulent dissipation processes , but in an approximate theory we may assume that this increase is slow enough for the state to be considered stationary .",
    "these assumptions allow to ask for the possible form of the quasi - equilibrium distribution function @xmath16 and for the statistical mechanics of the equilibrium state described by it .",
    "the existence of a non - boltzmannian statistical mechanics has been suspected since the observation of lvy flights ( for an account of the current literature on this subject cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "lvy flights have been suspected to affect plasma transport and diffusion .",
    "the random walks caused by lvy flights have been shown to possess an approximate distribution function resembling the @xmath0 distribution @xcite though no ultimate theory of lvy flights is available yet .",
    "beginning with renyi @xcite intuitive but formal extensions of boltzmann s theory of the statistical entropy @xmath17 have been suggested in order to find different concepts for the entropy as the basic thermodynamic function of a modified statistical mechanics . a whole family of such formal generalisations could be imagined not all of them being of physical relevance .",
    "more recently @xcite a particular heuristic simplification of renyi s entropy has been proposed which seems to deserve some physical applicability but still lacks a basic physical or probabilistic foundation . among the applications proposed are diffusion @xcite , hydrodynamic turbulence @xcite and others .",
    "it has , moreover , been shown that the thermodynamic formalism could be extended to this kind of entropy @xcite , and the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite could be formulated as well .",
    "a disadvantage of this theory is that it apparently allows for a violation of the second law when entropic growth seems to be inhibited .",
    "such a behaviour is generally considered to be rather unphysical .",
    "its advantage over renyi s original proposal is its formal simplicity .    in this communication",
    "we construct the one - particle kinetic equivalent of the boltzmann equation which forms the physical basis for a generalised - lorentzian statistical mechanics .",
    "we demonstrate that in thermodynamic equilibrium its solution is the real and positive definite generalised - lorentzian phase space distribution function @xmath18^{- \\kappa } , \\label{eq : fkappa}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the ( non - relativistic ) particle energy , @xmath20 the chemical potential that is related to the fugacity @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is a certain normalisation constant ( extension to the relativistic or to non - ideal cases including external force fields is then straightforward ) .",
    "the lagrangean multiplier @xmath23 is a function of the temperature @xmath24 of the system , which is the physical observable , @xmath0 is a positive real valued but otherwise arbitrary number that can assume any positive value @xmath25 . for @xmath26 ,",
    "the above distribution smoothly approaches the boltzmann function @xmath3 .",
    "the final step in the bbgky kinetic theory of solution of the exact liouville equation for a many particle system is the one - particle kinetic equation for the one particle distribution function @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the one - particle liouville ( boltzmann ) operator acting in the one - particle phase space . the collision operator @xmath30 on the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : liou ] ) depends on the one and two - particle distribution functions @xmath31 , respectively , as well as on the particle number @xmath32 .",
    "it is a very complicated functional that in principle traces back through the entire hierarchy to the original @xmath32-particle liouville equation . in order to arrive at any physically useful solutions",
    "it must be approximated in some way .",
    "the most widely used approximations are boltzmann s hypothesis of statistical independence of the interactions in any kind of collisions and the collisionless assumption of vlasov .",
    "the latter leads to the neglect of the collision term , attributing all interactions to the action of the fields on the one - particle distribution function on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : liou ] ) .",
    "this assumption is very strong because even in the absence of any binary one - particle collisions , the action of the fields and very weak higher - order collisions on the level of the two - particle equation in the bbgky hierarchy may result in a non - vanishing one - particle collision term @xmath33 .",
    "this term may contain residual correlations and may thus not necessarily be of the correlation - free statistically independent boltzmann form proposing that @xmath34 is a functional of the product of two one - particle distribution functions only : @xmath35.\\ ] ] the form @xmath36 stands for @xmath37 , where the index @xmath38 designates the number of the particle involved whose position in momentum and configuration space are @xmath39 .",

    "the cross - section depends on the elementary physics of the collision process and has to be determined separately for the individual process in question . in central force fields",
    ", it becomes the boltzmann - rutherford cross section .",
    "for purely field - mediated interactions it is a complicate function .",
    "however , in order to determine the distribution function @xmath3 in thermal equilibrium , explicit knowledge of the differential cross - section is not needed .",
    "all that is required is that @xmath43 is positiv definite .",
    "this holds for any real physical process .",
    "the molecular chaos assumption underlying boltzmann s theory refers to the absence of all interactions between the particles other than binary with two - particle correlation function @xmath44\\approx f_1({\\bf p}_1)f_1({\\bf p}_2)$ ] .",
    "it thus reduces to @xmath44 $ ] to the product of the two one - particle distribution functions @xmath45 . in such an approach the binary interactions",
    "dominate on all scales and for all times , an assumption that has turned out very fruitful in classical statistical mechanics .",
    "however , as mentioned above , under certain conditions like scale - invariance this assumption may become violated .",
    "self - consistent field fluctuations may lead to long - range correlations in the system and clustering of particles in groups that behave similarly on many different scales . under such conditions",
    "molecular chaos will be replaced by chaos on larger scales that are dominated by correlations among the particles .",
    "clearly , such interactions depend crucially on the particular kind of correlation induced , and the general behaviour of the system becomes very difficult to investigate .",
    "there are two primary effects caused by such correlations .",
    "the first is a change in the differential cross - section . more important for our purposes here",
    "is the change induced in the two - particle correlation function @xmath44 $ ] in the collision integral ( [ eq : collbol ] ) . without explicit knowledge about the particular turbulent process",
    "it seems that little more could be said .",
    "however , in a first approach to a statistical theory one may follow boltzmann s approach and assume that even in the turbulent regime the one - particle distribution function still satisfied the lowest - order kinetic equation of the bbgky hierarchy , i.e. , boltzmann s equation ( [ eq : liou ] ) , but now with different ( turbulent ) collision term @xmath46 -g[12]\\ } \\label{eq : colltur}\\ ] ] that takes into account the correlations via the turbulent so far unspecified correlation functional @xmath47 $ ] . in this expression",
    "the positive definite turbulent differential cross - section @xmath48 contains the supposed interactions between the clustered groups of particles at different scales formally in the same way as in boltzmann s case .",
    "the explicit form of the cross - section is not of primary importance for our purposes in the following .",
    "its calculation for particular cases will be delayed to elsewhere .",
    "its nature to be a collisional cross section guaranties its positive definiteness .",
    "this is all we need here in developing an equilibrium theory .",
    "the turbulent conglomerates behave like superparticles . if this is the case , one can model the two - particle correlation function as the uncorrelated product of functionals @xmath49 $ ] of the one - particle distribution function tentatively describing the approximately uncorrelated interaction of the superparticles formed by the long range correlation of the particles in the system .",
    "the underlying assumption in this approach is that the long - range correlations become very weak on a sufficiently large scale such that the molecular chaos assumption holds again if the scale is chosen sufficiently large .",
    "in other words , the assumed scale - invariance must be broken at sufficiently large scales .",
    "this is certainly a valid assumption for most physical systems",
    ". then we can write @xmath50\\simeq g[f_1(1^\\prime ) ] g[f_1(2^\\prime ) ] -g[f_1(1 ) ] g[f_1(2 ) ] .",
    "\\label{eq : gfunc}\\ ] ] in accord with the previous discussion , higher order correlations are neglected in this representation .",
    "the so far unspecified mechanism of how the cluster conglomerates and congregates are formed and which part of the phase space is occupied by each of them is thereby buried in the particular functional form of @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "our primary task is to find an analytic expression for the functional @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "clearly , any rigorous theory should derive @xmath49 $ ] from the liouville equation or at least from the kinetic equation for the two - particle correlation function @xmath51 , i.e. from the second - lowest order equation in the bbgky hierarchy . here",
    "we follow a more heuristic elementary approach .",

    "however , because the underlying interaction between the particles remains to be deterministic , @xmath55 must be a function of the constants of motion only , viz .",
    "particle number and energy .",

    "assume @xmath97 particles to be distributed on @xmath98 quantum states in the phase space volume element , @xmath99 .",
    "the number of particles in state @xmath100 is @xmath101 .",
    "resolving the integral in ( [ eq : stsallis ] ) into a sum using this re - interpretation of @xmath102 , the entropy becomes @xmath103 , \\label{eq : tsallis}\\ ] ] which is a slightly rewritten version of tsallis definition of @xmath90 for @xmath104 .",
    "in this representation tsallis distinction between his cases @xmath105 and @xmath106 disappears and leaves the only physically reasonable case @xmath104 . moreover",
    ", because the entropy is the logarithm of the statistical weight , @xmath107 , we can identify @xmath108\\right\\}. \\label{eq : omega}\\ ] ] as the fundamental ` thermodynamic weight ' function .",
    "as in conventional statistical mechanics , @xmath107 can be written in terms of a product of the statistical weights of the @xmath100 states @xmath109\\right\\}^{n_k}. \\label{omegak}\\ ] ] one easily confirms that for @xmath26 this becomes the correct boltzmann statistical weight when identifying @xmath110 as the large-@xmath97 limit of @xmath111 .",
    "hence , eq .   ( [ omegak ] ) contains a large @xmath97 approximation . at the current stage it is not easily possible to resolve this approximation and to recover the correct form of the @xmath0-statistical weight .",
    "the form of @xmath112 given in ( [ omegak ] ) shows that the state counting process underlying the @xmath0-generalised statistical mechanics is highly complicated by the dominance of the correlations .",
    "obviously , the correlations contract the phase space to a reduced volume that may consist in a strange attractor , for instance .",
    "the degree and process of contraction is hidden in the exact value of @xmath0 , as well as in the above statistical weight function .    because @xmath112 contains the information about the ways of how the particles can be distributed in the @xmath100 states ( with degeneracy @xmath98 )",
    ", it also tells that for @xmath113 the distribution procedure is no simple stochastic process .",
    "interestingly , eq .  ( [ eq : tsallis ] ) corresponds to the definition of fractal dimensions through the natural measure of strange attractors @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the fraction of time a certain volume element @xmath38 on the basin of the attractor is visited by the orbits .",
    "given a resolution @xmath116 , one may write for the multi - fractal dimension @xmath117 , \\label{eq : dim}\\ ] ] where we defined the information ( neg - entropy ) @xmath118 $ ] , and @xmath119 is the number of intervals of lengths @xmath116 to cover the attractor ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) . note that @xmath0 is not a natural number here .",
    "since @xmath120 is a probability measure , one recognises that @xmath121 corresponds to the natural measure of the attractor , which in the continuous case is taken over by @xmath102 .",
    "this points on a close connection between the underlying nonlinear dynamics and the lorentzian statistical mechanics developed in the present communication . for @xmath64",
    "one recovers the information dimension @xmath122 while due to the boundedness of @xmath123 from below , the limit @xmath124 does not exist .",
    "this implies that the box - counting dimension is never realised .",
    "the multi - fractal dimensions are limited from above by @xmath125 .",
    "with the above instrumentation at hand one can investigate the behaviour of the ideal @xmath0-gas .",
    "normalising the distribution function eq .",
    "( 1 ) to the particle number density @xmath126 , we find @xmath127 where @xmath128 the latter function is interpreted as the grand partition function .",
    "it depends on the particle number @xmath32 , volume @xmath129 , the chemical potential @xmath20 and temperature functional @xmath23 , @xmath0 and on planck s constant @xmath130 . in order to find the entropy of the ideal gas one carries out the integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : stsallis ] ) .",
    "the result is @xmath131^{1/\\kappa } -1\\right\\ } , \\label{eq : sideal}\\ ] ] where @xmath132 is the known average particle density in the volume , and @xmath133 is the @xmath0-modified quantum density .",
    "it requires some nontrivial algebra to demonstrate that this expression actually becomes the classical boltzmann entropy in the limit @xmath64 , and that @xmath134 tends to approach @xmath135 .",
    "the above expression also suggests that in an ideal @xmath0-gas the boltzmann constant is modified and depends on the correlation properties of the gas through @xmath0 .",
    "this makes @xmath0 a sensible function of the macroscopic properties of the gas .",
    "in particular , @xmath136 will depend on the temperature @xmath24 because it is suspected that for @xmath137 the medium should become totally disordered . in this case @xmath138 , and classical boltzmann statistics will apply again .    in order to complete the formalism",
    "we identify the thermodynamic potential of the ideal gas with @xmath139 it allow to calculate the average particle density from @xmath140 however , the average density is a known quantity .",
    "hence this is an equation for the chemical potential of the ideal gas . inverting it for @xmath20",
    ", we obtain finally @xmath141^{2/(2\\kappa-5)}\\right\\}. \\label{eq : chempot}\\ ] ] from here all remaining thermodynamic quantities can be easily calculated .",
    "the last expression is of two - fold interest .",
    "it shows that the chemical potential of an ideal @xmath0-gas is negative because the quantum density is always considerably higher than the average density .",
    "implicitly we had made this assumption already in calculating the entropy when we assumed that the phase - space integrals would converge when integrating over the interval @xmath142 .",
    "positive chemical potentials may not be excluded , however , in non - ideal gases . in such cases the theory becomes naturally more involved .",
    "the most important observation is that the control parameter @xmath0 is bound from below by @xmath143 this limitation requires that the flattest physically possible distribution functions can only have slopes larger than 2.5 in energy space . it is interesting to note that observed distribution functions seem to satisfy this condition .",
    "extension to non - ideal gases are straightforward .",
    "one simply replaces @xmath144 with the full one - particle hamiltonian @xmath145 of the system including all interaction potentials .",
    "however , due to the complicate form of @xmath145 , approximation methods are needed in this case in order to calculate the thermodynamic functions and velocity moments .",
    "generalisation to the relativistic case requires the substitution @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the relativistic factor . in this way",
    "the present theory has all the potentialities of a kinetic theory .",
    "a further generalisation to the quantum case @xcite will be published elsewhere .",
    "we have presented a generalisation of the boltzmann equation to some special class of collision term that is not based on binary collisions .",
    "rather it takes into account long - range correlations between the particles .",
    "the equilibrium state of such systems is described by a generalised @xmath0 lorentzian distribution function with @xmath0 not necessarily being a rational function and being limited from below .",
    "it is also described by a particular form of the ( turbulent ) entropy @xmath90 .",
    "we believe that in collisionless systems close to criticality when long - range correlations dominate such thermodynamic equilibria will be realised . in future work",
    "is has to be shown , however , if and how the proposed collision term can be derived from the bbgky hierarchy .",
    "so far justification @xcite is given mainly by the surprisingly frequent experimental observation of @xmath0-like distributions in collisionless space plasmas .",
    "their high - energy tail slope generally agrees with the theoretical bound on @xmath0 found here .",
    "observed deviations at lower energies may be the result of different effects , not the least is the appearance of the chemical potential @xmath20 in the theoretically correct distribution which is not taken care of in the experimental fits .",
    "the present analysis leaves open a large number of questions that are related to the formal application of the lorentzian statistical mechanics to non - equilibrium processes , to its microscopic justification , as well as to the identification of the underlying process of state countings . at the present state of the theory it seems not easily possible to conclude about the counting procedure .",
    "clearly , the correlations acting on all scales do not permit for a simple random distribution of states as in gibbs - boltzmann statistical mechanics .",
    "it may be suspected that therefore the phase - space will not homogeneously be visited by the system under such conditions .",
    "only the strange attractor is visited frequently during the evolution of the system while large holes may exist in phase - space which are never even touched . in quasi - equilibirum",
    "the system will repeat to circulate on the strange attractor but even its coverage will not be homogeneous during the available time @xmath148 .",
    "it thus does not so much surprise that the statistical weight @xmath149 turns out to be an extremely complicated expression .",
    "as has been pointed out earlier in this paper any microscopic justification of the new statistical mechanics must identify the non - linear process .",
    "a more formal possiblity is to return to the second - lowest kinetic equation in the bbgky hierarchy , the equation for the two - particle distribution function @xmath150 $ ] , and to solve it under appropriate assumptions as for instance the neglect of collisions and correlations in this state .",
    "such a solution should probably yield a non - trivial collision integral that in the most general case will include correlations .",
    "it should be of considerable interest to determine , under which conditions this collision term can be brought into the form heuristically proposed in the present communication .",
    "another possibility is to use few - particle numerical simulations and to determine the structure of the distribution function when performing very many experiments with slightly different initial conditions .",
    "one of the fundamental questions concerns the meaning of the turbulent entropy @xmath90 .",
    "actually , the letter version of the present paper has been rejected from publication in physical review letters with the argument that it would make no sense to define a new entropy .",
    "it is clear , of course , that there is only one entropy in the universe , viz . disorder .",
    "however , the mathematical description of disorder can nevertheless require different expressions to describe entropy growth in different phases of the evolution of the system .",
    "in particular , under conditions when long - range correlations , scale invariance , or strong nonlinearity dominate over collisionality entropy may obey different laws than in boltzmann statistical mechanics .",
    "aside from these basic questions the structure of the new kinetic theory and the quasi - equilibrium distribution function lead to the important questions of the corresponding non - equilibrium and transport theories .",
    "the boundedness of the control parameter @xmath0 from below implies that only a limited number of fluid moments can in practice be determined from the distribution .",
    "what does this limitation imply ?",
    "does it hint on a self - closure of the turbulent system or does it force us to invent a new kind of moment calculation ? intuitively it seems to be clear that the particle number in the energetic tail of the lorentzian distribution must be limited in order to avoid a ultra - violet catastrophe .",
    "but what does it mean in reality ?",
    "obviously the number of particles in the tail is subject to self - limitation .",
    "too many energetic particles may drive the system into a stronger turbulence causing stronger scattering of the particles which may lead to bulk heating and otherwise limitation of the energetic particle flux .",
    "it is important to identify the actual process that governs this limiting cycle .",
    "only when this problem has been solved , a reliable transport theory can be developed .",
    "one of its ingredients is the turbulent cross section .",
    "we have shown that it is not important to be known for the determination of the equilibrium properties of the lorentzian gas . knowing the distribution function the average cross section can be calculated subsequently .",
    "this will be done in future work .",
    "we finally point on the many possiblities of applications of the new theory to collisionless thermodynamics , equilibria and stability processes , turbulence , radiation , and its extension to the quantum regime . some of these questions will be investigated elsewhere .",
