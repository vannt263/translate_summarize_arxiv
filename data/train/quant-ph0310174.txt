    "in this note we give a brief review of the combinatorial properties associated with the normal ordering of bosons , and the model feynman graphs which result .",
    "combinatorial sequences appear naturally in the solution of the boson normal ordering problem @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the normal ordering problem for canonical bosons @xmath0=1 $ ] is related to certain combinatorial numbers @xmath1 called stirling numbers of the second kind through @xcite @xmath2 with corresponding numbers @xmath3 called bell numbers . in fact , for physicists , these equations may be taken as the _ definitions _ of the stirling and bell numbers . for quons ( q - bosons ) satisfying @xmath0_q\\equiv aa^\\dag - qa^\\dag a=1 $ ]",
    "a natural q - generalisation @xcite of these numbers is @xmath4 in the canonical boson case , for integers @xmath5 we define generalized stirling numbers of the second kind @xmath6 through ( @xmath7 ) : @xmath8^n=(a^\\dag)^{n(r - s)}\\sum_{k = s}^{ns}s_{r , s}(n , k)(a^\\dag)^ka^k,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as well as generalized bell numbers @xmath9 @xmath10 for both @xmath6 and @xmath9 exact and explicit formulas have been found @xcite .",
    "we refer the interested reader to these sources for further information on those extensions .",
    "however , in this note we shall only deal with the classical bell and stirling numbers , corresponding to @xmath11 and @xmath12 in our notation .",
    "in general , for combinatorial numbers @xmath13 we may define an _ exponential generating function _ @xmath14 through @xcite @xmath15 for the bell numbers , the generating function takes the particularly nice form@xcite @xmath16 some initial terms of the sequence @xmath17 are @xmath18 .",
    "a convenient way of representing combinatorial numbers is by means of _ graphs_. to illustrate this , we now consider a graphical method for illustrating the combinatorial numbers associated with the normal order expansion of @xmath19 .",
    "a single arrow represents a `` time - segment '' of a line corresponding to the `` propagator '' @xmath20 .",
    "thus we may concatenate one , two or more arrows to form a single line , or propagator @xmath20 .",
    "however , two lines correspond to two distinct propagators @xmath21 , and so on .",
    "further , the constitutent arrows are labelled , for example by time , and so they may only be concatenated respecting the time ordering .",
    "these rules are illustrated by the diagrams of figure 1 , in which we consider the cases of 1 , 2 , and 3 arrows respectively .",
    "we have pre - emptively labelled these numbers as bell numbers - which fact we demonstrate below .",
    "for the case of 4 arrows ( figure 2 ) we have additionally given the individual associated symmetry factors ( in fact stirling numbers ) which add to @xmath22 .",
    "it should be clear from this illustration how the time - ordering rules are applied to give the symmetry coefficients .",
    "thus there is only one way in which we can concatenate 4 arrows respecting time - ordering ( first grouping ) , 4 ways in which we can divide the arrows into a set of 3 and 1 , and so on .    from these first few examples it would seem that these graphs are essentially like the feynman diagrams of a zero - dimensional ( no integration ) model field theory associated with @xmath23",
    ". in other words , at order @xmath24 the total number of graphs would appear to be @xmath25 while the individual coefficients of @xmath26 are given by @xmath1 . in order to show that this is indeed the case",
    ", we must be able to count the number of graphs associated with a given number @xmath24 of arrows . to do this",
    "we can use the first of three great results .",
    "this first great result is sometimes known as the _ connected graph theorem _ @xcite .",
    "it states that if @xmath27 is the generating function of _ labelled connected _ graphs , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath28 counts the number of connected graphs of order @xmath24 , then @xmath29 is the generating function for _ all _ graphs",
    ".    we may apply this very simply to the case of the arrow graphs above . for each order @xmath24 , the connected graphs consist of the single graph obtained by concatenating all the arrows into one propagator . therefore for each @xmath24",
    "we have @xmath30 ; whence , @xmath31 it follows that the generating function for all the arrow graphs @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 which is the generating function for the bell numbers .",
    "such graphs may be generalised to give graphical representations for the extensions @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "however , just as an abstract group is capable of more than one presentation , there are many graphical representations for a given combinatorial sequence ; and we now give an alternative one for the numbers @xmath34 due to bender and collaborators @xcite , @xcite .",
    "as before , we shall be counting lines .",
    "a line starts from a white dot , the _ origin _ , and ends at a black dot , the _",
    "vertex_. what we refer to as _ origin _ and _ vertex _ is , of course , arbitrary . at this point",
    "there are no other rules , although we are at liberty to impose further restrictions ; a white dot may be the origin of 1,2,3 , ... lines , and a black dot the vertex for 1,2,3 , ... lines . we may further associate _ strengths _ @xmath35 with each vertex receiving @xmath36 lines , and multipliers @xmath37 with a white dot which is the origin of @xmath38 lines . again",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 play symmetric roles ; in this note we shall only consider cases where the @xmath37 are either @xmath41 or @xmath42 .",
    "we illustrate these rules for four different graphs corresponding to @xmath43 .",
    "there is an generating function @xmath44 which counts the number @xmath13 of graphs with @xmath24 lines arising from the above rules @xcite : @xmath45    consider the following example : @xmath46 for all @xmath47 , that is , we allow only one line from each origin ( with multiplier 1 ) ; there is no restriction on the number of lines to a vertex , and @xmath48 for all @xmath36 .",
    "we give an example of the cases @xmath49 in figure 4 .",
    "note that for correct counting the lines should be labelled , as they were in the case of the arrows above .",
    "the generating function @xmath14 which counts the lines corresponding to the above rules follows immediately from eq.([fgr ] ) @xmath50    the penultimate step is a consequence of the taylor expansion .",
    "we thus have yet another representation of the integer sequence @xmath17 .",
    "note that when @xmath51 and @xmath52 are integer sequences we obtain an integer sequence from eq.([fgr ] ) . a convenient method of obtaining the resulting integer sequence is afforded by the next useful result .",
    "straightforward manipulation of series shows the following : define @xmath53 then if @xmath54 we have @xmath55 this is a useful and rather surprising equality .",
    "using the results of the previous section , eq.([prod ] ) enables us to create graphical representations of _ products _ of integral sequences .",
    "for example : if in the case above we chose @xmath56 for all @xmath38 , enabling any number of lines from each origin ( with multiplier 1 ) , the resulting sequence of graphs would have given us a representation of the integer sequence @xmath57 @xcite .        from eqs.([genprod ] ) and ( [ prod ] ) , the required generating function is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the generating function for @xmath17 and @xmath61 is that of @xmath62 .",
    "note that @xmath63 from eq.([bell ] ) , while @xmath64 .",
    "this shows that the graphs for the sequence @xmath65 may be obtained by putting @xmath56 for all @xmath38 , so that there are any number of lines emanating from an origin , and with multiplicity 1 . for the sequence @xmath62 we have @xmath66 for all @xmath67 and @xmath68 , so that any number of lines may end at a vertex , and all have strength 1 except for the case where _ two _ lines meet at a vertex , when the strength is 2 .",
    "the generating function is , according to eq.([prod ] ) , @xmath69 it may be explicitly obtained after some formal algebraic manipulation based on the dobiski formula @xcite @xmath70 as @xmath71 the formal series ( [ g1 ] ) diverges for all @xmath72 , although having finite taylor coefficients for @xmath73 .",
    "such formal series are nevertheless useful in representing integer sequences .    in our last example",
    "we retain all the derivative terms in eq.([genprod ] ) but choose @xmath74 , thus allowing vertices where at most _ two _ lines meet .",
    "the corresponding generating function is defined by @xmath75 where the _ involution numbers _",
    "@xmath76 are defined through their generating function @xmath77 and are special values of the hermite polynomials @xmath78",
    "@xmath79 consequently @xmath80 in obtaining eq.([e2 ] ) we have used the standard form of the generating function of the hermite polynomials . again , we must consider the series eqs.([g2 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) as formal power series , since for example they diverge for @xmath72 .    in conclusion , we emphasize that the expressions of eqs.([g1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) constitute exact solutions of model field theories defined by the appropriate sets @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
