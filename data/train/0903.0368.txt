    "the scorpio centaurus ( sco@xmath0cen ) ob association is one of the most important sites of recent star formation in the solar neighborhood .",
    "this association consists of three subgroups : lower centaurus crux ( lcc ) , upper centaurus lupus ( ucl ) and upper scorpius ( us ) ( blaauw 1964 , de zeeuw et al .",
    "according to their nuclear ages , determined considering both high and low mass stars , lcc and ucl are older with ages between 16 and 18 myr ( sartori et al . 2003 , mamajek et al . 2002 ) while us is younger with an age of about 5 myr ( preibisch and zinnecker 1999 , preibisch and mamajek 2008 ) .",
    "it should be noted that blaauw ( 1978 , 1991 ) , using an independent method of measuring ages based on stellar kinematics , found a similar result for us .",
    "this already characterizes us as an unbound stellar system .",
    "the energetic output of massive stars in ob associations can significantly affect the interstellar medium ( ism).an interesting possible outcome of this interaction is the so - called triggered or assisted star formation as opposed to spontaneous .",
    "not only isolated stars but entire groups of stars are thought to be formed by way of the triggered star formation mode .",
    "the creation of expanding bubbles and shells in the ism by winds from massive hot stars and supernova ( sn ) explosions are key ingredients in triggered star formation .",
    "in fact , during the expansion the shell may become gravitationally unstable due to increased density resulting from the accumulation of swept - up gas and dust ( elmegreen and lada 1977 ) or from the action of sn explosions in the associated bubble ( mccray and kafatos 1987 ) .",
    "the instability fragments the shell leading to the formation of dense molecular clouds and eventually to the formation of star groups and clusters .",
    "another possibility is that , during the expansion , shock fronts associated with shells may compress clouds existing in the ism and ignite star formation",
    ". one interesting characteristic of triggered star formation is that it can propagate and form several star groups or associations . increasing observational evidences of this mode of star formation in our galaxy and in external nearby galaxies",
    "have been reported .",

    "the interaction of the stars with the ism and triggered star formation have been addressed by several authors : weaver ( 1979 ) , cappa de nicolau and pppel ( 1986 ) , de geus ( 1992 ) . according to preibisch and zinnecker ( 1999 ) ( see also preibisch and mamajek 2008 ) , the narrow range of ages observed in us supports the view that the formation of this subgroup took place via the triggering mode .",
    "an sn exploding in ucl is assumed to be the triggering agent initiating the burst of star formation .",
    "several young stellar associations mainly composed of pre - main sequence stars like @xmath1 pictoris ( bpmg ) ( barrado y navascus et al . 1999 , zuckerman et al .",
    "2001 , ortega et al . 2002 , 2004 ) , tw hydrae ( twa ) ( de la reza et al .",

    "this can shed light on the question of the way , or ways , these stellar systems were formed .",
    "the approach we adopt is based on the calculation of the past three - dimensional orbits of all the systems involved .",
    "we also compute the evolution of the shells associated with the bubbles created by the subcomponents lcc and ucl .",
    "the expectation is that a formation scenario of the groups bpmg , twa and of @xmath2 cha can be obtained by following their temporal evolution combined with the evolution of lcc , ucl and the shells of these sco@xmath0cen subcomponents .",
    "we expect that this scenario will help us answer to several general questions concerning this problem : what was the formation mode of the loose unbound associations the bpmg , twa and of the compact cluster @xmath2 cha ? were these systems originated in the shells formed by the bubbles blown by lcc and ucl ? or did the birth of these stellar groups occur exterior to the shells ?",
    "finally , had the formation of us something to do with this process ?",
    "a related point concerns the role played by the sne that certainly existed in lcc and ucl . did the formation of the groups take place as a consequence of the direct action of sne on the shells ? or was this action more indirect by contributing to the formation of the bubbles and shells ?",
    "all these questions are important and , obviously , one can not hope to obtain detailed answers to all of them by only using stellar and shell dynamics .",
    "nonetheless this approach can provide a valuable general picture of star formation in the region of the sco@xmath0cen association .",
    "the methodology of calculating the stellar three - dimensional past evolution of young associations has been employed by us in previous works ( ortega et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 , jilinski et al .",
    "2005 and de la reza et al .",
    "2006 ) to get estimates of their ages and places of origin .",
    "this is realized by backward integration of the orbits of all the stars of the groups taking into account the ( modeled ) gravitational potential of the galaxy .",
    "the region of first maximum concentration of the orbits ( confinement ) we consider to be the birthplace of the stellar group ; the time interval , from today , we consider to be the age of the group .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the orbit confinement region leads to a star distribution pattern at birth that can be considered as a representation of the density distribution in the natal cloud .",
    "one example is the bpmg , whose dynamical age of 11.2 myr can serve as calibrator for other pre - main sequence systems which lack age determination but have similar youth features .",
    "this can be of importance , for instance , in the investigation of the temporal evolution of associated protoplanetary disks .",
    "apart from getting age estimates , this method is very efficient in detecting intruding stars .",
    "this method can also be used to look for new , potential , members of a group on the basis of the confinement of their past orbits in the previously determined formation region of the group .",
    "furthermore , the confinement must take place at the previously determined age of the group under investigation .",
    "this condition is far more stringent than the simple comparison of the present - day kinematics.as an example , using this technique and a compilation , brought together by us containing more then 30,000 stars with hipparcos entries and radial velocity measurements , we were able to pick five new potential members of the bpmg .",
    "they are included in table 1 where we briefly comment on them .",
    "to confirm , or reject , the membership of these systems to the bpmg , further properties , typical of the group , should be investigated . in table 2",
    "we list the stars which likely are related to the bpmg .",
    "although they do not find themselves in the confinement region of the bpmg , they are spatially in its neighborhood at the age of bpmg .",
    "they may have formed not in group but in a more isolated fashion . to these systems",
    "we ascribe the same age of the bpmg .",
    "table 3 contains the stars which very probably have no relation to the bpmg because their orbits take them far away from this group .",
    "they can be considered as interlopers .",
    "a similar exercise realized for twa with an age of 8.3 myr did not give any additional potential members , probably because of the small number of stars with full kinematic data in the association .",
    "the existence of two modes of star formation , in group and isolated , seems to be quite common in associations , as in orion complex(lee and chen 2006 ) for example .",
    "can we identify some formation mechanism capable of giving origin to these modes ? in the following , we shall present a formation scenario in which such a mechanism could exist .",
    "stellar and shell kinematics have been used to study the velocity distribution of stars in expanding shells ( moreno et al .",
    "1999 ) and also as a tracer of triggered star formation ( comeron et al .",
    "1998 , comeron 2001 ) . in the next section",
    "we shall investigate the evolution of stars and shells in the region of the sco@xmath0cen ob association.a distinctive feature of our work is that we take into account the temporal evolution of structures from the past to the present .",
    "in figues 1 , 2 , 3 we show the past positions of the stellar groups the bpmg , twa and @xmath2 cha at the epochs of their formation as obtained by us in previous works ( ortega et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 , jilinski et al .",
    "2005 , de la reza et al .",
    "2006 ) using the method mentioned in the previous section . in these figures the axes @xmath3 are positive oriented in the directions of the galactic center , the galactic rotation and above the galactic plane respectively .",
    "the positions of the stellar subcomponents lcc and ucl are also shown in these figures .",
    "a common and intriguing aspect of these plots is the location , at birth , of the bpmg and twa behind lcc and ucl while @xmath2 cha shows a somewhat different relative configuration .",
    "what is the origin of such groups disposition ?",
    "is it possible to find a formation scenario compatible with such a disposition ?",
    "( ortega et al .",
    "2006)to investigate this question we consider the evolution of the bubbles and shells originated by lcc and ucl in addition to their stellar components .",
    "the bubbles are blown by the combined action of the winds of hot stars and sne .",
    "to compute the effective resulting `` mechanical luminosity '' we use the contribution of stellar winds and the number of expected sne in lcc and ucl found by de geus ( 1992 ) and take 18 myr as a mean age for both subcomponents . in the case of an association",
    "it is necessary to take into consideration the fact that the creation of a common , for all the stars , bubble is not a point , instantaneous process , but one extended in space and time .",
    "every star of the association , mainly the hot ones , is contributing to this process .",
    "a common , for the whole association , shock can be said to have formed when the stars of the association turn out to be within it .",
    "this fixes the initial radius @xmath4 and the initial time @xmath5 for the expansion of the shock .",
    "the mass of the ambient medium will be swept up by the common shock thereafter for @xmath6 and we assume that this takes place in a uniform ism of number density 100 @xmath7 and molecular weight 2.8 . to follow the time evolution of the shells created by the ucl and lcc",
    "we integrate numerically the system of equations given by castor et al .",
    "( 1975 ) :    @xmath8    @xmath9    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the radius , @xmath12 is the pressure exerted on the shell by the hot bubble of thermal energy @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the ism density , and @xmath15 is the `` mechanical luminosity '' , that is , the rate at which the energy is generated in the bubble .",
    "values for the initial thermal and kinetic energies were calculated from the solution of weaver at al .",
    "( 1977 ) ( see also mac low and mccray 1988 )",
    ". making use of the initial mass of the shell computed as @xmath16 , we determine a value for the initial velocity of the shell .",
    "solutions for the expansion of the shells can be computed with and without the contribution of the sns to the mechanical luminosity . in both cases ,",
    "we take @xmath17 pc as the initial radius and start the integration at the initial time @xmath18 myr .",
    "figure 4(a ) shows the solutions for the shells of ucl and lcc without the contributions of the sns . from this figure",
    "we see that although there is a certain approach between the shells , they do not come into contact .",
    "table 4 lists and figure 4(b ) shows the details of the solution ( the radii and velocities of the ucl and lcc shells ) for the case where both , stellar winds and sns , contribute to the mechanical energy supplied to the bubbles . as in the previous case",
    "the shells gradually approach each other but now , about 9 myr , they have met together starting the process of interaction between them ( figure 7 ) . in the narrowing process of the approaching shells a supersonic flow is expected to arise in the funnel created by them .",
    "we identify the flow so formed as a physical mechanism which could be responsible for the formation of the bpmg and twa ( figures 5 and 6 ) . in the case of twa",
    "an additional trigger can be present besides the pressure field originated by the funneling of the shells : in fact , a mach shock is expected to arise as a result of the shells collision ( figure 7 ) .",
    "such mechanisms can explain quite naturally why the stellar groups the bpmg and twa were born in the wake of lcc and ucl .",
    "they can also explain the formation of isolated star systems , as is the case in the neighborhood of the bpmg .",
    "shells collisions have been proposed by chernin et al .",
    "( 1995 ) as a mechanism of violent star formation .",
    "characteristic of this process is the appearance of two reflected shocks which , dragging material from the region of collision , move to the internal areas of the bubbles giving rise to the formation of `` champagne flows '' . in figure 8",
    "we show the position of the @xmath2 cha cluster at the time of its birth , 6.7 myr ago , determined previously by us ( jilinski et al . 2005 ) ; @xmath2 cha is at the shell of lcc and by this time the `` champagne flow '' has advanced into the lcc bubble .",
    "we identify the `` champagne flow '' in this region as the mechanism triggering the formation of the @xmath2 cha cluster .",
    "another interesting point refers to the reflected shock which surged into the bubble of ucl in a direction symmetric relative to the first one . in figure 9",
    "we show the situation at @xmath19 myr , the age of us formation ( preibisch and zinnecker 1999 , preibisch and mamajek 2008 ) . at this time",
    "point us is in the shell of ucl .",
    "the configuration is such that the `` champagne flow '' created by the reflected shock should have interacted with the shell of ucl igniting the burst of star formation which may have given origin to the us subcomponent .",
    "in the introduction we posed some questions concerning the origin of young stellar groups in the region of the sco@xmath0cen ob association and wondered whether using stellar and shell dynamics , considered in their time evolution , would give us clues to tackle those questions .",
    "we found that this approach leads to a picture in which quite different physical mechanisms capable of inducing star formation can occur . according to this picture ,",
    "the unbound groups the bpmg and twa were born in regions of the medium between lcc and ucl , the source of overpressure being the flow generated by the approaching shells of these subcomponents and the mach shock arisen after the shells have come together . on the other hand ,",
    "the formation of the compact cluster @xmath2 cha took place quite differently , the trigger being one of the energetic `` champagne flows '' arising as a result of the collision of the shells of lcc and ucl .",
    "are such formative differences reflected in the observed properties of the bpmg , twa , and @xmath2 cha ?",
    "this seems in fact to be the case .",
    "table 5 contains , and figures 10 , 11 , and 12 show the velocity components of the stellar groups the bpmg , twa , and @xmath20 cha relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) at the epochs of their formation .",
    "the velocity components of lcc and ucl are also included .",
    "all the groups have @xmath21 components negative , that is , contrary to the galactic rotation .",
    "this reflects the peculiar motion of the gas complex . at the same time",
    ", all the groups have @xmath22 components positive ( the direction to the galactic center ) , that is , in the course of time they will loose rotational support until the galactic rotation takes over . how does the situation at these epochs look relative to the average motion of lcc and ucl ?",
    "table 6 and figure 13 present the velocity components of the bpmg , twa and @xmath2 cha in this reference system at the times of their formation .",
    "we see that the bpmg has the largest positive @xmath21 component , equal to 2.4 km s@xmath23 .",
    "this is consistent with the proposed mechanism of gas flux produced by compression and also explains why the bpmg is farther away from lcc . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath21 component of twa is also positive but significantly smaller than that of the bpmg which is consistent with the final stage of compression resulting from the shells collision 9 myr ago .",
    "finally , the @xmath21 component of @xmath2 cha is negative and quite small , whereas its @xmath22 component is larger and , in the galactic anticenter direction , consistent with a triggering action due to the `` champagne flow '' .",
    "the sequence shown by figure 13 strongly suggests the occurrence of one process , involving several triggering mechanisms , taking place during the temporal evolution of the sco@xmath0sen subcomponents lcc and ucl .    in figure 14",
    "we show the situation at the epoch 13 myr ago , when the common shell was formed and the region where the bpmg would be formed at about 11 myr ago .",
    "it can be wondered whether such 2 myr time intervals would be sufficient to produce the necessary compression of the medium between lcc and ucl to induce the formation of the bpmg .",
    "could nt a different , additional more powerful triggering mechanism , be involved in the formation of that stellar group ?",
    "a sn event occurring in lcc prior to the formation of the common shell , for example ? note that this would also be consistent with the dynamical constraints and would not contradict figure 13 .",
    "such a possibility was investigated by us in a previous work ( ortega et al .",
    "2004 ) where an attempt was made to identify the probable sn responsible for the formation of the bpmg",
    ". unfortunately , large uncertainties in the radial velocity of the suspected runaway star made this attempt inconclusive .",
    "better radial velocities are needed in order to get reliable three - dimensional orbits of runaway stars .    aside from the bound nature of @xmath2 cha ,",
    "further differences have been reported in the literature .",
    "moraux et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , for example , emphasize its very compact configuration , the absence of wide binaries and mass segregation in this young cluster .",
    "all these features point to a violent formation of @xmath2 cha . interestingly",
    ", the position of the us subcomponent in the shell of ucl 5 myr ago follows from our past orbits calculations of us using the present positions and velocities of its stars , and also from the modeled evolutions of the shells .",
    "it is worth noting that the formation of us in the shell of ucl may have been triggered by the `` champagne flow '' arising from the collision of the shells of lcc and ucl .",
    "it should be stressed that the ambient mean number density of 100 @xmath7 used in the calculations is not arbitrary because it must satisfy dynamical constraints set by the orbits of the stellar groups and the evolution of the shells .    how does the mass swept up by the shells with",
    "the mass observed today in the region of the sco@xmath0cen association ?",
    "the masses of the shells up to -9.0 myr , the time when they collided , given by our solutions are @xmath24 for lcc and @xmath25 for ucl ( see table 4 ) .",
    "this gives a total mass of @xmath26 , consistent with the value of about @xmath27 quoted by weaver ( 1979 ) .",
    "we compare this value with the mass seen today in the adjacent regions of lcc and ucl . for the h",
    "i loops surrounding today the subcomponents lcc , ucl and us , de geus ( 1992 ) found a mass of @xmath28 .",
    "in addition to this there is mass in the form of molecular clouds . in figure 15 ,",
    "constructed using the catalog of dutra and bica ( 2002 ) , we show the present - day situation .",
    "one identifies molecular gas aggregates such as the chamaeleontis clouds , the lupus clouds , the ophiuchus complex , the coma australis molecular cloud and others .",
    "according to table 1 of ballesteros - paredes and hartmann ( 2007 ) , the mass in these molecular clouds amounts to @xmath29 , which added to the previous @xmath28 h i mass found by de geus ( 1992 ) gives a mass of @xmath30 .",
    "in addition to this , the aquila rift molecular cloud , with a mass of @xmath31 , has been often genetically related to the sco@xmath0cen association ( for example straiys et al .",
    "then the overall identifiable mass in the region will be @xmath32 .",
    "if we do not include in this value the mass @xmath33 for the lcc h i loop found by de geus ( 1992 ) , the resulting value @xmath34 is consistent with the mass associated with the ucl shell .",
    "as regards lcc , quite a lot of mass would remain unidentifiable today and the scenario here proposed would be indicating that a sizeable quantity of mass has been leaving the system during the last 5 - 6 myr , most probably in the direction of the galactic anticenter ( as suggested by figures 8 and 9 ) , a low density region in which the sun is located at present . in this respect , it is pertinent to note that de geus ( 1992 ) in his analysis of the present - day situation found no evidence of expanding gas associated with the lcc subcomponent .",

    "<S> the main objective of this work is to investigate the role played by lower centaurus crux ( lcc ) and upper centaurus lupus ( ucl ) , both subcomponents of the scorpio centaurus ob association ( sco@xmath0cen ) , in the formation of the groups @xmath1 pictoris , tw hydrae and the @xmath2 chamaeleontis cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical evolution of all the stellar groups involved and of the bubbles and shells blown by lcc and ucl are calculated and followed from the past to the present . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a formation scenario in which ( 1 ) the groups @xmath1 pictoris , tw hydrae were formed in the wake of the shells created by lcc and ucl , ( 2 ) the young cluster @xmath2 chamaeleontis was born as a consequence of the collision of the shells of lcc and ucl , and ( 3 ) the formation of upper scorpius ( us ) , the other main subcomponent of the sco@xmath0cen association , may have been started by the same process that created @xmath2 chamaeleontis . </S>"
