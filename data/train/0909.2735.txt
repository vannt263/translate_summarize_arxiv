    "[ sec : intro ]    several observations of traffic flow result in underlining two different behaviors , sometimes called _ phases _ , see  @xcite . at low density and high speed , the flow appears to be reasonably described by a function of the ( mean ) traffic density . on the contrary , at high density and low speed ,",

    "there exists a uniform bound on the speed .    by _",
    "`` bound '' _ , here we do not necessarily mean an official speed limit . on the contrary , we assume that different drivers may have different speeds at the same traffic density .",
    "nevertheless , there exists a speed @xmath2 that no driver exceeds . as a result from this postulate",
    ", we obtain a fundamental diagram very similar to those usually observed , see  figure  [ fig : ex ] and figure  [ fig : phases ] , left . besides , the evolution prescribed by the model so obtained is reasonable and coherent with that of other traffic models in the literature .",
    "in particular , we verify that the minimal requirements stated in  @xcite are satisfied .",
    "recall the classical lighthill - whitham  @xcite and richards  @xcite ( lwr ) model @xmath3 for the traffic density @xmath4 .",

    "we identify the different behaviors of the different drivers by means of their maximal speed , see also  @xcite .",
    "one is thus lead to study the equations @xmath9 here , the role of the second equation is to let the maximal velocity @xmath6 be propagated with the traffic speed .",
    "indeed , @xmath6 is a specific feature of every single driver , in other words is a lagrangian marker .",

    "so we could use the approach and the theoretical results of  @xcite , which should apply here with minor modifications .",
