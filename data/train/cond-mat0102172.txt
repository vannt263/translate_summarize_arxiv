    "we have evaluated @xmath42 but find that it approaches finite values ( indicating insulating behavior ) throughout the phase diagram of the disordered two dimensional hubbard model at half - filling .",

    ", however , the physics becomes rather similar to the bond disordered case , with af correlation extending to very large values of disorder , and a signature of a mott transition in the compressibility .",
    "the enlargement of the paramagnetic phase space at the expense of the antiferromagnetically ordered mott and anderson phases is presumably a consequence of the existence , with site disorder , of potential wells on which pairs can form , destroying the moments .",
    "similarly , we observe that on - site disorder is more effective at eliminating the charge gap than bond disorder .",
    "we used these , and other , sweeps of disorder strength at fixed interaction to generate the full uhf ground state phase diagrams of the site- and bond - disordered two dimensional hubbard models as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : uhfbond ] and  [ fig : uhfsite ] . we observed both antiferromagnetically ordered anderson and mott insulating phases , and a paramagnetic anderson insulating region .",

    "@xmath77 af lro is never destroyed by disorder even at relatively modest values of the interaction , e.g. , @xmath78 for bond disorder and @xmath79 for site disorder .",
    "the ground - state cpqmc method was developed to study correlated lattice electrons where no special particle - hole symmetry exists to eliminate the sign problem .",
    "it applies techniques that are a hybrid of determinant quantum monte carlo  @xcite ( dqmc ) and diffusion monte carlo  @xcite ( dmc ) methods .    like the dqmc technique , the method employs the hubbard - stratonovich ( hs ) transformation to decouple the interaction term of the hamiltonian , @xmath80 the result is a quadratic hamiltonian in which the interaction between electrons has been replaced by the interaction of independent electrons with a classical fluctuating field .",
    "sampling over the possible values of the hs field reproduces the original electron - electron interaction .",
    "this quadratic hamiltonian can then be used in an imaginary time propagation of a slater determinant , allowing projection of the ground state from an initial trial wave function : @xmath81 .",
    "the similarity to the dmc method comes from the fact that the imaginary time propagation is represented by an ensemble of random walkers .",
    "( however , the random walk in the cpqmc method is performed in a space of slater determinants , in contrast to the dmc method where the random walk is in configuration space . )",
    "the constrained path approximation , necessary for dealing with negative weights , is similar in spirit to the fixed node  @xcite approximation commonly used to study correlated fermions in the continuum .",
    "it imposes a boundary condition in determinant space with a trial wave function , which constrains the random walkers to half of the over - complete determinant space .",
    "the details of the cpqmc algorithm have been discussed elsewhere  @xcite , but we will provide a brief description followed by a discussion of the necessary adjustments to treat disorder and the observables of interest .      at any time in the cpqmc simulation , the wave function is represented by an ensemble of random walkers . more specifically , we work in a single slater determinant basis and represent our wave function at imaginary time step @xmath82 by @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is an individual walker ( slater determinant ) .",

    ", we discretize the propagator to a series of short time steps , @xmath88 .",
    "this allows us to apply the trotter approximation @xmath89 and isolate the potential energy @xmath68 from the kinetic energy @xmath90 .",

    "the interaction part of the propagator is now a function of the hs field .    because of the special form of the propagator , each slater determinant @xmath96 in the representation of the wave function at imaginary time step @xmath82",
    "is transformed into another slater determinant @xmath97 at imaginary time step @xmath98 .",
    "we thereby apply the incremental projection operator repeatedly to the wave function of our system to project out the ground state . in order to make the sampling more efficient",
    "we can employ an importance function to modify the original probability distribution , as has been discussed.@xcite as in the dqmc algorithm , the computation time in the cpqmc algorithm scales roughly as @xmath99 per random walk step , where @xmath100 is the number of spatial sites in the lattice and @xmath101 is the number of walkers .",
    "the cpqmc algorithm is exact up to this point .",
    "a remaining issue is the constraint to deal with the sign problem , which is usually implemented with the importance function .",
    "we define the overlap integral @xmath102 , and demand that individual walkers maintain a positive @xmath103 , i.e. , that they do not cross the boundary @xmath104 in their random walk in slater determinant space .",

    "the constraint is an approximation , whose quality depends on the quality of the trial wave function @xmath105 .",
    "monte carlo methods such as the cpqmc technique that employ trial wave functions are well suited for calculating the ground - state energy , and initial work on the cpqmc method@xcite demonstrated an excellent agreement of the ground state energy with exact approaches in cases where exact results were available.@xcite in the appendix , we will demonstrate that this agreement , though a bit less accurate , extends to our simulations .    in the body of the paper",
    ", however , we will focus on real space magnetic order which can be identified by measuring the correlation function , @xmath106 here @xmath107 is the @xmath34 component of the local spin operator , and @xmath100 is the total number of lattice sites .",

    "may be settled by examining the scaling properties on lattices of different size .",
    "spin wave theory @xcite predicts @xmath120 here @xmath53 is the sublattice magnetization in the thermodynamic limit , and @xmath121 is the maximal separation on a square lattice of linear size @xmath122 with periodic boundary conditions . @xmath123 and",
    "@xmath124 provide two quantities to extrapolate the value of the ground state order parameter .",

    "[ eq : eq5 ] and [ eq : eq6 ] ] , which one might expect to find in comparing mean field and qmc treatments .",
    "first , because of the relatively modest spatial lattice sizes being simulated in the qmc scheme , over the course of a typical run the simulation is able to explore the equivalent states that have a surplus of up - spin electrons and a surplus of down - spin electrons on a given site . in the thermodynamic limit , like a real material ,",
    "the simulation could get stuck in one or the other , but our lattice sizes are not large enough for that to happen . as a consequence ,",

    "[ eq : scaling ] . meanwhile , mft is able to study @xmath53 directly .",
    "second , mft has a well - known tendency to over - estimate the sharpness of the behavior of the local moment as a function of the ratio of interaction strength to band - width .",
    "for example , even in the clean system , phase transitions associated with magnetic long - range order are often associated also with abrupt formation of local moments .",
    "however , it is well established that within the qmc method the evolution of the local moment is much less abrupt.@xcite for both these reasons , we do not expect to be able to observe any spin - glass ( sg ) phase transition within the qmc method , nor indeed do we see one . in this work",
    "we are only able to report that the sg transition observed in mft at half - filling in the three - dimensional model apparently does not occur within the same mf treatment in two dimensions .",
    "spin - glass order in interacting fermi systems has generated much interest recently , but most investigations have relied on field theoretic and renormalization - group - type techniques .  @xcite    the effect of disorder on the size or existence of the mott gap in the cpqmc method is an interesting question that will not be considered in detail in this work .",
    "we have measured the density as a function of chemical potential@xcite and the compressibility , and find the mott gap is rather strongly reduced by site disorder and considerably less affected by bond disorder,@xcite but we leave a detailed analysis to a later presentation .",
    "in this section we address the primary point of interest in the paper , the effect disorder has on the long - range magnetic order of the half - filled 2d hubbard model .",
    "in particular , we want to determine the critical disorder strength necessary to destroy the magnetically ordered ground state and ascertain the accuracy of the uhf phase diagram .",
    "we concentrate on the case where @xmath3 , where the uhf shows no transition to a paramagnetic order .",
    "this antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition can only take place in the thermodynamic limit ; hence we resort to finite size scaling techniques to calculate the disorder strength at which af lro is lost . in the case of bond disorder",
    ", these questions have been investigated previously with the dqmc method since there is no sign problem .",
    "@xcite we re - address these questions here in order to benchmark the accuracy of the cpqmc method .",
    "after the results for bond disorder are discussed , we consider the case of random site energies and its ability to drive the model from an antiferromagnet to a paramagnet .",
    "we again point out that the site disordered problem has not yet been studied with th qmc method because of the sign problem .",
    "the mechanism by which bond disorder destroys af lro is the formation of spin-0 singlets .",

    "for this value of the interaction strength , no amount of site disorder destroys the order in the hartree - fock approach , so this emphasizes the need for better treatment of correlations that techniques like the quantum monte carlo method provide . in general , we find that uhf calculations grossly overestimate the tendency for magnetic order when compared to the cpqmc calculations , as might be expected by an approach which ignores fluctuations .",
    "there is less significant disagreement between uhf and cpqmc techniques for the transport properties . unlike the 3d case",
    ", the uhf treatment finds that the 2d hubbard model is insulating for all values of interaction and disorder at half - filling : the inverse participation ratio was always nonzero .",
    "this is consistent with recent qmc calculations in two dimensions.@xcite a further difference between the 2d and 3d uhf results is our conclusion that the spin - glass phase is absent in two dimensions at half - filling .",

    "we found that , as is the case for clean systems , the cpqmc technique can provide an accurate way of treating the hubbard model . in particular , it gives the same critical disorder strength as the dqmc method in the case when dqmc has no sign problem ( bond randomness ) , which provides some confidence in applying it to cases such as site - disordered problems where the dqmc method can not give reliable results .",
    "much of the initial theoretical evidence for , and understanding of , questions of charge ordering in hubbard - like models has come from uhf treatments.@xcite recent work with techniques such as the density matrix renormalization group have emphasized that stripe formation is a subtle and delicate effect.@xcite our work indicates that there are significant corrections to the spin correlations within uhf treatments , and that further cpqmc calculations hold promise to shed some light on the behavior of disordered and interacting electron systems .",

    "we describe some tests of the cpqmc algorithm with a specific focus on the effect of the trial wave functions on the results .",
    "previously , the cpqmc algorithm has been extensively tested for interacting systems with no disorder .",
    "investigations have been performed on the single - band hubbard model in regions of parameter space where a severe sign problem is known to exist .",
    "@xcite the method has also been used to the study superconductivity in the 2d hubbard model by looking for long - range pairing correlations in the ground state@xcite and for ferromagnetism in the periodic anderson model.@xcite here disorder has been considered within a cpqmc calculation .",
    "cpqmc is an exact algorithm , for all observables , in the absence of interactions , even when disorder is turned on . as a check of our code",
    ", we therefore first verified that the cpqmc code reproduced results from exact diagonalization ( ed ) at different disorder strengths .",
    "likewise , the dqmc algorithm agrees perfectly with ed results.@xcite    we next looked in detail at the behavior of the magnetic structure factor as a function of disorder and interaction strengths , and as a function of the trial wave function . in the following discussion it is useful to distinguish between the value of the interaction strength , @xmath130 , used in the cpqmc algorithm , the value of the interaction strength , @xmath156 , used in the trial wave function , and the physical value of @xmath12 in the hamiltonian .",
    "we concentrate here on the case where @xmath3 and @xmath20 . in our dqmc simulations , which we used to provide benchmarks for the cpqmc method",
    ", we of course always choose @xmath157 since the dqmc treatment is exact.@xcite    the key result of our studies is that the cpqmc technique with uhf trial wave functions significantly overestimates the magnetic correlations if @xmath158 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scale - clean ] , which shows the ratio of the cpqmc to dqmc structure factors for the clean system on a @xmath129 lattice as a function of @xmath159 .",
    "the results are independent of the value of @xmath156 as long as @xmath160 .",
    "the structure factor is the same for the two methods when @xmath161 or @xmath162 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 lattices agreement is attained at @xmath163 and @xmath164 , respectively , for @xmath165 .",
    "a similar effect is seen when disorder is turned on , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scalesppsdis ] for site disorder . here",
    "we show the ratio of the cpqmc and dqmc structure factors as a function of @xmath159 for different lattice sizes .",
    "these results are for a single realization of disorder , which is kept fixed as @xmath130 and @xmath156 are varied .",
    "the values of the cpqmc structure factor for different @xmath156 fall onto two curves : for all @xmath166 , the cpqmc method gives the same significantly overestimated structure factor .",
    "meanwhile , for all @xmath167 , the cpqmc methods gives the same significantly underestimated structure factor .",
    "these different behaviors are a direct manifestation of the trial wave functions . in the unrestricted hartree - fock calculation ,",
    "both @xmath156 and @xmath18 act as one - body potentials and compete with each other : when @xmath167 , @xmath18 dominates and double occupancy is allowed , i.e. , the system is more free - electron like ; when @xmath166 , @xmath156 dominates , double occupancy is discouraged , and the system prefers to be in an af state .",
    "clearly , the cpqmc technique could not adequately eliminate the biases that the two different classes of uhf trial wave functions introduce through the approximate constraint to bring quantitative agreement between the two sets of results .",
    "in all the work reported in the body of this paper we chose @xmath166 so that the trial wave function had long - range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the destruction of order as randomness increased therefore must occur from correlation effects and not from any transition in the trial wave function .",
    "bond disorder is studied in fig .  [",
    "fig : scalesppbdis ] .",
    "the cpqmc structure factor is again overestimated .",
    "bond disorder @xmath19 , however , does not turn into one - body potentials in the uhf method in a simple manner , and unlike site disorder , there are not two separate behaviors .",
    "the result is rather independent of @xmath156.@xcite      while we show results for single disorder realizations in figs .",
    "[ fig : scalesppsdis ] and [ fig : scalesppbdis ] , the values of the renormalized couplings used in determining , for example , the critical disorder strength , in the main text of this paper were obtained with disorder averaging .",
    "the overestimation of the structure factor is a significant concern in our studies of the destruction of long - range antiferromagnetic order , which rely primarily on this quantity .",
    "it exemplifies the difficulty that faces all approximate methods to deal with the sign problem that use a trial wave function to constrain the qmc sampling , namely the results can be biased by the trial wave function , sometimes significantly .",
    "our approach is to fix @xmath130 at a `` renormalized '' value so that the structure factor from the cpqmc algorithm matches the dqmc result .",
    "this sort of tuning of the interaction strength has previously been done in comparisons of diagrammatic calculations for the hubbard model with dqmc results.@xcite a crucial question , of course , is whether the renormalized @xmath130 is independent of lattice size .",
    "we found that @xmath130 depends only weakly on lattice size for @xmath168 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : scalesppbdis ] . again",
    ", similar effects are known in the comparisons of dqmc and diagrammatic calculations.@xcite    a further indication of the importance of the renormalization of the interaction lies in the behavior of the staggered magnetization per site .",
    "data using a renormalized @xmath130 always lie below the classical upper limit of @xmath169 whereas simulations for fixed @xmath158 did not . at @xmath170 ,",
    "our result with a renormalized @xmath130 and @xmath171 was @xmath172 .",
    "this clean system value compares well to earlier results for the quantum heisenberg model obtained from a qmc calculation , @xmath173 ,  @xcite and from perturbation series expansions , @xmath174 .",
    "@xcite    another crucial question is whether the renormalized @xmath130 depends on disorder strength .",
    "this question can be addressed in the case of bond disorder where dqmc simulations of large lattices at low @xmath175 can be done without encountering the sign problem , but can not be done for site disorder .",
    "we found that for a given lattice size a single constant choice of @xmath130 could be used for all @xmath19.@xcite we note that the apparent variation of the renormalization on the values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 evident in comparing figs .",
    "1214 is dominantly due to the fact the data presented there are not disorder averaged , a particularly important issue for the smaller @xmath129 lattices .",
    "when such averaging is done , as in the main body of this paper , the variation is very significantly reduced .",
    "this is fortunate , since the tuning of @xmath130 for different disorder strength would be not only awkward but would also call into question whether transitions we observe as a function of disorder strength were caused by the tuning or by the randomness itself .",
    "we have focused here on the behavior of the structure factor and matching the dqmc and cpqmc values .",
    "previous work has shown that the energy and other correlations agree well.@xcite we have verified that the energy in dqmc and cpqmc techniques remains in relatively good agreement in these disordered systems if the trivial difference in interaction energy is accounted for by defining , @xmath176 comparisons of the energy in cpqmc and dqmc techniques behave as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaleerndis ] . for the parameters used in our simulations ,",
    "the energies disagree by at most 5% .",
