    "the two - point correlation coefficient of high redshift ( @xmath4 ) galaxies is quite similar to that of galaxies today ( e.g. steidel et  al .",
    "1996 , 2000 , giavalisco et  al .",
    "topology _ of the distribution of high redshift galaxies , however , is not yet clear .",
    "the two - point correlation coefficient alone is not very sensitive to this topology . in the local universe ,",
    "a large fraction of galaxies lie in filaments and sheets , such as the great wall ( geller & huchra 1989 ) .",
    "these filaments may be several hundred mpc in length , and are separated by voids which can be tens of mpc across .",
    "our understanding of how and when filaments and voids were established depends on the geometry of the universe and biasing of galaxies ( e.g. white & frenk 1991 ; kauffmann , nusser , & steinmetz 1997 ; mo , mao , & white 1999 ) .",
    "mapping such large scale structure at high redshifts requires a careful balance of field of view ( to encompass the structures ) , redshift coverage ( to accept enough test objects in the structure while avoiding confusion by overlapping structures in distance ) , and photometric sensitivity ( to find enough test objects ) .",
    "photometric redshifts ( see hogg et  al .",
    "1998 for a review ) provide an efficient estimate of redshift for large imaging surveys , but they are not accurate enough to avoid confusion from multiple overlapping structures , and can not delineate the structures directly .",
    "bright qsos may be markers of dense regions ( ellingson , yee & green , 1991 ) , but are too sparse to provide multiple samples within individual structure elements .",
    "narrow - band imaging to find  emitting galaxies has many advantages as a technique for mapping the topology of the galaxy distribution at high redshifts .",
    "the technique picks out galaxies in a narrow - range of redshifts , so the two - dimensional distribution of their positions on the sky can be used to constrain the topology alone , without the need for expensive follow - up spectroscopy . at sufficiently low flux limits",
    "the space density of detectable emitters becomes comparable to that of lyman - break galaxies ( eg . hu & mcmahon 1996 ) . they should be dense tracers of large scale structure . with large - format prime - focus imagers ,",
    "it is relatively straightforward to survey very large volumes of the early universe .",
    "the fast beam required for large field coverage puts a lower limit the width of the narrow - band filter .",
    "typically this limits the line - of - sight depth covered in an exposure to be roughly equal to or greater than the width .",
    "a disadvantage of  searches is that the  emission from a galaxy is very hard to predict theoretically , due to the very high optical depth in this line , its dependency on metalicity and star formation rate , and the ease with which it can be obscured by dust .",
    "two studies find some evidence for filamentary structure in the distribution of  emitting galaxies on scales of around 5mpc ( campos et  al .",
    "1999 , mller & fynbo 2001 ) .",
    "other surveys have found evidence for clustering in  emitting galaxies , but not for filamentary structure ( steidel et  al .",

    "observations were made on the nights of 7 - 8 august , 1999 , in the johnson @xmath9  and cousins @xmath10  filters , and in a custom narrow - band interference filter ( nb ) centered at 4107with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 54 .",

    "the period of the pattern was approximately 160 pixels ( 120 ) in the readout direction on the ccd .",

    "the i - band dome flats however were not uniformly illuminated and an illumination correction was derived from highly smoothed twilight flats .",
    "the i - band images were defringed by combining all of the images with object rejection .",
    "the objects were rejected by making a mask using the sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) object images .",
    "the object mask images were convolved with a 20 pixel diameter top hat kernel to reject the low surface brightness tails of the objects .",
    "wide - field optical distortions were corrected using a standard astrometric solution for mosaic ii provided in iraf .",
    "final alignment of the images was performed by matching each image to approximately 2000 stars in the apm catalog .",
    "the alignment was good to 0.3 pixels ( 0.08 ) rms .    before combining the images we created bad pixel masks which included hot pixels bad columns and cosmic rays .",
    "cosmic rays were selected using the @xmath19 package in iraf ( rhoads 2000 ) .",
    "we found this package to work extremely well for finding individual cosmic rays , however we had difficulty balancing the parameters to eliminate the faint halos associated with the cosmic ray hits . to eliminate these we devised a filtering algorithm which calculated the tookey biweight statistic ( beers , flynn & gebhardt 1990 ) in a region around each cr and eliminated all points adjacent to the cr which were @xmath20 from the estimated background level .",
    "photometric calibration was performed using 56 stars in the landolt fields 90 , 92 , sa110 and 113 ( landolt 1992 ) .",

    "the distribution of our candidate resolved  emitting sources is shown in fig  [ fig : lya positions ] . there is no obvious overdensity surrounding the previously known cluster at the field center . instead ,",
    "most of the candidates lie in a broad band extending from the north - east of the field to the south .",
    "there is a significant is the lack of galaxies in the north and west .",
    "these regions have long integration times .",
    "there are three close pairs or triplets of candidates , but otherwise the candidates are well spaced .",
    "the pairs have a spacing of about 20 arcsec or a minimum separation of 200 proper kpc .",
    "the spacing of the galaxies in the triplet is about 50 arcsec or a minimum separation of 440 proper kpc .",
    "we used two statistics to compare our data to a random distribution .",
    "we compare these statistics to results from monte carlo simulations generated with the same exposure - time mask . in this section",
    "we show that the distribution of our candidates has a significant excess of close ( @xmath55 ) pairs , and of large ( 6   8) voids .",
    "the first statistic is essentially the angular two - point correlation function . for a series of angular separations ,",
    "we take each data point in turn and count the number of other data points within that angular radius .",
    "the second statistic is a two - dimensional analogue of the void probability function ( vpf ) . for each angular scale",
    ", we randomly place 1000 circles with that radius on our field , so that the circles do not extend beyond the edge of our data .",
    "we count the fraction of these circles which did not contain any data points .",
    "the requirement that the circles not extend beyond the edge of the data makes this statistic most sensitive to voids near the center of the field .",
    "void probability functions are sensitive to structures such as voids and filaments , to which the two - point correlation function is relatively insensitive .    our data were compared to random monte carlo simulations generated as follows . at each location in our image ,",
    "the total exposure time was calculated .",
    "using these total exposure times , the relative flux limits in every part of our field were computed .",
    "the number / magnitude distribution of our brighter candidates can be reasonably approximated as a power - law , with the number per unit magnitude increasing by a factor of roughly 5 . combining this number - magnitude relation with the flux limits",
    ", we calculated the relative probability of finding a candidate per unit area in any given part of our image .",
    "we then used this relative probability map to generate 2000 fake data sets , each containing the same number of sources as in the real data .",
    "our data have a significant excess of galaxies with separations less than 1 .",
    "only 0.1% of the monte carlo simulations produced this many close galaxies .",
    "on larger scales , our data still show an excess of galaxies , but this is no longer significant at the 5% level .",
    "the void probability function ( fig  [ fig : vpf ] ) is more interesting .",
    "there is a clear excess of voids on scales of 5 arcminutes or greater . on scales of 5   8",
    ", this excess is significant at the 99.9% confidence level ( ie . fewer than 0.1% of our randomly generated data sets had vpfs as large as our data ) .",
    "we conclude that there is a significant excess of voids , and of small scale clustering , in our data .",
    "this conclusion is insensitive to the details of how we generated the random data sets : changes in ( for example ) the assumed number / magnitude relation made little difference to our results .",
    "the distribution of our  candidates is thus inconsistent with a random distribution , with 99.5% confidence .",
    "assuming that they are indeed galaxies at redshift 2.38 , is their distribution consistent with theoretical predictions ?",
    "in this section , we show that while the two - point correlation coefficient of our galaxy candidates is quite consistent with the predictions of a @xmath3cdm simulation , the distribution of our candidates shows more voids on 6   8  scales , with 97% confidence .",
    "to evaluate the apparent excess of voids , we compared our measured distribution of galaxies against the @xmath3cdm n - body simulations performed by the virgo consortium ( kauffmann et  al .",
    "we used their galaxy catalog , generated for redshift 2.12 . for each galaxy , they list its position , stellar mass , gaseous mass and star formation rate .",
    "mock catalogs were generated as follows .",
    "our observations were targeted at the source b1 , a probable pair of giant elliptical galaxies surrounded by an extensive neutral hydrogen cloud ( francis et  al .",
    "b1 has an estimated stellar mass of @xmath56 and gaseous mass of @xmath57 .",
    "we picked five galaxies in the @xmath3cdm simulations that had stellar and gaseous masses at least this large , and which lay far enough from the edge of the simulation volume .",
    "the regions around these `` b1-analogue '' galaxies should be good matches to our data . for comparison , we also picked eight random locations within the @xmath3cdm simulation volume .",
    "we then extracted the galaxies that lay within a volume 70@xmath070@xmath046 co - moving mpc ( for our adopted cosmology ) centered at each of these locations .",
    "there were @xmath58 ( 1 @xmath21 ) galaxies in their catalogs in each of these volumes .",
    "we then had to sparsely sample the galaxies within each of these volumes to generate mock catalogs with ( a ) 37 galaxies , and ( b ) a probability of being detected consistent with our exposure - time map .",
    "we did this in three different ways .    1 .   randomly .",
    "as  emission can be generated in many ways ( by star formation , shocks , cooling flows , agn etc ) , and its escape in measurable quantities depends on accidents of the geometry and dust distribution inside galaxies , we first assumed that all the galaxies in the @xmath3cdm simulations had the same probability ( 37/180 @xmath59 20% ) of being detected by our survey .",
    "2 .   star formation rate .",
    "if the  flux is generated by star formation , only galaxies with star formation rates in excess of @xmath60 would have been detected .",
    "we therefore took only galaxies with star formation rates at least this large , and generated random sub - samples with the correct size and probability of detection as a function of position in our field .",
    "only 25% of the galaxies within the @xmath3cdm cubes had star formation rates this large .",
    "3 .   mass .",
    "we took only galaxies with masses greater than @xmath61 , once again picking random sub - samples of the appropriate size and with probabilities of detection scaling appropriately with exposure time in each part of our image .    for each data cube , and for each of these three sub - sampling techniques , we repeated the random sub - sampling 2000 times .",
    "we then calculated the angular two - point correlation function and the void probability function for each sub - sampling of each data cube , and compared our results with the observations .",
    "fig  [ fig : skyplot ] shows our data , and five of the mock @xmath3cdm data cubes ( centered on the five b1-analogue galaxies ) .",
    "the cubes shown have been randomly sub - sampled : those sampled on the basis of star formation rate or mass look very similar .",
    "fig  [ fig : vpf ] shows the average void probability function of the randomly sub - sampled data cubes ( centered on b1-analogue galaxies ) .",
    "the angular two - point correlation coefficient of our data , and of the @xmath3cdm simulations are in excellent agreement . as fig  [ fig : vpf ] shows , however , the agreement is not as good for the void probability function .",
    "our data have a void probability function considerably higher than that of the simulations on large scales .",
    "is this difference significant ?",
    "the vpfs of our 13 simulated data cubes ( five centered on b1-analogue galaxies and eight randomly located ) actually showed rather little scatter , when averaged over all the 2000 random sub - samplings of each .",
    "the dominant source of scatter was the selection of the 37 galaxies in each simulated volume , which was typically twice as large .",
    "our uncertainty is thus dominated by the small sample size rather than by cosmic variance .    if we take the five data cubes centered on b1-analogues , and generate 2000 random sub - samplings of each , fewer that 0.1% of all these random sub - samplings have void probability functions as large as we observe on scales of 5   8 .",
    "if we sub - sample on the basis of star formation rate or galaxy mass , this fraction rises to around 1% .",
    "we would expect this , as more massive galaxies , and those with larger star formation rates , are expected to be more strongly biased .",
    "if we repeat these calculations for the randomly centered data cubes , the void probability function also rises slightly .",
    "this is presumably because centering our data cube on a b1 analogue precludes the possibility of a void in the center of the field .",
    "thus the observed distribution of galaxies has an excess of voids over the @xmath3cdm simulations , significant at roughly the 99% level .",
    "a qualitative impression of this can be gained from fig  [ fig : skyplot ] .",
    "while all the @xmath3cdm simulations show empty regions near the edge of the field , this is an artifact of the shorter exposure times in these regions .",
    "the simulations do not show large voids in the central @xmath62 arcminutes . due to the restriction that we only place voids",
    "so that they do not overlap the edges of our field , our vpf statistic is mostly sensitive to the distribution of galaxies in this central region .",
    "we thus have tentative evidence from our survey of larger voids in the galaxy distribution at redshift 2.38 than predicted by one particular @xmath3cdm simulation . with only 97% confidence , a sample size of 34 and no spectral confirmation for most of our candidate galaxies",
    ", this evidence must be regarded as tentative at best .",
    "but if it is confirmed by larger samples , what is it telling us ?",
    "steidel et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) did not see voids , but they covered too small a region on the sky to be sensitive to the scales of void we are detecting .",
    "ouchi et  al . ( 2003 ) imaged a region @xmath63% the size of ours , searching for  candidates at @xmath64 .",
    "voids can be seen in their data if only brightest objects are selected so that their number per unit area matches ours .",
    "voids might also explain the enormous field - to - field variance in the space density of  sources found by pascarelle , windhorst & keel ( 1998 ) .",
    "the spiky distribution of the redshifts of lyman - dropout galaxies seen by steidel et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) and adelberger et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) would also be consistent with large voids in the high redshift galaxy distribution .",
    "if the distribution of galaxies really contains more 10 co - moving mpc scale voids than predicted , either @xmath3cdm is predicting too uniform a distribution of galaxies , or the voids contain dark matter halos which for some reason do not contain detectable galaxies .",
    "there is some evidence for the latter hypothesis .",
    "the sight - line to background qso 2138@xmath654427 passes through one of the voids in our data , but the qso spectrum shows a metal enriched damped  absorption - system at our redshift ( francis & hewett 1993 , francis , wilson & woodgate 2001 ) .",
    "so there is clearly at least one dense concentration of gas and some stars within one of our voids .",
    "some high redshift galaxy clusters contain extended  emission nebulae , or `` blobs '' ( steidel et  al .",
    "the blobs are radio quiet ( @xmath66jy at 1.4 ghz ) , but otherwise share morphological similarity with the nebulae around radio galaxies ( e.g. kurk et  al .",
    "blobs are large , bright gas clouds ( @xmath67  kpc , @xmath68 ;  flux up to @xmath69 erg @xmath31 s@xmath7 ) .",
    "they appear to be common in regions of significant galaxy overdensity ( @xmath70  times that of the field ) at high redshift .",
    "most blobs are associated with a host galaxy , though not symmetrically centered on it .",
    "blobs may break into smaller knots of  and continuum emission , with velocity differences @xmath71 ( steidel et  al . 2000 ) .",
    "blobs can be among the brightest high-@xmath72 sub - mm sources ( chapman et  al .",
    "some blobs ( francis et  al . 2001 ) show civ emission ( and may host agn ) but others do not .",
    "we detect four  blobs in the narrow - band image .",
    "one of these , `` b1 '' , has previously been detected ( francis et  al .",
    "2001 ) . figure [ fig : blob images ]  shows the broad- and narrow - band images of each blob , together with the continuum subtracted emission - line image .",
    "each blob conforms to the expected size and brightness of this class of object .",

    "the excitation mechanism for the  emission is not known , but three primary models have been suggested :    in the early stages of a galaxy s formation , gas collapses into the dark matter potential well and cools via radiation ( e.g. fabian et  al . 1986 ) .",
    "haiman , spaans & quataert ( 2000 ) calculate that cooling flows ( with gas temperatures of a few @xmath80 k ) could produce the observed flux range , size , surface brightness profiles and number density observed from  blobs . while fardal et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) doubt that cooling flows would have sufficient luminosity , francis et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggest that shocks within the infalling gas can trigger the blob emission in the cooling flow .",
    "confirmation that the blobs are high redshift cooling flows would have profound implications for the interpretation of semianalytic galaxy formation models ( e.g. fall & efstathiou 1980 ) since we would be observing the initial collapse of gas into dark matter potential wells .    taniguchi et  al .",
    "( 2001 and references therein ) suggest that starburst - powered winds trigger  emission in the expelled gas .",
    "dust could obscure the host galaxy , with the  emission arising from a superwind extending @xmath81 kpc from the host .",
    "the dusty host galaxies would eventually evolve into ordinary elliptical galaxies , and the blobs would presumably dissipate into the intracluster medium .",
    "the scuba detections support this model , implying rapid star formation ( chapman et  al . 2001 ) and a probability of hosting an agn ( barger et  al .",
    "superwinds would indicate that the blobs are the next phase of galaxy evolution after the initial collapse .",
    "taniguchi & shioya ( 2000 ) estimate this phase would last only 0.1 gyr , occurring after the first 0.5 gyr of star formation .",
    "the expelled gas would eventually be stripped into the icm , though it would be metal - enriched having been processed by supernovae in the host galaxy .",
    "an agn may photo - ionize the gas , similar to radio galaxy nebulae and seyfert 2 galaxies with extended emission line regions ( e.g. villar - martin , tadhunter & clark 1997 ) .",
    "for example , a nebula has been found around the hdf - s qso which is radio - quiet ( bergeron et  al .",
    "1999 ; palunas et  al .",
    "for the blobs , we do not see a strong uv continuum source ; however , there may be an agn surrounded by an obscuring torus ( e.g. krolik & begelman 1986 ) .",
    "in fact , most of the chandra point sources do not show optical evidence for agn ( mushotzky et  al . 2000 ) .",
    "assuming an ionization parameter of 10 and a density of 1 @xmath82  at a distance of 10 kpc , a central source with luminosity @xmath83 ergs s@xmath7  is required to ionize a  blob with @xmath84  ergs s@xmath7 .",
    "the gas in agn - supported blobs would contribute to the icm , but with potentially lower metallicity than that from a starburst , thus diluting rather than enriching the icm .",
    "narrow - band imaging in the j2143 - 4423 region has revealed 34 candidate  emitters , including three new extended  blob candidates and five possible quasars .",
    "together with the previously reported emission - line galaxies and dla systems , these detections suggest this field is one of the most highly evolved structures detected at high redshift .",
    "the distribution of the candidates is non - random .",
    "there are more closely grouped galaxies , and more voids in the distribution , than would be expected from either a random distribution of galaxies or from the @xmath3cdm simulations of kauffmann et  al .",
    "this may indicate some environmental dependence on whether a galaxy emits detectable  emission .",
    "the detection of too many voids in our data is suggestive , but further observations with much more uniform sensitivity over much wider fields , combined with follow - up spectroscopy , will be required to definitively measure the topology of the distribution of high redshift galaxies .",
