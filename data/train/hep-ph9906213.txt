    "the abelian @xmath0-boson with the mass much larger than the @xmath3-boson mass ( @xmath4 ) is predicted by a number of extensions of the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particles @xcite . at the current energies",
    "@xmath5 the @xmath0 is decoupled .",
    "it can be described by the model based on the effective gauge group @xmath6 which is assumed to be a low energy remnant of some unknown underlying theory ( gut , for example ) .",
    "however , the @xmath0 would be light enough to give the first signal in future experiments .    due to the lower mass limit from the tevatron , @xmath7gev ,",
    "only the ` indirect ' @xmath0 manifestations caused by virtual heavy states can be searched for at the energies of the present day accelerators . in general , one is not able to estimate the magnitude of the @xmath0 signal because of the unknown couplings and the mass .",
    "however , numerous strategies to evidence manifestations of the @xmath0 in experiments at high energy @xmath8 and hadronic colliders have been developed .",
    "the analysis can be done with or without assumptions on the specific underlying theory containing the @xmath0 .",
    "hence , there are model dependent and model independent variables allowing to detect the @xmath0 .",
    "one of the model independent approaches useful in searching for the @xmath0 signal in the leptonic processes @xmath9 has been proposed in ref .",
    "the basic idea was to replace the standard observables , the total cross section @xmath10 and the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath11 , by the new set of variables defined as the differences of the cross sections integrated over suitable ranges of polar angle @xmath12 @xmath13 due to the sm values of the leptonic charges and the kinematic properties of the fermionic currents they have chosen the value @xmath14 to make the leading order deviations from the sm predictions @xmath15 dependent on the combinations @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 parameterize the vector and the axial - vector coupling of the @xmath0 to the fermion @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , assuming the lepton universality one obtains the sign definite observable @xmath20 .",
    "usually , the parameters describing at low energies the @xmath0 coupling to the sm fermions ( like @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) are assumed to be arbitrary numbers which must be fixed in experiments .",
    "however , this is not the case if the renormalizability of the underlying theory is taken into account . in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite it has been shown that , if one uses the principles of the renormalization group ( rg ) and the decoupling theorem the correlations between the parameters describing interactions of light particles with heavy virtual states of new physics beyond the sm , can be derived .",
    "most important that the relations obtained , being the consequence of the renormalizability formulated in the framework of scattering in the external field , are independent of the specific underlying ( gut ) model .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the method was applied to find signals of the heavy abelian @xmath0 in the four - fermion scattering processes .",
    "it was found that the renormalizability of the theory is resulted in the following constraints on the @xmath0 couplings to the sm fermions : @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the iso - partner of @xmath19 ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 stands for leptons ) , @xmath28 is the third component of the weak isospin and @xmath29 is the hypercharge parameterizing the @xmath0 coupling to the sm scalar doublet . since the parameters of various fermionic processes are appeared to be correlated , one could expect that it is possible to introduce the specific observables sensitive to the @xmath0 manifestations . in the present paper",
    "we propose such the observables which generalize the variables @xmath30 ( [ int:1 ] ) .",
    "the content is as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : nc ] the structure of neutral currents induced by the @xmath0-boson as well as the @xmath31-@xmath0 mixing is briefly discussed . employing the relations ( [ int:2 ] ) between the @xmath0 parameters",
    "the optimal observables for searching for signals of the heavy abelian @xmath0 are constructed in sect .",
    "[ sec : observ ] . in sect .",
    "[ sec : exp ] the experimental bounds on the observables are predicted .",
    "the obtained results are summarized in sect .",
    "[ sec : discuss ] .",
    "considering the interactions of the @xmath0 with the sm particles , one has to conclude that at low energies , @xmath32 , the renormalizable interactions are to be dominant .",
    "the terms of the non - renormalizable type ( for example , @xmath33 ) , being generated at gut ( or some intermediate @xmath34 ) mass scale , are suppressed by the factors @xmath35 , @xmath36 and can be neglected .",
    "thus , the interaction of the @xmath0 boson with the fermionic currents can be specified by the effective lagrangian @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the photon , the @xmath31- and @xmath0-bosons , respectively , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 stands for the @xmath42 coupling constant .",
    "@xmath43 denotes the sm value of the weinberg angle ( @xmath44 , where the charges @xmath45 correspond to the gauge groups @xmath46 , @xmath47 , respectively ) .",
    "the neutral currents can be parameterized as @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "the vector and the axial - vector couplings of the vector boson @xmath50 to the fermion @xmath19 are @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the fermion charge in the positron charge units .",
    "the constants @xmath55 and @xmath56 parameterize the vector and the axial - vector coupling of the fermion @xmath19 to the @xmath42 symmetry eigenstate , whereas @xmath57 is the mixing angle relating the mass eigen states @xmath58 to the massive neutral components of the @xmath59 and the @xmath42 gauge fields , respectively .",
    "its value can be determined from the relation @xcite @xmath60    because of the mixing between the @xmath31 and @xmath0 bosons the mass @xmath61 differs from the sm value @xmath62 by the small quantity of order @xmath63 @xcite @xmath64 and , as a consequence , the parameter @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , the mixing angle @xmath57 is also small @xmath66 .",
    "the difference @xmath67 is negative and completely determined by the @xmath0 coupling to the scalar doublet .",
    "thus , constraints on the @xmath0 interaction with the scalar field can be obtained by experimental detecting this observable : @xmath68    as it has been proven in ref.@xcite , the following relations hold for the constants @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath29 is the hypercharge parameterizing the coupling of the sm scalar doublet to the vector boson associated with the @xmath72 symmetry . as it is noted in sect . [",
    "sec : intr ] , the notation @xmath22 stands for the iso - partner of @xmath19 .",
    "in fact , the relation ( [ nc:5 ] ) means that the @xmath0 couplings to the sm axial currents have the universal absolute value , if a single light scalar doublet exists . among the four values @xmath55 ,",
    "@xmath56 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 parameterizing interaction of the @xmath0-boson with the @xmath75 fermionic isodoublet only one is independent .",
    "the rest ones can be expressed through it and the hypercharge @xmath29 of the @xmath0 coupling to the sm scalar doublet . if the hypercharges are treated as unknown parameters these relations are to be taken into account in order to preserve the gauge symmetry @xcite .",
    "the relations ( [ nc:5 ] ) also show that the fermion and the scalar sectors of the new physics are strongly connected . as a result ,",
    "the couplings of the @xmath0-boson to the sm axial currents are completely determined by its interaction with the scalar fields .",
    "therefore , one is able to predict the @xmath0 coupling to the sm axial currents by measuring the @xmath76 parameter .",
    "when the @xmath0 does not interact with the scalar doublet , the @xmath31-boson mass is to be identical to its sm value . in this case",
    "the @xmath0 couplings to the axial currents are produced by loops and to be suppressed by the additional small factor @xmath77 .",
    "in the present section we consider the electron - positron annihilation into fermion pairs @xmath78 for energies",
    "@xmath79gev . in this case",
    "all the fermions except for the @xmath80-quark can be treated as massless particles @xmath81 .",
    "the @xmath0-boson existence causes the deviations ( @xmath82 ) of the cross section from its sm value : @xmath83 }     { 32\\pi s}+o(\\frac{s^2}{m^4_{z^\\prime}}),\\ ] ] with @xmath84 where @xmath85 denotes the born amplitude of the process @xmath86 with the virtual @xmath87-boson ( @xmath88 ) state in the @xmath89-channel ( the corresponding diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath90 can be calculated in the form @xmath91 where @xmath92 for quarks and @xmath93 for leptons , @xmath94 denotes the fermion helicity states , @xmath95 , @xmath96 ( where @xmath12 is the angle between the incoming electron and the outgoing fermion ) , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 with @xmath99 when @xmath100 and @xmath101 otherwise .    to discuss the physical effects caused by the relation ( [ nc:5 ] ) , let us introduce the observable @xmath102 defined as the difference of cross sections integrated in suitable ranges of @xmath103 @xmath104 the value of @xmath31 will be chosen later . actually , this observable is the generalized @xmath105 of ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "the two conventionally used observables , the total cross section @xmath10 and the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath11 , can be obtained by special choice of @xmath31 ( @xmath107 , @xmath108 ) .",
    "in fact , one can express @xmath109 in terms of @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xmath110    owing to the relations ( [ nc:5 ] ) the quantity @xmath111 can be written in the form @xmath112 the functions @xmath113 depend on the fermion type through the @xmath114 , only . in figs .",
    "[ fig:2]-[fig:4 ] they are shown as the functions of @xmath31 for @xmath115gev .",
    "the leading contributions to @xmath113 @xmath116 are given by the @xmath0 exchange diagram ( the first term of eq.([obs:4 ] ) ) , since the contribution of the @xmath31 exchange diagram to @xmath117 ( the second term of eq.([obs:4 ] ) ) is suppressed by the factor @xmath118 .",
    "from the eqs .",
    "( [ obs:7 ] ) one can see that the leading contributions to the leptonic factors @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 are found to be proportional to the same polynomial in @xmath31 .",
    "this is the characteristic feature of the leptonic functions @xmath122 originated due to the kinematic properties of fermionic currents and the specific values of the sm leptonic charges .",
    "therefore , it is possible to choose the value of @xmath123 which switches off three leptonic factors @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 simultaneously . moreover , the quark function @xmath124 in lower order is proportional to the leptonic one and therefore is switched off , too . as is seen from figs .",
    "[ fig:2]-[fig:4 ] , the appropriate value of @xmath125 is about @xmath126 . by choosing this value of @xmath125",
    "one can simplify eq.([obs:6 ] ) .",
    "it is also follows from eq .",
    "( [ obs:6 ] ) that neglecting the factors @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 one obtains the sign definite quantity @xmath127 .    comparing the observable @xmath128 with @xmath129 or @xmath130 one can to conclude that the sign of the variables @xmath131 is completely undetermined in the case of arbitrary leptonic couplings @xmath132 .",
    "therefore , in order to predict the sign of the observables @xmath131 one has to assume the additional restriction such as the lepton universality .",
    "let the value of @xmath125 in eq.([obs:5 ] ) is determined from the relation @xmath133 the solution @xmath134 is shown in fig [ fig:5 ] .",
    "as is seen , @xmath125 decreases from 0.3170 at @xmath115gev to 0.3129 at @xmath135gev .",
    "table i demonstrates the corresponding behavior of the functions @xmath136 .",
    "since @xmath136 depend on the center - of - mass energy through the small quantity @xmath118 , the order of the shifts is about 3% .",
    "therefore , in what follows the value of @xmath137 is taken to be 500gev .",
    "assuming @xmath138 , one can derive @xmath139    hence it is seen , that the observable @xmath128 is negative .",
    "moreover , it can be written in terms of the @xmath76 parameter using eq.([nc:7 ] ) : @xmath140    one also can construct the sign definite observable for quarks of the same generation . as it follows from eq .",
    "( [ obs:9 ] ) , @xmath141 hence it follows , that the values of @xmath142 and @xmath143 in the @xmath144  @xmath143 plane have to be at the line crossing axes at the points @xmath145 and @xmath146 , respectively .",
    "it also follows from eq.([obs:10 ] ) that the observable @xmath147 is negative .",
    "thus , the dependencies ( [ int:2 ] ) between the @xmath0 couplings to sm fermions allows to construct three negative valued observables , @xmath127 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 , which are correlated by eqs .",
    "( [ obs:10])-([obs:13 ] ) .",
    "these observables are the most general model independent ones which can be introduced without any assumptions such as the lepton or quark universality .",
    "the present day experimental data constrain the magnitude of the four - fermion contact interactions allowing to derive bounds on the @xmath0 coupling to the axial currents and , consequently , on the observables introduced in the previous section .",
    "our analysis is based on the data presented in refs . @xcite where the study of the experimental bounds on the lepton - quark four - fermion contact couplings has been performed . in general ,",
    "the contributions of new physics beyond the sm to the considered therein processes ( the atomic parity violation experiment as well as the electron - nucleus , muon - nucleus and @xmath150-nucleon scattering experiments ) are described by 20 parameters , namely , @xmath151 where @xmath152 ; @xmath153 and @xmath94 . in order to reduce the number of independent @xmath154 one usually assumes the @xmath46 invariance and the lepton universality . as a result ,",
    "six variables ( for example , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 ) can be chosen as the basis .",
    "however , the number of independent @xmath154 can be further decreased by employing the correlations ( [ int:2 ] ) . in this case",
    "it is useful to introduce the couplings @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 parameterizing the four - fermion interactions between the left - handed and the axial - vector currents .",
    "these couplings are the linear combinations of the variables ( [ exp:1 ] ) : @xmath164 as it follows from eq .",
    "( [ int:2 ] ) , one has six independent parameters @xmath165 which can be used as the basis .",
    "the experiment constrains the specific linear combinations of the variables @xmath154 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . introducing the normalized couplings : @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the fermi constant",
    ", one can write down the experimental bounds as follows : @xmath168 eqs .",

    "they determine the allowed region in the space of @xmath173- parameters .    by employing eqs .",
    "( [ exp:1a ] ) , ( [ exp:2b])-([exp:2 g ] ) it is easy to obtain the bounds on the quantities ( [ exp:2 ] ) : @xmath174 the first of the relations ( [ exp:3 ] ) gives possibility to determine the allowed magnitude of the observables @xmath175 and @xmath176 @xmath177 thus , the signals of the abelian @xmath0 must respect the above relations if the low energy physics is described by the minimal sm .",
    "it is worth to compare the first of eqs .",
    "( [ exp:4 ] ) based on the analysis of the lepton - quark interactions with the direct constraints derived from the experiments on the @xmath178 scattering . introducing the normalized @xmath0 coupling to the axial leptonic",
    "current : @xmath179 one can write down the bounds obtained from the processes @xmath180 as follows @xmath181 ( see fig . 2.7 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . however , the relations ( [ exp:4 ] ) lead to the constraint @xmath182 .",
    "thus , the bounds ( [ exp:4 ] ) are about nine times stronger than ones derived from the analysis of the pure leptonic interactions .",
    "in the lack of reliable information on the model describing physics beyond the sm and predicting @xmath0 boson it is of great importance to find the model independent variables to search for this particle . in this regard , it could be useful to employ the method of ref .",
    "@xcite which gives possibility to reduce the number of unknown numbers parameterizing effects on new heavy virtual particles .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the observables @xmath183 alternative to the familiar @xmath10 and @xmath11 and perspective in searching for the abelian @xmath184 signal in the leptonic processes @xmath185 were proposed .",
    "it was pointed out that the sign of the @xmath186 deviation from the sm value can be uniquely predicted when the lepton universality is assumed .",
    "the sign remains to be unspecified in the case of an arbitrary interaction of @xmath0 with leptons .",
    "the observables introduced in the present paper are the extension of that in ref .",
    "@xcite with the specified above choice of the boundary angle .",
    "the observable @xmath175 is the negative defined quantity even in the case when the lepton universality is not assumed .",
    "moreover , the observable @xmath187 constructed for the quarks of the same generation is proportional to the leptonic one @xmath175 being negative , too .    as it was mentioned in section [ sec : observ ] ,",
    "the magnitude of the leptonic observable @xmath175 is determined by means of the @xmath76 parameter .",
    "thus , the @xmath184 contributions to the quantities @xmath188 , @xmath175 and @xmath187 have to be negative allowing to detect the @xmath184 signal .    as the corollary of our analysis",
    "we note that the introduced observables allow one to identify ( or to discard ) the abelian @xmath184 effects when the low energy physics is described by the minimal sm .",
    "therefore , they can usefully complement the conventional analysis of @xmath184 couplings based on the observables @xmath10 and @xmath11",
