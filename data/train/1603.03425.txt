    "quantum field theory is the mathematical language of nature . viewed in this light ,",
    "much of the last century of theoretical physics can be seen as quantum field theory calculations performed in a variety of approximations .",
    "the most fruitful scheme so far is clearly perturbation theory in small couplings , which has seen wide use and great success .",
    "nevertheless there are important physical situations where naive perturbation theory fails and must be enhanced by partial resummation if it can be used at all .",
    "for example , massless particles in thermal plasmas produce large loop corrections which must be resummed , causing thermal mass generation and non - analyticities in thermodynamic functions .",
    "similarly , large logarithms can invalidate naive perturbation theory in problems involving disparate length or energy scales .",
    "resummation of these logarithms leads to the renormalization group running of coupling constants .",
    "although the need to go beyond naive perturbation theory is clear in many cases , _ ad hoc _ resummations are problematic because perturbation series are asymptotic in nature @xcite .",
    "systematic resummation schemes are required to guarantee consistency with the original non - perturbative theory .",
    "there are three such schemes which can claim to be widely studied and successful : the renormalization group ( rg ) @xcite , large @xmath1 expansion @xcite , and @xmath2-particle irreducible effective actions ( @xmath2pieas ) @xcite .",
    "this work focuses on the latter .",
    "@xmath2pieas are a functional technique that combine the advantages ( and some disadvantages ) of perturbation theory and variational methods . based on a legendre transform procedure ,",
    "@xmath2pieas are guaranteed to be equivalent to the original theory and can capture analytic features of the exact theory that are invisible to perturbation theory , and so side - step potential issues with _ ad hoc _",
    "resummations @xcite . the 1piea , developed by goldstone , salam and weinberg @xcite and jona - lasinio @xcite , effects a resummation of tadpoles by defining an effective action functional @xmath3 $ ] which depends on the expectation value @xmath4 of the quantum field .",
    "the physical value of @xmath5 is determined by the variational equation of motion @xmath6 and , when this equation is satisfied , one can drop all one particle reducible diagrams from the diagrammatic perturbation expansion .",
    "the 2piea technique was originally developed by lee and yang @xcite , luttinger and ward @xcite , baym @xcite and others in the context of many - body theory , then extended by cornwall , jackiw and tomboulis @xcite to relativistic field theory in the functional formalism . in the 2piea formalism",
    "one defines an action functional @xmath7 $ ] depending not just on the mean field , but also its correlation function @xmath8 , and solves for @xmath9 using @xmath10 .",
    "this effects a resummation of all self - energy insertions and removes two particle reducible diagrams from the diagrammatic expansion .",
    "apparently de dominicis and martin @xcite were the first to realize that the @xmath11 and @xmath12 formalisms are special cases of a general construction giving higher order effective actions for @xmath13 .",
    "early work on higher effective actions was carried on by vasiliev @xcite , whose book was unfortunately not available in english for more than twenty years , though there were some reviews suggesting that the english literature was at least aware of these developments ( e.g. @xcite ) . the recent resurgence of interest in higher @xmath2pieas has largely been driven by their advantages for non - equilibrium problems and can likely be credited to the reviews by berges @xcite and advances in computer power .",
    "one of the disadvantages of @xmath2pieas is that finite order truncations of the effective actions generically do not respect the symmetry properties one expects from the exact theory .",
    "this is because the correlation functions of the 1piea obey different ward identities ( wis ) than the 2piea etc .",
    "this can also be understood in terms of the patterns of resummations effected by @xmath2pieas which , if truncated , do not preserve the order by order cancellations required to maintain all symmetries .",
    "similar remarks apply for global symmetries and gauge invariances . the most notable physical consequence of this is a violation of goldstone s theorem for theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking : would - be goldstone bosons gain an unphysical mass in the hartree - fock approximation , leading also to unphysical reaction thresholds and decay rates .",
    "more subtle effects appear in higher order approximations .",
    "similarly , in gauge theories a residual gauge dependence appears in quantities that should be physical .",
    "this work focuses on the particular scheme devised by pilaftsis and teresi @xcite for improving the symmetry properties of 2pieas .",
    "symmetry improvement enforces 1pi style wis on the 2piea by the use of lagrange multipliers .",
    "the resulting constraint forces the goldstone boson correlation functions to obey goldstone s theorem , giving physically correct massless goldstone bosons at all orders and even at finite temperatures below the critical temperature of the symmetry breaking phase transition .",
    "so far symmetry improvement has only been applied to non - gauged scalar field theories in equilibrium .",
    "it restores goldstone s theorem and produces physically reasonable absorptive parts in propagators @xcite and has been shown to restore the second order phase transition of the @xmath14 linear sigma model in the hartree - fock approximation @xcite .",
    "it has been used to study pion strings evolving in the thermal bath of a heavy ion collision @xcite ( though note that the symmetry improved 2piea was only used to calculate an equilibrium finite temperature effective potential ; this work did not constitute what we would call a true non - equilibrium calculation using symmetry improved effective actions ) .",
    "symmetry improvement has also been demonstrated to improve the evaluation of the effective potential of the standard model by taming the infrared divergences of the higgs sector , treated as an @xmath14 scalar field theory with gauge interactions turned off @xcite .",
    "the symmetry improvement idea can also be extended to 3pieas @xcite , which requires enforcing an additional set of wis for the three point vertex function and the fixing of an ambiguity in the constraint procedure . during review of this manuscript",
    "we became aware of the recent preprint @xcite which shows that symmetry improved 2pi equations of motion can lose solutions even in equilibrium as the result of a truncation artifact .",
    "this loss of solutions is distinct from the one we find below and shows that more work is required to understand the domain of applicability of symmetry improved effective actions .",
    "there is a strong motivation to extend symmetry improvement beyond equilibrium since one of the major reasons for using @xmath2pieas in the first place is their ability to handle non - equilibrium situations .",
    "@xmath2pieas give an entirely mechanical way to set up the generic initial value problem as a _ closed _ system of integro - differential equations directly for the mean fields and low order correlation functions , which are simply related to the handful of physical quantities ( densities , conserved currents , etc . )",
    "one is most often interested in .",
    "apart from a truncation to some finite loop order these equations need not be subject to any further approximation .",
    "hence , apart from the symmetry issue and issues involved in the renormalization process , @xmath2pieas give potentially the most general and accurate framework available for the computation of real time properties in quantum field theory .",
    "motivated by this , we seek to extend the symmetry improvement technique to non - equilibrium situations .",
    "the ultimate goal of this program would be a tractable and manifestly gauge invariant set of equations of motion for highly excited yang - mills - higgs theories with chiral fermion matter based on the self - consistently complete 4piea . in the meantime we content ourselves with an analysis of the symmetry improved 2piea for scalar fields in the linear response regime .",
    "we investigate the linear response approximation rather than a generic non - equilibrium situation for several reasons .",
    "first , the linear response approximation is simply far more tractable than the general non - equilibrium situation as the response functions only depend on the equilibrium properties of the theory .",
    "second , linear response is widely applicable in the real world : many systems are `` close enough '' to equilibrium for practical purposes .",
    "third , the linear response approximation is a nice laboratory to isolate the novel features of symmetry improvement constraints in non - equilibrium settings .",
    "indeed , we can find results that are independent of any truncation of the effective action .",
    "finally , we expect any physically reasonable formalism to give a well formed linear response approximation , though this depends on the assumption that the exact behavior is an analytic ( or at least not too singular ) function of the external perturbation within some neighborhood of zero perturbation .",
    "this is true of all quantum mechanical systems ( so long as the hamiltonian remains bounded below ) , but for field theories the infinite number of degrees of freedom may complicate the situation .",
    "the outline of the remainder of this work is as follows . in section [ sec : linear - response - theory ]",
    "we review linear response theory and 2pieas .",
    "then in section [ sec : symmetry - improvement ] we review the symmetry improvement method , re - deriving the wi constraints in the presence of external sources which were neglected in previous work . in section [ sec : implications - of - constraints ] we derive the consequences of the constraints for the linear response functions , noting that a careful treatment of the constraint procedure requires that not just the wi , but also its derivatives , must vanish . in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we reach our conclusions about the feasibility of symmetry improvement within the linear response approximation and sketch some ideas for future work . in appendix",
    "[ sec : the - alternate - constraint ] we discuss an alternative symmetry improvement procedure that relaxes the over - determining wis , but still leads to difficulties due to the necessity of the derivatives of the constraint to also vanish .",
    "finally , appendix [ sec : mechanical - analogy ] includes a mechanical analogy which illustrates some of the subtle points about the constraint procedure in a simpler setting .",
    "our conventions follow our previous paper @xcite . in particular @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "loop counting factors of @xmath17 will be kept .",
    "repeated indices are summed , and spacetime arguments going along with @xmath0 indices are implicitly integrated over ( `` dewitt notation '' ) . where explicitly written spacetime integrals are @xmath18 and momentum integrals are @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 $ ] represents the ( anti-)time ordered product of the factors in @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "it is not necessary here to distinguish between real time , matsubara and schwinger - keldysh time contours . for a physical quantity @xmath22",
    "we denote its equilibrium value by @xmath23 and its shift under linear response by @xmath24 so that @xmath25 plus higher order terms .",
    "linear response theory studies the effect of small externally applied perturbations on a system initially in equilibrium .",
    "consider a quantum system which is subjected to an external driving potential @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a c - number function of time representing the strength of the driving and @xmath28 is the interaction hamiltonian ( the reason for the name will become apparent ) .",
    "if the initial state of the system is described by a density matrix @xmath29 at time @xmath30 , with @xmath31 for @xmath32 , then at time @xmath33 the expectation of an operator @xmath34 ( in the interaction picture with respect to the external perturbation ) is : @xmath35\\rho_{0 } \\right .",

    "this leads us to define the response function @xmath37\\right\\rangle \\theta\\left(t-\\tau\\right)$ ] ( which only depends on the time difference due to the equilibrium assumption about @xmath29 ) such that @xmath38 ( the limits can be pushed to @xmath39 thanks to the step function in @xmath40 , and the equation becomes trivial in the fourier domain . )",
    "the goal of linear response theory is to compute @xmath41 for perturbations @xmath42 and observables @xmath34 of interest .",
    "the condition for validity of the approximation is that the quadratic term , which is @xmath43,\\hat{b}\\left(\\tau_{2}\\right)\\right]\\right\\rangle \\mathrm{d}\\tau_{2}\\mathrm{d}\\tau_{1},\\ ] ] is much smaller than the linear term , which occurs for sufficiently small sources @xmath44 and times @xmath45 .",
    "we now specialize to the scalar @xmath0 field theory defined by the action @xmath46=\\int_{x}\\mathcal{l}\\left[\\phi\\right]=\\int_{x}\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi_{a}\\partial^{\\mu}\\phi_{a}-\\frac{1}{2}m^{2}\\phi_{a}\\phi_{a}-\\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\left(\\phi_{a}\\phi_{a}\\right)^{2},\\ ] ] where @xmath47 and we choose to operate in the spontaneous symmetry breaking regime with @xmath48 .",
    "the vacuum expectation value @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 and the tree level mass of the radial ( `` higgs '' ) mode is @xmath51 .",
    "we take the vacuum expectation value to be in the last component @xmath52 .",
    "the symmetry transformation is @xmath53 where @xmath54 with @xmath55 are the generators of rotations .",
    "when we have cause to use specific generators we will write @xmath56 with @xmath57 in @xmath58 to denote the plane of rotation , and have @xmath59 .",
    "considering this theory in a particle physics context , the most likely external perturbations will be linear or quadratic in the fields .",
    "for example , we could be using this theory to describe mesons coupling to hadrons through yukawa interactions @xmath60 , or higgs fields coupling to a yang - mills sector through ( possibly some subset of ) the conserved currents with terms like @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the theory can also represent an extended higgs or dark matter sector coupled via portal terms to the standard model higgs with @xmath63 , or coupled to a standard model singlet scalar sector @xmath64 through @xmath65 .",
    "finally the fields could represent a multi - field inflaton , moduli or an extended gravitational sector , all of whose interactions to the standard model sector will be mediated by terms of the preceding forms to leading order in an effective field theory expansion .",
    "thus , on very general grounds we expect that the external perturbation can be taken as a linear or quadratic function of the fields .",
    "the only notable exception is the coupling of the field theory to gravity , which includes the quartic interaction @xmath66 .",
    "we now consider the notable observables in the theory .",
    "chiefly we will be interested in the field expectation values @xmath67 , the conserved @xmath0 currents @xmath68 and the energy - momentum tensor @xmath69 again we see that , apart from the @xmath70 term in the energy , the observables are also linear or quadratic in the fields .",
    "note that if desired @xmath71 can be approximated in a mean field approximation by terms of the form @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 plus corrections that can be found diagrammatically .",
    "this means that many of the local quantities one might want can be determined by a method yielding @xmath67 and @xmath75\\right\\rangle -\\varphi_{a}\\varphi_{b}$ ] subject to generic quadratic perturbations of the form @xmath76 .",
    "this problem seems tailor made for the 2piea .",

    "the _ hartree - fock _ approximation is obtained by retaining only the @xmath92 term in @xmath93 .",

    "we make the spontaneous symmetry breaking ansatz @xmath94 where @xmath95 are the goldstone / higgs propagators respectively .",
    "we define the masses @xmath96 from the corresponding exact propagators .",
    "the free propagator is @xmath97 so that @xmath98 and @xmath99 to lowest order .",
    "however , truncations of the vev equation of motion @xmath100 _ do not _ generically obey @xmath101 so that @xmath102 .",
    "symmetry improvement replaces the vev equation of motion by the constraint @xmath103 so that goldstone s theorem is exactly satisfied whenever @xmath104 .",
    "the value of @xmath49 is then determined by the self - consistent solution of ( [ eq : dyson - eq ] ) .    to connect this formalism to linear response theory we must expand @xmath105 and @xmath106 about their source - free equilibrium values @xmath107 and @xmath108 in ( [ eq : unmodified - vev - eom])-([eq : unmodified - delta - eom ] ) and match terms order by order in the sources , treating the responses @xmath109 and @xmath110 as first order , as typical of a perturbation theory analysis .",
    "at lowest order we find ( [ eq : unmodified - vev - eom])-([eq : unmodified - delta - eom ] ) with no sources for the equilibrium solutions and at first order we find @xmath111 where all derivatives on the left hand sides are evaluated at the equilibrium values .",
    "it is possible to eliminate the fluctuations from these equations by introducing the linear response functions @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 : @xmath116 and demanding that the resulting equations hold for any value of the sources @xmath44 , @xmath117 . doing",
    "this leads to the system @xmath118 where note that in the last two equations we have to symmetrize the right hand sides before removing the source @xmath117 ( since by the symmetry of @xmath117 only the symmetric part contributes ) .",
    "these equations determine the linear response functions entirely in terms of the equilibrium properties of the theory ( in particular , the second derivatives of the effective action evaluated at the equilibrium solution ) .",
    "note that the last equation can be recast as a bethe - salpeter equation for the @xmath119 by using ( [ eq:2piea ] ) and ( [ eq : dyson - eq ] ) to write the left hand side of ( [ eq : unmodified - delta - eom ] ) as    @xmath120-\\sigma_{ab}\\left[\\varphi,\\delta\\right ]   & = -\\delta_{ab}^{-1}+\\left(\\delta_{0ab}^{-1}\\left[\\varphi\\right]-\\delta_{0ab}^{-1}\\left[\\tilde{\\varphi}\\right]\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\      & + \\left(\\delta_{0ab}^{-1}\\left[\\tilde{\\varphi}\\right]-\\sigma_{ab}\\left[\\tilde{\\varphi},\\tilde{\\delta}\\right]\\right)+\\left(\\sigma_{ab}\\left[\\tilde{\\varphi},\\tilde{\\delta}\\right]-\\sigma_{ab}\\left[\\varphi,\\delta\\right]\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\      & = -\\delta\\delta_{ab}^{-1}+\\frac{\\delta\\delta_{0ab}^{-1}}{\\delta\\varphi_{c}}\\delta\\varphi_{c}-\\left(\\frac{\\delta\\sigma_{ab}}{\\delta\\varphi_{c}}\\delta\\varphi_{c}+\\frac{\\delta\\sigma_{ab}}{\\delta\\delta_{cd}}\\delta\\delta_{cd}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    then using the identity @xmath121 and the definitions of the linear response functions followed by some rearrangement to give @xmath122 this is an equation which determines the four point kernel @xmath119 iteratively , i.e. a bethe - salpeter equation with the last quantity in braces being the bethe - salpeter kernel .",
    "while this is the general formalism connecting effective actions to linear response theory , we do not need to use it because symmetry improvement constraints change the picture significantly .",
    "in particular , we can derive the implications of the constraints for linear response theory without explicitly computing any equilibrium solutions , taking any derivatives of the effective action , performing any truncation of the self - energies , or worrying about renormalization of the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "our results are independent of all of these details .",
    "here we review the symmetry improvement procedure since the derivation of the constraint and the limiting procedure are affected by the presence of sources .",

    "we take a field derivative then apply the equations of motion , giving @xmath127 which holds for all rotations @xmath128 so we define @xmath129 the symmetry improvement program then interprets the @xmath123 as the _ 2pi _ propagator .",
    "one could also motivate the replacement @xmath130 based on the form of the right hand side of ( [ eq : unmodified - vev - eom ] ) .",
    "we do not make this replacement . the only affect at the linear response level would be to renormalize @xmath131 in our results below which , since @xmath79 are freely chosen functions , gives no new physics .    to enforce the wi",
    "we add a lagrange multiplier term to the 2piea @xmath132 with @xmath133 where @xmath134 are the lagrange multiplier fields . in the previous paper @xcite",
    "we included a transverse projector @xmath135 : @xmath136 to ensure that only goldstone modes are involved in the constraint .",
    "this turns out to make no difference in equilibrium .",
    "however , this constraint gives a different scheme beyond the equilibrium approximation .",
    "( note that pilaftsis and teresi @xcite did not write the constraint in an @xmath0 covariant form , hence both of the above are valid generalizations of their procedure . ) using @xmath137 instead of @xmath138 merely seems to shuffle around the pathologies we derive below rather than remove them .",
    "we shall henceforth use @xmath138 since dropping the projector greatly simplifies the following algebra . see appendix [ sec : the - alternate - constraint ] for discussion of the scheme using @xmath137 .",
    "the equations of motion following from the symmetry improved effective action are    @xmath139    where the last equation simplifies to @xmath140 on using the identity @xmath141 .",
    "we now recall what happens to the right hand sides of these equations in equilibrium with @xmath142 ( this is reviewing @xcite ) .",
    "the only non - trivial wis are @xmath143 , so that the constraint enforces @xmath103 , i.e. the goldstone mass vanishes if @xmath104 as expected . using homogeneity @xmath144 , and equations ( [ eq : eq - ssb - ansatz - vev])-([eq : eq - ssb - ansatz - delta ] )",
    "the other equations of motion become @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the volume of spacetime .",

    "we can consistently set @xmath149 and all other components of @xmath134 to zero .",
    "thus the constraint is a singular one .",
    "we regulate the divergence by setting @xmath150 and take the limit @xmath151 such that @xmath152 is a constant .",
    "this gives @xmath153 thus the propagator equations of motion are unmodified and the vev equation is modified by the presence of a homogeneous force that acts to push @xmath49 away from the minimum of the effective potential to the point where @xmath154 .",
    "in the linear response approximation @xmath79 and @xmath82 no longer vanish , and we must solve equations ( [ eq : wi ] ) , ( [ eq : si - eom - vev ] ) and ( [ eq : si - eom - delta ] ) to first order in the sources without any assumption of homogeneity . to do this",
    "we expand all quantities @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath155 and match terms order by order , considering the @xmath109 etc . as first order .",
    "working first on ( [ eq : wi ] ) gives the pair of equations : @xmath156 the first equation is simply the equilibrium constraint as expected since the analysis of the last section holds with all quantities decorated with tildes .",
    "the second equation is new . using the identity ( [ eq : variation - of - inverse - delta ] ) gives to first order @xmath157 the first term vanishes by virtue of ( [ eq : wi - zeroth - order ] ) , thus @xmath158 the nature of this equation is remarkable .",

    "gives : @xmath159 the desired linear response functions are then just the green functions for these equations , i.e. @xmath160 etc .",
    "there are two major flaws with these equations .",
    "the first is a physical misprediction : @xmath161 propagates masslessly due to the equilibrium goldstone propagator even though the higgs propagator has a non - zero mass .",
    "the second is that @xmath162 is overdetermined , i.e. its initial value problem is ill posed . in the fourier domain equations ( [ eq : phig - eom - w - higgs - propagator ] ) and ( [ eq : phig - eom - w - goldstone - propagator ] )",
    "read @xmath163 which obviously only allows solutions if there are modes satisfying @xmath164 and if @xmath165 is only supported on these modes . if any other perturbation is applied or a solution of @xmath164 does not exist the system is inconsistent .",
    "this is clearly not the expected behavior physically",
    ". one can relax ( [ eq : phig - eom - w - higgs - propagator ] ) by using the projected constraint ( [ eq : projected - constraint ] ) instead of ( [ eq : simple - constraint ] ) , however this leads to further difficulties as discussed in appendix [ sec : the - alternate - constraint ] .",
    "there is further danger lurking in the right hand sides of equations ( [ eq : si - eom - vev ] ) and ( [ eq : si - eom - delta ] ) .",
    "since the constraint procedure involves a limit @xmath166 there is a danger that terms on the right hand sides can diverge .",
    "consider the expansion of the right hand side of ( [ eq : si - eom - vev ] ) to first order : @xmath167 using ( [ eq : lagrange - multipliers ] ) the term proportional to @xmath168 can be written @xmath169 which , for the @xmath170 limit to exist , requires that the term in braces vanishes , i.e. @xmath171 a similar analysis for ( [ eq : si - eom - delta ] ) gives @xmath172 we call ( [ eq : secondary - constraint - phi - eom ] ) and ( [ eq : secondary - constraint - delta - eom ] ) the _ secondary _ constraints of the scheme and , by contrast , equation ( [ eq : wi - first - order ] ) the _ primary _ constraint .",
    "the secondary constraints must be enforced so that no divergences appear in the @xmath166 limit of the equations of motion .",
    "note that one can take @xmath147 without any problems in ( [ eq : secondary - constraint - delta - eom ] ) , so that constraint is satisfied identically .",
    "similarly , using ( [ eq : variation - of - inverse - delta ] ) , ( [ eq : secondary - constraint - phi - eom ] ) becomes @xmath173 which is also automatically satisfied in the @xmath147 limit .",
    "the fact that the secondary constraints automatically vanish is a consequence of using the unprojected constraint ( [ eq : simple - constraint ] ) . had we used ( [ eq : projected - constraint ] ) instead , the troublesome equation of motion ( [ eq : phig - eom - w - higgs - propagator ] )",
    "would be gone , but the secondary constraints become non - trivial and lead again to pathologies ( see appendix [ sec : the - alternate - constraint ] ) .",
    "we have shown that the imposition of symmetry improvement constraints is incompatible with the linear response approximation . since the original symmetry improvement scheme of pilaftsis and teresi",
    "was not formulated @xmath0-covariantly there are actually two natural generalizations : a scheme we have used previously @xcite based on ( [ eq : projected - constraint ] ) and a new one based on the simpler constraint ( [ eq : simple - constraint ] ) .",
    "both schemes are equivalent in equilibrium and both lead , in different ways , to pathologies in the linear response approximation .",
    "there are two types of pathology appearing in our results .",
    "the first is that the higgs field fluctuations propagate masslessly .",
    "the second and more serious pathology is that the goldstone field fluctuations are over - determined , and this over - determination happens in both constraint schemes we consider ( though in different ways ) .",
    "there is no simple modification of the constraint which could possibly fix these problems since we can understand them as a consequence of treating @xmath5 and @xmath9 as independent variables in the 2piea and the inability of symmetry improved 2piea to enforce also the three point _ vertex _",
    "wi .    to see these aspects of the problem consider the first order ward identity for the 1piea , which is the same in form as ( [ eq : wi - first - order ] ) , @xmath174 only now @xmath9 is not independent and @xmath175 is to be understood as arising purely from the variation @xmath109 .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath17 : @xmath176 substituting this into the wi gives @xmath177 and working out the components we get the set of equations @xmath178\\delta\\varphi_{n}\\left(y\\right ) & = -j_{n},\\\\ \\int_{y}\\left[\\tilde{\\delta}_{h}^{-1}\\left(x , y\\right)+\\frac{\\lambda v^{2}}{3}\\delta\\left(x - y\\right)\\right]\\delta\\varphi_{g}\\left(y\\right ) & = -j_{g},\\\\ \\int_{y}\\tilde{\\delta}_{g}^{-1}\\left(x , y\\right)\\delta\\varphi_{g}\\left(y\\right ) & = -j_{g},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is to be contrasted with ( [ eq : phin - eom - massless])-([eq : phig - eom - w - goldstone - propagator ] ) .",
    "this system is consistent if @xmath179 which , of course , is true .",
    "thus , for the 1piea the wi propagates higgs and goldstone fluctuations with the correct masses and source terms .",
    "this is expected because the wi was constructed to be satisfied by the 1pi correlation functions .",
    "there is no longer any reason for this to work if @xmath110 is independent of @xmath109 .",
    "we can extend this analysis by considering ( [ eq : wi - first - order ] ) again . from the definition in terms of the 1piea , @xmath180 , we can write @xmath181 and note that @xmath182 is the three point vertex function .",
    "these relations no longer hold identically for the 2pi correlation functions , but they do hold numerically for the _ exact _ solutions of the untruncated 2pi equations of motion .",
    "we can now extend this to 2piea by writing @xmath183 where @xmath184 encapsulates the additional variations of @xmath9 in the truncated 2piea formalism .",
    "there is a wi for the three point vertex function ( c.f . equation ( 3.6 ) of @xcite ) , @xmath185 which is unaffected by the presence of sources . as with ( [ eq : wi ] ) , @xmath186 in the exact theory , but not automatically in truncations . combining these relations with ( [ eq : wi - first - order ] ) gives : @xmath187 which can be rearranged as @xmath188    if the right hand side vanishes one has ( using the symmetry of @xmath189 ) @xmath190 which is the correct equation of motion for fluctuations .",
    "the failure of these equations to be satisfied is measured by the terms on the right hand side of ( [ eq : fluctuation - eom - vertex - wi ] ) , which have two distinct meanings . the first , @xmath191 ,",
    "measures the failure of the _ vertex _ wi to be satisfied by 2pi approximations , while the second term , @xmath192 , measures the failure of the variations in the 2pi functions @xmath5 and @xmath9 to be linked according to the 1pi relations .",
    "one could try to eliminate the second error term by constraining the variation @xmath110 to be related to @xmath109 in a appropriate way .",
    "this would no longer be working strictly within the 2piea formalism .",
    "rather , it would define a hybrid 2pi-1pi scheme where one computes the equilibrium properties using the symmetry improved 2piea , then defines a resummed 1piea by eliminating @xmath9 from @xmath193 in an appropriate way .",
    "this is similar to the usual resummed 1piea method , only now symmetry improvement is applied self - consistently at the 2pi level .",
    "the first error term is more formidable .",
    "it comes down to the failure of the master 1pi wi in @xmath2piea truncations .",
    "the master wi encodes relations between _ all _ correlation functions in the exact theory",
    ". however , a symmetry improved @xmath2piea scheme only has the power to enforce constraints between the lowest @xmath2 of them . violations of wis involving higher order correlation functions are inevitable in any scheme with fixed finite @xmath2 .",
    "this is not a major issue in equilibrium because one can solve for the @xmath2-point correlation functions in a self - consistently complete @xmath2-loop truncation , and so long as one does not care about the behavior of higher order correlation functions their problems remain invisible .",
    "however , once external sources are turned on and the system departs from equilibrium , variations of the correlation functions appear and these can be related to higher order correlation functions .",
    "violations of the higher order ward identities then feedback into the equations of motion for the fluctuations , leading to an inconsistent system overall .",
    "this leads to our general conclusion : _ all symmetry improved @xmath2piea schemes are incompatible with the linear response approximation_.    it is interesting that the same number of non - trivial constraints is found in both schemes , despite the attempt to reduce their number in the projected scheme .",
    "this is because the projection operator depends on the fields @xmath5 , so it has non - trivial derivatives",
    ". this will be the case for any @xmath0-covariant projection scheme .",
    "this motivates a study of whether it is possible to _ non_-covariantly project out the troublesome constraints , i.e. explicitly break the symmetry in order to save it .",
    "it is worth mentioning the logical possibility that the true behavior of the solutions to the truncated si-2piea equations of motion , when solutions exist , is non - analytic as a function of the sources in the neighborhood of equilibrium .",
    "this would invalidate any attempted taylor series expansion in the sources and so we should expect problems at the linear response level .",
    "we do not know at this time how to further analyze this possibility",
    ".    it would also be interesting to examine whether alternatives to symmetry improvement , such as the method for enforcing constraints using external sources @xcite , can be extended to non - equilibrium situations .",
    "we plan in future work to investigate a scheme with _",
    "softy _ imposed symmetry improvement as a potential workaround for the issues found here and in @xcite .",
    "here we consider using the constraint ( [ eq : projected - constraint ] ) instead of ( [ eq : simple - constraint ] ) for the symmetry improvement . the projection operator in ( [ eq : projected - constraint ] )",
    "forces only goldstone modes to be involved in the constraint .",
    "note that the constraints which have been projected out are valid wis which are obeyed by the 1piea .",
    "this alternate scheme consists of picking a subset of the wis to enforce , chosen in the only @xmath0-covariant way available .",
    "the new constraint is @xmath194 at lowest order this becomes @xmath195 which is the same as before .",
    "however , at first order there are new terms due to the variation of @xmath196 . for reference",
