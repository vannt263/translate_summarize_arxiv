    "let @xmath1 be a complex simple lie algebra of rank @xmath2 , and @xmath3 $ ] the associated loop algebra .",

    "an affinization @xmath5 of a simple @xmath6-module @xmath7 is by definition a simple @xmath4-module whose highest weight is equal to that of @xmath7 .",
    "two affinizations of @xmath7 are said to be equivalent if they are isomorphic as @xmath6-modules .",
    "then one can define a partial ordering on the set of equivalence classes of affinizations of @xmath7 , and minimal ones with respect to this ordering are called minimal affinizations .",
    "an almost complete classification of minimal affinizations was done by chari and pressley in @xcite , and in particular it was proved that , if @xmath1 is of type @xmath8 , for every simple @xmath6-module its minimal affinization is unique .    given a minimal affinization , one can consider its classical limit . by restricting it to the current algebra @xmath9",
    "= { { \\mathfrak g}}\\otimes { \\mathbb{c}}[t]$ ] and taking a pull - back , a graded @xmath9$]-module is obtained . in this article",
    "we call this the _ graded limit_. graded limits are quite important for the study of minimal affinizations since the @xmath6-module structure of a minimal affinization is completely determined by the @xmath10-module structure of its graded limit .",
    "this idea was applied in @xcite to kirillov - reshetikhin modules , which are minimal affinizations whose highest weights are multiples of a fundamental weight .",
    "the graded limits of general minimal affinizations were first studied by moura in @xcite . in the article , he defined some two @xmath9$]-modules using the graded limits of kirillov - reshetikhin modules , and conjectured in all types that the graded limit of a minimal affinization is isomorphic to them .",
    "this conjecture was proved in type @xmath11 and partially in type @xmath12 in the article , and partially in type @xmath13 in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study in more detail the graded limits of minimal affinizations in type @xmath14 .",
    "these are the classical types in which minimal affinizations are unique ( our main interest is in type @xmath0 since type @xmath11 is well - known ) .",
    "in particular , we give a proof to the moura s conjecture in these types ( though we need some modification in type @xmath15 ) .",
