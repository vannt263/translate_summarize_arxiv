    "perturbative quantum chromodynamics has been shown to provide an excellent description of hard scattering processes at particle accelerators .",
    "the quantitative description of high - energy collisions involving hadrons in the initial state relies on the fact that in such interactions the hadronic structure , in terms of their constituent quarks and gluons ( partons ) , may be embodied by universal parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) . in a first approximation",
    "the pdfs can be taken ( at a resolution scale ) to depend only on the momentum ( fraction ) of the parton parallel to that of the hadron to which it belongs ( parent ) .",
    "thus additional degrees of freedom , namely the transverse components of the parton momentum as well as spatial dependences , are disregarded ( integrated out ) .",
    "this defines the so - called collinear approximation , which has been developed over the last few decades by the world community and provides the base for many analyses at current facilities .",
    "the pdfs are typically determined by simultaneously fitting a wide variety of data for large momentum transfer processes ( global analysis ) .",
    "the parameters of the fits describe the pdfs at some initial ( input ) scale , while evolution equations are then used to calculate the pdfs at all other scales needed for the calculations .",
    "although in principle the fundamental distributions in nature are the pdfs for a specific helicity ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 , i.e. corresponding respectively to parton spins aligned and anti - aligned with that of the hadron ) , experiments with unpolarized beams and targets are sensitive only to the averaged helicity distributions or",
    "_ unpolarized _ pdfs ( @xmath2 ) , while information on the _ polarized _ distributions ( @xmath3 ) can be obtained from measurements involving polarized beams and/or targets .",
    "thus traditionally the unpolarized and polarized cases have been treated separately , although in principle one could perform a global fit of polarized and unpolarized data simultaneously .",
    "a comprehensive review on the determination of polarized and unpolarized pdfs has been recently presented in @xcite , in this talk we will briefly discuss some aspects of our latest extractions",
    ". we will start with the unpolarized case in sect .",
    "[ unpolarized ] by discussing some aspects of the recent jr14 analysis @xcite .",
    "section [ polarized ] will be devoted to the polarized case and will report on the first extraction by the jefferson lab angular momentum collaboration , jam13 @xcite , as well as on later results on constraints at large momentum fractions by future data from jefferson lab at 12 gev @xcite .",
    "the recent jr14 update of our distributions @xcite utilizes the world data on dis measurements and data on drell - yan dilepton and ( up to nlo ) high-@xmath4 inclusive jet production for extracting the unpolarized parton distributions of the nucleon together with the ( highly correlated ) strong coupling @xmath5 at nlo and nnlo of perturbative qcd .    to ensure the reliability of our results we have included non - perturbative higher - twist ( ht ) terms , and nuclear corrections for the deuteron structure functions together with off - shell and nuclear shadowing corrections , as well as target - mass corrections for @xmath6 and @xmath7 . to learn about the stability of the results , we performed fits to subsets of data by applying various kinematic ( @xmath8 ) cuts on the available data , since in particular the ht contributions turned out to be sensitive to such choices .",
    "a safe and stable choice turned out to be @xmath9 gev@xmath10 and @xmath11 gev@xmath10 , which are our final nominal cuts imposed on dis data . besides these improvements in the theoretical computations a novelty with respect to our previous analyses is a complete treatment of the systematic uncertainties of the data including experimental correlations .",
    "yet another improvement is the use of the running - mass definition for dis charm and bottom production , which results in an improved stability of the perturbative series . since",
    "heavy quark coefficient functions are exactly known only up to nlo , we have refrained from using dis heavy - quark production data and inclusive jet production data for our nominal nnlo fits ; nevertheless the nlo results are in good agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "the same holds true when fitting the data at nnlo using ( theoretically inconsistent ) nlo matrix elements ( referred to as nnlo * ) or approximate nnlo ones .",
    "it should , however , be kept in mind that the correct order of ( massive ) matrix elements appears to be far more important than the chosen order of pdfs .",
    "an innovation in our global analyses is the explicit study of the dependence of the results on the specific choice of input scale @xmath12 , which in most cases had not been systematically addressed so far . as demonstrated in @xcite ,",
    "although in theory the results should not depend on these choices , in practice a relevant dependence develops as a consequence of what has been called _ procedural _ bias . in principle",
    "this uncertainty should be reduced as much as possible , however the remaining procedural uncertainty in the fits can be estimated through variations of the input scale .",
    "this point is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ input ]         where values of the minimum global @xmath13 and the corresponding @xmath5 values are shown .",
    "note that while the fits remain of comparable quality ( comparable @xmath13 ) until very low values of the input scale ( where perturbation theory starts to break down ) , the sensitivity of other quantities might be larger , as exemplifies here by @xmath5 .",
    "since , except for the @xmath14 values , the fits are done under the exact same conditions , the inability of the global procedure to distinguish different results is due to shortcomings in the procedure itself , for example difficulties of the parametrizations to produce equally optimal shapes of the distributions at different scale ( which are well known to be very different @xcite . to include this uncertainties in our predictions we produce in each case two sets of pdfs , in the so - called dynamical @xmath15 gev@xmath10 ) and standard ( @xmath16 gev@xmath10 ) approaches , thus the uncertainty can be estimated by comparing this two distinct results . in the case of the strong coupling ,",
    "the results obtained for the central values and the statistical uncertainties ( only ) from our nominal dynamical nnlo ( nlo ) analyses are @xmath17 @xmath18 , whereas the standard fits give @xmath19 @xmath20 ; so that an additional uncertainty of @xmath21 can be attributed to procedural uncertainties .",
    "of course , this does not exhaust the list of systematic uncertainties , choices like data selection and genuinely theoretical uncertainties like scheme and scale choices in the analysis should also be considered , and would further increase the total error .",
    "our dynamical and standard results should be relevant for the calculation of cross - sections at ongoing experiments at the lhc .",
    "it should be emphasized that , on purpose , we have not included tevatron gauge - boson production data and lhc data in our fitting procedure , in order to allow for genuine _ predictions _ of these measurements .",
    "detailed benchmark of our results and comparisons with other groups have been presented in @xcite and can not be repeated here .",
    "however , for illustration , we compare in fig .",
    "[ benchmarks ] our dynamical and standard predictions for gauge boson production with lhc data @xcite and results from abm11@xcite and mstw08@xcite .",
    "note that although each of our new results has a relatively small error , due partially to our rather stringent tolerance criteria for 1@xmath22 parameter errors ( @xmath23 ) , the combination of our dynamical and standard fits provides an estimation of the uncertainties which is closer in side to our previous results ( where less stringent tolerance criteria were used ) , although the improvement in accuracy is also noticeable .",
    "the first global nlo analysis of spin - dependent pdfs from the jam collaboration @xcite utilizes the available data on inclusive polarized dis from protons , deuterons and @xmath24he .",
    "where possible , we have fitted directly the measured polarization asymmetries , rather than relying on structure functions extracted under different conditions than the unpolarized cross sections .",
    "we include data from all polarized dis experiments that lie within the limits @xmath25  gev@xmath10 and @xmath26  gev@xmath10 , which allows us to constrain the @xmath27 and @xmath28 distributions . ] up to @xmath29 .",
    "obtaining stable fits over this expanded kinematic range necessitates systematically accounting for target mass and higher twist corrections , which are vital for describing the @xmath30 and @xmath31 structure functions at the lower @xmath32 range , and nuclear smearing corrections for deuterium and @xmath24he nuclei , which have major impact at large  @xmath33 .",
    "the results of the jam13 fits indicate that the @xmath28 distribution has a significantly larger magnitude in the intermediate-@xmath33 region ( @xmath34 ) than in previous analyses , due primarily to the sizable higher twist corrections found here and shown in fig .",
    "[ polarizedht ] .",
    "in particular , the twist @xmath35 term makes important contributions to both the @xmath30 and @xmath31 structure functions of the proton , and the @xmath36 correction makes a large and positive contribution to the neutron @xmath30 .",
    "the latter is mostly responsible for driving the @xmath28 distribution to become more negative .",
    "the induced twist-3 contribution to the proton @xmath30 also reduces the size of the twist-4 term compared to that found previously .",
    "the @xmath35 correction to the neutron @xmath31 is compatible with zero within errors .",
    "this clearly highlights the importance of including subleading @xmath37 corrections in any analysis that attempts to fit data down to @xmath38  gev@xmath10 , and even if more stringent cuts are imposed .",
    "an illustration of the effects of the corrections studied in the jam13 analysis is presented in fig",
    ".  [ polarizedpdfs ] , where beginning with the reference twist-2 nlo qcd parametrizations ( without any additional corrections ) the cumulative effects of the nuclear smearing , target mass and higher twist corrections on the @xmath27 and @xmath28 distributions are demonstrated explicitly .",
    "the impact of these corrections is negligible at small values of @xmath33 , @xmath39 , but grows increasingly important at higher @xmath33 .",
    "compared with the reference distributions , both the jam @xmath27 and @xmath28 pdfs are larger in magnitude , by @xmath40 for the @xmath41 quark at @xmath42 , and by more than @xmath43 for the @xmath44 quark at @xmath45 .",
    "the same effects are more clearly illustrated in the form of ratios of polarized to unpolarized pdfs @xmath46 and @xmath47 , shown in fig .",
    "[ polarizedpdfs](right ) .",
    "such a comparison is meaningful since the unpolarized pdfs are fitted within the same analysis and applied consistently in the extraction of the polarized pdfs .",
    "we have also investigated whether existing data from polarized lepton ",
    "nucleon dis is able to provide any constraints on the @xmath48 behavior of spin - dependent pdfs in the context of a global qcd analysis . using the jam13 fit as a baseline",
    ", we found @xcite that demanding the polarized to unpolarized pdf ratios @xmath49 to approach unity at @xmath50 results in equally good fits to the available data , even though the resulting changes to the @xmath28 pdf are significant in the intermediate-@xmath33 region . with",
    "dramatically different behaviors for the @xmath47 ratio allowed for @xmath51 , this highlights the critical need for precise data sensitive to the @xmath44 quark polarization at large @xmath33 values .    constraining the behavior of the polarization asymmetries @xmath52 , and consequently of the spin - dependent pdfs , in the limit as @xmath48 is one of the featured goals of the experimental physics program planned for the 12  gev energy upgraded cebaf accelerator at jefferson lab .",
    "data from several experiments are expected to be collected for values of @xmath33 as high as @xmath53 for dis kinematics , and even higher @xmath33 in the nucleon resonance region .",
    "this should significantly reduce the pdf uncertainties for @xmath54 , especially for the @xmath28 distribution , which will be more strongly constrained by new data on the @xmath24he asymmetry .         to estimate the possible impact of the new jefferson lab data we @xcite use the projected statistical and systematic uncertainties for the proposed experiments at the @xmath33 and @xmath32 values where the asymmetries will be measured .",
    "the pseudo - data are generated by randomly distributing the central values of the points around the jam fit for hydrogen , deuterium and @xmath24he targets ( distributing them around other predictions would be equally suitable ) .",
    "the reduction in the pdf uncertainties , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ jlab12 ] , is significant , with the relative error on @xmath27 and @xmath28 decreasing by @xmath55 for @xmath56 at the input scale @xmath57  gev@xmath10 .",
    "we have reported on some aspect of our latest updates of unpolarized @xcite and polarized @xcite pdfs . in both cases",
    "we find that the inclusion of data at relatively low @xmath32 and @xmath58 values , as well as a wealth of data on nuclear targets , provides additional valuable information on the partonic structure of the nucleon . in the polarized case",
    "it has helped to increase the statistical accuracy of our previous analyses @xcite , while in the polarized case it has lead to important changes in the central values of the distributions .",
    "in addition it has been shown that rather than arbitrarily increasing the estimated uncertainties by using a tolerance criteria @xmath59 for the propagation of experimental uncertainties , a viable approach is the estimation of the remaining procedural bias in the global fits through variations of the input scale ( dynamical vs. standard approaches ) .    to finalize we have discussed the need for precise polarized dis data at large values of @xmath51 , especially to determine the @xmath28 distribution .",
    "this is one of the goal of the 12 gev update of jefferson lab and we have shown that the projected experimental uncertainties will be able to reduce current uncertainties by about 70% in the large-@xmath33 region .",
