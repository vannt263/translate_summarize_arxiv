    "observations of edge - on , star - forming galaxies indicate that many ( possibly most ) such systems display extra - planar emission ( ` halos ' ) . where sufficient observations exist ,",
    "these halos are known to be both multi - phase , displaying all of the components of the in - disk interstellar medium ( ism ) , as well as highly structured , revealing vertical features over a variety of spatial scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "mass flux estimates thus far @xcite imply that disk - halo outflow is responsible for transporting large quantities of gas and , as a result , has an important role to play in the evolution of galaxies , from metallicity gradients in disks to altered star formation rates ( sfrs ) .",
    "spatially resolved observations of nearby edge - on galaxies provide us with important data for studying the details of such disk - halo outflows .",
    "early observations of edge - on galaxies showed that radio continuum emission can extend several kpc above the plane @xcite , and this emission is dominated by non - thermal synchrotron radiation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicative of magnetic fields and cosmic rays ( crs ) .",
    "galactic winds may also be present , since crs can drive outflows , as first pointed out by @xcite ; such outflows or ` feedback ' are crucial to galaxy formation scenarios .",
    "dust in galaxy halos was first observed in the form of vertical filaments in absorption against starlight @xcite and , later in emission from high resolution space - based infra - red ( ir ) observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . extracting the physical conditions of dust , which is present over a range of sizes , compositions and excitation conditions , requires careful modelling of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and therefore observations at a variety of infrared wavelengths .",
    "although such modelling is routinely carried out for galaxy disks , it has proved more difficult for the weaker halo emission [ but see @xcite ] . with fewer data points , however , it is still possible to constrain some dust properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , especially in the ` classical ' regime in which grains reach equilibrium temperatures .    in this paper , we present the results of observations at 617 mhz as well as at two sub - mm wavelengths , @xmath10 @xmath11 m and @xmath12 @xmath11 m , of two edge - on galaxies ",
    "ngc  3044 and ngc  4157  in order to study both the in - disk emission and any halo emission which might be present .",
    "since synchrotron emission is stronger at lower frequencies , halos should be more easily detected than at high radio frequencies for comparable signal - to - noise ( s / n ) .",
    "a clear example can be found in @xcite . as for dust ,",
    "the sub - mm wavelengths are known to be probes of cold dust and are less likely to be contaminated by contributions from hot or warm components and/or stochastically heated very small grains .",
    "such data also provide the best estimate of total dust mass .",
    "adopting these wavebands also allows us to probe the far infrared ( fir ) - radio continuum relation ( see next subsection ) in these galaxies .    in the next two subsections",
    ", we discuss the fir - radio continuum relation and introduce the two galaxies . in sect .",
    "[ sec : observations ] , we provide details of the observations and data reduction .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] and [ sec : conclusions ] present the discussion and conclusions , respectively .",
    "the well - known relationship between thermal fir emission from dust and the predominantly non - thermal synchrotron emission in galaxies @xcite is believed to result from the dependence of both on massive star formation @xcite .",
    "the same stars that provide ultraviolet ( uv ) photons to heat the dust are also destined to become supernovae , thus producing non - thermal radio emission . what is still a puzzle",
    ", however , is how the relation can be so tight over many orders of magnitude among galaxies that have a range of properties , for example , differing ism masses , dust masses , metallicities , sfrs and possible differences as to how optically thick or optically thin galaxies are to uv photons and cr electrons .",
    "similar arguments apply to the correlation which has also been found _ within _ galaxies . as a result , other possibilities have been proposed for the origin of the relation , for example coupling between the magnetic field strength and the gas density ; since it is well known that gas and dust density vary together , one would expect higher synchrotron emission wherever the dust emission is higher @xcite .",
    "one observational difficulty has been the traditional choice of the 1.4 ghz radio frequency ( which includes a small but non - negligible thermal contribution ) and fir emission at @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath11 m ( which includes contributions from both warm and cold dust ) .",
    "an early attempt at separating the various spectral contributions within m  31 @xcite suggested that a good relation still exists between non - thermal radio emission and _ cold _ dust , the former driven by supernovae and the latter heated by the general interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) rather than solely by hot young stars , i.e. the direct link with star - forming regions is less clear .",
    "@xcite later found a slightly non - linear relation between the radio continuum and cold dust ( @xmath15 ) and suggest that there may be a non - linear dependence of radio emission on sfr .",
    "see also @xcite and @xcite for further discussion .",
    "a better approach is to observe the radio emission at a frequency that is strongly dominated by the non - thermal component , so that assumptions and corrections for the thermal contribution are not required .",
    "this is especially important when searching for correlations within a given galaxy since the thermal contribution can vary strongly from place to place .",
    "we have taken this approach by choosing the low radio frequency of 617 mhz .",
    "similarly , by searching for correlations with @xmath12 @xmath11 m emission , the isrf - heated cold dust component is more likely to be isolated .",
    "such an approach has been taken by @xcite who find a good correlation between these two wavebands within the galaxy , ngc  5775 .",
    "an important refinement is to consider whether a smoothed version of the sub - mm emission improves upon the relation , should one be found .",
    "for example , @xcite proposed that , since the mean free path of a uv photon to dust absorption is much less than the diffusion length of a typical cr electron , we would expect that the fir - radio continuum relation ( or , in our case , the 617 mhz - 850 @xmath11 m relation ) will be improved if the fir emission is smoothed spatially .",
    "such an improvement has been observed by murphy et al .",

    "regarding timescales , from the mean magnetic field strength ( @xmath44 @xmath11 g ) found throughout the disk and the observed halo of ngc  3044 @xcite , the mean cosmic ray electron lifetime is @xmath45 yr ( see sect .",

    "as noted earlier , the 617 mhz emission in ngc  3044 shows curvature towards the north on both ends of the major axis of ngc  3044 which sometimes suggests that ram pressure stripping could be occurring as the galaxy passes through an intergalactic medium ( igm ) in a southerly direction .",
    "however , there is no such evidence in the hi emission and , in fact , hi extensions are observed on both the north and south sides of the major axis .",

    "[ fig : correlations ] ) , consistent with earlier results @xcite .",
    "this kernel ` corrects ' for differences between the photon mean free path to dust absorption and the cr electron diffusion length .",
    "we find , not only that the correlation improves , but also that it becomes clearly non - linear such that @xmath51 ; that is , the relationship is roughly consistent with a luminosity relation of @xmath52 . by comparison , @xcite found @xmath53 and @xcite found a roughly linear 617 mhz - @xmath1 m relation for ngc  5775 .",
    "neither of these authors applied a smearing kernal and , as fig .",
    "[ fig : correlations ] illustrates , the correlation becomes much flatter ( @xmath54 , table  [ properties_table ] ) , when a smoothing kernel is ignored .",
    "@xcite have shown that galaxies with higher sfrs per unit area have lower kernel scale lengths .",
    "they interpret this result to imply that galaxies with high sfrs contain , on average , younger sf regions from which cr electrons have not had sufficient time to diffuse to large scales . when sf has not been so recent , by contrast , the difference between the radio continuum scale and the dust scale diminishes .    as indicated in sect .",
    "[ sec : correlations ] , it is not straightforward to interpret the meaning of the kernel size for an edge - on galaxy in which the line of sight that is being probed varies with position and may probe a range of sf regions of varying ages .",
    "in addition , our best result corresponds to a gaussian kernel which can not be directly compared to the exponentials used by @xcite in more face - on systems .",
    "nevertheless , we can consider some representative timescales to see whether our kernel size could reasonably represent a link between the cr electron and dust heating scales .",
    "for example , based on spatially resolved images at @xmath2 cm and @xmath55 cm , the minimum energy magnetic field strength in ngc  3044 has a mean value of @xmath56 g , ranging from 3.5 to 8.9 @xmath11 g to within uncertainties of approximately a factor of 2 @xcite .",
    "the lifetime for cosmic ray electrons against synchrotron and inverse compton losses , for an isotropic velocity distribution of cr electrons , is given by ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the magnetic field strength and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the magnetic field and radiation energy densities , respectively .",
    "taking @xmath61 and @xmath62 , then @xmath63 and we find @xmath64 yr ( ranging from to 3.3 to 14@xmath65 yr ) .",
    "this implies that the 617 mhz emission is measuring a massive sf history of ngc  3044 that is integrated over @xmath7 yr ; it is not measuring the recent sf activity in the galaxy .    in this time , how far can cr electrons diffuse ?",
    "the diffusion timescale can be written @xcite , @xmath66 where @xmath67 represents the distance that a cr electron can diffuse from its point of origin via a random walk , assuming an energy - dependent diffusion coefficient . setting @xmath68 yields @xmath69 4.3 kpc .",
    "this is a significant distance and sufficient to allow cr electrons to ` fill ' the galaxy disk , assuming that sf has been widely distributed over the past @xmath7 yr .",
    "if the cold dust is heated by the isrf which is similarly widely distributed throughout the disk then , at least to order of magnitude , our smoothing kernel should represent roughly the difference between the cr electron diffusion length and the dust mean free path to isrf photons .",
    "the latter is not known for ngc  3044 ( and likely varies ) , but in our own galaxy , a typical dust cross - section to absorption and scattering in the visible through uv part of the spectrum for big grains , @xmath70 , ranges from 0.2 to 1 @xmath71 @xmath72 per hydrogen atom @xcite . for",
    "this range of dust cross - section and using the mean ism gas density in ngc  3044 of @xmath73 @xmath74 @xcite , the mean free path of isrf photons to dust is @xmath75 kpc .",
    "our gaussian smoothing kernel of @xmath76 kpc ( table  [ tab : fir_rad ] ) corresponds to a radius ( half - width at half maximum ) of @xmath771.0 kpc .",
    "if we convolve this size scale with @xmath78 , the result is @xmath79 kpc which can now be compared to @xmath80 kpc estimated above .",
    "although there are many uncertainties and assumptions in this comparison , the result indicates that the interpretation of the smoothing kernel as accounting for the difference between the cr electron diffusion scale and the photon mean free path to dust is reasonable .",
    "our results suggest that there is a clear link between synchrotron emission , which measures the integrated massive sf history in the galaxy over a few 10@xmath81 yr , and the isrf - heated cold dust . in the latter case ,",
    "the fraction of heating that is due to fuv photons from young massive stars is uncertain ( e.g. see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "older stars contribute approximately an order of magnitude more photons than ob stars in the solar neighbourhood @xcite whereas the cross - section for large grains increases by only a factor of 5 from the infrared through the ultraviolet @xcite .",
    "in addition , we are considering emission from regions ( of order 4.3 kpc , see above ) which are much larger than typical regions within which hot massive stars exist ; the heating source for the @xmath1 m dust emission over such size scales is then the cooler stellar population ( as has been found by other authors previously ) , rather than the hot , young massive stars that eventually give rise to the synchrotron emission via supernovae .",
    "what then is the connection and the reason for the non - linear relation ?",
    "we first note that non - linear relations have been observed before , especially when considering those of lower luminosity ( @xmath82 ) and/or galaxies that have been studied at low radio frequencies ( @xmath83 ghz ) . in such cases , the relation @xmath84 , where @xmath85 has been observed . such a trend has been interpreted as reflecting an increasing contribution from older stars in heating the dust , a non - linear relation between the sfr and radio continuum emission , or an underproduction of both radio and and infrared emission in low luminosity galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to our knowledge , however , a slope as steep as @xmath86 has not previously been observed , likely because of the lack of smoothing as described above .",
    "the closest comparisons are to the results of @xcite and @xcite for ngc  5775 and m  31 , respectively , who both find approximately linear relations between non - thermal radio emission and cold dust , in agreement with our result when a smoothing kernel is ignored .    for both the 617 mhz and @xmath1 m emission",
    ", we are observing optically thin emission over equivalent lines of sight .",
    "then the relation compares the emissivities of the two components ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . for synchrotron emission ,",
    "the emission coefficient can be expressed as , @xmath87 where @xmath88 represents number density of cr electrons , @xmath58 is the magnetic field strength ( we take @xmath89 ) , and @xmath90 is the power law slope of the cr electron spectrum .",
    "there is substantial observational and theoretical evidence for an approximately constant alfvn speed in the ism leading to @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the gas density ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and others ) .",
    "in addition , we expect that @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the massive sfr .",
    "if we accept that the massive sfr is governed by a schmidt law such that @xmath95 , then the above equation becomes , @xmath96    for the dust emissivity , we have , @xmath97 which is essentially a variant of eqn .  [ eqn : modified ] in which the optical depth is expressed explicitly as a function of the number density of dust grains ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "if we take a constant gas / dust ratio , then @xmath99 . in addition , variations in gas density in the ism can be many orders of magnitude , whereas a reasonable variation in the cold dust temperature results in a variation in @xmath100 of factors of a few ( e.g. increasing the error bar on @xmath101 for ngc  3044 by a factor of two varies @xmath100 by a factor of approximately @xmath30 2 ) .",
    "dust temperatures may vary a great deal in the ism , but since we are considering only the @xmath1 m emission which we have linked to the cold dust of ngc  3044 only , we will assume that gas density variations dominate and approximate the cold dust emission as , @xmath102 another way of expressing the above is that the isrf imposes an essentially constant heating effect on @xmath103 due to a presumed dominance of widespread and long - lived cooler stars to this heating .",
    "combining eqns .",
    "[ eqn : synch ] and [ eqn : cold_dust ] and restoring the flux nomenclature yields , @xmath104 taking the observational results for the schmidt law summarized by @xcite , i.e. @xmath105 , and using the mean spectral index between @xmath2 and @xmath106 cm measured by @xcite for ngc  3044 , @xmath107 , leading to @xmath108 , we find , @xmath109 which agrees with the measured @xmath110 for ngc  3044 , within errors .",
    "see @xcite for an earlier example of this kind of approach .",
    "it is important to note the variations that can occur in the above indices .",
    "the measured spectral index of ngc  3044 , for example , ranges from -1.0 to 0.2 within the galaxy and may differ from these values at the lower frequency that has been used in these observations . as for the schmidt law , theoretical considerations result in values that can generally be found in the range , @xmath111 @xcite , though a free - fall value yields @xmath112 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* his eqn .",
    "observationally , variations in @xmath113 are also observed @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the above result shows that a simple application of the average spectral index and the most universally accepted schmidt law provides a reasonable explanation for the 617 mhz - 850 @xmath11 m correlation found in ngc  3044 . for this result , it is important that the non - thermal radio emission and cold dust emission are sufficiently isolated spectrally and that the dust scale length is adjusted through smoothing .",
    "to summarize , if we assume a constant isrf heating of the cold dust , then the link between synchrotron emission and cold dust is via the gas density .",
    "a higher gas density yields a higher sfr and a higher magnetic field , both of which affect the synchrotron emission , and a higher gas density yields a higher dust density leading to a higher cold dust emission .",
    "we have observed the edge - on galaxies , ngc  3044 and ngc  4157 at 617 mhz using the gmrt and at @xmath10 and @xmath12 @xmath11 m using the jcmt .",
    "these are the first results for these two galaxies at these wavelengths .",
    "the main results are as follows .",
    "@xmath114 for ngc  3044 , high latitude emission is observed at 617 mhz , consistent with previous radio continuum results and some evidence is present at low intensities for vertical extensions at @xmath12 @xmath11 m also .",
    "@xmath114 at the far ends of the major axis of ngc  3044 , there appear to be disturbances which have resulted in 617 mhz emission extending away from the plane towards the north .",
    "the most most obvious of these begin on the far south - east end of the major axis , including some disconnected features , one of which we have named the non - thermal cloud ( ntc ) .",
    "order - of - magnitude calculations suggest that the ntc could have originated from activity related to star - formation in the galaxy s disk .",
    "another radio continuum extension is seen on the nw end of the major axis at which an hi supershell is known .",
    "such disturbances will be more effective at ejecting material away from the plane if they are at large galactocentric radii where the disk density is lower .    @xmath114 some high latitude 617 mhz emission is observed in ngc  4157 but we do not have the sensitivity to unambiguously detect halo dust emission at either @xmath10 @xmath11 m or @xmath12 @xmath11 m for this galaxy .",
    "a large radio continuum extension is seen towards the south beginning at the end of the north - eastern major axis in this galaxy and appears to correlate with high - latitude emission seen at @xmath38 @xmath11 m from the wise satellite .",
    "@xmath114 we could not fit a single temperature model to the sub - mm spectrum for either ngc  3044 or ngc  4157 , but could fit both spectra with a two - temperature model . for ngc  3044 , we find t@xmath115 k and t@xmath50 k and for ngc  4157 , we find t@xmath116 k and t@xmath117 k. for the latter galaxy , we do not detect emission at the largest galactocentric radii .",
    "dust masses are @xmath118 and @xmath119 for ngc  3044 and ngc  4157 , respectively .",
    "there is more cold than warm dust in both galaxies .",
    "@xmath114 we find a clear correlation between the 617 mhz and @xmath12 @xmath11 m emission for both ngc  3044 and ngc  4157 .",
    "this correlation improves significantly if a smoothing kernel is applied to the @xmath12 @xmath11 m data to account for differences between the mean free path of a dust - heating photon and the diffusion length of cr electrons in the ism .",
    "simple timescale and length scale arguments suggest that such a smoothing kernel can indeed account for these differences .",
    "@xmath114 with an applied smoothing kernel , the 617 mhz and @xmath12 @xmath11 m correlation becomes strongly non - linear .",
    "for the best data set and the one in which the @xmath12 @xmath11 m is strongly dominated by cold dust ( i.e. ngc  3044 ) , we find @xmath110 .",
    "@xmath114 the non - linear relation between synchrotron emission and cold dust can be understood if the heating of the cold dust is the isrf in which cooler stars ( rather than hot young stars ) dominate , leading to variations in cold dust emission that are dominated by density rather than temperature variations .",
    "synchrotron emission depends on the magnetic field strength and cr electron generation , both of which depend on gas density via @xmath120 and the schmidt law , respectively . with these assumptions , @xmath121 which agrees with the observed correlation .",

    "<S> high latitude emission has been detected in both the radio continuum and sub - mm for ngc  3044 and in the radio continuum for ngc  4157 , including several new features . </S>",
    "<S> for ngc  3044 , in addition , we find 617 mhz emission extending to the north of the major axis , beginning at the far ends of the major axis . </S>",
    "<S> one of these low intensity features , more than 10 kpc from the major axis , has apparently associated emission at @xmath2 cm and may be a result of in - disk activity related to star formation .    the dust spectrum at long wavelengths required fitting with a two - temperature model for both galaxies , implying the presence of cold dust ( t@xmath3 k for ngc  3044 and t@xmath4 k for ngc  4157 ) . </S>",
    "<S> dust masses are @xmath5 and @xmath6 for ngc  3044 and ngc  4157 , respectively , and are dominated by the cold component .    </S>",
    "<S> there is a clear correlation between the 617 mhz and @xmath1 m emission in the two galaxies . in the case of ngc  3044 for which the @xmath1 m data are strongly dominated by cold dust </S>",
    "<S> , this implies a relation between the non - thermal synchrotron emission and cold dust . </S>",
    "<S> the 617 mhz component represents an integration of massive star formation over the past @xmath7 yr and the @xmath1 m emission represents heating from the diffuse interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) .    the 617 mhz  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 m correlation improves when a smoothing kernel is applied to the @xmath1 m data to account for differences between the cr electron diffusion scale and the mean free path of an isrf photon to dust . </S>",
    "<S> the best - fit relation is @xmath8 for ngc  3044 . </S>",
    "<S> if variations in the cold dust emissivity are dominated by variations in dust density , and the synchrotron emission depends on magnetic field strength ( a function of gas density ) as well as cr electron generation ( a function of massive star formation rate and therefore density via the schmidt law ) then the expected correlation for ngc  3044 is @xmath9 , in agreement with the observed correlation .    </S>",
