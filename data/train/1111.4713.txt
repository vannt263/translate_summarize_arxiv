    "specker @xcite pointed out many years ago that the transitivity of implication does not always hold for the outcomes of a sequence of quantum measurements .",
    "this observation has been expanded on in a number of ways in recent years .",
    "klyachko et al @xcite derived an inequality that must be satisfied by any realistic noncontextual theory for the averages of certain measurements carried out on a qutrit .",
    "if the measurements are associated with the vertices of a pentagon , then violations of the inequality can be interpreted as a failure of the transitivity of implication between the outcomes of neighboring measurements on the pentagon .",
    "for this reason , the klyachko inequality can be referred to as a  pentagon inequality \" .",
    "the klyachko inequality can be generalized by replacing the qutrit by a qudit ( i.e. a d - state system with d @xmath0 3 ) and by considering measurements associated with graphs more complicated than a pentagon .",
    "these generalizations , and their implications for nonlocality and other issues in quantum information , have been explored by a number of authors @xcite . in parallel with these theoretical investigations , violations of the pentagon and related inequalities",
    "have been observed in a variety of four - state systems realized using ions @xcite , neutrons @xcite , photons @xcite and nuclear spins @xcite .",
    "+ the purpose of this paper is to present a number of pentagon inequalities for a four - state system using a system of 60 real rays in four dimensions derived from the vertices of a 600-cell .",
    "we @xcite recently used these rays to give a large number of  parity proofs \" of the kochen - specker ( ks ) theorem @xcite . here",
    "we show that these same rays yield a number of pentagon inequalities that can be used to rule out realistic noncontextual theories .",
    "this in itself may not cause much surprise since violations of such inequalities have been exhibited earlier .",
    "however what makes our results interesting is that they permit us to give an affirmative answer to the following question raised at the end of @xcite :  take any kochen - specker graph in 3 or 4 dimensions leading to an absolute rather than a probabilistic kochen - specker contradiction .",
    "enumerate all its ( pentagon ) subgraphs .",
    "is it by any chance the case that every real vector in hilbert space will violate at least one of the corresponding ( pentagon ) inequalities ?",
    "\" we show that the 60 rays of the 600-cell yield a large number of pentagon inequalities that cover hilbert space so densely that every real four dimensional vector leads to a violation of at least one of these inequalities .",
    "this is what we mean when we state , in the title to this note , that the violation of the pentagon inequalities is universal .",
    "we also discuss violations of heptagon inequalities by the same set of 60 rays , as well as some related geometrical matters that may be of interest in connection with discussions of contextuality .",
    "let @xmath1 , be five states in a four - dimensional hilbert space whose only orthogonalities are given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes addition modulo 5 .",
    "these states can be placed at the vertices of a pentagon in such a way that the only orthogonalities between them are between states at adjacent vertices . for this reason",
    ", we will refer to these states as a  pentagon \" and the inequality satisfied by them , to be derived now , as the  pentagon inequality \" .",
    "consider the operator @xmath4 , which we will term the  pentagon operator \" . according to noncontextual realism , @xmath5 , with the average taken in an arbitrary quantum state .",
    "this conclusion follows from the facts that ( 1 ) any projector , @xmath6 , returns the value 0 or 1 upon measurement , and ( 2 ) no two orthogonal projectors both return a 1 when measured on the same state , if one makes the additional assumption , characteristic of noncontextual realism , that all projectors possess definite values in any quantum state that merely reveal themselves upon measurement@xcite .",
    "these conditions require one to assign a 0 or 1 to each of the projectors in a pentagon operator in such a way that no two neighboring projectors are both assigned a 1 . but",
    "this implies that no more than two of the projectors can be assigned a 1 for a given quantum state , and hence that the average value of the pentagon operator in any state can never exceed 2 .",
    "this is the pentagon inequality . in order to rule out noncontextual realism",
    ", all one has to do is to find an example of a quantum state in which the expectation value of the pentagon operator is greater than 2 .",
    "this can be done by finding a  pentagon \" of states whose pentagon operator has a largest eigenvalue greater than 2 .",
    "the eigenstate corresponding to this largest eigenvalue is then an example of a state in which the average value of the pentagon operator can be measured to reveal a conflict with noncontextual realism ( this choice in fact leads to the largest conflict possible ) .",
    "we will refer to a pentagon of states whose pentagon operator has an eigenvalue greater than 2 as a  conflict pentagon \" .",
    "+ the pentagon inequality was first derived for a three - state system by klyachko et al @xcite , who also identified a set of states for which the pentagon operator had a largest eigenvalue of @xmath7 ( which is appreciably above the bound of 2 for a realist noncontextual theory ) .",
    "pentagons in four dimensions were investigated by badziag et al @xcite , who found a number of different examples of conflict pentagons .",
    "one of them was contained in a set of 18 vectors that had been used earlier @xcite to prove the ks theorem , and the corresponding pentagon operator had a largest eigenvalue of 2.171 .",
    "this result suggested two ideas to us .",
    "the first was to examine other sets of kochen - specker vectors in four dimensions to see if they contained conflict pentagons .",
    "however we found that a kochen - specker set of vectors need not , in general , contain any conflict pentagons in it .",
    "the second was to look at the set of 24 vectors of peres @xcite that contained the 18 just mentioned , and to see whether the several conflict pentagons contained in this larger set led to a violation of at least one of the corresponding pentagon inequalities by an arbitrary real vector .",
    "however this hope was dashed by the discovery that the 24 defining vectors themselves led to an expectation value of no larger than 2 for any of the pentagon operators in the set . despite these initial setbacks , we succeeded in identifying a symmetrical set of 60 vectors in four dimensions that allowed us to succeed at both of the tasks just mentioned .",
    "it is to this set that we now turn .",
    "the system of 60 states we use in this work is associated with the vertices of a four - dimensional regular polytope known as the 600-cell .",
    "we pointed out recently @xcite that these states yield over a 100 million parity proofs of the ks theorem .",
    "each of the 60 states is associated with an antipodal pair of vertices of the 600-cell , and the ( real ) vectors that describe them are shown in table [ tab : ray ] . +      .the 60 states associated with the vertices of a 600-cell .",
    "the states are unnormalized and represented as real , four - dimensional vectors of length 2 .",
    "the four numbers following each state are its components in an orthonormal basis , with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , a bar over a number indicating its negative and commas omitted between components .",
    "the 60 vectors shown here represent half the vertices of a 600-cell centered at the origin , with their negatives representing the remaining vertices . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     an argument similar to the one for @xmath10 shows that for @xmath11 a violation of noncontextual realism requires that @xmath12 if @xmath13 is even or @xmath14 if @xmath13 is odd , with the n - gon operator now being the sum of the n projectors involved .",
    "we find that the only higher n - gons that lead to a conflict with noncontextual realism are heptagons ( or 7-gons ) .",
    "the conflict is very weak , with @xmath15 only being slightly larger than 3 , as shown in table [ tab : heptagons ] .",
    "neither the heptagons in sets a or b suffice to establish a universal violation , but that is not a drawback since the pentagons already achieved that goal .",
    "+      although the n - gons with @xmath16 do not lead to a conflict with nonlocal realism of the sort considered here , it is possible that they could be used as scaffolds for other constructions that do . we thought it worth pointing out their existence in case they find this or other applications .",
    "+ in conclusion , we have demonstrated that the system of 60 states derived from a 600-cell yields a variety of pentagon inequalities that can be used as the basis for an experimental disproof of noncontextual realism that is universal ( in the sense that it holds for all states represented by real four - dimensional vectors ) .",
    "it is interesting that the same 30-ray sets that provide parity proofs of the ks theorem can also be exploited to give this alternative disproof of noncontextual realism .",
