    "ultracold atoms in optical lattices are not only fascinating many - body systems _ per se _ , they also help to better understand interaction models and correlation phenomena in condensed matter physics @xcite .",

    "quantum many - body problems in the thermodynamic limit can almost never be solved exactly and thus require approximate investigation methods . during the last 20 years the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) has proved to be a reliable approximation scheme for correlated lattice fermions ( electrons ) in dimension @xmath2 metzner89,pruschke95,georges96,kotliar04 .",
    "the bosonic counterpart of the dmft  the b - dmft  was developed only most recently @xcite .",
    "the b - dmft is a thermodynamically consistent , conserving and non - perturbative theoretical framework for the investigation of correlated bosons on a lattice .",

    "the b - dmft has the important property that it treats normal and condensed bosons on equal footing and thus includes the effects caused by their dynamic coupling @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the seminal static mean - field theory of fisher _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and the equivalent gutzwiller approximation @xcite , which focus on the condensed bosons and treat normal bosons as immobile .",
    "explicit results of the b - dmft were so far obtained for the bosonic falicov - kimball model @xcite and the bosonic hubbard model @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend the dmft and b - dmft and formulate a dynamical mean - field theory for _ mixtures _ of correlated lattice bosons and fermions .",
    "the theoretical framework derived in this way , referred to as bf - dmft in the following , is a generalization of both the fermionic dmft and the b - dmft .",
    "it provides a set of self - consistency equations which are valid for arbitrary coupling parameters and temperatures , and which describe the static and dynamic properties of a system of mutually interacting lattice bosons and fermions .",
    "these bf - dmft equations are exact in the limit @xmath3 and provide a comprehensive , non - perturbative approximation scheme for bose - fermi mixtures on lattices with finite @xmath1 . similar to the b",
    "- dmft the bf - dmft derived here treats normal and ( pair-)condensed particles on equal footing .",
    "since the bf - dmft includes many - body correlations and the dynamic coupling between normal and condensed particles in a systematic way it extends earlier theoretical investigations of bose - fermi mixtures formulated in the continuum @xcite and on lattices @xcite . a dynamic coupling between fermions in bose - fermi mixtures was included by titvinidze , snoek , and hofstetter @xcite who treated fermions within dmft and bosons within the gutzwiller approximation .",
    "one of the most interesting questions in this context concerns the renormalization of the interaction between bosons and between fermions due to the interaction between bosons and fermions . employing the many - body bf - dmft formulated in this paper we find that the effective interactions between bosons and between fermions can indeed be _ attractive _ , and can thus lead to phase instabilities towards superfluid fermions or phase - separated bosons .",

    "we introduce two models of correlated , spinless lattice bosons interacting with correlated lattice fermions without spin ( model i ) and with spin ( model ii ) . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we derive the bf - dmft self - consistency equations for these models and discuss some of their properties , e.g. , the emergence of effective attractions between bosons due to the interaction with fermions , and _ vice versa_.",
    "in the following we consider two different models for correlated lattice bosons ( @xmath4 ) and fermions ( @xmath5 ) with local interactions . in the first model ( model i ) all particles or atoms are spinless .",

    "ii the bosons are still spinless , but the fermions now carry a spin one - half .",

    "( dyson_b ) and ( [ dyson_f ] ) .    the scaled hopping amplitudes @xmath70 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ b1 ] ) need to be determined such that in the non - interacting ( @xmath71 ) case the linear gross - pitaevski equation @xmath72 is satisfied for a given lattice @xcite .",
    "the real - space formulation presented here can be employed to study mixtures of bosons and fermions on a lattice in the presence of external potentials .",
    "it allows for the appearance of phases with diagonal long - range order , phase separation , and bec .",
    "we note that when the external potentials are random , one also has to specify the average over the disorder @xcite . in the absence of external potentials ( @xmath73 )",
    "there is usually no need for a formulation in real - space since the lattice dyson equations can be written as a hilbert transform over the momenta .",
    "however , even for @xmath74 a real - space formulation is more suitable when one wants to describe phase separation or incommensurate long - range order , e.g. , stripe formation .      due to the absence of local fermion  fermion interactions the dmft action for model i is bilinear in grassmann variables",
    ". therefore they can be integrated out yielding an effective local action for the interacting bosons .",
    "the local partition function reads@xmath75e^{-s_{i_{0}}^{\\mathrm{b}}[b]+\\ln \\mathrm{det}\\left [ m_{i_{0}}^{b}\\right ] } , \\]]where the matrix elements of the operator @xmath76 in matsubara frequency space have the form @xmath77_{nm } & \\equiv & \\left [ ( \\partial _ { \\tau } -\\mu _ { f}+\\epsilon _ { i_{0}}^{f}+u_{bf}n_{i_{0}}^{b}(\\tau ) ) \\delta _ { \\tau , \\tau ^{\\prime } } + \\delta _ { i_{0}}^{f}(\\tau -\\tau ^{\\prime } ) \\right ] _ { nm }   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\left [ -i\\omega _ { n}-\\mu _ { f}+\\epsilon _ { i_{0}}^{f}+\\delta _ { i_{0}}^{f}(\\omega _ { n})\\right ] \\delta _ { nm}+\\frac{u_{bf}}{\\sqrt{\\beta } } n_{i_{0}}^{b}(\\omega _ { n}-\\omega _ { m}).\\end{aligned}\\]]apparently the local interaction between bosons and fermions @xmath19 gives rise to a complicated effective dynamics of the bosons . indeed , even if the interaction between the bosons is neglected ( @xmath78 ) the effective _ bosonic action _ is not bilinear .",
    "we will now show that this corresponds to a nontrivial effective interaction between the bosons . to this end",

    "the effective bosonic action is then found as@xmath81 where we introduced the fermionic polarization ( bubble ) function @xmath82the first - order term in @xmath19 is the hartree contribution and leads to a renormalization of the bosonic chemical potential .",
    "the second - order term describes a frequency dependent ( retarded ) local interaction between bosons due to presence of the fermions .",
    "the static component of the polarization function is equal to the fermionic local density of states @xmath83 at the fermi level , i.e. , @xmath84 .",
    "therefore the effective static interaction between the bosons is given by @xmath85 , which becomes attractive for @xmath86 .",
    "the bosonic subsystem then becomes unstable against phase separation or the formation of bosonic molecules .",
    "it is interesting to note that this effective attraction between the bosons originates from their interaction with the fermions .",
    "this is complementary to the well - known mediation of an effective attraction between fermions through the exchange of virtual bosons , e.g. , phonons .",
    "this corroborates earlier results on the effective interaction between bosons @xcite .",
    "in the case of immobile fermions , i.e. , @xmath87 ( atomic limit ) , model i reduces to a falicov - kimball like model @xcite for bose - fermi mixtures . the number of fermions on each site is then conserved and can be used to characterize many - body states .",
    "the local partition function takes the form @xmath88e^{-s_{i_{0}}^{b}-u_{bf}n_{i_{0}}^{f}\\int_{0}^{\\beta } d\\tau n_{i_{0}}^{b}(\\tau ) } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similar expressions can be derived for bosonic correlation functions .",
    "although the fermions are immobile they are still thermodynamically coupled to the bosons .",
    "this is expressed by the annealed ( rather than quenched ) average over different possible configurations of fermions on the lattice .",
    "in other words , due to the fluctuations around the microscopic equilibrium configurations the systems probes different configurations * *  * * of fermions and , for a given temperature and other external parameters , realizes the optimal configuration .",
    "in particular , on a bipartite lattice and at low enough temperatures the fermions can be long - range ordered with a checker board structure",
    ". therefore the @xmath87 ( falicov - kimball ) limit of model i differs from an anderson disorder model , where fermions are _ fixed _ at random lattice sites which are independent of temperature or other parameters .    for @xmath87 model i can have several different solutions .",
    "in particular , a sufficiently strong repulsion between bosons and fermions , @xmath19 , will cause a splitting of the bosonic band into two subbands . in this limit , and for a homogeneous system with boson density @xmath89 satisfying @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the density of fermions , a change of the interaction @xmath18 will lead to a transition from a superfluid to a mott insulator .",
    "namely , for large values of @xmath19 the lattice sites occupied by fermions are inaccessible for bosons , thereby increasing the effective density of bosons .",
    "this transition is an analog of the metal - insulator transition for fermions at non - integer densities in the presence of binary - alloy disorder @xcite .",
    "away from these special densities the ground state will be a superfluid .",
    "since the condensation temperature @xmath92 increases with the density of bosons we also expect @xmath92 to increase with increasing @xmath19 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath78 the model is equivalent to the bosonic falicov - kimball model with immobile , hard - core bosons discussed in ref.@xcite where it was shown that the transition temperature @xmath92 increases with increasing @xmath19 .",
    "in the case of bose - fermi mixtures with spinful fermions described by model ii , ( 2 ) , condensation into a state with macroscopic quantum coherence is not restricted to bosons .",
    "namely , fermions can undergo _ pair condensation _ provided @xmath93 or if the effective boson - mediated attraction dominates over the bare repulsion @xmath94 ( see below ) . to include the possibility of fermionic superfluidity ( or superconductivity in the case of charged fermions ) within the dmft we employ the nambu formalism also for fermions . to this end",
    "we define nambu spinor fermion operators @xmath95and the local fermionic one - particle green function @xmath96for bosons all relevant green functions and the bec order parameter are the same as in model i.    to derive the dmft equations for model ii in real space we again employ the cavity method and proceed as before . as a result",
    "we find the following local dmft action at site @xmath39 @xmath97where @xmath98is the action for bosons coupled to a reservoir of normal and condensed lattice bosons@xcite , @xmath99is the action for spinful fermions coupled to a fermionic reservoir , and @xmath100 is the action describing the coupling between bosons and fermions at site @xmath39 .",
    "the hybridization function matrices @xmath59 and @xmath101 are related to the local self - energies through the local dyson equations @xmath102and @xmath103the set of self - consistent dmft equations for the model ii is closed by the dyson equations for the bosonic and fermionic lattice green functions with local self - energies @xmath104 ^{-1 } ,   \\label{dyson_b_ii}\\]]and @xmath105 ^{-1}.   \\label{dyson_f_ii}\\]]these equations yield the general dmft solution for bose - fermi mixture on a lattice .",
    "they include the possibility for bosonic and fermionic superfluidity , phase separation , and the appearance of phases with diagonal long - range order .",
    "in model ii the presence of fermions with a local interaction can lead to similar effects as those discussed in connection with model i , namely to an effective attraction between bosons , and band splitting in the falicov - kimball ( atomic ) limit where @xmath87 .",
    "in particular , we will now discuss the situation where bosons influence the effective local interaction between fermions .",
    "for non - interacting bosons , @xmath78 , the local action is bilinear in the bosonic field which can therefore be integrated out analytically .",
    "we introduce a bogoliubov shift of the complex bosonic field to remove the linear term in the bosonic part of the action as @xmath106here @xmath107 and @xmath108 represent normal and condensed bosons , respectively .",
    "the local bosonic action then takes the form @xmath109where the last term describes the bose - einstein condensate , and the chemical potential for bosons is renormalized due to the interaction with the fermions by a hartree - like term . the contribution describing the interaction between bosons and fermions",

    "@xmath119 becomes negative ( attractive ) for @xmath120 .",
