    "recent observations of type ia supernovae ( sne ) have provided direct evidence that the universe is accelerating @xcite , indicating the existence of a nearly uniform dark - energy component with negative effective pressure , @xmath6 .",
    "further evidence for dark energy comes from recent cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy measurements pointing to a spatially flat , critical density universe , with @xmath7 @xcite , combined with a number of indications that the matter density @xmath8 @xcite ; the ` missing energy ' must also have sufficiently negative pressure in order to allow time for large - scale structure to form @xcite .",
    "together , these two lines of evidence indicate that dark energy composes 70% of the energy density of the universe and has equation - of - state parameter @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "determining the nature of dark energy , in particular its equation - of - state , is a critical challenge for physics and cosmology .    at present , particle physics theory provides little to no guidance about the nature of dark energy .",
    "a cosmological constant  the energy associated with the vacuum  is the simplest but not the only possibility ; in this case , @xmath10 and is time independent , and the dark energy density is spatially constant .",
    "unfortunately , theory has yet to provide a consistent description of the vacuum : the energy density of the vacuum , at most @xmath11 , is at least 57 orders of magnitude smaller than what one expects from particle physics  the cosmological constant problem @xcite . in recent years , a number of other dark energy models have been explored , from slowly rolling , ultra - light scalar fields to frustrated topological defects @xcite .",
    "these models predict that @xmath12 , that @xmath4 may evolve in time , and that there may be small spatial variations in the dark energy density ( of less than a part in @xmath13 on scales @xmath14  @xcite ) . in all models",
    "proposed thus far dark energy can be characterized by its equation - of - state @xmath4 .",
    "measuring the present value of @xmath4 and its time variation will provide crucial clues to the underlying physics of dark energy .",
    "as far as we know , dark energy can only be probed directly by cosmological measurements , although it is possible that laboratory experiments could detect other physical effects associated with dark energy , e.g. , a new long - range force arising from an ultra - light scalar field @xcite .",
    "dark energy affects the expansion rate of the universe and thereby influences cosmological observables such as the distance vs.  redshift , the linear growth of density perturbations , and the cosmological volume element ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "standard candles such as type ia supernovae offer a direct means of mapping out distance vs.  redshift ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , while the cmb anisotropy can be used to accurately determine the distance to one redshift , the last scattering epoch ( @xmath15 ) . because they measure distances at such different redshifts , the sne and cmb measurements have complementary degeneracies in the @xmath3@xmath16 and @xmath3@xmath4 planes @xcite .",
    "more recently , spergel & starkman @xcite have suggested that this complementarity argues for using supernovae at relatively low redshift , @xmath17 , to most efficiently probe dark energy . in so doing",
    ", they used a highly simplified model which did not consider a spread of sne in redshift , systematic error , possible evolution of @xmath4 , or the finite precision with which planned cmb missions can actually constrain @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    by including these `` real - world '' effects",
    ", this paper clarifies the complementarity of the cmb and sne and explores strategies for best utilizing it in sne surveys to probe the properties of dark energy .",
    "we show that dark energy - motivated supernova surveys should target sne over a broad range of redshifts out to @xmath5 , and that cmb / sne complementarity in fact strengthens the case for deep sne surveys .",
    "supernovae and the cmb anisotropy probe dark energy in different ways and at different epochs . however , both do so through the effect of dark energy on the comoving distance vs.  redshift relation , @xmath18 . for a spatially flat universe and constant @xmath4 : @xmath19 & & \\\\[0.1 cm ] ( h / h_0)^2 & = & \\omega_m(1+z)^3 + ( 1-\\omega_m)(1+z)^{3(1+w)}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the present fraction of the energy density contributed by non - relativistic matter .",
    "this relation is easily generalized to non - constant @xmath4 and a curved universe @xcite ; for notational simplicity we write this and succeeding formulae in terms of constant @xmath4 , though we generalize them to the evolving case in our analysis .",
    "it is because @xmath20 depends upon only two quantities , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , that prior information about @xmath3 ( or two independent combinations of @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) has such potential to improve the efficacy of a cosmological probe of dark energy based upon @xmath21 .",
    "cmb experiments can determine the positions and heights of the acoustic peaks in the temperature anisotropy angular power spectrum to high accuracy .",
    "the positions of the acoustic peaks in angular multipole space depend upon the physical baryon and matter densities @xmath22 and @xmath23 , on @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and to a lesser extent other cosmological parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "anisotropy measurements from the planck @xcite mission , planned for launch later in the decade , should determine the positions of the peaks to better than 0.1% ; the heights of the peaks will determine @xmath23 and @xmath22 ( and other cosmological parameters ) to roughly percent precision @xcite .",
    "together , these measurements should constrain a combination of @xmath3 and @xmath4 alone ( e.g. , @xcite ) to about 10% precision . in particular , in the vicinity of the fiducial values @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the combination @xmath26 & & \\\\[-0.15 cm ] & \\approx & \\omega_m - 0.28(1+w ) = 0.3\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] will be determined to about @xmath27 ( this result follows directly from eq .",

    "as an example of a supernova survey , the supernova / acceleration probe ( snap ) @xcite is a proposed space - based telescope to observe @xmath32 sne ia out to redshift @xmath33 , specifically designed to probe dark energy . to illustrate the essential principles for such a survey , though not all the details , we make the simplifying assumption that sne ia are nearly standard candles ( after correction for the observed correlation between light - curve decline rate and peak luminosity @xcite ) . with this assumption ,",

    "it is important to note several things from eq .",
    "first the energy flux at fixed @xmath39 depends only upon the combination @xmath40 and not upon @xmath37 and @xmath41 separately .",
    "thus , the cosmological parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be determined by measuring ratios of fluxes at different redshifts , which are independent of @xmath42 , and so @xmath42 is sometimes referred to as a nuisance parameter and can be easily marginalized over .",
    "second , since @xmath43 for @xmath44 , low - redshift supernovae can be used to determine @xmath42 , @xmath45 for example , a sample of 300 low - redshift supernovae ( e.g. , as will be targeted by the nearby sn factory @xcite ) could be used to pin down @xmath42 to a precision of @xmath46 .",
    "finally , an absolute calibration of nearby sne ia luminosities by another reliable distance indicator ( e.g. , using cepheid variables to determine distances to galaxies that host sne ia @xcite ) can determine @xmath37 ; together , @xmath37 and @xmath42 then fix the hubble constant , but we emphasize that this is not needed to probe dark energy .    for a survey of sne ia , the likelihood function for the three parameters the supernova energy flux depends upon is given by @xmath47 ^ 2\\over 2\\sigma_i^2 } \\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath48 are the redshifts of the supernovae , @xmath49 are their measured fluxes , and @xmath50 are their measurement uncertainties ( which also includes any random intrinsic spread in peak sne ia luminosities ) .    unlike the cmb , which probes the angular diameter distance at a single , fixed redshift @xmath51 , the efficacy of sne for determining @xmath4 depends upon the redshift distribution of the supernovae .",
    "as a first example , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] shows how well 3000 supernovae at a single redshift could constrain @xmath3 and @xmath4 , assuming a random flux error of 0.15 mag per supernova .",
    "because the sensitivity of the comoving distance @xmath18 to the dark energy equation - of - state ( e.g. , as measured by @xmath52 ) increases with redshift , the ellipse shrinks for sne at higher redshift @xcite .    while fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] displays important trends , we note that a realistic survey would not target sne all at one redshift .",
    "such a delta - function redshift distribution is very much less than optimal for constraining @xmath4 ( as we show in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 - 1 ] ) and would be very inefficient , since large numbers of discovered sne would have to be discarded .",
    "more importantly , a broad distribution of sne redshifts is crucial for addressing systematic / evolutionary trends in the sne population , which must be under control if sne ( or anything else ) are to be valid probes of dark energy .",
    "in addition , there is much more to studying dark energy than determining the average value of @xmath4 in the most efficient manner . constraining the time variation of",
    "the equation - of - state is critical for understanding the nature of dark energy .",
    "the cmb has no sensitivity to evolution of @xmath4 ; sne can probe time variation of @xmath4 , and a broad distribution of sne redshifts ( out to @xmath5 ) is required to achieve it , as we show below . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] we discuss strategies for the distribution of sne redshifts and results for some plausible examples .",
    "finally , determining cosmological parameters ( here @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) by two very different techniques has the virtue of providing consistency checks on the framework of dark energy as well as the friedmann - robertson - walker cosmology @xcite .",
    "some trends in the cmb / sne complementarity are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . for the fiducial model ( @xmath24 , @xmath53 ) , the planck error ellipse in the @xmath3@xmath4 plane is approximately oriented along the line @xmath54 , as indicated by eq .",
    "by contrast , the error ellipse for 3000 sne at fixed redshift has negative slope in this plane ; with increasing redshift it rotates toward @xmath55 , and its width narrows .",
    "the reason for the rotation is simple : at high redshift , matter becomes more dynamically important than dark energy , and the sne are therefore probing the matter density .",
    "while the width of the sne ellipse shrinks with increasing redshift , it becomes less complementary with the cmb ellipse .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] also makes it clear why cmb anisotropy is more complementary than the matter density information : the matter density prior , which corresponds to a vertical stripe , is less orthogonal to the sne ellipse .    to be quantitative ,",
    "it is useful to write down the joint likelihood function : @xmath56 the cmb likelihood function can be approximated as @xmath57\\nonumber\\\\[-0.3 cm ] & & \\\\[-0.2 cm ] & \\times & \\exp \\left [ -{\\displaystyle}{(\\rho_m - \\rho_{m0})^2\\over 2\\sigma_{\\rho_m}^2 } \\right]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where",

    "the accuracy of the cmb constraint in the @xmath3-@xmath4 plane depends on three factors : the experiment ( and whether polarization information is included ) , the parameter set considered , and the presence and nature of foregrounds . for comparison with sne without systematics ,",
    "we consider the cmb without foregrounds and assuming a moderate set of eight cosmological parameters and adopt the cmb constraint from ref .  @xcite . under these assumptions , @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    "are determined to 1.6% and 0.8% respectively for planck with temperature information only .",
    "comparison with sne with systematics requires the inclusion of foregrounds , and is obviously model - dependent .",
    "tegmark et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that the accuracy in all cosmological parameters of our interest degrades only slightly even in the presence of a fairly generous foreground model ( their mid model ) .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of foregrounds is expected to degrade the optimistic uncertainties computed without the systematics ( e.g. @xcite ) . to account for that",
    ", we follow ref .",
    "@xcite , where a more generous set of ten parameters is considered , but without such `` luxury parameters '' such as running of the spectral tilt and neutrino mass which were assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite . as a result",
    ", our model of the cmb with systematics constrains the quantity @xmath68 30 - 40% worse than the cmb without systematics .    as noted in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , the cmb determination of the baryon and matter densities is not directly useful for constraining dark energy : when the joint likelihood function is marginalized over the matter and baryon densities to obtain the one - dimensional probability distribution for @xmath4 , the integrations over @xmath22 and @xmath23 are trivial . on the other hand ,",
    "if we can obtain information about @xmath37 ( from non - sne distance measurements ) and @xmath40 ( from low - redshift sne ) and thereby ( or otherwise ) constrain @xmath41 , then the cmb determination of @xmath23 constrains @xmath3 as well , which would directly impact the joint determination of @xmath4 .",
    "of course , any other external determination of @xmath3 would have the same effect ; later , we will discuss how various @xmath3 priors affect the determination of @xmath4 .    assuming no information about @xmath37 ( or equivalently @xmath41 ) , the joint likelihood function becomes @xmath69 from this function , we obtain one - dimensional probability distributions for @xmath4 by marginalizing over @xmath3 .",
    "as a first case , we again assume a baseline sample of 3000 sne all at one redshift , with a random flux error of 0.15 mag per supernova . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , we show the effect of including cmb or @xmath3 information in the determination of the dark energy equation - of - state , assuming @xmath70 . if the cmb measurement of @xmath30 is assumed to be `` perfect '' ( @xmath71 ) as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , the predicted @xmath72 drops significantly with increasing redshift and continues to do so out to @xmath73 .",
    "the effect of a `` perfect '' matter density prior ( @xmath74 ) is similar .",
    "this qualitative behavior can be understood by referring to fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] and considering the intersection of the cmb line ( now an infinitely thin ellipse ) with the sne ellipses or of a vertical line ( fixed @xmath3 ) with the sne ellipses .",
    "the decreasing width of the sne ellipses wins out over the decreasing complementarity at higher redshift .",
    "the qualitative behavior changes , however , when finite precision for the cmb and matter density measurements is taken into account ; as examples , for the cmb we use the projected planck accuracy discussed above , and for the matter density we assume @xmath75 . not only is the uncertainty @xmath72 larger in these cases , but it now reaches a minimum at @xmath76 and rises slightly at higher redshift . for finite widths of the matter density or cmb priors , the decreasing complementarity now wins out over the decreasing width of the sne ellipse with increasing redshift .",
    "thus far , we have not allowed for systematic error in measuring the supernova flux at a given redshift .",
    "this means that by measuring a large number of supernovae at a given redshift , the flux and thereby @xmath18 can be determined to arbitrarily high accuracy .",
    "in reality , the presence of residual systematic uncertainty is likely to impose a floor to improvement . as a simple model for irreducible systematic error in the sne measurements",

    "this model penalizes observing large numbers of sne at the same redshift since the irreducible error adds to the poisson error : one reaches diminishing returns for @xmath79 , at which point the error is only @xmath80% larger than its asymptotic value . while this model is certainly simplistic , it captures in a straightforward way the essential point : increasing the number of sne can not decrease the measured error in @xmath81 to arbitrarily small values @xcite .",

    "[ sec:2 ] , realistic survey would not target supernovae all at a single redshift , as assumed up to now .",
    "moreover , since the orientation of the sn error ellipse in the @xmath3@xmath4 plane rotates with @xmath34 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) , a spread of sne redshifts helps break the degeneracy between @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in the next section ,",
    "we consider more realistic strategies for the supernova redshift distribution to optimally probe dark energy .",
    "the issue of optimal strategies for determining dark energy properties using sne in a realistic experiment has been addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite . here , we extend these results to incorporate cmb anisotropy and other measurements .",
    "the optimization problem can be stated as follows : we have three cosmological parameters ( @xmath42 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ; later we will add a fourth , @xmath1 ) ; we have `` prior information '' ( from the cmb anisotropy and/or an independent determination of @xmath3 ) ; and we wish to determine the redshift distribution of the sne which minimizes the error on @xmath4 , with the constraint that they are confined to the interval @xmath86 $ ] . for now , we assume that the total number of observed sne is held fixed , and we do not include systematic error in the sne measurements . later we will relax both of these assumptions .",
    "huterer & turner @xcite showed that for the @xmath87-parameter problem with no priors , the optimal redshift distribution comprises @xmath87 delta functions , with one at @xmath88 , one at @xmath89 , and the others in between .",
    "the amplitudes of the delta functions and their positions relative to @xmath89 vary little with the value of @xmath90 . unless otherwise noted . ] adding a `` strong '' prior on one , or a combination , of the three parameters reduces the number of delta functions by one , adding two `` strong '' priors reduces the number of delta functions by two , and so on . a `` strong '' prior is one that constrains one , or a combination , of the three parameters better than the sne measurements alone would .",
    "in actuality , this is a continuous process , with the amplitude of one of the delta functions going to zero as the quality of the prior improves .",
    "further , for smaller @xmath89 it is easier to have a `` strong '' prior , since the sne constrain the parameters less well .    for illustration",
    "we consider a survey of about 3000 sne with survey depth @xmath91 .",
    "these choices are motivated by the proposed snap survey @xcite and thus provide a useful benchmark ( snap should obtain 3000 type ia sne in about two years of observations ) .",

    "indeed , the nearby sn factory redshift distribution is strongly peaked at @xmath99 , in part for this reason .",
    "we could have simply imposed a prior on @xmath42 instead of including this portion of the redshift distribution .    finally , it is important to consider how much improvement the optimal redshift distribution actually provides compared to a uniform distribution or the snap+sn factory distribution : for the cases shown in figs .",

    "moreover , mapping the polarization anisotropy on large angular scales  where it helps determine @xmath4 indirectly , by imposing an upper limit to the ionization optical depth @xmath126  will be difficult in the presence of polarized synchrotron radiation from the galaxy .",
    "finally , we mention that while polarization measurements also have the potential to improve the planck determination of @xmath30 ( by about 50% ) ,",
    "this only improves the joint sne / cmb determination of @xmath4 by about 15% .",
    "the reason is simple : it is the width of the sne error ellipse that controls @xmath72 .      in the analysis",
    "so far , we have assumed a fixed total number of observed supernovae , @xmath127 .",
    "however , the resources required to discover and follow up a supernova depend in general upon its redshift .",
    "thus , an important but more complicated problem involves the optimization of the determination of dark energy parameters with fixed total resources . actually determining what these fixed resources are ( e.g. , discovery time , follow - up time , spectroscopy time ) and how much each supernova ` costs ' is beyond the scope of this paper ( relevant ongoing studies can be found at @xcite ) .",
    "we note that these costs will depend in detail upon a variety of technical factors : telescope aperture , pixel size and number , ccd quantum efficiency , sky brightness , atmospheric seeing ( for ground - based observations ) , required signal to noise , etc .    as a highly simplified model ,",
    "let the normalized cost of each supernova observed at redshift @xmath34 be @xmath128 , so that the total cost of a survey that follows up @xmath87 supernovae is @xmath129 .",
    "the problem is to find the optimal sne redshift distribution for fixed total resources ( total cost ) @xmath130 . for snap ,",
    "the observing time cost for spectroscopy or photometry per supernova is estimated to scale as @xmath131 for fixed signal to noise @xcite . in the case of wide field , multiplexing photometry that snap",
    "is designed for , simultaneously discovering and following up supernovae by repeatedly sweeping the same field could reduce this by a large factor . to span the plausible range of cost functions ,",
    "we show results for @xmath132 , and 6 .",
    "to fix the total resources @xmath130 , we assume that there are sufficient resources to carry out a survey of 3112 sne with the fiducial snap + sn factory redshift distribution shown , e.g. , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "that is , for a given value of @xmath133 , we fix @xmath130 by computing the total cost of the fiducial snap + sn factory redshift distribution .",
    "then we find the sn redshift distribution that minimizes @xmath72 within the resource constraint , i.e. , for the same value of @xmath130 .",
    "if we place no upper bound on the number of sne per redshift bin , the number of sne at low redshifts would be driven to huge values as @xmath133 is increased .",
    "clearly a distribution with many thousands of sne in any redshift bin is not experimentally realistic , and the systematic error makes this an unwise choice : the gains in terms of reduced @xmath72 are negligible once the number of sne per bin goes much above 100 . we therefore impose the further constraint that the number of sne per redshift bin of width 0.25 not exceed ( a very generous ) 1000 .    the results for @xmath132 , and",
    "6 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] and [ fig : fig11 ] , again for @xmath91 , the same model for irreducible systematic error as above , and either no prior from the cmb ( figs .",
    "[ fig : fig10]a ,  [ fig : fig11]a ) or the planck prior ( figs .  [",
    "fig : fig10]b ,  [ fig : fig11]b ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] , we assume constant @xmath4 , while in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig11 ] @xmath4 can evolve .",
    "we note that the performance of the optimal distribution in minimizing @xmath72 ( or @xmath106 ) is only 2 to 10% better than the snap + sn factory distribution in all cases .",
    "consider first the constant @xmath4 case .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig10 ] shows that , as @xmath133 increases , sne start filling up the lower redshift bins to the maximum allowed number ; this continues until the resource limit is reached . while this is strictly true for the planck prior , with no prior a significant fraction of sne",
    "remain in the highest redshift bin .",
    "this behavior can be understood simply : without any priors , the high redshift sne are crucial for breaking the degeneracy between @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig7 ] ) ; the addition of the planck prior partially breaks this degeneracy , and the number of sne in the highest redshift bin therefore decreases .",
    "the case of evolving @xmath4 is qualitatively similar , with one important difference : the high-@xmath34 subsample of sne is always present in the optimal distribution , regardless of the prior or the value of @xmath133 . as fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11 ] shows , the highest redshift bin always has a significant number of sne ( @xmath134 ) , even for @xmath135 , when their cost is large .    although the exact optimal distribution for a given value of @xmath133 , and the corresponding values of @xmath72 and @xmath106 , will depend in practice on details of the optimization  the number of redshift bins and the maximum number of sne allowed per bin  some clear trends emerge from this analysis .",
    "while the lower redshift bins become relatively more populated in the optimal distributions ( reflecting the lower cost of low - redshift sne ) , the importance of high redshift supernovae remains : in _ all _ cases , at least 800 sne are at redshifts @xmath136 .",
    "for the constant @xmath4 case with no planck prior , or for evolving @xmath4 regardless of prior , these high - redshift sne are crucial to making the error on @xmath4 small enough to be useful .",
    "clearly we have just scratched the surface with regard to resource - limited optimization ; to proceed further , one would need a much more quantitative description of the resources available and the systematics .",
    "unraveling the nature of dark energy is one of the outstanding challenges in physics and astronomy .",
    "determining its properties is critical to understanding the universe and its destiny and may shed light on the fundamental nature of the quantum vacuum and perhaps even of space - time .",
    "type ia supernovae and cmb anisotropy can both probe the dark energy equation - of - state @xmath4 , and we have explored in detail the synergy between the two . with the map mission in progress , the planck mission slated for launch in 2007 , and the design of dedicated sn surveys now underway , such a study is very timely .",
    "cmb anisotropy alone can not tightly constrain the properties of dark energy because of a strong degeneracy between the average equation - of - state and the matter density .",
    "sne can probe @xmath4 with a precision that improves significantly with knowledge of the matter density , because @xmath20 depends only upon @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "a key result of this paper is that cmb anisotropy measurements by the upcoming planck mission have even more potential for improving the ability of sne to probe dark energy .",
    "the reason is simple : in the @xmath3@xmath4 plane ( fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) , the cmb constraint is more complementary to the sne constraint than is determination of @xmath3 .    compared to the matter density prior @xmath75 , planck cmb data reduce the predicted error @xmath72 ( under the assumption of constant @xmath4 ) by about a factor of two ( fig .  [",
    "fig : fig7 ] ) . in probing possible variation of @xmath4 with redshift ,",
    "the planck prior is also significantly better than the same matter density prior ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] ) . given the concern expressed by some ( e.g. , @xcite ) that a precise measurement of the matter density independent of dark energy properties may be difficult ,",
    "this is good news . on the other hand , we find that even if map can successfully measure polarization on large scales , its potential for complementarity with sne falls short of that for planck and is not as good as the @xmath137 matter density prior .",
    "we have also explored how the sne determination of the dark energy equation - of - state , with or without prior information from the cmb or the matter density , depends upon the redshift distribution of the survey , including the effects of systematic error and a realistic spread of sne redshifts . for either constant or evolving @xmath4 , the optimal strategy calls for significant numbers of sne above redshift @xmath84 . for the constant @xmath4 case with no planck prior , or for evolving @xmath4 regardless of prior , these high - redshift sne are necessary for achieving @xmath138 .",
    "observing substantial numbers of sne at these high redshifts also provides the only hope of probing time evolution of the equation - of - state with reasonable precision .",
    "moreover , the improvement in @xmath139 continues to high redshift : @xmath139 falls by more than a factor of two when @xmath89 increases from @xmath140 to @xmath141 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] ) .",
    "since we currently have no prior information about ( or consensus physical models which significantly constrain ) the time variation of @xmath4 , the design of a sne survey aimed at probing dark energy should take into account the possibility that @xmath4 evolves .",
    "these conclusions about the need for high - redshift supernovae do not change significantly if we consider a hypothetical survey for which resources are constrained and a redshift - dependent cost is assigned to each supernova .",
    "@xcite raised the question whether a shallow sne survey is better than a deep one in determining the dark energy equation - of - state , given prior knowledge from the cmb .",
    "our results indicate that it is not , once the sne and cmb experiments are realistically modelled . on the contrary ,",
    "cmb / sne complementarity strengthens the case for a deep sne survey that extends to redshift @xmath5 .",
