    "one of the deepest mysteries of the standard model concerns the nature and origin of neutrino masses .",
    "one can easily obtain neutrino masses in the standard model by simply adding right - handed neutrinos and generate their masses through the conventional higgs mechanism .",
    "however , this requires extraordinarily small yukawa couplings .",
    "one can generate small masses through the seesaw mechanism , but this requires a very large mass scale for the right - handed neutrino .",
    "an alternative model for small dirac neutrino masses was proposed originally by wang et al.@xcite and further developed by gabriel and nandi@xcite . in this model , a second higgs doublet",
    "is added to the standard model , and a discrete symmetry couples the first doublet to the standard model fermions and the second to the right handed neutrinos . by choosing a vev for the second doublet to be extremely small , of o(0.1 ) ev",
    ", one obtains small neutrino masses instead of extremely small yukawa couplings .",
    "the model contains a very light real scalar corresponding to the small vev .    of course , the model must be very fine - tuned in order to get such a small vev .",
    "this makes the theory quite unnatural , and certainly not more natural than simply choosing extremely small yukawa couplings .",
    "however , it is a logical alternative , and is no more fine - tuned than non - supersymmetric grand unified theories . a possible mechanism for generating a small vev through higher dimensional operators and neutrino condensation is discussed in ref .",
    "we will not be concerned with the precise mechanism of generation of the small vev in this work .    in this brief report , we study the phenomenology of the low energy effective theory of the model , concentrating on energies well below the electron mass . in this effective theory ,",
    "the weak interactions , all charged fermions and the heavier scalar fields are all integrated out .",
    "the only remaining fields are the three dirac neutrinos and a single real scalar , as well as massless gauge bosons .",
    "the lagrangian for the model is simply @xmath0    the vacuum expectation of @xmath1 , @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 , and the mass matrix of the neutrinos is then @xmath4 . diagonalizing",
    "the neutrino mass matrix automatically diagonalizes the yukawa interactions .",
    "since the largest @xmath5 in the neutrino sector @xcite is approximately @xmath6 , and since the yukawa coupling can not be too much larger than @xmath7 , one expects @xmath2 to be @xmath8 ev .",
    "note that this lagrangian is obtained by integrating out the heavy fields from the original lagrangian of the two - higgs - doublet model discussed above , so the couplings to @xmath9 bosons , electrons and other standard model particles are suppressed by factors of @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath11 s are thus effectively gauge singlets in the effective theory .",
    "some bounds on these parameters can be obtained by considering unitarity , by requiring that the theory be stable and perturbative from the ev scale to the scale at which the effective theory is no longer valid and that the contribution to the z width be phenomenologically acceptable .",
    "the unitarity bound is obtained by expanding the matrix element in @xmath12 in partial waves , and using the optical theorem to show that the coefficients in the partial wave expansion are bounded by @xmath13 .",
    "the strongest bound comes from the @xmath14 partial wave , and gives @xmath15 .    .",
    "as discussed in section 3 , above the critical temperature , the vev of @xmath1 vanishes and neutrinos become massless.,title=\"fig:\",width=453,height=566 ] -3 cm    since this is an effective theory which must be valid from the sub - ev scale to the electron mass scale , the potential must be bounded and perturbative throughout that range .",
    "the rges for the above potential are given by @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the renormalization scale and one integrates from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "the choice of @xmath21 to cut off the integration is , of course , somewhat arbitrary ; the exact cutoff depends on the ultraviolet completion of the theory .",
    "integrating these equations leads to the bounds in figure 1 .",
    "a given point in the allowed region corresponds to allowed values of the neutrino mass and the scalar mass .",
    "one can consider the effects of the additional states on the invisible z - width .",
    "the processes @xmath22 and @xmath23 were discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and shown to be negligible .",
    "one can also consider @xmath24 , which can occur at one - loop through @xmath1 exchange .",
    "the effective number of neutrinos depends on the details of the theory in the ultraviolet ; using a cutoff of @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) gev gives @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "given that the experimental error in the effective number of neutrinos@xcite is @xmath29 , this gives no bound in the allowed region of figure 1 .",
    "in addition , the effects of the new light states on nucleosynthesis are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and shown to be acceptable .",
    "a clear prediction of this model is that there will be a contribution to the invisible decay of the standard model higgs boson ( @xmath30 ) , whose size depends sensitively on the value of the scalar self - couplings .",
    "in addition , effects of the charged higgs and pseudoscalar ( which depend , of course , on the ultraviolet completion of the model ) are discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "other than the result in figure 1 , most of the above is discussed in refs .",
    "they also point out that the mixing between the light @xmath1 field and all heavy fields is @xmath31 , and thus contributions to electroweak precision measurements , such as the @xmath32 parameter , are negligible . in this report",
    ", we wish to point out some additional effects that have not yet been discussed , and which can have dramatic implications .",
    "one of surprising consequences of the potential in equation 1 are the effects of finite temperature . as in the standard model , at high temperature",
    "a quadratic term @xmath33 is added , resulting in @xmath34 at sufficiently high temperature .",
    "the inclusion of high temperature terms is straightforward @xcite , and the critical temperature at which the vev of @xmath1 vanishes is @xmath35 in figure 1 , we have plotted the value of @xmath36 for various points in the @xmath37 plane .",
    "one can see that @xmath38 for all of the allowed parameter space .    for the normal hierarchy , the mass of the heaviest neutrino is @xmath39 ev , and thus @xmath2 is between @xmath40 and @xmath41 ev for most of the allowed parameter space .",
    "this means that the critical temperature will be between @xmath39 ev and @xmath42 ev . the rather surprising result is that the vev of @xmath1 , and thus all neutrino masses , will vanish at temperatures between @xmath43 and @xmath44 kelvin !",
    "this would mean that neutrino oscillations vanish at relatively low temperatures .",
    "it is important to remember , however , that  temperature \" refers to the _ neutrino _ temperature ( or , equivalently , the @xmath1 temperature ) , not the photon temperature . in the center of the sun , for example",
    ", the temperature of the photons , electrons and hadrons is typically several million kelvin .",
    "however , these states have extremely weak interactions with the @xmath11 and @xmath1 fields , and thus will not  heat \" up the @xmath1 field quickly . since the coupling is typically of the order of @xmath45 @xcite",
    ", the equilibrium time will be extremely long , of @xmath46 times longer than typical weak scale decays .",
    "the motion of the sun through the background @xmath1 field will be too rapid for any equilibration to take place .",
    "thus solar neutrinos will still oscillate , as will neutrinos generated in accelerator experiments .",
    "there is an additional effect of this model .",
    "neutrinos will be able to interact with each other via exchange of a @xmath1 .",
    "this will be relatively strong , and on distance scales smaller than the compton wavelength of the @xmath1 will be as strong as a typical electromagnetic interaction .",
    "the compton wavelenghth of the @xmath1 will typically be of o(10 ) microns .",
    "thus neutrinos will interact with electromagnetic strength on distance scales smaller than o(10 ) microns !",
    "is there any way to detect this ?",
    "a typical neutrino beam is much larger than this distance , so there would not be any substantial focusing from a pinch effect , and focusing on scales smaller than this does not appear to be detectable .",
    "where could these effects be seen ? the only times that neutrinos are in equilibrium at a high temperature are during the big bang and in supernovae .",
    "a small neutrino mass in the big bang could have an effect on the relic neutrino density , but the relic neutrinos have not been detected .",
    "thus , the only hope of seeing the vanishing of neutrino masses at high temperature is in supernovae .",
    "what about the strong interaction between neutrinos ( which exists even at low temperatures ) ?",
    "the @xmath1 field could be emitted copiously in stars , of course .",
    "however , the @xmath1 field would likely be heavier than some of the neutrinos , and would thus decay into them .",
    "a rough estimate shows that they would not appreciably escape from stars .",
    "again , the only possible way to measure this effect is in supernovae .",
    "there have been hundreds of studies of supernovae neutrinos in the past decade .",
    "a review with a large number of references can be found in @xcite and a recent phd thesis by esteban - pretel with a very clear discussion of neutrino energies and spectra is in ref .",
    "an important effect that was neglected until fairly recently is the msw - type collective effect with other neutrinos in the neutrinosphere ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "there are three energy distributions of neutrinos in a supernova  the @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 energy distributions , where @xmath49 refers to muon and tau neutrinos and antineutrinos ( which will be the same ) .",
    "one expects the average energies , @xmath50 , to differ somewhat , with @xmath51 , and the energy distributions will differ somewhat from a fermi - dirac distribution ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of the difference distributions used ) .",
    "although current detectors would only be sensitive to @xmath48 , future detectors of a galactic supernova may be sensitive to all of the distributions @xcite .    in this model",
    ", the biggest effect will be the strong interactions between neutrinos .",
    "the @xmath1 will mediate @xmath52 interactions with electromagnetic strength .",
    "this will result in the complete equilibration of all of the neutrino species , resulting in pure fermi - dirac distributions of identical temperatures . as a result ,",
    "issues of neutrino oscillations in the neutrinosphere and collective effects will be completely washed out .",
    "a prediction of this model is that the neutrino energies and distributions of the various neutrino and antineutrino species will be identical , in sharp contrast to the standard picture .",
    "note that the effect discussed earlier of the neutrinos becoming massless at high temperature can thus not be detected .",
    "in a neutrinophilic two - higgs - doublet model , the effective low - energy theory below the mev scale consists of three dirac neutrinos and a light scalar . this may be the low - energy limit of other models as well .",
    "we have studied the allowed parameter - space of the model , and have found two remarkable properties .",
    "neutrinos will become absolutely massless at temperatures above a few thousand kelvin , and there will be electromagnetic - strength interactions between neutrinos at distance scales below o(10 ) microns .",
    "however , the only phenomenological evidence for such properties would occur in the detection of neutrinos from a galactic supernova , in which the model predicts ( in contrast to the standard picture ) that all of the neutrino species will have fermi - dirac distributions of identical temperatures .",
    "this would be true of any model with extremely strong neutrino - neutrino interactions .",
