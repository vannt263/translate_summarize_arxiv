    "entanglement@xcite is one of the important concepts from fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics and practical aspect of quantum information processing .",
    "as shown for last two decades it plays a crucial role in quantum teleportation@xcite , superdense coding@xcite , quantum cloning@xcite , and quantum cryptography@xcite .",
    "it is also quantum entanglement , which makes the quantum computer outperform the classical one@xcite .",
    "quantum mechanics is a physics , which is valid for ideally closed system .",
    "however , real physical systems inevitably interact with their surroundings .",
    "thus , it is important to study how the environment modifies the dynamics of given physical system .",
    "there are two different tools for describing the evolution of open quantum system : quantum operation formalism@xcite and master equation approach@xcite .",
    "both tools have their own merits .",
    "since it is known that quantum system loses quantum properties by contacting the environment@xcite , we expect that the degradation of entanglement occurs@xcite .",
    "sometimes entanglement exhibits an exponential decay in time by successive halves .",
    "sometimes , however , the entanglement sudden death ( esd ) occurs when the entangled multipartite quantum system is embedded in markovian environments@xcite .",
    "this means that the entanglement is completely disentangled at finite times .",
    "this esd phenomenon has been revealed experimentally@xcite .",
    "when the esd occurs , it is natural to ask where the lost entanglement goes .",
    "it was found that when the entanglement of given quantum system suddenly disappears , the reservoir entanglement suddenly appears , which is called entanglement sudden birth ( esb ) @xcite .",
    "since we do not consider the degrees of freedom for the environment , we do not examine the esb phenomenon in this paper .",
    "the dynamics of entanglement was also examined when the physical system is embedded in non - markovian environment@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that there is a revival of entanglement after a finite period of time of its complete disappearance .",
    "this is mainly due to the memory effect of the non - markovian environment .",
    "this phenomenon was shown in ref.@xcite by making use of the two qubit system and concurrence@xcite as a bipartite entanglement measure .",
    "subsequently , many works have been done to quantify the non - markovianity@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the entanglement dynamics when the qubit system interacts with the markovian or non - markovian environment .",
    "so far this issue was investigated by making use of the bipartite system .",
    "recently , the tripartite entanglement dynamics was also explored in ref.@xcite numerically .",
    "since entanglement is an important physical resource in the quantum information processing , it is important to control the entanglement dynamics when the environment is present . in order to control the entanglement it is crucial to derive the entanglement analytically in the entire range of time .",
    "for example , analytic derivation for the bipartite entanglement dynamics enables us to explore the entanglement invariants@xcite .",
    "it is also possible to discuss the robustness or fragility issue against the environment by exploiting the analytical results .",
    "thus , we will explore the tripartite entanglement dynamics in this paper on the analytical ground . for simplicity",
    ", we choose the physical setting , i.e. there is no interaction between qubit and each qubit interacts with its own reservoir .",
    "we will compute the entanglement at arbitrary time for three - types of initial greenberger - horne - zeilinger(ghz ) states@xcite and for two types of initial w - states@xcite in the presence of the markovian or non - markovian environment .",
    "typical tripartite entanglement measures are residual entanglement@xcite and @xmath0-tangle@xcite . for three - qubit pure state @xmath1",
    "the residual entanglement @xmath2 becomes @xmath3 where @xmath4 thus , the residual entanglement of any three - qubit pure state can be computed by making use of eq .",
    "( [ residual-1 ] ) .",
    "although the residual entanglement can detect the ghz - type entanglement , it can not detect the w - type entanglement : @xmath5 where @xmath6    for mixed states the residual entanglement is defined by a convex - roof method@xcite as follows : @xmath7 where the minimum is taken over all possible ensembles of pure states .",
    "the pure state ensemble corresponding to the minimum @xmath2 is called the optimal decomposition .",
    "it is in general difficult to derive the optimal decomposition for arbitrary mixed states .",
    "hence , analytic computation of the residual entanglement can be done for rare cases@xcite .",
    "furthermore , recently , three - tangle three - tangle and @xmath8 residual entanglement . ] @xmath9 of the whole ghz - symmetric states@xcite was explicitly computed@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-tangle defined in ref.@xcite is easier for analytic computation than the residual entanglement ( or three tangle ) because it does not rely on the convex - roof method .",
    "the @xmath0-tangle is defined in terms of the global negativities  @xcite . for a three - qubit state @xmath10",
    "they are given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 , and the superscripts @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 represent the partial transposes of @xmath10 with respect to the qubits @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "then , the @xmath0-tangle is defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 the remarkable property of the @xmath0-tangle is that it can detect not only the ghz - type entanglement but also the w - type entanglement : @xmath21    as commented earlier we will examine the tripartite entanglement dynamics of the three - qubit states in the presence of the markovian or non - markovian environment .",
    "we will adopt the @xmath0-tangle as an entanglement measure for analytic computation as much as possible . in section",
    "ii we consider how the three - qubit initial state is evolved when each qubit interacts with its own markovian or non - markovian environment@xcite . in section iii",
    "we explore the entanglement dynamics of three ghz - type initial states .",
    "the initial states are local unitary ( lu ) with each other .",
    "thus , their entanglement are the same initially . furthermore , if the parameters are appropriately chosen , they all have ghz - symmetry , i.e. they are invariant under ( i ) qubit permutation ( ii ) simultaneous three - qubit flips ( iii ) qubit rotations about the @xmath22-axis . however , this symmetry is broken due to the environment effect . as a result ,",
    "their entanglement dynamics are different with each other . in section",
    "iv we examine the entanglement dynamics of two w - type initial states .",
    "they are also lu to each other .",
    "however , the dynamics is also different because of the environment effect . in section v a brief conclusion is given .",
    "we consider three - qubit system , each of which interacts only and independently with its local environment .",
    "we assume that the dynamics of single qubit is governed by hamiltonian @xmath23 where @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian-2 ] ) @xmath25 is a transition frequency of the two - level system ( qubit ) , and @xmath26 are the raising and lowering operators .",

    "this means that the schrdinger equation ( [ schrodinger-1 ] ) can be formally solved if @xmath34 is given .",
    "then , the reduced state of the single qubit @xmath35 is given by@xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 denotes the partial trace over the environment .",

    "<S> we study on the tripartite entanglement dynamics when each party is initially entangled with other parties , but they locally interact with their own markovian or non - markovian environment . </S>",

    "<S> the corresponding @xmath0-tangles , one of the tripartite entanglement measure , are analytically computed at arbitrary time . for markovian case while the tripartite entanglement for type i exhibits an entanglement sudden death , the dynamics for the remaining cases decays normally in time with the half - life rule . for non - markovian case </S>",
    "<S> the revival phenomenon of entanglement occurs after complete disappearance of entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider two w - type initial states . for both cases the @xmath0-tangles are analytically derived . </S>",
