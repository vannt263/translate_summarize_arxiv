    "recently , a lot of interest has grown around the possibility of applying string inspired techniques to the non - perturbative regime of qcd .",
    "the starting point is the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , a conjectured duality between a maximally supersymmetric strongly coupled conformal field theory and the supergravity limit of type  iib string theory , which involves theories different from qcd .",
    "further developments @xcite have tried to apply the correspondence to qcd , induced by the evidence of the existence of a window of energy in which qcd shows an approximate conformal behaviour @xcite .",
    "these developments have taken different directions .",
    "the framework through which i move here is the so - called soft  wall model of ads / qcd @xcite , a phenomenological model originally built to holographically describe chiral symmetry breaking and then adapted to several strong interaction processes . for a list of other approaches the reader can refer to @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "i discuss the scalar glueball sector and how the spectrum and the two - point correlation function are represented in the soft wall model .",
    "then , i comment on the results , comparing them with current phenomenology and lattice data .",
    "the considered model is defined in a @xmath0 curved space ( the bulk ) with metric : @xmath1 with @xmath2 ; @xmath3 is the ads curvature radius , and the coordinate @xmath4 runs in the range @xmath5 .",
    "qcd is supposed to live on the boundary @xmath6 , where the element @xmath7 describes a flat minkowski space .",
    "in addition to the ads metric , the model is characterized by the presence of a background dilaton field : @xmath8 exponentially coupled to the fields , whose functional form is chosen in such a way to have linear regge trajectories for light vector mesons @xcite ; @xmath9 is a dimensionful parameter setting the scale of qcd quantities and it is of @xmath10 .",
    "it is the responsible of the breaking of conformal symmetry and it is fixed by the experimental slope of the rho mesons trajectory .",
    "@xmath11 glueballs can be described in qcd by the dimension four operator @xmath12 $ ] . in the five dimensional theory its dual field is a massless scalar @xmath13 @xcite , whose action is given by : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a parameter introduced to give the correct dimension to the action .",
    "the ads / cft dictionary states that this action is equivalent to the qcd partition function , in which the source of @xmath16 is the boundary value @xmath17 of the field @xmath13 .",
    "the following relation can be written : @xmath18 where the function @xmath19 is called bulk - to - boundary propagator , since it links the fields in the bulk with the sources on the boundary .",
    "it is possible to obtain qcd correlation functions functionally deriving the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to @xmath17 .",
    "the two - point function obtained in this way is , in the limit @xmath20 @xcite : @xmath21+\\non\\\\    & & + q^2\\left[-\\fr{\\n^2}{2}+\\fr{c^2}{4}\\left(1 - 4\\g_e+2\\ln4 - 2\\ln(q^2/\\n^2)\\right)\\right]+\\\\    & & -\\fr{5c^4}{6}+\\fr{2c^6}{3q^2}+{\\cal    o}\\left(\\fr{1}{q^4}\\right)\\biggr\\}\\;\\;,\\non\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to be compared with the qcd result @xcite : @xmath22 matching ( [ piads ] ) with ( [ piqcd ] ) ( @xmath23 ) one gets the fully analytic form of the correlator . by casting it in the form : @xmath24 it is possible to find the poles @xmath25 and the related residues @xmath26 , corresponding to the mass spectrum and the decay constants of the scalar glueballs . the results for the lowest lying state are :        another point is that in the large @xmath31 expansion there is a dimension  two condensate , absent in qcd since there are no ways to construct scalar local gauge invariant quantities with that dimension @xcite .",
