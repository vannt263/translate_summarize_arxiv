    "assume that the coefficients @xmath17 and @xmath18 are bounded below @xmath19 for almost all @xmath20 .",
    "the _ a posteriori _ error estimation for the conforming finite element approximation to the @xmath0 problem in   has been studied recently by several researchers .",
    "several types of _ a posteriori _ error estimators have been introduced and analyzed .",
    "these include residual - based estimators and the corresponding convergence analysis ( explicit @xcite , and implicit @xcite ) , equilibrated estimators @xcite , and recovery - based estimators @xcite .",
    "there are four types of errors in the explicit residual - based estimator ( see @xcite ) .",
    "two of them are standard , i.e. , the element residual , and the interelement face jump induced by the discrepancy induced by integration by parts associated with the original equation in .",
    "the other two are also the element residual and the interelement face jump , but associated with the divergence of the original equation : @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the divergence operator .",
    "these two quantities measure how good the approximation is in the kernel space of the curl operator .",
    "recently , the idea of the robust recovery estimator explored in @xcite for the diffusion interface problem has been extended to the @xmath0 interface problem in @xcite .",
    "instead of recovering two quantities in the continuous polynomial spaces like the extension of the popular zienkiewicz - zhu ( zz ) error estimator in @xcite , two quantities related to @xmath23 and @xmath24 are recovered in the respective @xmath0- and @xmath25-conforming finite element spaces .",
    "the resulting estimator consists of four terms similar to the residual estimator in the pioneering work @xcite on this topic by beck , hiptmair , hoppe , and wohlmuth : two of them measure the face jumps of the tangential components and the normal component of the numerical approximations to @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , and the other two are element residuals of the recovery type .",
    "all existing a posteriori error estimators for the @xmath0 problem assume that the right - hand side @xmath10 is in @xmath25 or divergence free .",
    "this assumption does not hold in many applications ( e.g. the implicit marching scheme mentioned in @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , two terms of the estimators are associated with the divergence of the original equation . in the proof , these two terms come to existence up after performing the integration by parts for the irrotational gradient part of the error , which lies in the kernel of the curl operator .",
    "one of the key technical tools , a helmholtz decomposition , used in this proving mechanism , relies on @xmath10 being in @xmath25 , and fails if @xmath26 . in @xcite , the assumption that @xmath27 is weakened to @xmath10 being in the piecewise @xmath25 space with respect to the triangulation , at the same time",
    ", the divergence residual and norm jump are modified to incorporate this relaxation .",
    "another drawback of using helmholtz decomposition on the error is that it introduces the assumption of the coefficients quasi - monotonicity into the proof pipeline .",
    "an interpolant with a coefficient independent stability bound is impossible to construct in a `` checkerboard '' scenario ( see @xcite for diffusion case , and @xcite for @xmath0 case ) . to gain certain robustness for the error estimator in the proof",
    ", one has to assume the coefficients distribution is quasi - monotone .",
    "however , in an earlier work of chen , xu , and zou ( @xcite ) , it is shown that numerically this quasi - monotonicy assumption is more of an artifact introduced by the proof pipeline , at least for the irrotational vector fields . as a result",
    ", we conjecture that the divergence related terms should not be part of an estimator if it is appropriately constructed . in section [ sec : numex ] , some numerical justifications are presented to show the unnecessity of including the divergence related terms .    the pioneering work in using the dual problems for a posteriori error estimation dates back to @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "oden , demkowicz , rachowicz , and westermann studied the a posteriori error estimation through duality for the diffusion - reaction problem .",
    "the finite element approximation to a dual problem is used to estimate the error for the original primal problem ( diffusion - reaction ) .",
    "the result shares the same form to the prague - synge identity ( @xcite ) for diffusion - reaction problem .",
    "the method presented in this paper may be viewed as an extension of the duality method in @xcite to the @xmath0 interface problem . the auxiliary magnetizing field introduced in section [ sec : aux",
    "] is the dual variable resembling the flux variable in @xcite .",
    "the connection is illustrated in details in section [ sec : dual ] .",
    "later , repin ( @xcite ) proposes a functional type a posteriori error estimator of @xmath0 problem , which can be viewed as an extension of the general approach in @xcite .",
    "repin et al ( @xcite ) improve the estimate by assuming that the data @xmath10 is divergence free and the finite element approximation is in @xmath25 . in @xcite ,",
    "the upper bound is established through integration by parts by introducing an auxiliary variable in an integral identity for @xmath0 .",
    "an auxiliary variable is recovered by globally solving an @xmath0 finite element approximation problem and is used in the error estimator . for the global lower bound",
    ", the error equation is solved globally in an @xmath0 conforming finite element space .",
    "then the solution is inserted into the functional as the error estimator of which the maximizer corresponds to the solution to the error equation .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop a novel a posteriori error estimator for the conforming finite element approximation to the @xmath0 problem in ( [ eq : pb - ef - weak ] ) that overcomes the above drawbacks of the existing estimators , e.g. the helmholtz decomposition proof mechanism , restricted by the assumption that @xmath28 or divergence free , which brings in the divergence related terms .",
    "specifically , the estimator studied in this paper is of the recovery type , requires the right - hand side merely having a regularity of @xmath1 , and has only two terms that measure the element residual and the tangential face jump of the original equation .",
    "based on the current approximation to the primary variable @xmath7 ( the electric field ) , an auxiliary variable @xmath29 ( the magnetizing field ) is recovered by approximating a similar auxiliary @xmath0 problem . to this end",
    ", a multigrid smoother is used to approximate this auxiliary problem , which is independent of the primary equation and is performed in parallel with the primary problem .",
    "the cost is the same order of complexity with computing the residual - based estimator , which is much less than solving the original @xmath0 problem .",
    "an alternate route is illustrated as well in section [ sec : loc ] by approximating a localized auxiliary problem . while embracing the locality , the parallel nature using the multigrid smoother",
    "the recovery through approximating localized problem requires the user to provide element residual and tangential face jump of the numerical magnetizing field based on the finite element solution of the primary equation .",
    "the estimator is then defined as the sum of the modified element residual and the residual of the auxiliary constitutive equation .",
    "it is proved that the estimator is equal to the true error in the energy norm globally . moreover , in contrast to the mechanism of the proof using helmholtz decomposition mentioned previously , the decomposition is avoided by using the joint energy norm . as a result , the new estimator s reliability does not rely on the coefficients distribution ( theorem [ th : rel ] ) .",
    "meanwhile , in this paper , the method and analysis extend the functional - type error estimator in @xcite to a more pragmatic context by including the mixed boundary conditions , and furthermore , the auxiliary variable @xmath29 is approximated by a fast multigrid smoother , or by solving a localized @xmath0 problem on vertex patches , to avoid solving a global finite element approximation problem .",
    "lastly , in order to compare the new estimator introduced in this paper with existing estimators , we present numerical results for @xmath0 intersecting interface problems .",
