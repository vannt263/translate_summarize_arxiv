    "the variables in are nondimensional and unscaled ; @xmath3 and @xmath4 are proportional to position along the channel and time , respectively , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are proportional to the elevation of the free surface above a level of rest corresponding to @xmath7 , and to the horizontal velocity of the fluid at the free surface , respectively .",

    "( for a precise statement of this result see section 6.2 below . )",
    "we shall also consider the analogous ibvp for a _ symmetric _ variant of the shallow water equations , posed again on @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "for this purpose we seek @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , satisfying @xmath22 here , the nonlinear hyperbolic system is symmetric ; existence - uniqueness of @xmath16-solutions of the ibvp for @xmath23 sufficiently small may be established if one follows the argument of @xcite , cf .",
    "section 6.2 below .",
    "we chose this symmetric system motivated by the work of bona , colin , and lannes , @xcite , on completely symmetric boussinesq - type dispersive approximations of small - amplitude , long - wave solutions of the euler equations . in section 6.3",
    "we derive the symmetric system in the context of small - amplitude , scaled shallow water equations and study its relation to the usual shallow water system by analytical and numerical means .    in the analysis of the galerkin approximations that we pursue in this paper we generally prove in parallel error estimates for both and .",
    "it will be seen that , as a result of the symmetry of the latter system , the proofs for are more straightforward and generally hold under less stringent hypotheses compared to their analogs .",
    "let us also mention that it is easy to see that the solution of satisfies the @xmath0-conservation equation @xmath24 for @xmath14 .",
    "we begin the error analysis in section 2 considering first the standard galerkin semidiscretizations of and using for the spatial approximation piecewise polynomial functions of order @xmath25 ( i.e. of degree @xmath26 ) with respect to a quasiuniform mesh on @xmath12 $ ] of maximum meshlength @xmath27 ; the spaces consist of @xmath28 functions , where @xmath29 .",
    "we assume throughout that the solutions of and are sufficiently smooth for the purposes of the error estimates . in the case of the error analysis is straightforward due to the symmetry of the system and yields , for @xmath25 , the expected @xmath30 @xmath0-error estimate for the galerkin approximations of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "( in this proof and in subsequent error estimates in this paper we compare the galerkin approximation with the @xmath0 projection of the solution of the p.d.e .",
    "problem onto the finite element subspaces and estimate their difference . ) for the proof is more complicated ; we use a symmetrizing choice of test function in the error equation corresponding to the second p.d.e . of , a ` superapproximation ' property of the finite element subspaces , and the positivity of @xmath33 in order to establish the expected @xmath30 @xmath0-error estimates for @xmath31 and @xmath32 assuming now that @xmath34 .",
    "this last assumption is needed in the proof for the control of the @xmath35 norm of an intermediate error term .",
    "thus our proof for and its assumptions resemble those of the analogous proof of dupont , @xcite , in the case of a @xmath36 nonlinear hyperbolic system which is close relative of .",
    "it is worth noting that numerical experiments , the results of which are presented at the end of section 2 , suggest that for @xmath37 , i.e. for piecewise linear continuous functions on a quasiuniform mesh , the @xmath0- and @xmath38- errors of the galerkin approximations to @xmath31 and @xmath32 have @xmath39 bounds , i.e. that the assumption @xmath34 may not be needed .",
    "in fact , for special quasiuniform meshes , e.g. for piecewise uniform or gradually varying meshes , the numerical experiments indicate that the error bounds are of @xmath1 , resembling those of the uniform mesh case ( see below . )    in sections 3 and 4 we examine the error of the standard galerkin semidiscretization of and in the special case of subspaces of continuous , piecewise linear functions on a uniform mesh on @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "it is well known that for _ linear _ , first - order hyperbolic equations in the uniform mesh case the standard galerkin approximations may enjoy optimal - order @xmath0-convergence , i.e. of @xmath40 , as a result of superaccuracy due to cancellations in the interior mesh intervals and to suitable compatibility conditions at the boundary , provided the solutions of the continuous problem are smooth enough .",
    "early evidence of this were the classic results of dupont , @xcite , in the case of @xmath37 , and @xmath41 ( with @xmath42 , i.e. cubic splines ) , and e.g. of thome and wendroff , @xcite , for problems with variable coefficients in the case of subspaces consisting of smooth splines of arbitrary order ( @xmath43 , @xmath25 ) . in these works the _",
    "periodic _ initial - value problem was under consideration ; the spatial periodicity and the assumed smoothness of solutions automatically furnishes the requisite compatibility conditions at the boundary that yield superaccuracy . in section 6.1 of @xcite",
    "we point out how compatibility at the boundary for smooth solutions of a simple initial - boundary - value problem for a first - order linear hyperbolic equation gives the superaccuracy estimate in the case @xmath37 for uniform mesh .",
    "we also refer the reader to the papers @xcite and @xcite for results and references to the chinese literature on related topics .    in order to treat the nonlinear case , in section 3 of the paper at hand",
    "we prove some superconvergence properties of the @xmath0 projections of smooth functions on @xmath12 $ ] satisfying suitable boundary conditions , onto spaces of piecewise linear , continuous functions defined on a uniform mesh in @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "the key results are lemmas 3.3 and 3.6 in which it is shown that integrals of the form @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a @xmath46 function and @xmath47 is the error of the @xmath0 projection of a @xmath48 function satisfying suitable boundary conditions at @xmath49 and @xmath50 , is , for any mesh interval @xmath51 , of @xmath52 .",
    "these results are used in section 4 where the optimal - order @xmath1 @xmath0-error estimates for the galerkin semidiscretizations of and are established .",
    "it is assumed that the ibvp s have classical , sufficiently smooth solutions , which , as a consequence of their smoothness , must satisfy natural compatibility conditions at @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "again the proof for the is relatively straightforward , while in the case of some additional twists are needed .",
    "these theoretical results are confirmed in numerical experiments at the end of section 4 .",
    "these also indicate that the analogous @xmath0 errors for spatial discretizations with cubic splines ( @xmath42 , @xmath41 ) on uniform meshes have convergence rates which are practically equal to 4 , i.e. optimal .",
    "in section 5 we turn to the temporal discretizations of the o.d.e .",
    "systems represented by the semidiscretizations considered in sections 2 and 4 . in @xcite dupont analyzed , in the case of a system similar to the shallow water equations , the convergence of a linearized crank - nicolson scheme . in the paper at hand we analyze three explicit runge - kutta schemes : ( i ) the explicit euler method , of first - order accuracy , which requires for stability the restrictive mesh condition @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the ( uniform ) time step .",
    "( ii ) the ` improved ' euler method ( explicit midpoint rule ) of second - order accuracy , which requires for stability the mesh condition @xmath55 .",
    "( iii ) an explicit , third - order runge - kutta method due to shu and osher , @xcite , that needs the condition @xmath56 for a small enough constant @xmath57 .",
    "( it is to be noted that these stability restrictions are consistent with those predicted by the stability analysis of the temporal discretization with these methods of the stiff linear systems of o.d.e.s resulting e.g. from the standard galerkin semidiscretization of @xmath58 with periodic boundary conditions . )",
    "since our emphasis is on the energy proofs of stability and convergence of the time - discrete schemes , we chose the easiest p.d.e . system , i.e. , and the most straightforward spatial discretization , i.e. the one with piecewise polynomial functions of order @xmath59 on a quasiuniform mesh , in order to prove the @xmath0-error estimates ; these have bounds of @xmath60 for @xmath25 , @xmath61 for @xmath34 , and @xmath62 for @xmath34 , for the three runge - kutta schemes considered , having orders of accuracy 1,2 and 3 , respectively ; these error estimates hold under the mesh stability conditions previously mentioned .",
    "similar results hold for the system but the proofs are omitted here .",
    "numerical experiments in section 5 with and indicate that the condition @xmath55 is probably necessary for the stability the improved euler method even in the simple case of a spatial discretization using piecewise linear , continuous functions on a uniform mesh .",
    "the results of another numerical experiment suggest that in addition to the @xmath0-error , the @xmath38- and @xmath63-errors of full discretizations of with the shu - osher scheme have an @xmath64 temporal behaviour .",
    "we should point out that in recent years there have appeared a number of papers with proofs of error estimates of full discretizations of galerkin type methods with explicit runge - kutta methods .",
    "for example , zhang and shu have analyzed discontinuous galerkin methods for scalar conservation laws in @xcite and for symmetrizable systems of conservation laws in @xcite using a second - order explicit runge - kutta method ( the explicit trapezoidal rule ) for time - stepping .",
    "for the dg methods analyzed in these papers this full discretization turns out to be stable if @xmath65 for a @xmath66 spatial discretization but needs @xmath54 to be of @xmath67 for higher - order polynomial spaces .",
    "the same runge - kutta scheme is used by ying , @xcite , and proved to yield a stable full discretization and the expected error estimates for a standard galerkin method for scalar conservation laws in several space dimensions under the condition @xmath55 . in @xcite zhang and shu",
    "prove error estimates for a fully discrete dg-@xmath68 order shu - osher scheme for scalar conservation laws under the condition @xmath65 . in @xcite burman",
    "_ et al . _",
    "consider initial - boundary value problems for first - order linear hyperbolic systems of friedrichs type in several space dimensions , discretized in space by a class of symmetrically stabilized finite element methods that includes dg schemes , and in time by explicit runge - kutta schemes of second ( rk2 ) and third ( rk3 ) order of accuracy .",
    "they prove @xmath0-error estimates of optimal order in time and quasioptimal in space under courant - number restrictions for rk2 schemes with @xmath66 elements and under the condition @xmath55 for higher - order elements , and under courant - number restrictions for rk3 schemes .",
    "let us also mention that for a closely related to the shallow water equations _ dispersive _ system ( the ` classical ' boussinesq equations ) , we proved error estimates in @xcite , @xcite , for the classical , four - stage , fourth - order explicit runge - kutta temporal discretization of standard galerkin methods with cubic splines ; the error bounds had an @xmath69 dependence under a @xmath65 stability condition .",
    "we close the paper by a series of supplementary remarks in section 6 . in section 6.1",
    "we consider the _ periodic _ initial - value problem for the shallow water system and its symmetric version and discretize it in space using the standard galerkin method with smooth periodic splines of order @xmath25 on a uniform mesh .",
    "using suitable _ quasiinterpolants _ in the space of periodic splines , cf .",
    "@xcite , we prove optimal - order , i.e. @xmath40 , @xmath0-error estimates for both systems . in section 6.2",
    "we state precisely the local existence result proved by petcu and temam in @xcite for ; we also state the analogous result that one may derive for following the proof of @xcite .",
    "finally , in section 6.3 we first recall the nondimensional _ scaled _ form of the shallow water equations in the case of long surface waves of _ small _ amplitude ( in which the nonlinear terms of the system are multiplied by the small parameter @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is a typical wave amplitude and @xmath72 the depth of the channel ) , and derive the analogous scaled form of the symmetric shallow water equations using the nonlinear change of variables of bona , colin , and lannes , @xcite . in view of the classical theory of local existence of solutions of initial - value problems of quasilinear hyperbolic systems and the results of @xcite",
    "we argue that the difference in suitable norms of appropriately transformed solutions of the two systems is of @xmath73 for times @xmath11 up to @xmath74 .",
    "given that initially smooth solutions of both systems are expected in general to develop singularities after times of @xmath74 , this result indicates that appropriately transformed , smooth , small - amplitude solutions of the symmetric system remain close to corresponding smooth solutions of the usual system within their life span , and provides a justification for the symmetric system .",
    "section 6.3 closes with some numerical experiments which suggest that the difference of solutions of and ( i.e. of the ibvp s ) also behaves like @xmath75 for times up to @xmath74 .    in this paper",

    "<S> we consider a simple initial - boundary - value problem for the shallow water equations in one space dimension , and also the analogous problem for a symmetric variant of the system . assuming smoothness of solutions , we discretize these problems in space using standard galerkin - finite element methods and prove @xmath0-error estimates for the semidiscrete problems for quasiuniform and uniform meshes . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we show that in the case of spatial discretizations with piecewise linear continuous functions on a uniform mesh , suitable compatibility conditions at the boundary and superaccuracy properties of the @xmath0 projection on the finite element subspaces lead to an optimal - order @xmath1 @xmath0-error estimate . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine temporal discretizations of the semidiscrete problems by three explicit runge - kutta methods ( the euler , improved euler , and the shu - osher scheme ) and prove @xmath0-error estimates , which are of optimal order in the temporal variable , under appropriate stability conditions . in a final section of remarks </S>",
    "<S> we prove optimal - order @xmath0-error estimates for smooth spline spatial discretizations of the periodic initial - value problem for the systems . </S>",
    "<S> we also prove that small - amplitude , appropriately transformed solutions of the symmetric system are close to the corresponding solutions of the usual system while they are both smooth , thus providing a justification of the symmetric system . </S>"
