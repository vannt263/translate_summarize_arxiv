    "the theoretical and experimental investigation of nonlinear quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) effects arising due to vacuum polarization in the presence of a strong external field renders possible testing qed when the nonperturbative effects in the field strength ( contributions of higher - order terms ) are very significant .",
    "one of these effects , the scattering of a photon in the electric field of atoms ( delbrck scattering ) , has been investigated in detail both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "also , a decisive progress has been obtained in the understanding of the process of photon splitting in an atomic electric field @xcite . in @xcite the first successful experimental observation of photon splitting in an atomic field is reported . as a result",
    ", it has been observed that higher orders of the perturbation theory with respect to the parameter @xmath1 play an important role and essentially modify the cross sections of delbrck scattering and photon splitting in an atomic field at high photon energy ( here , @xmath2 is the nuclear charge number , @xmath3 is the fine - structure constant , with @xmath4 being the electron charge and the system of units @xmath5 is used ) .    besides the atomic field",
    ", photon splitting has also been investigated in other configurations of the external field , namely in constant electromagnetic fields @xcite and in a laser field @xcite . in @xcite photon",
    "splitting in a laser field with arbitrary strength and frequency content has been investigated for an arbitrary energy of the incoming photon .",
    "the photon splitting amplitude in a laser field depends on two parameters that , in the frame where the laser wave propagates in the direction anti - parallel to the momentum @xmath6 of the initial photon , are given by @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is the energy of the incoming photon , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the characteristic frequency and electric field strength of the laser wave , @xmath11v / cm is the so - called critical electric field and @xmath12 is the electron mass . at present",
    ", the parameters of optical laser fields as well as of photon sources permit achieving nowadays values of @xmath13 where non - perturbative effects in the laser field become important @xcite .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the structure of the photon splitting cross section in the case of both constant and laser fields does not allow one measuring this effect without considerable effort .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider a process which is closely related to photon splitting in a laser field .",
    "namely , we study photon scattering ( delbrck scattering ) in combined coulomb and laser fields .",
    "we perform our calculation in the born approximation with respect to the coulomb field and exactly in the parameters of the laser field .",
    "thus , the amplitude obtained is linear in @xmath1 and corresponds to photon splitting in a laser field when an initial real photon with the momentum @xmath14 , @xmath15 , splits into a real photon with the momentum @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and a virtual photon ( coulomb quantum ) with the momentum @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",

    "the amplitudes are derived following the method described in detail in our paper @xcite and based on the operator technique developed in @xcite for the calculation of the polarization and mass operators in a laser field .",
    "the advantage of the operator technique is that it enables one to calculate the amplitudes of the processes without employing the explicit form of the electron propagator in the external field .",
    "we first derive the explicit expressions of the amplitudes for a general vector potential of the form @xmath26 ( section ii ) .",
    "then , we consider the case of a monochromatic laser field with circular polarization ( section iii ) and analyze in detail the properties of the amplitudes for the most interesting parameter region : @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( section iv ) .",
    "finally , in section v , the results are discussed and the main conclusions of the paper are presented .",
