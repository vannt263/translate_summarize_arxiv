    "hi line widths , @xmath5 , are observed to vary from @xmath6 to @xmath7 km s@xmath3 in the central parts to @xmath8-@xmath9 km s@xmath3 in the outer parts . beyond the optical disk , the maps of @xmath5 display a patchy distribution with values populating the interval from @xmath10 to @xmath11 km s@xmath3 , independent of galactocentric distance .",
    "the median value is fairly constant along the extended outer parts , with about the same universal value @xmath12 km s@xmath3 for all the observed galaxies ( @xcite , and references therein ) . by fitting two - component gaussians to the hi profiles in ngc 6822 , the second - moments for the cold and warm phases of the hi were found to be @xmath13 km s@xmath3 and @xmath14 km s@xmath3 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the observed @xmath5 are likely to represent turbulent small - scale motions : the existence of a cold phase in the outer disks , the observed level of star formation and the double exponential radial profile of the star formation rate have been also interpreted as a consequence of the turbulence gas compressions in the outer disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found that if turbulence is driven by supernova , the velocity dispersion of the hi gas in the quiescent regime is @xmath15 km s@xmath3 , a factor of @xmath16 smaller than the observed values .",
    "thus , either there are other physical processes driving turbulence or the supernova feedback efficiency has been underestimated . there exist several physical mechanisms that could drive turbulence even in the absence of star formation : hydrodynamic or magnetohydrodynamic instabilities , frequent minor mergers of small satellite clumps , ram pressure or infalling gas clouds . amongst the hydrodynamical instabilities , the thermal instability by itself can not sustain turbulence @xcite .",
    "the magnetorotational instability , on the other hand , can only account for an amount of turbulent motions @xmath17 km s@xmath3 for the three components , if thermal broadening is not subtracted , and might be completely suppressed by stellar feedback ( dib et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) .",
    "our main goal is to assess how much of the velocity dispersion observed in the ism can be due to the impact of high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) and intermediate velocity clouds ( ivcs ) .",
    "ample evidence for the presence of continuing gaseous infall to the galactic disk has been compiled in @xcite .",
    "all the studies firmly suggest that the inflow in the galactic disk has been constant , with an accretion rate of @xmath18 m@xmath19 yr@xmath3 , or has even increased , during its lifetime .",
    "hi observations have revealed accretion of both diffuse and discrete structures from the extended environment in m31 and m33 @xcite .",
    "@xcite infers that the present total mass in condensed infalling clouds around the milky way is @xmath20",
    "m@xmath19 if they are all at distances @xmath21 kpc . hvcs may be a repository for large amounts of gas if clouds fall into the disk rapidly after they are formed @xcite . in the next sections , we consider the turbulent hi dynamics driven by the infall of clouds .",
    "preliminary results were reported in snchez - salcedo et al .",
    "the ideal mhd equations are integrated using the zeus code ( stone & norman 1992a , b ) . a local cartesian frame of reference with @xmath22 and @xmath23 corresponding to the horizontal and vertical directions , respectively ,",
    "was adopted to simulate a small patch of our galaxy at a distance @xmath24 from the galactic center .",
    "the galactic symmetry plane , @xmath25 , is placed in the middle of the computational domain .",
    "the simulation domain is a square of size @xmath26 with @xmath27 zones .",
    "the ambient medium that is interacting with the hvcs is initially in plane - parallel magnetohydrostatic equilibrium with scaleheight @xmath28 in an external gravitational potential . here",
    "the scaleheight is defined as half width at half maximum of the vertical volume density of the gas layer .",
    "the ambient gas is initially isothermal in space with _",
    "thermal _ sound speed @xmath29 and its evolution is nearly isothermal with specific heat ratio @xmath30 .",
    "gas self - gravity was disregarded .",
    "the magnetic field has only one component along the @xmath31axis and is initially stratified in the @xmath23direction , @xmath32(@xmath23 ) .",
    "thus , there is no magnetic tension , only magnetic compression .",
    "two magnetic configurations are explored .",
    "the first one is the high - latitude extension of the galactic thick disk of boulares & cox ( 1990 , bc model hereafter ) following @xcite .",
    "the vertical gravitational force and the magnetic field configuration were scaled to the outer galaxy , neglecting edge effects .",
    "the second set of models assumes that @xmath33 falls off with the gas density ( spitzer case ) in the initial equilibrium configuration , so that @xmath34 , defined as the ratio between the magnetic and thermal pressure , is constant . in all the simulations , the size of the domain is @xmath35 in order to avoid spurious boundary effects .",
    "we apply periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath22axis , and open boundary conditions on the upper and lower faces of the computational domain .",
    "the too low thermal gas pressure at the outer parts of extended galactic disks will permit only the warm ( several times @xmath36 k ) phase of hi to exist ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite provides observational evidence that about half of the mass of the diffuse gas in the galaxy may have temperatures from a few hundred to a few thousand kelvin . in this work",
    ", we will explore @xmath29 values in the range @xmath37@xmath9 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the ambient gas is subject to a continuous rain of hvcs . in most simulations ,",
    "if not specified otherwise , all the clouds with initial radius @xmath38 and uniform internal density @xmath39 , are injected at @xmath40 with a vertical velocity @xmath41 , and are placed randomly in @xmath22 .",
    "we found that the statistical properties of the flow in the disk are similar when the injection occurs along both caps @xmath42 .",
    "the remaining five dimensionless parameters that characterize our simulation models are @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the midplane volume density at @xmath49 and @xmath47 is the fraction of accreted mass in one sound crossing time , @xmath50 with @xmath51 is the initial column density of the disk .",
    "note that once @xmath29 is fixed , the scaleheight @xmath28 is determined by the depth of the external gravitational potential .",
    "the collisions of infalling clouds onto the gaseous disk will take the gas out of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "consequently , the scaleheight @xmath52 of the hi layer may evolve in time .",
    "the disk gas is subject to a stocastic driving force caused by the mhd pull of randomly - injected clouds , plus the restoring gravitational force which tends to push back the gas to the midplane .",
    "the level of substructure in the resulting fluid depends on the structural parameters of the clouds and injection velocity .",
    "we focus first on describing the evolution of our fiducial bc model , labelled as run bca , that is intended to represent conditions at a galactocentric distance @xmath53 kpc . in this model , the parameters of the disk are @xmath54 km s@xmath3 , @xmath55 m@xmath19 pc@xmath56 and @xmath57 pc . for the clouds we adopted @xmath58 km s@xmath3 , @xmath59 kpc , @xmath60 @xmath61 and @xmath62 pc ( see snchez - salcedo et al .",
    "2007 for a discussion of this choice ) .",
    "the injection rate of clouds in the whole box domain is @xmath63 per gyr , corresponding to an accretion rate defined as @xmath64 of @xmath65 m@xmath19 yr@xmath3 . while our simulations are 2d , this situation is energetically equivalent to an accretion rate of @xmath66 clouds per gyr and per kpc@xmath67 of galactic disk . since the kinetic energy of a cloud is @xmath68 erg , the energy input rate from impacting clouds is @xmath69 erg gyr@xmath3 kpc@xmath56 , which is equivalent to @xmath70 supernova explosions per gyr and kpc@xmath67 of disk , each with mechanical energy @xmath71 erg , where @xmath72 is the efficiency factor . at the end of the simulation ( @xmath73 gyr ) ,",
    "the total mass in our grid increased by a factor @xmath74 .",
    "clouds interact with the ambient medium and dilute ( see fig.[fig : density - velocity ] ) . at a height of @xmath75",
    "pc they lose their identity and mix up with the turbulent disk .",
    "hence the number of ` active ' clouds is @xmath63 gyr@xmath76@xmath10 .",
    "the infalling clumpy flow perturbs the disk through mhd waves that interact in a complicated fashion , producing a network of plumes and shells ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : density - velocity ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the 1d rms velocity of the gas , @xmath77 , increases in time and saturates after @xmath78 myr , reaching values that oscillate between @xmath8 and @xmath79 km s@xmath3 around the mean value @xmath80 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rms - velocity ] ) .",
    "the difference between @xmath81 and @xmath82 is only @xmath83 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the velocity dispersion in each direction was obtained by fitting the mass - weighted velocity profile for cells within @xmath84 , with @xmath85 the asymptotic value of the scaleheight .",
    "examples of mass - weighted velocity profiles are given in figure [ fig : rms - velocity]b , c .",
    "remind that @xmath86 for isothermal gas , thus , @xmath87 km s@xmath3 . for @xmath88",
    "km s@xmath3 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 reach similar values as in the case @xmath58 km s@xmath3 .",
    "these results suggest that continuous accretion of a clumpy gas may contribute significantly to the random motions observed .",
    "the vertical density profile averaged on horizontal cuts is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : z - density ] , note that even though the injection of clouds occurs only through the upper cap @xmath40 , the density profile is quite symmetric and the net vertical displacement is relatively small .",
    "the scaleheight is @xmath91 pc at @xmath16 gyr , similar to the observed value at @xmath92 kpc .",
    "the injected energy is mostly dissipated in radiative shell compressions and behind shock fronts , being the dissipation timescale for turbulent kinetic energy @xmath93 myr .",
    "the energy spectrum contains information about how the kinetic energy is distributed at different scales and about the nature of the driving mechanisms of the random motions in the compressible ism . due to the stratification and the anisotropy of the random motions , we have calculated the power spectrum along horizontal cuts for each component of the velocity separately .",
    "the power spectrum follows a power - law with different exponent for each component @xmath94 , with @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite reported lognormal density probability distribution functions ( pdf ) for two- and three - dimensional isothermal turbulent flows .",
    "we have checked that , in fact , our pdf is approximately lognormal with excesses at large and low densities probably because in our case the turbulence is not isotropic and , in addition , there is some probability of finding density substructure that has not a turbulent origin , it being the remnants of infalling clumps .",
    "when the clouds are randomly injected along both caps , the mass enhancement in the central disk ( @xmath97 pc ) is slightly larger ( about @xmath98 ) than when the injection only proceeds along one side , because the symmetry in the injection leads to a more efficient balance of momentum .",
    "however , @xmath99 is quantitatively similar and thus there is no need to show it again .",
    "the elasticity of the disk to collisions depends on the speed of sound and on the magnetic field strength . in order to see the sensitivity of @xmath77 on the adopted magnetic configuration , we started with an @xmath100 spitzer model and the same @xmath29 and total pressure at the midplane as in run bca . @xmath81 and",
    "@xmath82 were found to be @xmath10 and @xmath101 km s@xmath3 , respectively .    it turns out very difficult to infer from basic principles how @xmath80 scales with @xmath29 or with any other parameter ( snchez - salcedo et al .  2007 ) . in order to gain some insight , spitzer configurations with @xmath100 but different @xmath29 , between @xmath10 and @xmath102 km s@xmath3 ( spaced by @xmath103 km s@xmath3 ) , were considered .",
    "if the total pressure at the midplane @xmath25 is identical in all the models and equal to the value in the standard model is the same in these models implies that the surface gas density increases for low values of @xmath29 . ] , we find that @xmath80 scales linearly with @xmath29 ; a good fit to the data is @xmath104 ( thermal broadening has been subtracted ) when @xmath88 km s@xmath3 .",
    "if , instead of the total pressure , the surface gas density is taken the same as in the case bca in all the experiments , then @xmath105 .",
    "for instance , using again @xmath88",
    "km s@xmath3 , @xmath82 varies from @xmath106 km s@xmath3 to @xmath107 km s@xmath3 when the sound speed drops by a factor of @xmath73 ( from @xmath102 km s@xmath3 to @xmath8 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "in order to simulate various galactic conditions at different galactocentric distances , runs have been carried out varying @xmath47 and @xmath44 .",
    "assuming that @xmath38 does not depend strongly on radius , @xmath44 should decrease with @xmath108 because the observed @xmath52 increases with @xmath108 , but it is uncertain as @xmath38 could also increase with @xmath108 as well .",
    "the radial variation of @xmath47 is also uncertain because the accreting mass flux @xmath109 and the temperature structure @xmath110 should be known . as a departure assumption",

    "if accretion occurs through rare mergers of very massive clouds , it would be hard to see how such a localized events could produce the observed uniform level of turbulence .",
    "nevertheless , experiments with input rates of new clouds @xmath114 times smaller than in our fiducial simulation ( i.e. , @xmath102 per gyr in our box domain ) but cloud radii @xmath10 times larger ( @xmath132 pc in physical units ) , so that the mass accretion rate is unchanged , still maintain a rather uniform level of turbulence everywhere .",
    "we have shown that rms velocities of @xmath133@xmath9 km s@xmath3 in the warm phase of hi naturally arise if outer disks are continuously stirred by a clumpy accretion flow at a rate consistent with observations .",
    "the exact radial variation of the hi line width depends on the uncertain contribution of the thermal broadening as a function of radius and on the adopted accreting mass flux @xmath109 , which ultimately depends on which the origin of the condensing clouds is .",

    "isothermal simulations do not capture all the physics of the multiphase ism to permit a detailed comparison between predictions and observations .",
    "three - dimensional simulations including cooling and heating in thermally bistable medium , plus a spectrum of mass and radius of the clouds are being undertaken .",
    "these experiments will allow us to derive the velocity dispersion for each component ( cool , warm and hot phases ) and compare them with high - resolution hi observations that have been able to identify cool and warm neutral components in the ism of external galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the accretion of clumpy gas can induce turbulence - compressed regions and trigger star formation , which should be also included .",
    "it is important to consider other phenomena arising in the present accretion scenario .",
    "for instance , if turbulence is driven by oblique accretion flows , a large asymmetry in the scaleheight of the hi disk as that observed between the northern and southern halves of the milky way @xcite is expected because oblique flows have an azimuthal dependence ( see @xcite ) .",
