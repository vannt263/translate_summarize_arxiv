    "measuring distances in our galaxy is critical to understanding its structure .",
    "however , line - of - sight distances can typically be measured with only relatively poor precision .",
    "this lack of precision is manifest in the most basic of galactic parameters ; the solar radius @xmath7 is hardly known to better than 5 percent uncertainty @xcite , and this result renders the circular velocity at @xmath7 similarly uncertain @xcite .",
    "an accurate knowledge of distances is essential to create convincing models of the milky way , which in turn influence our understanding of the physics of galaxy formation in general .",
    "conventional trigonometric parallax has long been used to calculate accurate distances to nearby stars .",
    "the regular nature of the parallactic motion of a star , caused by the earth s orbit around the sun , allows this motion to be decoupled from the intrinsic proper motion of the star in the heliocentric rest frame .",
    "hence the distance to the star can be calculated .",
    "however , the maximum baseline generating such parallaxes is obviously limited to 2au . for a given level of astrometric precision",
    ", this imposes a fundamental limit to the observable distance .",
    "indeed , the accuracy of parallaxes reported by the hipparcos mission data @xcite falls to @xmath8@xmath9 percent at best for distances @xmath10 and only then for the brightest stars .",
    "upcoming astrometric projects such as pan - starrs @xcite , lsst @xcite and the gaia mission @xcite will achieve similar uncertainty for sun - like stars as distant as a few kpc , and at fainter magnitudes than was possible with hipparcos .",
    "this extended range will encompass less than 1 percent of the total number of such stars in our galaxy .",
    "it is clear that it will _ not _ soon be possible to calculate distances to many of the stars in our galaxy with conventional trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "alternative means to compute distances to stars are therefore required .",
    "photometry can be used to estimate the absolute magnitude of a star which , when combined with its observed magnitude , allows its distance to be computed .",
    "unfortunately , all attempts to calculate such photometric distances are hindered by the same problems : obscuration by intervening matter alters both observed magnitude @xcite and colour @xcite , and it is difficult to model appropriate corrections without a reference distance scale .",
    "the effects of chemical composition and age further complicate matters @xcite .",
    "it is therefore difficult to compute photometric distances with an accuracy much better than 20 percent , even for nearby stars , and distances to faint stars are less accurate still @xcite .",
    "latterly , it was realised ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter 1 ) that the orbital motion of the sun about the galaxy could be used to compute trigonometric distances to stars . in the general case",
    ", it is not possible to do this because the parallactic motion of a star and its intrinsic proper motion are inextricably mixed up .",
    "however , in the special case where the star can be associated with a stellar stream , its rest - frame trajectory can be predicted from the locations of the other associated stars . using this trajectory , the proper motion in the galactic rest frame",
    "can indeed be decoupled from the reflex motion of the sun , and the component of its motion due to parallax can be computed .",
    "such ` galactic parallaxes ' have the same geometrical basis as conventional trigonometric parallaxes , and as such as free from errors induced by obscuration and reddening .",
    "however , the range of galactic parallax significantly exceeds that of conventional parallax .",
    "this is because the sun orbits about the galactic centre much faster than the earth orbits the sun , and because , unlike with conventional parallax , the galactic parallax effect is cumulative with continued observation . in realistic cases , for a typically oriented stream , we can expect the galactic parallax to be observable at nearly 40 times the distance of the equivalent trigonometric parallax , based on 3 years of observations . for increased range , one simply observes over a longer baseline .",
    "this large range means that galactic parallax might prove a powerful tool to complement conventional parallaxes , and validate other distance measuring tools .",
    "it is exciting to note that the capabilities of astrometric projects such as lsst , which will observe the conventional parallax of a g star at a distance of @xmath11 with 20 percent uncertainty , will put much of the galaxy in range of galactic parallax calculations with similar accuracy .",
    "the main restriction on the use of galactic parallax is the requirement for stars to be part of a stream .",
    "however , the continuing discovery of significant numbers of streams @xcite using optical surveys implies that they are a staple feature of the galactic environment , rather than a rarity .",
    "the deep surveys of pan - starrs and lsst are likely to find yet more , increasing the number of applications for galactic parallax .",
    "this paper explores the viability of using galactic parallax to estimate distances and demonstrates its practicality by applying it to data for the gd-1 stream @xcite published by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter k09 ) ; we choose to work with the latter over the earlier analysis of the same stream by @xcite on account of the significantly smaller proper motion uncertainties ( @xmath12 vs @xmath13 ) cited in the later work . throughout this paper , the solar motion",
    "is assumed to be @xmath14 , consistent with @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "section [ sec : galacticparallax ] reviews the calculation of galactic parallax , and explores the uncertainty affecting such calculations , and how this uncertainty affects practical application .",
    "section [ sec : tests ] demonstrates the viability of the method by applying it to pseudo - data , and section [ sec : gd1 ] applies the method to actual data for the gd-1 stream .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "suppose that a star is part of a stellar stream , and has a location relative to the sun described by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the distance to the star , and @xmath17 is the position of the sun . in the plane of the sky , let the tangent to the trajectory of the stream , near the star , be indicated by the vector @xmath18 .",
    "assume the velocity of the sun , @xmath19 , in the galactic rest frame ( grf ) is known .",
    "1 showed that if the measured proper motion of the star is @xmath20 , then @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the galactic parallax , @xmath23 is the proper motion as would be seen from the grf , and @xmath24 is the sun s velocity projected into the plane of the sky .",
    "we note that @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is that component of the star s grf velocity perpendicular to the line - of - sight , and that , @xmath27 eq . [ eq : fundamental ] is a vector expression and can be solved simultaneously for both @xmath23 and @xmath28 provided that @xmath18 , @xmath29 and @xmath24 are not parallel .",
    "the stream direction @xmath18 will not typically be known outright , but must be estimated from the positions of stream stars on the sky .",
    "we can achieve this by fitting a low order curve through the position data , the tangent of which is then taken to be @xmath18 . the curve must be chosen to reproduce the gross behaviour of the stream , but we must avoid fitting high - frequency noise , because @xmath18 is a function of the derivative of this curve , which is sensitive to such noise .",
    "we begin by rendering eq .",
    "[ eq : fundamental ] into an orthogonal on - sky coordinate system , whose components are denoted by @xmath30 . in this coordinate system",
    "[ eq : fundamental ] can be solved for @xmath28 , @xmath31 where the @xmath30 suffixes denote the corresponding components of their respective vectors , and where we have defined the angle @xmath32 .",
    "the choice of coordinates @xmath30 is arbitrary .",
    "we are therefore free to choose the coordinate system in which @xmath33 , i.e. that system in which the @xmath34-axis points along the stream trajectory , @xmath18 .",
    "[ eq : pi1 ] becomes , @xmath35 where we now identify the @xmath36-component of the various vectors as that component perpendicular ( @xmath37 ) to the stream trajectory , and the @xmath34-component as that component parallel ( @xmath38 ) to the trajectory .",
    "[ eq : pi2 ] shows explicitly that the galactic parallax effect is due to the reflex motion of stream stars perpendicular to the direction of their travel .",
    "uncertainties in the @xmath30 components of the measured quantities @xmath20 and @xmath24 , and uncertainty in @xmath39 , can be propagated to @xmath28 using eq .",
    "[ eq : pi1 ] .",
    "when we set @xmath33 , this equation becomes , @xmath40 where we anticipate the uncertainty in @xmath41 to be isotropic , and so we have set @xmath42 .",
    "we assume @xmath43 to be known from observations ; it may contain any combination of random and systematic error .",
    "@xmath44 is calculated directly from the error ellipsoid on @xmath19 , which is assumed known .",
    "any error on @xmath45 affects all data in exactly the same way .",
    "however , the projection of error on @xmath45 to @xmath24 varies with position on the sky .",
    "hence , the effect of @xmath46 is to produce a systematic error in reported distance that varies along the stream in a problem - specific way .",
    "uncertainty in @xmath39 arises from two sources .",
    "firstly , because the on - sky trajectory @xmath18 is chosen by fitting a smooth curve through observational fields , @xmath18 need not be exactly parallel to the underlying stream .",
    "further , since @xmath18 depends on the derivative of the fitted curve , it is likely to be much less well constrained for the data points at the ends of the stream than for those near the middle .",
    "we can quantify this effect . at the endpoints ,",
    "the fitted curve is likely to depart from the stream by at most @xmath47 , the angular width of the stream on the sky . for a low - order curve , this departure is likely to have been gradual over approximately half the angular stream length , @xmath48 , giving a contribution to @xmath49 from fitting of , @xmath50    the second contribution to @xmath49 arises as follows .",
    "since the stream has finite width , at any point , the stars within it have a spread of velocities , corresponding to the spread in action of the orbits that make up the stream .",
    "if the stars in a stream show a spread in velocity @xmath51 about a mean velocity @xmath52 , this effect contributes , @xmath53 to the uncertainty in @xmath39 for a single star .",
    "again we can choose @xmath33 , such that @xmath54 , the velocity dispersion perpendicular to the stream direction .",
    "[ eq : alpha : vspread ] becomes , @xmath55 where we have introduced @xmath56 , the grf speed of the stream , and @xmath57 , the angle of the stream to the line - of - sight .",
    "@xmath58 has its origin in the random motions of stars that existed within the progenitor object .",
    "in fact , if we assume the stream has not spread significantly in width , then the width and the velocity dispersion @xcite are approximately related by , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the physical width of the stream , and @xmath61 is the radius of the stream s perigalacticon .",
    "this gives , @xmath62 if secular spread has made the stream become wider over time , then this relation will over - estimate @xmath63 , since @xmath64 is roughly constant .",
    "@xmath47 therefore represents an upper bound on the true value of @xmath63 through this relation .",
    "this argument also assumes that the stream was created from its progenitor in a single tidal event .",
    "real streams do not form in this way . however",
    ", repeated tidal disruptions can be viewed as a superposition of ever younger streams , created from a progenitor of ever smaller @xmath58 .",
    "[ eq : alpha : equiv ] holds for each of these individually .",
    "thus , @xmath47 remains a good upper bound for @xmath63 through this relation .",
    "in reality , we do not measure the proper motion of individual stream stars , but rather the mean motion of a field of @xmath65 stars .",
    "the contribution to @xmath49 is from the error on this mean . putting this together with eq .",
    "[ eq : errora : curvefitting ] gives our final expression for @xmath49 , @xmath66 we note that the first term represents a random error , and the second term represents a systematic error that will vary with position down the stream . in general , @xmath67 and @xmath61 are a priori unknown .",
    "we can infer @xmath67 from radial velocity information , either directly where the measurements exist , or indirectly from galactic parallax distances .",
    "guessing @xmath61 requires assumptions to be made about the dynamics , but in general we expect the ratio @xmath68 or less .",
    "explicit evaluation of @xmath67 and @xmath61 are not necessary to evaluate the uncertainty if @xmath49 is dominated by the error from fitting , @xmath69 .",
    "we can see this will be the case when the number of observed stars per field , @xmath70 we expect this to be true in almost all practical cases .",
    "[ eq : fundamental ] can also be used to solve for @xmath23 , @xmath71 which becomes , @xmath72 when we set @xmath33 .",
    "[ eq : udot1 ] combined with eq .",
    "[ eq : pi1 ] can be used to explicitly propagate uncertainties in the measured quantities to @xmath23 .",
    "when @xmath33 , the uncertainty in @xmath23 is , @xmath73 @xmath74 and @xmath75 are calculated directly from the error ellipsoid on @xmath19 , which we have assumed known .",
    "[ eq : pi2 ] to eliminate @xmath76 from eq .",
    "[ eq : error : pi ] , and taking the dot product of @xmath18 with eq .",
    "[ eq : fundamental ] to simplify the last term , we obtain , @xmath77 where we have noted that @xmath78 , and we have related the observed stream length , @xmath48 , to the deprojected length , @xmath79 .",
    "we note that the last term is independent of @xmath16 , since @xmath80 and @xmath81 are both constant , and that for a stream of given physical dimension , the uncertainty in @xmath28 has no dependence upon the angle of the stream @xmath57 to the line of sight",
    ".    what level of uncertainty does eq .",
    "[ eq : error3 ] predict , when realistic measurement errors are introduced ?",
    "the answer to this is dependent upon the both the physical properties of the stream @xmath82 and the geometry of the problem in question @xmath83 .",

    "the average magnitude of @xmath24 taken over the whole sky is @xmath84 .",
    "the average perpendicular component , for a randomly oriented stream , is @xmath85 of this value .",

    "@xcite recently summarised the current state of knowledge of @xmath45 .",
    "the uncertainty quoted is typically @xmath89 percent on each of @xmath90 .",
    "correspondingly , we estimate a typical value for the uncertainty @xmath44 of 5 percent of @xmath86 , or @xmath91 .",
    "the gd-1 stream that we consider below is exceptionally thin and long , with @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",

    "the typical values mentioned , eq .",
    "[ eq : error3 ] reports an uncertainty of @xmath102 percent . by far",

    "[ eq : error3 ] , hence , the error on proper motion measurement is dominating our uncertainty .    to obtain an uncertainty of @xmath103 percent with @xcite proper motion measurements",

    "@xmath8 percent error is also possible at @xmath101 given optimum problem geometry .",
    "this is clearly competitive with the @xmath105 at which one could observe a standard trigonometric parallax , with similar accuracy , using astrometry of this quality .",

    ", the ability of pan - starrs to detect very faint stars will increase the number of stars identifiable with a stream , and thus reduce the uncertainty in the mean proper motion further than this , but we use @xmath111 as a conservative estimate .    the same @xmath101 distant stream would have a parallax error of @xmath112 percent with data this accurate .",
    "an error of less than @xmath8 percent is possible for a typical stream less than @xmath113 distant , and for a stream with favourable geometry less than @xmath114 distant .",
    "@xcite report that sdss photometric distances for dwarf stars have @xmath115 percent error at @xmath116 .",
    "thus , the accuracy of galactic parallax derived from pan - starrs data should be at least comparable to distance estimates from photometric methods , even in the typical case .",
    "future projects such as lsst and gaia will each obtain proper motions accurate to @xmath117 for sun - like stars @xmath101 distant @xcite .",
    "these data would allow a distance estimate for our typical stream accurate to @xmath118 percent , and a stream with favourable geometry accurate to @xmath119 percent .",
    "error in the proper motion no longer dominates the uncertainty in these calculations",
    ". we might expect such accurate astrometric surveys to reduce the uncertainty in the solar motion ; in this case , the error in parallax would be lower still .",
    "gaia will not observe sun - like stars beyond @xmath101 , but lsst will , with accuracy of @xmath120 for dwarf stars @xmath2 distant @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the parallax to our typical stream at this distance would be about @xmath121 percent with these data , and @xmath122 percent is achievable with optimum geometry .",
    "a typical stream could be measured to 20 percent accuracy out to @xmath123 , and a stream with favourable geometry out to @xmath124 ; this range approaches the limit of lsst s capability for detection of dwarf stars .",
    "such data will put the orphan stream , which is about @xmath125 distant @xcite , in range of accurate trigonometric distance estimation . for comparison , photometric distances from sdss data are hardly more accurate than 50 percent for this stream @xcite .",
    "to test the method , pseudo - data was prepared from an orbit fitted to data for the gd-1 stream by k09 .",
    "the orbit is described by the initial conditions @xmath126 , @xmath127 , where the @xmath34-axis points towards the galactic centre , and the @xmath36-axis points in the direction of galactic rotation .",

    "several points were sampled , and each was taken to be a separate datum in the pseudo - data set .",

    "the pseudo - data were transformed into the rotated coordinate system used by k09to facilitate comparison with their data ; the transformation rule is given in the appendix to k09 .",
    "the stream is very flat in this coordinate system , so the dependence of @xmath132 on @xmath133 is relatively weak .",
    "this helps to increase the quality of the fitted curve and minimises the corresponding error in @xmath69 .    to simulate the observed scatter in the real positional data ,",

    "the estimates of @xmath23 from the parallax calculation are consistent with these data , with the exception of the same datum at @xmath143 that also reports an anomalous distance .",
    "we explain this suspect datum as follows . from inspection of the top - right panel of fig . 13 from k09",
    ", it is apparent that the @xmath147 measurement for this datum is not in keeping with the trend .",

    "we also calculate a grf proper motion for the stream of @xmath157 , corresponding to a grf tangential velocity of @xmath158 in a direction @xmath159 .",
    "this implies that the stream is on a retrograde orbit , inclined to the galactic plane by @xmath160 , which is in accordance with previous results @xcite .",

    "this implies that the stream is at pericentre , although the large uncertainty prevents a firm conclusion from being drawn .",
    "we note that the radial velocity data in k09would also imply that the stream is observed at pericentre .",
    "we have demonstrated the practical application of a technique for computing galactic parallax , as described by 1 .",
    "this technique utilises the predictable trajectories of stars in a stream to identify the contribution of the reflex motion of the sun to the observed proper motion .",
    "the parallax and the galactic rest - frame proper motion follow from this .",
    "the only assumption made is knowledge of the galactic rest - frame velocity of the sun .",
    "it is also a requirement that the observed stars are part of a stream .",
    "recent evidence @xcite indicates that tidal streams are a common constituent of the galactic halo , and so this technique should have widespread application .",
    "we have derived an expression for the uncertainty in galactic parallax calculations .",
    "we include contributions from measurement errors in proper motion and solar motion , error in the estimation of stellar trajectories from the stream direction , and algorithmic error in the estimation of stream direction itself .",
    "the uncertainty for calculations involving a particular stream is depend upon the size , location and orientation of the stream , as well as upon measurement errors .",
    "we estimate that using individual proper motions accurate to @xmath13 , available now in published surveys @xcite , the parallax of a @xmath101 distant stream with typical geometry could be measured with an uncertainty of 40 percent .",
    "the parallax of a stream with optimum geometry could be measured with approximately half this uncertainty .",
    "proper motion data from the forthcoming pan - starrs ps-1 survey @xcite will yield the distance to a typical @xmath101 distant stream with 11 percent accuracy , or the distance to a stream at @xmath164 with 20 percent accuracy ; with favourable geometry this accuracy could be achieved for a stream as distant as @xmath114 . with data of this quality ,",
    "the uncertainty in distances from galactic parallaxes will be considerably lower than those of photometry for distant streams .",
    "the lsst @xcite and the gaia mission @xcite will produce proper - motion data that are more accurate still .",
    "such data would allow the distance to stars in a @xmath101 typical stream to be computed to an accuracy of order of 8 percent , where the limitation is now imposed by uncertainty in the solar motion and in the stream trajectory .",
    "it is likely that lsst and gaia data will allow the uncertainty in the solar motion to be significantly reduced , so in reality much better precision can be expected at this distance . for streams",
    "@xmath2 distant , lsst proper motions will allow distance estimates as accurate as 14 percent to be made in the typical case , and 6 percent with optimum geometry . thus , the high - quality astrometric data that is expected to be available in the next decade will allow parallax estimates for very distant streams to be made with unparalleled accuracy .    to test the method presented , we have created pseudodata simulating the gd-1 stream @xcite .",
    "when the method is provided with error - free pseudo - data , the correct parallax is computed perfectly . when errors are introduced into the pseudo - data , the reported parallax degrades in line with the uncertainty estimates .",
    "we applied the method to the astrometric data for the gd-1 stream in @xcite . with the exception of a single datum ,",
    "the galactic parallax is remarkably consistent with the photometric distances quoted by @xcite .",
    "indeed , the uncertainty in the measured proper motions quoted by @xcite should produce significant error in the galactic parallax .",
    "however , the scatter in the results is consistent a random error of only @xmath165 , and if the photometric distances of k09are believed , no systematic offset .",
    "this is at odds with the typical uncertainty in the proper motion of @xmath166 reported by @xcite .",
    "we can not explain this discrepancy , other than to suggest that the @xcite method for estimating error in the proper motions is producing significant over - estimates .",
    "the galactic rest - frame proper motions predicted for the stream are also consistent with observational data from @xcite , with the exception of the same datum that also reports an inconsistent distance .",
    "we conclude that the proper - motion associated with this datum is erroneous , and we predict that reanalysis of the stream stars near this datum will reveal a reduced proper - motion measurement of @xmath167 .",
    "photometry and galactic parallax produce fundamentally independent estimates of distance .",
    "the quality of the corroboration of the @xcite photometric distance estimates for gd-1 by the galactic parallax estimates presented here therefore lends weight to the conclusion that the predicted distance , in both cases , is correct . on this basis",
    ", we conclude that the gd-1 stream is about @xmath168 distant from the sun , on a retrograde orbit that is inclined @xmath6 to the galactic plane with a rest - frame velocity of @xmath169 .",
    "we also conclude that the visible portion of the stream is probably at pericentre .",
    "the prospect of being able to map trigonometric distances in the galaxy to high accuracy at tens of kiloparsecs range is indeed exciting .",
    "the distances generated using this method , although limited to stars in streams , could be used to calibrate other distance measuring tools , such as photometry , that would be more widely applicable .",
    "the technique is immediately applicable to any stream for which proper - motion data are currently available , although we anticipate limited accuracy until better proper - motion data are available .",
    "given enough parallax data points along a given stream , an orbit can be constructed by connecting those points .",
    "this orbit is predicted independently of any assumption about the galactic potential , which it must strongly constrain .",
    "constraints on the galactic potential impose constraints on theories of galaxy formation and cosmology .",
    "it would seem that the combination of dynamics and galaxy - scale precision astrometry , such as provided by this method , could well have profound implications for astrophysics in the future . at present , however , it is not obvious how to combine all sources of astrometric and dynamical information , to produce the tightest constraints on the potential .",
    "we therefore encourage the exploration of methods for combining this information , in anticipation of the arrival of higher quality astrometric data in the next few years .",
