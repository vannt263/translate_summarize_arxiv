    "large - scale structures are believed to have formed from the gravitational amplification of primordial perturbations . at its first stages",
    ", the process of gravitational clustering can be investigated using linear perturbation theory . however , as the universe evolves , nonlinear concentrations of mass arise .",
    "many structures we see today correspond to fluctuations several orders of magnitude higher than the mean density of the universe ; for example , clusters of galaxies have typically @xmath1 . for larger scales",
    "this ratio decreases , approaching unity in the largest structures .    as there is no analytical treatment for the nonlinear regime , @xmath0-body simulations",
    "are often resorted to .",
    "the numerical simulations had an enormous development in the last decade ( see bertschinger 1998 and references therein ) , being able to reproduce many features of the large scale structure .",
    "however they do not always provide a clear insight of the physics of nonlinear gravitational collapse .",
    "moreover , they are usually very time - consuming , making it difficult to scan a large part of the parameter space of the cosmological models .",
    "for this reason , semi - analytical methods have been devised to tackle such a complex problem .",
    "the first approximation developed to study the nonlinear regime was introduced by zeldovich ( 1970 ) .",
    "there are now various approximation schemes to analyze different aspects of non - linear clustering , including extensions of the zeldovich approximation ( for a review see sahni & coles 1995 ) . among them",
    ", the so - called local lagrangian approximations have been introduced rather recently .",
    "the basic feature of these local approximations is that the kinematical parameters in each fluid element evolve independently of those of other elements .",
    "thus the time evolution of a self gravitating fluid is replaced by a set of ordinary differential equations .",
    "this comes at the expense of losing information about the positions of each fluid element .",
    "only local quantities , such as the density contrast , shear and expansion rate can be determined .",
    "due to their handy applicability compared to the numerical simulations , as seen in the case of the widely used zeldovich approximation , they deserve a closer investigation .",
    "for some of these methods , certain aspects of their performance and applicability have already been discussed . however , to the authors knowledge , no systematic comparison among them has ever been done .",
    "we consider it worthwhile to analyze them in a unified way in order to exploit general properties of these approximations , clarifying their similarities and differences .",
    "it is also important to compare their performance in some practical applications . in this paper , we discuss the following four approximations , in addition to the zeldovich approximation : the local tidal approximation ( hui & bertschinger 1996 ) , the deformation tensor approximation ( audit & alimi 1996 ) , the complete zeldovich approximation ( betancort - rijo & lpez - corredoira 2000 ) and the modified zeldovich approximation ( reisenegger & miralda - escud 1995 ) .",
    "all of them intend to be applicable to the highly non - linear regime . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "these comprise all existent local approximations in the literature , that are exact for planar , spherical , and cylindrical symmetries ( except for the zeldovich approximation ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ aloc ] , we briefly review various local approximations in a unified way . in section [ applications ] , these methods are applied to several cases .",
    "first , we discuss the homogeneously collapsing ellipsoid .",
    "we then study their behavior under general initial conditions .",
    "finally , we apply some of these approximations to the calculation of the cosmological mass function .",
    "we sum up our results and present conclusions in section [ conclusion ] . in the appendices we present useful formulae for the calculation of the mass function together with fitting formulae for the collapse time in the approximations considered here .",
    "throughout this paper we will only consider the case of cold dark matter ( cdm ) , which is assumed to be collisionless , at least on large scales .",
    "this is well justified since 80 to 90% of the matter that clusters is composed by cdm ( turner 2000 , durrer & novosyadlyj 2000 ) .",
    "furthermore , as long as the trajectories do not intersect , we can treat the cdm as a pressureless fluid .",
    "we will be working in a matter - dominated flat universe ( the einstein - de sitter universe , hereafter eds ) .",
    "recent observational evidences are consistent with a zero curvature universe ( de bernardis et al .",
    "2000 ; hanany et al 2000 ) . even if we had a non - flat universe we would only require that the curvature be negligible in the scales of interest .",
    "the assumption of matter dominance may seem unrealistic since the observations indicate that the universe is now dominated by a repulsive homogeneous cosmological term ( perlmuter et al .",
    "1998 ; riess et al . 1998 ; zehavi & dekel 1999 ) .",
    "however , the energy density of this term decays more slowly than the matter density . in the case of a cosmological constant",
    "we would have @xmath2 .",
    "whereas for matter we have @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the scale factor of the universe .",
    "since most structures form at a time when @xmath5 , we can safely ignore the effect of the cosmological term on the collapse process .",
    "the peculiar motions in the universe are much smaller than the speed of light . for perturbations on scales smaller than the hubble radius",
    ", we can use the newtonian approximation to describe the gravitational clustering .",
    "the basic equations for nonrelativistic pressureless matter in a perturbed eds universe are the euler , the continuity and the poisson equations ( bertschinger 1996 ) : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the density contrast @xmath8 is the peculiar velocity , @xmath9 is the expansion , @xmath10 is the peculiar gravitational potential , and the time variable @xmath11 is related to the cosmic time @xmath12 ( also known as proper time ) by @xmath13 . the comoving coordinate @xmath14 is given in terms of the position @xmath15 by @xmath16 .",
    "the left hand side of equation ( [ euler ] ) is simply @xmath17 , so that it looks like the usual euler equation ( apart form the factor @xmath18 ) . in an einstein - de sitter background",
    "the scale factor is proportional to @xmath19 .",
    "we set @xmath20 such that @xmath21 .",
    "the present value of the scale factor @xmath22 is fixed to be unity .",
    "the lagrangian coordinates @xmath23 are often used instead of the position @xmath24 in nonlinear analyses . in terms of @xmath23 the convective derivative @xmath25 is simply given by the time derivative at fixed @xmath26 : @xmath27 .",
    "the lagrangian coordinates are chosen to be the initial comoving positions : @xmath28 .",
    "the jacobian matrix of the transformation @xmath29@xmath30 is known as the deformation tensor .",
    "the velocity gradient @xmath31 can be expressed in terms of @xmath32 as @xmath33 the density is given by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the determinant of @xmath32 .",
    "it is easy to see that the continuity equation ( [ continuity ] ) is solved exactly with @xmath36 .",
    "differentiating equation ( [ euler ] ) with respect to @xmath37 we find @xmath38 whose trace furnishes raychaudhuri s equation @xmath39 this is a local equation for @xmath32 in the sense that it has no spatial derivatives , although it is not sufficient for determining the nine components of the deformation tensor . usually this equation is written in terms of the kinematical parameters , @xmath40 @xmath41 ( shear ) and @xmath42 ( vorticity ) , defined by :    @xmath43    if the initial conditions have no vorticity , then we have @xmath44 during all the evolution , as long as the trajectories do not intersect . here",
    "we will consider only the case of vanishing vorticity .",
    "equations ( [ euler ] ) to ( [ poisson ] ) form a set of nonlinear partial differential equations .",
    "however , for certain specific configurations the time evolution of the deformation tensor @xmath32 behaves as if each space point evolves independently from the others .",
    "one might then expect that for more general situations the locality may hold , at least approximately , for these variables .",
    "accordingly , several methods have been introduced which are known as local approximations . in their framework",
    ", the influence of the neighbors may enter only through the initial conditions .",
    "in addition to the solution of the continuity and euler equations , the local approximations discussed here will replace the essentially nonlocal exact equation ( [ poisson ] ) either by some ansatz inspired on equation ( [ raychaudhuri ] ) , or by local evolution equations for the second derivative of the peculiar gravitational potential @xmath10 ( see also kofman & pogosian 1995 for a discussion ) .",
    "one of the basic features of local approximations is that the eigenvectors of the deformation tensor do not change with time .",
    "thus , once diagonalized , @xmath32 remains diagonal in the same frame , along all the evolution .",
    "this condition is either assumed from the beginning or appears as a consequence of the approximation introduced in the evolution equations . actually , this assumption is not strictly consistent with the evolution of the mapping @xmath45 , so that the reconstruction of space coordinates in these local approximations is not possible ( cf .",
    "subsection [ features ] ) .    in the basis where @xmath32 is diagonal , @xmath46 raychaudhuri s equation ( [ raychaudhuri ] ) is written as @xmath47",
    "the local approximations discussed here are required to be exact for planar , spherical and cylindrical symmetries .",
    "in the spherical case we have @xmath48 ; for a cylindrical perturbation @xmath49 , and @xmath50 whereas for planar symmetry @xmath51 . in these three cases ,",
    "as we have only one independent eigenvalue @xmath52 of the deformation tensor , this equation can be solved for @xmath52 .",
    "the _ zeldovich approximation _ ( zeldovich 1970 ) , hereafter za , can be viewed as a solution of the linearized form of equation ( [ em ] ) : @xmath53 zeldovich used the solution of the linearized equations ( [ euler ] to [ poisson ] ) @xmath54 and extrapolated it into the nonlinear regime .",
    "the eigenvalues of the deformation tensor are thus given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the eigenvalues of@xmath57 .",
    "substituting this expression into the eq .",
    "( [ lin ] ) we find two solutions for @xmath58 , known as the growing and decaying modes .",
    "for an eds universe we have @xmath59 since the decaying mode becomes negligible very quickly , only the growing mode is relevant for our discussion .",
    "the initial conditions are specified in terms of the @xmath56 , which are functions of the initial positions @xmath26 .",
    "the principal axes of @xmath60 are generally different for each point .",
    "we will denote the linear growing mode solution by @xmath61 : @xmath62 in the linear regime the density contrast @xmath63 will be given by @xmath64 .",
    "the gist of the zeldovich approximation is that the linearized trajectories can lead to nonlinear density perturbations .",
    "analogous ideas have been applied in many approximations .",
    "an example is the higher - order lagrangian expansions , where the perturbed quantity is the displacement field . in an eds universe",
    "the solution may be written in the form @xmath65 the first order solution @xmath66 is the zeldovich approximation .",
    "the determination of the higher order @xmath67 follows from the lower order ones through the solution of poisson equations .",
    "the second order solution is known as post - zeldovich approximation ( moutarde at al .",
    "1991 ; buchert 1992 ; lachize - rey 1993 ) , and the third order is called post - post - zeldovich ( juszkiewicz , bouchet , & colombi 1993 ; buchert 1994 ) .",
    "the zeldovich approximation is widely used for the weakly non - linear regime , and for generating initial conditions for numerical simulations .",
    "it gives the exact solution for the case of planar symmetry .      in the za the time factor in eq .",
    "( [ za ] ) is independent of the initial conditions , and it is valid only for the linearized limit in @xmath52 ( eq . [ lin ] ) .",
    "reisenegger & miralda - escud ( 1995 ) have proposed a generalization of the zeldovich approximation where @xmath58 may depend on the position through the initial conditions @xmath56 .",
    "the ansatz @xmath68 is substituted in equation ( [ em ] ) to give @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 e @xmath72 .",
    "this equation , which must be solved numerically , determines completely the function @xmath73 and defines the _ modified zeldovich approximation , _ hereafter mza .",
    "it is exact for spherical , planar and cylindrical symmetries .",
    "however , for underdense regions ( @xmath74 ) , the mza may not work , as pointed out by reisenegger & miralda - escud ( 1995 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that , when not all the three eigenvalues @xmath75 have the same sign , the denominator in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ mza ] ) will eventually vanish .",
    "thus mza can not be used with this kind of initial conditions .      in the two local approximations discussed above",
    ", the time dependence of the three @xmath76 is the same and it can be completely determined from equation ( [ em ] ) .",
    "the next two approximations will provide an equation for each of the three @xmath52 and an analytical solution of @xmath52 in terms of the linear solution @xmath77 ( eq . [ lambdai ] ) . due to the symmetry among the axes ,",
    "both the equation for @xmath52 and the explicit solution in terms of @xmath77 should be invariant under any exchange of indices , @xmath78 .",
    "equation ( [ em ] ) may be written in the form @xmath79=0 ,   \\label{poisson2}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is a permutation of @xmath81 .",
    "audit & alimi ( 1996 ) have , as an ansatz , split this equation into three equations for each @xmath52 :    @xmath82    this equation defines the _ deformation tensor approximation , _ hereafter dta .",
    "another motivation for the above equation is that it is exact for planar , spherical and cylindrical perturbations .",
    "we have thus a set of local equations that allows to determine each @xmath52 completely .",
    "of course this spliting of equation ( [ poisson2 ] ) is not unique and we could add more local terms in equation ( [ dta ] ) which would obey the symmetry requirement .      the _ complete zeldovich approximation , _ cza ( betancort - rijo & lpez - corredoira 2000 ) assumes that the @xmath52 can be expanded in terms of the linear solution @xmath77 ( eq . [ lambdai ] ) . to satisfy the symmetries required",
    ", the power series must have the following expression :    @xmath83    where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the coefficients of the @xmath86-th order terms , with @xmath87 .",
    "the zeldovich approximation corresponds to @xmath88 .",
    "the second order term @xmath89 coincides with that of the dta .    for planar configurations one should have @xmath90 thus @xmath91 .",
    "the other coefficients of the expansion are determined from equations ( [ euler ] ) and ( [ poisson ] ) through a recursive scheme .",
    "betancort - rijo & lpez - corredoira ( 2000 ) calculated explicitly the coefficients @xmath85 up to the terms of fourth order in @xmath92 in an eds universe .",
    "when the higher - order terms become important , all of them contribute roughly the same .",
    "thus betancort - rijo & lpez - corredoira have chosen to truncate the series at the fourth order and approximate the rest by a function @xmath93 .",
    "this function is parametrized in such a way that the result is in agreement with the exact planar , spherical and cylindrical dynamics .",
    "their expression for @xmath94 is : @xmath95 \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\left ( r_{\\mathrm{sp}}(\\lambda _ { i}+\\lambda _ { j}+\\lambda _ { k})-r_{% \\mathrm{sp}}(\\lambda _ { i})+r_{\\mathrm{sp}}\\left ( \\frac{\\lambda _ { j}+\\lambda _ { k}}{2}\\right ) \\right ) ,   \\label{r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 is the correction term @xmath94 , corresponding to the spherical symmetry . by comparing the numerical results for overdense perturbations with the truncated series solution ,",
    "they fitted @xmath97 as @xmath98    the expansion ( [ cza ] ) up to @xmath99 , together with expression ( [ r ] ) , gives nearly exact results for spherical and cylindrical overdense perturbations , and the exact result in the planar case .",
    "indeed , the cza predicts that a spherical perturbation with @xmath100 will collapse at @xmath101 , whereas the exact solution gives @xmath102 .",
    "the cza does not apply for perturbations with negative values of @xmath103 .",
    "for example ,",
    "when all the three @xmath56 are negative the volume element should expand indefinitely , hence the @xmath77 will approach infinity and therefore the series expansion breaks down .",
    "it can be easily seen that , as all @xmath85 are positive , if we truncate the series in an odd power of @xmath104 @xmath105 will change sign , and the fluid element will eventually collapse .",
    "the general relativistic equations for the kinematical parameters in the projection formalism are very akin to the newtonian ones ( see ellis 1973 ) .",
    "the analog of the poisson equation is obtained from the equation for the weyl tensor .",
    "barnes & rowlinson ( 1989 ) pointed out that by neglecting the magnetic part of weyl tensor @xmath106 , the evolution equation for the electric part @xmath107 becomes local .",
    "the dynamics of kinematical parameters is then reduced to a closed set of local equations .",
    "this result was first applied to structure formation by matarrese , pantano , & saez ( 1993 ) . since the magnetic part of the weyl tensor has no newtonian analogue , bertschinger & jain ( 1994 ) introduced the non - magnetic approximation , by simply discarding the magnetic part @xmath106 in the equation for @xmath107 in the application to the newtonian cosmology .",
    "this approximation is exact for spherical and planar configurations , but fails for cylindrical symmetry .",
    "also it was not able to reproduce the dynamics of the collapse even for a homogeneous ellipsoid .",
    "thus we will not consider this approximation further in this work .",
    "bertschinger & hamilton ( 1994 ) pointed out that , in a `` newtonian '' limit , the role of the magnetic part @xmath108 is not altogether negligible ( see also ellis & dunsby 1997 ) . within this framework , hui & bertschinger ( 1996 )",
    "have proposed the _ local tidal approximation _ ( lta ) , which consists in discarding some terms in the evolution equation for @xmath109 , to get    @xmath110    where @xmath109 is the newtonian limit of @xmath111 , which gives the tidal field : @xmath112 equations ( [ lta ] ) and ( [ divphi ] ) written in terms of @xmath109 form a closed set of local equations .",
    "it was shown that the lta is exact for spherical , planar and cylindrical symmetries .",
    "in general , it is exact whenever the orientation and axis ratios of the gravitational and velocity equipotentials are equal and constant for the mass element under consideration ( hui & bertschinger 1996 ) .",
    "it is possible to show that in the lta , once the velocity gradient is diagonalized , it will remain diagonal ( hui & bertschinger 1996 ) and so will the deformation tensor .",
    "we may write equation ( [ lta ] ) in terms of @xmath52 by using the equation ( [ eij ] ) together with equation ( [ divphi ] ) .",
    "we will then have a set of three third - order equations for @xmath52 which completely determines their evolution , once appropriate initial conditions are provided .",
    "alternatively , equation ( [ lta ] ) can be solved in terms of the kinematical parameters . in this case , the @xmath52 are calculated by ( eqs .",
    "( [ vgrad ] ) and ( [ gradv ] ) )    @xmath113    where @xmath114 are the eigenvalues of the shear @xmath41 .",
    "the local approximations discussed above are either a system of ordinary differential equations or explicit expressions in terms of the linear solution . in these approximations",
    "each point evolves independently of the others .",
    "the influence of the other fluid elements enters only through the initial conditions .",
    "they give the time evolution of the deformation tensor , and thus the kinematical parameters for each volume element .",
    "these local approximations are exact under some geometrical symmetries . in particular , they are exact whenever @xmath115 ; or @xmath49 , with @xmath116 or @xmath51 are satisfied locally .",
    "they are nonperturbative , i.e. , valid , in principle , for any @xmath63 or @xmath75 .",
    "the second order solution of the cza and dta ( eq . [ dta2 ] ) is in agreement with the result of second order lagrangian perturbation theory for the density contrast ( sahni & coles 1995 , betancort - rijo & lpez - corredoira 2000 ) .",
    "the za fails at second order .",
    "the local approximations are not appropriate for recovering the positions . to see this ,",
    "let us consider an initial configuration such that the deformation tensor is diagonal at every point @xmath117 if this holds initially , it will be valid throughout the evolution , according to the local approximations . in this case",
    "@xmath14 would be given by @xmath118 if @xmath52 had an explicit dependence on @xmath119 or @xmath120 nondiagonal terms would arise in equation ( [ diagonal ] ) ; hence @xmath52 must be a function of @xmath23 only .",
    "consequently , for this particular choice of initial conditions , each @xmath121 must depend only on the coordinate @xmath23 .",
    "however , as the @xmath122 evolve , they will in general depend on the three @xmath56 and , ultimately , on the three coordinates : @xmath123 . thus equation ( [ diagonal ] ) can no longer be satisfied .",
    "this shows that the local approximations in general violate the integrability of the deformation tensor . in other words",
    ", we can not recover the actual positions in the local approximations ( except when @xmath52 is independent of the initial position ) .    another way of seeing that the integrability is violated is as follows : if it were possible to reconstruct @xmath124 from @xmath125 , for example , then @xmath125 ought to be a gradient field in lagrangian space .",
    "therefore its curl should vanish . in the particular case of equation ( [ diagonal ] ) , this implies that @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "these conditions are satisfied , in general , only by the za for which @xmath128 ( provided that @xmath129 ) .",
    "thus , the only approximation which always permits the direct computation of the positions is the zeldovich approximation . in spite of the non - integrability ,",
    "these methods offer an approximate solution for the deformation tensor , allowing to calculate local quantities , such as the kinematical parameters .    if any eigenvalues of the deformation tensor approach @xmath130 , the density contrast @xmath131 will diverge .",
    "since they are functions only of @xmath4 and the initial conditions , @xmath103 , we can expand them near the collapse time @xmath132 , as @xmath133 therefore , the density contrast @xmath134 behaves , at the collapse time , as @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the dimensionality of the collapse ( @xmath137 for the collapse in only one axis , @xmath138 for the collapse in two axes simultaneously , and @xmath139 for the collapse in three axes ) .",
    "on the other hand , for the expansion @xmath140 , we have from equation ( [ continuity ] ) @xmath141 for @xmath142 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the other kinematical parameters can also be determined in a similar fashion .",
    "in order to compare the performance of these approximation schemes , we apply them to some specific situations in the following subsections .",
    "an initially homogeneous ellipsoid in an expanding universe develops in such a way that the homogeneity is almost preserved during all the evolution .",
    "therefore , the _ homogeneously collapsing ellipsoid _ model ( hce ) is considered to be very accurate ( eisenstein & loeb 1995 ; hui & bertschinger 1996 ) .",
    "the result of local approximations have been compared to this model .",
    "such a comparison is useful since it offers the possibility of checking these approximations in a less symmetrical situation ( hui & bertschinger 1996 ; audit & alimi 1996 ; betancort - rijo & lpez - corredoira 2000 ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to compare theses analyses including the mza .",
    "the equation of motion for the hce is given by ( icke 1973 ; white & silk 1979 ) @xmath143 where , as before , @xmath80 are permutations of @xmath144 , @xmath145 represent the axes of the ellipsoid in comoving coordinates , and @xmath146 are their asymptotic values for @xmath147 .",
    "the function @xmath148 is the degenerate case of carlson s integral of the third kind ( carlson 1977 ; press et al .",
    "1992 ) : @xmath149 the linear growing mode is @xmath150    as there is no rotation , the orientation of the principal axes does not change .",
    "thus , the position of each element will be proportional to the expansion in each direction .",
    "if an element inside the ellipsoid has initial position @xmath23 , then its coordinates at a later time will be given by @xmath151 with this expression we may compute the kinematical parameters which will not depend on the position .",
    "the same holds for the tidal field .",
    "hence we can compute the evolution of a fluid element according to the local approximations , and compare  with the evolution of @xmath109 , @xmath41 , @xmath63 and @xmath140 as derived from the ellipsoid solution with the same initial conditions .    from expression ( [ relips ] )",
    "we can see that the deformation tensor does not depend on @xmath23 inside the ellipsoid : @xmath152    as discussed in the previous section , the positions of the fluid elements may not necessarily be recoverable in the local approximations .",
    "however , the choice of the same @xmath52 for any fluid element ( @xmath52 independent of @xmath153 ) is consistent with the hce . in this case",
    ", we may recover the positions from the @xmath52 as @xmath154    in figure [ fig : ellipsplot ] we compare the time evolution of the axes @xmath155 of an ellipsoid in the five approximations discussed in this paper . here",
    ", the initial values @xmath156 of the axes were arbitrarily chosen to be @xmath157 with @xmath158 .",
    "the general conclusion does not depend substantially on the choice of these values , as will be seen in the next section .",
    "we see that the results of these approximations , except for the za , are very close to the one given by the homogeneous ellipsoid model .",
    "the za overestimates the collapse time , showing that a simple extrapolation of the linear trajectories underestimates the nonlinear effects .",
    "the common feature we observe in the local approximations is that the collapse occurs a little bit earlier in the directions of the two initially larger axes than the hce case , whereas the collapse in the direction of the shortest axis is slightly delayed compared to the hce . in other words , in the local approximations ,",
    "the tidal forces are reduced compared with the hce model .    concerning the collapse time @xmath159 ,",
    "all these approximations give very similar results as shown in table [ tab : colltime ] .",
    "the differences are less than @xmath160 .",
    "the mza gives the closest value to that of the hce .",
    "considering , however , that the hce itself neglects the effect of the interaction of the background with the ellipsoid , this will not necessarily indicate that the mza has the better performance among the other local approximations .",
    "in fact , for larger shear , the mza deviates from the others as will be seen in the next section .",

    "the parameter @xmath173 varies from @xmath174 to @xmath175 , @xmath176 from @xmath174 to @xmath177 , and @xmath172 can go from @xmath178 to @xmath179 .",

    "thus planar collapse is favored by these approximations .    for negative perturbations the difference among the approximations",

    "the lta  systematically gives slightly larger collapse times than the dta .",
    "the collapse time given by the za is the shortest among the three .",

    "the relevance of the shear in the nonlinear phase of gravitational clustering is in agreement with @xmath0-body simulations ( katz , quinn , & gelb 1993 ) , yet it is sometimes ignored in structure formation studies .",
    "any model based on the spherical collapse would miss this effect .",
    "an interesting aspect of the local approximations is that the collapse time has the same asymptotic behavior @xmath193 for high initial shear ( @xmath194 ) in all the approximations , where @xmath195 is a ( slowly varying ) function of @xmath176 only ( see appendix [ fits ] ) .",

    "the normalization factors for the local approximations are close to one ( @xmath228 for the dta , and @xmath229 for the lta ) whereas in the original ps derivation the normalization factor needed is @xmath230 .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in the spherical collapse model , only overdense regions collapse .",
    "the fact that around @xmath231 the number of objects is overestimated in the local approximations implies , due to the normalization of the mass function , that they should provide a lower estimate than the @xmath0-body simulations for large enough @xmath232 . there",
    ", the contribution from the low - mass objects is dominant ; in any realistic process , they may also arise from the fragmentation of larger clusters .",
    "the criterion for the formation of a clump from the direct collapse of an initially perturbed region does not account for these complex processes of fragmentation .",
    "therefore , the discrepancy of the mass function for high @xmath213 might be attributed to the use of expression ( [ ncollapsed ] ) rather than to the definition ( [ defn ] ) .",
    "we have investigated local lagrangian approximations to the nonlinear dynamics of pressureless dark matter .",
    "we have selected the modified zeldovich approximation ( mza ) , the deformation tensor approximation ( dta ) , the complete zeldovich approximation ( cza ) , and the local tidal approximation ( lta ) , in addition to the original zeldovich approximation ( za ) .",
    "these four approximations were designed to improve the za , and are in fact exact for planar , spherical and cylindrical symmetries , whereas the za is only exact for the planar case .",
    "they are semi - analytic and easy to be implemented in any application where local quantities are involved , such as the calculation of the mass function in the ps approach .",
    "all the local approximations discussed here , except for the za , provide quite a similar evolution for an ellipsoid , reproducing the results of the homogeneous ellipsoid model .",
    "thus , for this kind of positive density perturbations , these methods work fairly well . however , the mza turns out to deviate substantially for large values of the shear as was shown in section ( [ general ] ) , reflecting the fact that it does not give the correct second order solution .",
    "furthermore , the mza can not deal with initially underdense regions that will eventually collapse .",
    "therefore , its applicability is rather limited when compared to the other approximations .",
    "we note that the second order expansions of the cza , lta and dta coincide with the second order lagrangian perturbation theory , whereas those of the mza and za do not .",
    "it is interesting to recall that the lta and dta have very different origins from the cza , but still they give the correct second order result .",
    "the cza , lta and dta give quite analogous results for generic initial conditions .",
    "however , at least in its original form , the cza can not be used for negative values of @xmath77 .",
    "one possible solution to this problem might be achieved through an expansion such as @xmath233 the coefficients @xmath234 and @xmath58 should be appropriately chosen to adjust the asymptotic behavior ; in particular , we could use the numerical solution for underdense cylindrical and spherical perturbations to fit some of these coefficients , as done for the overdense case in the cza .",
    "besides , to agree with the perturbative solution ( [ cza ] ) we should have @xmath235 for higher orders , the determination of these coefficients is rather complicated .",
    "further investigations on this possibility should be pursued .",
    "concerning the mass function , it is found that the lta and dta give an accurate result for large masses as compared to the @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "the position of the peak is also in good agreement , whereas its amplitude is overestimated by a factor 2 compared to the @xmath0-body results .",
    "since the mass function is normalized to unity , this means that the local approximations , together with the ps formalism , underestimates the density of low - mass clusters .",
    "however , this might be a consequence of the criterion for the formation of a collapsed object based only on the collapse time .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the collapse time , as a function of @xmath190 and @xmath236 has an approximate scaling property ( see eq . [ separability ] ) , which is very precise for @xmath237 .",
    "we conclude that this may be a general feature of gravitational collapse in local approximations , whose validity is worth checking in a more general setting .",
    "while there is still not a clear theoretical understanding or support to the local approximations , they proved to be very accurate in the situations investigated here .",
    "they reproduce some well known features of nonspherical collapse , such as the possibility of collapse of some initially underdense regions , and the fact that the shear accelerates the collapse ( see sahni & coles 1995 ) .",
    "the main limitation of these approximations is that they only provide information about the internal state of a given mass element , but do not determine its position .",
    "even so , their simplicity is highly expedient for practical applications , such as the calculation of nonlinear corrections to the microwave background anisotropies , and the gunn - peterson effect . in particular , they are suitable for obtaining statistical properties of the present fields as a function of the primordial ones , as in the case of the mass function",
    ". further studies on the validity of these approximations , based on a comparison to @xmath0-body simulations , are required .",
    "such a comparison would allow to fully test the approximations described in this paper and more generically , the locality hypothesis .",
    "if they still provide accurate results in this case , the local approximations could represent good alternatives to the computer simulations , taking much less computational time , allowing thereby a larger scanning of initial conditions .",
    "they could give complementary information to the @xmath0-body simulations and would provide a better physical understanding of the nonlinear dynamics of self gravitating systems .",
    "most of the results of this paper may be extended to more general backgrounds .",

    "another interesting extension would be to include vorticity in the local approximations as was done for the za in ( buchert 1992 ; barrow & saich 1993 ) .",
