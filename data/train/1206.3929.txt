    "there is currently much interest in the mechanical properties of nanoscale objects such as rods and cantilevers @xcite .",

    "the effects of mechanical stress on nanostructures , such as the buckling of nanobeams , has been studied both experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "this latter work is directly related to the work in this paper .",
    "the system studied in the present paper is a nanobeam subject to compressive stress . according to standard continuum mechanics ,",
    "the beam will buckle as the magnitude of the associated compressive strain increases . more specifically ,",
    "following previous work @xcite , we consider a regime in which the dynamics of the buckled beam is usefully described by a 2-mode model obtained by truncation of the full dynamics . in the regime",
    "considered , one of the modes is always unstable , while the second mode can be either stable or unstable , and all remaining modes ( which are not considered explicitly ) are stable .",
    "we derive a 2 degree - of - freedom ( dof ) hamiltonian describing the 2-mode dynamics .",
    "the hamiltonian describes a bistable ( reactive ) mode coupled to a transverse degree of freedom ; the dynamical system thereby obtained has precisely the form of simple model potentials that have been used to describe isomerization reactions in chemistry @xcite .",
    "however , for the nanobeam problem , the simple form of the potential is a rigorous consequence of the 2-mode truncation of the dynamics rather than an approximation to an unknown molecular potential energy function .",
    "we can therefore investigate the dynamics of the buckled nanobeam using the conceptual framework established for the theory of isomerization reactions .",
    "a number of approaches to the study of isomerization dynamics have been developed in the chemical literature ( see , for example , refs ) .",
    "some basic relevant questions are the following : can ` isomerization ' of the nanobeam be characterized by a _ rate _ ?",
    "if so , can the rate coefficient be predicted using standard ( so - called statistical ) theories @xcite , such as transition state theory @xcite ? if not , what are the dynamical properties of the system that lead to non - statistical reaction dynamics ?",
    "chakraborty et al .",
    "have previously applied harmonic transition state theory ( tst ) to predict isomerization rates for various nanobeams under compressive stress @xcite .",
    "the rates obtained using basic harmonic tst are proportional to the inverse of the curvature of the potential transverse to the reaction coordinate , and so diverge at the strain value for which the second mode passes from being stable to unstable ( and the associated saddle point passes from being index 1 to index 2 @xcite ) .",
    "chakraborty has also applied a quantum version of harmonic tst to the nanobeam isomerization kinetics @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we examine the dynamics of a compressed buckled silicon ( si ) nanobeam from the perspective of reaction rate theory .",
    "the potential function which emerges from a standard modal analysis of the transverse beam displacements has a high degree of symmetry , and the appropriate dividing surface for computation of reactive flux is then in fact completely determined by symmetry .",
    "moreover , we are able to rigorously prove that the dividing surface is a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold in a specific energy range .",
    "the energy range is sufficient for treating the effects of the index one and index two saddles on the isomerisation dynamics in a unified fashion .",
    "we compute both the distribution of gap times and the reactive flux at a number of energies in a physically relevant range .",

    "for each case / energy we present two plots : one shows 20 trajectories initiated on the ds and followed until the first recrossing of the ds , while the other shows a single trajectory followed for 200 crossings of the ds .",
    "it is clear by inspection of the single trajectory plots that the dynamics is far from ergodic on the timescale considered ; the trajectories appear to be quasiperiodic or weakly chaotic at most .      both gap time distributions @xmath232 and associated ( unnormalized ) lifetime distributions @xmath233 have been computed for all cases .",

    "the smallest gap time is nonzero , reflecting a delay corresponding to the time it takes for a point on the shortest lived trajectory to reach the turning point and then return to the ds .",
    "the lifetime distribution of the set of trajectories in the pulse is however well described by a single exponential decay , with a decay rate ( denoted @xmath227 ) that is much faster than either the rrkm rate @xmath228 or the inverse of the mean gap time .    for cases ii and iii , the structure of the gap time distribution is more complex , consisting of multiple pulses .",
    "several early pulses have comparable amplitudes , with amplitude not necessarily decreasing monotonically with gap time . in such cases",
    "the computation of decay rates for individual pulses is less accurate due to the possibility of overlapping pulses . at long gap times",

    "the absence of a ` plateau ' region means that an isomerization rate constant _ does not exist _ for our nanobeam model in the physical regime studied .      to further explore the isomerization dynamics of the nanobeam , we examine the distribution of gap times on the dividing surface .",

    "for each case the gap time @xmath153 is also plotted along the line @xmath242 .",
    "a significant finding is that for case i the gap time is a smooth function of location on the ds ; although there appear to be no singularities inside the boundary ( nhim ) with divergent gap times , closer examination ( not shown here ) confirms the existence of a small region near the nhim ( the boundary of the ds ) where gap times are longer , presumably associated with second ( and later ) pulses that do not cross the ts on first approach but bounce back again one ( or more ) times .",
    "the absence of ` fractal ' patterns such as those seen in previous studies @xcite indicates that the intra - well dynamics is extremely simple for case i.    the gap time contours on the ds for cases ii and iii show a more typical @xcite fractal arrangement .",

    "the periodic orbits all have zero growth rates , and the saddle point and the homoclinic orbits will be discussed separately .",
    "we will show that the growth rates transverse to @xmath72 are exponential .",
    "hence they dominate the growth rates tangent to @xmath72 .",
    "we linearize about @xmath72 and evaluate the resulting equations on an arbitrary trajectory on @xmath72 . since @xmath72 is a plane , and is described in a global coordinate system , linearization about @xmath72 is particularly easy .",

    "this is accomplished by showing that has an _ exponential dichotomy _ , and these conditions will depend on @xmath255 .    the numbers that are typically used to quantify ( linearized ) growth rates of trajectories are the lyapunov exponents . however , for nonautonomous ordinary differential equations exponential dichotomies are often more convenient and facilitate the proof of certain results .",

    "<S> we analyze the dynamics of a model of a nanobeam under compression . </S>",
    "<S> the model is a two mode truncation of the euler - bernoulli beam equation subject to compressive stress applied at both ends . </S>",
    "<S> we consider parameter regimes where the first mode is unstable and the second mode can be either stable or unstable , and the remaining modes ( neglected ) are always stable . </S>",
    "<S> material parameters used correspond to a silicon nanobeam . </S>",
    "<S> the two mode model hamiltonian is the sum of a ( diagonal ) kinetic energy term and a potential energy term . </S>",
    "<S> the form of the potential energy function suggests an analogy with isomerisation reactions in chemistry , where ` isomerisation ' here corresponds to a transition between two stable beam configurations . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore study the dynamics of the buckled beam using the conceptual framework established for the theory of isomerisation reactions . </S>",
    "<S> when the second mode is stable the potential energy surface has an index one saddle and when the second mode is unstable the potential energy surface has an index two saddle and two index one saddles . </S>",
    "<S> symmetry of the system allows us to readily construct a phase space dividing surface between the two `` isomers '' ( buckled states ) ; we rigorously prove that , in a specific energy range , it is a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold . </S>",
    "<S> the energy range is sufficiently wide that we can treat the effects of the index one and index two saddles on the isomerisation dynamics in a unified fashion . </S>",
    "<S> we have computed reactive fluxes , mean gap times and reactant phase space volumes for three stress values at several different energies . in all cases the phase space volume swept out by isomerizing trajectories is considerably less than the reactant density of states , proving that the dynamics is highly nonergodic . </S>",
    "<S> the associated gap time distributions consist of one or more ` pulses ' of trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> computation of the reactive flux correlation function shows no sign of a plateau region ; rather , the flux exhibits oscillatory decay , indicating that , for the 2-mode model in the physical regime considered , a rate constant for isomerization does not exist . </S>"
