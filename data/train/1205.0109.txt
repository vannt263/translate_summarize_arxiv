    "more recently , the notion of the _ entanglement spectrum _ has provided a novel conceptual input to the field leading to new insights in the properties of various systems@xcite .",
    "these comprise quantum hall monolayers at fractional filling @xcite , quantum hall bilayers at filling factor @xmath2@xcite , spin systems of one @xcite and two @xcite spatial dimensions , and topological insulators @xcite .",
    "other topics recently covered include rotating bose - einstein condensates @xcite , coupled tomonaga - luttinger liquids @xcite , and systems of bose - hubbard@xcite and complex paired superfluids@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite poilblanc reported the observation that chain - chain entanglement spectra in two - leg spin-@xmath3 ladders are remarkably similar to the _ energy _ spectrum of a single spin-@xmath3 heisenberg chain .",
    "furthermore , the effective inverse temperature fitted to the data was found to depend on the ratio of the leg to the rung couplings and vanishes in the limit of strong rung coupling .",
    "subsequently , one of the present authors observed a similarly striking resemblance between the entanglement spectra of quantum hall bilayers at @xmath2 and the energy spectrum of a single physical layer at half filling.@xcite    in the case of isotropic spin-@xmath3 ladders the above observations were explained only shortly later by peschel and chung @xcite and by the present authors @xcite via first - order perturbation theory around the limit of strong rung coupling .",
    "moreover , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , an anisotropic spin-@xmath3 ladder will in general lead to an entanglement hamiltonian with renormalized anisotropy , and in second order perturbation theory further corrections to the entanglement hamiltonian occur .    in the present paper",
    "we extend the above results for isotropic heisenberg ladders to the case of arbitrary spin length @xmath0 .",
    "we find that the entanglement spectrum is still , within first order perturbation theory , proportional to the energy spectrum of the single chain .",
    "this is an remarkable result since important features of the latter spectra , such as presence or absence of an excitation gap over the ground state , depend crucially on the spin length.@xcite furthermore , the proportionality factor ( effective temperature ) between the entanglement spectrum and the single - chain energy spectrum spectrum turns out to be independent of the spin length .",
    "moreover , we also investigate @xmath4 ladders with uniaxial anisotropy . here",
    "we encounter the situation that already the unperturbed ground state is not fully entangled leading to a zero - order reduced density operator which is , differently from the @xmath5 case studied earlier@xcite , not proportional to the unit matrix .",

    "all spin-@xmath0 operators are taken to be dimensionless such that @xmath11 , @xmath12 have dimension of energy .",
    "the following considerations apply to finite systems with periodic boundary conditions as well as to those of infinite size .",
    "let us now treat @xmath13 as a perturbation to @xmath14 with antiferromagnetic coupling , @xmath15 .",
    "it is expected in general that the ground state of two leg spin @xmath0 ladders are gapped for finite @xmath15 and @xmath12 . for @xmath4 for example this has been verified numerically in ref .",

    "thus , as a special case of the wigner - eckart theorem , the states @xmath21 and @xmath22 are proportional to the triplet components @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , which are obtained readily by expliciting eqs .",

    "the unperturbed ground state on each rung remains , for not too large anisotropy , the fully entangled singlet state .",
    "this is no longer the case for larger spins since the anisotropic contribution to the hamiltonian couples the singlet to all higher multiplets with even total spin which will lead to a reduction of entanglement in the unperturbed ground state compared to the singlet state given in eqs .",

    "let us therefore return to the case of an isotropic heisenberg hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) along the rungs for again arbitrary spin length @xmath0 .",
    "as a perturbation we introduce the bilinear hamiltonian @xmath68 describing an arbitrarily anisotropic coupling between next neighbors encoded , using sum convention , in the matrix @xmath69 . using the relations",
    "@xmath70 and @xmath71 it is easy to see that the reduced density matrix in first order in @xmath32 is of the form ( [ rho1iso ] ) with @xmath72 thus , the entanglement hamiltonian in lowest nontrivial order perfectly reproduces the functional form of the perturbation along the legs .",
    "this result is easily generalized to the case of bilinear couplings of longer range , or spatially inhomogeneous couplings ( with the matrix a depending on lattice indices ) .",
    "the above finding ( [ hentaniso ] ) can be seen as the consequence of conditions already formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite : ( i ) full entanglement of the unperturbed ground state , and ( ii ) the perturbation couples only to a single energy level ( here the triplet ) of the unperturbed hamiltonian .",
    "the above observation that spin ladders with isotropic couplings have perturbative entanglement spectra allowing for simple interpretations , can be generalized to spin systems of other geometry . as an example , let us consider a dimerized spin-@xmath0 chain ( as opposed to a spin ladder ) described by @xmath6 with @xmath73 for simplicity and definiteness we assume a even number @xmath34 of lattice sites with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "thus , the ground state @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) of @xmath14 ( @xmath13 ) consists of singlets coupling each even ( odd ) lattice site to the site with next higher label .",
    "considering now @xmath13 as a perturbation to @xmath14 and tracing out all , say , odd lattice sites , one readily obtains a first - order reduced density matrix of the form ( [ rho1iso ] ) with @xmath76 here the missing factor of @xmath77 compared to eq .",

    "such states span the ground state space of the majumdar - ghosh spin chain.@xcite tracing out again the odd - labeled sites from @xmath81 leads to @xmath82 where the operator @xmath83 translates all spin states by one lattice site of the reduced chain .",
    "thus , the eigenstates @xmath84 of @xmath85 fulfill @xmath86 where the wave number @xmath87 is restricted to integer multiple of @xmath88 by the boundary conditions . in particular , the levels of the entanglement spectrum read as a function of @xmath87 @xmath89",

    "additional corrections are obtained in second order perturbation theory which are also fully evaluated . due to their proportionality ,",
    "the energy spectrum of a single spin chain and the entanglement spectrum of the ladder share the property of being gapless for half - integer spin length and gapful otherwise .",
    "this is in contrast to the energy spectrum of the full ladder which is , for large rung coupling , always gapped for any @xmath0 .",
