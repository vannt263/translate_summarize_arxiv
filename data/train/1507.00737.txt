    "following a hierarchical build - up , galaxy groups grow by accretion of smaller groups and isolated galaxies .",
    "tidal interactions tend to transfer mass from infalling galaxies to the ( new ) host group , with the former becoming group satellites .",
    "the favoured cosmological scenario posits that galaxies are embedded in larger dark matter haloes , with masses that largely exceed the stellar masses , a conclusion supported by a variety of observations ( see , e.g. , the reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "accordingly , satellite galaxies are hosted by ` subhaloes , ' whose masses and distribution contain information on the properties of dark matter itself ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    because dark matter is ( at least to a good approximation )",
    "dissipationless and baryons are not , it is subject to stronger tidal disruption than the baryonic component : energy losses cause baryons to sink to the centre of the potential more efficiently than dark matter , and therefore baryons are more resistant to tidal disruption @xcite .",
    "this latter fact produces a unique prediction of the dark matter hypothesis : a satellite galaxy will be preferentially stripped of its dark , rather than stellar , matter .",
    "thus , tidal stripping can be observed by comparing the total and stellar masses of satellite galaxies , such that galaxies accreted earlier have smaller mass - to - light ratios than galaxies accreted recently or ( central ) galaxies that have not been subject to tidal stripping by a larger host ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "numerical simulations predict that tidal stripping is stronger within more centrally concentrated host haloes , and is more severe for more massive satellites ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "different infall timescales and concentrations induced by baryons ( compared to dark matter - only simulations ) can alter both the radial distribution and density profiles of subhaloes , consequently affecting tidal stripping in a radially - dependent manner @xcite , although this baryon - induced radial dependence could plausibly be ( partially ) compensated by feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agn ; * ? ? ?",
    "observationally , the primary difficulty lies in estimating the total masses of satellite galaxies .",
    "weak gravitational lensing is currently the only option available to measure the total mass of statistical samples of galaxies .",
    "so - called ( weak ) galaxy - galaxy lensing provides a direct measure of the masses of lensing galaxies through the observation of their distortion of the images of background galaxies , without assumptions about the dynamical state of the system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "weak lensing is an intrinsically statistical observational measurement : outside the strong lensing regime ( typically a few tenths of arcsecond ) the distortion induced in each background galaxy is much smaller than the typical galaxy ellipticity .",
    "such measurements require high - quality multi - colour images that allow both accurate shape measurements and photometric redshift determination of faint , distant background sources .",
    "measuring the lensing signal around satellite galaxies ( hereafter  satellite lensing ",
    ", see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is particularly challenging because of i ) the small relative contribution of the satellite galaxy to the lensing signal produced by the host galaxy group ; ii ) source blending at small separations , which hampers our ability to measure shapes reliably ( and which is enhanced in high - density regions ) ; and iii ) particular sensitivity to contamination by field galaxies .",
    "this latter point is critical : since the dark matter haloes around satellite galaxies are expected to be stripped , isolated galaxies will significantly contaminate the lensing signal since they are not stripped , thus complicating a meaningful interpretation of the signal .",
    "therefore , satellite lensing requires a clean sample of satellite galaxies to allow a proper interpretation of the signal .",
    "satellite galaxies can usually be identified easily in massive galaxy clusters with high purity by use of , for instance , the red sequence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which in principle requires only two - band photometry .",
    "indeed , most satellite lensing measurements so far have concentrated on massive galaxy clusters with deep hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations in which bright cluster members can be easily identified @xcite , sometimes with the aid of strong lensing measurements @xcite .",
    "some of these studies have claimed detections of satellite truncation , but it seems likely that they are mostly attributable to the parameterization of subhalo density profiles rather than direct detections @xcite .",
    "because galaxy groups have fewer satellites than massive clusters , lensing measurements of galaxy group satellites require larger samples and have only been possible thanks to recent large optical surveys with high image quality . furthermore , because the red sequence is generally not so well established in galaxy groups compared to galaxy clusters , accurate group membership determination requires high - completeness spectroscopic observations .",
    "lacking such data , most measurements in galaxy groups to date have relied on more indirect means of estimating subhalo masses .",
    "@xcite used an optimized density estimator on galaxies selected from canada - france - hawaii telescope lensing survey ( cfhtlens , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and showed that the lensing signal of galaxies in high - density environments is inconsistent with the predictions of a model that does not include halo stripping , providing indirect evidence for tidal stripping in galaxy groups .",
    "such differentiation was only possible because their high - density environment galaxies were mostly satellites , due to their carefully calibrated density estimator .",
    "recently , @xcite presented the first direct detection of the lensing signal from satellite galaxies in galaxy groups .",
    "they took advantage of the overlap between deep imaging from the cfht - stripe82 survey ( cs82 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) data release 7 @xcite spectroscopic catalogue .",
    "@xcite used this sdss catalogue to construct a clean galaxy group catalogue with centrals and satellites identified individually ; although @xcite had only @xmath01,000 lens galaxies , their sample was essentially free of contamination by central galaxies .",
    "this allowed them to use weak lensing to directly measure the masses of satellites in galaxy groups for the first time , albeit with limited constraining power .",
    "in this paper we present a direct measurement of the lensing signal from satellite galaxies in galaxy groups by combining a sample of spectroscopically confirmed galaxy groups from the galaxy and mass assembly survey ( gama , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and background galaxies with high - quality shape measurements from the kilo - degree survey ( kids , * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "we use these measurements to constrain the masses of satellite galaxies as a function of projected distance from the group centre . by converting , in an average sense , these projected distances into 3-dimensional distances",
    ", we can study the evolution of satellite masses as they fall into galaxy groups .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in",
    "we describe the galaxy samples we use as lenses and lensed background sources . in we",
    "summarize the measurement of galaxy - galaxy lensing and describe our modelling of satellites and their host groups .",
    "we present our results in and summarize in .",
    "we adopt a flat @xmath6cdm cosmology with @xmath7 , consistent with the latest cosmic microwave background measurements @xcite , and @xmath8 .",
    "we explicitly include the dependence on @xmath9 where appropriate . throughout",
    "we use the symbol @xmath10 to refer to the median of distribution @xmath11 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,>,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we detect the signal from satellites with significances @xmath1299% in all three radial bins .",
    "satellite masses are consistent across radial bins .",

    "also shows the subhalo mass as a function of 3-dimensional separation from the group centre found in numerical simulations by @xcite .",
    "note that we compare here only the trend with radius , not the normalization .",
    "fitting a power law , @xmath15 , to the data in we find @xmath16 ( ignoring horizontal errorbars ) , consistent with the trend predicted by @xcite but also with no dependence on group - centric distance .",
    "the bottom panel shows the average stellar mass fractions , which are also consistent with each other , @xmath17 .",
    "we also show in the results obtained for the truncated theoretical model .",
    "the difference between each pair of points depends on the posterior @xmath18 estimated in each bin through . specifically , we estimate @xmath19mpc .",
    "we remind the reader that these are theoretical predictions from rather than observational results . for comparison",
    ", we also show in the masses obtained by integrating the posterior nfw models up to said truncation radii , shown by the dashed line .",
    "these masses are fully consistent with the truncated model , implying that the difference between the black and grey points ( which show @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively ) in is only a matter of presentation ; the data can not distinguish between these two models .    after we submitted this work",
    ", @xcite presented similar , independent satellite lensing measurements .",
    "they used @xmath07,000 satellites in the redmapper galaxy group catalogue @xcite with background sources from cs82 and also measured the lensing signal in three bins in projected radius .",
    "they find comparable constraints that are consistent with ours .",
    "we can link the results presented in to predictions from numerical simulations .",
    "comparisons of the satellite populations of observed galaxies ( or groups ) provide valuable insights as to the relevant physical processes that dominate galaxy formation , as highlighted by the well known ` missing satellites ' @xcite and ` too big to fail ' @xcite problems , which suggest either that our universe is not well described by a @xmath6cdm cosmology , or that using numerical simulations to predict observations is more complicated than anticipated . while the former may in fact be true ,",
    "the latter is now well established , as the formation of galaxies inside dark matter haloes depends strongly on baryonic physics not included in @xmath22-body simulations , and the influence of baryons tends to alleviate these problems @xcite .    here",
    "we specifically compare the average subhalo - to - host mass ratio , @xmath23 , to @xmath6cdm predictions through the subhalo mass function , which describes the mass distributions of subhaloes for a given dark matter halo mass . in numerical simulations ,",
    "the resulting subhalo mass function is a function only of @xmath24 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as summarized in , we find typical subhalo - to - host mass ratios in the range @xmath25 , statistically consistent across group - centric distance .",
    "we obtain these values by taking the ratio @xmath26 at every evaluation in the mcmc . for comparison , the values we obtain using the truncated model are @xmath27 , also consistent across radial bins .",
    "we compare our results to the analytical _ evolved _ ( that is , measured after the subhaloes have become satellites of the host halo , as opposed to one measured at the time of infall ) subhalo mass function proposed by @xcite , @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and calculate the average subhalo - to - host mass ratio , @xmath31^{-1 }      \\int_{\\psi_{\\rm min}}^{\\psi_{\\rm max } } \\psi\\frac{{\\rm d}n}{{\\rm d}\\psi}{\\rm d}\\psi,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is approximately the minimum fractional satellite mass we observe given the results of , and @xmath33 is the maximum fractional satellite mass by definition .",
    "integrating in this range gives @xmath34 .",
    "there are many uncertainties involved in choosing a @xmath35 representative of our sample , such as survey incompleteness and the conversion between stellar and total mass ; we defer a proper modelling of these uncertainties to future work . for reference ,",
    "changing @xmath35 by a factor 5 modifies the predicted @xmath36 by a factor @xmath03 .",
    "considering the uncertainties involved , all we can say at present is that our results are consistent with @xmath6cdm predictions .",
    "two sources of contamination in the group catalogue have been neglected in this analysis .",
    "the spectroscopic group satellite catalogue used in this work has a high , but not 100% , purity .",
    "for groups with @xmath37 the purity approaches 90% ; groups with fewer members have significantly lower purity @xcite .",
    "@xcite have shown that a contamination fraction of 10% in the satellite sample would lead to a @xmath38 bias in the inferred satellite masses , well within the reported uncertainties ( which amount to up to a factor two ) .",
    "the second source of contamination is the misidentification of the central galaxy in a group , such that the true central galaxy would be included in our satellite sample .",
    "this effect is similar to that explained above , except that contaminating galaxies now reside in particularly massive halos ( namely , the groups themselves ) .",
    "based on comparisons to gama mock galaxy catalogues , @xcite found that the fraction of bcgs correctly identified with the central galaxy of dark matter halos is around @xmath39 for groups with @xmath37 . @xcite",
    "have directly measured the offset probability of bcgs from the true minimum of the potential well .",
    "they found that the bcg is as good a proxy for the centre as the iterative centre of @xcite , which according to mock group catalogues are well centred in @xmath40 of the groups .",
    "there are very few groups with @xmath41 @xcite , and therefore the lensing signal of a central galaxy in our sample would probably have @xmath42 ( see figure 7 of * ? ? ?",
    "if we assume ( conservatively ) that 20% of the bcgs do not correspond to the central galaxy in their groups , then @xmath43 ( where @xmath44 , cf .  ) of our satellites would be central galaxies .",
    "therefore the total signal in the inner regions ( @xmath45 ) would be @xmath46 , which yields @xmath47 . therefore central galaxy misidentification induces a @xmath48 bias on the signal , which implies roughly a @xmath38 bias on the mass .",
    "together , these two effects add up to a @xmath49 bias in our satellite mass estimates .",
    "such a bias is safely within our statistical uncertainties .",
    "therefore our results are insensitive to plausible levels of contamination in the group catalogue , both from satellites that are not really group members and from misidentified central galaxies .",
    "we used the first 100  of optical imaging from kids to measure the excess surface mass density around spectroscopically confirmed satellite galaxies from the gama galaxy group catalogue .",
    "we model the signal assuming nfw profiles for both host groups and satellite galaxies , including the contribution from the stellar mass for the latter in the form of a point source . taking advantage of the combination of statistical power and high image quality , we split the satellite population into three bins in projected separation from the group centre , which serves as a ( high - scatter ) proxy for the time since infall .",
    "we fit the data with a model that includes the satellite and group contributions using an mcmc ( see and ) , fully accounting for the data covariance . as a consistency check , we find group masses in good agreement with the weak lensing study of gama galaxy groups by @xcite , even though we do not account for effects such as miscentring or the contribution from stars in the bcg .",
    "this model fits the data well , with @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "we are able to constrain total satellite masses to within @xmath52 dex or better . given these uncertainties , the estimated masses are insensitive to the levels of contamination expected in the group catalogue .",
    "satellite galaxies have similar masses across group - centric distance , consistent with what is found in numerical simulations ( accounting for the measured uncertainties ) .",
    "satellite masses as a function of group - centric distance are influenced by a number of effects .",
    "tidal stripping acts more efficiently closer to the group centre , while dynamical friction makes massive galaxies sink to the centre more efficiently , an effect referred to as mass segregation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , by binning the sample in ( projected ) group - centric distance we are introducing a selection effect such that outer bins include generally more massive groups , which will then host more massive satellites on average . future studies with increased precision may be able to shed light on the interplay between these effects by , for instance , selecting samples residing in the same host groups or in bins of stellar mass .    as a proof of concept",
    ", we compare our results to predictions from @xmath22-body simulations .",
    "these predict that the subhalo mass function is a function only of the fractional subhalo mass , @xmath53 .",
    "our binning in satellite group - centric distance produces a selection effect on host groups , such that each bin probes a ( slightly ) different group population , which allows us to test such prediction .",
    "the average fractional mass in all three bins is consistent with a single value ( within large errorbars ) , @xmath25 .",
    "this is broadly consistent with the predictions of numerical simulations .",
    "we anticipate that weak lensing of satellite galaxies will become an important tool to constrain the physical processes incorporated in semi - analytic models of galaxy formation and , ultimately , hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "we thank martin eriksen , joachim harnois - draps and thomas kitching for useful comments on the manuscript .",
    "we are grateful to matthias bartelmann for being our external blinder , revealing which of the four catalogues analysed was the true unblinded catalogue at the end of this study .",

    "as mentioned in , we calculate the covariance matrix directly from the data including only the contribution from shape noise ( see section 3.4 of * ? ? ?",
    "in we show the corresponding correlation matrix , defined as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the covariance between the @xmath56-th and @xmath57-th elements of radial bins @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively ( where @xmath60 ) . in reality",
    "the lensing covariance also includes a contribution from sample ( ` cosmic ' ) variance , but we have ignored it in our analysis .",
    "below we justify this decision .    the contribution from sample variance",
    "can in principle be estimated by bootstrapping the lensing signal over individual kids fields . however , there are two caveats to this approach",
    ". first , the 101 kids fields used here do not produce enough independent bootstrap samples to properly estimate the full covariance matrix for our satellite samples , which is a symmetric @xmath61 matrix ( containing 648 independent elements ) including sample variance for the three radial bins .",
    "second , using single kids fields as bootstrap elements means that the elements are not truly independent from each other , because lenses in one field do contribute to signal in neighbouring fields .",
    "in fact , we calculate the lensing signal of each galaxy including background galaxies in neighbouring fields .",
    "the latter point is not crucial for our analysis since , as shown in , the signal produced by satellite subhaloes is confined to the smallest scales , @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , we can estimate the relative contribution from sample variance to the covariance matrix by comparing the diagonal sub - panels of the covariance matrices estimated directly from the data ( the ` analytical ' covariance ) and by bootstrapping over kids fields .",
    "note that the bootstrap covariance also accounts for shape noise in addition to sample variance .",
    "therefore the ratio between the bootstrap and analytical covariances is a measure of the relative contribution of sample variance to the satellite lensing covariance .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the bootstrap covariance can be biased high by as much as 40% @xcite .",
    "we show this comparison in for each of the three radial bins , where we compare @xmath63 estimated from the analytic ( i.e. , data ) and bootstrap covariances .",
    "both methods lead to similar values up to the largest angular separations .",
    "there is a hint of a nonzero contribution from sample variance at scales @xmath64 , where the bootstrap variance is @xmath65 larger than the analytical variance . as stated above , the satellite contribution to @xmath66",
    "is confined to scales smaller than these .",
    "we conclude that , for the purpose of this work , we can safely ignore sample variance ."
