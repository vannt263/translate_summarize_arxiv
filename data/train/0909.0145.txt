    "inspired by the randall - sundrum models @xcite , there has recently been considerable interest in the casimir effect in higher - dimensional space .",
    "we may recall the characteristic features of this model : in the first variant , called rsi , one assumes that we are living on a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional subspace called a 3-brane , separated from an additional hidden brane by a bulk region .",
    "only gravity is assumed to propagate in the bulk .",
    "the extra dimension is a circle @xmath1 with radius @xmath2 , represented by a coordinate @xmath3 in the range @xmath4 .",
    "the hidden and the visible branes are located at @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "imposition of @xmath7 symmetry means that the points @xmath8 and @xmath9 are identified . in the second variant of the model , rsii",
    ", the hidden brane is sent to infinity .",
    "the major difference between the rs model and other higher - dimensional models lies in the warp factor @xmath10 in the metric @xmath11 where @xmath12diag(1,-1,-1,-1 ) is the minkowski metric of flat spacetime and @xmath13 is a constant of order @xmath14 , the planck mass .",
    "the warp factor plays an important role helping to solve the hierarchy problem without introducing additional hierarchies .",
    "whereas in the original rs model the fields of the standard model ( sm ) as mentioned were confined to the visible brane only , the possibility of having additional fields in the bulk was soon investigated , beginning with scalar fields @xcite introduced to stabilize the inter brane distance .",
    "subsequently , the possibility of having other fields , such as fermion field @xcite , gauge fields @xcite , or even the full assembly of sm fields @xcite , was investigated .",

    "the first group working on this was frank _",
    "_ , publishing two papers @xcite on the casimir force in both the rsi / rsii and the rsi - q / rsii - q models . here",
    "rsi - q and rsii - q refer to generalizing the 3-branes on rsi / rsii to @xmath15-branes ( this kind of generalization will however not be dealt with in the present paper ) .",
    "there are also two papers of the group of morales - tcotl _ et al . _",

    "the ones most similar in nature to that of the present work are those of teo @xcite .",
    "she calculated the temperature casimir force ; not , however , the casimir free energy .",
    "as already mentioned we will assume a scalar field @xmath16 in the bulk .",
    "both the rsi and the rsii models will be considered .",
    "formally , the expressions pertaining to the rsii case may be derived by letting @xmath17 in the rsi expressions .",
    "the use of a scalar field makes of course the situation more unphysical that what would be the case by assuming an electromagnetic field in the bulk .",
    "but we avoid the complications arising from photon spin in higher - dimensional spacetimes ( for some recent papers in that direction see , for instance , refs .",
    "the conflict is not even resolved when we have only one extra spatial dimension and spacetime is _",
    "flat_. on one hand we have e.g. poppenhaeger _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and pascoal _ et al .",
    "they find the electromagnetic casimir force by multiplying the scalar field expressions by a factor @xmath18 ( to account for the possible polarisations of the photon ) and subtract the mode polarised in the direction of the brane . on the other hand we have edery and marachevsky @xcite who start out with decomposition of the five - dimensional maxwell action .",
    "this conflict in not the central issue of this paper , and we avoid it by consider scalar fields only .",
    "our main purpose will be to calculate the casimir free energy and the casimir force for the rsi model , when there are two parallel plates with separation @xmath0 on the visible brane .",

    "the attractiveness versus the repulsiveness of the temperature corrections for different boundary corrections at low temperature are of definite physical interest and are therefore pointed out .",
    "we regularize infinite expressions by using zeta functions and the abel - plana summation formula , as this formula turns out to be better suited to the problem than the more commonly used euler - maclaurin formula .",

    "we discuss the distinction between even and odd fields , and consider also the mode localization problem . after a brief survey of the abel - plana formula in section 3 we consider in section 4 the dirichlet - dirichlet ( dd ) , neumann - neumann ( nn ) , and dirichlet - neumann ( dn ) boundary conditions in flat space , at finite temperature without extra dimensions .",
    "our main topic , the temperature rsi case , is covered in section 5 , where the casimir free energy and force are calculated for the different boundary conditions .",
    "a brief treatment of the rsii case is given in section 6 .",
