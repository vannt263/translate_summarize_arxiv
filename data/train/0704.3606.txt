    "observations suggest that the universe is currently dominated by a dark energy phase , which accounts for the apparent acceleration @xcite",
    ". however this can not be reconciled within conventional cosmology , and therefore provides an important theoretical challenge @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation for this dark energy is that there exists a non - zero cosmological constant , implying that we are currently in a de sitter phase .",
    "the origins of such a constant have been the focus of much recent work in flux compactifications of superstring and m - theory ( see @xcite and the references therein . ) .",
    "an alternative proposal is that the energy density of the universe is currently dominated by a phantom scalar field , which has a canonical scalar lagrangian albeit with the wrong sign in the kinetic term @xcite .",
    "this leads to a violation of the weak energy condition such that @xmath5 .",
    "the physical origins of such a field , however , remain problematic at best since the hamiltonian is unbounded from below which means that a stable vacuum state may not exist upon quantization of the theory .",
    "in addition is was shown that phantom fields must have minimal , or zero , interactions with other matter - and that they themselves must only interact gravitationally @xcite .",
    "however see @xcite for a potential resolution to the phantom problem .",
    "one resolution to this problem is that the phantom fields may only exist temporarily , which is what we will assume in this note ( although we should point out that these kind of fields can naturally arise within certain string theories , most notablytype ii * string theory @xcite ) .",
    "let us imagine that the kinetic term in the lagrangian has some moduli space metric @xmath6 multiplying the derivative terms such that we have a term @xmath7 .",
    "usually one takes the metric to be positive definite , however let us assume that there is some region of moduli space where it has a negative eigenvalue .",
    "thus any fields @xmath8 entering this region will have negative kinetic energy , at least for the duration of time that the field find itself in this region of moduli space @xcite .",
    "it is _ this _ region that we shall consider in this note which therefore implies that we expect the current dark energy phase to be a transient phenomenon .",
    "see @xcite for related issues .",
    "of course the scalar field may be remain in this region for a long time , and thefore the accelerating phase may appear to be long lived .    in a typical friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) model exhibiting a dark energy , or phantom phase , such a universe will contain a future singularity . in",
    "this type of singularity , referred to as a type i singularity @xcite , both the energy density @xmath9 of the dark energy and the hubble parameter diverge within a _",
    "finite time_. clearly this is undesirable from a physical perspective , and so many authors have tried to resolve these future singularities @xcite . although there has been much progress in resolving initial singularities in string theory , future singularities are problematic .",
    "this is because the low energy solutions of perturbative string theory simply match onto the standard frw cosmologies .",
    "therefore we are motivated to move beyond this approach to search for other solutions .",
    "of course we may find additional corrections once a fully consistent non - perturbative description has been realized .",
    "an alternative approach to quantum gravity is via loop quantum gravity . in this theory",
    "non - perturbative effects lead to @xmath10 corrections to the standard friedmann equation and thus allow us the possibility of resolving any future singularities @xcite .",
    "it is this non - canonical dependence upon the energy density that leads to interesting physical behavior , particularly when the energy density is near the critical density @xmath11 . as such backgrounds of this type deserve further investigation .",
    "recently it was observed that these non - perturbative corrections can lead to the future oscillation of @xmath12 between finite values , implying that neither the scale factor nor the energy density diverge .",
    "instead both parameters become oscillatory and bounded at finite value @xcite , thus avoiding any future singularities .    another interesting correction to the friedman equation",
    "can be seen in studies of braneworld cosmology @xcite , where there is a @xmath10 correction which has the opposite sign to the loop background . in",
    "transpires that there is an interesting and highly non - trivial duality between these solutions @xcite suggesting that the two models are related to one another .    in this note",
    "we will study the qualitative differences between the loop and braneworld inspired solutions , and their potential consequences for the evolution of the universe .",
    "we will see that in the loop case the hubble parameter behaves as a damped harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath13 , however in the brane case the oscillation frequency rapidly becomes complex and the hubble parameter is frozen at a constant value although this avoids the type i singularity , the scale factor continues to diverge and therefore we do not resolve the singularity issue .",
    "note : upon completion of this work we learnt of the paper by @xcite which investigates a similar issue . the conclusions reached",
    "there are similar to those presented here . in both cases",
    "we emphasis that the hubble parameter can become oscillatory , although our analysis shows that this will only be true for a specific class of phantom potentials .",
    "we also highlight the similarity between this model , and that coming from a braneworld motivated one .",
    "the energy density @xmath9 and pressure @xmath14 of a phantom field are defined by the following components of the energy momentum tensor @xmath15 and the equation of motion @xmath16 this is enough to specify the dynamics of the minimally coupled phantom field coupled to standard einstein gravity .",
    "the standard friedmann equation , in terms of the reduced planck mass @xmath17 , is simply @xmath18 however non - perturbative loop quantum gravity effects modify this to read @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the critical energy density . here",
    "@xmath22 is the barbero - immirizi parameter which arises from the poisson bracket of the conjugate connection @xmath23 and the triad @xmath14 , through the relation @xmath24 .",
    "numerically @xmath22 is typically fixed to be small .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite for a detailed account of the quantization procedure for such a theory . combining these",
    "we can write the derivative of @xmath12 with respect to time @xmath25 as usual in these problems it is easier to work in terms of dimensionless variables , so we make the following definitions @xmath26 and using these dimensionless quantities we see from ( [ friedman ] , [ hdot ] ) that the dimensionless equations of motion become . @xmath27 we want to re - write these expressions in an autonomous form , so it is convenient to define the following variables @xmath28 and thus the autonomous equations of motion can be written @xmath29 additionally we see that the friedmann equation in dimensionless variables becomes simply @xmath30 the non - negativity of this last expression implies that @xmath31 $ ] or in terms of the variable @xmath32 we see that this must lie in the closed set @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "the variables are constrained , and not independent which is why the hubble parameter never becomes imaginary even when @xmath34 .",
    "this can be demonstrated graphically using a monte carlo simulation and shown in the figure below    as we move away from the origin we see that @xmath35 becomes proportional to @xmath36 as expected from our analytic argument .",
    "since @xmath37 is the dimensionless potential for the phantom field this indicates that we should find scaling solutions when @xmath38 , so that we can neglect all @xmath39 terms as being negligibly small .",
    "importantly we can write the acceleration of the hubble parameter in the following form using ( [ eq : dimlesseom ] ) @xmath40 where we have defined @xmath41 we see that @xmath42 is a damped , harmonic oscillatory function with frequency @xmath13 and damping factor @xmath22 .",
    "this is an important result , since this implies that @xmath12 can oscillate and therefore avoid future singularities .",
    "the damping factor scale is set by @xmath43 , and decreases as @xmath36 increases , therefore one would expect the damping to die away as a function of time .",
    "the frequency is an ever increasing function of @xmath36 provided that @xmath44 , which is a reality condition .",
    "one can see that the frequency will never become complex , because the value of @xmath36 is constrained by the value of @xmath35 .",
    "again we can confirm the validity of said assumption using monte carlo techniques    therefore it would appear that at late times @xmath12 oscillates more rapidly , becoming a simple harmonic oscillator .",
    "schematically we see that the friedmann equation looks like @xmath45 , and so we deduce that @xmath46 must also be an oscillatory function .",
    "we can define an effective equation of state for the phantom field in the usual manner @xmath47 which essentially tells us that phantom dominated solutions require @xmath48 since all dependence on the potential vanishes when we look at violations of the weak energy principle . despite this",
    ", we know that the kinematics of the phantom field are determined by the form of the scalar potential . therefore we should try to analyze the equations of motion with this in mind .",
    "there are essentially three cases of interest which we label as @xmath49 @xmath50 const .",
    "@xmath52 asymptotically and @xmath53 @xmath54 asymptotically which we will discuss in turn .",
    "this case implies three the existence of three different possibilities .",
    "firstly we could take @xmath56 , which essentially implies that @xmath57 or that the potential is a constant .",
    "the second possibility is that @xmath34 , but this means that the phantom field is constant and does nt permit dynamical solutions .",
    "the third and final possibility is that @xmath58 which uniquely fixes the form of the potential to be of the form @xmath59 , where @xmath60 are positive or negative constants of the appropriate dimension .",
    "a nice illustration of the expected oscillatory behavior is shown in figure 3 , where we use the potential @xmath61 to illustrate the general behaviour .",
    "note that the hubble parameter initially undergoes a bounce , before settling into an oscillatory phase .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations varies rapidly between @xmath62 .",
    "similarly the energy density settles into an oscillatory phase , after initially increasing towards its maximal value .",
    "it is important to note that the hubble parameter is approximately constant or slowly decreasing for much of the initial evolution , therefore there will be virtually no corresponding change in the amount of gravitational wave production . eventually the hubble parameter reaches zero , at which point is moves into its oscillatory period ( with a fixed amplitude ) , but oscillating about the zero point .",
    "this will therefore lead to an oscillatory signal for the gravitational waves produced , with an ever decreasing period .",
    "this oscillation is expected to be eternal @xcite .",
    "physically the bounce is due to the way the energy density is distributed into kinetic and potential energies .",
    "the potential energy of the field is always positive , and initially dominates the negative kinetic energy of the rolling field , which is why the energy density is an initially increasing function .",
    "however eventually the field starts to roll rapidly and therefore the kinetic energy contribution starts to become dominant .",
    "oscillation in the velocity thus makes the total energy density oscillatory , which in turn forces the hubble parameter to oscillate about the bounce point .",
    "const , using a potential given by @xmath63.,width=491,height=340 ]    let us initially assume that @xmath64 .",
    "in fact the only fixed point solution can be see to be @xmath65 - which is essentially the most trivial case because the energy density is zero .",
    "we can actually solve the equations of motion in this instance .",
    "we see that @xmath36 is constant , and that the boundary term for the velocity must satisfy the equation @xmath66 .",
    "however the equation of state at this point must be evaluated as a limit @xmath67 in order to avoid singularities .",
    "in fact this particular limit can be shown to be non - existent when one applies the tests for multivariable functions , therefore the equation of state is undefined in this instance .",
    "let us now consider solutions with @xmath68 , which implies that the fixed point is again at @xmath69 if we assume that the phantom field does nt have complex velocity .",
    "the more interesting case is to set @xmath70 , which implies that the following critical points exist @xmath71 and @xmath72 , with @xmath36 taken to be arbitrary .",
    "the point @xmath73 admits a constant equation of state - namely @xmath74 consistent with a dark energy dominated phase rather than a phantom phase .",
    "the point @xmath75 leads to a divergent equation of state with @xmath76 for all non - zero positive @xmath36 .",
    "the final fixed point actually leads to the solution @xmath77 and therefore to a whole range of phantom like behavior provided that @xmath78 .",
    "solutions to the equation of motion can be obtained numerically , however they show that @xmath79 as a function of time , and that @xmath80 from below .",
    "let us now examine the stability of the solution by considering perturbations around the critical points of the dynamical equations , where we assume the perturbation is small @xmath81 we wish to determine the perturbed equations of motion to leading order .",
    "the only non - trivial expression we need to determine is the perturbed friedmann equation .",
    "if we denote @xmath82 , i.e the friedmann equation evaluated at the fixed points - then we can write the perturbed solution as follows @xmath83 we now insert this into the original equations of motion and expand to linear order in the perturbations",
    ". we can write the resultant differential equations for the perturbed solutions as a matrix equation where we define a perturbation vector @xmath84 , and a perturbation matrix @xmath85 satisfying @xmath86 whose eigenvalues determine the stability of the solution in question .",
    "a brief calculation yields the following solution for the eigenvalues .",
    "let us first define the function @xmath87 through the relation @xmath88 + \\\\   & + & 9[2y_c^2 - 1-x_c^2]^2x_c^2(x_c+2y_c^2)^2 + \\tilde h_c^2 \\left\\lbrace18x_c(x_c+2y_c[2y_c^2 - 1-x_c^2]+\\lambda^2y_c(x_c+4y_c))\\right\\rbrace \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in terms of which we can write the eigenvalues as follows @xmath89 - 2\\tilde h_c \\lambda y_c \\pm f^{1/2}(x_c , y_c)\\ ] ] the system can be regarded as being stable ( at least to linear order in the perturbations ) when both eigenvalues are negative definite in the first instance where we have @xmath90 the eigenvalues are in fact undefined , since there is no possible path through phase space that leads to a convergent solution .",
    "this should have been anticipated from the form of @xmath91 , which can not be defined in this limit .    the non - trivial case where we have @xmath92 leads to different solutions . for the point @xmath93",
    "we find that the eigenvalues are @xmath94 implying that this point is a stable node provided we take the positive sign for the hubble parameter .",
    "the remaining fixed points correspond to @xmath95 and @xmath96 and yield zero eigenvalues .",
    "this means that they are both saddle points in phase space .",
    "we summarise the results in this section in the following table :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table 2 .",
    "summary of the fixed points and equation of state for the case of constant @xmath43 for the braneworld case .",
    "in this note we studied the dynamics of a phantom driven universe both in a loop and braneworld background .",
    "we found the hubble parameter @xmath42 and the dark energy density @xmath46 remain finite in future and hence avoid a type i singularity for the loop case , however in the braneworld case we see that the scale factor can still diverge due to the fact that the frequency of the oscillation becomes complex .",
    "we analyzed the fixed points of the equations of motion in both cases and found that there were two non - trivial solutions , and two trivial ( in the sense that they correspond to @xmath97 ) solutions .",
    "the first non - trivial solution is undefined in both cases , whilst the second is a stable fixed point with the appropriate choice of sign .",
    "the trivial solutions both correspond to flat directions , even though that they are located at different points in the @xmath98 phase plane .",
    "our study of the loop background was for a general phantom potential , however we saw that the equations of motion impose restrictions on the allowed form of such potentials .",
    "the most interesting solution corresponds to the @xmath55 const , of which the @xmath92 solution is a subset .",
    "potentials satisfying this condition lead to simple harmonic motion for @xmath99 in the far future , and are therefore capable of resolving all future singularities . on the other hand , the asymptotic cases where @xmath100 should appear to be oscillatory only for a finite time .",
    "eventually the equations of motion force the damping factor to dominate at late times , and the system will be fixed at some value .",
    "of course this bounce appears to pass through the point @xmath101 which is where we would anticipate quantum gravity effects to become important .    in the braneworld case",
    "we can again use @xmath43 to parameterise the solutions , however the hubble parameter quickly freezes out to become constant because of the reality constraint on the oscillation frequency - even when @xmath92 .",
    "this means that this the braneworld case is similar to the late time behavior of the asymptotic loop case . in the asymptotic cases",
    "@xmath102 we see that again the damping factor will dominate at late times , and therefore kill off all oscillatory solutions , exactly as in the loop case .",
    "therefore we conclude that only when we have constant @xmath43 can we be sure of avoiding all future singularities . in the other cases it is likely that the type ii singularity ( @xmath103 ) could still occur @xcite ,",
    "although the sudden singularity @xcite is regarded as being a far weaker singularity .",
    "the rapid oscillation of @xmath42 and @xmath46 in the loop case leads to some interesting cosmological phenomenon .",
    "this may cause late time particle production and therefore provides a useful falsifiable prediction compared to the braneworld scenario .",
    "there will certainly be an observable gravitational wave signature due to the oscillatory nature of @xmath12 , however the precise physical predictions are dependent upon the choice of the potential , and therefore depend heavily upon the physical origin of such a phantom field . in both cases",
    "we have assumed that the evolution of the universe is governed by a transient phantom phase , and that eventually this phase will come to an end .",
    "however this may be problematic , since it was argued in @xcite that one can not find trajectories where the eigenvalues of the metric tensor take the opposite sign .",
    "one way to avoid this is to consider a large number of phantom fields , in which case it may be possible for the moduli space metric to acquire an opposite sign",
    ". a detailed analysis of this conjecture would certainly be most welcome .",
    "however it is important to understand the differences between the brane and loop solutions during this temporary phase of phantom domination .",
    "assuming that the phantom phase is transient allows us to consider more general corrections to the friedmann equation , such as those arising in cardassian models @xcite or the dgp model @xcite .",
    "it is important to understand the distinguish between the different physical predictions of these theories in order to understand whether all future singularities can be resolved .",
