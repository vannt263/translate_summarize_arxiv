    "in contrast to hadro - production of charmonia , where the mechanism is still debated , electro(photo)production of charmonia seems better understood : the @xmath2 fluctuation of the incoming real or virtual photon interacts with the target ( proton or nucleus ) via the dipole cross section @xmath3 and the result is projected on the wave function of the observed hadron @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is not to propose a conceptually new scheme , but to calculate within this approach as accurately as possible and without any free parameters . wherever there is room for arbitrariness , like form for the color dipole cross section and for for charmonium wave function",
    ", we use and compare other author s proposals , which have been tested on different data .    in the light - cone",

[ fig - gp ] @xcite .    the corresponding expression for the forward amplitude reads [ mgp ] m_p(s , q^2 ) = _ , | _ 0 ^ 1 dd^2 ^(,| ) _ ( , ) ( , s ) ^(,|)_(,,q^2 ) .",
    "here the summation runs over spin indexes @xmath7 , @xmath8 of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 quarks , @xmath1 is the photon virtuality , @xmath11 is the lc distribution function of the photon for a @xmath2 fluctuation of separation @xmath12 and relative fraction @xmath13 of the photon lc momentum carried by @xmath9 or @xmath10 . correspondingly , @xmath14 is the lc wave function of @xmath5 or @xmath6 . the dipole cross section @xmath15 mediates the transition .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we review the expressions of the factorized lc approach to electroproduction of heavy quarkonia ( more details one can find in @xcite ) and then compare with available experimental data for @xmath16 production .",
    "the calculations which are parameter free demonstrate good agreement with data .",
    "after it we analyse exclusive electroproduction of charmonia off nuclei @xmath17 , where @xmath18 ( coherent ) or @xmath19 ( incoherent , where @xmath20 is an exited state of the @xmath21-nucleon system ) . in these processes",
    "new phenomena are to be expected .",
    "( i ) color filtering , i.e. inelastic interactions of the @xmath2 pair on its way through the nucleus is expected to lead to a suppression of @xmath4 production relative to @xmath22 .",
    "( ii ) production of a @xmath2 pair in a nucleus and its absorption are also determined by the values of the coherence length ( lifetime of the @xmath2 fluctuation ) , [ lc ] l_c = , where @xmath23 is the energy of the virtual photon in the rest frame of the nucleus .",
    "( iii ) since the dipole cross section @xmath3 also depends on the gluon distribution in the target ( @xmath24 of @xmath21 ) , nuclear shadowing of the gluon distribution is expected to reduce @xmath3 in a nuclear reaction relative to the one on the proton .",
    "the predictions in this paper may be used for planning of future experiments for electron - nucleus collisions at high energies like in the erhic project . another possibility",
    "to observe photoproduction off nuclei is heavy ion relativistic collisions ( see , for example , review @xcite ) . in the last section we present our results for @xmath5 production in such processes .",
    "the lc variable describing longitudinal motion of the quarks is the fraction @xmath25 of the photon lc momentum @xmath26 carried by the quark or antiquark .",
    "@xmath13 is lorentz - boost invariant . in the nonrelativistic approximation ( assuming no relative motion of @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) @xmath27 ( e.g. @xcite ) , otherwise one should integrate over @xmath13 ( see eq .  ) .",
    "for transversely ( @xmath28 ) and longitudinally ( @xmath29 ) polarized photons the perturbative photon - quark distribution function in eq",
    ".   reads @xcite , [ psi - g ] _ t , l^(,|)(,,q^2 ) = z_c _ c^o_t , l _ |c^|k_0 ( )  , where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the spinors of the @xmath9-quark and antiquark respectively ; @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 is the modified bessel function with @xmath35 .",
    "the operators @xmath36 have the form : o_t & = & m_c e _ + i(1 - 2 ) ( n ) ( e _ _ ) + ( n e _ ) _  , + o_l & = & 2q(1-)n  , where @xmath37 is a unit vector parallel to the photon momentum and @xmath38 is the polarization vector of the photon .",
    "effects of the non - perturbative interaction within the @xmath39 fluctuation are negligible for the heavy charmed quarks .      the charmonium wave function is well defined in its rest frame where one can rely on the schrdinger equation .",
    "as soon as the rest frame wave function is known , one may be tempted to apply the lorentz transformation to the @xmath2 pair as it would be a classical system and boost it to the infinite momentum frame . however , quantum effects are important and in the infinite momentum frame a series of different fock states emerges from the lorentz boost . therefore the lowest @xmath40 component in the infinite momentum frame does not represent the @xmath40 in the rest frame .",
    "we rely on the widely used procedure @xcite for the generation of the lc wave functions of charmonia .    in the rest frame the spatial part of the @xmath2 pair wave function satisfying the schrdinger equation [ schroed ] ( -+v(r ) ) _",

    "the following four potentials @xmath44 have been used    * `` cor '' : cornell potential @xcite , [ cor ] v(r ) = - + with @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "* `` bt '' : potential suggested by buchmller and tye @xcite with @xmath48 .",
    "it has a similar structure as the cornell potential : linear string potential at large separations and coulomb shape at short distances with some refinements , however .",
    "* `` log '' : logarithmic potential @xcite [ log ] v(r ) = -0.6635 + ( 0.733 ) ( r 1 ) with @xmath49 . *",

    "note , however , that cor and pow use @xmath54 , while bt and log use @xmath55 for the mass of the charmed quark .",
    "this difference will have significant consequences .    for the ground state",
    "@xmath56 all the potentials provide a very similar behavior for the radial part @xmath42 at @xmath57 , while for small @xmath51 the predictions differ by up to @xmath58 .",
    "the peculiar property of the @xmath59 state wave function is the node at @xmath60 which causes strong cancellations in the matrix elements eq .   and as a result , a suppression of photoproduction of @xmath6 relative to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the lowest fock component @xmath40 in the infinite momentum frame is not related by simple lorentz boost to the wave function of charmonium in the rest frame .",
    "this makes the problem of building the lc wave function for the lowest @xmath40 component difficult , no unambiguous solution is yet known .",
    "there are only recipes in the literature , a simple one widely used @xcite , is the following .",
    "one applies a fourier transformation from coordinate to momentum space to the known spatial part of the non - relativistic wave function , @xmath61 , which can be written as a function of the effective mass of the @xmath2 , @xmath62 , expressed in terms of lc variables m^2 ( , ) =  . in order to change integration variable @xmath63 to the lc variable @xmath13 one relates them via @xmath64 , namely @xmath65 . in this way the @xmath2 wave function acquires a kinematical factor [ lc - wf - p ] ( ) ( , ) _ ( , )  .",
    "this procedure was used in @xcite and the result is applied to calculation of the amplitudes .",
    "the result was discouraging , since the @xmath6 to @xmath5 ratio of the electroproduction cross sections are far too low in comparison with data .",
    "however , the oversimplified dipole cross section @xmath66 was used , and what is even more essential , the important ingredient of lorentz transformations , the melosh spin rotation , was left out .",
    "the 2-dimensional spinors @xmath67 and @xmath68 describing @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively in the infinite momentum frame are known to be related via the melosh rotation @xcite to the spinors @xmath69 and @xmath70 in the rest frame : @xmath71 and @xmath72 , where the matrix @xmath73 has the form : r ( , ) =  .",
    "[ matrix ]    since the potentials we use contain no spin - orbit term , the @xmath2 pair is in @xmath74-wave . in this case",
    "spatial and spin dependences in the wave function factorize and we arrive at the following lc wave function of the @xmath2 in the infinite momentum frame [ lc - wf ] ^(,| ) _ ( , ) = u^(,| ) ( , ) _ ( , )  , where u^(,| ) ( , ) = _ c^r^ ( , ) e__y r^*(1-,- ) _ y^-1_|c^| .",
    "now we can determine the lc wave function in the mixed longitudinal momentum - transverse coordinate representation : [ lc - wf - r ] ^(,| ) _",

    "it is expected to vanish @xmath75 at small @xmath76 due to color screening @xcite and to level off at large separations .",
    "we use a phenomenological form which interpolates between the two limiting cases of small and large separations .",
    "few parameterizations are available in the literature , we choose two of them which are simple , but quite successful in describing data and denote them by the initials of the authors as `` gbw '' @xcite and `` kst '' @xcite",

    "the proton structure function calculated with this parameterization fits well all available data at small @xmath78 and in wide range of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however , it obviously fails describing the hadronic total cross sections , since it never exceeds the value @xmath79 .",
    "the @xmath78-dependence guarantees bjorken scaling for dis at high @xmath1 , however , bjorken @xmath78 is not a well defined quantity in the soft limit .",
    "instead we use the prescription of @xcite , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the charmonium mass .    this problem with limited dipole cross section as well as the difficulty with the definition of @xmath78",
    "have been fixed in @xcite .",
    "the dipole cross section is treated as a function of the c.m .",
    "energy @xmath82 , rather than @xmath78 , since @xmath82 is more appropriate for hadronic processes .",
    "a similarly simple form for the dipole cross section is used [ kst ]   _ |qq(,s ) & = & _ 0(s )  .",
    "the values and energy dependence of hadronic cross sections are reproduced with the following expressions _ 0(s ) & = & 23.6 ( ) ^0.08 ( 1 + 38 )  , + r_0(s ) & = & 0.88 ( ) ^-0.14  .",
    "the energy dependent radius @xmath83 is fitted to data for the proton structure function @xmath84 , @xmath85 and the mean square of the pion charge radius @xmath86 .",
    "the improvement at large separations leads to a somewhat worse description of the proton structure function at large @xmath1 .",
    "apparently , the cross section dependent on energy , rather than @xmath78 , can not provide bjorken scaling .",
    "indeed , parameterization is successful only up to @xmath87 .",
    "in fact , the cases we are interested in , charmonium production and interaction , are just in between the regions where either of these parameterization is successful .",
    "therefore , we suppose that the difference between predictions using eq .   and is a measure of the theoretical uncertainty which fortunately turns out to be rather small .",
    "having eq .   and the expressions from the previous section ( lc wave functions and dipole cross section ) , we can calculate cross sections for the virtual photoproduction @xmath88 [ sigma - gp ] _",

    "the correction from the real part is not small since the cross section of charmonium electroproduction is a rather steep function of energy .",
    "we present here only results for energy dependence of the @xmath5 integrated cross section ( fig .",

    "one can see that there are no major differences for the results using the gbw and kst parameterizations .",
    "the bt and log potentials describe the data very well , while the potentials cor and pow underestimate them by a factor of two .",
    "the different behavior has been traced to the following origin : bt and log use @xmath55 , but cor and pow @xmath54 . while the bound state wave functions of @xmath5 are little affected by this difference , the photon wave function eq",

    "but they have a much more dramatic impact on @xmath6 increasing the electroproduction cross section by a factor 2 - 3 .",

    "<S> elastic virtual photoproduction of charmonia on nucleons is calculated in a parameter free way with the light - cone dipole formalism and the same input : factorization in impact parameters , light - cone wave functions for the photons and the charmonia , and the universal phenomenological dipole cross section which is fitted to other data . </S>",
    "<S> the charmonium wave functions are calculated with four known realistic potentials , and two models for the dipole cross section are tested . </S>",
    "<S> very good agreement with data for the cross section of charmonium electroproduction is found in a wide range of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . using the ingredients from those calculations we calculate also exclusive electroproduction of charmonia off nuclei . here </S>",
    "<S> new effects become important , ( i ) color filtering of the @xmath2 pair on its trajectory through nuclear matter , ( ii ) dependence on the finite lifetime of the @xmath2 fluctuation ( coherence length ) and ( iii ) gluon shadowing in a nucleus compared to the one in a nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> total coherent and incoherent cross sections for c , cu and pb as functions of @xmath0 are presented . </S>",
    "<S> the results can be tested with future electron - nucleus colliders or in the peripheral collisions of relativistic heavy ions .     </S>",
