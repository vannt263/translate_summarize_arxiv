    "power law distribution commonly exists in complex networks , including planned network such as internet@xcite and unplanned social networks , such as scientific collaboration networks@xcite , actor collaboration networks@xcite , peer - to - peer networks@xcite , mobile networks@xcite and much more .",
    "their degree distributions obey power law , and if applicable , vertex strength(summing the weights of links that connect to a vertex)@xcite and link weight@xcite also follow power law .",
    "many models have been proposed to capture the topological evolution of complex networks ( see reviews @xcite ) .",
    "especially a class of models based on the idea of global preferential attachment , firstly proposed in ba model@xcite , is quite successful to reproduce the power law distributions of degree / strength@xcite . from the degree - based preferential attachment in ba model ,",
    "later barrat@xcite developed a model of weighted networks with strength - based preferential attachment .",
    "some networks have hubs or data centers , where global information is collected for future use .",
    "for example , www has search engines and internet has routers and dns servers . for networks with such centers",
    ", global preferential attachment mechanism may seem reasonable .",
    "however , in social network there is no data centers collecting and providing global information .",
    "it is impossible for every individual to know global information of system , such as degree or strength of every individual . for social networks ,",
    "evolution mechanism based on local quantities would be more natural .    actually , there are already several evolving models for scale - free networks based on local rules , such as distance - dependent preferential attachment(ddpa ) model@xcite , acquaintance network model@xcite , connecting nearest - neighbor(cnn ) model@xcite , random walk model@xcite , redirection model@xcite , optimization model@xcite and so on .",
    "for instance , in ddpa model a measure of closeness relation is defined locally within second neighbors and then links are built up preferentially according to the relation .",
    "acquaintance network model evolves via people introduced to know each other by a common acquaintance@xcite . in cnn model@xcite , at every time step , a new vertex is added or a potential edge within second neighbors is converted into an edge .",
    "all above models based on local rules can also reproduce the common topological characters of complex networks .",
    "we notice that both the two potentially conflicting types of models successfully capture the main characters of scale - free networks , but one needs global information while the other only requires local information . here",
    "we suggest a wild guess to resolve the conflict and make the whole picture more consistent .",
    "we conjecture that global preferential attachment emerges from local contact based models . in this paper",
    ", we are going to investigate whether or not the above conjecture holds in the following local models : ddpa model@xcite , acquaintance networks model@xcite and cnn model@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ method ] , we first briefly describe the method used to check preferential attachment . in section [ model ] , we apply this method to ddpa model , acquaintance networks model and cnn model , and present the results . at last , in section [ conclud ] we give some concluding remarks . and",
    "it turns out our conjecture does hold in the above models .",
    "the preferential attachment hypothesis states that the rate @xmath0 with which a vertex with @xmath1 links acquires new links is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath1@xcite , namely @xmath2 for ba model @xmath3@xcite .",
    "h. jeong et al@xcite proposed a method to check global preferential attachment from data on evolution process . here",
    "we will briefly describe the method . in evolving process",
    ", we record the order of each node and link joining the system within a relatively short time frame after the network evolves steadily in a long time . at a large enough time @xmath4 ,",
    "consider all vertices existing in the system , called @xmath4 vertices .",
    "next select a time @xmath5 ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , add a new vertex at every time step between @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "firstly , count the number @xmath9 of such vertices with exactly @xmath1 degree in @xmath4 vertex .",
    "secondly , record all the vertices in @xmath4 vertex to whom the new links are attached as @xmath10 .",
    "lastly , count the number of vertices with exactly @xmath1 degree in @xmath10 as @xmath11 . at this condition@xmath12 will be independent of @xmath4 and @xmath5 but depend on @xmath1 only@xcite .",
    "a convenient definition of @xmath13 function could be defined as , @xmath14 according to mean field theory and eq.([preferential ] ) , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the number of new links attaching to vertices @xmath10 .",
    "so eq.([limh ] ) can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is used . to avoid the effect of noise",
    ", we also study the cumulative function instead of @xmath0 @xmath19 if there is a global preferential attachment , then @xmath20    in order to prove the validity of formula ( [ limh ] ) , we apply this method on ba model , starting from a fully connected @xmath21 initial network , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . the exponent in eq.([master ] ) should be @xmath25 and the measurement shows that they are approximately @xmath25 ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ measureba ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the formula ( [ limh ] ) is fit to measure the form of @xmath0 .",
    "function determined numerically for ba model based on equation ( [ limh ] ) .",
    "the slope of solid line is @xmath26(corresponding to @xmath3 as @xmath27 ) , and the slope of dash line is @xmath25 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "this indicates that the exponent @xmath29 is almost @xmath25 .",
    "if not mentioned in the following figures , we run the model for @xmath30 times with the same parameters to count @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and then we determine @xmath33(@xmath34 ) according to eq .",
    "( [ limh ] ) and estimate the value of @xmath29 , where the power - law exponents are calculated on intermediate degree ( vertex strength ) .",
    "we used @xmath5 = @xmath35 if not mentioned .",
    "the parameters are @xmath36 and @xmath37 . ]    in measurement , we only focus on the vertices new links are attached onto , so we only consider ending vertices .",
    "furthermore , measurements on external links from the new vertex and internal links among existing vertices , can be done separately when necessary .",
    "in this section , we are going to check the possibility of such global attachment emerging from the following three local contact models .    _ * ddpa model * _ : the evolution of networks starts from a fully connected @xmath21 initial network . at every time step",
    ", one new vertex is added into the network by connecting it randomly to one old vertex .",
    "and then other @xmath38 old vertices are randomly activated .",
    "every one ( denoted as vertex @xmath39 ) of these @xmath40 vertices can attempt to build up @xmath41 connections .",
    "the probability for every link ( except the first link from the new vertex ) from a vertex @xmath39 to a vertex @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 means neighbors of vertex @xmath39 up to the second separation .",
    "@xmath45 is the similarity distance@xcite , which means that the larger is the similarity distance , the closer is the relation between the two end vertices . if two vertices @xmath42 and @xmath46 are connected directly , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the similarity weight , meaning the larger the closer , such as the number of collaboration in scientific collaboration networks@xcite , and the duration of calls in mobile networks@xcite . otherwise , @xmath49 is calculated as follows . if vertex @xmath42 ( @xmath50 ) is connected to vertex @xmath50 ( @xmath46 ) with similarity link weight @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) then @xmath53 .",
    "the final similarity distance between vertex @xmath42 and vertex @xmath46 is @xmath54 , the maximum one via all vertices @xmath55 . in other words , it is sufficient to know the degree of familiarity between second neighbors .",
    "in addition , the reconnection between linked vertices is allowed .",
    "when building up connection between vertices @xmath56 represents an event happening between the vertices , the number of occurrences of such an event may be defined as the connection count @xmath57 , which will be transferred into similarity link weight @xmath58 , e.g. , @xmath59 .",
    "this ddpa mechanism does not use vertex degree or vertex strength , i.e. , @xmath60 , as the reference , not even locally .",
    "it only makes use of the information about local similarity distance within second neighbors , but scale - free phenomenon does appear in ddpa model for intermediate degrees / strengths(see fig.6 in ref.@xcite ) .",

    "but for all other external links , we find that @xmath33 ( measuring according to degree ) and @xmath34 ( measuring according to strength ) for intermediate degrees / strengths follow a straight line on a log - log plot , indicating @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
