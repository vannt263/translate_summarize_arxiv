    "in 1959 , when nanoscience as we know it today was still far from being a reality , richard feynman gave a talk at the annual meeting of the american physical society , entitled `` there s plenty of room at the bottom '' @xcite . in this talk feynman anticipated most of the experimental fields and issues of concern which , more than twenty years later , would become key issues in the understanding of phenomena at the nanometer scale .",
    "while talking about the possibility of building nanoscale electric circuits , he also posed the question : `` ... is it possible , for example , to emit light from a whole set of antennas , like we emit radio waves from an organized set of antennas to beam the radio programs to europe ? the same thing would be to beam the light out in a definite direction with very high intensity ... '' .",
    "today , we can safely state that feynman s suggestion has already become reality and the research on nanoantennas that work at optical frequencies has developed into a strong branch of nanoscience - nano - optics in particular - with many exciting perspectives .",
    "it is the goal of this report to summarize and explain the current understanding of optical antennas on the background of both , the highly developed field of antenna engineering @xcite and plasmonics @xcite .",
    "although feynman s work was right before the eyes of everybody for a long time , it took the solid development of near - field optics @xcite to acquire enough proficiency in using nanostructures to influence the flow of light at deep subwavelength scales with the required precision .",
    "although it is not the intention of this report to provide a detailed account on the chronological development of the field , we nevertheless would like to mention a few selected publications that inspired the authors to enter into the field of nanoantennas .",
    "first of all there is the visionary book chapter by dieter w.  pohl @xcite , in which he points out the similarities between `` fluorescing molecules , small scattering particles etc .",
    "and telecommunication antennas '' and suggests to `` inspect antenna theory for concepts applicable and useful to near - field optics '' .",
    "another eye opener was the paper by grober _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , in which the authors explicitly discuss the use of nanoantennas for scanning near - field optical microscopy and provide proof - of - principle experiments using microwave radiation - an idea later on brought close to realization by oesterschulze _",
    "et al . _",
    "many other efforts dealing with antenna - like structures date back into the eighties and even before , mostly driven by the need for efficient infrared ( ir ) detectors .",
    "a good account is given in recent reviews @xcite .",
    "antennas are used either to create electromagnetic ( e.m . ) waves with a well - defined radiation pattern , which can then travel over large distances , or to receive e.m .",
    "waves from a remote source in order to extract some encoded information , to measure changes in their intensity , or to exploit the transmitted power @xcite .",
    "today the importance of antennas is dominated by their ability to provide an interface between localized information processing using electrical signals and the free - space wireless transmission of information encoded in various parameters of e.m .",
    "waves , such as e.g.  amplitude , phase , and frequency . due to these properties , antennas and e.m .",
    "radiation have become indispensable assets to science and technology as well as to our everyday life .",
    "the function of an antenna is based on the fact that free charge carriers are constricted into certain well - defined regions of space .",
    "these charges may start to oscillate if an ac - voltage is applied or an e.m .",
    "wave is reaching such a region .",
    "examples for such systems are the conduction electrons in pieces of metal @xcite as well as electrons and ions in a gas discharge tube @xcite . an ac - voltage applied to a piece of metal changes the spatial distribution of charges as a function of time , which in turn will eventually affect the electric field of the charge distribution at any distance from the source .",
    "due to the finite speed of light @xmath0 , any change in the charge distribution that occurs at time @xmath1 results in a change in the electric field at a remote point at a distance @xmath2 only after a time @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the refractive index of the medium .",
    "a well - known fundamental source of such e.m .",
    "disturbances is a harmonically oscillating dipole which may be pictured as two metallic spheres connected by a thin wire as it was realized in h.  hertz s pioneering experiments @xcite .",
    "if such a system is prepared in an initial state where some negative charge is on one sphere and the corresponding positive charge on the other one , the system - when left alone - will start to perform an exponentially damped harmonic oscillation at a frequency @xmath5 ( where we assume small damping ) , in which @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the inductance and the capacitance of the system , respectively .",
    "the fact that the system is exponentially damped , i.e.  energy loss is proportional to the energy still stored within the system , has two reasons : ( i ) a finite ( ohmic ) resistance felt by the charge carriers in the metal wire and ( ii ) loss of energy due to radiation of e.m",
    ".  waves .",
    "this so - called radiation loss occurs due to the fact that the oscillation eventually creates time - dependent electric fields at remote distances , which must then be accompanied by magnetic fields that vary according to maxwell s equations . at large enough distance",
    "these fields transform into plane waves which are free - space solutions of the wave equation .",
    "if the dipole oscillation would be suddenly switched off , those far - away fields , or simply far fields , would continue to propagate since they carry energy that is stored in the fields themselves and has been removed from the energy originally stored in the charge distribution we have been starting out with . on the contrary , the so - called near - field zone corresponds to the instantaneous electrostatic fields of the dipole , which do not contribute to radiation but return their energy to the source after each oscillation cycle or when the source is turned off ( reactive power ) .      in order to tune an antenna in such a way that it is resonant at optical frequencies one needs to adjust both @xmath6 and @xmath7 to bring the resonance into the optical regime . as r.  feynman already pointed out in 1959 , in order to achieve a resonance in the optical wavelength regime one would have to make both , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , very small @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved by shrinking the dimensions of the antenna to the scale of the wavelength @xcite . however , if we are moving to higher and higher frequencies in order to eventually end up with ir and visible light , metals no longer behave as perfect conductors .",
    "the main difference between the interaction of low - frequency and very - high - frequency e.m .",
    "waves with the conduction electrons in metals stems from a finite effective mass of electrons .",
    "such effective mass causes the electrons to react with increasing phase lag to the oscillating e.m .",
    "field as the frequency increases .",
    "this behavior is in perfect analogy to a mass on a spring excited by an oscillating external force . in the case of electrons in a metal ,",
    "the restoring force is the coulomb interaction with the stationary metal ions . for low frequencies ,",
    "the electrons follow the excitation without phase lag . for increasing frequency of the excitation , they exhibit an increasing oscillation amplitude as well as an increasing phase lag .",
    "as soon as the phase lag approaches 90@xmath8 the amplitude of the charge oscillation goes through a maximum and is only limited by the internal ( ohmic and radiation ) damping of the system . in metallic nanoparticles , this resonance corresponds to the localized plasmon resonance which for certain materials ( such as gold , silver , aluminum , and copper ) happens to appear in or close to the visible spectral range .",
    "plasmon resonances do not appear in `` perfect '' conductors ( metals at low enough frequencies ) since in those materials by definition no phase lag exists between excitation and charge response .",
    "the presence of localized plasmon resonances is therefore characteristic for optical frequencies and can be exploited to balance drawbacks of antenna systems in this frequency range , such as e.g.  enhanced ohmic losses compared to the radio - frequency ( rf ) regime .",
    "it should be noted here for completeness that the metallic character of doped semiconductors at low frequencies makes it possible to excite surface plasmons resonant at mid infrared , thz , and microwave frequencies @xcite , while even perfect metals if periodically structured can support excitations which behave very similar to surface plasmon polaritons , so - called spoof plasmons @xcite .",
    "why would anybody be interested in antennas at optical frequencies ?",
    "what would be the advantage of using an antenna over standard means , such as lenses and mirrors , to manipulate e.m .",
    "waves at optical frequencies ?",
    "the wavelength of visible light in vacuum in the green spectral range is about 500  nm , corresponding to an energy of about 2.5  ev .",
    "photons with such an energy can interact with matter through transitions between electronic states of spatially confined electrons .    using the simplest quantum mechanical approach to describe such a system , the particle - in - a - box model , it is easy to show that the length scale of electron confinement , i.e.  the length of the box , must be on the order of 1  nm if we require the lowest energy transition to occur in the visible spectral range .",
    "[ fig : confinement - wavelength ] illustrates the quadratic relation between electronic confinement and wavelength of the related e.m .",
    "wave obtained within such a model .",
    "electrons that show such a spatial confinement are typically encountered in larger organic molecules and artificial quantum confined systems , e.g. quantum dots and the like , which we call `` quantum emitters '' for simplicity .",
    "note the strong mismatch between the electronic confinement length , which determines the spectroscopic properties and the local interactions of a quantum emitter on a nanometer scale , and the wavelength of the e.m .",
    "radiation .",
    "since the wavelength governs effects of diffraction , e.g. in the focusing of light , this mismatch prevents propagating photons from being confined to the same spatial extension as the electrons of a quantum emitter .",
    "this leads , for example , to a typical behavior of single molecules at ambient conditions , which is that they absorb only very little light even when illuminated with a tightly focused laser beam @xcite .",
    "similar arguments explain the small cross - section for the generation of excitons in a semiconductor material - the fundamental process for solar energy conversion .",
    "a further important consequence of the length - scale mismatch is a rather long lifetime of the excited state of a typical quantum emitter .",
    "since the size of the molecule is so much smaller than the free - space wavelength of light , the birth of a photon from a quantum emitter is a highly inefficient process @xcite .",
    "this is nicely illustrated considering the total power emitted by a time - harmonic line current element in a homogeneous space with a length @xmath9 much shorter than the wavelength @xmath10 , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the current amplitude and @xmath13 @xmath14 the wave impedance of free space @xcite .",
    "classically , such a current element can be considered a model for the oscillatory motion of electrons in a molecule . obviously , the radiated power is proportional to the square of the length - to - wavelength ratio .",
    "for the typical extension of a molecule of 1  nm this expression well reproduces the experimentally found relatively low excited state decay rates on the order of @xmath15 . due to this - on a molecular timescale - very long excited state lifetime ,",
    "there is plenty of time for the excited - state energy to be dissipated through alternative nonradiative channels or for the molecule to become destroyed by photochemical processes .",
    "furthermore , the maximum number of photons that can be emitted per unit time is relatively small .",
    "it is the low photon emission rate that limits the usability of single quantum emitters as sources of single photons @xcite and their detectability in sensing and spectroscopic applications .",
    "finally , as a third consequence of the mentioned size mismatch , we note that in a typical far - field experiment spatially - resolved spectroscopic analysis of photons emitted simultaneously by an ensemble of closely packed quantum emitters is hindered by diffraction , which limits spatial resolution to about half of the emission wavelength @xcite .",
    "since optical antennas are able to ( i ) confine e.m .",
    "radiation to very small dimensions and ( ii ) very efficiently release radiation from localized sources into the far field , they provide the possibility to tailor the interaction of light with nano - matter in such a way that the three mentioned fundamental shortcomings can be lifted to a large extent .",
    "therefore the idea of an `` optical antenna '' is a fundamental concept in the general field of light-(nano)matter interaction",
    ".    potential applications of optical antennas are therefore closely related to their ability to strongly localize and enhance optical fields upon illumination into the feed point - e.g.  the gap between two antenna arms . both field confinement and enhancement trigger strong interest related to nonlinear optical effects , ultrasensing , imaging , as well as solar energy conversion and opto - electronics , all of which will be discussed in more detail later on in this report .",
    "moreover , and as a further illustration , let us consider the field of optical communication : since the higher the frequency , the more information can be encoded , the visible and infrared wavelength band is widely used in today s high - speed data communication networks . as an interesting side effect ,",
    "when entering the optical regime , the frequency becomes large enough such that detection of single radiation quanta is readily achievable and that quantum jumps in single molecules and atoms can be induced and observed @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the optical regime , quantum aspects of the interaction of radiation and matter can be exploited in the context of long distance communication @xcite . in this",
    "picture photons are considered as `` flying qubits '' , while the atoms and molecules act as immobilized qubits @xcite .",
    "due to the fact that antenna emission patterns can be tuned in such a way that radiation is emitted in specific directions with sharp angular characteristics , the use of single quantum emitters in combination with optical antennas opens up fascinating new perspectives for quantum communication and data processing @xcite .      to provide a solid background",
    ", we will begin with a brief account on the theory of classical rf antennas and introduce important antenna parameters .",
    "in contrast to perfectly conducting antennas , antennas at optical frequencies consist of nanometer - sized metal particles . their interaction with light",
    "is determined by the frequency - dependent complex dielectric function , which we will introduce first .",
    "we then start out to investigate the resonant behavior of single wires which are the basic constituents of optical antennas .",
    "we then move to isolated structures that consist of at least two strongly interacting nanoparticles and then to more complex structures and to optical antennas interacting with a `` driving circuit '' .",
    "while analyzing the resonances of these systems we will pinpoint the similarities and differences in the behavior of optical antennas as compared to their rf counterparts .",
    "what follows is then a brief account on fabrication methods that can be used to create optical antennas as well as an overview of the most important nanoantenna geometries that have been investigated so far .",
    "once optical antennas have been fabricated , it is important to be able to verify the expected performance .",
    "here we provide an account of the currently used optical characterization techniques and their respective strengths .",
    "we conclude our discussion with a brief review of current applications and fields of intense study in the context of nanoantennas .",
    "classical antenna theory uses maxwell s equations to describe the interaction of time - dependent currents with electromagnetic waves .",
    "most characteristic features of classical antennas are related to the two facts that ( i ) antenna wires are represented by a perfect conductor and ( ii ) critical dimensions , such as the antenna feed - gap and wire thickness , can be considered to be negligibly small compared to the wavelength .",
    "we assume time - harmonic fields throughout this report .",
    ".  field emitted by an antenna is completely determined as soon as the time - harmonic current density @xmath16 along the antenna wires is known , from which the charge density @xmath17 then follows according to the continuity relation @xmath18 .",
    "the reason for this is that in the lorenz gauge , @xmath19 , the vector potential @xmath20 and the scalar potential @xmath21 satisfy a set of four inhomogeneous scalar helmholtz equations @xmath22{\\bf a}({\\bf r } ) & = & -\\mu_o\\mu { \\bf j}({\\bf r } ) \\\\ \\left[\\nabla^2 + k^2\\right]\\phi({\\bf r } ) & = & -\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_o\\varepsilon}\\rho({\\bf r } ) \\label{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 , with @xmath10 being the free - space wavelength .",
    "the field distribution , radiation pattern and total power radiated by the antenna are then found e.g.  by calculating a spatial convolution of the respective scalar green s function @xmath24 for the given problem with the current density and the charge density present on the antenna as @xmath25 the scalar green s function is the solution of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) for a dirac delta source distribution @xcite .",
    "once the potentials are known , the fields can be determined by straightforward differentiation according to the definitions @xmath26 it turns out , however , that the current distribution on the antenna is quite difficult to determine exactly . for center - fed antennas with small feed - gaps and thin wires ,",
    "an approximate current distribution can be found by solving an integral equation ( see e.g.  @xcite for details ) . here , for reasons of simplicity , we discuss important antenna parameters under the assumption that the current distribution on a dipole antenna has a sinusoidal shape inherited from the standing wave pattern that builds up in a two - wire transmission line terminated by an open end , driven by a high - frequency voltage source .",
    "this is the kind of circuitry that is often used to drive an antenna .",
    "the configuration is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : transmissionline ] ( a ) .",
    "harmonically driven two - wire transmission line terminated by ( a ) an open end and ( b ) a finite - length antenna . for a given instant of time , the arrows indicate magnitude and direction of the current , plus and minus signs indicate local charge accumulation , and the solid line indicates the standing current wave ; ( c ) equivalent circuit of the system including the internal impedance of the generator , @xmath27 , the characteristic impedance of the transmission line , @xmath28 , as well as the impedance of the antenna , @xmath29 , acting as a load.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the transmission line itself , although it sustains time - harmonic currents with a spatially varying amplitude , does not radiate into the far field if the gap between the wires is small , since each current element in one wire has its antiparallel counterpart in the other wire oscillating @xmath30 out of phase and therefore radiation largely cancels in the far field albeit a strong near field that is localized between the wires . since good conductors are considered in rf circuits , the wavelength of the standing wave is practically the same as the wavelength in free space . for an infinitely - long transmission line",
    "the local ratio of the voltage between the wires and the current through a wire is a constant called _",
    "characteristic impedance _ , @xmath31 , independent of the position @xmath32 along the line .",
    "it depends solely on the materials used and on the geometry of the transmission line @xcite .    in the lowest approximation",
    "one may assume that this sinusoidal current distribution is not significantly changed when we start to bend the wires at a certain distance @xmath33 from the open end - one upwards and one downwards .",
    "the strongest radiation from such a system of total length @xmath34 is obtained for a bending angle of 90@xmath35 [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : transmissionline ] ( b ) ] . it can be shown that for antennas made of thin wires compared to the wavelength the current is indeed very well described by a sinusoidal distribution @xmath36\\textrm{,}\\ ] ] in which the amplitude becomes @xmath37 as expected from the simplistic standing - wave model @xcite .",
    "the actual current amplitude , however , differs from that found in the unbend transmission line .",
    "the reason for this behavior lies in the fact that the antenna itself can now be thought of as a resonant circuit with a total complex impedance @xmath38 , leading in general to a reflection at the bending point and a shift in the standing - wave pattern as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : transmissionline ] ( b ) .",
    "it is then natural to define the input impedance of an antenna by the ratio of the voltage measured over the input terminals and the current flowing into each antenna arm , @xmath39 .",
    "as for any frequency - dependent complex impedance , the equivalent circuit of the antenna shows a resonance for the driving frequency for which @xmath40 , which also leads to a maximum in the current amplitude .",
    "we will refer to such a resonance as an `` antenna resonance '' .",
    "the absorbed power is determined by the real part of the antenna impedance @xmath41 , which includes ohmic losses , @xmath42 , as well as losses due to radiation , @xmath43 , and accordingly @xmath44 once the radiation resistance is known , the radiated power can be calculated as @xmath45 .",
    "a corresponding relation holds for the nonradiative power dissipated into heat .",
    "the _ radiation efficiency _ of an antenna can therefore be defined as @xcite @xmath46 describing the ratio of the radiated power to the total power absorbed by the antenna , in analogy to the quantum yield of a fluorescent molecule @xcite . since ohmic losses for rf antennas",
    "are very small , radiation efficiencies are typically larger than 99% .    together with a simple model for the high - frequency generator driving the antenna via the transmission line , which is described by a lossless ac - voltage source and a complex internal impedance @xmath27 , we can come up with the equivalent circuit model for the whole system depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : transmissionline ] ( c ) .",
    "the equivalent circuit model allows one to describe all relevant parameters of the circuit .",
    "before we get involved with this in more detail we would like to discuss the _ radiation pattern _ @xmath47 of a linear antenna with sinusoidal current distribution ( eq . [ current_eq ] ) , which is described by @xcite @xmath48 where the angle @xmath49 is measured from the direction of the antenna wires and @xmath50 is the azimuthal angle .",
    "as one might expect , the emission pattern for antenna lengths up to @xmath10 is very similar to the pattern of a hertzian dipole ( @xmath51 ) only that its angular dependence becomes narrower . only when the antenna length increases beyond @xmath10 , current elements are introduced on the same wire that oscillate @xmath30 out of phase , causing strong interference effects which lead to the development of a multi - lobed pattern ( see fig .  [ pattern ] ) .",
    "the radiation pattern can be further influenced by deviating from the linear shape of the antenna or by adding additional wires as passive elements at well - chosen positions as it is done in the famous yagi - uda antenna design @xcite to be discussed later on .    ) and for perfectly conducting thin - wire antennas of length @xmath52 , @xmath10 , and @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the gap antenna attached to an impedance - matched waveguide effectively behaves as a single - wire antenna .",
    "a sketch of the current standing wave is provided beside each emission pattern.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in order to quantify and compare the ability of different antennas to radiate power preferentially into a certain direction , antenna engineers introduce _ directivity _",
    "@xcite @xmath54 which is defined as the ratio of the radiation intensity @xmath47 to the total radiated power @xmath55 per unit solid angle ( corresponding to an ideal isotropic radiator )",
    ". an equally important figure of merit is the antenna _ gain _ , which is defined as the ratio of @xmath47 to the total input power @xmath56 that is to be re - radiated per unit solid angle ( corresponding to the power that would be radiated by an antenna with no losses ) .",
    "obviously , gain @xmath57 and directivity @xmath58 are related by the radiation efficiency of the antenna : @xmath59 these and other relevant figures of merit are of course strongly frequency - dependent .",
    "therefore , in antenna design it is important to specify the _ bandwidth _ over which a certain performance is achieved .",
    "so far we have considered antennas mostly as devices which create e.m .",
    "however , naturally , antennas can also be used to collect e.m .",
    "one may ask whether there is a relation between the ability of an antenna to emit e.m .",
    "waves and its ability to collect them .",
    "indeed , such relations exist and are typically discussed by calling upon different forms of reciprocity theorems . we will not give any derivation here , but only state the most important reciprocity relation for antenna - like e.m .",
    "systems and mention the conclusions that can be drawn . assuming time - harmonic fields in linear media in which the tensors @xmath60 and @xmath61 are symmetric , the reciprocity theorem , sometimes referred to as the rayleigh - carson reciprocity theorem , reads as @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 @xmath64 are time - harmonic source currents which may run through antenna wires and @xmath65 @xmath64 are the corresponding fields that originate from the respective currents .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ reciprocity ] ) describes a situation with two independent currents and the resulting fields , i.e.  two antennas .",
    "the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ reciprocity ] ) only run over the volume of the respective source currents because the integrands vanish everywhere else .",
    "( [ reciprocity ] ) can be used to proof ( i ) that the shape of the angular receiving pattern of an antenna equals that of its angular emission pattern @xcite and ( ii ) that the ratio of the power delivered from the first antenna to the second antenna and the power supplied to the first antenna is equal to the ratio of the power delivered from the second to the first antenna and the power supplied to the second antenna @xcite .",
    "these two reciprocity relations for antennas are very useful in antenna engineering and remain valid also at optical frequencies where they are more and more frequently used @xcite .    in the case of an optical antenna that is coupled to a quantum emitter in its vicinity , eq .",
    "( [ reciprocity ] ) can be used to derive a reciprocity relation that links the polarization- and angle - of - incidence - dependent rate for excitation @xmath66 and the radiative decay rate @xmath67 via the polarization - dependent directivity @xmath68 @xcite    @xmath69    where @xmath70 denotes the two polarization directions of the transverse radiated far fields and @xmath71 denotes quantities in absence of the antenna . in the derivation a second dipolar emitter is assumed in the far field of the antenna .",
    "the excitation rate @xmath66 is therefore the rate at which the antenna - coupled emitter is excited by a plane wave with polarization @xmath72 and direction @xmath73 .",
    "note that this reciprocity relation can not make any predictions about the nonradiative decay rate , i.e. ohmic losses that occur in the antenna , since nonradiative antenna modes are near - field effects and therefore are independent of the reciprocity consideration .",
    "the question which antenna performs best for a given application is often not easy to answer since contradicting requirements , e.g.  a strongly directed emission pattern and a large bandwidth or a small overall size and a large radiation resistance , need to be combined .",
    "radiowave antenna engineering strongly benefits from the fact that metals at radio frequencies can be considered to be nearly lossless .",
    "this makes it possible to screen a very large variety of antenna shapes to achieve a certain performance without having to pay much attention to the radiation efficiency .",
    "things start to change as we move towards shorter wavelengths , and already for the microwave regime ( the thz domain ) losses become a constraint that antenna and circuit engineers have to deal with .",
    "the simplest antenna circuit we can think of has already been drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : transmissionline](c ) . in the general case",
    ", the impedance discontinuity at the load will result in reflection of the forward - traveling voltage wave , with a reflection coefficient given by @xcite @xmath74 since impedances in general also possess an imaginary part related to their reactive properties , the reflection coefficient is a complex quantity , describing both the amplitude of the reflected back - traveling signal and its phase relation with the forward wave . from eq .",
    "( [ reflection ] ) , it is clear that reflectionless coupling can be achieved when the characteristic impedance of the transmission line matches the antenna impedance , i.e.  when @xmath75 . in an unmatched situation it is possible that the antenna is on resonance but very little power",
    "is delivered to it via the transmission line because of a large impedance mismatch .",
    "this is a situation that occurs for example for an antenna with @xmath76 in which the current vanishes in the gap according to eq .",
    "[ current_eq ] .",
    "although it has favorable properties , such an antenna can not be fed by connecting wires at the feed - gap since the related antenna impedance diverges leading to a strong impedance mismatch .    in order to be able to efficiently deliver energy to an antenna ,",
    "rf antenna engineers have developed strategies to achieve efficient impedance matching between the generator and the antenna even for exotic antennas .",
    "this is often achieved using external circuits , e.g.  passive stubs , which consist of short pieces of transmission lines connected in series or parallel close to the antenna feed point @xcite .",
    "such matching circuits act as resonators , storing a considerable amount of power , and modify the phase and amplitude of the reflected voltage wave . for perfect conductors ,",
    "only a small amount of power is consumed by such passive matching elements .",
    "therefore the overall radiation efficiency of the antenna including the matching circuit is only slightly smaller than that of the antenna alone .",
    "however , for higher frequencies , this is not true anymore , and standing - wave stub currents need to be properly minimized to keep losses low .",
    "therefore , for antennas at optical frequencies , such strategies can not be copied without careful consideration , since stub - like resonator structures as well as antenna circuits that exhibit a rather large number of passive elements may have rather strong losses and consequently a strongly reduced overall radiation efficiency . moreover , while everything can be intuitively understood in terms of voltage - wave reflection , things can become more subtle when power reflection is considered @xcite .",
    "the question of how to feed an antenna in an optimal way will be of particular importance for nanoantennas at optical frequencies as we will discuss later on .",
    "the constricted electron gas needed to build an antenna is very often provided by metals . however , at optical frequencies metals no longer behave as perfect conductors .",
    "their optical response is described by a complex frequency - dependent dielectric function @xmath77 , relating the electric field @xmath78 and the induced polarization density as @xmath79e(\\omega)$ ] @xcite . in order to qualify for use in optical antennas , ohmic losses in the chosen metal",
    "should be as low as possible .",
    "ohmic absorption is proportional to the material conductivity @xmath80 , which in turn is related to @xmath81 by @xmath82 , and ohmic losses take place in close proximity to the surface within the so - called penetration depth @xcite .",
    "typical penetration depths for metals at visible frequencies are of the order of several tens of nm , e.g. about 13 and 31  nm for aluminum and gold at 620  nm wavelength , respectively @xcite .",
    "material losses in metal nanostructures can be kept low either by choosing a metal with large ( negative ) real part of @xmath81 , in order to reduce the penetration depth , or by selecting a low imaginary part of @xmath81 , in order to intrinsically keep the ohmic losses low .",
    "moreover the dielectric properties of a metal , as we will see , can cause a particle plasmon resonance in the visible spectrum , which is connected to large local fields and enhanced scattering . for small particles in vacuum , on resonance ,",
    "the real part of @xmath81 takes on the value @xmath83 for a wavelength in the blue - green region , so that elongated particles and dimers show a resonance in the red or near - ir region , as will be discussed . since @xmath83 is not very large ,",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath81 can not be neglected when discussing plasmonic resonances .      the optical response in metals",
    "is dominated by the collective behavior of the free electron gas . to a first approximation ,",

    "however , when placed in close proximity to the antenna feed point it would drive a current in the optical antenna by means of its strong near field .",
    "the radiation ( or the ohmic losses for the case of coupling to a bad antenna mode ) due to this current then dominates the overall behavior of the coupled system .",
    "another possibility to drive an optical antenna is to rely on a nanoscopic two - wire transmission line as a feeding structure , as in the rf case discussed in section [ antennalanguage ] , which consists of wires that have roughly the same cross - section as those used in the nanoantenna itself @xcite .",
    "the two - wire transmission line supports a localized , nonradiative mode which oscillates at optical frequencies .",
    "however , as opposed to the radiowave regime , the finite width of the wire and the reduced wavelength of the propagating mode need to be taken into account",
    ". both types of `` driving circuits '' have to deal with the problem that the antenna impedance and impedance matching of the antenna to the driving circuit are difficult to define . on the one hand",
    ", this is because of the obvious experimental difficulty of direct probing nanoscale currents and voltages . on the other hand",
    ", there is the general problem that the rf - inspired lumped - circuit approach @xcite only holds _ strictly _ in the quasistatic limit in which all constituents of the driving circuit are supposed to be much smaller than the respective free - space wavelength , which is not easy to achieve in plasmonics .",
    "when placing a quantum emitter in close proximity to a nanoantenna , due to the modified local density of final states available for the decay of the system compared to the case of homogeneous space , the decay rate @xmath148 of the emitter is also modified .",
    "the description of such effects in principle requires a quantum analysis of the problem in which the so - called partial local density of states needs to be determined .",
    "it can be shown @xcite , however , that the partial local density of final states can be expressed via the imaginary part of green s dyadic of the system evaluated at the position @xmath149 of the emitter , i.e. purely based on electromagnetic theory , @xmath150 with @xmath151\\textrm{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath152 is the partial local density of states @xcite and @xmath153 is the unit vector pointing along the direction of the dipole moment @xmath154 .",

    "the total decay rate @xmath148 of the quantum system coupled to the antenna is the sum of the radiative @xmath159 and the nonradiative decay rate @xmath160 .",
    "when a quantum emitter is coupled to the local fields of an optical antenna , the coupled system has a very large absorption cross section compared to that of the isolated emitter .",
    "qualitatively , this is explained by the high local fields that are created upon external far - field illumination . using the reciprocity theorem",
    "one can argue that an emitter placed in the feed - gap will itself produce a strongly localized field upon excitation , which then efficiently couples to an antenna mode and thus significantly increases both @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "this is the result of a strongly reduced excited - state lifetime , with the benefit of a larger saturation rate for the generation of far - field radiation .",

    "the distance of the emitter from the wire apex is 5  nm in both cases . by calculating the time - averaged flux of the poynting vector through boxes surrounding the antenna arms without including the emitting dipole ,",
    "the ohmic losses in the antenna can be obtained @xcite . a significant increase in the radiated power",
    "can be observed for the case of the two - wire antenna compared to the single - wire antenna .",
    "moreover , by comparing the radiated power with the power dissipated to heat by ohmic losses , and by considering the resulting radiation efficiency , the improved performance achieved by coupling the emitter to the two - wire antenna , with a radiation efficiency improved by almost a factor of 2 compared to the single wire , becomes evident .",
    "finally , in panel  ( d ) we show the effect of changing the position of the emitter by displacing it 10  nm away from the feed - gap center .",
    "while the radiation efficiency is largely unaffected , the overall radiation enhancement gets significantly lower .        therefore",
    ", a single quantum emitter coupled to an optical antenna can have strongly improved emission and absorption properties while retaining its quantum character , e.g.  its single - photon emission ability .",
    "such coupled systems have been investigated experimentally and are often referred to as `` superemitters '' for the just mentioned reasons @xcite .",
    "the term `` superemitter '' should not lead to the wrong assumption that the coupling of a point - like emitter to a nanoantenna can have no adverse effects .",
    "the emission rate of a point dipole coupled to an optical antenna is enhanced when the emitter efficiently couples to the fundamental dipolar antenna mode . as a general trend , it is observed that the coupling increases with decreasing emitter - to - antenna distance .",
    "however , for distances that are sufficiently small , the strong field gradients of the point dipole source can efficiently excite higher multipolar lossy modes of the antenna which are mostly dark or weakly coupled to the radiation field and therefore convert e.m .",
    "energy into heat @xcite . as a result , below a certain optimal distance which depends on geometry , material and wavelength ,",
    "the non - radiative emission rate of the dipole will strongly increase and pull the overall radiation efficiency close to zero .",
    "this effect is also named `` quenching '' .",
    "we now assume an emitter at a distance to the antenna which is larger or equal than the optimum distance . in this case",
    "the emitter mainly couples to the dipolar mode of the nanoantenna .",
    "for the two fundamental orientations of the emitter , its radiative rate enhancement shows a nontrivial wavelength dependence around the antenna resonance , which depends on the relative phase of the antenna near fields and the orientation of the dipole with respect to the antenna .",
    "since a resonance is involved , a 180@xmath8 phase shift occurs when the resonance is crossed . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ quenching ] , depending on the source dipole orientation , the latter will oscillate in phase with the induced dipole either only above or only below the antenna resonance frequency @xcite .",
    "while in - phase oscillation leads to emission enhancement , anti - phase oscillation leads to a reduced emission .",
    "such effects have been first predicted @xcite and then experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "they are also visible in the simulation results of fig .",
    "[ emission ] , where the radiation efficiency clearly decreases for photon wavelengths shorter than the resonance wavelength .          within quasistatic limit , the concept of lumped circuit elements is a well - established method to simplify the analysis of complex electrical circuits .",
    "the concept of impedance is then introduced to describe the properties of each element and the interactions between different lumped elements in such a circuit .",
    "the extension of these concepts to the optical realm would allow one to describe the response of a nanoparticle , for which the quasistatic approximation reasonably holds , to visible light in terms of an `` optical impedance '' .",
    "such an impedance in perspective would allow for the engineering of complex optical circuits by providing a rationale for the interconnection between nanoelements .",
    "n.  engheta and coworkers @xcite have proposed a model to calculate the impedance of a spherical nanoparticle in the quasistatic limit , and demonstrated that its plasmonic resonance can effectively be described as that of an equivalent rlc circuit constituted of two parallel impedances @xmath161 representing the ratio between the average potential difference and the displacement currents inside the sphere and in the surrounding vacuum , respectively .",
    "in particular , a plasmonic sphere ( @xmath162<0 $ ] ) can be described by the parallel connection of an inductor and a resistor , while a non - plasmonic sphere ( @xmath162>0 $ ] ) is equivalent to the parallel connection of a capacitor and a resistor , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : engheta ] .",
    "the surrounding vacuum behaves like a further capacitor connected in parallel .",
    "although the concept has been pushed forward over the years @xcite , it is not yet widely applied in the practical design of optical antennas and plasmonic circuits .",
    "the challenge for the practical application of the concept lies in the assumptions under which it is developed .",
    "first of all , the lumped circuit theory requires that the mutual influence of particles on each other s local fields can be neglected .",
    "since this is not generally the case for near - field coupling between nano - objects , a dependent current source should be added to the equivalent circuit of each element @xcite , which potentially constitutes an obstacle towards a straightforward application of these concepts .",
    "moreover , the quasistatic approximation is at the basis of the applicability of kirchhoff s voltage law , which locally requires @xmath163 .",
    "when the object size is increased and becomes comparable with the operating wavelength this might not be valid anymore .",
    "although antennas are clearly not sub - wavelength elements , their feed points are usually very close to each other , and in the specific region of the feed - gap - where the quasistatic - like fields closely resemble those of a parallel plate capacitor - the condition @xmath163 is fulfilled , thus justifying the introduction of an input impedance which relates the voltage and the currents at the feed points . for a linear dipole antenna , one can therefore calculate an input impedance by taking the voltage to ( displacement ) current ratio across the feed - gap . in this way",
    ", numeric calculations provide impedance values which overall compare well with those of standard rf antennas @xcite .",
    "moreover , the extension of standard radiowave concepts to optical antennas allows predicting the effect of filling the antenna gap with an arbitrary material , thus loading the antenna with an extra impedance in order to tune the overall input impedance ( e.g. for impedance matching to a transmission line ) @xcite .",
    "while such a treatment nicely illustrates the fact that nanoantennas can be described by equivalent resonant circuits as much as in the rf realm , one always needs to keep in mind that an impedance determined in this way might have limited meaning in terms of experimentally relevant impedances , since the waveguide wires that will be attached to the antenna will generally possess a finite width which makes the concept of feed points critical and might require particular care in its application .",
    "the calculation of the antenna impedance by straight application of its definition relies on the full knowledge of field distributions .",
    "since analytical approaches usually fail to accurately describe the antenna system , calculations based on numeric simulations are widely implemented . as an alternative and possibly more practical approach to determine a nano - optical impedance , one can rely on the relation between impedance mismatch and reflection coefficient when a transmission line is used to feed the antenna @xcite .",
    "the complex reflection coefficient @xmath164 [ see eq .",
    "( [ reflection ] ) ] allows one to extract the antenna impedance once the characteristic impedance of the transmission line is known .",
    "experimentally , @xmath164 can be obtained by imaging the field distribution along the transmission line by means of near - field @xcite or photoemission electron microscopy @xcite techniques .",
    "once the characteristic impedance of the line is calculated , this approach allows one to measure the impedance of any optical circuit element connected to the line as a load .    as an illustration of such concepts , fig .",
    "[ fig : nanolett ] shows simulation results for a prototypical gold antenna circuit constituted by a receiving and an emitting two - wire nanoantenna connected by a two - wire transmission line @xcite , as depicted in panel ( a ) . by illuminating the receiving antenna ,",
    "a propagating mode along the transmission line can be launched , which eventually undergoes an impedance mismatch at the emitting antenna and builds up a standing - wave pattern [ fig .",
    "[ fig : nanolett ] ( b ) ] that can be fitted in order to extract the value of the reflection coefficient as a function of the antenna length [ fig .",
    "[ fig : nanolett ] ( c ) ] .",
    "finally , from @xmath164 one can calculate the antenna impedance by applying eq .",
    "( [ reflection ] ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that the impedance plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : nanolett](d ) , while providing values that compare well with their rf counterparts , tends towards negative antenna reactances .",
    "this is a clear indication that parasitic reactances are present in the antenna equivalent circuit , due to the combined capacitive contribution of the substrate and the antenna gap .",
    "notably , a novel and generalized concept of optical impedance ( termed `` specific impedance '' ) has recently been proposed @xcite , which is able to elegantly provide a unified treatment of the interaction of single emitters with nano- and microstructures such as optical antennas and dielectric cavities in terms of generalized impedance matching concepts . by the formal analogy between the power radiated by a current element in a piece of a conductor and that of an optical dipole",
    ", the specific impedance can be introduced via the imaginary part of green s tensor .",
    "this generalized definition of impedance , which has the dimension of @xmath165 , has been applied to dipole emission in vacuum , in a microcavity , and in the vicinity of a spherical nanoparticle antenna , demonstrating that the green tensor point of view is indeed capable of reconciling concepts from largely separated fields of research .",
    "what we have learned in the previous sections is that optical antenna engineers in many cases will have to deal with isolated antennas that may be coupled to ( or fed by ) single emitters in their vicinity .",
    "the resonances of isolated antennas are well understood .",
    "there are generally applicable rules that can be used to qualitatively predict the resonances of moderately complex assemblies of nanoparticles which are based on effective wavelength concepts and resonance splittings due to strong coupling ( plasmon hybridization )",
    ". for sharp corners and in nanogaps strong near fields may appear for eigenmodes that create opposing surface charge densities at both sides of the gap accompanied by strong electromagnetic coupling .",
    "optimization of the coupling between a localized emitter and a nanoantenna is a field of intense research which has no counterpart in rf antenna design .",
    "however , although significant steps have been made @xcite it is still an open problem how to optimize the transfer of energy between a single emitter and a nanoantenna , which represents its most important and practically relevant feeding mechanism .",
    "even if a perfect impedance match could be achieved , this still would only optimize the energy transferred to the antenna while its radiation efficiency may still be small . conditions for minimal ohmic losses and therefore optimal radiation efficiency might lead to different sets of optimal antenna parameters .",
    "for example , when complex optical antennas are build , each additional passive element lowers the overall radiation efficiency of the antenna , even though it might strongly improve certain properties .",
    "it is therefore advantageous for optical antenna engineers to look for antenna designs that realize a certain function in the simplest possible way .    when integrating nanoantennas into complex plasmonic circuits the different behavior of rf and optical antennas should also be carefully taken into account .",
    "while , as extensively discussed , many efforts are made to apply lumped - circuit approaches and impedance - matching arguments to the optical realm , these concepts at optical frequencies still need to be interpreted and validated against experiments .",
    "so far , we emphasized both the close similarities of optical antennas and standard rf antennas as well as differences that arise in the optical realm because of the non - ideal conductive properties of metals and the occurrence of plasmonic resonances .",
    "it can be fairly said that all the significant differences between the behavior of radiowave and optical antennas stem from the fact that : ( i ) optical antennas are characterized by large ohmic losses and a finite skin depth and ( ii ) the wavelengths of plasmonic wire modes and of free space waves are largely mismatched .",
    "these observations hold many consequences for the behavior of isolated optical antennas as compared to the rf regime , among which the most important can be summarized as follows : ( i ) reduced radiation efficiency , ( ii ) lower quality factors of the resonances ( larger bandwidth ) , ( iii ) a peculiar scaling law for the antenna resonance length , ( iv ) deviating radiation patterns , and finally ( v ) a deviating current distribution .",
    "let us now consider in a bit more detail the question of what are the characteristic properties of an optical antenna as it has been discussed so far .",
    "since any interaction of light with matter leads to the formation of localized near fields @xcite one may ask the question what is the significance of the particular metal nanostructures we have introduced . indeed the term `` optical antenna '' is used in very broad sense in the literature . when categorized according to materials involved , besides metal antennas there are also `` antennas '' made of semiconducting @xcite and dielectric materials @xcite .    in the following we will formulate some criteria to define a subset of nanostructures from all possible shapes of matter that we call `` optical antenna '' for the purpose of this report .",
    "we would like to emphasize that we do not intend to provide a universal definition of `` optical antennas '' , although , the very unspecific use of the term in the literature can cause some confusion .",
    "for the remainder of this report we will stick to these criteria in order to focus and limit our discussion .",
    "the first criterion for a structure to qualify as an optical antenna in the sense of this report is that it should be able to concentrate ( i.e. enhance and localize ) propagating fields of plane waves within a certain spectral bandwidth for a range of directions of incidence , thereby creating enhanced and localized and therefore non - propagating near fields in absence of inelastic processes .",
    "plane waves may be considered here without loss of generality since any propagating field can be decomposed into plane waves propagating in different directions @xcite .",
    "this first criterion does not yet exclude any specific structure according to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the second criterion is that the reciprocity theorem should be applicable to the involved fields and currents ( see section [ reciprocitytheorem ] ) .",
    "the validity of the reciprocity theorem automatically implies also the reverse way of operation of an antenna : the structure can convert - again within a certain bandwidth - local fields into a superposition of plane waves with an emission pattern that equals the receiving pattern .",
    "here it is reasonable to require that the amplitude of at least some of the plane waves emitted in a range of directions must be larger in presence of the nanoantenna than without it .",
    "this second criterion together with the first one excludes structures from the following discussion that show stokes - shifted fluorescence , as well as optical processes in photosynthetic and other supramolecular complexes , where irreversible energy funneling towards a reaction center occurs .",
    "a third criterion is that the light confinement principle does not only rely on free - space propagating waves .",
    "if some part of a structure under consideration is based on such a description this part will not be considered a part of the actual antenna but rather a part of the illumination / detection optics .",
    "obviously this excludes mirrors and lenses of all kinds including fresnel lenses in 3d and in 2d ( plasmonic ) realizations .",
    "furthermore , to increase the field enhancement it is usually favorable if a plasmon resonance is involved which enlarges the absorption cross - section of the optical antenna beyond its projected geometrical area and increases the local intensity enhancement beyond a pure lightening rod effect .",
    "while based on rf antenna theory a resonance would be considered as an effect that limits the bandwidth @xcite , at optical frequencies the involved plasmon resonances are typically very broad and the quality factor is rather small .",
    "therefore bandwidth limitations due to a plasmonic resonance are usually not severe .",
    "finally , we note that the use of an optical antenna according to the criteria above may not always be the best solution for every experimental setting .",
    "there may be situations in which certain parameters of a system are improved while others get worse when trying to optimize an optical antenna .    as a conclusion of these considerations ,",
    "we limit the types of optical antennas that are discussed in the following to finite metal nanostructures that exhibit plasmon resonances in the visible to near - ir range . we will therefore not consider semi - infinite structures here , such as sharp tips , although they play an important role in tip - enhanced spectroscopies @xcite .",
    "since the resonances of optical antennas strongly depend on the exact geometry and dimensions , fabrication of nanoantennas requires reliable and reproducible structuring techniques with a typical resolution below 10  nm in order to accurately define critical dimensions , such as feed - gap size or antenna arm length .",
    "this pushes state - of - the - art nanostructuring techniques to their limit and can be considered one of the main challenges in the realization of optical antennas and plasmonic devices .",
    "various top - down and bottom - up nanofabrication approaches have been applied to experimentally realize optical antennas .",
    "top - down approaches , e.g.  electron - beam lithography ( ebl ) and focused - ion beam ( fib ) milling , typically start from a thin multi - crystalline metal film on top of an optically transparent but electrically conductive substrate ( often indium tin oxide , ito ) , which is needed to avoid charging effects . in general , top - down approaches are capable of fabricating large arrays of nearly identical nanostructures with well defined orientations and distances .",
    "bottom - up approaches , on the other hand , take advantage of chemical synthesis and self - assembly of metal nanoparticles in solution with nearly perfect symmetry and crystallinity that can be put on any substrate .",
    "however , to be effective , bottom - up fabrication techniques often require precise size selection and nanopositioning as well as assembly strategies to create non - trivial structures .",
    "there are ongoing efforts to improve the resolution and reliability of nanostructuring and to better understand the role of crystallinity in the achievement of improved optical responses for plasmonic structures .",
    "rough surfaces and multi - crystalline materials can be detrimental both in terms of increased scattering of plasmons and ill - defined geometric parameters that arise due to the anisotropic response of multi - crystalline materials during nanofabrication . recently , a combination of both approaches has shown potential to fabricate high - definition nanostructures with fine details over large areas @xcite .",
    "one of the most popular techniques to fabricate nanoantennas on a flat substrate is ebl @xcite . in the typical implementation of ebl ( see fig .",
    "[ semfib ] ) a high - resolution electron - sensitive resist , e.g. pmma , is patterned by means of a focused electron beam @xcite .",
    "the patterns are then developed and selectively removed .",
    "a thin layer of metal with the desired thickness is then evaporated covering both the voids and the remaining resist .",
    "finally , the sample is subjected to a solvent which removes the remaining resist and leaves the metal structures in the voids unaffected ( lift - off ) . since the patterning is done by an electron beam ,",
    "the spatial resolution of the pattern is usually below 5  nm .",
    "however , due to the multicrystallinity of the deposited metal layer , the final structural resolution is usually not as good .",
    "a state - of - the - art nanoantenna produced by ebl is shown in fig .",

    "is often used as adhesion layer .",

    "other ebl - based techinques without adhesion layer have been proposed and developed @xcite .",
    "in addition to lithography , electron - beam induced deposition has been applied to build complex nanostructures @xcite or to produce masks for further dry etching @xcite .",

    "another efficient machining technique for the realization of optical antennas is fib milling .",
    "fib structuring is based on the localized sputtering of material using accelerated ga ions extracted from a liquid metal ion source @xcite .",
    "the emitted ions are accelerated , focused into a beam with a few nanometer spot , and scanned over a conductive substrate to produce a desired pattern @xcite .",

    "fib nanofabrication has been successfully applied in a number of cases , because it couples nanoscale resolution with the high versatility of the direct patterning approach @xcite .",
    "the main advantages of fib milling are the broad applicability to almost any type of ( sufficiently conductive ) material and the very good resolution , allowing for the fabrication of prototype surface nanostructures and gaps in the 10 - 20  nm range . when applied to chemically grown single - crystalline metal flakes @xcite , highly reproducible antenna gaps below 10  nm can be obtained",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fabric](b ) ] .",
    "fib is a unique structuring tool whenever the use of resist - based lithographies is difficult , for example with non - flat sample topographies such as optical antennas on atomic - force microscopy ( afm ) tips @xcite or when a resist must be avoided to allow for epitaxial growth of single - crystal metal substrates . on the other hand ,",
    "since fib is a sputtering process , part of the sputtered material can be redeposited back to the surface and contaminate already fabricated structures .",
    "therefore , careful design of the fib pattern and the writing sequence is important .",
    "furthermore , gaps cut by fib usually show a tapered shape so that the gap width is not uniform across the section , an effect which might be less pronounced for ebl because of the absence of direct patterning and which can anyway be kept under control with careful procedure optimization .",
    "although fib sputters away the material , the accelerated ion beam can cause ga ion implantation into the target metal film and substrate .",
    "recently , an energy dispersive x - ray study on a fib structured gold edge @xcite has shown undetectable ga implantation , which corresponds to a ga concentration of @xmath167 . however , since even a weak ion implantation might influence the dielectric properties of the materials , the effects involved need further study .",
    "as an example , the influence of ga residues in the fib - cut nanogaps of au plasmonic antennas on the energy and quality factor of their resonances has clearly been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "a possible low - cost , high - throughput alternative to both fib and ebl patterning is nano - imprint lithography ( nil ) .",
    "as opposed to serial beam - based lithographies , where photons , electrons , or ions are used to define nanopatterns , the nil process utilizes a hard mold that contains all the surface topographic features to be transferred onto the sample and is pressed under controlled temperature and pressure into a thin polymer film , thus creating a thickness contrast @xcite .",
    "resolutions on the order of 10  nm have been demonstrated more than a decade ago .",
    "a promising variation of this technique is uv - nil , where a transparent mold , such as glass or quartz , is pressed at room temperature into a liquid precursor which is then cured by uv radiation . in order to reduce the cost of mold fabrication and to achieve patterning over larger areas at lower pressures , soft nano - imprinting techniques , based on polymeric flexible stamps replicated from a single master mold , have also been developed . in future ,",
    "nil might become the ideal technique for low - cost , highly - reproducible realization of antenna arrays covering large areas , e.g.  for the realization of bio - optical sensors on substrates or on fiber facets @xcite .",

    "use of chemically grown nanoparticles as nanoantennas typically requires to arrange them on a surface in well defined patterns in order to achieve the desired optical properties .",
    "such a controlled assembly can be achieved for example by nanomanipulation @xcite , electrophoresis @xcite , fluidic alignment @xcite , or micro - contact printing @xcite .",
    "recently , polymer spacer layers have also been introduced to control the interparticle distances in nanoparticle clusters @xcite .",
    "the fabrication of very small gaps in optical antennas is an important issue since it will allow studying effects that are expected to act against purely electromagnetic field enhancement effects , such as nonlocality @xcite and quantum tunneling @xcite .",
    "gaps required to reach the regime where such effects may occur are very small , on the order of 1  nm or less @xcite , and are difficult to achieve by standard nanofabrication .",
    "such gaps can , however , be readily achieved by means of chemical self - assembly of gold nanorods in solution [ see fig .",
    "[ fabric](c ) ] , where the gap is determined by the thickness of the surfactant layer that covers the particle surfaces @xcite .",
    "another approach that can produce very small gaps is afm nanomanipulation .",
    "nanostructures can be manipulated on a surface by pushing them in a controlled way using the tip of an afm . to perform the manipulation ,",
    "the structures of interest are first localized using tapping - mode imaging .",
    "then the set point of the feedback loop is increased to the manipulation threshold and pushing is performed by parking the tip `` behind '' a particle and performing a piezo movement in a desired direction . in this way , the gap of a bow - tie antenna has been reduced until contact occurred @xcite . in other experiments ,",
    "nanoantennas containing diamond nanoparticles were assembled by afm nanomanipulation @xcite .      by exploiting the possibilities afforded by scanning probe technology , optical antennas fabricated at the apex of scanning probe tips can be positioned freely to probe different parts of a surface with nanometer precision . in this way it is possible to place a single emitter in close proximity to the antenna feed - gap while probing its optical response with an inverted confocal microscope .",
    "the fabrication of optical antennas at the apex of a scanning probe tip , however , poses a challenge to any microfabrication tool and fib milling is frequently used in this context . as an application example , emission enhancement and a related decrease in excited - state lifetime have been demonstrated for a bow - tie antenna on an afm tip which was coupled to a semiconductor nanocrystal @xcite . in order to obtain a reliable procedure for producing tip - based antennas that are parallel to the sample plane , flat plateaux at the tip apex are desirable as a starting point before metal evaporation and nanostructuring @xcite .",
    "however , antennas can also be realized perpendicular to the sample plane , following the already - established line of tip - on - aperture microscopy @xcite .",
    "the realization of @xmath168 monopole antennas at the apex of tapered optical fibers by fib @xcite and their interaction with single molecules @xcite have thus been investigated .    an alternative approach to the fabrication of antenna probes consists in the chemical grafting of individual gold nanoparticles by means of a dielectric probe tip for which efficient techniques have been developed @xcite .",
    "these concepts have been applied to study the emission properties of molecules coupled to single resonant au nanoparticles attached to tapered optical fibers @xcite .",
    "the technique has also been applied to image the distribution of fluorescently labeled proteins in biological membranes with very high resolution @xcite .",
    "as grafting of nonspherical particles is not trivial , an alternative approach suggests to place nanorods inside quartz nanopipettes @xcite .      the role played by the material quality in determining the quality factor and",
    "the resonance frequency of antenna oscillations , for a given geometry , is twofold : it can affect the scattering of individual electrons involved in the oscillation or it can increase scattering of plasmons into propagating waves .",
    "grain boundaries , voids , or surface contamination can result in changes of both the real and the imaginary part of the dielectric constant , thus modifying the conditions for plasmon propagation and antenna resonances @xcite .",
    "it has been shown for the case of au that changes in the above - bandgap dielectric properties can mainly be attributed to voids in multi - crystalline films , because of the fact that less polarizable material is available , while changes in the below - bandgap dielectric response can be strongly influenced by grain boundaries .",

    "so far we have tried to convey a general understanding of optical antennas including possibilities to fabricate them .",
    "now we are going to introduce nanoantennas that have been proposed and investigated experimentally .",
    "we will start from very simple single - particle structures , like nanospheres and nanorods , then move to more complicated ones , like nanoparticle dimers , cross nanoantennas , and yagi - uda nanoantennas .",
    "for each structure we will discuss how the respective antenna properties benefit their experimental application .",
    "single gold nanospheres and nanorods exhibit a resonance spectrum that shifts with the particle s aspect ratio , as discussed before .",
    "their use is motivated mainly by the easy and well - established chemical synthesis methods that allow producing single - crystalline nanoparticles in solution .",

    "elongated particles as opposed to spheres also show sensitivity to the polarization of the fields .",
    "typically , the field enhancement and confinement near the ends of nanorods is much larger than for a sphere , which can be attributed to the combined contribution of both a more favorable spectral location ( in terms of associated losses ) of the fundamental resonance and of enhanced lightning - rod effects .",
    "coupling of two nanoparticles results in increased near - field intensity enhancement and confinement in the gap , as discussed in sections [ section : coupling ] and [ somesimulations ] .",
    "it also goes along with a further degree of freedom in tuning the resonance frequency and a larger radiation efficiency , as shown by simulations in section [ nanoantenna+quantumemitter ] .",
    "while the nanorod dimers @xcite represent the simplest analogue to rf linear dipole gap antennas , the nanosphere dimers are proposed as the analogue of rf hertzian dipole antennas .",

    "bow - tie dimer antennas are constituted of two triangles facing each other tip - to - tip @xcite .",
    "they are being applied to enhance molecular fluorescence @xcite , raman scattering @xcite , and for high - harmonic generation @xcite .",
    "bow - tie antennas are expected to possess a rather broad bandwidth since they represent the two - dimensional analogue of a biconical antenna @xcite and are also considered to have higher field enhancement in the gap compared to two - wire antennas because of larger lightning - rod effect at the apex .",
    "however , taking fabrication constraints into account , it turns out that the latter effect is practically limited by the radius of curvature at the apex . because of this , if a two - wire and a bow - tie antenna with the same total length ( 300  nm ) , gap ( 30  nm ) , and radius of curvature ( 10  nm )",
    "are compared , the largest resonant field enhancement is obtained for the two - wire antenna , since for the bow - tie structure losses are increased due to the larger volume , which decreases the quality factor ( see fig .",

    "their unidirectional response is appealing in terms of enhanced sensitivity for detection , possible use for improved single - photon sources , and concurrently modified excitation patterns . similarly to their rf counterparts , nanometer - sized yagi - uda antennas consist of a resonant single - wire antenna ( @xmath169 phase shift between the driving field and the induced charge oscillations ) arranged between a reflector ( phase shift @xmath170 ) and a set of directors ( phase shift @xmath171 ) . to this purpose",

    "are highly polarized along the antenna axis @xcite , linear nanoantennas enhance only such field component and thus can be used to control the polarization of the emission from single emitters @xcite . however , for some applications such as polarimetry , chiral molecule mapping or optical data storage and retrieval it is necessary to enhance the field without perturbing its polarization state . to this purpose , cross nanoantennas , consisting of two identical but perpendicular linear dipole antennas sharing a common gap [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : cross](a ) for a representative sem image ] , have been proposed @xcite .",
    "each linear antenna picks up and enhances the field component along its own axis .",
    "the two perpendicular field components then coherently add up in the gap region and build up a localized field with the same polarization properties as the excitation source .",
    "upon circularly polarized excitation , a highly confined spot with an almost unitary degree of circular polarization in the plane of the antenna can thus be obtained [ fig .",

    "for example , a nanosized quarter waveplate has been proposed , by which a confined and enhanced circularly - polarized light field can be produced inside the common gap starting from a linearly - polarized excitation @xcite .",
    "along the same line , asymmetric bow - tie cross antennas have also been introduced as `` nano - colorsorters '' , which are able to control field localization by achieving spectrally distinct resonances on spatially separate hot spots , within distances of only a few tens of nm @xcite .",
    "based on the application of babinet s principle at optical frequencies @xcite and on the phenomenon of extraordinary transmission @xcite , resonant hole antennas have also been proposed as the optical counterparts of standard rf slot antennas , in order to achieve large field confinement on subwavelength regions @xcite . to this purpose , bow - tie @xcite , c - shaped @xcite , and crescent - shaped @xcite hole antennas have been proposed .",
    "also , hole arrays with specific symmetry properties have been demonstrated in order to control their spectral response and radiation directionality @xcite .",

    "in addition to nanoantennas for electric fields , antennas for magnetic field detection have also been realized by fabricating a split ring at the facet of a coated fiber @xcite . for this antenna probe ,",
    "the magnetic field generates a circulating current in the ring - a magnetic dipole - which then couples to a fiber mode thanks to the antenna gap which breaks the cylindrical symmetry of the system .",

    "very recently , planar stacked geometries have also been proposed for optical antennas , where the planar feed - gap is constituted by the separation layer between two stacked antenna arms @xcite .",
    "such a geometry holds promises because of its easier integration in planar device geometries and precise control of the gap width .",
    "as the reader may have noticed , it seems that the designs for optical antennas that have been used so far were strongly inspired by the large pool of antenna structures that have been developed by rf antenna engineers over the years . while this has indeed proven to serve its purpose for a while , it is expected that with improved understanding of the clear differences between optical and rf antennas as pointed out in section [ definition ] , and of the particular ways of using them as discussed in section [ antenna+circuits ] , soon new designs for optical antennas are going to be developed that have no direct rf counterpart but represent optimized realizations for the very high frequencies of visible and near - infrared light .",
    "it is important to note that , in view of practical applications , nanoantennas will generally be supported by a substrate .",
    "it is well - known from rf antenna theory that , when an antenna is positioned over `` ground '' , its impedance is modified by the presence of the image dipole which is generated by the interface nearby .",
    "similar arguments are true for optical antennas , where the substrate refractive index acts as a parasitic impedance and causes a red shift of the resonance frequency , as is well - established for plasmonic nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "for the special case of a linear antenna on and perpendicular to a conducting substrate at optical frequencies , the image dipole is ideally as strong as the antenna dipole , resulting in a resonance length which is only half the free - space length for a given working frequency .",
    "the optical counterpart of such a configuration has been demonstrated by realizing a tip placed on the metalized facet of an optical fiber used for near - field imaging @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the larger refractive index of the substrate compared to air strongly influences the emission pattern of the nanoantenna @xcite , an occurrence that is also well - known for rf antennas @xcite and for quantum emitters on a substrate @xcite .",
    "once antenna structures have been successfully fabricated , their performance needs to be characterized .",
    "this entails analysis of their geometry , position with respect to other structures , near - field intensity distributions , emission pattern , as well as their spectral properties .",
    "while sem , tem , or afm are typically used for the first two purposes , optical and spectroscopic characterization can be achieved by various techniques . as to be expected from the hybrid photonic and electronic character of plasmonic resonances , these techniques are based on interactions with photons , electrons , or combinations of both .",
    "characterization techniques involving electrons have been covered in a number of publications and reviews @xcite .",
    "such methods can provide detailed insight due to their potentially high spatial resolution but experiments require vacuum environments . here",
    "we concentrate on purely optical ( photon - in / photon - out ) techniques because they are straightforward to implement in any optics laboratory",
    ".    optical characterization of nanoantennas requires a combination of spatial resolution ( possibly subwavelength , to resolve nanoscale features ) and spectral resolution ( to properly characterize antenna resonances ) .",
    "photons can interact with an optical antenna either elastically or inelastically .",
    "broadband elastic light scattering is the most natural way to spectrally probe antenna resonances but care needs to be taken in order to sufficiently suppress excitation light .",
    "very high sensitivity can be reached for inelastic interactions , since the measured signals are spectrally separated from the excitation wavelengths .",
    "inelastic interactions , e.g. photoluminescence , typically also bear signatures of the antenna response since the spectrum of the emitted photons may be strongly shaped by the antenna resonances",
    ". the overall efficiency of multiphoton - excited photoluminescence processes , as well as other nonlinear effects , can be used as a probe for the near - field intensity enhancement for a certain antenna mode , since the amplitude of such signals strongly depends on the local excitation intensity .    in this section",
    "we concentrate on techniques that are able to address the optical response of _ individual _ nanostructures .",
    "although extended arrays of nanostructures can in principle be fabricated to provide larger signals during experiments , single - antenna measurements are important to circumvent inhomogeneous broadening of spectral features which may occur due to various structural inhomogeneities .",
    "single - antenna experiments require sufficient detection sensitivity since the scattering cross section for off - resonant structures can become small .",
    "there are two further requirements which need to be considered : ( i ) the response of a resonator to an applied external field is fully characterized only once both its amplitude and phase are known . to capture both quantities , interferometric techniques need to be applied .",
    "furthermore , ( ii ) control over light polarization is required to selectively probe distinct antenna modes .",
    "interaction of light with optical antennas can be either elastic or inelastic .",
    "elastic interaction is encountered when photons of a certain energy excite a certain antenna mode which then re - radiates photons of the same energy ( elastic scattering ) .",
    "inelastic interactions lead to the emission of photons of higher or lower energy .",
    "the respective increase or loss in energy is due to nonlinear and/or dissipative effects , respectively .",
    "one - photon photoluminescence ( 1ppl ) from noble metals is an example for a dissipative effect .",
    "it was first reported in 1969 after 488  nm wavelength excitation of au and cu @xcite .",
    "two - photon photoluminescence ( 2ppl ) is an example of a nonlinear effect .",
    "2ppl in au relies on two sequential single - photon absorption events : a first near - ir photon excites an intra - band transition within the @xmath172 conduction band , while the second photon drives an inter - band transition between the @xmath108 and the @xmath172 bands @xcite .",
    "the resulting hole distribution in the @xmath108 band can eventually decay radiatively , by recombination with @xmath172 electrons , thus leading to a weak photon emission in the green - red spectral region .",
    "recently , 2ppl from ag and al nanorods has also been reported @xcite , rendering the method more universal .",
    "besides two - photon absorption , higher - order multiphoton absorption processes can also lead to photoluminescence in au nanoparticles .",
    "three - photon absorption is sometimes observed @xcite , while a broad emission spectrum depending on the fourth power of the excitation intensity has been reported for dipole antennas @xcite .",
    "even higher - order avalanche multiphoton photoluminescence ( up to 18th order ) has been reported in nanowire arrays @xcite . however , the origin of the photoluminescence processes with order higher than 2 so far is not fully understood .",
    "the concept of evaluating antenna performances by probing photoluminescence of the antenna material is based on the dependence of the photoluminescence signal on the strength of the local fields generated upon illumination .",
    "both 1ppl and 2ppl can be easily observed , however , 2ppl is often employed since many of the investigated structures exhibit a resonance in the near infrared such that for resonant excitation the energy of a single photon is too small to generate 1ppl .",
    "furthermore , the amount of recorded 2ppl emission quadratically depends on the excitation intensity , which allows one to clearly distinguish resonant structures with strong local fields from off - resonant structures that exhibit much lower near - field intensity .",
    "similar arguments apply for other nonlinear ( multiphoton ) processes that may occur , such as harmonic generation or frequency mixing @xcite .",
    "a way to optically probe the spatial distribution of near - field intensity of an antenna mode with reasonable resolution has been the use of a near - field scattering probe oriented perpendicular to the sample surface , which is scanned in close proximity to the antenna @xcite .",
    "the basic idea behind such experiments is that a certain antenna mode is being excited by far - field illumination with a well - defined polarization ( usually parallel to the antenna axis for linear antennas ) . at the wavelength of illumination",
    ", the near - field scattering probe is assumed to possess a non - negligible polarizability only along its main axis .",
    "this direction can be chosen to be perpendicular to the polarization of the illumination field .",
    "the probe is therefore not directly excited and its induced dipole can not contribute to any mode hybridization .",
    "however , around the antenna structure of interest , depolarization fields build up which possess vector components along the main axis of the scattering probe .",
    "the scattering probe then becomes efficiently polarized and scatters a signal into the far field which is polarized perpendicular to the fields directly scattered by the antenna .",
    "both signals can therefore be detected separately . in general",
    ", the scattering probe will be as small as possible , which in turn causes the scattering signal to be very small .",
    "it is therefore usually amplified by means of heterodyne and lock - in detection @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the perpendicular orientation of scattering probe and antenna leads to a minimal back action of the probe on the antenna resonance .",
    "this explains why experimentally recorded antenna mode patterns match so well with theoretical expectations .",
    "[ tppl](a ) shows an example of such sub - diffraction mapping of an antenna mode , which is able to spatially resolve 5 individual intensity maxima of a higher - order antenna mode on a au single - wire antenna @xcite .",
    "since an interferometric setup with a reference beam is used , the phase of the measured fields can be determined as well .",
    "similar experiments have been performed for a number of different plasmonic oscillators @xcite .    while scattering probes allow for sub - diffraction imaging of antenna near fields after far - field illumination , aperture probes - characterized by a sub - wavelength hole at the apex - offer the possibility of local excitation of an optical antenna .",
    "the antenna then emits light into the far field which is eventually collected by a standard objective @xcite .",
    "the measured spatial distribution of far - field photons is determined by the antenna mode and spatial resolution is roughly limited by the size of the aperture .    however , the simplest and most common way to address the spatial pattern of antenna resonances is scanning confocal optical microscopy @xcite .",
    "although it only provides a diffraction - limited excitation spot of about 200 - 250  nm with blue - green light , this technique benefits from its ease of implementation , high photon throughput and good control over light polarization and therefore has been extensively used to characterize optical antennas @xcite .",
    "the overall lateral resolution ( convolution of excitation and detection volumes ) is usually sufficient to single out the response of an optical antenna within a larger ensemble , but it is usually not possible to resolve nanoscale features of the near - field intensity distribution of a single nanoantenna .",
    "this is because the excitation spot is of the order of the antenna dimension , unless the antenna dimensions are particularly large .",
    "it is , however , possible to observe pseudo - resolution in the measured excitation spot of a particular antenna in the sense that lines of zero excitation probability may occur in scan images where excitation of a probed antenna mode is forbidden due to symmetry @xcite .",

    "a viable solution is to scan the antenna in close proximity over some area of a sample . to this end ,",
    "nanoantennas need to be fabricated at the apex of a scanning probe .",

    ", single proteins have been imaged at very high resolution in their native cell membranes @xcite .",
    "highly - sensitive spectroscopy represents another key area for nanoantenna applications , where the antenna serves the purpose of both providing enhanced excitation as well as enhanced emission of the nanoobject under investigation .",
    "in particular , raman signals can be largely enhanced following the already well - established route of surface - enhanced @xcite and tip - enhanced @xcite raman scattering . along this line ,",
    "enhanced raman signals have been measured for ebl - fabricated bow - tie antennas covered with a layer of adsorbed molecules @xcite , showing signatures that are typical for single - molecule raman experiments .",

    "finally , following the original demonstration of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( fcs ) at high analyte concentrations using reduced sensing volumes in subwavelength hole arrays @xcite , recently a 10000 times reduction of the fcs sensing volume has been demonstrated by exploiting the field confinement in optical antennas @xcite .",
    "the highly localized near field of a nanoantenna also finds a natural application in optical lithography , where the fabrication of nanostructures has been accomplished via nonlinear photopolymerization of a photoresist by exploiting both the largely confined and enhanced fields in the gap of a bow - tie antenna and the nonlinearity of resist response @xcite .",
    "experimental studies of single emitters coupled to optical antennas address another key application of resonant optical antennas .",

    "a simple way to achieve the positioning of single emitters in the feed - gap is to directly cover the antenna with a stochastically distributed ensemble of emitters .",

    "as for the third method , quantum dots have been coupled to ag nanowires @xcite which support a propagating plasmonic mode ( see section [ fabryperot ] ) . when a single - photon emitter , such as a quantum dot , is coupled to the ag nanowire , it can excite plasmon quanta that propagate along it and are re - converted to single photons upon emission from the wire end .",
    "notably , non - classical photon correlation has been demonstrated between the emission from the quantum dot and single photons resulting from the decay of the plasmon quanta launched in the ag nanowire .",
    "very recently , even unidirectional emission of a quantum dot which was deterministically coupled to a yagi - uda nanoantenna by means of two - step electron - beam lithography has been experimentally demonstrated @xcite , as discussed in section [ yagiuda ] .",
    "optical tweezing based on field gradients in tightly - focused beams is nowadays a quite established tool in atomic physics and biology @xcite , where it is usually implemented by exploiting microscope objectives with high numerical aperture and properly shaped beam profiles .",
    "since highly localized optical near fields naturally possess strong gradients , their use as localized trapping spots is very appealing and has been proposed already more than a decade ago @xcite .",
    "more recently , the first experimental demonstrations of optical trapping with well - controlled hot spots in the gap of nanoantennas have been published , where the large antenna field enhancement allows trapping with lower excitation power and higher efficiency and stability @xcite .      in the field of optical detectors and solar cells ,",
    "plasmonic structures have been introduced as a means to achieve substantial absorption of incident light within small active volumes and thin layers . indeed",
    ", the earliest interest for resonant antennas in the sub - mm wavelength regime was mostly driven by the need for efficient ir detectors and , with first realization for 10 to 100 @xmath61 m wavelengths @xcite , dates back to the eighties and even before .",
    "dipole , spiral , cat - whisker or bow - tie nanoantennas were produced by means of ebl and the ir detected light was measured by means of a microbolometer or with a micrometer - sized metal - oxide - metal diode .",
    "more recently , an antenna - coupled ge nanodetector for near - ir wavelengths has been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "absorption enhancement is particularly crucial for modern solar cell technologies @xcite , especially for those realizations that move towards thin single - crystal films and intermediate - band nanocrystal insertions . in this context",
    ", efficient coupling of light must be achieved both with broad collection angles and wide spectral response @xcite .",
    "noticeably , semiconductor - based resonant nanostructures , also often called antennas , have been proposed to improve the performances of detectors and solar cells @xcite .    in the field of optical detection and electrical conversion with nanoantennas , it was recently shown that nonlinear tunnelling conduction between gold electrodes separated by a subnanometer gap can lead to optical rectification , producing a dc photocurrent when the gap is illuminated @xcite .",
    "plasmonic sensors based on the adsorption of molecules onto functionalized noble - metal systems have nowadays become a reality and find many applications .",
    "gold is the preferred material in this field because of its biocompatibility and easy functionalization mainly by means of sulfur bonds between gold atoms and molecules .",
    "commercially applied plasmonic sensing is based on attenuated total internal reflection and exploits the fact that the wavevector of surface plasmon polaritons ( spp ) propagating at the interface between a thin gold film and an adjacent dielectric is very sensitive to changes in the refractive index of the dielectric @xcite .",
    "high sensitivity is thus achieved thanks to the strong confinement of fields in the close proximity of the interface . on the other side ,",
    "such spp sensors are based on a relatively complicated setup , which does not always meet the criteria required for commercialization , mass production and use , especially for portable apparatuses and point - of - care testing . moreover , such systems require a rather large surface area and are therefore not suitable for parallelization and integration in view of lab - on - a - chip platforms .    more recently , however , the demonstration of sensors based on localized particle resonances opened new perspectives for plasmonic sensing , where in principle much simpler transmission , reflection , or scattering measurements can be performed because the local refractive index change upon ligand binding directly translates into a shift of the particle s resonance frequency . sensing based on particle arrays on a fiber facet @xcite or on a substrate @xcite",
    "has thus been demonstrated , ultimately with sensitivities down to the single - particle level @xcite . while the improved field localization provides sensitivities comparable to commercial spp devices @xcite ,",
    "there is also a potential for parallelization and miniaturization . along this road , since plasmonic nanoantenna systems display localized resonances that strongly depend on the dielectric properties of the environment , they are very good candidates for sensing applications down to extremely low concentrations .",
    "narrow resonances with large quality factors are advantageous in this context since they provide increased sensitivity . therefore the use of fano - like resonances @xcite and of dark antibonding antenna modes @xcite has been proposed in this context .",
    "so far , we mainly focused our attention on the field enhancement and spatial confinement in optical antennas as well as on their resonances in the frequency - domain .",
    "however , one may also consider the behavior of nanoantennas in the time - domain and discuss the temporal characteristics of the confined fields as well as their coherent control .",
    "it has been shown theoretically by m.  i.  stockman that , upon ultrafast excitation , random metal surfaces with nanoscale geometrical features can exhibit ultrafast nanoscale localization and enhancement in their near fields due to multiple interference @xcite . by controlling the temporal profile of the excitation pulse , field localization , i.e.  the position of hot spots and the exact moment of time when they become active ,",
    "can be coherently controlled @xcite .",
    "the temporal profile of the excitation pulse can be shaped at will by manipulating the spectral phase and amplitude of the laser pulses used for excitation @xcite . in this way",
    "coherent spatio - temporal control of localized near fields has been realized experimentally using antenna - like gold nanostructures @xcite .",
    "since the behavior of metallic nanostructures , including nanoantennas , is time - invariant , once the impulse response of the system under certain excitation conditions is known , one may apply shaped excitation pulses and coherently control the antenna near fields . using this concept , huang _",
    "_ theoretically demonstrated that the temporal profile of the local fields in the gap of a nanoantenna or at a given position on an antenna nanocircuit can be optimized @xcite .",
    "similar techniques might facilitate signal processing in future plasmonic optical nanocircuitry . also recently ,",
    "have shown that the near - field in a hybrid nanoplasmonic - photonic system induced by an ultrashort pulse can be enhanced or turned off by a well controlled pulse following the excitation pulse @xcite . such a switching control based on near - field interference should in principle",
    "be applicable to plasmonic nanoantennas as well .",
    "the detection and analysis of all such phenomena , however , experimentally relies on the generation of non - linear signals that propagate to the far field , such as e.g.  third harmonic generation @xcite .    as a general remark",
    ", it is worth recalling that noble metals are known to possess extremely large optical nonlinearities , but have generally not been considered as nonlinear materials because of their high reflectivity . in this context ,",
    "nanostructured systems offer the possibility to engineer the field penetration inside the material and fully exploit their nonlinear response @xcite .",
    "it is also important to note that , when e.g.  second - harmonic generation is considered for nanoparticles illuminated with a localized field , not only the symmetry of the bulk crystal structure , but also that of the field and of the nanoparticles needs to be taken into account in order to derive the relevant selection rules that can be significantly different from those of plane - wave illumination of bulk systems @xcite .",
    "second - harmonic enhancement at correspondence with a plasmonic resonance has clearly been shown @xcite .",
    "taking advantage of the field concentration ability of optical antennas , practical applications using nanoantennas to generate higher harmonic emission signals have been proposed and demonstrated experimentally .",
    "third - harmonic photons have been efficiently generated in isolated gold dipole antennas @xcite and a clear connection between third - harmonic efficiency and antenna resonances has been demonstrated .",
    "exploited the enhanced and confined field of nanosized bow - tie antennas on a sapphire substrate to reduce the excitation pulse energy required to generate extreme ultraviolet light by high - harmonic generation @xcite .",
    "nanoantennas can also be applied to enhance the efficiency of wave mixing of infrared laser beams .",
    "danckwerts _ et al .",
    "_  have shown that the four - wave mixing signal can be enhanced by 4 orders of magnitude as the gap of a nanoparticle pair shrinks @xcite .",
    "the four - wave mixing signal drastically changes when the two particles are in contact because the gap is shortened and the charge can redistribute via the conductive bridging .",
    "the use of the frequency mixing signal as a precise and sensitive indication of touching contact between two plasmonic nanoparticles has therefore been proposed @xcite .    in perspective , the combination of laser pulse shaping and well - designed nanoantenna geometries might lead to a number of novel applications since it opens the possibility to manipulate the temporal behavior of the antenna near fields . also here , the rather broad antenna resonances are advantageous to achieve a very high temporal resolution .",
    "a very intriguing perspective is given by the possibility of using a plasmonic resonator as a localized cavity for surface plasmon amplification by stimulated emission of radiation ( spaser ) , as originally proposed by bergman and stockmann @xcite .",
    "a first step along this line has been achieved with the demonstration of stimulated emission of spps propagating at the interface with a gain medium @xcite . in one case , also",
    "laser - like emission accompanied by a clear threshold behavior and moderate line narrowing was observed @xcite , although no clear feedback mechanism could be identified .    in this context",
    ", metal nanoparticles acting as optical antennas can play a role because of their large local field enhancement and extremely reduced interaction volume . very recently , subwavelength plasmon lasers based on the original spaser proposal have been demonstrated @xcite . larger enhancement and confinement , compared to single particles , can especially be encountered in the gap of two - wire or bow - tie nanoantennas . along this line ,",
    "laser operation for bow - tie antennas coupled to semiconducting quantum dots or multiple quantum wells has been theoretically addressed @xcite .",
    "sub - diffraction propagation in plasmonic waveguides offers the possibility of distributing and processing e.m .",
    "signals on a very small footprint , thus offering the perspective of combining the speed of photonics with the high degree of integration of modern microelectronics @xcite . in this frame ,",
    "optical antennas - working as receiving and transmitting devices - represent an interface between subwavelength localized modes that propagate along transmission lines and free - space propagating waves @xcite .",
    "wireless optical interconnects based on matched optical antennas have also been suggested @xcite , which could be used as high - speed links in chip architectures .    in terms of interfacing electronics and plasmonics",
    ", it is of course mandatory to efficiently convert electrical signals into plasmon waves and vice - versa .",
    "recently , electrical sources @xcite and electrical detection @xcite of plasmons have been realized .",
    "also , electrical , mechanical , or optical tuning of nanoantennas by means of anisotropic load materials @xcite , stretchable elastomeric films @xcite , or photoconductive gap loads @xcite has been proposed and demonstrated .",
    "resonant metal nanoparticles at optical frequencies are very efficient absorbers mostly due to considerable ohmic losses . however , there are fields in which this supposed drawback turns into a dramatic advantage , since plasmonic nanoparticles can be viewed as nanolocalized heat sources that can be turned on and off by standard optical means at relatively low powers .",
    "this idea finds its most significant application in photothermal therapies , where functionalized metal nanoparticles and nanoshells have been used to demonstrate selective targeting of tumor tissues @xcite and drug delivery @xcite .",
    "plasmon - assisted photoacoustic imaging has been proposed as well @xcite .",
    "thermal hot spots are also at the basis of heat - assisted magnetic recording , in which writing heads equipped with nanoantenna systems are used to confine heating within a mesoscopic volume , thus achieving very small bit sizes @xcite . in the context of plasmonic nanostructures , localized thermal fields have also been successfully exploited to achieve thermal imaging of single au nanoparticle down to 2.5  nm @xcite and to develop hybrid heat - assisted nano - patterning techniques @xcite .",
    "many efforts have been devoted and are still needed to gain a correct understanding of heat flows at the nanoscale , where evanescent thermal fields play a significant role in radiative heat transfer @xcite .",
    "remarkably , when plasmonic nanostructures are used to generate localized thermal fields , care needs to be taken since optimization for local heating can lead to different requirements than for enhanced scattering of photons @xcite . consequently , also the localization of thermal hot spots can differ significantly form that of optical hot spots , as demonstrated experimentally by baffou _",
    "et al . _ for a au dipole antenna @xcite .",
    "in addition to using the heat itself , the heat - induced morphology transformation of nanorods has also been utilized to achieve five - dimensional high density recording @xcite .",
    "while three dimensions are provided by controlling the position of the laser focal spot , two additional dimensions can be achieved utilizing the wavelength and polarization sensitive resonances of the nanorods , which work as optical antennas .    finally , an intriguing possibility is provided by the use of nanoantennas that are specifically designed to achieve efficient radiation of thermal fields @xcite , as recently demonstrated with dielectric nanostructures @xcite .",
    "we hope that this _ tour de force _ on optical antennas has been able to show how lively and flowering this area of research is .",
    "the first ideas can be traced back to the efforts of bringing rf antennas down to the thz domain in the eighties and to the development of optimized optical near - field probes @xcite .",
    "the regime of optical frequencies has been fully addressed in 2004 - 2005 , which triggered an exponentially increasing interest in nanoantennas accompanied by numerous major breakthroughs which seems to continue with unwaning vigour . today",
    "the possibility of using optical antennas to manipulate light at the nanometer scale has become a reality and an enormous number of applications is at hand .    during the preparation of this review",
    ", we obviously had to make choices about what to include and what to exclude from our discussion , as explicitly stated in section 6 .",
    "this unavoidably makes our report fragmentary but , as we hope , still complete within its subset of arguments .",
    "as we have seen , proof of principles which take advantage of the enhanced light - matter interaction afforded by optical antennas have already been demonstrated for many of their potential applications .",
    "this includes nanoscale microscopy , spectroscopy , lithography , quantum optics , sensing , trapping , photovoltaics , and many others . while all these results clearly show the potential of nanoantennas , we can probably safely state that a widespread use of all these possibilities in everyday research - not even to mention everyday life - is still far ahead .",
    "many big steps are still needed which so far could not be reached because of the difficulty in achieving the required levels of nanostructuring precision and reproducibility towards `` mass production '' of nanoantennas over extended areas .",
    "a second open key point , which is under intensive study both theoretically and experimentally , is how to achieve the best coupling between a quantum emitter and an optical antenna system .",
    "finally , in view of true plasmonic circuitry , the concepts of impedance matching and lumped plasmonic elements are still calling for a deeper understanding when it comes to the application of standard rf strategies to the plasmonic realm .",
    "hopefully , this review will help many researchers and students in particular to enter this exciting field of research .",
    "for people already working in the field , we hope that it will spark new discussions between colleagues and foster collaborations to soon make `` future '' applications a reality .",
