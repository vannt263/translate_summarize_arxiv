    "dwarf novae ( dne ) are a subclass of cataclysmic variable stars ( cvs ) and consist of a close binary system containing a white dwarf and a roche - lobe filling red - dwarf star ( @xcite ) .",
    "the orbital periods ( @xmath6 ) of ordinary hydrogen - rich dne range from 76  min to 5.7  d ( @xcite ) .",
    "dne having short orbital periods of @xmath7 tend to exhibit two types of outbursts , normal outbursts and superoutbursts .",
    "such systems are called su  uma - type dne .",
    "su  uma stars exhibit short - term periodic modulations , so - called superhumps , during superoutbursts .",
    "superhumps can be a good indicator of the orbital period of a binary system because it is well known that their periods are slightly ( about a few percent ) longer than the orbital period ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the outburst behavior of su  uma stars can be explained by the thermal  tidal instability model for the accretion disk around the white dwarf ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "it is widely believed that the evolution of a cv having @xmath8 is driven by angular momentum removal from the binary , associated with gravitational radiation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . by losing angular momentum",
    ", the cv evolves toward a shorter @xmath6 regime , until the onset of degeneracy in the secondary star .",
    "after the onset of degeneracy , the cv evolves toward a longer @xmath6 regime since the mass  radius relation of the secondary star changes .",
    "this scenario gives a qualitative explanation for the presence of a short - period cut - off at @xmath9 in the observed @xmath6 distribution .",
    "however , the predicted period minimum ( @xmath10 ) is significantly shorter than the observed minimum ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there are two notable exceptions of hydrogen - rich cvs having @xmath6 much shorter than the well - known @xmath10 at @xmath11 : v485  cen ( @xmath12 ) and ei  psc ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "a characteristic feature of these two is clear tio absorption bands observed in their quiescent spectrum , which indicate luminous secondary stars .",
    "it is proposed that these systems have evolved secondaries and as a result their evolutionary paths are different from that of cvs having a main - sequence secondary ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite proposed that v485  cen - like objects may be progenitors of helium cvs , so - called am  cvn stars , which are recognized as being interacting double white dwarfs .",
    "if this is the case , we can expect that progenitors of v485  cen - like objects are hidden in the cv population having @xmath14 .",
    "such objects should have evolved secondaries , and hence , high mass - transfer rates compared with cvs having main - sequence secondaries ( @xcite ) .    @xcite pointed out that there is a large diversity in dne having very short @xmath6 , particularly in terms of the recurrence time of superoutbursts ( supercycle ; @xmath15 ) .",
    "it is well known that most systems have quite long supercycles of @xmath16 in the shortest period regime of @xmath17 .",
    "these are called wz  sge stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the shortest @xmath6 regime also includes er  uma stars , such as di  uma ( @xmath18 ) , which have very short @xmath15 ( @xmath19@xmath20 ) ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . v844  her is a unique object also having quite short @xmath6 ( 78.6859  min ) in terms of the intermediate @xmath15 ( 260  d ) , which is rather typical for a dn having a longer period of @xmath21 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the nature of the diversity in @xmath15 is poorly understood .    according to the disk instability model , @xmath15 depends on the mass - transfer rate ;",
    "a higher mass - transfer rate yields a short @xmath15 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mass - transfer rate at each @xmath6 depends on the binary parameters , such as the structure of the secondary star .",
    "hence , the diversity in @xmath15 possibly indicates that dne in the shortest @xmath6 regime includes several groups with different secondary star structures , or in other words different evolutionary paths of the binary .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that the diversity in @xmath15 arises from the diversity of the disk structure or the outburst mechanism . in order to investigate the origin of the @xmath15 diversity ,",
    "detailed studies are required of the subgroups which may be present in the shortest @xmath6 regime , though the number of objects is small , apart from wz  sge stars .",
    "in this paper we report detailed observations of a new dn having a short @xmath6 .",
    "the object , ot  j055717@xmath0683226 ( hereafter , j0557@xmath068 ) , was discovered on an image taken on 2006 dec 16.6 ( ut ) by w. kloehr ( @xcite ) .",
    "our time - series observations showed periodic modulations analogous to superhumps observed in su  uma - type dne ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also found that j0557@xmath068 is a peculiar system in terms of its @xmath15 , which is much shorter than those of wz  sge stars .    as well as j0557@xmath068 , several objects in the shortest @xmath6 regime have recently been discovered and well studied .",
    "the increasing sample size of short-@xmath6 dne now allows us to perform a quantitative classification of dne .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe our observation equipment and image reduction . in  3 , we report the detailed outburst features of j0557@xmath068 . in  4 , we provide a new exploratory classification of dne using a hierarchical cluster analysis .",

    "the calculated boundaries are indicated by solid curves in figure  [ fig : svm ] . as can be seen in figure  [ fig : svm ] ,",
    "the boundaries fail to identify several groups : no boundary is given for _ group er _ and _ su / wz _ in the @xmath65@xmath6 plane , and the boundary of _ group di _ is given only for @xmath85@xmath6 plane .",
    "this is because the number of the sample is small and the members of these groups are blended in the other group members in the @xmath65@xmath6 plane .    in table",

    "these objects were classified following the boundaries estimated by svm .",
