    "the question concerning the nature of a mott metal - insulator phase transition ( mit ) poses one of the most fundamental problems in condensed - matter physics .",
    "it becomes an even greater challenge in the case of materials with a strong interplay between electronic correlations and lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "the most famous example is v@xmath0o@xmath1 which has generally been considered to be the classical example of a material with a mott - hubbard mit @xcite . under ambient conditions",
    ", v@xmath0o@xmath1 is a paramagnetic metal with a corundum crystal structure ( space group @xmath5 ) @xcite . upon doping with cr it undergoes a phase transition to a paramagnetic mott - hubbard insulator without change of crystal symmetry @xcite .",
    "the transition from the paramagnetic insulator ( pi ) to the paramagnetic metal ( pm ) can also be triggered by doping with cr , which essentially amounts to the application of a negative pressure .",
    "the mit is intimately linked with an abrupt expansion of the lattice volume by @xmath6 % and a reduction of the @xmath7 lattice parameter ratio by @xmath8 % across the mit , indicating a strong coupling between electronic and lattice degrees of freedom @xcite . in spite of intensive research over several decades , an explanation of this mutual influence of electronic structure and phase stability of paramagnetic v@xmath0o@xmath1 at the mit is still missing . therefore investigations of v@xmath0o@xmath1",
    "continue with a high level of activity @xcite .",
    "a realistic description of v@xmath0o@xmath1 requires taking into account the interplay of electronic correlations and lattice degrees of freedom on a microscopic level .",
    "state - of - the - art methods for the calculation of the band structure , which allow for _ ab initio _ computations of the electronic and structural properties , can account for neither the mit nor the paramagnetic insulating phase of v@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this obstacle can be overcome by employing the lda / gga+dmft approach @xcite , a combination of band - structure methods in the local - density approximation ( lda ) or the generalized - gradient approximation ( gga ) with dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) of strongly correlated electrons @xcite .",
    "applications of lda+dmft have already provided a good quantitative description of the electronic structure and spectral properties of v@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite . in particular , it was found that in all phases the v@xmath9 ions are in a @xmath10 spin configuration , with a mixed ( @xmath11 , @xmath4 ) and ( @xmath4 , @xmath4 ) orbital occupation",
    ". these calculations also allow one to perform a direct comparison of the calculated spectra with , e.g. , photoemission , x - ray absorption , and optical conductivity measurements near the metal - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "the lda+dmft results capture all generic aspects of a mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition , such as a coherent quasiparticle behavior , formation of the lower- and upper - hubbard bands , and strong renormalization of the effective electron mass .",
    "in addition , these calculations reveal an orbital - selective behavior of the electron coherence and a strong enhancement of the crystal - field splitting between the @xmath11 and @xmath4 bands , caused by electron correlations at the mit @xcite . despite this success",
    "the coupling between electronic correlations and lattice structure at the mott - hubbard mit in v@xmath0o@xmath1 is still poorly understood .",
    "we will address this problem in our investigation and thereby shed new light on the long - standing question regarding the origin of the structural changes in the vicinity of the mit .",
    "in this paper we employ the gga+dmft computational approach @xcite to explore the electronic and structural properties of paramagnetic v@xmath0o@xmath1 across the mott - hubbard mit .",
    "in particular , we will explore the structural phase stability of paramagnetic v@xmath0o@xmath1 , i.e. , the influence of electronic correlations on the _ structural _ transition .",
    "we first compute the electronic structure of paramagnetic v@xmath0o@xmath1 within the nonmagnetic gga using the plane - wave pseudopotential approach @xcite . to investigate the structural stability",
    ", we use the atomic positions and the c / a lattice parameter ratio of v@xmath0o@xmath1 taken from experiment @xcite . to this end",
    ", we adopt the crystal structure data for paramagnetic metallic v@xmath0o@xmath1 and insulating ( v@xmath12cr@xmath13)@xmath0o@xmath1 , respectively , and calculate the total energy as a function of volume . in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] ( inset ) we show the results of the nonmagnetic gga total energy calculations , which agree with previous band structure results @xcite . in particular , we find equilibrium lattice constants @xmath14   for the pm phase and 4.955   for the pi phase of v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the calculated bulk moduli are @xmath15 gpa for both phases .",
    "these results are in neither quantitative nor even qualitative agreement with experiment .",
    "namely , they give a metallic solution with no structural phase transition between the pm and pi phases .",
    "clearly , standard band - structure techniques can not explain the properties of paramagnetic v@xmath0o@xmath1 since they do not treat electronic correlations adequately .",
    "therefore we now compute the electronic structure and phase stability of v@xmath0o@xmath1 using the gga+dmft computational scheme @xcite . for the partially filled v @xmath3 orbitals , which split into @xmath11 and @xmath4 bands due to a trigonal distortion",
    ", we construct a basis of atomic centered symmetry - constrained wannier functions @xcite .",
    "to solve the realistic many - body problem within dmft , we employ the continuous - time hybridization - expansion quantum monte - carlo algorithm @xcite .",
    "the calculations are performed at the temperature @xmath16 390 k , which is below the critical endpoint of @xmath17 k @xcite .",
    "we use values of the coulomb interaction @xmath18 ev and hund s exchange @xmath19 ev , in accordance with the previous theoretical and experimental estimations @xcite .",
    "the @xmath20 and @xmath21 values are assumed to remain constant across the phase transition , which is consistent with recent hard x - ray photoemission experiments @xcite .",
    "furthermore we employ the fully - localized double - counting correction , calculated from the self - consistently determined local occupancies , to account for the electronic interactions already described by the gga .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] ( main panel ) we display the calculated variation of the total energy of paramagnetic v@xmath0o@xmath1 as a function of lattice volume .",
    "our results for the equilibrium lattice constant and bulk modulus , which now include the effect of electronic correlations , agree well with experiment @xcite .",
    "the calculated equilibrium lattice constants are @xmath22 5.005 and 5.035   for the pm and pi phases , respectively .",
    "the corresponding bulk moduli are @xmath23 202 and 222 gpa . in agreement with previous studies @xcite ,",
    "our results show an orbital - dependence of the electron coherence , with coherent quasiparticle behavior for the @xmath11 orbital , while the @xmath4 bands remain incoherent , with a large imaginary part of the self - energy at @xmath16 390 k. we also evaluated the spectral function of paramagnetic v@xmath0o@xmath1 ( not shown here ) and determined the mit phase boundary .",
    "the mit is found to take place at a positive pressure of @xmath24 125 kbar , implying a @xmath25 % reduction of the lattice volume .",
    "we find that both the @xmath11 and the @xmath4 quasiparticle weights remain finite at the mit ; that is , there is _ no _ divergence of the effective electron mass at the transition as it would occur in a brinkman - rice picture of the mit @xcite .",
    "thus we conclude that the mit is driven by a strong enhancement of the @xmath11@xmath4 crystal - field splitting caused by electron correlations @xcite .",
    "the gga+dmft results are qualitatively different from those obtained with the nonmagnetic gga and provide clear evidence for a structural phase transition .",
    "however , this transition is found to occur at a critical pressure of @xmath26 186 kbar , corresponding to a large ( @xmath27 % ) reduction of the lattice volume .",
    "in addition , the results imply that the pm phase is energetically unfavorable at ambient pressure , i.e. , thermodynamically unstable , with a total energy difference with respect to the pi phase of @xmath28 20 mev / f.u .. these features are in contrast to experiment .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy can be ascribed to the lack of charge self - consistency in the present calculations .",
    "indeed , a strong enhancement of the @xmath11@xmath4 crystal - field splitting will cause a substantial redistribution of the charge density and thereby influence the lattice structure due to electron - lattice coupling .",
    "all this makes charge self - consistency @xcite particularly important at the metal - insulator transition .",

    "the pm phase is now found to be thermodynamically stable at ambient pressure , with a total - energy difference between the pm and pi phases of @xmath29 3 mev / f.u .",
    "the structural transition takes place upon a slight expansion of the lattice , @xmath30 1.5 % , at a negative critical pressure of @xmath31  kbar , in agreement with experiment .",
    "the phase transition is accompanied by an abrupt increase of the lattice volume by @xmath32 0.5 % and a simultaneous change of the @xmath7 ration by @xmath32 1.5 % .",
    "this result is seen to differ significantly from that obtained with the non - charge - self - consistent gga+dmft scheme , according to which the pm phase is thermodynamically unstable at ambient pressure .",
    "the calculated equilibrium lattice constants and bulk moduli are now in remarkably good agreement with experiment @xcite . in particular , we obtain @xmath33 and 5.021   for the pm and pi phases , respectively , which is less than @xmath34 % larger than the experimental values .",
    "the calculated bulk moduli are @xmath35 and 204 gpa , respectively .",
    "we note that the bulk modulus in the pi phase is somewhat smaller than that in the pm phase , which implies an _ enhancement _ of the compressibility at the phase transition .",
    "furthermore , the total - energy calculation results exhibit a weak anomaly near the mit , which is associated with a divergence of the compressibility , in accordance with previous model calculations @xcite .",
    "overall , the electronic structure , the equilibrium lattice constant , and the structural phase stability of paramagnetic v@xmath0o@xmath1 obtained with the fully charge self - consistent gga+dmft scheme are in remarkably good agreement with the experimental data .",

    "[ fig_3 ] we present our results obtained with the fully charge self - consistent gga+dmft approach for paramagnetic v@xmath0o@xmath1 across the mit .",
    "our calculations show that the v@xmath9 ions are in a @xmath10 spin configuration in all phases , with a predominant occupation of the @xmath4 bands and substantial admixture of the @xmath11 orbital .",
    "the admixture is almost independent of changes of the lattice volume ( deviations @xmath38 % ) , with a small decrease at the structural transition .",
    "our results for the ( @xmath11 , @xmath4 ) orbital occupations at the phase transition are ( 0.44 , 0.78 ) for the pm phase and ( 0.42 , 0.79 ) for the pi phase of v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
