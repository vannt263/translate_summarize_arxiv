    "the central theme in spintronics is the generation and control of nonequilibrium electron spin in solids.@xcite until recently the spin generation has been done by optical , magnetic , and , most important for device prospects , electrical means.@xcite in a typical device spin - polarized electrons from a ferromagnetic conductor are driven by electromagnetic force to a nonmagnetic conductor .",
    "there the spin accumulates , with the steady state facilitated by spin relaxation .",
    "( there are also novel ways to generate pure spin currents , without accompanying charge currents.@xcite ) the concept of electrical spin injection was first proposed by aronov,@xcite and experimentally confirmed by johnson and silsbee,@xcite who also formulated the problem from a nonequilibrium thermodynamics and drift - diffusion view.@xcite an equivalent description in terms of quasichemical potentials , convenient to treat discrete ( junction ) systems was formulated systematically by rashba.@xcite this model , which we call the standard model of spin injection , is widely used to describe electrical spin injection into metals and semiconductors@xcite and can also be extended to ac currents.@xcite    until recently one particularly interesting possibility of generating spin , by spin - heat coupling , has been largely neglected .",
    "the generation of nonequilibrium spin by heat currents and the opposite process of generating heat currents by spin accumulation has already been proposed by johnson and silsbee@xcite based on nonequilibrium thermodynamics concepts ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "the spin - heat coupling is now the central point of spin caloritronics ( or spin calorics).@xcite although the theory of thermoelectricity has long been known,@xcite only experimental improvements over the past few years have made its application in the context of generating and transporting spin appear possible.@xcite     is the temperature difference , @xmath0 the voltage , @xmath1 the charge current , @xmath2 the spin current , and vertical arrows denote up / down spin projections.,width=302 ]    at the heart of spin caloritronics is the spin seebeck effect ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : seebeck]).@xcite the conventional seebeck effect , also called thermopower,@xcite describes the generation of an electric voltage if a thermal gradient is applied to a conductor . in analogy ,",
    "the spin seebeck effect describes the generation of spin accumulation in ferromagnets by thermal gradients .",
    "the effect was originally observed in the ferromagnetic conductor nife,@xcite where indication of spin accumulation over large length scales ( millimeters ) , independent of the spin relaxation scales in the ferromagnet , was found .",
    "since it also exists at room temperature , the spin seebeck phenomenon may have some technological applications.@xcite    however , the spin seebeck effect is not limited to metals .",
    "it has also been observed in ferromagnetic insulators@xcite as well as in the ferromagnetic semiconductor ( ga , mn)as.@xcite this suggests that the spin seebeck effect does not need to be connected with charge flow . in ( ga , mn)as the sample was even cut preventing charge redistribution over the whole slab ; the spin seebeck signals were unaffected and in both cases , of compact and disconnected samples , the pt stripes pick up the same inverse spin hall signals.@xcite the evidence points to a mechanism of magnon - assisted spin pumping from the ferromagnet into the pt , producing spin currents there .",
    "a theory for this spin pumping from a ferromagnetic insulator was suggested in ref .  .",
    "it was predicted that phonons can play an important role in the spin seebeck effect , leading to its huge enhancement.@xcite recent measurements of the spin seebeck effect in multiple ( ga , mn)as samples also suggest that the spin seebeck effect can be driven by phonons.@xcite in order to explain the main trends of the observed temperature and spatial dependence of the spin seebeck effect in ( ga , mn)as , a phenomenological model involving phonon - magnon coupling was introduced.@xcite     and @xmath2 denote the charge and spin currents .",
    "the thermal current @xmath3 is different in each region .",
    "small vertical arrows denote up / down spin projections.,width=302 ]    in addition to the seebeck effect , there is also another thermoelectric effect , the peltier effect , which refers to the evolution of heat across an isothermal junction of two different materials due to an electric current being passed through the junction.@xcite recently a spin caloritronics analog to the peltier effect , termed spin peltier effect , has been predicted and experimentally observed in a permalloy ( ni@xmath4fe@xmath5)(py)/copper / py valve stack.@xcite the spin peltier effect describes the heating or cooling at the interface between a ferromagnetic and normal conductor driven by a spin current ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : peltier ] ) .",
    "another fascinating discovery is that of the thermally driven spin injection from a ferromagnet to a normal conductor.@xcite in this experiment thermal currents in permalloy drive spin accumulation into copper , detected in a non - local geometry.@xcite the structures were of submicron sizes , so it is plausible that the effects are electronic in nature , although magnon contributions to such thermal spin injection setups could also be sizable .",
    "a practical model was introduced in refs .   to find , with a finite elements numerical scheme , the profiles of temperature and spin accumulation in the experimental devices .",
    "recently , yet another form of thermal spin flow , coined seebeck spin tunneling , has been demonstrated in ferromagnet - oxide - silicon tunnel junctions.@xcite here a temperature difference between the ferromagnet and silicon causes a transfer of spin angular momentum across the interface between both materials .",
    "an important goal for both theory and experiment of the spin seebeck phenomena is to decipher the roles of the electronic and non - electronic contributions .",
    "it is yet unclear under which circumstances the electronic contribution may dominate .",
    "it seems likely that when going to smaller , submicron structures in which the spin accumulation will be a bulk effect , the spin phenomena carried by electrons will become important .",
    "similarly , in materials with strong magnon damping , such that magnons are in local equilibrium with the given temperature profile , electrons may ultimately carry the entire spin seebeck effect .",
    "it is thus important to set the benchmarks for the electronic contributions in useful device geometries .",
    "this is what this paper does : we explore the role of the electronic contributions in f / n and f / n / f junctions which are subjected to thermal gradients and derive useful analytical formulas for various spin injection efficiencies .",
    "our purpose is twofold : first , we use the drift - diffusion framework of the standard model of spin injection presented in refs .   and generalize it to include electronic heat transport and thereby derive a theory for charge , spin , and heat transport in electronic materials .",
    "secondly , we apply this theory to describe f / n and f / n / f junctions placed in thermal gradients . while the peltier and seebeck effects in such structures have been investigated in ref .  , we focus here on the description of thermal spin injection and the investigation of the corresponding spin accumulation .",
    "we also look at the spin injection in the presence of both electric and thermal currents , and find the conditions under which the resulting spin current in n vanishes . in all junctions",
    "studied we present , as general as possible , analytical formulas for the spin accumulation and spin current profiles , as well as for the thermal spin injection efficiency and the nonequilibrium ( spin accumulation driven ) spin seebeck coefficient .",
    "moreover , we look at several different setups of the peltier and spin peltier effects and calculate their respective contributions to the heating / cooling at the interfaces in f / n and f / n / f junctions .",
