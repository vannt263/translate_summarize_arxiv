    "the long standing efforts for building cherenkov detectors in sea depths started with the dumand project that measured the muon vertical intensity at depths ranging between 2 and 4 km with a prototype line at a depth of 4.8 km about 30 km off - shore the island of hawaii in nov .",
    "1987 @xcite .",
    "the project was canceled in 1995 , while in 1993 a first configuration of 36 phototubes ( pmts ) on 3 strings ( nt-36 ) was installed in lake baikal in siberia at the shallow depth of 1.1 km , 3.6 km off - shore @xcite .",
    "the latest configuration of the experiment ( nt-200 + ) was put into operation in apr .",
    "2005 , with an umbrella - like structure of 8 strings 72 m long , with pairs of up - looking and down - looking pmts with 37-cm photocatodes .",
    "three external strings at 100 m from the center of nt200 have been added to increase the sensitivity at very high energies for cascades .",
    "lake water compared to sea water offers the advantage of being a quieter environment and the frozen surface in winter can be used as a platform for deploying and replacing broken components .",
    "nonetheless , the optical background can be more seasonal dependent than in sea water and the absorption length for blue light ( 480 nm ) is about 20 m , while in sea water it is typically between 50 - 60 m. both for sea water and lake water the scattering length , which mainly affects the angular resolution of neutrino telescopes , is between 15 - 70 m , but the angular distribution of scattered photons is very forward peaked ( @xmath0 ) so that the effective scattering length ( @xmath1 can be up to 200 - 300 m. the nestor collaboration begun surveys of an area close to the peloponnese coast at a mean depth of 4 km in the 90s .",
    "they measured recently the muon flux with a hexagonal floor with 12 up - looking and down - looking pmts @xcite and it is studying the possibility to deploy towers of 12 of these floors .",
    "[ fig1 ] summarizes the muon flux measurements of all these projects .",
    "it is noticeable how the agreement of the measurement has improved with time . in the plot",
    ", we also show the results for the first line of antares detector described below @xcite .",
    "the antares collaboration , joining about 150 physicists , engineers , and sea experts from 7 european countries ( france , germany , italy , romania , russia , spain , the netherlands ) and 24 institutions , formed in 1996 .",
    "marine properties of the antares site off - shore la seyne sur mer ( south france ) were studied between 1996 and 2000 in about 45 sea campaigns .",
    "the properties of light propagation at the antares site , 2475 m below the sea level , are summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite : the absorption length in the blue is about 60 m while the effective scattering length is about 250 m. the milestones of the detector construction are the deployment of the 45 km - long main electro - optical cable ( eoc ) in 2001 and of the junction box ( jb ) at its end in 2002 . between 2003 and 2005 various prototype lines and a mini - instrumentation line for environmental parameter measurements where deployed @xcite and in 2006 the first 2 lines of the detector . in 2007",
    "further 8 lines where deployed and on may 30 , 2008 the whole detector made of a total of 12 lines was put into operation .",
    "a scheme of the detector and of the line layout is shown in fig .",
    "lines were connected during 5 submarine operations , one conducted by a submarine and all others by an unmanned remote operated vehicle .",
    "antares is made of 12 lines held taught by buoys and anchored at the sea floor connected to the jb that distributes power and data from / to shore .",
    "the instrumented part of the line starts at 100 m above sea level so that cherenkov light can be seen also from the region below .",
    "lines are separated by 60 - 75 m from each other and each of the lines holds 25 floors called storeys .",
    "each storey has 3 pmts ( hamamtsu 10 \" @xcite ) looking downward at @xmath2 from the vertical housed inside pressure resistant glass spheres made of two halves closed by applying an under - pressure of 200 - 300 mbar .",
    "the set - up including the pmt , the glass sphere , the silicon gel for optical coupling between the glass and the photocathode and the mu - metal cage for shielding the earth magnetic field is called optical module ( om ) @xcite .",
    "storeys also include titanium containers housing the frontend electronics with a pair of asic chips per pmt used for signal processing and digitization that provide the time stamp and amplitude of the pmt signal .",
    "each of the oms contains a pulsed led for calibration of the relative variations of pmt transit time and a system of led and laser optical beacons allows the relative time calibration of different oms .",
    "an internal clock system distributes from shore the 20 mhz clock signal , that is synchronized by gps to the universal time with a precision of @xmath3 ns .",
    "time calibrations allow a precision at the level of 0.5 ns ensuring the capability of achieving an angular resolution at the level of @xmath4 for muons above 10 tev @xcite .",
    "antares is equipped with a positioning system that includes tiltmeters and compasses giving the orientation of storeys and an acoustic triangulation system of hydrophones and transceivers that reconstruct line shapes .",
    "measurement of line displacements show that lines move coherently in the radial direction and that the achievable precision on the relative position is better than 10 cm .",
    "this information can be stored in databases and used by the offline event reconstruction .",
    "all data ( @xmath5 gb / s ) are sent to shore satisfying a l0 condition requiring hits above a threshold of 1/3 of a photoelectron ( pe ) .",
    "a l1 is formed by a local coincidence of 2 l0 in a storey in a 20 ns window or a large pulse above a few pe @xcite .",
    "this data flow rate is reduced by about a factor 1000 by a filter running on a pc farm on shore that looks for 5 l1 and a casual connection between l1 compatible with a light signal produced by a ultra - relativistic muon .",
    "the measured muon trigger rate is about 3 hz in the 10 lines .",
    "in addition dedicated triggers have been developed for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and the galactic centre .",
    "a continuous record of up to 100 s stores temporarily data in memory that can be saved on disk in case of an external trigger from a network of satellites .",
    "the filter is necessary since sea water is an optical noisy environment due to bioluminescence and @xmath6 decay of @xmath7 producing electrons that annihilate and hence produce two photons above cherenkov threshold . in the 10 line configuration we observed that during 80% of the time the optical background rate is about 60 khz .",
    "dedicated calibration runs are taken measuring the coincidence rate of @xmath7 in the same storey and allowing to monitor om efficiency at the level of 5% accuracy .",
    "these efficiencies are used in the measurement of the rate of coincidences in the same storey versus depth as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( on the left ) .",
    "the smooth rate decrease is a measurement of muon energy losses in the detector and a demonstration that sea water is to a large extent a depth independent medium , unlike ice .",
    "dark matter searches are also possible by looking for an excess of neutrinos from celestial bodies like the sun or the galactic centre .",
    "neutrinos with energy below tev could be produced by the annihilation of supersymmetric dark matter particles like the neutralino , that would become gravitationally trapped in this bodies . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show the number of muon neutrino events that could be measured in 3 yrs by antares in the direction of the sun as a function the neutralino mass .",
    "each of the point corresponds to a supersymmetric model ."
