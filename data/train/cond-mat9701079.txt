    "each landau level contains @xmath5 states per unit area , or one state for each magnetic flux quantum @xmath6 , giving rise to a macroscopic landau level degeneracy .",

    "the filling factor also can be expressed as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the magnetic length .",
    "the fractional quantum hall effect can occur when electron - electron interactions dominate disorder . at certain filling factors of the form @xmath12 , with @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    "relative primes and @xmath14 odd , electron - electron interactions cause the condensation of the electrons into highly correlated states .",
    "these states are incompressible with an energy gap separating the ground state from the bulk excited states . however , in a finite system , there must exist gapless excitations localized near the edges  @xcite .",
    "thus , the low - energy physics of finite systems is dominated by the gapless edge modes .",
    "therefore , in is necessary to be able to accurately model edges of fqhe systems in order to explain experiments . in a finite fqhe system with",
    "the potential confining the electrons varying slowly compared to @xmath15 , the electronic structure at the edges may form a series of alternating compressible and incompressible regions with a step - like density profile  @xcite .",
    "in addition to standard transport measurements , there are now a variety of probes to directly study edge structures in inhomogeneous systems .",
    "examples are capacitance spectroscopy of the quantum hall edges  @xcite , time - resolved measurements of edge magnetoplasmons@xcite , and surface acoustic waves techniques which are capable of resolving very small spatial inhomogeneities in the electron density  @xcite .",
    "addition spectroscopy has also been used to study quantum dots with sizes of the order of 100 nm and with 10 to 100 electrons  @xcite .    for an explanation of experimental studies",
    "it is highly desirable to have a computational approach which accurately treats systems with of the order of @xmath16 electrons , and which can include effects such as accurate confinements , spin degrees of freedom , and finite layer thickness .",
    "exact numerical diagonalizations are limited to very small systems ( @xmath17  )  @xcite .",
    "semiclassical methods@xcite do not accurately treat electron - electron interactions , and effective field theories  @xcite can not give accurate quantitative information about many system properties .",
    "a method that can deal with larger number of electrons is the composite fermion theory in the hartree approximation  @xcite .",
    "however , in this approach , the singular chern - simons gauge field is replaced by its smooth spatial average , and the composite fermion mass has to be put into the calculations by hand .",
    "furthermore , interpretation of the results is sometimes difficult and ambiguous . on the other hand , density functional theory ( dft )",
