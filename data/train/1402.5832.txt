    "rigorous mathematical analysis of random operators has been a vital field of mathematical physics for the last few decades . for one - particle systems localization in the spectral and dynamical sense",
    "has been established rigorously in various regimes of energy and disorder both for lattice and continuum models @xcite . despite of its physical relevance , the question of localization in disordered many - particle systems ,",
    "however , is much less understood .",
    "so far , the mathematical analysis of interacting disordered systems with a macroscopic number of particles has been mostly restricted to questions of the existence and properties of thermodynamic quantities @xcite  with the exception of a proof of bose - einstein condensation for the disordered lieb - liniger model in one dimension @xcite .",
    "in the course of the last years , several localization results have been obtained for systems of a fixed number of interacting particles .",
    "persistence of localization has first been established for lattice systems , using multiscale @xcite or fractional moment  @xcite techniques .",
    "the multiscale analysis has been adapted to continuum multiparticle systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , an improved version of the multiscale analysis , commonly referred to as `` bootstrap multiscale analysis '' has recently been extended to multiparticle systems as well , both for lattice @xcite and continuum models @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to complement these results and present an adaption of the multiparticle fractional - moment method developed in @xcite to the continuum .",
    "the corresponding multiparticle random schrdinger operator has an alloy - type external potential and includes an interaction potential with rapidly decaying two - body interaction terms .",
    "we focus on localization in energy regimes at the bottom of the spectrum and pay particular attention to how the strength and the decay of the interaction between different particles affects the localization estimates .",
    "our main results are divided into two different types of decay of the interaction . in the first case , we assume that the interaction between particles located at points @xmath2 and @xmath3 decays ( sub)exponentially , i.e. , as @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this yields strong dynamical localization with decay estimates of the same order , albeit with respect to the `` hausdorff distance '' @xmath7 and not the regular euclidean metric on the configuration space of the particles . in the second case , we only assume fast polynomial decay which allows us to establish localization for systems consisting of at most a maximal number of particles .",
    "although the interaction decays only polynomially , the localization estimates decay as @xmath8 , with @xmath5 and @xmath9 $ ] getting smaller as the particle number increases .    in our analysis",
    "it is essential to switch between different notions of localization , namely fractional moment localization and eigenfunction correlator localization .",
    "section [ section : fmec ] discusses these two terms and their relation in a fairly general way that is of interest in itself and might be of use in other settings as well .",
    "the main goal in that section is a proof that fractional moment localization and eigenfunction correlator localization are equivalent up to the localization length and a small change in the interval of validity .",
    "the main part of our analysis is placed in section [ section : mploc ] .",
    "we prove the inductive step that localization for up to @xmath10 particles implies localization for @xmath11 particles .",
    "we proceed in several steps , first considering partially interactive systems and then using this to prove a `` rescaling inequality '' for the fully interacting systems .",
    "sufficiently good estimates on an initial length scale will then yield localization for the @xmath11-particle system .",
    "finally , in section [ section : proofofmainresults ] , we will use these results to prove the main theorems that are presented in section [ section : mainresults ] .",
