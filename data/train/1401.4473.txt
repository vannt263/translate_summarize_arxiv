    "electric power is indispensable to modern societies .",
    "security and availability of power supply is crucial .",
    "disruption of power delivery systems has severe effects on the public order and substantial economic cost for society  @xcite .",
    "the safe operation of the power grid greatly reduces the risk of large - scale blackouts .",
    "many countries , however , suffer from catastrophic blackouts paralysing daily life  @xcite .",
    "analysis of international blackout data reveals that the probability distribution of the blackout sizes decreases with the size of the blackout in an approximate power law regime  @xcite with an exponent between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , i.e.doubling the blackout size approximately halves its probability suggesting large scale blackouts are more likely than expected .",
    "cascading failures are the consequence of the collective dynamics of the complex power grid .",
    "large scale cascades are typically due to propagation of a local failure into the global network .",
    "consequently , analysing and mitigating cascading failures requires a system level approach .",
    "recent advances in the field of network science  @xcite reveal the promising potential of complex networks theory to investigate power grids vulnerability at a system level .",
    "this paper considers the _ vulnerability _ of a system as a sensitivity to threats ( i.e.malicious attacks ) and disturbances ( e.g.random failures ) that possibly limit the ability of the system to accomplish its tasks , and provide the intended services . as the polar opposite of vulnerability , _ robustness _ refers to the ability of a system to avoid malfunctioning when a fraction of its elements fail  @xcite .",
    "the operative state ( e.g.loading level and power flow distribution ) , the structural aspects of a power grid ( e.g.type of buses and their interconnection ) , and design choices of engineering systems ( e.g.the protection systems , automatic controls , and towers and insulators ) determine the robustness against cascading failures in a power grid .",
    "increasing a power grid robustness requires a careful assessment of engineering system design choices and optimization of the operative state and the topology of the grid .",
    "the operative state of a power grid is continuously changing while the structure remains mainly unchanged .",
    "optimization of the operative state of a power grid is a short - term optimization problem and requires a dynamic optimization approach  @xcite . on the other hand , optimization of the topology",
    "is a long - term optimization problem and requires investigating the impact of the grid topology on cascading failures .",
    "this paper focuses on the optimization of the topology , and investigates the relationship between a power grid topology and its robustness against cascading failures .",
    "one way to analyse the impact of the structural aspects of a power grid on the cascading effect is investigating the relationship between the robustness level against cascading failures and the general network properties of power grids .",
    "the electric power grid has small - world characteristics  @xcite . a small average shortest path length ( together with high clustering coefficient  @xcite ) is one of the key characteristics of the small - world phenomenon . in small - world networks",
    ", the average shortest path length might dominate the network dynamics including , for example disease spreading  @xcite .",
    "these studies / results motivate power system researchers to investigate the impact of average shortest path length on the cascading failures robustness in power grids  @xcite .",
    "they deploy a purely topological approach and assume that electric power behaves as a discrete data packet and follows the shortest or the most efficient path between two nodes . relying on this assumption , the average shortest path length is determined , and its impact on the network robustness is investigated .",
    "however , this purely topological approach does not comply with the fundamental characteristics of power grids .",
    "electric power obeys the laws of kirchoff and flows through all available paths rather than following a distinct path ( e.g.shortest path ) like e.g.a data packet in a data communication network .",
    "therefore , the notion of distance needs to be tailored based on power systems fundamentals .",
    "this paper proposes the _ effective resistance _ as a measure of electrical path length between two nodes , and the _ effective graph resistance _ as a metric referring to electrical average path length of a power grid .",
    "the effective graph resistance  @xcite relates to the impact of the topology on cascading failure robustness while accounting for the fundamental properties of power grids such as power flow distribution through the grid according to kirchoff laws .",
    "a power grid is a three - layered complex interconnected network consisting of generation , transmission , and distribution parts .",
    "electric power is shipped from the generation buses to distribution substations through the transmission buses , all interconnected by transmission lines .",
    "electric power flows in a grid according to kirchoff s laws .",
    "accordingly , impedances , voltage levels at each individual power station , voltage phase differences between power stations and loads at terminal stations control the power flow in the grid . ac power flow equations are non - linear equations that approximate the flows of both active and reactive powers .",
    "dc load flow equations are a linearised version of the ac power flow equations considering only flow of active power  @xcite .",
    "dc power flow analysis introduces an average line flow error up to 5% while it is 7 to 10 times faster than ac load flow model  @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , this paper deploys dc load flow analysis to estimate the flow values across the network .",
    "the maximum capacity ( i.e.flow limit ) of a line is defined as the maximum power flow that can be afforded by the line .",
    "the flow limit of a transmission line is imposed by thermal , stability or voltage drop constraints  @xcite . as many other recent studies  @xcite",
    ", this paper assumes that the maximum capacity of a line relates to its base ( i.e. initial ) load as follows : @xmath2    where _",
    "@xmath3 _ is the maximum capacity , _",
    "@xmath4 _ is the base load , and @xmath5  @xcite is the tolerance parameter of line _",
    "@xmath6_. in a power grid , each line has a relay protecting it from permanent damage due to e.g.excessive flows .",
    "for instance , in case of overloading , an over - current relay notifies a circuit breaker to trip a line when the current of the line exceeds its rated limit ( i.e.maximum capacity ) and this violation lasts long enough to permanently damage the line . for the sake of simplicity , this paper assumes a deterministic model for the line tripping mechanism , i.e.a circuit breaker for a line trips at the moment the flow of the line exceeds its rated limit . while the over - current  @xcite relays are not the only relays that are used in the power transmission grid , this paper models the other type of relaying mechanisms ( e.g. distance and differential protection ) as over - current relays .",
    "an initial outage of a component changes the balance of the power flow distribution over the grid and causes a redistribution of the power flow over the network .",
    "this dynamic response of the system to this triggering event might overload other parts in the network .",
    "the protection mechanism trips these newly overloaded components , and the power flow is again redistributed potentially resulting in new overloads . in case of islanding , cascading failures continue in each island in which generators or loads are shed respectively to attain a power balance .",
    "the cascade of failures continues until no more components are overloaded .",
    "after the cascade subsides , the robustness of the grid against cascading failures is quantified in terms of the fraction of the served power demand ( @xmath7 ) after the cascading failures .",
    "this section explains the relevant basic concepts from complex networks theory , explains the effective graph resistance , and elaborates on how it is computed in electric power grids .      a network _ g(n , l ) _ consisting of a set of nodes _ n _ and links _",
    "l _ , can fully be represented by its adjacency matrix @xmath8 .",
    "the _ adjacency matrix _ of a simple , unweighted graph _",
    "g(n , l ) _ is an @xmath9 symmetric matrix reflecting the interconnection of the nodes in the graph : @xmath10 indicates that there is no edge , otherwise @xmath11 . in case of a weighted graph ,",
    "the network is represented by a weighted adjacency matrix @xmath12 where @xmath13 corresponds to the weight of the line between nodes @xmath6 and @xmath14 ; a weight can be a distance , cost , or delay .",
    "the _ laplacian matrix _",
    "@xcite @xmath15 is another way to fully characterize a graph , and is defined as : @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the diagonal matrix of the strengths of @xmath18 : @xmath19=@xmath20 .",
    "hence , the laplacian can be constructed as follows : @xmath21    where @xmath19 is the strength of node @xmath22 , and _",
    "l _ is the set of links in _",
    "g_.    a _ path _ @xmath23 between pair of nodes _ i _ and _ j _ refers to the set of links connecting these nodes .",
    "the _ path length _",
    "@xmath24 is the sum of the weights of constituent edges in the path @xmath23 .",
    "the shortest path length @xmath25 is the minimizer of @xmath24 over all @xmath23 .",
    "the _ average shortest path length _ @xmath26 of a network @xmath18 is defined as : @xmath27    where _ n _ is the number of nodes in the graph .",
    "the effective resistance  @xcite @xmath28 between a pair of nodes @xmath6 and @xmath14 is the potential difference between these nodes when a unit current is injected at node @xmath6 and withdrawn at node @xmath14 .",
    "and the effective graph resistance @xmath29 is the sum of the individual effective resistance between each pair of nodes in the network .",
    "computation of the effective graph resistance for a power grid necessitates information about the topology of the grid ( i.e.interconnection of nodes ) , and reactance ( or susceptance  @xcite ) values of the transmission lines in the grid .",
    "the effective graph resistance can be computed in two different ways : ( a ) by aggregating the effective resistances between each pair of nodes , and ( b ) by the eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix of the grid .    the required steps to compute the effective graph resistance based on pairwise effective resistances are ( i ) constructing the laplacian matrix of the grid , ( ii ) determining the generalised inverse of the laplacian matrix , ( iii ) computing effective resistances between each pair of nodes , and ( iv ) summing up the effective resistances .    the laplacian matrix of a power grid @xmath15 reflects the interconnection of buses with transmission lines .",
    "the weight @xmath13 corresponds to the susceptance ( i.e.inverse of reactance ) value between nodes _ i _ and _ j_. the laplacian matrix constructed by the susceptance values is equivalent to the admittance matrix in the electrical power systems theory .    the _ effective resistance _",
    "@xmath28 between any pair of nodes @xmath6 and @xmath14 is computed as : @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the moore - penrose pseudo - inverse of the @xmath15 .    the _ effective graph resistance _",
    "@xmath29 of a power network is then computed by summing up all the effective resistances between all pairs in a network .",
    "@xmath32    another way to compute the effective graph resistance of a power grid requires computation of the eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix of the grid .",
    "this approach requires summing the inverse of the eigenvalues : @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the @xmath35 eigenvalue of the laplacian matrix , and @xmath36 .",
    "this methodology is computationally more efficient , but it does not give any insight into the individual electrical path lengths between pair of buses .",
    "modelling power grid dynamics requires taking the power flow into account . in a dynamic power grid model ,",
    "electric power flows through multiple paths .",
    "this precludes the existence of a distinct path ( and subsequently the existence of the shortest path ) between two nodes in a physical power grid . yet ,",
    "the concept of _ equivalent impedance _ makes it possible to determine a distinct _ electrical path _ between two nodes by conceptually replacing the multiple paths between two nodes with a single equivalent path .",
    "[ fig : eqimpedance ] illustrates the concept .",
    "paths between nodes @xmath8 and @xmath37 with impedances @xmath38 ( on the left hand side ) to a one single conceptual path with an impedance value @xmath39 ( on the right hand side ) . ]",
    "the concept of electrical path length makes it possible to construct the _ electrical topology _ of a power grid .",
    "an electrical topology of a power grid shows the electrical connections / path lengths ( i.e.equivalent impedances ) between buses , rather than the physical connections as a physical topology does . in a power grid ,",
    "the actual `` distance '' between two nodes is the electrical path length , and not the physical distance ( or number of lines ) .",
    "accordingly , the electrical topology of a power grid governs the network dynamics rather than the physical topology .",
    "[ fig : ieee30 ] shows the physical and the electrical topology of the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ( ieee ) 30 buses power system  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : ieee30physical ]   [ fig : ieee30electrical ]    the initial concepts of `` electrical distance '' are discussed by power system researchers  @xcite , and also by mathematicians as _ effective resistance _  @xcite . in a power grid , the effective resistance @xmath28 between buses @xmath6 and @xmath14 equals the equivalent impedance between these buses .",
    "hence , in the electrical topology in fig .",
    "[ fig : ieee30 ] , the connections are the effective conductances ( @xmath40 ) between each pair of nodes .",
    "the _ effective graph resistance _ @xmath29 of a power grid",
    "@xmath18 is an aggregate value of all effective resistances between any pair of nodes in a grid ( see eq .",
    "[ effgraphresistance ] ) .",
    "the existence of parallel paths between two nodes in a physical power grid topology , and a homogeneous distribution of their impedance values result in a smaller effective resistance between these two nodes ( i.e.a stronger connection between these nodes in the electrical topology ) .",
    "the number of parallel paths in the physical topology refers to the number of redundant ( backup ) paths . in case of a failure in one of the paths between two nodes , the power flow carried by the rendered path is distributed over the backup paths .",
    "therefore , a higher number of backup paths implies a more robust network against cascading failures due to line overloads . on the other hand , a relatively more homogeneous distribution of the impedance values results in a relatively more homogeneous distribution of power flow over these parallel paths increasing the robustness of the power grid against cascading failures  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a power grid with a relatively smaller effective graph resistance implies a relatively more robust power grid with respect to cascading failures .",
    "this section verifies the potential of effective graph resistance to anticipate the cascading failures robustness of power networks . experimental verification of the proposed robustness metric requires ( i ) creating synthetic test systems , ( ii ) determining the effective graph resistance of these synthetic test systems ( i.e.theoretical results ) and their robustness levels by simulations ( i.e.experimental results that are considered as the ground truth ) , and ( iii ) quantifying the correlation between the theoretical results and experimental results to assess whether the effective graph resistance anticipates the power grid robustness with respect to cascading failures .",
    "the data required for the metric verification analysis includes the topology of a power grid ( i.e.interconnection of buses with lines ) , reactance values of transmission lines , the types buses and their generation capacity and load values . since the ieee power systems provide all these data , they are considered as the reference systems and additional synthetic test systems are created based on these reference systems .",
    "the synthetic test systems are generated to have exactly the same properties as the reference ieee test system ( e.g.type and number of buses / lines with their interconnection and demand / generation capacity values ) except for the effective graph resistance . in this way , in each test system , all the parameters that have an impact on the robustness ( e.g.topology , generation / loading profile , and loading level ) are fixed , except for the effective graph resistance .",
    "this assures that the difference in the robustness levels of these test systems is due to the change in the effective graph resistance of these grids , and makes possible to assess the impact of the effective graph resistance on the grid robustness .    when creating a new synthetic test system based on the ieee reference system , it is crucial to have a different effective graph resistance and to keep other important aspects for the robustness unchanged .",
    "to achieve this , an arbitrary number of the links of the reference ieee test systems is randomly chosen and the reactance values of these transmission lines are increased .",
    "for example , when creating a synthetic test system based on the ieee 118 power system  @xcite , e.g.4 transmission lines are randomly chosen : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "then the reactance values of these lines ( i.e.@xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) are doubled and a new synthetic test system is created with the new reactance values : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 for lines @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 respectively .",
    "the new synthetic test system has an increased @xmath29 since the effective graph resistance is a monotonic increasing function of the individual reactance values in a network  @xcite .",
    "it also has a different robustness level against cascading failures because the manipulated impedances affect the power flow distribution in the networks  @xcite .",
    "a second synthetic test system is created from the reference ieee 118 power system by increasing the reactance values of the same lines @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 by a factor of three resulting in the impedance values of @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , respectively . in this way , the additional synthetic test systems are created .",
    "the effective graph resistance supposedly quantifies the _ theoretical _ robustness levels of the test systems against cascading failures .",
    "the @xmath29 of the test systems will be compared to the simulation - based robustness levels to assess whether @xmath29 truly anticipates the grid robustness .",
    "the computation of @xmath29 requires data about the admittance matrix of the systems ( i.e.reactance values of the transmission lines and the topology of the grid ) .",

    "@xmath7 metric is used to quantify the robustness of the test systems after the cascades subsides .",
    "this paper uses an attack strategy based on the electrical node significance metric  @xcite .",
    "the electrical node significance is a contextual node centrality measure , specifically designed for power grids . the electrical node significance @xmath58 of a node _",
    "i _ is defined as the amount of power distributed by node _",
    "normalized by the total amount of the power that is distributed in the entire grid :    @xmath59    where @xmath60 stands for total power distributed by node @xmath6 while @xmath61 refers to number of nodes in the network .",
    "this paper attacks a power grid by targeting _ the most heavily loaded outgoing link from the node with the highest electrical node significance _ in the network .",
    "removal of this link most likely results in the largest cascading failure in the power network  @xcite .    assessing the robustness of a power grid against cascading failures by targeted attacks for an interval of tolerance parameters [ @xmath62 , @xmath63 subdivided by @xmath64 ( i.e.a set of tolerance parameters [ @xmath62 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , ... , @xmath63 ) results in the _ robustness curve _ of the grid .",
    "for example , fig .",

    "however , an attack when @xmath57=1.3 ( i.e.@xmath71 results in collapse of the network and only 20% of the total demand can be satisfied .",
    "traditionally , power grid researchers focus on the robustness of a grid for a specific tolerance level of the grid .",
    "however , this paper considers the robustness of a power grid over the whole spectrum of tolerance levels ( i.e.loading levels ) , and defines mathematically the normalized area @xmath72 below the robustness curve as an empirical metric that quantifies the power grid robustness against cascading failures .",

    "because the maximum value of @xmath7 is @xmath67 , @xmath76 refers to the maximum possible area below the robustness curve .",
