    "the discussed 6d hypermultiplets become 4d hypermultiplets . in type  iia on the threefold @xmath137 , the hypermultiplet sector receives corrections in the string coupling @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "however , as we fiberwise apply the 8d type  iia  heterotic duality in the adiabatic limit , the volume of the heterotic @xmath4 is taken to be large .",
    "on the type  iia side this amounts to working in the weak string coupling limit @xmath142 @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the tree level result of the type  iia compactification is a good approximation for the hypermultiplets .",
