    "empirical data collected from the stock market has extremely complicated structure .",
    "apparently , it can seem to be white noise without correlations and with complete disorder , but , by investigating it deeper by means of sophisticated methods , one discovers important non - random features and an amazing hierarchy . amongst these key properties ( the so - called stylized facts )",
    "are the fat tails of p.d.f . of the logarithmic returns , the long range correlations in volatility , the leverage effect and some nontrivial fractal characteristics of data  @xcite .",
    "especially the fractal aspects seem to be particularly important due to their ability to describe complex systems in a relatively simple way . scaling properties , which are fundamental in the fractal formalism , manifest themselves as a linear plot of a given quantity on a log - log scale and",
    "the systems exhibiting such behaviour are called scale - free .",
    "as many real - world signals , the financial data can not be described as a single fractal object but rather as a structure comprising a whole family of interwoven fractals forming a multifractal .",
    "thus , description of this kind of data requires idetifying all of its fractal components .",
    "the multifractal formalism was originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite where the singularity spectrum @xmath0 was introduced as a tool characterizing a multifractal .",
    "this formalism allowed researchers to discover multifractality in almost all fields of science and has gradually become a powerful method quantifying time series coming from biology , physics , economics , technical science and many others @xcite .",
    "having identified the fractal properties of data , the next natural step of the analysis is to simulate a process capable of reproducing these properties under control . as regards the financial world ,",
    "the two following models have been proposed .",
    "the mandelbrot s multifractal model of assets returns ( mmar )  @xcite approximates evolution of the returns with a compound process involving multifractal time and a monofractal fractional brownian motion . in contrast , the multifractal random walk ( mrw )  @xcite can be viewed as a continuous interpolation of a discrete multifractal cascade .",
    "what is particularly important in this context is that multifractal features are not reproduced in such popular models like the family of arch processes .",
    "in our paper we refer only to mmar model and , more specifically , to one of its extensions that we shall call the lux model  @xcite . unlike the static original mmar model , it incorporates an iterative mechanism that mimics effects of the generating cascade for each consecutive point without limiting the length of a signal .",
    "an advantage of this innovation , that looks attractive especially from the perspective of financial engineering , is its forecasting power  @xcite .",
    "we show flexibility of the lux model while an analyzed process changes dynamics .",
    "inspecting the evolution of the model s parameters can help us interpreting the multifractal properties of empirical data .",
    "let us denote the increments of a stationary process @xmath1 by @xcite @xmath2 multifractality of this process can be defined by a non - uniform scaling of the q - order correlation function @xmath3 @xmath4 \\sim \\delta t^{\\tau(q)+1 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath5 denotes the scaling exponent .",
    "if @xmath5 nonlinearly depends on @xmath6 we say that @xmath3 possesses a multifractal character . in a case of linear behaviour of @xmath5",
    "such a process is called monofractal .",
    "an example of the monofractal dynamics is fractional brownian motion which has no correlation ( its classic version ) or is only linearly correlated .",
    "@xmath5 can be related to the singularity spectrum @xmath0 by applying the legendre transformation  @xcite @xmath7 for the brownian motion the singularity spectrum consists of a single point localized at @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the so - called hurst exponent ) and @xmath10 , indicating a strong linear correlation ( positive one for @xmath11 and negative one for @xmath12 ) or no correlation ( @xmath13 ) . for a signal with a multifractal structure the @xmath0 shape resembles an inverted parabola .",
    "the strength of multifractality can be quantified in terms of the @xmath0 curve width @xmath14 the bigger @xmath15 the richer multifractal ( we can also say the more `` convoluted '' fractals ) .",
    "multifractality of a signal can be detected by using one of the modern methods like multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis ( mfdfa )  @xcite or wavelet transform modulus maxima ( wtmm )  @xcite .",
    "here we restrict the analysis to mfdfa which in our opinion gives more reliable results  @xcite .",
    "recent studies show that fluctuation distribution of a market index can not be well approximated by a gaussian  @xcite",
    ". probability density function of the returns is characterized by the so - called fat tails which in most cases obey an inverse cubic power law if expressed as c.d.f .",
    "@xcite . however , in the case of an emerging market we can not _ a priori _ exclude a different behaviour . in the beginning of our study",
    "we first verify if the stock price fluctuations on the warsaw stock exchange ( wse ) obey the same law as larger developed markets .",
    "calculations were carried out on high frequency data of the wse blue chips wig20 index sampled with 1 minute resolution over the period 1999 - 2004 .",
    "all the overnight returns were removed as they are contaminated by some spurious artificial effects .",
    "the wig20 fluctuations are shown in figure [ wig20 fluctuation ] .",
    "what we can easily notice is that after the end of april 2002 the wildest fluctuations seem to be suppressed and the signal becomes `` milder '' .",
    "thus , it is natural to divide our signal into the two following periods and consider them separately : the first one from january 1999 to april 2002 ( 237304 points ) and the second one from may 2002 to december 2004 ( 237268 points ) .",
    "cumulative distributions for both time series are presented in figure [ wig20 distribution ] .",
    "2002/04 ( squares ) and 2002/05@xmath162004/12 ( circles ) confronted against c.d.f.s of a gaussian ( dashed line ) and of a signal generated according to lux model ( dash - dotted line).,scaledwidth=70.0%,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    in average they remain consistent with the inverse power cubic law . for the first period we actually have @xmath17 but only for a very narrow range of plot , while for the second period a larger deviation is visible ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "consistently with the above conclusion from figure [ wig20 fluctuation ] , we see a difference in scaling properties between the periods . from a potential investor s point of view",
    ", an even more important information is stored in temporal correlations of the analyzed signal .",
    "this information can be derived from its multifractal properties that can be a result of both the wide fluctuations distribution and the correlations in higher moments .",
    "it is instructive to calculate the @xmath0 spectra for each year individually and to identify changes in the signal evolution .",
    "the corresponding spectra are shown in figure [ wig20 falfa ] .",
    "the most interesting feature of this figure is that the @xmath0 maxima systematically shift towards lower @xmath19 s : from @xmath20 in 1999 to @xmath21 in 2004 ) , with the exception of 2000 ( dashed line ) , suggesting a gradual transition from a strong persistence ( 1999 ) to a weak antipersistence ( 2004 ) .",
    "almost all the spectra are wide ( @xmath22 ) and can be interpreted as a manifestation of strong multifractality and rich dynamics .",
    "the narrowest curve is for 2004 ( @xmath23 ) so we can regard it as the least interesting one from the multifractal point of view .",
    "according to mmar the logarithmic price @xmath24 is assumed to follow a compound process consisting of a fractional brownian motion @xmath25 and a time @xmath26 : @xmath27 here @xmath28 represents a monofractal process which is a sum of random variables sampled by c.d.f . of a multifractal measure .",
    "both @xmath28 and @xmath26 are independent . a crucial role in the considered process plays the virtual trading time which can be interpreted as a deformation of the homogeneous clock - time or as a local volatility corresponding to faster or slower trading .",
    "the linear correlation of @xmath24 depends on the hurst exponent @xmath9 fully characterizing the brownian motion , whereas the multifractal properties are generated by a multiplicative cascade .",
    "it has to be noted that in the original formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite the whole cascade is generated globally at the same moment for each level @xmath29 .",
    "however , for the sake of prediction we need an iterative procedure that is able to differentiate past and future events .",
    "this is the rationale behind the application of a multiplicative measure proposed by lux  @xcite .",
    "instead of @xmath30 it is better to consider its increments @xmath31 expressed by  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a normalizing factor and @xmath34 is a random multiplier taken from the log - normal distribution in accordance with the formula @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 denotes the conventional normal distribution .",
    "the upper option is taken either with the probability @xmath38 or if for any preceding @xmath39 this option has already been chosen .",
    "otherwise the multiplier remains the same as for previous @xmath40 .",
    "we can imitate in this way the structure of a binary cascade and , on average , preserve its essential features . based on this construction",
    "we see that in order to describe the multifractal properties of such a cascade we need only one parameter @xmath41 .",
    "theoretical multifractal spectrum is then given by @xmath42 this formula implies that @xmath0 is symmetric and has a maximum localized at @xmath43 . under the above formalism",
    "a return can be viewed as a composition of local volatility and white noise  @xcite @xmath44",
    "we try to mimic evolution of wig20 based on the lux extension to mmar and observe how the changes in wig20 dynamics influence the parameter @xmath41 of the model .",
    "this gives us information about the model flexibility and its ability to simulate a highly nonstationary process like the wig20 returns . since fitting the model with a log - normal multiplier distribution requires to estimate only the parameter @xmath41 defining the distribution of eq .",
    "( [ lognormal ] ) , it can be derived by using the relation  @xcite @xmath45 and eq .",
    "( [ log normal cascade falfa ] ) .",
    "first we consider the simplest case of @xmath13 .",
    "the singularity spectrum can be estimated by means of mfdfa with polynomial order 2  @xcite .",
    "figure [ wig20 distribution ] shows c.d.f . of a time series",
    "generated according to the lux model ( dash - dotted line ) .",
    "this distribution has a somewhat thinner tail than the inverse cubic power law , but it is similar to c.d.f . for wig20 from the period 2002/05@xmath162004/12 . in this case",
    "the model appropriately reconstructs the dynamics including large fluctuations .",
    "the evolution of @xmath41 is analyzed by using a moving window of length 20000 data points shifted by 2000 points .",
    "such a window ensures that we obtain statistically reliable results . from figure [ lambda_co_1000 ]",
    "we see that @xmath41 strongly fluctuates over the analyzed period . nevertheless , starting from the end of 2001 it forms a clearly decreasing trend .     calculated in a moving window as a function of time .",
    "open symbols denote position of the first point for each window position.,scaledwidth=80.0%,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    the smallest values of @xmath41 correspond to 2004 and even drop below 1 . in the multifractal formalism @xmath41 refers to the structure complexity ; the larger @xmath41 the more complicated signal and more complex fractal .",
    "it stems from this that from 2002 to 2004 the complexity of the polish stock market gradually decreased despite the existence of some bigger fluctuations .",
    "this result remains in a perfect agreement with the indications of the @xmath0 spectra ( figure [ wig20 falfa ] ) .",
    "although fixing @xmath9 value at 0.5 can give approximate results for shorter signals ( e.g. of length of the window applied before ) , in general it is recommended to treat @xmath9 as a free parameter which has to be estimated from the data because it may influence the forecasted volatility @xcite . to accomplish this task we have to use the relation between @xmath0 spectra for the price and",
    "the time processes ( eq .  ( [ pricetime ] ) ) together with the following condition  @xcite : @xmath46 where @xmath47 stands for the scaling exponent of the price process .",
    "the so - estimated hurst exponent @xmath9 can be used in the calculation of @xmath41 .",
    "results for the windowed wig20 are collected in figure [ lambda_co_1000_i_h ] .",
    "( top ) and parameter @xmath41 ( bottom ) .",
    "open symbols denote position of the first point for each window position.,scaledwidth=80.0%,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    for the first three - year - long interval the hurst exponent indicate persistent behaviour of the index , while starting from 2002 the value of @xmath9 almost monotonically decreases below 0.5 suggesting a transition to the antipersistent regime .",
    "again , this resembles the conclusion made from figure [ wig20 falfa ] but now the evidence is even more convincing . as regards @xmath41",
    ", we see that now its fluctuations are smaller and there is no clear decreasing trend .",
    "therefore , in the present case of variable @xmath9 this quantity absorbs the information about changes in wig20 dynamics .",
    "the study presented in this paper reveals several interesting facts about dynamics of the polish stock market .",
    "first , we see that the wig20 fluctuation magnitude changes in the first half of year 2002 .",
    "this suppression of the largest fluctuations is also visible in c.d.f . of the log - returns .",
    "moreover , we identify this nonstationarity of wig20 in evolution of the parameter @xmath41 of the lux model .",
    "these observations indicates that this model is able to reproduce at least some of the financial data characteristics and to help one with detecting evolution phases with different properties . in the last step",
    "we include in our analysis the empirical estimation of the hurst exponent , a parameter which is necessary for the forecasting purpose . as our results document",
    ", value of this parameter largely determines the multifractal properties of the wig20 evolution , leaving @xmath41 only as an auxilliary measure ."
