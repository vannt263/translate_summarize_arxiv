    "starting from the pioneering work of t hooft @xcite , pure yang  mills theory ( ym ) in the light - cone gauge @xmath7 in two dimensions is considered a free theory , apart perhaps from topological effects .",
    "this feature is at the root of the possibility of calculating the mesonic spectrum in the large-@xmath8 approximation @xcite when dynamical quarks are introduced .",
    "however the theory exhibits severe infrared ( ir ) divergences , which need to be regularized . in ref.@xcite an explicit ir cutoff",
    "is advocated , which turns out to have no influence on the bound state equation ; a cauchy principal value ( cpv ) prescription in handling such ir singularity leads indeed to the same result @xcite . on the other hand",
    "this prescription emerges quite naturally if the theory is quantized at `` equal @xmath9 '' , namely adopting the light - front @xmath10 as quantization surface .",
    "still difficulties in performing a wick s rotation in the dynamical equations was pointed out in ref.@xcite . in order to remedy such a situation , a causal prescription for the double pole in the kernel",
    "was proposed , which is nothing but the one suggested years later by mandelstam and leibbrandt ( ml ) @xcite , when restricted to @xmath11 dimensions .",
    "this prescription follows from equal - time quantization of the theory @xcite .",
    "then a quite different solution for the quark self - energy was obtained , whereas the integral equation for @xmath12 bound states turned out to be very difficult to solve .",
    "an approximate numerical treatment in the massless quark case led to a quite different spectrum @xcite .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached by a recent analytical investigation for different values of the input parameters @xcite .    in view of the above - mentioned controversial results and of the fact that `` pure '' ym theory does not immediately look free in feynman gauge",
    ", a test of gauge invariance was performed in ref.@xcite by calculating at @xmath13 , both in feynman and in light - cone gauge with ml prescription , a rectangular wilson loop with light - like sides , directed along the vectors @xmath14 , @xmath15 and parametrized according to the equations :    @xmath16    this contour has been considered in refs.@xcite for an analogous test of gauge invariance in 1 + 3 dimensions .",
    "its light - like character forces a minkowski treatment .    in order to perform the test ,",
    "dimensional regularization was used ; the feynman option is indeed not viable at strictly 1 + 1 dimensions , as the usual free vector propagator is not a tempered distribution .",
    "the following unexpected results were obtained .",
    "the @xmath17 perturbative loop expression in @xmath18 dimensions is finite in the limit @xmath19 .",
    "the results in the two gauges coincide , as required by gauge invariance .",
    "they exhibit dependence on @xmath4 , the casimir constant of the adjoint representation .",
    "this dependence , when looked at in the light - cone gauge calculation , comes from non - planar diagrams with the colour factor @xmath20 , @xmath0 being the casimir constant of the fundamental representation .",
    "besides , there is a genuine contribution proportional to @xmath21 coming from the one - loop correction to the vector propagator .",
    "this is surprising at first sight , as in strictly 1 + 1 dimensions the triple vector vertex vanishes in axial gauges .",
    "what happens is that transverse degrees of freedom , although coupled with a vanishing strength at @xmath22 , produce finite contributions when matching with the self - energy loop singularity precisely at @xmath22 , eventually producing a finite result .",
    "such a dimensional anomaly - type phenomenon could not appear in a strictly 1 + 1 dimensional calculation , which would only lead to the ( smooth ) non - planar diagram result .",
    "we stress that this `` anomalous '' contribution is essential to get agreement with the feynman gauge calculation , in other words with gauge invariance .",
    "we notice that no ambiguity affects our light - cone gauge results , which do not involve infinities ; in addition the discrepancy can not be accounted for by a simple redefinition of the coupling , that would also , while unjustified on general grounds , turn out to be dependent on the area of the loop .",
    "we are led to the following conclusion : either the theory has a basic discontinuity at @xmath22 or a light - cone gauge wilson loop calculation with the ml prescription in strictly 1 + 1 dimensions , where the triple vector vertex is zero , is at odds with gauge invariance , as the above - mentioned `` anomalous''contribution would be missing .    in order to make the argument complete , we recall that a calculation of the same wilson loop in strictly 1 + 1 dimension in light - cone gauge with cpv prescription for the singularity produces a vanishing contribution from non - planar graphs .",
    "only planar diagrams survive , leading to abelian - like contributions depending only on @xmath0 , which can be resummed to all orders in the perturbative expansion to get the expected exponentiation of the area .",
    "this result , which is the usual one found in the literature , although quite transparent , _ does not coincide _ with the feynman gauge result in the limit @xmath19 .",
    "again we do not see any sensible way to reconcile the two results .",
    "the test can not be generalized to @xmath23 dimensions as cpv prescription leads to inconsistency with power counting in feynman diagrams in this case@xcite .    in order to clarify whether there is indeed a pathology in the light - cone gauge formulation with ml prescription in strictly",
    "1 + 1 dimensions , one can try to study the potential @xmath24 between a  static \" quark  antiquark pair in the fundamental representation , separated by a distance @xmath2 .",
    "then a different wilson loop is to be calculated , _",
    "i.e. _ a rectangular loop with one side along the space direction and one side along the time direction , of length @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively",
    ". eventually the limit @xmath5 is to be considered : the potential @xmath24 between the quark and the antiquark is indeed related to the value of the corresponding wilson loop amplitude @xmath25 through the well - known formula@xcite @xmath26    the crucial point to notice here is that dependence on the casimir constant @xmath4 should cancel at the leading order in any coefficient of a perturbative expansion of the potential with respect to coupling constant .",
    "this criterion has often been used as a check of gauge invariance .",
    "these are just motivation and content of the present paper .    in sect .",
    "ii we recall definitions and general properties of the wilson loop we are going to evaluate .    in sect .",
    "iii we present our results . in the cpv case , due to its essentially abelian nature",
    ", the loop can be exactly evaluated , the so - called area law is recovered , thus providing a linear potential between the quark and the antiquark . in particular full ( abelian - like ) exponentiation in terms of only @xmath0 will occur .",
    "the corresponding calculation in the ml case develops genuine non - abelian terms proportional to @xmath4 ; thus , contrary to the previous case , the loop interaction feels the non - abelian nature of the theory .",
    "higher - order perturbative contributions can not be simply computed ; we limit ourselves to a perturbative @xmath27 calculation , which nevertheless turns out to be sufficient for our purposes",
    ". the result will be that not only does the loop not obey a simple abelian exponentiation , but even the `` area law '' is lost for finite values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in the limit @xmath5 the area law is recovered , but dependence on @xmath4 survives .",
    "our conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "iv and technical details are given in the appendices .",
    "in @xmath11 dimensions , we consider the usual `` gauge fixed '' yang - mills lagrangian , @xmath30 where @xmath31 are lagrange multipliers enforcing the light - cone gauge condition @xmath32 , @xmath33 being a constant ( gauge ) vector . without loss of generality ,",
    "we consider @xmath34 as gauge group , so that the field strength in ( [ lagrangian ] ) is defined as @xmath35 , @xmath36 being the structure constants of @xmath34 . once the gauge condition @xmath37 has been taken into account , the interaction term in the field strength vanishes , so that the theory is manifestly free and the free propagator turns out to be the complete two - point green function . in turn , the prescription for handling the poles of the green function is fixed by the quantization procedure .",
    "equal @xmath9 quantization entails the expression for the free propagator : @xmath38 whereas equal time quantization leads to @xmath39 for the same quantity , with cpv and ml respectively .",
    "we consider the closed path @xmath40 parametrized by the following four segments @xmath41 , @xmath42 describing a ( counterclockwise - oriented ) rectangle centred at the origin of the plane ( @xmath43 ) , with length sides @xmath44 , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "then , for the definition of the wilson loop around @xmath40 we shall adopt the standard one , given by the following vacuum to vacuum amplitude @xmath45    gauge fields in time and @xmath46 orders generators @xmath47 of the gauge group @xmath34 along the closed integration path @xmath40 .",

    "it is easy to show that the perturbative expansion of @xmath53 is an even power series in the coupling constant , so that we can write @xmath54    the fact that we are in strictly 1 + 1 dimensions greatly simplifies the perturbative expansion as the complete green functions are just products of free propagators .    an explicit evaluation of the function @xmath55 in eq .",

    "( [ w4 ] ) , the diagrams with two - gluons exchanges contributing to the order @xmath59 in the perturbative expansion of the wilson loop fall into two distinct classes , depending on the topology of the diagrams :    1 .   _ uncrossed diagrams _ : if the pairs @xmath60 and @xmath61 are contiguous around the loop the two propagators do not cross ( see fig .",

    "we see that the @xmath65 term is present in both types of diagrams and with the same coefficient .",
    "this term is usually denoted `` abelian term '' : were the theory abelian , only such @xmath65 terms would contribute to the loop .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath66 term is present only in crossed diagrams , and is typical of non - abelian theories .",
    "thus , we can decompose @xmath57 as the sum of an abelian and a non - abelian part , @xmath67 moreover , the abelian part is simply half of the square of the order-@xmath68 term , i.e. @xmath69 equation ( [ w4ab ] ) is just a particular case of a more general theorem due to frenkel and taylor @xcite , which proves that the only relevant terms in the perturbative expansion of the loop are the so - called `` maximally non - abelian '' ones ; at @xmath17 those terms are just proportional to @xmath66 . in turn",
    "they only come from crossed diagrams in our case , so that an analysis of just crossed diagrams is enough to get the complete @xmath70 expansion of the wilson loop , once the @xmath71 term is known .",
    "all the abelian terms ( depending only on @xmath0 ) in the perturbative expansion of the wilson loop sum up to reproduce the abelian exponential @xmath72",

    "the remaining symmetry relations ( [ sym ] ) further lower the number to 19 . as a matter of fact , although topologically inequivalent , from eq .",
    "( [ sym ] ) it is easy to get @xmath98 which are the 16 relations needed to lower the number of diagrams to be evaluated from 35 to 19 . besides the 32 diagrams quoted in eq .",
    "( [ relations ] ) , there are three other crossed diagrams that do not possess any apparent symmetry relation with other diagrams : @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( see fig . [ fig4 ] ) , so that the number of topologically inequivalent crossed diagrams is indeed 35 .",
    "the calculation of the 19 independent diagrams needed is lengthy and not trivial .",
    "the details of such calculation are fully reported in the appendix b. each diagram depends not only on the area @xmath80 of the loop , but also on the dimensionless ratio @xmath101 through complicated functions involving powers , logarithms and dilogarithm functions , denoted by @xmath102 .",
    "since we shall be interested in the large-@xmath28 behaviour , we have always considered the region @xmath103 , and in the final result we have performed all the analytical continuations of the dilogarithm in such a way that the point @xmath104 corresponds to the vanishing argument of @xmath102 , in order to have easily expandible expressions ( see appendix b for details ) .    adding all the contributions as in eq .",

    "the result ( [ wmlg4 ] ) does not depend only on the area @xmath106 of the loop , but also on the ratio @xmath107 .",
    "it is remarkable , and perhaps not incidental , that for @xmath108 ( large @xmath28 ) a pure area dependence is recovered , i.e. @xmath109 nevertheless , since the above limit does not vanish , even at large @xmath28 @xmath110 fails to have an abelian exponential behavior .",
    "a little thought is enough to realize that , also in the large-@xmath28 limit , the perturbative series @xmath111 can not sum to a _ phase factor _ , even taking into account possible extra non - abelian terms in the argument of the exponent . as a matter of fact , following @xcite , from ( [ limit ] ) and ( [ mlo2 ] ) one concludes that @xmath112    as the calculation @xmath17 is really very heavy , we have performed a consistency check of its accuracy .",
    "we have indeed independently computed the contribution from _ uncrossed _ graphs @xmath17 ( which only involve @xmath65 ) and then we have summed it to the expression for the corresponding @xmath65 from the _ crossed _ graphs , which has twice the weight in eq .",

    "the persistence of the dependence on @xmath4 in the leading coefficient of the @xmath17 expansion of a wilson loop at large @xmath28 has always been interpreted as a pathology @xcite .",

    ", besides violating causality and being extremely cumbersome , would not be reliable .",
    "it is indeed well known that already the gluon self - energy at @xmath71 , obtained by this regularization , is inconsistent since it exhibits peculiar singularities which do not find cancellation in the corresponding scalar and spinor contributions in susy n=4 @xcite .",

    "but , for planar diagrams , the only difference between the two cases is the appearance in the latter of the casimir constant @xmath0 .",

    "as already explained in the main text , we can restrict ourselves to the maximally non - abelian diagrams , namely those providing a @xmath66 factor .",
    "such diagrams are those in which the position of the propagators is crossed , and there are 35 topologically inequivalent diagrams of this type .",
    "however , thanks to the symmetry relations ( [ sym ] ) , the number of independent diagrams to be evaluated is 19 ( see eq .",
    "( [ relations ] ) ) .",
    "we first need the @xmath140 functions defined in eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) that are appropriate to the present case : substituting the parametrization of the path ( [ path ] ) and the propagator in the causal formulation ( [ propml ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) , we can derive all the functions @xmath140 .",
    "they are given by @xmath141 where , @xmath107 and the symmetry relations ( [ sym ] ) have been taken into account .",
    "the position ( and the appearance ) of poles in the above functions clearly depends on the magnitude of @xmath124 .",
    "being interested in the large-@xmath28 limit , we shall always consider the domain @xmath142 .",
    "consequently , the functions @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 do not present poles : this is the reason why in eq .",
    "( [ eml ] ) we omitted the prescription for those functions as irrelevant [ to this purpose , remember that @xmath146 $ ] , see eq .",
    "( [ path ] ) ] .",
    "the diagrams @xmath92 are then defined in eq .",
    "( [ doppi ] ) as multiple integrals of functions @xmath147 .",
    "the notation is such that @xmath92 denotes the diagram with two _ crossed _",
    "propagators , the first joining the segments @xmath148 and the second joining the segments @xmath149 .",
    "once one diagram @xmath92 is evaluated , its value has to be multiplied by a factor 8 , which is the number of permutations of the indices @xmath150 that maintains the position of the two propagators crossed : this is a consequence of the first equation in ( [ sym ] ) .",
    "more explicitly , this means @xmath151 to preserve crossing , the integration extrema have to be carefully chosen , and the integration variables @xmath152 have to be suitably nested .",
    "just as an example , in the diagram @xmath153 the integration variables have to be such that @xmath154 ( see fig . [ fig3 ] ) .",

    "the corresponding diagrams will obviously rescale by a factor @xmath161 , and will be denoted by @xmath162 , namely @xmath163 .",
