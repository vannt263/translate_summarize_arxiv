    "one of the challenges in neutrino physics is to explain the pattern of neutrino masses and mixings which are deduced from the current neutrino data .",
    "presently accepted values of the mixing angles are @xmath5 @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that the symmetries of the lagrangian predict the elements of mns matrix to be simple fractions . in a well - known scenario called bi - maximal mixing @xcite ,",
    "the mixing angles are predicted to be @xmath8 @xmath9 and @xmath10 additional effects can modify the above predictions and lead to values of mixing angles close to experimentally determined values .",
    "for example , it is well - known that renormalization group evolution from gut scale to electroweak scale can substantially change the value of @xmath3 @xcite . the neutrino mass matrix is assumed to be generated by the see saw mechanism @xcite . here",
    "we will assume that the dominant part of neutrino mass matrix arises due to gut scale operators and they lead to bi - maximal mixing .",
    "this matrix can receive corrections due to physics from higher scale .",
    "the gravitational interaction of neutrinos with the standard model higgs field can be expressed as an effective @xmath0 invariant dimension-5 operator @xcite , @xmath11 here and everywhere below we use greek indices @xmath12 .. for the flavour states and latin indices i , j , k for the mass states . in the above equation @xmath13",
    "is the lepton doublet  , @xmath14 is the higgs doublet and @xmath15 is the planck mass .",
    "@xmath16is a @xmath17 matrix in flavour space with each element o(1 ) . in eq(1 ) , all indices are explicitly shown .",
    "the lorentz indices a , b = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 are contracted with the charge conjugation matrix c and the su(2)l isospin indices a , b , c , d = 1 , 2 are contracted with @xmath18 the levi - civita symbol in two dimensions . after spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking the lagrangian in eq(1 ) generates additional terms to the neutrino mass matrix @xmath19 where @xmath20=174 gev is the vev of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "we assume that gravitational interaction is `` flavour blind '' , that is @xmath21 is independent of @xmath22  indices .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption because gauge invariance requires gravity to couple to the spin of a particle and these couplings are independent of the global @xmath23 charges of the particle .",
    "thus the planck scale contribution to the neutrino mass matrix is @xmath24 where the scale @xmath25  is @xmath26 in our calculation , we take eq(3 ) as a perturbation to the main part of the neutrino mass matrix that is generated by gut dynamics .",
    "we compute the changes in neutrino mass eigenvalues and mixing angles induced by this perturbation .",
    "we assume that gut scale operators give rise to the light neutrino mass matrix , which in the mass eigenbasis , takes the form @xmath27 @xmath28@xmath29 , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 are real and non negative .",
    "we take these to be the unperturbed ( @xmath32  masses .",
    "let @xmath33 be the neutrino mixing matrix at @xmath34 .",
    "then the corresponding @xmath34 mass matrix @xmath35 in flavour space is given by @xmath36    the @xmath34 mns matrix @xmath33 has the form @xmath37@xmath38 where the nine elements are , in general , functions of three mixing angles and six phases . in terms of the above elements ,",
    "the mixing angles are defined by @xmath39 the matrix @xmath40 contains the dirac phase @xmath41 this phase leads to cp violation in neutrino oscillations . @xmath42 and @xmath43  are the so called majorana phases , which affect the neutrinoless double beta decay . @xmath44 and",
    "@xmath45  are usually absorbed as a part of the definition of the charged lepton field .",
    "it is possible to rotate these phases away , if the mass matrix in eq(5 ) is the complete mass matrix .",
    "however , since we are going to add another contribution to this mass matrix , these phases of the zeroth order mass matrix can have an impact on the complete mass matrix and thus must be retained . by the same token , the majorana phases which are usually redundant for oscillations have a dynamical role to play now .",
    "planck scale effects will add other contributions to the mass matrix . including the planck scale mass terms ,",
    "the mass matrix in flavour space is modified as @xmath46 with @xmath47 being a matrix whose elements are all 1 as discussed in eq(3 ) . since @xmath25 is small",
    ", we treat the second term ( arising from the planck scale effects ) in the above equation as a perturbation to the first term ( the gut scale mass terms ) .",
    "this perturbation formalism was first developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we briefly recall the main features for completeness .",
    "the matrix relevant for oscillation physics is the following hermitian matrix @xmath48 to the first order in the small parameter @xmath25 , the above matrix is @xmath49 this hermitian matrix is diagonalized by a new unitary matrix @xmath50 the corresponding diagonal matrix @xmath51 correct to first order in @xmath25 , is related to the above matrix by @xmath52 rewriting @xmath35 in the above expression in terms of the diagonal matrix @xmath53 we get @xmath54 where @xmath55 here @xmath53 and @xmath56 are the diagonal matrices with neutrino masses correct to @xmath57and @xmath58order in @xmath25 .",
    "it is clear from eq(14 ) that the new mixing matrix can be written as : @xmath59 where @xmath60  is a hermitian matrix that is first order in @xmath61 oscillation physics is unchanged under the transformation @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is a diagonal phase matrix .",
    "we can use this invariance to set the diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath60 to be zero .    from eq(14 )",
    "we obtain @xmath64.\\ ] ] therefore to first order in @xmath25 ,  the mass squared difference @xmath65  get modified as @xmath66-m_{j}re[m_{jj}]).\\ ] ] the change in the elements of the mixing matrix , which we parametrized by @xmath60 , is given by @xmath67 the above equation determines only the off diagonal elements of matrix @xmath68 . as mentioned above ,",
    "the diagonal elements can be set to zero without loss of generality .",
    "the expressions for @xmath69 in eq(18 ) and for @xmath68 in eq(19 ) were first obtained in ref @xcite . from the above equation , we see that  @xmath68 are proportional to the neutrino masses .",
    "thus they are larger for the case of degenerate neutrinos . here",
    "onwards we assume degenerate neutrino masses .",
    "then expression for @xmath68 simplifies to @xmath70 in obtaining the above equation , we made the approximation @xmath71 this is valid because the @xmath72  term in the numerator is already proportional to @xmath25 and we are working to @xmath73 order in @xmath25 . for degenerate neutrinos , @xmath74 thus the expression for @xmath68 further simplifies to @xmath75    to obtain the largest effect possible , we assume the largest allowed value of 2 ev for degenerate neutrino mass which comes from tritium beta decay @xcite .",
    "we also assume normal neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "thus we have @xmath762 ev , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "if all elements of @xmath47  consist of 1 then @xmath79  where three complex numbers @xmath80 are defined by @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 as in the case of @xmath84order mixing angles , we can define @xmath73 order mixing angles in terms of @xmath73 order mixing matrix elements in a manner similar to eq(19 ) @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 from eq(16 ) , we get @xmath88 substituting the expressions for @xmath68 from eq(21 ) ( and @xmath89 ) in the above equation , we obtain @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94    for degenerate neutrinos , @xmath95 because @xmath96 thus , from the above set of equations , we see that @xmath97 and @xmath98 are much larger than @xmath99@xmath100 and @xmath101",
    ". hence we can expect much larger change in @xmath3 compared to @xmath102 and @xmath2 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we expect the mixing angles coming from gut scale operators to be determined by some symmetries . we assume these symmetries give riso to a bi - maximal mixing pattern , @xmath103 and @xmath104 . using eq(25 ) to eq(27 ) , we compute the modified mixing angles for the degenerate neutrino mass of 2 ev .",
    "we have taken @xmath105 @xcite and @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "for simplicity , we have set the charged lepton phases @xmath107 . since we have set @xmath104 , the dirac phase @xmath37 drops out of the @xmath84 order mixing matrix . from eq(22 ) to eq(24 ) we see that the complex numbers @xmath108  @xmath109  and @xmath110 are independent of @xmath37 and hence all deviations in @xmath111 are independent of @xmath37 .",
    "the complex nature of @xmath108  @xmath112and @xmath110 comes from the majorana phases @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which we take to be non - zero .",
    "we compute the modified mixing angles as function of @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in table 1 , we list the modified neutrino mixing angles for some sample values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 . as shown in the table , the deviation in @xmath102 and @xmath2 is negligibly small whereas the deviation in @xmath3 is significant . in fig(1 ) , we show contours of constant deviation , @xmath113 ,  vs @xmath42  and @xmath43 .          from fig(1 )",
    ", we see that planck scale effects reduce @xmath3 from the bi - maximal value of @xmath114 to about @xmath115 this is the present 3@xmath116 upper limit of the solar mixing angle .",
    "thus we see that planck scale effects can bring down bi - maximal @xmath3 to within experimentally acceptable range . in our discussion above , we have not included the renormalization group running .",
    "the matrix in eq(3 ) arises at planck scale .",
    "its renormalization group running from @xmath117 to @xmath118 is negligible .",
    "thus , at @xmath118 , the total interaction matrix , that eventually gives rise to neutrino mass matrix on electroweak symmetry breaking , is the sum of gut scale matrix and the planck scale matrix .",
    "renormalization group running modfies these couplings from their gut values to low energy values @xcite",
    ". this can lead to lower values of @xmath119 , much closer to the experimental best fit value .",
    "recently various authors considered tri - bi - maximal mixing scenario which predicts @xmath120 or @xmath121 in order to obtain a value close to the best fit value @xcite .",
    "we computed the modified mixing angles for this scenario also , that is for the input values @xmath121@xmath9and @xmath10 neutrino masses are kept to be the same as in the previous case .",
    "the modified mixing angles are shown in table ( 2 ) . in fig",
    "( 2 ) the deviation of @xmath3is plotted as a function of @xmath42  and @xmath122 we see that deviation in @xmath3 is about @xmath123 .",
    "the range of @xmath3 given by this deviation spans @xmath124 range of solar neutrino mixing angle .",
    ".the modified mixing angles for various values of phases .",
    "input values are @xmath105 ,  @xmath106 , @xmath125 ,  @xmath9 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "it is expected that symmetries at gut scale will determine the neutrino mixings .",
    "bi - maximal mixing is one of the attractive theoretical ideas proposed in this context .",
    "however , the solar neutrino data show that the mixing angle @xmath3 is substantially less than @xmath126 . in this paper",
    ", we studied how neutrino mass terms arising from planck scale effects modify the bi - maximal mixing scenario .",
    "we consider these additional mass terms to be perturbation to the main neutrino mass matrix coming from gut scale and computed the first order corrections to neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "the changes in all three mixing angles are proportional to the neutrino mass eigenvalues . to maximise the change we assumed degenerate neutrino masses @xmath127  ev .",
    "for degenerate neutrino masses , the changes in @xmath102  and @xmath128are inversely proportional to @xmath129 and @xmath130 respectively , whereas the change in @xmath3 is inversely proportional to @xmath131 . since @xmath132 the change in @xmath3 is much larger than the changes in @xmath1and @xmath2 .",
    "the actual magnitude of change also depends on the majorana phases @xmath42 and @xmath43 but is independent of dirac phase @xmath37 , because we assumed that @xmath102 at @xmath84 order is zero . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the change in @xmath102 , due to this perturbation , is small . here",
    "we show that the change in @xmath2 also is small ( less than @xmath133 but the change in @xmath134can be substantial ( about @xmath135 . if @xmath134at @xmath84 order is @xmath136 the change induced by the planck scale terms can bring it down to @xmath137 which is the @xmath138 upper limit of the solar mixing angle .",
