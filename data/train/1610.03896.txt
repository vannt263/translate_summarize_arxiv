    "in contrast , when the transversals to @xmath11 are _ totally disconnected _ , and we then say that @xmath8 is a matchbox manifold , the development of a molino theory in @xcite does not address several key issues , which can be seen as the result of using techniques developed for the smooth theory in the context of totally disconnected spaces . in this work , we apply a completely different approach to developing a topological molino theory for the case of totally disconnected transversals .",
    "the techniques we use were developed in the authors works @xcite .",

    "then @xmath1194 .",
    "we next show that the normal core , @xmath1195 , of @xmath1196 in @xmath43 is a finite subgroup , and then apply corollary  [ cor - anydisc ] to conclude that the discriminant of the action defined by the group chain @xmath1197 is a non - trivial cantor group .",
    "the following argument is similar to that used in the proof of theorem  [ thm - tamecantor ] , and uses that the alternating group @xmath1156 is simple for @xmath1155 , and has order @xmath1157 .",
    "let @xmath1198 be the order of the finite group .",
    "the for all @xmath1202 , the factor @xmath1203 in the product in is contained in the kernel of the projection @xmath1204 , and thus , @xmath1205 .",
    "consequently , we have that @xmath1206 in particular , this shows that @xmath1207 contains a non - trivial cantor group .",
    "moreover , by applying lemma  [ lem - altcore ] to each factor of the product in @xmath1208 , we see that @xmath1208 has trivial core in @xmath326 as well .",
    "thus , we have @xmath1209 and so is a finite normal subgroup of @xmath43 .    by corollary  [ cor - anydisc ]",
    ", the quotient group chain @xmath1210 has non - trivial discriminant group @xmath1211 which contains a subgroup isomorphic to the non - trivial cantor group @xmath1208 . for @xmath338 , apply this to the case @xmath1020 to obtain that the quotient chain @xmath1212 is not equivalent to a normal chain .",
    "now suppose that the restricted group chain @xmath1213 is equivalent to a normal chain , then as @xmath1214 is a normal subgroup of @xmath326 , this implies that the quotient group chain @xmath1212 is equivalent to a normal chain , hence has trivial discriminant , which is a contradiction .",
    "thus , the group chain @xmath1182 is not virtually regular .",
    "[ prob - lubotzky ] given a separable profinite group @xmath1215 and an embedding into a profinite group @xmath451 with trivial rational core , constructed using the methods of @xcite , give criteria for when the resulting equicontinuous minimal cantor system @xmath994 is weakly normal , and whether the action is tame or wild .",
    "furthermore , when do the resulting actions satisfy the _ sqa _ condition of section  [ subsec - defsqa ] ?",
    "there is also an extensive literature for the construction of embeddings of groups @xmath133 into the profinite completions of torsion - free , finitely generated nilpotent and solvable groups .",
    "for example , the work @xcite shows that if @xmath54 is a finitely - generated , torsion - free nilpotent group , then the profinite completion @xmath451 is torsion free , so if @xmath1216 is a closed subgroup , then it must be a cantor group .    on the other hand , the works @xcite shows that there exists a countable , torsion - free , residually finite , metabelian group @xmath54 such that its profinite completion contains a non - trivial torsion subgroup .",
    "the work @xcite studies the profinite topology of nilpotent groups of class two and finitely generated centre - by - metabelian groups , and uses this to construct embeddings of finite groups into the profinite completions of these classes of groups .",
    "however , the embedding obtained in @xcite is contained in the center of @xmath54 , so does not satisfy the trivial core condition .",
    "we conclude with an open question , suggested by the examples and results of the works @xcite ."
