    "the analytic formalism can be generalized to higher charge calorons ( @xmath15 ) , although explicit results are harder to get at . in this section",
    "we report on work by three of us ( fb , dn and pvb )  @xcite .    periodically repeating @xmath16 instantons ( up to a colour rotation with @xmath17 ) within each time - layer @xmath18 $ ] , using @xmath19 as a fourier index , maps the appropriate adhm data  @xcite to a self - dual @xmath20 gauge field @xmath21 .",

    "when @xmath24 is constant for @xmath25 $ ] ( always true for @xmath26 ) , its eigenvalues are directly related to the constituent locations , all of the same type with a mass @xmath27 .",
    "the motivation for these studies has been to understand to which degree the monopole constituents can be seen ( outside their non - abelian cores ) as    independent point - like dirac monopoles .",
    "approximate superpositions of calorons , e.g. using the sum ansatz  @xcite , suffer from subtle effects that lead to finite energy remnants of the dirac string as illustrated in fig .  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "fortunately this is an artefact of the approximation , as can be seen from a class of exact axially symmetric solutions , for which @xmath24 is piecewise constant .",
    "it does , however , make model building on the basis of these constituent monopoles intricate .",
    "in the high temperature limit the non - abelian cores of the monopoles shrink to zero size . as long as @xmath28 the mass of the fermions becomes infinite in this limit and the zero - modes are entirely localized to the non - abelian cores of the constituent monopoles , cmp .",

    "is given by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the green s function of the adhm - nahm construction and can be computed using impurity scattering methods .",
    "many simplifications occur in the high temperature limit , where the density for @xmath11 can be written as @xmath31 .",
    "this function can therefore be used to trace the possible extended nature of constituent monopole sources ( independence of @xmath14 implies it is a highly non - trivial conserved quantity of the nahm equations ) . for su(2 ) and @xmath32 we found _",
    "m(x)=+_r<-5 mm drd , where @xmath33 , up to an    arbitrary coordinate shift and rotation , in terms of a scale @xmath34 and shape parameter @xmath35 to characterize _ arbitrary _",
    "su(2 ) charge 2 solutions of @xmath24 .",
    "this represents an extended structure with the core restricted to a disk bounded by an ellipse with minor axes @xmath36 and major axes @xmath37 .",
    "but for large @xmath34 this can be shown to approach two point - like monopoles ( @xmath38 ) separated by @xmath37 .",
    "axially symmetric solutions are always point - like ( @xmath39 ) , with unlike - charges alternating .",
    "we return to interpreting the recent lattice data of ref .",
    "@xcite , based on using the fermion zero - modes as a filter , restricting to q=1 by insisting there is only one `` exact '' zero - mode . in the confined phase a reasonable fraction of configurations was found with one lump in the zero - mode density , but at different locations as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "this fitted well the expected behaviour of a charge one su(3 ) caloron , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "there will typically be near zero - modes as well , revealing the presence of q anti- and q+1 instantons . to rule out that the zero - mode could be hopping between the q+1 instantons , rather than between the constituent monopoles of a single caloron , two of us ( mgp and pvb ) computed the mixing of zero - modes as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "for simplicity we consider su(2 ) , adding a charge 1 anti - instanton and a charge 2 instanton in the algebraic gauge with ( the same ) arbitrary holonomy , i.e. using the sum ansatz  @xcite . in isolation",
    "the charge 2 instanton has two exact zero - modes , and only one of them can survive : the one associated to the zero ( left ) eigenvector of the 2x1 overlap matrix  @xcite ( using weyl fermions ) o_ia^ij(z)=&d^4x^(i)_(i)(x;z)^_d_^(j)_(a)(x;z ) + = & -d^4x^(i)_(i ) ( x;z)^__^(j)_(a)(x;z ) , where @xmath40 and the equation of motion for the zero - modes was used .",
    "we now assume that the charge 2 instanton is made up of two sufficiently separated instantons , in which case @xmath41 to a good approximation is equal to the charge 1 zero - mode associated with the @xmath42 instanton .",
    "the exact form of the su(2 ) q=1 zero - mode with @xmath43 has been given before  @xcite .",
    "the anti - instanton and its zero - mode are obtained by time reversal , which changes the periodicity to @xmath44 , to be corrected by a gauge rotation @xmath45 and changing the sign of @xmath14 .",
    "this ensures the overlap integral is periodic . in terms of the scale parameter @xmath46 ( determining the distance @xmath47 between the constituents ) , arbitrary location @xmath48 and orientation @xmath49 ( with @xmath50 su(2 ) the associated spin rotation )",
    ", we find -1mm&&-6 mm o_ia(z)=- d^4x(k(z)+k^*(-z ) ) , + & & -6 mm k(z)_(i)^(x^(i);z)u^_(i ) _ _ u_(a)_(a)(x^(a);z),where , @xmath51 and & & -5mm_(i)(x;z)_(i)^(x)f^(i)_x(,z ) , + & & -5mm_(a)(x;z)_(a)^(x)f^(a)_x(,z ) .",
    "-1mmexplicit expressions for @xmath52 and @xmath53 can be found elsewhere  @xcite .    for generic values of the parameters the overlap is complex and to go through zero ( to maximize localization )",
    "requires fine - tuning of two parameters .",
    "we will assume here that , for each of the two instantons and the anti - instanton , both constituent monopoles are approximately at the same location ( @xmath47 small ) . typically then",
    ", if one instanton is sufficiently further away from the anti - instanton their overlap will be exponentially small and the zero mode will localize on that instanton .",
    "this happens generically for any @xmath14 except for two small intervals ( proportional to @xmath54 ) around @xmath55 where the ( anti-)instanton zero mode becomes delocalized and the overlap is not guaranteed to be small .",
    "one could , in principle , observe in these two intervals a significant mixing with the zero mode of the second instanton .",
    "notice however that , except for trivial holonomy where the two intervals merge into one ( at @xmath56 or @xmath57 ) , this effect leads to double the expected number of hoppings .",
    "therefore it could only possibly mimic the behaviour of a _ single _ caloron with trivial holonomy .",
    "we can then conclude that the full signature of a single su(2 ) caloron with _ non - trivial _ holonomy is unlikely to be emulated by the effect of hopping between two instantons , and we expect the same to hold for su(3 ) .",
    "cooling studies at a low temperature , rather than just below the deconfinement temperature , have been reported as well  @xcite .",
    "constituents at non - trivial holonomy could still be identified by points where two eigenvalues of the polyakov loop coincide , but they revealed no individual lumps .",
    "this may explain why before no constituents were found .",
    "it is also interesting to point out that for @xmath58 the scale parameter plays an entirely different role and the measure for integration over the moduli space should be formulated in terms of constituent monopoles of fixed size ( at fixed temperature ) .",
    "this should remove the infrared divergence of the scale integration , although it is unlikely a semiclassical picture can be used here .",
