    "but , what is forcing the ions , atoms and molecules of the stellar atmospheric plasma to behave this way ? as we shall see below , the atomic polarization is the result of a transfer process of `` order '' from the radiation field to the atomic system .",
    "it is thus natural that the logical structure of this review article is as follows : quantification of the `` order '' of the radiation field ( section 3 ) , quantification of the `` order '' of the atomic system ( section 4 ) and transfer of `` order '' from the radiation field to the atomic system ( section 5 ) .",

    "the story began in 1923 when wilhelm hanle of gttingen university published the first correct interpretation of a previously observed phenomenon related to the effect of a weak magnetic field on the _ linear _ polarization of the spectral - line radiation scattered by mercury vapor illuminated _ anisotropically _ ( see hanle 1923 ; 1924 ) .",
    "with respect to the linear polarization corresponding to the zero magnetic field case , the observed influence of a weak magnetic field ( of the order of 1 gauss ) was a _",

    "the hanle effect is directly related to the generation of coherent superposition of degenerate zeeman sublevels of an atom ( or molecule ) by a light beam . as the zeeman sublevels are split by the magnetic field , the degeneracy is lifted and the coherence ( and , in general , also the population imbalances among the sublevels ) are modified . as we shall illustrate below in the context of the solar polarized spectrum , this gives rise to a characteristic magnetic - field dependence of the linear polarization of the scattered light that is finding increasing application as a diagnostic tool for magnetic fields in astrophysics ( see _ astrophysical spectropolarimetry _",

    "1 that there is _ no _ magnetic field ( i.e. there is no lorentz force influencing the motion of the oscillating electron ) . under these circumstances",

    "only the @xmath10 and @xmath11 oscillators are excited by the incident beam .",
    "the two excited oscillators radiate _ independently _ and decay radiatively with a damping constant @xmath12 .",
    "if we observe along the direction of the incident beam ( forward scattering case ) we find that the radiation is obviously unpolarized .",

    "note that the same conclusion is obviously reached if the vibration of the @xmath10-oscillator is considered as that resulting from the _ coherent superposition _ of two counter - rotating circular oscillators , which are oscillating in phase with respect to each other at frequency @xmath3 in the @xmath10@xmath17@xmath18 plane .",
    "consider now the observations of the `` south solar pole '' , where we have assumed in fig .",
    "1 the presence of a weak magnetic field _ parallel _ to the solar surface and orientated along the @xmath11-axis .",
    "we have now to take into account the influence of the lorentz force on the motion of the bound electron .",
    "the result is that the atom can not be interpreted as three independent linear oscillators , but as a linear oscillator parallel to the magnetic field and two counter - rotating circular oscillators in the @xmath10@xmath17@xmath18 plane oscillating at angular frequencies @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the larmor angular frequency ( with @xmath22 indicating that the magnetic field is to be given in gauss ) .",

    "is seen pole - on and , therefore , the observed polarization simply reflects the weighted average of the above - mentioned `` rosette '' pattern . with respect to the previous _ unmagnetized _ `` north - pole case '' , we now get ( for observation at the limb ) a _ depolarization _ and a _ rotation _ of the polarization plane ( i.e. we now have a _ smaller _ stokes @xmath14 value and a _ non - zero _ stokes @xmath34 signal ) .",
    "this rotation is _ counterclockwise _ for a magnetic field pointing toward the observer , as in fig . 1 , but _",

    "1 ) a net linear polarization signal along the @xmath11-axis , but of smaller amplitude than that corresponding to the previous @xmath27 forward - scattering case .    finally , it is also of interest to consider the `` south pole '' magnetized case , but assuming that the weak magnetic field is now orientated along the @xmath10-axis .",
    "it is easy to understand that all remains unchanged with regard to the forward scattering case ( with the exception that now the observed linear polarization is along the @xmath10-axis , i.e. again along the magnetic field direction ) .",
    "however , for the limb observation we would only see the depolarization effect ( i.e. a stokes @xmath14 signal decreasing with the magnetic field , but @xmath16 always ) .",
    "moreover , the stokes @xmath14 signal does _ not _ vanish completely once the magnetic field becomes sufficiently large so as to have @xmath35 .",
    "figure 2 corresponds to the situation of a magnetic field which is always orientated along the @xmath10-axis . note that a magnetic field parallel to the solar surface and with an intensity in the saturated regime ( i.e. @xmath35 or @xmath36 ) leads to a linear polarization amplitude for disc - centre observations that is an order of magnitude _ smaller _ than that corresponding to the unmagnetized reference case ( @xmath37 ) for an observation close to the solar limb ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "given the weakness of the `` predicted '' disc - centre polarization signals , two spectral lines of possible interest for a disc - centre hanle - effect observational search of horizontal chromospheric fields would be the ca i 4227 @xmath39 line and the d@xmath40 line of ba ii at 4554 @xmath39 .",
    "[ hanle2 ]      as we have seen , the hanle effect produces a modification of the _ linear _ polarization signals ( quantified by the stokes @xmath14 and @xmath34 parameters ) with respect to the reference case of non - magnetic scattering polarization .",
    "this occurs in a parameter domain in which the _ transverse _ zeeman effect is practically ineffective .",
    "the hanle effect is sensitive to magnetic fields such that the corresponding zeeman splitting is comparable to the inverse lifetime of the lower or the upper atomic levels involved in the line transition under consideration . the basic approximate formula to estimate the _ maximum _ magnetic field intensity @xmath41 ( measured in gauss ) to which the hanle effect can be sensitive is .",

    ", we may find different hanle - effect regimes .",
    "the most familiar one to astrophysicists in general is the `` upper - level hanle effect '' , in which only the upper - level coherences are modified by the action of the magnetic field .",
    "however , we may also have a `` lower - level hanle effect '' regime in which only the lower - level coherences are sensitive to the field .",
    "the most general hanle - effect takes place when the magnetic field affects the coherences of both levels simultaneously .",
    "obviously , this dichotomy between an upper - level and a lower - level hanle effect is only a suitable one if there exists a sizeable difference in the lifetimes of the lower and upper levels of the particular radiative transition .",
    "it certainly holds for solar spectral lines whose lower level is either the _ ground _ or a _ metastable _ level , as happens , for example , with the d - lines of na i ( landi deglinnocenti 1998 ) or with the mg i @xmath44 lines ( trujillo bueno 1999 ) .",
    "it is important to note that in the solar atmosphere ( whose @xmath45 k ) the lifetime of a ground or metastable level is typically two orders of magnitude _ larger _ than the lifetime of the upper level .",
    "therefore , for typical solar spectral lines the upper - level hanle effect would be sensitive to magnetic fields of between 1 and 100 gauss , while the lower - level hanle effect could in principle be used for diagnosing much weaker fields , i.e. fields between @xmath0 and 1 gauss . whether or not sub - gauss magnetic fields can actually exist in the highly conductive solar plasma is a question that most solar plasma physicists are inclined to answer negatively . the main result",
    "i aim at demonstrating in this article is that the `` enigmatic '' linear polarization signals observed by stenflo _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) close to the solar limb in a number of chromospheric lines are undoubtedly due to the presence of _ atomic polarization _ in their _ metastable - level _ lower - levels .",

    "( 2001 ) using different polarimeters attached to the canary islands solar telescopes .",
    "how such metastable - level atomic polarization can survive in the solar chromosphere is certainly a challenging question that i will also address in this paper . in particular",
    ", i will discuss briefly how a rigorous theoretical interpretation of this type of spectropolarimetric observations is giving us decisive new clues about the topology and intensity of the magnetic field of the `` quiet '' solar chromosphere .",
    "[ hanle3 ]      before entering into details it is convenient to recall that the zeeman effect is most sensitive in _ circular _ polarization ( quantified by the stokes @xmath46 parameter ) , with a magnitude that scales with the ratio between the zeeman splitting and the width of the spectral line , and in a way such that the @xmath46 profile changes its sign for opposite orientations of the magnetic field vector .",
    "the longitudinal zeeman effect in typical solar fraunhofer lines is of course rather insensitive to sub - gauss magnetic fields .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that today s state - of - the - art polarimeters are perfectly able to detect stokes @xmath46 signals corresponding to a flux density of only a few gauss ( see , e.g. , snchez almeida and lites , 2000 ) . thus , unless this flux density is well below 1 gauss in the spatio - temporal resolution element of the observations , the longitudinal zeeman effect itself should be considered of complementary diagnostic value to the hanle effect . in any case , it is important to emphasize that the hanle effect , contrary to the zeeman effect , does indeed work in any topologically complex weak - field scenario ( i.e. even if the net magnetic flux turns out to be exactly zero ) by producing a modification of the _ linear _ polarization signals ( with respect to the zero magnetic field reference case ) that we can really `` measure '' if we succeed in rigorously modeling polarization signals due to multiple - scattering processes in the presence of weak magnetic fields . in conclusion , besides being useful for `` measuring '' magnetic fields in solar prominences , the hanle effect offers a promising diagnostic tool for the investigation of weak _ photospheric _ fields with mixed polarities over small spatial scales and for the exploration of chromospheric magnetic fields ( because chromospheric lines are generally broad and the magnetic fields of the solar chromosphere relatively weak ) .",
    "figure 3 illustrates what has just been pointed out in relation to the diagnostic interest of the hanle and zeeman effects .",
    "a suitable illustration of the fact that the hanle effect only operates in the doppler core has been provided by stenflo ( 1998 ) for the case of a @xmath47 line transition .",
    "in the standard multilevel radiative transfer problem ( see mihalas , 1978 ) the only quantity related to the radiative line transitions that plays a role in the statistical equilibrium equations is :    @xmath48    where @xmath10 is the frequency measured from line centre in units of the doppler width , @xmath49 the absorption line shape , @xmath50 the direction of propagation of the ray , and @xmath51 the specific intensity of the radiation field , i.e. the stokes @xmath52 parameter . regardless of the dependence of the radiation field on frequency and direction this quantity ( @xmath53 ) is always positive .",
    "note also that @xmath54 gives the contribution of the absorption process ( between a lower level @xmath55 and an upper level @xmath56 ) to the natural width of the lower level `` @xmath55 '' ( @xmath57 is the einstein coefficient for such an absorption process ) .",
    "if this lower level is either the _ ground _ or a _ metastable _ level , its lifetime is @xmath58 if and only if the line transition @xmath59 is among the strongest ones .",
    "this applies , for instance , to the lower - levels of the mg @xmath44 lines , to the lower levels of the ca ii ir - triplet , and to many other spectral lines in the solar spectrum .",
    "all such lower levels are _ metastable_. as a result , their lifetimes are about two orders of magnitude larger than the lifetime of the upper levels of the above - mentioned spectral lines .",
    "however , in the most general polarization transfer case , there are eight additional radiation field quantities that play a critical role in the statistical equilibrium equations ( see landi deglinnocenti , 1983 ) .",
    "they are the spherical tensors ( @xmath60 ) of the radiation field ( with @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) and they are the quantities we choose to quantify the `` order '' of the radiation field :    @xmath63\\,,\\ ] ]    @xmath64\\,,\\ ] ]    @xmath65\\,,\\ ] ]    @xmath66    @xmath67    where the azimuthal angle @xmath68 and @xmath69 specify the orientation of each ray of direction @xmath50 . the reference direction for the stokes @xmath14 and @xmath34 parameters is situated in the plane perpendicular to @xmath70 and lies in the plane containing @xmath50 and the @xmath18-axis .",
    "the @xmath71 components can be obtained easily from @xmath72^*$ ] ( with @xmath73 , and where the symbol `` * '' means complex conjugation . ) .    in a weakly polarizing medium like the `` quiet '' solar atmosphere ( cf .",
    "snchez almeida and trujillo bueno 1999 ) these radiation field tensors are essentially related with the degree of `` order '' of stokes @xmath52 , with the degree of `` order '' of stokes @xmath14 and @xmath34 , and with the degree of `` order '' of stokes @xmath46 . by degree of `` order ''",
    "i mean , essentially , degree of anisotropy , degree of breaking of the axial symmetry , and degree of `` lack of antisymmetry '' of the stokes @xmath46 parameter .",
    "an example of a completely `` disordered '' radiation field is that of a black body .",
    "it is isotropic , unpolarized and it has axial symmetry around any chosen direction in space .",
    "it is straightforward to show that its only non - zero radiation field tensor is the mean radiation intensity : @xmath74 .",

    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , respectively . to obtain the results of fig .",
    "4 one has to solve the transfer equation in order to calculate the variation with @xmath81 of the stokes @xmath52 parameter ( @xmath82 is the angle between the ray direction and the @xmath18-axis of the reference system , which we choose here along the normal to the stellar surface ) .",
    "note that @xmath83 for the case of an atmosphere with no gradient in the source function ( i.e. the curve with @xmath84 corresponding to @xmath85 ) .",
    "the anisotropy factor ( @xmath86 ) is essentially negative in atmospheres with very small @xmath77 values ( see , for example , the curve with @xmath87 ) , while @xmath88 in atmospheres with sufficiently large @xmath77 ratios ( see , for example , the curves with @xmath89 ) .",
    "note also that the larger @xmath77 the larger the anisotropy factor .",
    "these results can be understood intuitively as follows .",
    "first , note that the tensor @xmath90 ( cf .",
    "5 ) is dominated by the first term having the stokes @xmath52 contribution .",
    "therefore , predominantly _ vertical _ rays ( i.e. those with @xmath91 ) make _ positive _ contributions to @xmath80 , while predominantly _ horizontal _ rays ( i.e. those with @xmath92 ) make _ negative _ contributions is known as van vleck s angle . ] .",
    "second , as illustrated in fig . 5 , in a stellar atmosphere",
    "the _ outgoing _ intensities diminish with decreasing @xmath93 ( i.e. they show _ limb darkening _ ) , while the _ incoming _ intensities augment with decreasing @xmath93 ( i.e. they show _ limb brightening _ ) . in other words , in a stellar atmosphere the outgoing radiation is predominantly vertical , while the incoming radiation is predominantly horizontal .",
    "thus , the outgoing intensities tend to produce _ positive _ contributions to @xmath80 , while the incoming intensities tend to produce _ negative _ contributions .",
    "therefore , there is competition .",
    "it wins the subset of intensities ( outgoing or incoming ) having the largest variation with @xmath93 .",
    "if @xmath84 the source function is constant ( @xmath85 ) and the outgoing intensities have no @xmath93 dependence .",
    "this implies that @xmath94 because the incoming intensities always show a dependence with @xmath93 , even for a constant - property atmosphere .",
    "this is simply due to the presence of the stellar surface .",
    "however , as soon as @xmath77 becomes `` large enough '' the _ limb darkening _ of the outgoing intensities becomes more important than the _ limb brightening _ of the incoming intensities and the anisotropy factor ( @xmath95 ) becomes positive .",
    "it is straightforward to show that , for a given temperature gradient of the model atmosphere , the corresponding source function gradient is larger the bluer we go in the spectrum .",
    "this is the main reason why the anisotropy factor generally increases as we move in the spectrum from the ir toward the uv .    the anisotropy factor ( cf .",
    "10 ) is a fundamental quantity in scattering polarization .",
    "it is also of interest to note that its possible values are bounded as dictated by the following expression :    @xmath96    in the chosen reference frame ( with the @xmath18-axis along the radial stellar direction ) , the largest @xmath95 value corresponds to an illumination coming from purely vertical ( radial ) radiation beams and the lowest one to a purely horizontal radiation field .",
    "the remaining radiation field tensors are more subtle , but their physical meaning can also be understood intuitively . the tensors @xmath97 ( with @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) are complex quantities .",
    "they quantify the breaking of the axial symmetry of the stokes @xmath52 , @xmath14 and @xmath34 parameters .",
    "if the physical properties of the stellar atmosphere model depend only on the radial direction , the ensuing @xmath97 tensors ( with @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) are zero unless the magnetic field is _ inclined _ with respect to the radial direction .",
    "figure 6 shows the variation with depth in a stellar model atmosphere of the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath97 tensors normalized to @xmath79 .",
    "note that @xmath100 , i.e. that the degree of `` order '' of the radiation field which interacts with the atoms of the stellar atmospheric model is weak .",
    "this must imply that the degree of `` order '' of the atomic system ( i.e. the atomic polarization ) has also to be weak .",
    "these considerations can suitably be taken into account in order to facilitate some analytical insight into and the numerical solution of the general equations .",
    "[ jbar ]    the tensors @xmath101 are related to the circular polarization .",
    "note that @xmath102 if the stokes @xmath46 profile is perfectly antisymmetric , and that @xmath103 if there is no azimuthal @xmath68 dependence in the stokes @xmath46 parameter .",
    "we thus need to have net circular polarization in order to permit non - zero values for the @xmath101 tensors .",
    "the most general situation in which all the above - mentioned radiation field tensors are non - zero is the case of a magnetized stellar atmosphere with macroscopic velocity gradients . in this article",
    "i will consider static stellar atmospheres for which the @xmath101 tensors can be assumed to be zero .",
    "as shown in section 5 , i will focus mainly on the generation of atomic _ alignment _ , which is directly related to the @xmath97 tensors and with the hanle effect ( i.e. with the modification of the _ linear polarization _ signals due to weak magnetic fields ) . in a future occasion",

    "the `` order '' of the atomic system ( i.e. the _ atomic polarization _ ) can be suitably quantified via the atomic density operator ( @xmath104 ) of quantum mechanics .",
    "this operator is represented in the basis @xmath105 of energy eigenvectors via a matrix called the _ atomic density matrix _ whose elements are :    @xmath106    as clarified below , the diagonal elements ( @xmath107 ) quantify the population of the state @xmath108 , while the non - diagonal elements ( @xmath109 , with @xmath110 ) quantify the degree of _ quantum interference _ ( or _ coherence _ ) between the states @xmath108 and @xmath111 .",
    "let us give some information regarding the exact meaning of the atomic density matrix .",

    "the quantum - mechanical hamiltonian operator @xmath112 of the whole system can be written , in the schrdinger representation , in the form @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the unperturbed hamiltonian made up of the sum of the energies of the atoms , radiation and perturbers , while @xmath115 accounts for the various possible interactions among atoms , perturbers and radiation .",

    "recall also that the emission vector and the absorption matrix are the two fundamental quantities which appear in the stokes - vector transfer equation .    finally , an additional reason for the suitability of the spherical tensor representation is that the limiting case in which polarization phenomena are neglected ( cf .",
    "mihalas , 1978 ) can be obtained simply by retaining only the terms with @xmath188 .",
    "there are two mechanisms which can lead to transfer of `` order '' from the radiation field to the atomic system : _ upper - level _ selective population pumping and _ lower - level _ selective depopulation pumping .",
    "the requirements are that the pumping light must be necessarily _ anisotropic _ , and/or _ polarized _ and/or to have _ spectral structure _ over a frequency interval @xmath189 smaller than the frequency separation between the zeeman sublevels .    *",
    "upper - level population pumping * occurs when some _ upper - state _ sublevels have more chances of being populated than others .",
    "for instance , if an unpolarized light beam propagating along the direction chosen as the quantization axis illuminates a gas of two level atoms with @xmath1 and @xmath2 , only the transitions corresponding to @xmath190 are effective , so that no transitions occur to the @xmath191 sublevel of the upper level .",
    "thus , in the absence of any relaxation mechanisms , the upper - level sublevels with @xmath192 and @xmath193 would be more populated than the @xmath191 sublevel and the fractional upper - level alignment coefficient @xmath194 .",
    "* lower - level depopulation pumping * occurs when some _ lower - state _ sublevels absorb light more strongly than others . as a result",
    "an excess population tends to build up in the weakly absorbing sublevels .",
    "for instance , if an unpolarized light beam propagating along the direction chosen as the quantization axis illuminates a gas of two level atoms with @xmath195 and @xmath196 , only the transitions corresponding to @xmath190 are effective , so that no transitions can occur out of the @xmath191 sublevel of the lower level . on the other hand , the spontaneous de - excitation from the upper level populates with equal probability the three sublevels ( @xmath197 ) of the _ lower _ level . in the absence of any relaxation mechanisms ,",
    "the final result of this optical - pumping cycle is that all atoms will eventually be pumped into the @xmath191 sublevel of the _ lower _ level , and the medium will become transparent ( happer , 1972 ) . under such ideal laboratory conditions ( illumination by a unidirectional light beam and absence of depolarizing mechanisms ) the fractional lower - level alignment coefficient is @xmath198 , i.e. _ a factor 2 larger _ ( in absolute value ) _ than the fractional upper - level alignment corresponding to the previous triplet - line case_.    the nobel laureate alfred kastler ( 1950 ) was actually the first scientist to propose that optical pumping under laboratory conditions can be used as a method to change the relative populations of zeeman sublevels and of hyperfine levels of the ground state of atoms .",
    "what we have been emphasizing over the last few years is that the very same mechanism ( lower - level depopulation pumping ) is operating in the atmospheres of the stars , and that it constitutes _ an essential physical ingredient for understanding the second solar spectrum_.    lower - level depopulation pumping in solar - like atmospheres was investigated in detail by trujillo bueno and landi deglinnocenti ( 1997 ) including depolarizing collisions and radiative transfer effects .",
    "we chose that particular type of line transition ( i.e. @xmath199 ) to point out clearly that lower - level depopulation pumping due to the anisotropy of the solar radiation field can lead to sizeable amounts of ground - level atomic polarization and to emergent linear polarization signals with amplitudes in the observable range . soon afterwards , landi deglinnocenti ( 1998 ) succeeded in deriving analytical expressions for the stokes-@xmath14 component of the emission vector and of the absorption matrix corresponding to the d@xmath200 and d@xmath40 lines of na i , and could show by adjusting free parameters that a certain amount of atomic polarization in the hyperfine components of the ground level of sodium leads to a remarkably good fit of the complex fractional linear polarization pattern observed by stenflo and keller ( 1997 ) , including the `` enigmatic '' line - centre peaks . a subsequent theoretical investigation ( trujillo bueno 1999 )",
    "was aimed at demonstrating that _ depopulation pumping _ in the solar atmosphere ( and the induced lower - level atomic polarization ) can actually produce similar amounts of linear polarization for some groups of line transitions ( having different @xmath176 and @xmath175 values ) for which the simplified resonance line polarization theory ( which neglects the influence of _ lower - level _ depopulation pumping ) predicts drastically different emergent polarizations .",
    "based on this result , i suggested a possible explanation of the `` enigmatic '' linear polarization amplitudes observed by stenflo _",
    "et al . _ ( 1983 , 2000 ) in the mg i @xmath44 lines ( see trujillo bueno 1999 ; sections 6 and 7 ) . that theoretical investigation demonstrated that the presence of a sizeable amount of atomic polarization in the _ metastable _ lower - levels of the mg @xmath201 and @xmath202 lines would explain in a natural way the similar polarization amplitudes observed in the mg @xmath44 lines ( and also those observed in the three lines of multiplet no . 3 of ca i , which is also a @xmath203 multiplet ) .",
    "this result for the mg @xmath44 lines was particularly encouraging because , contrary to the case of the sodium d - lines , it is totally impossible to argue that there might perhaps exist an alternative explanation of the observed polarization peaks based on a multilevel scenario characterized by the absence of lower - level polarization ( see trujillo bueno 1999 ; sections 5 and 6 ) .",
    "in addition to the two previous pumping mechanisms , which allow the direct transfer of `` order '' from the radiation field to the atomic system , there is an additional pumping process which also comes into play : _",
    "repopulation pumping_. this pumping occurs either when the _ lower - level _ is repopulated as a result of spontaneous decay of a _ polarized _ upper level or when the _ upper - level _ is repopulated as a result of absorptions of a _ polarized _ lower level . as can be intuitively expected ,",
    "the repopulation pumping rates are proportional to the atomic polarization of the atomic levels .",
    "the best thing we can do to facilitate understanding of all these pumping mechanisms is to show them in action for a particularly illuminating example : the scattering line polarization problem in a one - dimensional _ unmagnetized _ stellar atmosphere formed by a gas of two level atoms with @xmath204 ( cf .",

    "we prefer option @xmath44 ( which is in fact the choice in sections 6 and 7 ) . however , as done in the remaining part of this section , it is convenient to formulate the rate equations in the magnetic field reference frame if the interest lies in achieving some analytical insight .",

    "my motivation behind this choice is two - fold .",
    "first , it is precisely the configuration of the raman scattering process , in which a photon of one frequency is absorbed and a second frequency may be re - emitted .",
    "second , this particular three - level atomic system will help to understand physically our successful modeling of the `` enigmatic '' fractional linear polarization observed by stenflo _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) in the ca ii ir triplet ( see manso sainz and trujillo bueno 2001a ) . to this end , the atomic parameters of the @xmath278 transition have been chosen to be identical to that of the h line of ca ii , while those of the @xmath279 transition correspond to that of the 8662 @xmath39 line of the ca ii ir triplet .",
    "the observations were considered `` enigmatic '' especially because this 8662 @xmath39 line should be , according to stenflo _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) , intrinsically unpolarizable . however , their observations show a polarized peak ( see also dittmann _ et al .",
    "they considered this line `` intrinsically unpolarizable '' because its upper level ( and also the lower level of the h - line ) can not harbour any atomic alignment ( because @xmath276 and calcium has no hyperfine structure ) .",
    "[ hanle6 ]    figure 7 shows the self - consistent results for the _ unmagnetized _ case .",
    "the thin line of the left panel gives the variation with line optical depth of the fractional atomic polarization of the lower level of the 8662 @xmath39 line ( whose @xmath277 ) .",
    "the thick line shows the variation of the anisotropy factor at this wavelength ( it actually shows the variation of @xmath280 ) .",
    "we see that depopulation pumping due to the @xmath279 transition at 8662 @xmath39 is able to generate sizeable unequal populations among their lower - level sublevels . if one now uses our eddington  barbier relation ( i.e. eq .",
    "30 ) and takes into account that for a @xmath281 transition @xmath282 and @xmath283 , one ends up understanding the computed emergent fractional linear polarization shown in the _ rhs _ figure .",
    "this emergent polarization at @xmath38 is totally due to _ dichroism _ in the _ non - magnetized _ solar model atmosphere ( see trujillo bueno 1999 ; page 82 ) . in other words ,",
    "the generation of the observed linear polarization in the ca ii 8662 @xmath39 line necessarily requires a transfer process along the line of sight .",
    "this is needed in order to allow the q - component of the _ absorption _ matrix ( i.e. @xmath177 , which is non - zero because the lower level @xmath284 is polarized ) to make its influence on the emergent linear polarization .",
    "component of the _ emission _ vector is _ zero _ because the upper level can not harbour any atomic alignment .",
    "] this is precisely the physical origin of the linear polarization of the chromospheric ca ii 8662 @xmath39 line observed close to the `` quiet '' solar limb .",
    "it is important to point out that the calculated line - core fractional polarization amplitude ( @xmath285 as seen in fig .",
    "7 ) is an order of magnitude _ larger _ than the observed one .",
    "this `` discrepancy '' is due to two reasons : ( 1 ) because the result of fig .",
    "7 corresponds to a very simple model atom with only three levels and ( 2 ) because the magnetic field has been assumed to be zero . as shown in this volume by manso sainz and trujillo bueno ( 2001a ) the line - core amplitude for the zero magnetic field reference case",
    "is reduced by about a factor 4 when a realistic five - level atomic model for ca ii is considered ( which includes the collisional coupling between the two _ metastable _ levels @xmath284 and @xmath286 ) .",
    "the remaining `` discrepancy '' is likely due to the hanle effect of the chromospheric magnetic field , as illustrated in section 7 .",
    "another interesting example of a group of lines having the same angular momentum values and showing a very similar observed behaviour is given by the three lines of multiplet no .",
    "2 of ba ii ( see the atlas of gandorfer 2000 ; and note that @xmath287 of the total barium abundance has no hyperfine structure splitting ) .      consider the case of multiplet @xmath203 , which leads to three spectral lines with a common upper level .",

    "however , as mentioned above , the observations show _ positive _ polarization for the three lines , and with similar amplitudes .",
    "[ hanle9 ]    what could be the physical origin and explanation of the above - mentioned observations ? in a previous keynote article ( cf .",
    "trujillo bueno 1999 ) i suggested that one could explain such spectropolarimetric observations if we had ( at line - core optical depth unity along the line of sight ) the following amounts of atomic polarization in the metastable _ lower levels _ of the mg @xmath201 and @xmath202 lines :    * for the lower level of the @xmath202 line @xmath303 @xmath304 .",
    "* for the lower level of the @xmath201 line @xmath303 @xmath305 .",
    "this `` explanation '' is based on the direct mapping that eq .",
    "( 30 ) implies : the observed polarization amplitudes are giving us directly the atomic polarization of the lower and upper levels at optical depth unity along the line of sight !",
    "the crucial question now is : are these the atomic polarization values obtained from self - consistent _ multilevel _ scattering polarization calculations in semi - empirical models of the solar chromosphere ?",
    "the answer is affirmative , as indeed results from a realistic multilevel coherency transfer calculation for a 19-level model atom for mg i - mg ii ( see fig .",
    "the results of this figure show that the _ metastable _ lower - levels of the mg i @xmath201 and @xmath202 lines are _ polarized _ by the anisotropic radiation field of typical semi - empirical solar chromospheric models .",
    "the relative amplitudes of the calculated emergent polarizations of the three mg @xmath44-lines at @xmath38 agree fairly well with the observations , with _ dichroism _ playing again a critical role .",
    "the lower - level @xmath284 of the ca ii 8662 @xmath39 line is _ metastable_. therefore , from eq . ( 3 ) , its atomic polarization and the emergent linear polarization have to be sensitive to milligauss fields .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "9 , which shows the self - consistent values of the @xmath147-elements for a horizontal field of 10 milligauss .",
    "the assumed _ horizontal _ field lies in the @xmath306-plane of the reference system indicated in the `` north solar pole '' example of figure 1 .",
    "it is orientated at 45 degrees ( measured from @xmath10 towards @xmath11 ) . fig .",
    "9 shows the fractional population imbalances ( @xmath307 ) and the coherences ( @xmath308 , with @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) in percentage .",
    "note that the 10 milligauss of the assumed horizontal field are sufficient to reduce the population imbalances of the @xmath284 level by a factor 3 approximately ( compare with the thin solid line of fig .",
    "moreover , we now have non - zero coherences , _ which are of the same order of magnitude as the population imbalances themselves_. the emergent fractional linear polarization ( @xmath309 and @xmath310 ) close to the stellar limb ( @xmath38 ) and along the @xmath10-axis of fig . 1 ( i.e. a direction of observation with azimuth @xmath311 and @xmath38 ) is shown in figure 10 .",
    "note that the @xmath309 amplitude is a factor 3 smaller than the one corresponding to the zero magnetic field reference case of fig . 7 , and that @xmath310 is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath309 .",
    "what is the physical origin of this @xmath310 profile ?",
    "it is exclusively due to the _ coherences _ of the metastable _ lower - level _ of the ca ii 8662 @xmath39 line , because @xmath312 , while @xmath313 ( see the paragraph after eq . 25 ) .",
    "in fact , it is possible to derive eddington ",
    "barbier relations for the @xmath309 and @xmath310 emergent polarizations due to the hanle effect . this can be done along similar lines to those which lead to eq .",
    "( 30 ) for the unmagnetized reference case . particularizing the eddington ",
    "barbier relation for @xmath310 to the direction of observation chosen to obtain the exact results of fig . 10",

    "note that @xmath283 , with @xmath229 the symbol introduced after eq .",
    "therefore , a positive detection of a @xmath310 signal close to the limb ( @xmath38 ) would be a clean observational demonstration of the existence of metastable - level _",
    "coherences_.    let us now consider what happens when the intensity of the same horizontal field is 10 gauss . as indicated by the dashed - lines of figs .",
    "9 and 10 , the @xmath147-elements and the emergent linear polarization are modified .",
    "the population imbalances of the @xmath284 level are not destroyed and some of its coherences remain .. note also that the emergent @xmath309 in this saturated gauss regime still has a sizeable amplitude ( @xmath317 ) , which is due to the atomic polarization of the metastable @xmath284 lower - level when we use , instead of a three - level model , a realistic 5-level atomic model including the collisional coupling between the metastable levels @xmath284 and @xmath286 . ] .",
    "in other words , the atomic polarization of long - lived atomic levels in the solar chromosphere may still be sufficiently significant ( even after the partial destruction caused by a 10 gauss purely horizontal field with a deterministic or random azimuth ! )",
    "so as to be able to lead to emergent @xmath309 signals in the observable range . in a forthcoming publication we will show in detail that a consistent explanation of the observed @xmath309 in the _ three _ lines of the ca ii ir triplet does _ not _ necessarily requires to constrain the magnetic field to be either extremely low ( with @xmath318 milligauss ) or vertically orientated ( but with an intensity in the gauss regime ) .",
    "note that i am _ not _ saying that the chromospheric magnetic field is predominantly horizontal .",
    "i am basically pointing out that some of the `` enigmatic '' features of the _ second solar spectrum _ are due to metastable - level atomic polarization and that the amount of this atomic polarization in topologically complex magnetic field scenarios with intensities in the gauss regime can still be sufficiently significant so as to lead to the observed @xmath309 polarization amplitudes .",
    "finally , it may be found useful to distinguish between five hanle effect regimes in relation with the polarization of a spectral line whose lower level is the ground or a metastable level .",
    "these hanle regimes can be established according to the values of @xmath259 and @xmath258 and by noting that , for a given magnetic field intensity , @xmath319 ( because the lower - level lifetime is about two orders of magnitude larger than the upper - level lifetime ) . as mentioned earlier , in this section we are using the reference system whose @xmath18-axis is directed along the radial direction of the star :    * * regime 1 : * @xmath320 and @xmath321 + in this regime the atomic alignment of the lower level of the line transition of interest is typically of the same order of magnitude as the upper - level alignment ( i.e. @xmath322 ) .",
    "we find here the maximum possible @xmath309 amplitude .",
    "* * regime 2 : * @xmath323 and @xmath324 + in this regime the emergent polarization is sensitive to milligauss fields .",
    "* * regime 3 : * @xmath325 and @xmath324 + in this regime we have @xmath326 . *",
    "* regime 4 : * @xmath325 and @xmath327 + in this regime the emergent polarization is sensitive to magnetic fields in the gauss regime . *",
    "* regime 5 : * @xmath325 and @xmath328 + we again find that @xmath322 , but with lower individual values for @xmath329 and @xmath330 than for the unmagnetized reference case .",
    "the emergent polarization is sensitive only to the field orientation . in this regime",
    ", one should find relative amplitudes of the linear polarizations observed in multiplets ( e.g. in the mg i @xmath44 lines ) similar to those found for the unmagnetized reference case .",
    "this emphasizes the importance of an accurate quantification of the observed polarization amplitudes in order to infer correctly the intensity and inclination of the magnetic field .",
    "this review article , besides providing an introduction to optical pumping , atomic polarization and the hanle effect , has advanced some new results which we will publish in suitable journals during the following months .",
    "of particular interest for the reader who looks at the sun as a unique physics laboratory is the conclusion that _ the quiet solar chromosphere is a polarized vapor with optical properties similar to those of an anisotropic crystal_.    on the other hand , the reader interested mainly in the remote sensing of solar and stellar magnetic fields should feel optimistic because the quest for understanding the physical origin of the `` second solar spectrum '' is now becoming one of the success stories of astrophysics .",
    "we had the theory ( cf .",
    "landi deglinnocenti 1983 ) .",
    "we had the observations ( cf . stenflo and keller 1997 ; stenflo _ et al .",
    "and now we have the _ self - consistent _ radiative transfer modeling , which is the essential link between theory and observations . in the following years rigorous confrontations of observations of weak polarization signals with numerical simulations of scattering polarization and of the hanle and zeeman effects should lead to fundamental new insights in our understanding of solar photospheric and chromospheric magnetism .",
