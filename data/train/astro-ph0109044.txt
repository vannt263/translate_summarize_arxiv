    "since the discovery of the grb optical counterparts in 1997 @xcite a great effort in the field has been carried out from many ground - based observatories . here we present a summary of the optical / ir follow - up observations performed in 1999 - 2000 from several observatories based in spain ; la palma , izaa and calar alto ( caha ) .",
    "we have performed optical and ir observations in 1999 - 2000 for many sax , xte and ipn grb error boxes .    for the optical observations we have used the following telescopes : the 1.5osn , int , iac80 , jkt , not , tcs , 1.23-m caha and specially the 2.2-m caha telescope .",
    "the observations at jkt , not , iac80 and int were performed at spanish time .",
    "the caha observations were done by means of override programs either at german time ( p.i . : j. greiner and s. klose ) or spanish time ( p.i .",
    "castro - tirado ) .    concerning the ir follow - ups ,",
    "the observations have been mostly performed from caha , which is equipped with ir instrumentation very suitable for grb follow - ups . among the ir instruments mounted on the caha telescopes we would like to remark omega - cass and omega - prime mounted on the 3.5-m telescope .",
    "the field of view ( fov ) of omega - prime ( @xmath0 ) and omega - cass ( up to @xmath1 ) allow to cover sax ( and even ipn ) error boxes with single pointings , avoiding inconvenient mosaics . also the magic ir camera mounted on",
    "the 1.23-m telescope is a very important support of the observations performed at the 3.5-m telescope , as occurred for the discovery of the grb000418 counterpart @xcite .",
    "as it can be seen in table  1 the most used telescope / instrumentation is the 2.2m(+cafos ) configuration .",
    "the large fov of cafos ( diameter of 16@xmath2 ) is specially useful to cover ipn and xte error boxes .",
    "we have not included in table  1 the observations carried out by the bootes alerting system ( see @xcite ) .",

    "among the fifteen optical counterparts discovered in 1999 - 2000 nine were visible from spain , begin seven of them detected ( only grb990308 and grb000911 were not detected ) .",
    "two of these seven afterglows were discovered from caha ( grb991208 and grb000926 , this last one co - discovered jointly with the not @xcite ) .",
    "these numbers show the relevant role that observations from spain ( and specially from caha ) have played in the grb field .",
    "we are very grateful to the tac of caha and iac for granting time for our grb too programs .",
