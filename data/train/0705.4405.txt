    "systems with long - range interactions are numerous in nature @xcite .",
    "some examples include self - gravitating systems , two - dimensional vortices , neutral and non - neutral plasmas , bacterial populations , defects in solids , etc ... when the potential of interaction is attractive and unshielded , these systems can spontaneously organize into _ coherent structures _ accounting for the diversity of the objects observed in the universe .",
    "for example , self - gravitating systems organize into planets , stars , galaxies , clusters of galaxies ... on the other hand , two - dimensional turbulent flows organize into jets ( like the gulf stream on the earth ) or large - scale vortices ( like jupiter s great red spot in the jovian atmosphere ) .",
    "biological populations ( like bacteria , amoebae , endothelial cells , ... ) also interact via long - range signals through the phenomenon of chemotaxis .",
    "chemotactic aggregation leads to the spontaneous appearance of patterns like stripes and spots , filaments , vasculature , ... although these astrophysical , hydrodynamical and biological systems are physically different , they share a lot of analogies due to the long - range attractive nature of the potential of interaction @xcite .    in view of the complexity of these systems",
    ", it is natural to try to understand their structure and organization in terms of statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "since systems with long - range interactions are generically spatially inhomogeneous , it is clear at first sights that the usual thermodynamic limit @xmath1 with @xmath3 fixed is not valid .",
    "therefore , the ordinary methods of statistical mechanics and kinetic theory must be reformulated and adapted to these systems .",
    "we shall assume , however , that the basic concepts are not altered so that the description of these systems must be done in consistency with the foundations of statistical mechanics and kinetic theory .",
    "in previous papers of this series @xcite ( denoted papers i and ii ) , we have undertaken a systematic study of the dynamics and thermodynamics of systems with long - range interactions . in paper",
    "i , we have considered the statistical equilibrium states and the static correlation functions .",
    "we have shown that there exists a critical temperature @xmath4 ( for brownian systems ) or a critical energy @xmath5 ( for hamiltonian systems ) above which the system is spatially homogeneous and below which the homogeneous phase becomes unstable and is replaced by a clustered phase . in paper ii , using an analogy with plasma physics , we have developed a kinetic theory of systems with long - range interactions in the homogeneous phase . in the present paper ( paper iii )",
    ", we propose new derivations of the kinetic equations that take into account non - markovian effects and that can be applied to spatially _ inhomogeneous _ configurations .",
    "these extensions are specific to systems with unshielded long - range interactions and they are novel with respect to the much more studied case of neutral plasmas .",
    "they complete the results of paper ii that were only valid for spatially homogeneous and markovian systems .",
    "however , a limitation of the present approach is to neglect collective effects .",
    "these effects were taken into account in paper ii for spatially homogeneous systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_bbgky ] , we derive a general kinetic equation for hamiltonian systems with weak long - range interactions from the bbgky hierarchy .",
    "this equation is valid at order @xmath6 in an expansion of the solutions of the equations of the hierarchy in powers of @xmath0 in the proper thermodynamic limit @xmath1 defined in paper i. for @xmath1 , this kinetic equation reduces to the vlasov equation . at order @xmath6 it takes into account the effect of `` collisions '' ( more properly `` correlations '' ) between particles due to finite @xmath2 effects ( graininess ) .",
    "it describes therefore the evolution of the system on a timescale @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the dynamical time .",
    "this general kinetic equation applies to systems that can be spatially inhomogeneous and takes into account non - markovian effects .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to spatially homogeneous systems and neglect memory terms , we recover the landau equation as a special case . in secs .",
    "[ sec_qss ] and [ sec_dis ] , we use this kinetic theory to discuss the processes of violent collisionless relaxation and slow collisional relaxation in systems with weak long - range interactions .",
    "we review several results obtained for self - gravitating systems , two - dimensional vortices and the hmf model , emphasize their connections and try to explain them in the light of the kinetic theory . in particular , we investigate the dependence of the relaxation time with the system size .",
    "we also propose a scenario according to which , for a large class of initial conditions , the transient states of the collisional relaxation of the hmf model could be described by spatially homogeneous tsallis distributions ( polytropes ) with a compact support and with an index @xmath9 slowly decreasing with time until they become vlasov unstable and relax towards the boltzmann distribution .",
    "in this section , we derive a general kinetic equation ( [ g4 ] ) for hamiltonian systems with weak long - range interactions .",
    "we start from the bbgky hierarchy and use a systematic expansion of the solutions of the equations of this hierarchy in powers of @xmath0 in a proper thermodynamic limit @xmath1 .",
    "the kinetic equation ( [ g4 ] ) is valid at order @xmath6 .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath2 particles with long - range interactions described by the hamiltonian equations ( i-1 ) . basically , the evolution of the @xmath2-body distribution function is governed by the liouville equation ( i-2 ) .",
    "introducing the reduced probability distributions ( i-6 ) , we can construct the complete bbgky hierarchy ( ii-1 ) .",
    "the first two equations of this hierarchy , governing the evolution of the one and two - body distributions @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are given by eqs .",
    "( ii-2 ) and ( ii-3 ) .",
    "we recall that @xmath12 stands for ( @xmath13 .",

    "( ii-2 ) , we first obtain @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the force by unit of mass created by particle @xmath18 on particle @xmath19 . it is related to the potential of interaction @xmath20 by @xmath21 then , substituting the decompositions ( i-14 ) and ( i-15 ) in ( ii-3 ) and using eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) to simplify some terms , we get and @xmath22 which is not correct if we consider terms of order @xmath6 . ]",
    "@xmath23 equations ( [ e1])-([e3 ] ) are exact for all @xmath2 but the hierarchy is not closed .",
    "we shall now consider the thermodynamic limit defined in paper i. it corresponds to @xmath1 in such a way that the normalized temperature @xmath24 and the normalized energy @xmath25 are fixed , where @xmath26 represents the typical strength of the potential of interaction .",
    "in general , the potential of interaction is written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the coupling constant ( e.g. , @xmath29 for self - gravitating systems or @xmath28 for the hmf model ) . by a suitable normalization of the parameters ,",
    "this thermodynamic limit is such that the coupling constant behaves like @xmath30 while the individual mass @xmath31 , the inverse temperature @xmath32 , the energy per particle @xmath33 and the volume @xmath34 are of order unity . while @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath34 . in this scaling ,",
    "the total mass @xmath38 is of order unity . ]",
    "this implies that @xmath39 and @xmath40 . on the other hand ,",
    "the dynamical time @xmath41 is of order unity ( @xmath42 is the average density and the typical velocity @xmath43 has been obtained by equating the kinetic energy @xmath44 and the potential energy @xmath45 ) .",
    "since the normalized coupling constant @xmath46 goes to zero for @xmath47 , we are studying systems with _ weak _ long - range interactions .",
    "it is argued in papers i and ii that there exists solutions of the whole bbgky hierarchy such that the correlation functions @xmath48 scale like @xmath49 .",
    "this implicitly assumes that the initial condition has no correlation , or that the initial correlations respect this scaling ( if there are strong correlations in the initial state , the system will take a long time to erase them and the kinetic theory will be different from the one developed in the sequel ) .",
    "if this scaling is satisfied , we can consider an expansion of the solutions of the equations of the hierarchy in terms of the small parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this is similar to the expansion in terms of the plasma parameter made in plasma physics .",
    "however , in plasma physics the systems are spatially homogeneous while , in the present case , we shall take into account spatial inhomogeneity .",
    "this brings additional terms in the kinetic equations that are absent in plasma physics .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , the hierarchy that we consider is different from the ordinary bbgky hierarchy . recalling that @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , we obtain at order @xmath0 : @xmath53 @xmath54 if we introduce the notations @xmath55 ( distribution function ) and @xmath56 ( two - body correlation function ) , we get @xmath57 @xmath58 where we have introduced the abbreviations @xmath59 and @xmath60 . we have also introduced the mean force ( by unit of mass ) created in @xmath61 by all the particles @xmath62 and the fluctuating force ( by unit of mass ) created by particle @xmath63 on particle @xmath64 : @xmath65 these equations are exact at the order @xmath6 .",
    "they form therefore the right basis to develop a kinetic theory for hamiltonian systems with weak long - range interactions .",
    "we note that these equations are similar to the bbgky hierarchy of plasma physics but not identical .",
    "one difference is the @xmath66 term in eq .",
    "( [ e6 ] ) .",
    "the other difference is the presence of the fluctuating force @xmath67 instead of @xmath68 due to the spatial inhomogeneity of the system . in plasma physics ,",
    "the system is homogeneous over distances of the order of the debye length so the mean force @xmath69 vanishes .      recalling that @xmath70",
    ", we note that @xmath71 if we consider the limit @xmath1 ( for a fixed time @xmath72 ) , we see that the correlations between particles can be neglected so that the two - body distribution function factorizes in two one - body distribution functions i.e. @xmath73 . therefore the _ mean field approximation _ is exact in the limit @xmath74 . substituting this result in eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) , we obtain the vlasov equation @xmath75 this equation describes the _ collisionless evolution _ of the system up to a time at least of order @xmath76 ( where @xmath8 is the dynamical time ) . in practice ,",
    "@xmath77 so that the domain of validity of the vlasov equation is huge ( for example , in typical stellar systems @xmath78 ) .",
    "when the vlasov equation is coupled to an attractive unshielded long - range potential of interaction , it can develop a process of violent relaxation towards a quasi stationary state ( qss ) .",
    "this process will be discussed specifically in sec .",
    "[ sec_qss ] .",
    "if we want to describe the collisional evolution of the system , we need to consider finite @xmath2 effects . equations ( [ e6 ] ) and ( [ e7 ] ) describe the evolution of the system on a timescale of order @xmath76 .",
    "the equation for the evolution of the smooth distribution function is of the form @xmath79 , \\label{e11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is a `` collision '' term analogous to the one arising in the boltzmann equation . in the present context , there are not real collisions between particles .",
    "the term on the right hand side of eq . ( [ e11 ] ) is due to the development of correlations between particles as time goes on .",
    "it is related to the two - body correlation function @xmath81 which is itself related to the distribution function @xmath82 by eq .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) .",
    "our aim is to obtain an expression for the collision term @xmath83 $ ] at the order @xmath0 .",
    "the difficulty with eq .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) for the two - body correlation function is that it is an integrodifferential equation .",
    "the second term is an advective term , the third term is the _ source _ of the correlation and the third term takes into account the _ retroaction _ of the system as a whole due to a change of the correlation function . in this paper , we shall neglect the contribution of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) .",
    "then , we get the coupled system @xmath84 @xmath85 the integral that we have neglected contains `` collective effects '' that describe the polarization of the medium . in plasma physics",
    ", they are responsible for the debye shielding , i.e. the fact that a charge is surrounded by a polarization cloud of opposite charges that diminish the interaction .",
    "these collective effects are taken into account in the lenard - balescu equation through the dielectric function ( see paper ii ) . however ,",
    "this equation is restricted to spatially homogeneous systems and based on a markovian approximation .",
    "these assumptions are necessary to use laplace - fourier transforms in order to solve the integro - differential equation ( [ e7 ] ) . here",
    ", we want to describe more general situations where the interaction is not shielded so that the system can be spatially inhomogeneous .",
    "if we neglect collective effects , we can obtain a general kinetic equation in a closed form ( [ g4 ] ) that is valid for systems that are not necessarily homogeneous and that can take into account memory effects .",
    "this equation has interest in its own right ( despite its limitations ) because its structure bears a lot of physical significance . before deriving this general equation",
    ", we shall first consider the case of spatially homogeneous systems and make the link with the familiar landau equation .",
    "for a spatially homogeneous system , the distribution function and the two - body correlation function can be written @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in that case ,",
    "( [ e12])-([e13 ] ) become @xmath88 @xmath89 where we have used the fact that @xmath90 and noted @xmath91 and @xmath92 . taking the fourier transform of eq .",
    "( [ l2 ] ) and introducing the notations @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , we obtain @xmath96 in terms of the fourier transform of the correlation function , the kinetic equation ( [ l1 ] ) can be rewritten @xmath97 we shall assume that @xmath98 relaxes on a timescale that is much smaller than the timescale on which @xmath99 changes .",
    "this is the equivalent of the bogoliubov hypothesis in plasma physics .",
    "if we ignore memory effects , we can integrate the first order differential equation ( [ l3 ] ) by considering the last term as a constant .",
    "this yields @xmath100 where we have assumed that no correlation is present initially : @xmath101 .",
    "then , we can replace @xmath102 in eq .",
    "( [ l4 ] ) by its value obtained for @xmath103 , which reads @xmath104 substituting this relation in eq .",
    "( [ l4 ] ) , we obtain the landau equation in the form @xmath105 other equivalent expressions of the landau equation are given in paper ii .",
    "the landau equation ignores collective effects .",
    "collective effects can be taken into account by keeping the contribution of the last integral in eq .",
    "( [ e7 ] ) . for spatially homogeneous systems ,",
    "the calculations can be carried out explicitly in the complex plane @xcite and lead to the lenard - balescu equation discussed in paper ii ( the lenard - balescu equation can be obtained from the landau equation by replacing the potential @xmath106 by the `` screened '' potential @xmath107 including the dielectric function ) .",
    "the landau and lenard - balescu equations conserve mass and energy ( reducing to the kinetic energy for a spatially homogeneous system ) and monotonically increase the boltzmann entropy @xcite .",
    "the collisional evolution is due to a condition of resonance between the particles orbits . for homogeneous systems",
    ", the condition of resonance encapsulated in the @xmath108-function appearing in the landau and lenard - balescu equations corresponds to @xmath109 with @xmath110 . for @xmath111 ,",
    "the only stationary solution is the maxwell distribution . because of the @xmath112-theorem , the landau and lenard - balescu equations relax towards the maxwell distribution . since the collision term in eq .",
    "( [ l7 ] ) is valid at order @xmath6 , the relaxation time scales like @xmath113 as can be seen directly from eq .",
    "( [ l7 ] ) by dimensional analysis ( comparing the l.h.s . and the r.h.s . , we have @xmath114 while @xmath115 with the scalings introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec_e ] ) . a more precise estimate of the relaxation time is given in @xcite .",
    "for one - dimensional systems , like the hmf model , the situation is different .",
    "for @xmath116 , the kinetic equation ( [ l7 ] ) reduces to @xmath117 therefore , the collision term @xmath83 $ ] vanishes at the order @xmath0 because there is no resonance .",
    "the kinetic equation reduces to @xmath118 so that the distribution function does not evolve at all on a timescale @xmath119 .",
    "this implies that , for one - dimensional _ homogeneous _ systems , the relaxation time to statistical equilibrium is larger than @xmath7 .",
    "thus , we expect that @xmath120 the fact that the lenard - balescu collision term vanishes in 1d is known for a long time in plasma physics ( see , e.g. , the last paragraph in @xcite ) and has been rediscovered recently in the context of the hmf model @xcite .",
    "the above kinetic equations rely on the assumption that the correlation function relaxes much more rapidly than the distribution function .",
    "the markovian approximation is expected to be a good approximation in the limit @xmath1 that we consider since the distribution function changes on a slow timescale of order @xmath76 ( where @xmath8 is the dynamical time ) or even larger . however , for systems with long - range interactions , there are situations where the decorrelation time of the fluctuations can be very long so that the markovian approximation may not be completely justified .",
    "this concerns in particular the case of self - gravitating systems for which the temporal correlation of the force decreases like @xmath121 ( see @xcite and paper ii ) .",
    "this is also the case for systems that are close to the critical point since the exponential relaxation time of the correlations diverges for @xmath122 or @xmath123 ( see @xcite and paper ii ) .",
    "therefore , it can be of interest to derive non - markovian kinetic equations that may be relevant to such systems .",
    "if we keep the time variation of @xmath124 in eq .",
    "( [ l3 ] ) , we obtain after integration @xmath125 inserting this relation in eq .",
    "( [ l1 ] ) , we obtain a non markovian kinetic equation @xmath126 in particular , for the hmf model , using the notations of paper i , we get @xmath127 we note that , when memory terms are taken into account , the collision term does not vanish . however , if we make the markovian approximation @xmath128 , @xmath129 and extend the time integral to infinity , to @xmath72 ( see appendix [ sec_tempo ] ) . ]",
    "we obtain @xmath130 when memory terms are neglected we recover the fact that the landau collision term vanishes for a spatially homogeneous one - dimensional system . by working close to the critical point in the hmf model ( where the exponential relaxation time of the correlations diverges ) , it may be possible to see non - markovian effects in numerical simulations of the @xmath2-body system .",
    "they should induce a small evolution of the homogeneous system on a timescale @xmath131 as described by eq .",
    "( [ n3 ] ) or , more precisely , by its generalization taking into account collective effects ( see appendix [ sec_tempo ] ) .",
    "this should not lead , however , to statistical equilibrium since eq .",
    "( [ n3 ] ) clearly does not tend to the boltzmann distribution .",
    "relaxing the assumption that the system is spatially homogeneous , the equation ( [ e13 ] ) for the correlation function can be written @xmath132 where we have denoted the advective term by @xmath133 ( liouvillian operator ) . solving formally this equation with the green function @xmath134 we obtain @xmath135 the green function constructed with",
    "the smooth field @xmath136 means that , in order to evaluate the time integral in eq .",
    "( [ g3 ] ) , we must move the coordinates @xmath137 and @xmath138 of the particles with the mean field flow in phase space , adopting a lagrangian point of view .",
    "thus , in evaluating the time integral , the coordinates @xmath139 and @xmath140 placed after the greenian must be viewed as @xmath141 and @xmath142 where @xmath143 substituting eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ e12 ] ) , we get @xmath144 this returns the general kinetic equation obtained by kandrup @xcite with the projection operator formalism ( note that we can replace @xmath145 by @xmath146 in the first term of the r.h.s . of the equation since the fluctuations vanish in average ) . equation ( [ g4 ] ) slightly differs from the equation obtained in @xcite by a term @xmath66 in the l.h.s .",
    "this new derivation of the kinetic equation ( [ g4 ] ) from a systematic expansion of the solutions of the bbgky hierarchy in powers of @xmath0 is valuable because the present formalism is considerably simpler than the projection operator formalism and clearly shows which terms have been neglected in the derivation .",
    "it also clearly shows that _ the kinetic equation ( [ g4 ] ) is valid at order @xmath0 so that it describes the `` collisional '' evolution of the system on a timescale of order @xmath7_.      let us briefly summarize the different kinetic equations that appeared in our analysis .",
    "when collective terms are ignored , the kinetic equation describing the evolution of the system as a whole at order @xmath0 is @xmath147 if we make a markov approximation and extend the time integral to infinity , we obtain @xmath148 as we have indicated , the markov approximation is justified for @xmath1 so that @xmath149 .",
    "we do not assume , however , that the decorrelation time is `` extremely '' short ( i.e , @xmath150 ) .",
    "therefore , in the time integral , the distribution functions must be evaluated at @xmath151 and @xmath152 where @xmath153 comparing eq .",
    "( [ g3cq ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ g3c ] ) , we have assumed that the mean force @xmath154 does not change substantially on the timescale @xmath155 on which the time integral has essential contribution .    for a spatially homogeneous system , using the fact that eq .",
    "( [ g3c ] ) reduces to @xmath156 since @xmath157 , eq .",
    "( [ sum1 ] ) takes the form @xmath158 if we make the integration on @xmath61 , using the relation ( a3 ) of paper ii , we obtain the non markovian equation ( [ n2 ] ) .",
    "if we make the markovian approximation @xmath159 , @xmath160 and extend the time integration to @xmath161 , we get @xmath162 the integrals on @xmath163 and @xmath61 can be performed as in appendix a of paper ii and we finally obtain the landau equation ( [ l7 ] ) .",
    "in this section , we physically discuss the process of violent collisionless relaxation in relation with the vlasov equation ( [ e10 ] ) and point out several analogies between stellar systems , two - dimensional turbulence and the hmf model @xcite .",
    "when the vlasov equation is coupled to an attractive unshielded long - range potential of interaction it can develop a process of phase mixing and violent relaxation leading to the formation of a quasi - stationary state ( qss ) .",
    "this purely mean field process takes place on a very short time scale , of the order of a few dynamical times .",
    "this corresponds to the formation of galaxies in astrophysics , jets and vortices in geophysical and astrophysical flows and clusters in the hmf model .",
    "lynden - bell @xcite has proposed to describe these qss in terms of statistical mechanics , adapting the usual boltzmann procedure so as to take into account the specificities of the vlasov equation ( in particular the conservation of the infinite class of casimirs ) @xcite . _",
    "this approach rests on the assumption that the collisionless mixing is efficient and that the ergodic hypothesis which sustains the statistical theory is fulfilled_. there are situations where the lynden - bell prediction works relatively well . however , there are other situations where the lynden - bell prediction fails .",
    "it has been understood since the beginning @xcite that violent relaxation may be _ incomplete _ in certain cases so that the lynden - bell mixing entropy is _ not _ maximized in the whole available phase space .",
    "incomplete relaxation @xcite can lead to more or less severe deviations from the lynden - bell statistics .",
    "physically , the system tries to reach the lynden - bell maximum entropy state during violent relaxation but , in some cases , it can not attain it because the variations of the potential , that are the engine of the evolution , die away before the relaxation process is complete ( there may be other reasons for incomplete relaxation ) . since the vlasov equation admits an infinite number of stationary solutions , the coarse - grained distribution @xmath164 can be trapped in one of them @xmath165 and remain frozen in that quasi stationary state until collisional effects finally come into play ( on longer timescales ) .",
    "this steady solution is not always the most mixed state ( it can be only partially mixed ) so it may differ from lynden - bell s statistical prediction .",
    "thus , for dynamical reasons , the system does not always explore the whole phase space ergodically .",
    "in general , the statistical theory of lynden - bell gives a relatively good first order prediction of the qss without fitting parameter and is able to explain out - of - equilibrium phase transitions between different types of structures , depending on the values of the control parameters fixed by the initial condition .",
    "however , there are cases where the prediction does not work well ( it can sometimes be very bad ) because of incomplete relaxation .",
    "the difficulty is that we do not know a priori whether the prediction of lynden - bell will work or fail because this depends on the dynamics and it is difficult to know in advance if the system will mix well or not .",
    "therefore , numerical simulations are necessary to determine how close to the lynden - bell distribution the system happens to be .",
    "let us give some examples of complete and incomplete violent relaxation in stellar systems , 2d turbulence and for the hmf model .",
    "the concept of violent relaxation was first introduced by lynden - bell @xcite to explain the apparent regularity of elliptical galaxies in astrophysics . however , for 3d stellar systems the prediction of lynden - bell leads to density profiles whose mass is infinite ( the density decreases as @xmath166 at large distances ) .",
    "in other words , there is no maximum entropy state at fixed mass and energy in an unbounded domain .",
    "furthermore , it is known that the distribution functions ( df ) of galaxies do not only depend on the energy @xmath167 contrary to what is predicted by the lynden - bell statistical theory .",
    "this means that other ingredients are necessary to understand their structure @xcite .",
    "however , the approach of lynden - bell is able to explain why elliptical galaxies have an almost isothermal core . indeed , it is able to justify a boltzmannian distribution @xmath168 in the core without recourse to collisions which operate on a much longer timescale @xmath169 @xcite .",
    "by contrast , violent relaxation is incomplete in the halo .",
    "the concept of incomplete violent relaxation explains why galaxies are more confined than predicted by statistical mechanics ( the density profile of elliptical galaxies decreases as @xmath170 instead of @xmath166 @xcite ) .",
    "we note , however , that elliptical galaxies are not stellar polytropes so their df can not be fitted by the tsallis distribution .",
    "for one dimensional self - gravitating systems , the lynden - bell entropy has a global maximum at fixed mass and energy in an unbounded domain .",
    "early simulations of the 1d vlasov - poisson system starting from a water - bag initial condition have shown a relatively good agreement with the lynden - bell prediction @xcite .",
    "in other cases , the vlasov equation ( and the corresponding @xmath2-body system ) can have a very complicated , non - ergodic , dynamics .",
    "for example , starting from an annulus in phase space , mineau _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have observed the formation of phase - space holes which block the relaxation towards the lynden - bell distribution . in that case , the system does not even relax towards a stationary state of the vlasov equation but develops everlasting oscillations .",
    "for three dimensional self - gravitating systems confined within a box , taruya & sakagami @xcite found numerically that the transient stages of the collisional relaxation of the @xmath2-stars system can be fitted by a sequence of polytropic ( tsallis ) distributions with a time dependent @xmath171 index .",
    "therefore , after the phase of violent relaxation , the system passes by a succession of quasi - stationary solutions of the vlasov equation slowly evolving with time due to collisions ( finite @xmath2 effects ) , until the gravothermal catastrophe associated with the boltzmann distribution finally takes place .      in the context of two - dimensional turbulence ,",
    "miller @xcite and robert & sommeria @xcite have developed a statistical mechanics of the 2d euler equation which is similar to the lynden - bell theory ( see @xcite for a description of this analogy ) .",
    "this theory works relatively well to describe vortex merging @xcite or the nonlinear development of the kelvin - helmholtz instability in a shear layer @xcite .",
    "it can account for the numerous bifurcations observed between different types of vortices ( monopoles , dipoles , tripoles , ... ) @xcite and is able to reproduce the structure of geophysical and jovian vortices like jupiter s great red spot @xcite .",
    "however , some cases of incomplete relaxation have been reported .",
    "for example , in the plasma experiment of huang & driscoll @xcite , the mrs statistical theory gives a reasonable prediction of the qss without fit but the agreement is not perfect @xcite . the observed central density is larger than predicted by theory and the tail decreases more rapidly than predicted by theory , i.e. the vortex is more confined .",
    "this is related to the fact that mixing is not very efficient in the core and in the tail of the distribution ( these features can be explained by developing a kinetic theory of violent relaxation @xcite ) . as observed by boghosian @xcite ,",
    "the qss can be fitted by a tsallis distribution where the density drops to zero at a finite distance .",

    "the system can increase the boltzmann entropy indefinitely by evaporating .",

    "these tsallis distributions are quasi - stationary solutions of the vlasov equation slowly evolving with time under the effect of collisions ( finite @xmath2 effects ) .",

    "@xcite_. this scenario suggests that tsallis distributions can be _ attractors _ ( or at least provide a good fit ) for the transient states of the collisional relaxation , for a large class of initial conditions ( @xmath327 with @xmath187 @xcite ; @xmath327 with @xmath172 @xcite ; and @xmath285 @xcite ) .",
