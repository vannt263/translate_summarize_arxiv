    "migration scenarios must account for the existence of both hot jupiters ( hjs ; gas giants orbiting within 0.1 au of their host stars ) and warm jupiters ( wjs ; orbiting in the region from 0.1 to 1 au ) .",
    "wjs are giant planets observed within the so called period `` valley '' , corresponding to the dip in the giant planet orbital period distribution from roughly @xmath8 to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "thus , wjs are interior to both the ice - line and the observed pileup of giant planets beyond @xmath10au .",
    "while most hjs have nearly zero eccentricities , wjs have a range of eccentricities with a few being on highly eccentric ( @xmath11 ) orbits ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although hjs and wjs appear to be separated in their period and eccentricity distributions it has been suggested that they might share a common origin .",
    "a possibility is that both hjs and wjs migrated inward through high-@xmath3 migration processes such as secular chaos and lidov - kozai  ( lk ) cycles coupled with tidal friction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in this scenario",
    "the hj orbits have been fully circularized by tidal friction , while wjs are still on their way to become hjs and are experiencing large amplitude eccentricity oscillations induced by an external perturber .",
    "in fact , most gas giants observed in the period valley have observed eccentricities that are too small for significant tidal evolution , but this can be understood if they are currently near the low-@xmath3 phase of a lk cycle , while periodically attaining high eccentricities and thereby experiencing significant tidal dissipation .    in this paper",
    "we examine whether high-@xmath3 migration models are consistent with the observed properties of the wj population .",
    "we based our analysis on ( mostly ) radial - velocity data from the exoplanet database at http://exoplanets.org @xcite .",
    "in particular , we focus on planets that have a detected outer companion and that orbit their stellar host interior to @xmath12 .",
    "we use both a high precision three - body integrator as well as an orbit average secular code to produce synthetic populations of migrating planets . by comparing our results to observations we are able to address whether the giant planets observed in the period valley could have formed through secular migration processes .",
    "we find that secular processes do cause giant planets to migrate within the radial range @xmath5 , however the orbital properties of the migrating planets are not consistent with what is observed .",
    "our results are consistent with less than @xmath4 of all gas giants observed in the period valley having migrated through tidal dissipation .",
    "we note that our results are somewhat complementary to those of @xcite .",
    "these authors recently used kepler transit data to show that hjs and wjs are distinct in their respective fractions of sub - jovian companions .",
    "they found that hjs as a whole do not have any detectable inner or outer planetary companions with periods inward of 50 days .",
    "in stark contrast , half of the wjs in their sample have small companions .",
    "motivated by this discovery and by additional arguments , @xcite proposed that a large fraction of wjs are formed in - situ .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we consider all planets within @xmath12 that have a detected outer companion and address the dynamical stability of these systems . in section  3",
    "we describe our numerical methods . in section  4",
    "we describe the results of the @xmath13-body integrations that we used to study the dynamical evolution of systems close to the stability boundary . in sections  5 and 6",
    "we study the dynamical evolution of planets undergoing secular migration and their resulting orbital distribution .",
    "section  7 summarizes our main results .",
    "in this section we discuss the stability of observed jupiter pairs hosting hjs and wjs .",
    "in particular , we examine whether the hj or wj could have reached its current orbit via high - e migration , or whether its having a high-@xmath3 and @xmath14 in the past would instead have made the system dynamically unstable .",
    "the majority of wjs are far enough from their stellar hosts that they are not expected to experience significant tidal dissipation . however ,",
    "if the eccentricity of the wjs are experiencing large amplitude lk oscillations induced by an external perturber , then they might be currently at the low-@xmath3 phase of a lk cycle . over a secular timescale",
    "they might access a periapsis separation such that @xmath15 , within which tidal dissipation will cause efficient migration . in this scenario",
    "the wjs have to be accompanied by a strong enough perturber to overcome schwarzschild precession .",
    "note that at @xmath16 , the additional precession due to tides are negligible compared to schwarzschild precession for typical hosts .",
    "@xcite consider the secular migration scenario for wjs . at the quadrupole level of approximation they derive an analytic upper limit on the outer perturber separation by requiring the wj to reach @xmath17 during lk oscillations : @xmath18^{1/3 } \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{a_{\\rm 1}}{a_{\\rm cr}}}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-e_{\\rm 1}^2 } } \\right)^{-1/3 } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the mass of the host star , @xmath20 the mass of the outer perturber and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 ( @xmath22 ) are the semi - major axis and eccentricity of the inner ( outer ) planet . in the limit @xmath24 and @xmath25 ,",
    "equation  ( [ d+14 ] ) becomes @xmath26 using the above equations @xcite concluded that `` for a wj at @xmath27 , a jupiter perturber is required at @xmath28 '' .",
    "previous work did not consider the stability of the initial configurations that can lead to the formation of a wj in the secular migration scenario .",
    "in addition to the condition equation  ( [ d+14 ] ) one must require the planetary system to be dynamically stable in its initial configuration , i.e. , before tidal dissipation has significantly shrank the orbit of the inner planet .",
    "we compare the observed systems configurations to various stability criteria .",
    "we consider the criterion  @xcite @xmath29^{1/3}\\left(a_2 \\over a_1\\right)^{1/2}+1.15\\ , \\ ] ] which is applicable to planet - star mass ratios @xmath30 and mutual inclinations up to @xmath31 .",
    "this criterion is essentially equivalent to that of @xcite : @xmath32 systems that do not satisfy the condition equation  ( [ pet+15 ] ) and ( [ ek ] ) are expected to be unstable leading to either ejections or collisions . it can be shown by combining equation  ( [ d+14 - 2 ] ) and equation([pet+15 ] ) and taking the limit @xmath33 in this latter equation that for a jupiter mass perturber there are no stable configurations which allow the formation of a wj at @xmath34 .",
    "another often adopted stability criterion is that of @xcite , @xmath35^{2/5}~.\\ ] ] note that the @xcite criterion does not include a dependence on the inner planet orbital eccentricity , and was derived for cases in which the mass ratio between the inner and outer binary is not much different from unity . for these reasons , we consider equations  ( [ pet+15 ] ) and ( [ ek ] ) more accurate for the two planet systems we are considering",
    ". the results of our simulations confirm this .    in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we compute the stability boundaries defined above by adopting the observed orbital parameters of hjs and wjs with a detected companion .",
    "the full sample of planets we considered is presented in table  1 .",
    "we selected systems with two giant planets and that host a jupiter planet with mass @xmath36 and semi - major axis @xmath37 .",
    "the left panel shows the inner jupiter semi - major axis as a function of the critical inner - planet semi - major axis which would render the system unstable according to equations  ( [ pet+15 ] ) and ( [ ma01 ] ) . at larger semi - major axis",
    "the system will be unstable and any secular process leading to high-@xmath3 migration is likely to be suppressed . since a secular migration scenario requires the inner jupiter to have initially an extremely large eccentricity we take the limit @xmath33 when evaluating equation  ( [ pet+15 ] ) . also , we added a factor 0.5 to right hand side of equation  ( [ pet+15 ] ) , which according to @xcite corresponds approximately to @xmath38 chance for a system to be unstable over @xmath39 of evolution .    from the left panel of figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we see that most jupiters at @xmath40 are close or above the stability boundary defined by the dashed line .",
    "clearly this simple fact is difficult to reconcile with a high-@xmath3 migration model for these planets , suggesting that such systems are unlikely to have experienced significant tidal migration from further out .",
    "note that in figure [ fig1 ] the stability boundaries were computed using the minimum mass for the planets .",
    "if the planet orbits were significantly tilted with respect to the line of sight , the planet masses could be significantly larger which will further push the stability boundary towards smaller semi - major axes .    in the region",
    "@xmath41 the two adopted stability criteria start to give somewhat different values for the limiting initial @xmath42 implied by our stability argument . according to equation  ( [ pet+15 ] ) ,",
    "9 out of 10 wjs within @xmath43 could not have migrated from @xmath44 as they would have been dynamically unstable otherwise .",
    "according to equation  ( [ ma01 ] ) instead , 8 out of 10 wjs within @xmath43 would be dynamically unstable at @xmath44 suggesting that they could not have migrated from these distances .",
    "two ( hat - p-13 and kepler-424 ) of the four hjs with known companion have very strong constraints on their maximum separation required by stability , implying that if they formed through secular migration they must have been initially at @xmath45 .",
    "a possibility is that wjs formed by interactions with a planetary companion and began tidal circularization interior to 1 au after multiple scatterings .",
    "however , among the ten wjs detected within @xmath46 only two are above the stability boundary given by equation  ( [ pet+15 ] ) when setting @xmath47 and taking the limit @xmath33 ; these planets are hd-37605c and hd-163607b .",
    "there are also a few systems that at @xmath47 would be classified as unstable according to equation  ( [ pet+15 ] ) but are just above the stability boundary defined by equation  ( [ ma01 ] ) .",
    "these systems are hd-38529 , hd-74156 , hd-13908 and hd-168443 .",
    "further dynamical constraints on a possible high-@xmath3 migration scenario for some of these systems are presented in the next sections .    in the right panel of figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the stability boundary in equation  ( [ pet+15 ] ) for our sample of two - planet systems .",
    "we also identify the region where @xmath38 of the systems according to equation  ( [ pet+15 ] ) would be unstable after @xmath48 of evolution .",
    "surprisingly , some of these planets appear to be well inside the dynamically unstable region . as also noted by @xcite , however , the stability of these systems might be promoted by mean - motion resonances ( some of which are indicated in figure [ fig1 ] ) . in any case , it is hard to imagine how these planets could have been transported from further out through secular migration processes .",
    "the stability analysis shown in figure [ fig1 ] suggests that most wjs and hjs with observed companions can not have migrated to their current location via tidal dissipation from @xmath49 .",
    "this idea is further explored and supported by the analysis presented in the following sections .    in table 1",
    "we give the orbital parameters of observed two planet systems with an inner wj or hj and summarize the results of our stability analysis .",
    "importantly , and contrary to previous work @xcite , we note that our analysis disfavors a high migration origin for most wjs with a companion , including those having a finite orbital eccentricity ( @xmath50 ) .    ) .",
    "the inner planet evolves to attain an orbit that is consistent with the orbits of the observed planets .",

    "non - migrating planets have final semi - major axis @xmath57 ( for @xmath54 ) or @xmath58 ( for @xmath56 ) ; `` disrupted '' systems are those in which the inner planet had crossed its roche limit . in the first models we run the integrations up to a maximum time of @xmath59 . in the last three models ( c1-c , c2-c , c3-c ) the final integration time",
    "was chosen randomly between @xmath60 and @xmath59 .",
    "this latter choice is to simulate a scenario in which the planets have formed continuously over the last @xmath61 . in order to account for the fact that we have only selected systems with an inclination @xmath62",
    ", we have reduced the number of forming hjs and wjs ( and disrupted ) by @xmath63 , and then used that number in the fraction .",
    "[ tb2 ]    in this section we run suites of lk simulations , in which systems are initizialized with two jupiter mass planets at high mutual inclination . by comparing the ratio of wjs to cold jupiters ( cjs ) found in the simulations to that ratio as observed we put constraints on the fraction of observed wjs that are likely to have undergone high-@xmath3 lk migration .    in our simulations",
    "we set the mass of the inner planet to @xmath64 and sample the mass of the outer perturber uniformly in the range @xmath65 .",
    "these latter values correspond approximately to the extremes of the mass distribution of the observed jupiter companions to hjs and wjs .",
    "we assume the orbits to be prograde and sample the mutual inclination from a uniform distribution in @xmath66 .",
    "we take the mutual inclination in the range @xmath67 to @xmath68 degrees .",
    "the high mutual orbital inclination is required in order for the inner planet to reach high eccentricities .",
    "we adopt a small initial eccentricity for the inner planet @xmath69 and take @xmath70 for the outer planet .",
    "this latter value is close to the median of the eccentricity distribution for the outer companion of observed hjs and wjs .",
    "the outer planet semi - major axis is sampled uniformly within @xmath71 with the lower limit set such that the system satisfied the stability condition of equation  ( [ pet+15 ] ) in the limit @xmath72 .",
    "we considered two values of the inner planet semi - major axis : @xmath73 , @xmath47 . for each value of @xmath42 we considered three values of the time - lag constant @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , which correspond to a tidal quality factor @xmath77 of @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively .",
    "thus , we evolved 6 sets of initial conditions . for each set we performed a total of 1000 random realizations integrating them up to a final integration time of @xmath59 .",
    "in addition to the secular integrations described above we run 3 sets of initial conditions ( corresponding to the three values of @xmath81 ) where we used a rayleigh distribution for both @xmath82 and @xmath83 with a mean eccentricity of 0.175 @xcite , and this time sampling @xmath84 such that the system satisfied the stability condition of equation ( [ ma01 ] ) . in these latter simulations ( models c in table  [ tb2 ] ) , the planets can have initially a lower @xmath85 ratio which favors the formation of wjs as discussed in section  [ s1 ] . as a consequence of this",
    ", such models are expected to produce more wjs than if we were to select the initial conditions based on inequality  ( [ pet+15 ] ) , however we caution that they also contain more systems that are near the orbit crossing when @xmath86 and for which the orbit - averaged treatment we use is less accurate",
    ".    table 2 gives the initial setup of the numerical integrations and summarizes the main results of our simulations , giving the fraction of systems that lead to the specified outcomes . in order to take into account the fact that we are only simulating systems with mutual inclinations larger than @xmath62 we reduced the number of forming hjs and wjs ( and disrupted ) by @xmath87 , and then used that number in the fraction .",
    "we find that a high-@xmath3 lk migration scenario is more efficient at producing hjs than wjs .",
    "the fraction of systems that result in the formation of wjs is @xmath88 of the total and it is roughly constant , having little variation with the initial conditions and tidal dissipation strength .",
    "the fact that the number of @xmath89 is not very sensitive to @xmath81 is because increasing @xmath81 will result in a larger number of planets migrating inside the period valley , but at the same time also in a larger number of planets leaving it . according to our results ,",
    "if wjs are migrating planets , then for a homogeneous sample of planets we we would expect that planets with detected outer companions would more often be hj s than wj s .",
    "this expectation appears to be at odds with what is observed . restricting our analysis to the subset of known extrasolar planets discovered by radial - velocity surveys , only 2 of the jupiter mass planets ( @xmath90 ) at @xmath91",
    "have a detected outer companion within @xmath92 distance from their host star , while 20 jupiters mass planets at @xmath93 do .",
    "this suggests that hjs and wjs belong to two distinct populations of planets which likely originated through different processes .",
    "figure [ hem - res ] shows the properties of outer companions to the observed hjs ( black points ) and wjs ( black stars ) .",
    "the black and red curves show the value of @xmath84 satisfying the condition equations  ( [ pet+15 ] ) and ( [ ma01 ] ) respectively .",
    "below these lines wjs are unlikely to form as the system is unstable to either collision or ejection of one of the planets .",
    "as done previously in section [ s1 ] we computed the stability limit from equations  ( [ pet+15 ] ) by taking the relevant limit @xmath33 . in figure [ hem - res ] the relative position of the black points to the stability lines show that only four of the twenty - four observed systems would be dynamically stable if the inner planet had @xmath73 , and fourteen of them would be on intersecting orbits .",
    "figure [ hem - res ] also displays the results from models a1 and a3 of table 2 , showing the systems that form hjs ( red points ) and those that form wjs ( red stars ) .",
    "these latter being defined as those systems in which the innermost planet had experienced significant tidal dissipation and migrated inside the semi - major axis range @xmath53 . from this figure",
    "we see again that the number of migrated planets that have formed a hj increases significantly when increasing the time - lag factor @xmath81 , while the number of migrating planets in the period valley ( red stars ) increases but only slightly .",
    "accordingly , the number of hjs formed in our models is typically equal or larger than the number of migrating wjs .    in the upper panel of figure",
    "[ a - e - distr ] we show the period distribution of migrating planets and compared this to the ( intrinsic ) observed distribution from @xcite . such comparison shows that the semi - major axis distribution of the planets in our simulations does not provide a good match to the observed period distribution of gas giants in the period valley .",
    "given the observed number of jupiters at @xmath94 , the models underpredict the number of migrating planets below this period by at least one order of magnitude .",
    "we conclude that a high-@xmath3 migration mechanism can be responsible for less than @xmath4 of all gas giants with orbital periods in the range @xmath95 .",
    "we note that our simulations are restricted to systems with inner planets initially at @xmath96 , accompanied by a outer perturber within @xmath97 . a significant contribution to",
    "the wj population from planets migrating from @xmath98 and having companions at @xmath99 is unlikely .",
    "in fact , as also noted in section [ s1 ] , wjs can not form for jupiter mass perturbers if @xmath84 is larger than a few aus .",
    "finally , we note that similar to previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our model distributions do not match the period distribution of hjs ( @xmath100 ) , producing too many planets at short orbital periods ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "such discrepancy might depend on the choice we made for various parameters , most importantly on the adopted value of the planet radius which determines the final semi - major axis of the hj @xcite .",
    "a secular migration model for wjs fails at explaining some additional features of the observed orbital distribution .",
    "first , in only three of the 3000 models that were started at @xmath54 the inner planet was found in the region @xmath102 by the end of the simulation .",
    "this is in contrast with the abundance of observed jovian planets at these radii and casts further doubts on a possible migratory origin from @xmath1 for these systems .",
    "if the planets started with a smaller semi - major axis @xmath56 , as shown in figure   [ a - e - distr ] then for each jupiter in the radial range @xmath55 our models produce at least ten more ( mostly non - migrating ) jupiters within the range @xmath103 .",
    "contrary to this , observations yield roughly the same number of giant planets in these two ranges of semi - major axes .    the lower panel of figure  [ a - e - distr ] shows the final @xmath104 vs @xmath3 distribution of the simulated systems compared to the observed distribution .",
    "this plot shows an additional important feature of the simulated distribution which is difficult to reconcile with observations : the lack of low-@xmath3 wjs at @xmath105 .",
    "in fact , none of our models produced a wj with @xmath106 at these radii , while @xmath107 of known planets with semi - major axis @xmath108 have eccentricities @xmath109 .",
    "evidently giant planets observed in this region of parameter space are unlikely to have formed through secular migration induced by an outer perturber planet .",
    "this latter point is further discussed in the next section .",
    "@xcite showed that eccentric wjs with eccentric outer giant companions have apsidal separations which cluster near @xmath110 .",
    "@xcite interpreted this as signature of mutual inclinations being between @xmath111 , favoring lk migration as the mechanism for the formation of the inner planets . in figure",
    "[ am - dis ] we show the distribution of the apsidal misalignment , @xmath112 , as a function of mutual inclination for the migrating wjs in our secular integrations .",
    "interestingly , our simulated planets do not show any significant clustering around @xmath113 .",
    "the wjs formed in our models have mutual inclinations in the range @xmath114 , but their @xmath115 appear to be uniformly distributed .",

    "hence the observed @xmath3-distribution provides no evidence for differences in the eccentricity distribution of wjs and jupiters outside @xmath12 that is expected on the basis of theoretical models .",
    "in addition , comparing the eccentricity distribution of all wjs with that of only wjs with one outer companion ( orange curve ) shows that these two distributions are not significantly different from each other .",
    "all these results point either to disk migration @xcite or to in - situ formation @xcite for the origin of wjs rather than secular migration processes such as the lk mechanism @xcite or secular chaos @xcite .",
    "we have considered the population of giant planets in the period valley .",
    "these planets , often referred to as wjs , have orbital periods larger than @xmath182 but are interior to the peak of giant planet frequency observed at @xmath183 @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that such planets might not be able to form in - situ . in a widely discussed model for the formation of these planets , large amplitude eccentricity oscillations induced by an external perturber",
    "are followed by efficient tidal dissipation which causes the orbit of the inner planet to shrink during close passages by the host star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    before summarizing our results",
    "we briefly address the importance of selection effects .",
    "in fact , when comparing the predictions of our models to observations we have so far neglected the fact that observations might be biased against for example orbits with high eccentricity and/or large semi - major axis .",
    "this might affect the inference of the intrinsic orbital distribution of the observed planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have considered mostly rv data from the exoplanets.org database .",
    "rv data might be biased against the detection of longer period planets , although this effect is likely to be small for the semi - major axis range considered here @xmath184 @xcite .",
    "more important might be the bias against the detection of eccentric planets which would affect the distributions of figure [ e - dis ] .",
    "in fact , the sparse sampling of an orbit with a high - eccentricity can miss the reflex velocity signal near periapsis , leading to non - detection of planets that would be detected at the same semi - major axis and lower eccentricity @xcite .",
    "we believe however that these effects should be relatively small since our sample is restricted to giant planets with relatively large masses ( @xmath185 ) and small semi - major axes ( @xmath37 ) , which should be relatively easy to detect .",
    "we note also that other studies which have taken into account such selection effects have reported results similar to ours , pointing out the excess of highly eccentric wjs predicted by high-@xmath3 scenarios compared to the observed distribution @xcite .",
    "we also note that we have limited the parameter space of our simulations by keeping the perturber mass within @xmath186 .",
    "however , the wjs for which there is no observational evidence for a jupiter companion might be migrating due to interactions with a distant stellar companion . @xcite and @xcite conducted octupole - level population synthesis studies of giant planets migrating through the lk mechanism due to a stellar companion and friction due to tides .",
    "although their initial conditions are different from ours , the fraction of migrating planets obtained in these studies and their orbital distribution are comparable to what is obtained in our study .",
    "for example , the fraction ( @xmath187 ) and orbits of migrating planets displayed in figure 10 of @xcite are clearly similar to those shown in our figure  [ a - e - distr ] .",
    "this suggests that while the perturber plays the fundamental role in inducing the planetary lk oscillations , the perturber properties are likely to not impact our general results .",
    "the main results of our paper should therefore apply also to the case in which the lk oscillations are induced by a stellar companion rather than an outer jovian companion .    in conclusion",
    "we have presented a numerical study of the dynamics of giant planets with close friends .",
    "we used both a secular code based on orbit average equations of motion as well as direct three body integrations to address whether the giant planets observed in the semi - major axis range @xmath5 could have been formed farther out and then migrated to these radii through secular migration processes such as lk cycles or secular chaos .",
    "the main results of our study are summarized below :    * according to the high-@xmath3 migration hypothesis , hjs and wjs formed originally at @xmath1 distance from their host star . in order to test this hypothesis we addressed whether the observed jupiter pairs hosting hjs and wjs would be dynamically stable if the inner planet was placed on an eccentric orbit ( as required for efficient tidal dissipation ) at @xmath1 . according to stability criteria that we have taken from the literature",
    ", only four of the twenty - four observed systems would be dynamically stable at these radii with fourteen of them being on intersecting orbits . as we also confirmed by direct integrations ,",
    "if a planet pairs is unstable , it does not lead to the formation of tidally migrating planets but rather to collisions with the host star or planet ejections .",
    "these findings point against a high-@xmath3 migration scenario from @xmath1 for the formation of most observed systems .",
    "* we showed that high-@xmath3 migration models for wjs produce a period distribution that is not consistent with observations . by comparing the ratio of wjs to cjs we found in our simulations to that ratio as observed",
    ", we infer that @xmath188 of all gas giants observed at @xmath5 from their stellar host could have formed through high-@xmath3 migration lk processes .",
    "preliminary simulations of systems containing three to five planets suggest that the fraction of wjs produced in multi - planet systems is likely to be small as well . *",
    "our analysis shows that high-@xmath3 migration processes tend to produce more hjs than wjs .",
    "accordingly , for any detected wj with a close companion there should be at least an equal amount of detected hjs also with a close companion .",
    "in contrast with this prediction , and restricting ourself to jupiters discovered through rv surveys , we find that only 2 hjs have a detected outer giant companion within @xmath189 , while 20 of the 74 period valley gas giants do .",
    "this points towards a different formation history for the two populations of planets . * using both numerical and analytic techniques",
    "we have shown that a tidal migration model produces an eccentricity distribution for the migrating planets that also appears to be inconsistent with observations .",
    "the oscillations required to produce inward migration tend to excite the eccentricities of migrating planets to values higher than those observed .",
    "* we showed that the observed eccentricity distribution of giant planets in the radial range @xmath5 is consistent with the eccentricity distribution for planets at radii larger than @xmath190 .",
    "this might indicate a close relation between the two populations of planets and perhaps a common formation history .",
    "based on these results , we conclude that rather than starting on highly - eccentric orbits with orbital periods above 1 year , the jupiters observed in the radial range @xmath5 from their stellar host are likely to have reached the region where they are observed today without tidal circularization .",
    "tidal migration following planet - planet scattering is also disfavored given that we would not expect it to typically result in close and mildly eccentric companions to wjs @xcite .    where do the wjs come from then ?",
    "our results may indicate that disk migration is the dominant channel for producing wjs .",
    "alternatively , they might have formed in - situ @xcite , i.e. , they underwent runaway gas accretion , from originally low - mass closely packed planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , both disk migration and in - situ formation are more likely to produce planets on nearly circular and low inclined orbits , so it remains to be explained how in these scenarios the planets eccentricities could have been excited to the observed values .",
    "a possibility is that the eccentricities were excited through secular chaos @xcite , which could imply the presence of one or multiple still undetected planet companions to the numerous planet pairs observed in the period valley . of the warm jupiters , a fraction twice as large as the upper limit found here . ]",
