    "to date , more than 1400 exoplanets have been discovered .",
    "most of them were mainly detected by the radial velocity @xcite and the transit @xcite techniques .",
    "the former method is based on the detection of periodic doppler shifts in the stellar spectral lines due to the movement of the star around the star - planet barycenter .",
    "the second one is based upon the detection of periodic variations of the stellar flux produced by the passage of a planet in front of the stellar disk . in the last years ,",
    "a new technique became very popular to search for planets : the transit timing variations or ttvs @xcite . in a system composed only by a star and a transiting planet , one should expect that the interval between successive minima be constant .",
    "however , if there is a third body in the system , periodic variations of this interval are anticipated .",
    "therefore , it should be possible to detect other planetary - mass bodies around stars with an already known transiting planet . the less massive the perturber , the smaller",
    "the amplitudes of the timing variations , and the higher precision minimum central times ( with errors of around seconds ) are required .",
    "many factors have to be taken into account to reach realistic conclusions about ttvs : sampling of the observations @xcite , quality of the light curves , presence of red noise @xcite , variable atmospheric conditions during the night ( for ground - base observations ) , etc .",
    "in addition , as it has been shown in several studies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for ttv analysis it is of crucial relevance to perform the same fitting procedure and error treatment in the transits studied .    on the other hand",
    ", there is evidence suggesting that the probability of finding gas giant planets around main - sequence stars is an increasing function of the stellar metallicity , reaching only 3% for stars with subsolar metallicity @xcite . with a @xmath3 } = -0.29\\ \\mathrm{dex}$ ] , the f8 star wasp-28 @xcite seems to fall in the metal - poor long tail of the metallicity distribution of the planet - host stars .",
    "the planet around this star , wasp-28b , discovered by the superwasp program @xcite , is a hot jupiter - like planet ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) describing a prograde and aligned orbit .",
    "the age of the system ( @xmath7 gyr ) suggests the possibility that the current orbit of the planet could be reached by planet - disc migration or via tidal interaction although , if the last possibility is assumed , the fact that the planet had not fallen into the star remains unexplained . in this sense , it becomes relevant the study of ttvs to understand the dynamic history of the system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in a recent work , @xcite conclude that , in contrast to the presence of transit timing variations in systems with long - period jupiters , hot - neptunes and hot - earths , the absence of ttvs in hot - jupiter systems might indicate different planet formation and dynamical evolution theories .",
    "the authors suggest that the main mechanism responsable for the formation of hot - jupiters could be the planet - planet scattering .    in this work we carried on a complete and homogeneous study of ttvs and looked for variations in the photometric parameters of wasp-28b .",
    "we considered the influence of many factors related to the quality of the studied light - curves to explain the high dispersions found in the long - term behaviour of the parameters .",
    "finally , we investigated whether the low metallicity of wasp-28 can be due to its galatic population membership , through the calculation of its galactic spatial velocities .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section  [ sec.obs ]",
    "we present our observations and data reduction . in section  [ sec.par ]",
    "we describe the procedure used to fit the light - curves and to derive the photometric and physical parameters . in section  [ sec.var ] we discuss the long - term variations of the parameters and calculate the relation between them and different factors that characterize the light - curves . in section  [ sec.eph ]",
    "we carry out a ttvs study of the system and calculate new ephemeris . in section  [ sec.uvw ]",
    "we describe the kinematic properties of wasp-28 and discuss possible scenarios for the formation of its hot jupiter in a metal - poor environment . finally , in section ",
    "[ sec.con ] we present the conclusions .",
    "the 4 transits of wasp-28b were observed between august 2011 and october 2013 .",
    "the observations were carried out with the telescope horacio ghielmetti ( thg ) located at cerro bureck in the complejo astronmico el leoncito ( san juan , argentina ) .",
    "this telescope is a remotely - operated meade - rcx 400 with a 40-cm primary mirror and johnson ubvri filters .",
    "the transit corresponding to 2012 , july 26 was observed using an apogee alta u8300 camera with 3326@xmath82504 5@xmath9 pixels , with a scale of 0.32``/pix and a 19@xmath814 field of view .",
    "the remaining ones were observed employing an apogee alta u16 m camera with 4096@xmath84096 9@xmath9 pixels , resulting in a scale of 0.57''/pix and a 49@xmath849 field of view .",
    "for the transit of 2013 october 26 , the images were strongly defocused to minimize the dispersion of the resulting transit . after testing different bin sizes and filters",
    ", we decided to use a bin of 2@xmath82 to achieve a better temporal resolution .",
    "we adopted integration times ranging from 10 to 120 sec depending on seeing , airmass conditions and the selected filter . in table",
    "[ table:1 ] we present a log of the observations .    before every observation",
    "the computer clock was automatically synchronized with the gps time signal , to be certain that the times of all the images were expressed in heliocentric julian date based on coordinated universal time ( @xmath10 ) . for each night",
    ", we took 10 bias and 8 dark frames .",
    "we averaged all the biases and median combined the bias - corrected darks .",
    "we employed the standard iraf tasks to perform bias and dark correction .",
    "we did not perform the flat - fielding correction to the images , since we found that it introduced unwanted errors .",
    "all the instrumental magnitudes were obtained with the fotomcc pipeline @xcite , which employs aperture photometry choosing the optimal annulus through the growth - curves technique @xcite .",
    "once the instrumental magnitudes were obtained , we carried out the differential photometry .",
    "as one of the purposes of this work is to study ttvs , we decided to include all other transits publicly available . besides ours , we employed 11 light - curves published in the exoplanet transit database ( etd[multiblock footnote omitted ] ) .",
    "we considered only those where the transits were clearly visible .",
    "the smooth trends present in the light - curves are mainly originated by differences between the spectral types of the comparison and the exoplanet host - star , differential extinction and , occasionally , by stellar activity . to remove these trends , for each light - curve we selected the before - ingress and after - egress data - points and fitted a second order legendre polynomial . only in a few cases",
    "a first order polynomial was applied .",
    "then , we removed the fit from all the data ( including transit points ) and normalized the out - of - transit ( oot ) data to unit .",
    "we derived fundamental stellar parameters and metallicity ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , [ fe / h ] ) for wasp-28 using harps archival spectra .",
    "a total of 33 individual spectra were co - added to produce a single spectrum with an average signal - to - noise of around 100:1 , suitable for spectroscopic analysis .",
    "these four quantities were derived in lte using the fundpar fortran code @xcite .",
    "this program determines fundamental parameters from a list of fe lines equivalent widths , using the 2010 version of the moog code @xcite , and calculates kurucz atlas plane - parallel model atmospheres .",
    "equivalent widths for 27 fe i and 12 fe ii weak and isolated lines were measured automatically using the ares code @xcite .",
    "the resulting values obtained from the analysis are : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath3}=-0.2 \\pm 0.07\\ \\mathrm{dex}$ ] .",
    "these results agree with the values of the fundamental parameters published by @xcite",
    ". however , our uncertainties in @xmath11 and @xmath12 are much smaller than those calculated by @xcite , probably due to the different method used to compute these parameters .",
    "we calculated theoretical limb - darkening coefficients with the program jktld by bilinear interpolation of the effective temperature and surface gravity using the tabulations of @xcite , which were built employing kurucz atlas9 atmospheric models .",
    "as these tabulations do not provide theoretical limb - darkening coefficients for the johnson - r filter , for those transits observed in this band we adopted the values tabulated for the cousin - r filter . for the light - curves obtained with no filter , we took the average of the values corresponding to the johnson - v and cousin - r bands .",
    "we used the jktebop code to fit all the light - curves .",
    "this code assumes that the star and the planet have biaxial ellipsoid projections and computes the light - curve considering concentric circles over each component .",
    "for each transit , initially we assumed as adjusted parameters the inclination ( @xmath0 ) , the sum of the fractional radii ( @xmath17 ) and the ratio of the fractional radii ( @xmath18 ) . here ,",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 represent the ratios of the absolute radii of the star and the exoplanet , respectively , to the semimajor axis ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "we also took as free parameters the mid - transit time ( @xmath22 ) and the scale factor ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we adopted as initial parameters for the iteration those determined by @xcite .",
    "we calculated @xmath1 and @xmath24 employing the values of @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath21 computed in the same paper .",
    "as in @xcite every light - curve was fitted with four different limb darkening laws : linear , quadratic , logarithmic and square - root .",
    "for each law , we tried three different possibilities : 1 ) both coefficients fixed , 2 ) the linear coefficient fitted and the nonlinear fixed and , 3 ) both coefficients fitted . finally , we adopted as the best model for a given light - curve the one with minimum @xmath27 and realistic values for the adjusted parameters . to get @xmath28 , we multiplied the photometric errors by the square - root of the reduced chi - squared of the fit . finally , since the levenberg - marquardt optimization algorithm we employed to get the best - fitting model only computes formal errors for the adjusted parameters , we ran two other tasks implemented in jktebop : monte carlo simulations ( for which we took 10000 iterations ) and the residual permutation ( rp ) algorithm which takes the presence of red noise into account .",
    "we assumed the median value of the empirical data as the final value of each parameter ( except for @xmath29 , see section  [ sec.eph ] ) , and its error was conservatively adopted as the largest value obtained for both tasks . in fig .",
    "1 we show the 15 transits and the best fit to the data and in table [ table:2 ] we list the photometric parameters determined for each light - curve .",
    "to obtain realistic results , we considered only the values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath24 obtained from the high quality and complete light - curves of our sample . a way to evaluate the light - curve quality",
    "is to calculate the photometric noise rate ( pnr ) . in @xcite",
    "this parameter is defined as : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the standard deviation of the light - curve residuals and @xmath32 is the median number of exposures ( including not only the exposure time but also the readout time ) per minute . in our case , we considered as the best quality light - curves those with pnr lower than 5 mmag .",
    "then , taking into account only the values of the photometric parameters of these complete and high quality transits ( 5 points ) , we computed the values and errors of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath24 as the weighted average and the standard deviation of the sample , respectively .",
    "the final estimations of these parameters are :    @xmath33    although jktebop gives less certain but still useful results when light - curves are incomplete , to determine how well the levenberg - marquardt optimization algorithm explores the parameter space for partial transits , we tested the influence of the initial parameters in the final results .",
    "therefore , for the 8 incomplete transits of our sample we computed the photometric parameters adopting as initial values those published by @xcite @xmath34 3 times the error , @xmath1 and @xmath24 we considered as errors those calculated through the 5 best light - curves . for @xmath23 and the limb - darkening coefficients we assumed 0.001 and 0.01 , respectively . ] , alternatively .",
    "in the first case we named the final parameters @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the latter case . in table 3 , we show the differences between the parameters listed in table 2 and those obtained as we explained before . except for the transits of the epochs 160 and 367 ,",
    "all the differences remain within the errors .",
    "the two outliers correspond to the poorest - quality light - curves according to the factor pnr ( see column 8 of table 2 ) . *",
    "these results indicate that , because the transit equation is non linear , the levenberg - marquardt algorithm can be trapped in a local minimum ( which may not be the global minimum ) and hence , might not correctly explore the parameter space . *      to determine the physical parameters we employed the jktabsdim code .",
    "this code uses standard formulae @xcite to calculate the absolute dimensions of a system with two components , from the results of radial velocity and light - curve analysis . as input",
    ", it requires the photometric quantities ( @xmath0 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) obtained in the previous section , the orbital period ( @xmath43 ) determined from the ephemeris , the stellar velocity amplitude ( @xmath44 ) , for which we adopted the value given by @xcite , the eccentricity , for which we assumed a circular orbit ( @xmath45 ) , the velocity amplitude of the planet ( @xmath46 ) , and the corresponding errors and @xmath47 . ] .    the value chosen for @xmath46 was the one which minimizes the figure of merit :    @xmath48 ^ 2+\\bigg[\\frac{t^{\\mathrm{(obs)}}_{\\mathrm{eff}}-t^{\\mathrm{(calc)}}_{\\mathrm{eff}})}{\\sigma(t^{\\mathrm{(obs)}}_{\\mathrm{eff}})}\\bigg]^2,\\ ] ]    where the predicted radius ( @xmath49 ) and effective temperature ( @xmath50 ) of the star",
    "were determined by linearly interpolating the calculated stellar mass and [ fe / h]=-0.2\\ \\mathrm{dex}$ ] , determined in the previous section .",
    "] within tabulated theoretical models . to avoid any dependence of the resulting parameters with the employed stellar - model we performed this analysis for 3 different tabulated models : @xmath51 @xcite , padova @xcite and teramo @xcite",
    "for each one , we considered series of isochrones bracketing the lifetime of the star in the main - sequence . in this way , it was possible to estimate the age of the system .",
    "we adopted as final value for @xmath46 the average of the amplitudes given by each model , and for the velocity error we used the standard deviation .",
    "therefore , by applying this procedure , we obtained @xmath52 , @xmath25 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath26 , @xmath21 and age .    for completeness , we calculated the exoplanet surface gravity with @xcite :    @xmath55    and the modified equilibrium temperature @xcite as :    @xmath56    assuming that the planetary albedo is zero . in table 4",
    "we present our results .",
    "the final values for the physical properties and their errors were calculated considering the photometric parameters determined in section  [ bozomath1 ] , which were computed from the best 5 light - curves .",
    "all these parameters are in good agreement , within errors , with the values reported in the discovery paper by @xcite .",
    "since the presence of a perturber ( moon or another planet ) could produce periodic variations of the depth and/or inclination , in fig .",
    "2 we show the long - term behaviour of these parameters . it can be seen that in both cases there are points which apart more than @xmath34 1@xmath57 from the mean value .",
    "we computed the lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite to see if there are any periodicities which could be attributed to the presence of a perturber , but we did not find any significant peak . to discern the origin of these dispersions we studied the correlation between the photometric parameters and different factors related to the quality of the light - curves .",
    "we investigated if the lack of transit points influences the adjusted parameters . in fig .",
    "3 we indicate with empty symbols the incomplete transits and in filled symbols the complete ones .",
    "it can be seen in table [ table:5 ] that the distributions overlap and the median values are similar within an error of @xmath58 .",
    "this means that , even in the absence of some points in the light - curves , we should expect reliable values for the adjusted parameters i and k. * however , this result could be contaminated by other factors ( such as white and/or red noises ) and most importantly , as we showed in section  [ bozomath1 ] , for partial transits the levenberg - marquardt algorithm might not correctly explore the parameter space . in this sense",
    ", our conclusion agrees with the one found by recent works @xcite which show that incomplete transits could affect the values and errors of the system parameters obtained from these light - curves .",
    "therefore in the following subsections we exclude partial transits from our analysis . *",
    "+      @xcite show in fig 11 how observations of transits with low impact parameters , taken in filters with @xmath59 can increase the depth of the transit up to 25@xmath60 .",
    "since wasp-28 has @xmath61 and half of the transits studied in this work were observed with no filter and half in the r - band , we analysed if there is a correlation between the measured depth and the employed filter . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "3 we show with red circles the transits observed in the r - filter and in blue triangles those observed with no filter ( and one in the b - band ) . to determine if both datasets represent the same population we calculated the median and @xmath62 of the samples ( see table [ table:4 ] ) only using complete transits .",
    "we could not make a kolmogorov - smirnov test because the number of data in both samples is lower than 10 . by performing a visual inspection and considering the data in table [ table:4 ]",
    ", we concluded that there is no evident trend and both distributions overlap .",
    "this can be interpreted as that the band in which the transits were observed has no influence in the final @xmath1 values . in the upper panel of fig .",
    "3 , it can be noticed that the same conclusion is reached regarding the inclination , @xmath0 .",
    "+      this is the noise produced by systematic errors due to changes in atmospheric conditions , airmass , telescope tracking , relative flat field errors , or a combination of all these factors .",
    "it can also be caused by the intrinsic variability of the targets .",
    "the presence of red noise in the data implies that adjacent data points in a light - curve are correlated @xcite .",
    "although it is not completely well understood , the existence of this kind of noise leads to an underestimation of the errors in the adjusted parameters , resulting in an inaccurate determination of them .",
    "red noise can be quantified with the factor @xmath63 , defined by @xcite . here , @xmath64 is obtained by averaging the residuals into m bins of n points and calculating the standard deviation of the binned residuals , and @xmath65 is the expected standard deviation , calculated by :    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the standard deviation of the unbinned residuals . in our case , to estimate the parameter @xmath2 , we considered that the duration of the ingress / egress of the wasp-28b transits is around 20 minutes , and we averaged the residuals in bins of between 10 and 30 minutes .",
    "finally , we used the median value as the red noise factor corresponding to that light - curve . in column 7 of table [ table:2 ] , we show the values obtained . since in the absence of red noise @xmath68 , we see that in almost all transits white noise predominates .",
    "in the lower panel of fig .",
    "4 we show the variation of depth with @xmath2 for complete transits . the red continuous line represents the best linear fit to the data obtained through weighted least - squares . as it can be seen , there is a weak positive correlation indicating that noisier observations result in larger depths . considering all the points , @xmath69 , but if we exclude the transit with @xmath70 , @xmath71 increases to 0.577 .",
    "this figure seems to suggest that observations with large red noise would lead to an overestimation of the planetary radius .    in the upper panel of fig .",
    "4 , we plot the variation of @xmath0 with the red noise .",
    "contrary to what occurs with @xmath1 , the correlation between these parameters is almost zero ( @xmath72 ) , indicating that the values of the inclination are not influenced by the presence of red noise .",
    "5 shows the variation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 with pnr for complete transits . in the lower panel",
    "we present @xmath1 vs pnr .",
    "it can be seen that there is a correlation ( @xmath73 ) , similar to the one found for @xmath2 , which indicates that low - quality data can result in overestimations of the planetary radius for a given value of the stellar radius . on the other hand , the values of @xmath0",
    "are slightly anticorrelated ( @xmath74 ) with pnr , showing that noisy transits could lead to underestimations of the values of the inclination .",
    "as the minimum central times are uncorrelated with the rest of the parameters , we fitted each one of the 15 individual transit light curves considering @xmath22 as the only adjusted parameter . for the fixed parameters we adopted the final values obtained in section  [ bozomath1 ] .",
    "we used the @xcite on - line converter to transform the times of all the observations to @xmath75 ( barycentric julian date based on barycentric dynamical time ) .",
    "we assumed that the @xmath29 have a gaussian distribution , and therefore we adopted for the mid - transit times the mean values and the symmetric errors ( @xmath58 ) given by the best fit to the light - curves . as we explained in section  [ sec.par ] , the errors considered are the largest between the estimated by monte carlo and by the rp algorithms .    in table",
    "[ table:6 ] we present the mid transit times computed for all the light - curves .",
    "if we include all the 15 points into the analysis , we find a @xmath76 which seems to suggest the possibility of variations in the data .",
    "however , as it can be noted in fig .",
    "6 , there are 5 outliers that strongly deviate from the rest of data .",
    "all of these correspond to incomplete transits ( magenta triangles ) .",
    "@xcite show that in a large percentage of cases , the mid - times of partial transits are unrealistic .",
    "they attribute this to the fact that a lack of points in the oot data affects the symmetry of the light - curve and hence the central transit times , due to an incorrect normalisation . on the other hand ,",
    "the points of the epochs 159 , 358 and 367 correspond to transits with high level of red noise ( all of them with @xmath77 ) , while the ones corresponding to the epochs 160 , 358 and 367 belong to low quality light - curves .",
    "@xcite show that the inclusion of big outliers can lead to false conclusions about the existence of ttvs .",
    "taking all this into account we decided to exclude all partial transits from our analysis to sure that they are not biasing the results . to calculate the best period ( @xmath43 ) and the minimum reference time ( @xmath78 ) , we fitted a linear model to the 7 remaining data through weighted least - squares .",
    "the new ephemeris obtained are : @xmath79    where @xmath80 and @xmath81 . here",
    "@xmath82 represents the epoch .",
    "the uncertainties were obtained from the covariance matrix of the fit and were re - scaled multiplying them by @xmath83 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath84 , implying that the measurements agree with a linear ephemeris and there is no evident periodic variations in the o - c diagram . as it is shown in fig .",
    "6 , the point corresponding to the epoch 382 is outside the area between the @xmath85 dashed lines .",
    "we can not explain the cause of this anomalous value .",
    "since the version of the jktebop code employed in this work ( version 28 ) does not permit to normalise the out - of - transit data - points and to fit the light - curves simultaneously , both processes were carried out separately .",
    "however , recent works @xcite have noticed that the measured transit - times would correlate with the normalisation function , suggesting that the normalisation parameters should be taken into account during the fitting procedure .    for completeness , we investigated the mass of a possible perturber , considering different orbital configurations . to do that",
    ", we assumed an external perturbing body whose semimajor axis is much greater than that of the transiting planet and used the eq .",
    "( 2 ) from @xcite : @xmath86    where , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the orbital periods of wasp-28b and the perturber , respectively , @xmath52 is the stellar mass , @xmath89 is the eccentricity of the perturber and @xmath90 represents the variations in the interval between successive transits . for @xmath87 and @xmath52",
    ", we assumed the values obtained in previous sections and for @xmath90 we adopted 3.6 minutes , which is the standard deviation of the 7 points considered to do the ttv analysis .",
    "for the perturber , we tested the following values for the eccentricity : 0 , 0.001 , 0.01 , 0.05 , 0.1 and 0.25 and semimajor axes from 0.08 to 0.35 au with step 0.01 . in fig .",
    "7 we showed the results obtained . for clarity",
    ", we cut the graph in @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "if we consider a very eccentric orbit for the perturber ( @xmath93 ) and a semimajor axis almost the double of the semimajor axis of the transiting planet ( @xmath94 ) , our ttvs precision would permit to set the maximum mass of an undetected perturber in more than half of the saturn mass ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "under the supposition that the perturbing body has a circular orbit ( @xmath45 ) and ( @xmath94 ) , its mass would be half of the jupiter mass .",
    "we also investigated the masses of possible external perturbers located in the positions of first - order mean - motion resonances with wasp-28b .",
    "we employed the eq .",
    "( 33 ) from @xcite : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the number of orbits between conjunctions .",
    "we calculated the values of @xmath90 for the first - order resonances 2:1 , 3:2 , 4:3 and 5:4 , ranging the mass of the perturber from 1 @xmath98 to 10 @xmath99 with step 0.001 .",
    "considering our ttvs dispersion , the results permit to rule out the presence of a perturber with a mass greater than 1.9 , 2.8 , 3.8 and 4.7 @xmath98 at the 2:1 , 3:2 , 4:3 and 5:4 resonances with wasp-28b .",
    "it is important to notice that this is just a first approximation and a more rigorous analysis of the resonances , employing equations of motion , should be done in order to obtain more precise results .",
    "in order to establish the galaxy population membership of the metal - poor star wasp-28 , we computed its kinematic properties . the galactic - velocity components ( @xmath100,@xmath101,@xmath102 ) and their errors",
    "were calculated following the methodology described in sections iii and iv of @xcite .",
    "we assumed the same directions for @xmath101 and @xmath102 , but for the @xmath100-component we supposed the opposite direction to the one adopted in that paper . to do the calculation",
    ", we used as initial quantities : @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the values of @xmath109 and @xmath110 were taken from @xcite , the radial velocity was calculated from the same harps spectra employed to determine the photometric parameters , whereas the rest of the parameters were taken from @xcite .",
    "the parallax ( @xmath111 ) was calculated from the value of distance published in that paper .",
    "the final space - velocity components were derived relative to the local standard of rest assuming a solar motion of @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "the resulting values for wasp-28 are : @xmath113,@xmath114,@xmath115 . based on these velocities we investigated the galactic population membership of wasp-28 considering the probabilities that the star belongs to the thick or thin disk or the halo ( @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 ) . to compute these probabilities , we employed the eq .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of @xcite obtaining the following values : @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , which suggest that wasp-28 is a thin disk star . therefore",
    ", this star might have been formed in some of the metal - poor clouds of the local neighborhood .    in the last years",
    "several works @xcite have discussed the scenario for the formation of planets around metal - poor stars ( or planets in the low metallicity tail of the planet - metallicity correlation ) , like wasp-28 . in the core accretion model",
    "@xcite a threshold density of solid material in the protoplanetary disk is necessary for a rapid growth of planetesimals .",
    "once a massive enough core is formed , it can accrete an atmosphere forming a gas - giant planet which can migrate close to the star , before the gas dissipates .",
    "this model is strongly dependent on the metallicity of the cloud @xcite .",
    "this means that the larger the metallicity the faster the formation of the giant planet , giving it enough time to migrate to distances less than @xmath122 .",
    "but , if the metallicity of the disk is low , the growth of planetesimals is slower .",
    "therefore , when the giant planet is completly formed , much of the gas near the star is already dissipated , and the recently formed planet can not migrate too close to the star . therefore , protoplanetary disks with low metallicity would have a scarce probability of forming hot jupiters .",
    "however , @xcite showed that high - mass stars would have massive protoplanetary disks .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite showed that giant planet formation can take place in protoplanetary disks with low metallicity and high mass . in this scenario ,",
    "the required limit of metal content to form a jupiter - like planet would be lower for disks around high - mass stars than for disks surrounding less massive stars .",
    "@xcite also showed that giant - planet frequency is an increasing function of not only the metallicity but also the stellar mass , and hence of the mass of the disk . in this scenario ,",
    "the stellar mass would compensate the protoplanetary - disk low metallicity , allowing the formation of jupiter - like planets ( * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . as it was noted by @xcite and @xcite if the disk mass increases , then the surface density of the protoplanetary disk increases , favoring the formation of gas giant planets in the core accretion model .",
    "another possibility is the gravitational - instability model of @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed this mechanism to explain the formation of giant planets before the dissipation of gas in the disk . in this scenario ,",
    "if the protoplanetary disk is massive enough , it could break up in dense fragments .",
    "tipically , in several hundreds of years these fragments would contract to form giant proto - planets . in this situation ,",
    "the planets form quickly , before the gas depletion .",
    "contrary to the core - accretion theory , this model is almost independent on [ fe / h ] . furthermore , @xcite and @xcite pointed out that the efficiency of the formation of giant planets through disk instability decreases as the metallicity increases .",
    "considering that wasp-28 is an intermediate - mass star , we can assume that its protoplanetary disk was of intermediate mass .",
    "in this scenario , both models could explain the origin of wasp-28b . on one hand , if the planet was formed through the core accretion model , the low - metallicity disk could have been compensated by the required density of solid material provided by the mass in the disk .",
    "if the planet was formed by boss model , the abundant mass of the protoplanetary disk would have been enough to allow the fragmentation and consecutive collapse of the resulting proto - planets .",
    "in this work we presented observations of 4 new transits of the system wasp-28 , observed between august 2011 and october 2013 . additionally , we also studied 11 transits reported by other observers , which were downloaded from the exoplanet transit database .",
    "we performed an homogeneous study of the 15 transits , and obtained new ephemeris and redetermined the parameters of the system .",
    "to look for evidence of another planetary - mass body present in the system , we analysed the long - term variations of @xmath0 and @xmath123 , finding large scattering in some points but without evidence of a periodic pattern .",
    "we found a weak anticorrelation between the noise of the observations ( measured by pnr ) and the @xmath0 measured in the transit , indicating that the inclination measured in noisy transits could be underestimated .",
    "for @xmath123 , we found a possible correlation with red noise and pnr , which would suggest that noisy light - curves , would lead to overestimate the planetary radius for a given value of @xmath124 .",
    "however it is important to caution that these relations are based on a small number of points ( @xmath125 ) and a statistically significant sample is needed to confirm these trends .",
    "we performed the first ttv analysis of this system .",
    "we found that the @xmath126 are well fitted by a linear ephemeris , with the exception of several outliers , which correspond to incomplete transits and very noisy observations .",
    "therefore , we found no evidence of the presence of another body in the system .    on the other hand",
    ", the dynamical analysis showed that for our ttvs precision the maximum mass that a perturber could have is @xmath127 @xmath128 , considering an eccentric orbit .",
    "however , if the orbit of the perturber is circular the maximum mass should be of @xmath129 @xmath128 . in the case of 2:1 ,",
    "3:2 , 4:3 and 5:4 first - order resonances we found that our data permit to exclude a external perturber with mass greater than 1.9 , 2.8 , 3.8 and 4.7 @xmath98 respectively .",
    "finally , we performed the first study of the kinematic properties of wasp-28 .",
    "we measured the components of the galactic velocity ( @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 ) and found that there is a probability of @xmath133 that the star belongs to the thin disk .",
