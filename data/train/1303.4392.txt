    "<S> star - forming galaxies display a continuous distribution of specific star formation rates ( ssfr ) which , in the simplest approximation , can be reproduced by the superposition of two log - normal distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the first of these encompasses the main sequence of star - forming galaxies , the second one a rarer population of starbursting systems . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the ssfr - distribution of starbursts can be regarded as the result of a physical process ( plausibly major mergers ) that takes the mathematical form of a log - normal boosting kernel and that enhances star formation activity . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we explore the utility of splitting the star - forming population into main - sequence and starburst galaxies  an approach we term ` 2-star formation mode ' ( 2-sfm ) framework  for understanding their molecular gas properties . </S>",
    "<S> we show that variations of star formation efficiency ( sfe ) and gas fractions among star - forming galaxies take a very simple , redshift - independent form , once these quantities are normalized to the characteristic value of an average , massive main - sequence galaxy . the change in sfe for galaxies undergoing a </S>",
    "<S> starburst event scales supra - linearly with the sfr - increase , as expected for merging events . </S>",
    "<S> this implies a continuous distribution of galaxies in the schmidt - kennicutt plane that separates more clearly into loci for starbursts and normal galaxies than observed in a plot of ( s)sfr vs. @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> starbursts with the largest deviations ( @xmath110-fold ) from the main sequence , like many local ulirgs , are not average starbursts , but even rarer events with progenitors having larger gas fractions than typical main - sequence galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we statistically infer that the gas fractions of typical starbursts are reduced by a factor of two to three with respect to their direct main - sequence progenitors , as expected to occur in short - term sfr - boosts during which internal gas reservoirs are drained more quickly than gas is accreted from the cosmic web . </S>",
    "<S> we predict variations of the co - to - h@xmath2 conversion factor @xmath3  in the sfr-@xmath0  plane and provide strong evidence that the higher ssfr of distant galaxies is a direct consequence of the higher gas fraction of these systems . </S>"
