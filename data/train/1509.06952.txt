    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    interacting quantum systems exhibit many interesting features during temporal evolution .",
    "these include diverse nonclassical effects such as quantum entanglement , revival phenomena @xcite , collapse of the measure of entanglement to a constant value over certain time intervals , and so on .",
    "atom optics provides a convenient framework for examining these effects . in tripartite",
    "entangled systems comprising an atom interacting with two radiation fields , further effects can occur , such as electromagnetically - induced transparency ( eit ) : the appearance , under suitable conditions , of a transparency window within the absorption spectrum of the atomic system . apart from the change in the transmission coefficient , atomic media can also exhibit interesting dispersive properties as a consequence of eit .",
    "this feature has been exploited to create materials that demonstrate slow light - pulse propagation and enhanced nonlinear optical properties ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "extensive experimental investigations on eit have been carried out on three - level atoms interacting with a probe field and a coupling field .",
    "following the report on the occurrence of eit in optically opaque sr@xmath1 vapour in 1991 @xcite , several detailed experiments have been performed on the nature of this optical phenomenon in various atom - field configurations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the absence of the coupling field",
    ", the intensity of the probe field ( equivalently , the corresponding mean photon number ) will remain nearly constant over a small range of values of the detuning parameter about zero . the transparency window created by the coupling field in this absorption spectrum",
    "is signalled by the appearance of a peak in the probe field intensity .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect that , if the entangled tripartite system displays collapses and revivals of the probe intensity during time evolution , this peak should be seen at any instant lying in a time interval in which the mean photon number of the probe field collapses to a constant value in the absence of the coupling field .    in tripartite systems comprising a v - type or @xmath0-type atom and two radiation fields ,",
    "the inclusion of kerr - type nonlinearities in the field subsystem opens up the possibility of collapses and revivals of the mean photon number corresponding to either field , under specific conditions .",
    "eit can therefore be investigated , for instance , at an instant in a time interval when the mean photon number collapses for the first time , independent of whether or not further collapses occur . on",
    "longer time scales the subsystem von neumann entropy ( svne ) corresponding to the atom can collapse to a constant value over a sufficiently long time interval and this feature could possibly be mirrored in the temporal evolution of the mean photon number of a field subsystem .",
    "further , the manner in which different initial field states , detuning parameters and interaction strengths affect both eit and the entanglement dynamics on long time scales needs to be examined .",
    "both @xmath0 and v atoms interacting with a probe field and a coupling field are good candidates for theoretical and experimental investigations of all the foregoing aspects .",
    "the revival phenomenon is exhibited even by a single - mode radiation field propagating in a kerr - like medium , governed by an effective hamiltonian of the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the photon annihilation and creation operators@xcite .",
    "fractional revivals occur at specific instants between two successive revivals of the initial wave packet , when the initial wave packet splits into two or more similar copies of itself @xcite .",
    "signatures of revivals and fractional revivals are captured by appropriate quadrature observables and their higher moments @xcite . collapses and revivals",
    "are of greater interest , however , in bipartite and multipartite systems that involve interaction between the subsystems , entailing nontrivial entanglement dynamics .",
    "a bipartite model@xcite of a multi - level atom interacting with a single - mode radiation field predicts@xcite collapses and revivals of the state of the field ( also reflected , in this case , in the temporal behaviour of the field svne ) , when the nonlinearity in the atomic medium is weak compared to the strength of atom - field interaction . for stronger nonlinearity , however , the revival phenomenon is absent ; a detailed time - series analysis of the mean photon number reveals a gamut of ergodicity properties displayed by this observable , ranging from regular to chaotic behaviour@xcite .",
    "entanglement dynamics in the foregoing bipartite model turns out to depend significantly on the degree to which the initial state of the field departs from perfect coherence .",
    "this has been deduced by selecting , as initial field states , the family of photon - added coherent states ( pacs)@xcite denoted by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 . the standard oscillator coherent state ( cs ) @xmath8 corresponds to the case @xmath9 , while the @xmath10-photon - added coherent state @xmath5 is obtained by normalising the state @xmath11 to unity .",
    "the set @xmath12 provides a family of states whose departure from coherence is precisely quantifiable .",
    "experimental realisation of the single photon - added coherent state using quantum state tomography @xcite has added to the relevance of these studies .",
    "if the atom has only a very small number of energy levels , the dynamics of entanglement differs both qualitatively and quantitatively from that of the bipartite model discussed above .",
    "this aspect has been studied@xcite in the framework of a three - level v or @xmath0 atom interacting with a single - mode radiation field .",
    "a striking feature is that , relatively independent of the degree of coherence of the initial state of the radiation field , the photon number statistics and the degree of entanglement are affected strongly by the low dimensionality of the atomic hilbert space .",
    "this feature continues to hold good for tripartite extensions of the model in which the atom interacts with two radiation fields .",
    "this tripartite model is most suitable for our present purposes , as it provides a convenient framework for examining eit , both on short time scales when the mean photon number records its first collapse , and on longer time scales where the measure of entanglement between the atom and fields remains constant over a significant time interval @xcite , for appropriate choices of the field state and parameter values .",
    "another important aspect we study is the role played by intensity - dependent couplings in entanglement dynamics .",
    "it has been found @xcite that , for an intensity - dependent coupling of the form @xmath13 between an initial cs and a jaynes - cummings atom , the mean photon number can be evaluated in closed form , and the mean photon energy undergoes periodic collapses and revivals in this case .",
    "subsequent studies have been carried out on the dynamics of the jaynes - cummings atom interacting through an intensity - dependent coupling with other initial states of the radiation field such as the squeezed vacuum and the @xmath14 coherent state @xcite . a coupling proportional to @xmath15 has also been used@xcite in a tripartite model , motivated by the fact that this form arises naturally in the context of diagonal - state representations of the density matrix in a restricted hilbert space where the zero - photon state is absent@xcite .",
    "an intensity - dependent coupling of the form @xmath16 has been shown@xcite to lead to a closed - form expression for the mean photon energy . here",
    "@xmath17 reduces to the heisenberg - weyl algebra for the field operators , while @xmath18 leads to the @xmath14 algebra for ( nonlinear combinations of ) these operators@xcite .",
    "intermediate values of @xmath19 corresponds to a deformed @xmath14 operator algebra . while the revival phenomenon has been examined in several models with intensity - dependent couplings , including the tripartite system of an atom interacting with two radiation fields @xcite , the effect of such a coupling on the entanglement dynamics and on eit has not been investigated .",
    "in this paper , we report on the effects of a general intensity - dependent coupling of the form @xmath20 on these two phenomena in the tripartite model of a @xmath0 atom interacting with two radiation modes .",
    "we have also investigated the corresponding case of a v atom .",
    "we do not present those results , as they are not qualitatively different in any significant manner from those for the @xmath0 atom .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    the tripartite model has two radiation fields : a ` probe field ' @xmath21 and a ` coupling field ' @xmath22 , of respective frequencies @xmath23 and @xmath24 , with annihilation and creation operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the highest energy state of the @xmath0 atom is denoted by @xmath27 , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the two lower energy states . @xmath21 and @xmath22 induce , respectively , the @xmath30 and @xmath31 transitions ,",
    "while the transition @xmath32 is dipole - forbidden .",
    "the general hamiltonian that incorporates field nonlinearities and intensity - dependent couplings is given ( setting @xmath33 by @xmath34 here , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is an atomic state , @xmath37 are positive constants , @xmath38 represents the strength of the nonlinearity in the field @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are the respective atom - field coupling strengths corresponding to the @xmath41 and @xmath42 transitions .",
    "further , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a real - valued function of @xmath45 that serves to incorporate a possible intensity - dependent coupling . as stated in the introduction , we consider the functional form @xmath46 , where @xmath47 takes values in the range @xmath48 $ ] . wherever relevant , a comparison will be made with results pertinent to the cases @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51 can be written as the sum @xmath52 , where @xmath53 @xmath54 here @xmath55 , @xmath56 are constants of the motion , and the two detuning parameters @xmath57 are given by @xmath58 @xmath59 merely introduces a phase factor in the time evolution of the state .",
    "it is therefore convenient to work in an appropriate interaction picture to eliminate this trivial dependence .",
    "earlier work @xcite pertaining to a @xmath0 atom interacting with two radiation fields involved an intensity - dependent coupling specified by @xmath60 , and a cross - kerr nonlinearity between the fields , but not individual field nonlinearities as in the present instance .",
    "entanglement collapse to a constant value over a significant time interval has not been reported hitherto , nor has eit been examined in this case .",
    "the model we consider here provides a natural setting for examining the effects of individual field nonlinearities , detuning parameters , a family of intensity - dependent couplings and specific classes of initial states on eit and entanglement dynamics during temporal evolution .",
    "the quantities we require for our study are the matrix elements of the time - dependent reduced density matrices of the tripartite system .",
    "we consider @xmath21 and @xmath22 to be initially in general superpositions of fock states , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively . for definiteness",
    ", the initial state of the atom is taken to be @xmath28 throughout .",
    "the initial state of the full system is thus @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes a state with the atom in @xmath28 and the fields @xmath21 and @xmath22 in states with @xmath65 and @xmath10 photons , respectively .",
    "( an analogous notation will be used for other field states as well , such as coherent and photon - added coherent states . ) proceeding on lines similar to those for the v atom@xcite , the interaction picture state vector at time @xmath66 is found to be @xmath67 where the functions @xmath68 are as follows .",
    "since the atom is taken to be initially in the state @xmath28 , it can not make a transition to @xmath27 if @xmath69 .",

    "an apparent precursor to collapse again appears as @xmath19 is further increased slightly ( figure [ fig : svne_5](f ) , @xmath181 ) , but what happens is that there is a shorter - duration collapse , followed by a revival , and then a second incipient collapse and revival ( figure [ fig : svne_5](g ) , @xmath182 ) , within the original time interval of collapse .",
    "a further small increase in @xmath19 produces a distinctive sequence of collapses and revivals ( figures [ fig : svne_5](h ) , ( i ) , ( j ) ) , which remains clear - cut till @xmath19 becomes a little larger than @xmath183 .",

    "as stated in the introduction , we have verified that these interesting features are also exhibited in the case of a v atom interacting with two radiation modes .",
    "[ [ section-7 ] ]    we have considered a tripartite system comprising a @xmath0-type or v - type atom interacting with two radiation fields . the mean photon number corresponding to the probe field is seen to display collapses and revivals for specific initial field states and parameters in the hamiltonian , in the absence of the coupling field . with",
    "the coupling field turned on , a window of electromagnetically - induced transparency appears during the collapse interval in the absorption spectrum . on a longer time scale , interesting dynamical effects",
    "are observed in the time evolution of the entanglement .",
    "this includes a collapse of the subsystem von neumann entropy of the atom over a considerable time interval .",
    "both these features are sensitive to the nature of the initial states of the fields , and seem to reflect the extent of the departure from coherence of those states .",
    "we have attempted to identify the roles played by field nonlinearities , detuning parameters and the departure from coherence of the initial states of the radiation fields on eit and on the extent of entanglement between subsystems during temporal evolution , since these two aspects are suitable for potential experimental investigations .",
    "detailed experiments on eit , the identification of the photon - added coherent state in the laboratory , and the necessity of retaining the extent of entanglement between subsystems from the point of view of quantum information processing add impetus to our investigations .",
    "reconstruction of the state of the system during svne collapse could possibly be attempted through continuous - variable quantum state tomography .",
    "the unanticipated behaviour of the svne as the strength of the intensity - dependent field - atom coupling is varied would correspondingly take the system through a spectrum of nonclassical states which are worth identifying through state reconstruction procedures .",
    "the mean photon number is seen to reflect the long time dynamics of the svne corresponding to the atomic subsystem .",
    "this is an observable which lends itself to experimental observation , and hence one that can be used to examine the dynamical features predicted for the tripartite model considered .",
