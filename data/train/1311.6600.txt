    "an essential task in quantum parameter estimation is to suppress the fundamental bound on measurement precision imposed by quantum mechanics .",
    "various quantum strategies have been developed to enhance the accuracy of the parameter estimation , which are closely related to some practical applications , such as the ramsey spectroscopies , atomic clocks , and the gravitational wave detection  .",
    "two approaches in common use for high - precision measurements are the parallel protocol with correlated multi - probes   and multi - round protocol with a single probe  @xcite .",
    "most recently , some novel methods , like environment - assisted metrology  @xcite and enhanced metrology by quantum error correction  @xcite , were raised to achieve high precision in realistic experiments .    rather than engineering the sensitivity - enhanced strategies , we concentrate on the problem of how to attain the maximal sensitivity in realistic experiments . in general",
    ", a noiseless procedure of the quantum single parameter estimation can be abstractly modeled by four steps ( see figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) : ( i ) preparing the input state @xmath0 , ( ii ) parameterizing it under the evolution of the parameter - dependent hamiltonian , for instance , a unitary evolution @xmath1 with @xmath2 the parameter to be estimated , ( iii ) performing measurements of the observable @xmath3 on the output state @xmath4 , ( iv ) finally estimating the value of the parameter from the estimator @xmath5 as a function of the outcomes of the measurements .    ,",
    "parametrization process @xmath6 , measurements @xmath3 , and estimator @xmath5 . here",
    ", we concentrate on the part in shadow to find the optimal @xmath3 attaining the highest sensitivity to the parameter @xmath2 in @xmath4.,width=559,height=128 ]    from estimation theory , the estimation precision is statistically measured by the units - corrected mean - square deviation of the estimator @xmath5 from the true value @xmath2 , @xmath7 where the brackets @xmath8 denote statistical average and the derivative @xmath9 removes the local difference in the  units \" of @xmath10 and @xmath2 .",
    "whatever is the measurement scheme employed , the ultimate limit to the precision of the unbiased estimate is given by the quantum cramr - rao bound ( qcrb ) from below as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the repetitions of the experiment and @xmath13 is the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) ( see equation  ( [ eq : qfi ] ) for definition ) , which measures the statistical distinguishability of the parameter in quantum states .",
    "this bound is asymptotically achieved for large @xmath12 under optimal measurements followed by the maximum likelihood estimator  .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is well - known that error - propagation is a widely acceptable theory in experiments  .",
    "with this theory , to estimate the parameter @xmath2 is reduced to measuring the average value of a physical observable @xmath3 . after repeating the experiment @xmath12 times , the real accessible precision on @xmath2 is given by the error - propagation formula as follows , @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "note that the two estimation errors defined in equations ( [ eq : uc_msd ] ) and ( [ eq : error - propagation ] ) are closely related . to show the relationship between the two kinds of the estimation errors , @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    ", we introduce @xmath19 .",
    "then , it is easy to show that   @xmath20 when viewing the arithmetic mean of the measurement outcomes of @xmath3 over repetitions of the experiment as the estimator in the quantum setting , one has in general @xmath21 by noting that @xmath22 for sufficiently large @xmath12 according to the central limit theorem  @xcite and comparison of the two definitions of the errors given by equations  ( [ eq : uc_msd ] ) and ( [ eq : error - propagation ] ) .",
    "in such situation , @xmath23 and @xmath24 have the same qcrb , and the saturation of the former implies that of the latter .",
    "the formula equation  ( [ eq : error - propagation ] ) indicates that the fluctuation of the observable @xmath3 propagates to the estimated values of the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "this means that what kinds observable @xmath3 employed directly affects the estimating precision of the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to address the question of with which kind of observable does the estimation error given by equation  ( [ eq : error - propagation ] ) achieve the qcrb given by equation  ( [ eq : qcrb ] ) .    in this paper , we derive the necessary and sufficient ( n&s ) condition for the optimal observable saturating the qcrb for the single parameter estimation by using the schrdinger - robertson uncertainty relation ( srur ) .",
    "we then apply this condition to ghz states and find the general form of the optimal observable for separable measurements to achieve the heisenberg - limit sensitivity ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) .",
    "moreover , we discuss the relation between the optimal separable observable and parity measurements .",
    "however , jose _",
    "_ , in a recent work , made a contradictory conclusion with respect to the above result .",
    "they claimed that separable measurements are impossible to go beyond the shot - noise limit ( i.e. , @xmath26 ) for any entangled states . to clarify this issue",
    ", we revisit the method in and show the causes for this inconsistency .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : ns ] , we first briefly review the single parameter estimation and obtain the n&s condition for the optimal observable . in section  [ sec :",
    "example ] , we give an application of this condition to obtain the optimal separable observables for ghz states to saturate the heisenberg - limit precision . in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we further elucidate the reasons for contradiction between the result given in and ours .",
    "at last , a conclusion is given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we start by a brief review of quantum single parameter estimation via the general estimator .",
    "consider a parametric family of density matrices @xmath27 containing an unknown parameter @xmath2 to be estimated .",
    "suppose that the general quantum measurement performed on @xmath27 is characterized by a positive - operator - valued measure @xmath28 with @xmath29 the results of measurement .",
    "the value of the parameter is inferred via an estimator @xmath5 , which maps the measurement outcomes to the estimated value . after repeating the experiment @xmath12 times ,",
    "the standard estimation error @xmath30 in equation  ( [ eq : uc_msd ] ) is bounded from below as @xmath31 where @xmath32 ^ 2\\ ] ] is the ( classical ) fisher information of the measurement - induced probability distribution @xmath33 .",
    "the maximization over all povms gives rise to the so - called qfi , which is defined by @xmath34 hence , a more tighter bound of equation  ( [ eq : crb ] ) is given by equation  ( [ eq : qcrb ] ) .",
    "here @xmath35 is the symmetric logarithmic derivative ( sld ) operator , which is a hermitian operator determined by @xmath36_{+ }      \\label{eq : sld}\\ ] ] with @xmath37_{+}$ ] denoting the anti - commutator , see reference  .",
    "it is remarkable that @xmath35 may not be uniquely determined by equation  ( [ eq : sld ] ) when @xmath4 is not of full rank @xcite .",
    "however , in general the value of the parameter @xmath2 may not be directly measured .",
    "the most general method of estimating the value of @xmath2 in practice involves measurements corresponding to a physical observable @xmath3 which is generally @xmath2-independent . in such cases ,",
    "the estimation error is given by the error - propagation formula equation  ( [ eq : error - propagation ] ) , in which the fluctuations on the observable @xmath3 propagate to the uncertainty in the estimation of @xmath2 . in the following , we follow hotta and ozawa to derive the achievable lower bound of the estimation error @xmath24 by using the srur .",
    "let us first recall the srur @xcite , which states that the uncertainty of two non - commuting observables @xmath38 must obey the following inequality @xmath39\\rangle\\vert^{2}+\\frac{1}{4}\\langle[\\delta \\hat{x},\\delta \\hat{y}]_{+}\\rangle^{2 } ,      \\label{eq : srur}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 $ ] denotes the commutator .",

    "the bound in equation  ( [ eq : cr_bound ] ) gives the highest precision for @xmath2 for the optimal observable @xmath49 , which coincides with the qcrb in equation  ( [ eq : qcrb ] ) .",
    "it is shown that the estimation error @xmath24 achieves the qcrb only when the two equalities in equations ( [ eq : gqcrb ] ) and ( [ eq : cr_bound ] ) hold simultaneously .",
    "below , we consider the attainability of the above bounds and give the n&s condition for optimal observables . from the n&s condition for equality in the srur",

    "it implies that the estimation error achieves the qcrb given by the qfi for @xmath27 _ only _ when the observable that we choose satisfies equation  ( [ eq : ns_condition ] ) .",
    "this is the main result of the paper . for pure states @xmath56 ,",
    "the condition  ( [ eq : ns_condition ] ) is equivalent to @xmath57    if we assume that the parameter @xmath2 here is imprinted via a unitary operation , i.e. , @xmath58 with @xmath59 the generator , associating with the equality @xmath60 $ ] , then condition  ( [ eq : cond_pure ] ) further reduces to @xmath61 this condition was alternatively obtained in ref .",
    "it is deserved to note that their proof is only valid in the case of unitary parametrization for pure states , and can not be generalized to obtain the condition ( [ eq : ns_condition ] ) .    here",
    ", we discuss the relations between the saturation of the qcrb with respect to @xmath23 and that with respect to @xmath24 . following braunstein and caves  , the saturation of the qcrb with respect to the error @xmath23",
    "can be separated as the saturation of a classical cramr - rao bound ( ccrb ) equation  ( [ eq : crb ] ) and finding an optimal measurement attaining the qfi .",
    "the ccrb can always be asymptotically achieved by the maximum likelihood estimator , so whether the qcrb can be asymptotically saturated is determined by whether the measurement attains the qfi .",
    "the n&s condition for the optimal measurement attaining the qfi reads   @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the povm of the measurement and @xmath64 are real numbers . in the following ,",
    "we show that the n&s condition ( [ eq : ns_condition ] ) for the saturation of the qcrb with respect to @xmath24 identifies an optimal measurement attaining qfi .",
    "let @xmath65 be the optimal observable satisfying eq .",
    "( [ eq : ns_condition ] ) and @xmath66 the eigenprojectors of @xmath65 with the eigenvalues @xmath29 . left multiplying @xmath66 on both sides of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ns_condition ] ) , it is easy to see that @xmath67 is the optimal measurement attaining the qfi .",
    "that is to say , the projective measurement @xmath67 followed by the maximum likelihood estimator of the measurement outcomes saturate the qcrb with respect to the standard estimation error @xmath23 .",
    "below , we apply the n&s condition to show the general optimal observable for ghz states .",
    "let us specifically consider an experimentally realizable ramsey interferometry to estimate the transition frequency @xmath68 of the two - level atoms loaded in the ion trap @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system with @xmath69 atoms is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the pauli matrix acting on the @xmath72th particle . in this setup ,",
    "the measurements are limited to be performed separately on each atom .",
    "the observable operator may be described as a tensor product of hermitian matrices @xmath73 with @xmath74 dependent of four real coefficients @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the identity matrix of dimension @xmath77 .",
    "suppose that the input state is the maximally entangled states , i.e. , ghz states , which provides the heisenberg - limit - scaling sensitivity of frequency estimation in the absence of noise . under the time evolution @xmath78",
    ", the output state can be represented as @xmath79 up to an irrelevant global phase with @xmath80 . here",
    ", we adopt the standard notation where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the eigenvectors of @xmath83 corresponding to eigenvalues @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively . to determine the optimal separable observable @xmath3",
    ", we need to find the solutions of the coefficients @xmath75 to satisfy equation  ( [ eq : cond_pure ] ) . with @xmath86 for pure states , the sld operator for the state of equation  ( [ eq : ghz_varphi ] ) is given by @xmath87 we find that equation  ( [ eq : cond_pure ] ) is always satisfied for @xmath88 and arbitrary real number @xmath89 that do not vanish simultaneously .",
    "therefore , the general expression of the optimal separable observable is given by @xmath90 which is independent of the parameter @xmath2 , i.e. , globally optimal in the whole range of the parameter .",
    "it is easy to check that such observables saturate the heisenberg - limit sensitivity .",
    "actually , according to the error - propagation formula equation  ( [ eq : error - propagation ] ) , we have @xmath91 as a result of @xmath92 ,      \\label{eq : expectation1}\\\\      \\langle \\hat{\\mathcal{o}}_{\\rm opt}^{2}\\rangle & = & ( a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2})^{n}.      \\label{eq : expectation2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when setting @xmath93 , the optimal observable in equation  ( [ eq : a_separable_ghz ] ) reduces to @xmath94 , as given in  .",
    "note that here measuring the observable @xmath94 fails to attain the heisenberg limit for the cases of @xmath95 in which equation  ( [ eq : error - propagation_ghz ] ) becomes singular .",
    "besides , we note that measuring the spin observable @xmath96 also fail in these cases when @xmath69 is even , and it is useful except for the cases of @xmath97 when @xmath69 is odd .",
    "we next show that the optimal observable in the form of equation  ( [ eq : a_separable_ghz ] ) is closely related to the parity measurement proposed originally by bollinger _",
    "as is well known , in the standard ramsey interferometry , there are generally two ramsey pulses applying before and after the free evolution ( with an accumulated phase @xmath2 ) , and measurements often take place after the second pulse . here the action of the pulse is modeled by a @xmath98-rotation operation about the @xmath99 axis , i.e. , @xmath100=\\exp[-i(\\frac{\\pi}{2})\\hat{j}_y]$ ] , and the measurement observable is denoted as the operator @xmath101 . with equation  ( [ eq : a_separable_ghz ] ) , one has @xmath102\\,\\hat{\\mathcal{o}}\\,r_y\\bigg[\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\bigg ] =       ( a_{1}\\hat{\\sigma}_{z}+a_{2}\\hat{\\sigma}_{y})^{\\otimes n}.       \\label{eq : a_separable_ghz_final}\\ ] ] when setting @xmath103 , equation  ( [ eq : a_separable_ghz_final ] ) reduces to @xmath104 with @xmath105 , which is the so - called parity measurement .",
    "it is shown that only a parity measurement is necessary for the optimal estimate of the phase parameter @xmath2 for ghz states , and it is more experimentally feasible than the detection strategy , as discussed in  , that applies local operations and classical communication .",
    "however , in a recent work , it was pointed out that the separable measurement ( the restricted readout procedure ) might not be possible to go beyond the shot - noise limit even for arbitrary entangled states .",
    "it seems that this conclusion is inconsistent with ours in the above discussion . in what follows",
    ", we clarify this issue by revisiting the method in   and showing the causes for this inconsistency .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider the two - qubit parametric ghz state @xmath106 following ref .",
    ", we restrict the separable measurement to be the projective measurements @xmath107 for each qubit with @xmath108 according to the condition of equation  ( [ eq : optimal_povm ] ) , whether the above restricted measurement presented by equation  ( [ eq : local_measurement ] ) is the optimal measurement saturating the qcrb can be tested by asking whether or not the operators of the form @xmath109 can be the sld operator for the state of equation  ( [ eq : ghz_varphi_2 ] ) . by domenstrating that for the state in equation  ( [ eq : ghz_varphi_2 ] ) with @xmath110",
    ", there is no solution of the sld equation  ( [ eq : sld ] ) for the coefficients @xmath111 in equation  ( [ eq : sld_projective_2 ] ) , the authors in ref",
    ".   claimed that the projective measurement about @xmath112 is not the optimal measurement for the state of equation  ( [ eq : ghz_varphi_2 ] ) .",
    "however , as we showed in the sec . 3 , @xmath113 is an optimal observable saturating the qcrb with respect to @xmath24 for the states ( [ eq : ghz_varphi_2 ] ) .",
    "although the estimation error considered in the ref .   is @xmath23 , a contradiction still arises , as the projective measurement of @xmath113 attains the qfi of states ( [ eq : ghz_varphi_2 ] ) ( see the end in sec .",
    "2 ) so that @xmath112 is the optimal measurement regarding the estimation error @xmath23 .",
    "below , we shall show that actually for any other point except for @xmath114 in the range of the parameter , there do exist the sld operator in form of equations  ( [ eq : sld_projective_2 ] ) .",
    "first , note that the sld operator for the non - full - rank density matrices is not uniquely determined , but @xmath115 ( or @xmath116 for pure state ) is uniquely determined .",
    "second , from equation  ( [ eq : sld_ghz_varphi ] ) , we see @xmath117 is a sld operator for the state of equation  ( [ eq : ghz_varphi_2 ] ) .",
    "third , since @xmath116 is uniquely determined , then if @xmath118 is the sld operator for @xmath119 if and only if @xmath120 is satisfied .",
    "thus , substituting equations  ( [ eq : ghz_varphi_2 ] ) , ( [ eq : sld_projective_2 ] ) and ( [ eq : sld_ghz ] ) into equation  ( [ eq : sld_pure_eq ] ) , we obtain the solutions for the coefficients as @xmath121 the above solutions are singular for @xmath114 , which coincide with the results discussed below equation  ( [ eq : expectation2 ] ) . note that here the @xmath122 case is just considered in ref .  .",
    "whilst , for a general value of the parameter except those singular points , the restricted separable measurement considered here indeed saturate the heisenberg - limit - scaling sensitivity for the parametric state of equation  ( [ eq : ghz_varphi_2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , it is easy to check that the same results of eq .",
    "( [ eq : shaji_solution ] ) can be obtained when restricting the separable measurement to be the projective measurements @xmath123 for each qubit with @xmath124 the eigenvectors of @xmath125 .",
    "this is coincided with the result shown below equation  ( [ eq : expectation2 ] ) that measuring the observable @xmath126 fails to attain heisenberg limit for the @xmath95 cases when @xmath69 is even .",
    "we have addressed the optimization problem of measurements for achieving the ultimate sensitivity determined by the qcrb . from the propagation of error",
    ", we derive the n&s condition of the optimal observables for single parameter estimate by using the srur . as an application of this condition",
    ", we examine the optimal observables for ghz states to achieve the ultimate sensitivity at the heisenberg limit .",
    "we consider an experimentally feasible case that the observable operators are restricted to separably acting on the subsystem .",
    "we then find the general expression of the optimal separable observable by applying the n&s condition , and show that it is exactly equivalent to the parity measurement when applying a @xmath98 pulse operation .",
