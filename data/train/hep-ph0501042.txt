    "the theoretical study of nonrelativistic heavy quark - antiquark systems is among the earliest applications of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite .",
    "its applications to bottomonium @xcite and top - antitop @xcite physics entirely rely on the first principles of qcd . in general perturbation theory",
    "can be applied for the analysis of these systems .",
    "nonperturbative effects @xcite are well under control for the top - antitop system and , at least within the sum - rule approach , also for bottomonium .",
    "this makes heavy quark - antiquark systems an ideal laboratory to determine fundamental parameters of qcd , such as the strong coupling constant @xmath4 and the heavy - quark masses @xmath5 .",
    "the binding energy of the heavy quarkonium state and the value of its wave function at the origin are among the characteristics of the heavy - quarkonium system that are of primary phenomenological interest .",
    "the former determines the mass of the bound state resonance , while the latter controls its production and annihilation rates .",
    "recently , the heavy quarkonium ground state energy has been computed through @xmath6 including the third - order correction to the coulomb approximation @xcite .",
    "the result has been used to extract @xmath7 from the @xmath3 meson mass .",
    "the properties of the excited states are more sensitive to the nonperturbative phenomena , and the corresponding perturbative estimates can not be used , _",
    "e.g. _ , for the accurate determination of the heavy - quark mass by direct comparison to the meson masses .",
    "however , they have to be taken into account in the framework of the nonrelativistic sum rules @xcite which is based on the concept of quark - hadron duality and keeps the nonperturbative effects under control . moreover , by investigating the excited states with reliable perturbative results at hand one can test the effects and structure of the nonperturbative qcd vacuum .",
    "still only a few states with small principal quantum numbers @xmath8 and zero orbital momentum @xmath9 are of practical interest .    as far as the wave function at the origin is concerned a complete result is only available through @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 correction has turned out to be so sizeable that the feasibility of an accurate perturbative analysis was challenged @xcite , and it appears indispensable to gain full control over the next order .",
    "only the logarithmically enhanced @xmath11  @xcite and @xmath12  @xcite ( for qed , see refs .",

    "the large-@xmath14 terms usually constitute a considerable part of the corrections and can be used to estimate the unknown nonlogarithmic third - order contribution to the wave function .    in the next section we present the @xmath15 corrections for the states with principle quantum number @xmath16 and angular momentum @xmath17 . in section  [ sec2 ]",

    "we would like to emphasize the role of the perturbative corrections necessary to bring theory and experiment into agreement which we will use in the following to estimate the order of magnitude of the nonperturbative effects .",
    "in fact the absence of a sufficiently accurate estimate of the nonperturbative part @xmath95 is one of the main problems in the theory of heavy quarkonium . in the limit @xmath96 it can be investigated by the method of vacuum condensate expansion @xcite .",
    "however , for bottomonium it can only be used for @xmath42 . for higher states the leading term due to the gluonic condensate grows as @xmath97 .",
    "it becomes unacceptably large already for @xmath93 where the whole series blows up @xcite . even for @xmath42",
    "such an estimate suffers from large uncertainties due to the poorly known value of the gluonic condensate and due to a strong scale dependence .",
    "a rough numerical estimate is @xmath98  mev  @xcite .",
    "since our perturbative result agrees very well with the experimental result we can conclude that @xmath99 should be of the same size as @xmath100 . in general for bottomonium",

    "the experimental input is given by the masses and leptonic width of the @xmath2 resonances which are known with high accuracy .",
    "on the theoretical side the nonperturbative effects are well under control .",
    "this makes the @xmath2 sum rules one of the most accurate sources for the bottom quark mass value .",
    "the complete perturbative analysis has been performed up to nnlo  @xcite .",
    "the extension to n@xmath91lo is a challenging problem .",
    "the theoretical value of the high moments is saturated by the contribution of a few lowest heavy quarkonium states and the corrections to the moments are dominated by the corrections to their masses and wave functions at the origin . to estimate the size of the n@xmath91lo corrections we include the @xmath0 result for the energy levels and the partial @xmath1 result for the wave function at the origin which includes all the logarithmic term @xcite and the @xmath13 terms obtained in section  [ sec2 ] .",

    "the situation changes drastically as the corrections to the wave function at the origin begin to play an important role .",
    "for @xmath106 the negative third - order contribution to the wave function completely cancels the effect of the third - order correction to the binding energy , and the correction to the pole mass @xmath7 almost vanishes .",
    "the pole mass can be converted into the @xmath107 mass @xmath108 which is widely believed to have much better perturbative properties .",
    "if we correlate the series so that the @xmath109-order correction to the sum rules goes along with the @xmath110-loop mass relation , which is natural for low moments , we obtain as an effect of the third - order corrections @xmath111  mev .",
    "we take this variation as an estimate for the size of the n@xmath91lo corrections within the @xmath2 sum - rule approach .",

    "* the nonperturbative effects in the case of the top quark are negligible .",
    "however , due to the relatively large top quark width ,",
    "@xmath112 , its effect has to be taken into account properly  @xcite since the coulomb - like resonances below threshold are smeared out .",
    "actually , the cross section only shows a small bump which is essentially the remnant of the ground state pole .",
    "the higher poles and continuum , however , affect the position of the resonance peak and move it to higher energy .",

    "[ fig::mu](b ) .",
    "the absence of a rapid growth of the coefficients along with the alternating - sign character of the series and the weak scale dependence suggest that the missing perturbative corrections are moderate and most likely are in the few - percent range .",
    "it is interesting to note that the perturbative contributions of different orders , which are relatively large when taken separately , cancel in the sum to give only a few percent variation of the leading order result .",
    "in this paper the important class of the third - order corrections to the heavy quarkonium parameters proportional to @xmath13 has been obtained . the complete result for the exited states spectrum to @xmath120",
    "is derived .",
    "the perturbative results are in surprisingly good agreement with the @xmath121 and @xmath122 meson masses and the leptonic width of the @xmath3 meson .",
    "thus the nonperturbative effects in bottomonium seem to be rather moderate and the theoretical results are dominated by the perturbative contributions .",
    "a failure of early low - order perturbative analysis to describe the @xmath2 system is due to large perturbative corrections to the coulomb approximation . on the basis of our results",
