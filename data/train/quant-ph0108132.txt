    "over the last ten years the theory of quantum trajectories has been developed by a wide variety of authors @xcite for a variety of purposes , including the ability to model continuously monitored open systems @xcite , improved numerical calculation @xcite , and insight into the problem of quantum measurement @xcite .",
    "however , outside the small communities of quantum optical theory and quantum foundations , the theory remains little known and poorly understood .",
    "indeed , the association with quantum foundations has convinced many observers that quantum trajectory theory is different from standard quantum mechanics , and therefore to be regarded with deep suspicion @xcite . while it is true that stochastic schrdinger and master equations of the type treated in quantum trajectories are sometimes postulated in alternative quantum theories @xcite ,",
    "these same types of equations arise quite naturally in describing quantum systems interacting with environments ( open systems ) which are subjected to monitoring by measuring devices . in these systems ,",
    "the stochastic equations arise as _ effective _ evolution equations , and are in no sense anything other than standard quantum mechanics ( except , perhaps , in the trivial sense of approaching the limit of continuous measurement ) .",
    "the fact that this is not widely appreciated , even in fields which might usefully employ quantum trajectories , is a great pity .",
    "i attribute it to confusion about exactly what the theory is , and how these equations arise .    to combat this confusion i present in this paper a simple model for quantum trajectories , using only two - level quantum systems ( _ quantum bits _ or q - bits ) .",
    "because of the recent interest in quantum information a great deal of attention has been paid to the possible interactions and measurements of two - level systems ; i will draw on this to build my model and show how effective stochastic evolution equations can arise due to a system interacting with a continuously monitored environment .",
    "this paper is intended as a tutorial , giving the physical basis of quantum trajectories without the complications arising from realistic systems and environments .",
    "as an aid in understanding or teaching the material , i have included a number of exercises throughout this paper .",
    "for the most part these involve working out derivations which arise in developing the model , but which are not crucial for following the main argument .",
    "the solutions to the exercises are included in the appendix .",
    "for simplicity , i will consider the simplest possible quantum system : a single two - level atom or q - bit .",
    "the environment will also consist of q - bits .",
    "while this is far easier to analyze than the more complicated systems used in most actual quantum trajectory simulations , it can illustrate almost all of the phenomena which occur in more realistic cases .",
    "moreover , the recent interest in quantum computation and quantum information has spurred a great deal of work on such systems of q - bits , which we can draw on .",
    "i will assume that the environment bits interact with the system bit successively for finite , disjoint intervals .",
    "i will further assume that these bits are all initially in the same state , have no correlations with each other , and do not interact amongst themselves .",
    "( see figure 1 . )",
    "therefore all that we need to consider is a succession of interactions between two q - bits .",
    "after each environment bit interacts with the system , we can measure it in any way we like , and use the information obtained to update our knowledge of the state .",
    "this model of system and environment may seem excessively abstract , but in fact a number of experimental systems can be approximated in this way .",
    "for instance , in experiments with ions in traps , residual molecules of gas can occasionally pass close to the ion , perturbing its internal state . in cavity qed",
    "experiments the system might be an electromagnetic mode inside a high-@xmath0 cavity .",
    "if there is never more than a single photon present , the mode is reasonably approximated as a two - level system .",
    "this mode can be probed by sending rydberg atoms through the cavity one at a time in a superposition of two neighboring electronic states , and measuring the atoms electronic states upon their emergence . in this case",
    ", the atoms are serving as both an environment for the cavity mode and a measurement probe .",
    "similarly , in an optical microcavity the external electromagnetic field can be thought of as a series of incoming waves which are reflected by the cavity walls ; photons leaking out from the cavity can move these modes from the vacuum to the first excited state .",
    "( see figure 2 . )      in section 2 , i describe systems of q - bits , and the possible two - bit interactions they can undergo . in section 3 , i examine possible kinds of measurements , including _ positive operator valued _ and _ weak _ measurements .",
    "in section 4 , i present the model of the system and environment . in section 5",
    "i show how it is possible to give an effective evolution for the system alone by tracing out the environment degrees of freedom , producing a kind of master equation .    in section 6 ,",
    "i consider the effects on the system state of a measurement on the environment , and deduce stochastic evolution equations for the system state , conditioned on the random outcome of the environment measurements .    in sections",
    "78 , i examine different interactions and measurements , and how they lead to different effective evolution equations for pure states  a kind of stochastic schrdinger equation .",
    "i show how under some circumstances the system appears to evolve by large discontinuous jumps , while for other models the state undergoes a slow diffusion in hilbert space .",
    "i further show that by averaging over the different measurement outcomes we recover the master equation evolution of section 5 .",
    "in section 9 , i consider measurement schemes which give only partial information about the system .",
    "these schemes lead to stochastic master equations rather than schrdinger equations .",
    "finally , in section 10 i relax the assumption of measurement , and discuss how quantum trajectories can be used to give insight into the nature of measurement itself , using the decoherent ( consistent ) histories formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "i also briefly consider alternative quantum theories which make use of stochastic equations . in section 11",
    "i summarize the paper and draw conclusions .",
    "i present the solution to the exercises in the appendix .",
    "the simplest possible quantum mechanical system is a two - level atom or _ q - bit _ , which has a two - dimensional hilbert space @xmath1 .",
    "there are many physical embodiments of such a system : the spin of a spin-1/2 particle , the polarization states of a photon , two hyperfine states of a trapped atom or ion , two neighboring levels of a rydberg atom , the presence or absence of a photon in a microcavity , etc .",
    "all of the above have been proposed in various schemes for quantum information and quantum computation , and many have been used in actual experiments .",
    "( for a good general source on quantum computation and information , see nielsen and chuang @xcite and references therein . )    by convention , we choose a particular basis and label its basis states @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which we define to be the eigenstates of the pauli spin matrix @xmath4 with eigenvalues @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "we similarly define the other pauli operators @xmath7 ; linear combinations of these , together with the identity @xmath8 , are sufficient to produce any operator on a single q - bit .",
    "the most general pure state of a q - bit is @xmath9 a global phase may be assigned arbitrarily , so all physically distinct pure states of a single q - bit form a two - parameter space .",
    "a useful parametrization is in terms of two angular variables @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "these two parameters define a point on the _ bloch sphere_. the north and south poles of the sphere represent the eigenstates of @xmath4 , and the eigenstates of @xmath15 and @xmath16 lie on the equator .",
    "orthogonal states always lie opposite each other on the sphere .    if we allow states to be",
    ", we represent a q - bit by a density matrix @xmath17 ; the most general density matrix can be written @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are two orthogonal pure states , @xmath21 .",
    "the mixed states of a q - bit form a three parameter family : @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the same angular parameters as before and @xmath24 .",
    "the limit @xmath25 is the set of pure states , parametrized as in ( [ pure_param ] ) , while @xmath26 is the _ completely mixed state _ @xmath27 .",
    "thus we can think of the bloch sphere as having pure states on its surface and mixed states in its interior ; and the distance @xmath28 from the center is a measure of the state s purity .",
    "it is simply related to the parameter @xmath29 in ( [ orthog_rho ] ) : @xmath30 , @xmath31 .    for _",
    "two _ q - bits , the hilbert space @xmath32 has a tensor - product basis @xmath33 similarly , for @xmath34 q - bits we can define a basis @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "a useful labeling of these @xmath37 basis vectors is by the integers @xmath38 whose binary expressions are @xmath39 : @xmath40    all states evolve according to the schrdinger equation with some hamiltonian @xmath41 , @xmath42 over a finite time this is equivalent to applying a unitary operator @xmath43 to the state @xmath19 , @xmath44 where @xmath45 indicates that the integral should be taken in a time - ordered sense , with early to late times being composed from right to left . for the models i consider in this paper i will treat all time evolution at the level of unitary transformations rather than explicitly solving the schrdinger equation ,",
    "so time can be treated as a discrete variable @xmath46 for a mixed state @xmath17 , schrdinger time evolution is equivalent to @xmath47 .",
    "henceforth , i will also assume @xmath48 .",
    "if the unitary operator @xmath49 is _ weak _ , that is , close to the identity , one can always find a hamiltonian operator @xmath50 such that @xmath51 thus , one can easily recover the schrdinger equation from a description in terms of unitary operators , @xmath52    * exercise 1 . * show that the most general unitary operator on a single q - bit can be written @xmath53 modulo an irrelevant overall phase , where @xmath54 is a three - vector with unit norm and @xmath55 .",
    "in the bloch sphere picture this is a rotation by an angle @xmath56 about the axis defined by @xmath57 , with three real parameters ( four if one includes the global phase ) .    for two q - bits there is unfortunately no such simple visualization as the bloch sphere .",
    "however , to specify any unitary transformation it suffices to give its effect on a complete set of basis vectors .",
    "i will consider only a fairly limited set of two - bit transformations in this paper , and no transformations involving more than two q - bits , but the simple formalism i derive readily generalizes to higher - dimensional systems .",
    "let us examine a couple of examples of two - bit transformations .",
    "the controlled - not gate ( or cnot ) is widely used in quantum computation ; applied to the tensor - product basis vectors it gives @xmath58 or in matrix form @xmath59 if the first bit is in state @xmath2 this gate leaves the second bit unchanged ; if the first bit is in state @xmath3 the second bit is flipped @xmath60 .",
    "hence the name : whether a not gate is performed on the second bit is _ controlled _ by the first bit . in terms of single - bit operators this is @xmath61 .",
    "another important gate in quantum computation is the swap ; applied to the tensor - product basis vectors it gives @xmath62 which in matrix form is just @xmath63 as the name suggests , the swap gate just exchanges the states of the two bits : @xmath64 .",
    "cnot and swap are examples of two - bit _",
    "quantum gates_. such gates are of tremendous importance in the theory of quantum computation .",
    "these two gates in particular have an additional useful property .",
    "note that the operator @xmath65 , i.e. , it is both unitary and hermitian .",
    "this is also true of @xmath66 .",
    "this is only possible if all of the operator s eigenvalues are @xmath67 or @xmath5 .",
    "this also means that these operators are their own inverses , @xmath68 .",
    "( among single - bit operators , the pauli matrices @xmath69 also have this property , as does any operator @xmath70 . )",
    "this property of being both unitary and hermitian makes it possible to define one - parameter families of two - bit unitary transformations : @xmath71 and similarly @xmath72    * exercise 2 .",
    "* show that any operator @xmath43 which is both unitary and hermitian satisfies @xmath73 .",
    "these families range from the identity @xmath8 for @xmath74 to the full cnot ( or swap ) gate for @xmath75 , up to a global phase . for small values",
    "@xmath76 , this is a weak interaction , which leaves the state only slightly altered .",
    "these families do have an undesirable characteristic , however .",
    "suppose we apply @xmath77 to a two - bit state of the form @xmath78 .",
    "the new state is @xmath79 this relative phase @xmath80 between @xmath2 and @xmath3 is a complication in the calculations that will follow . to avoid this problem , instead of @xmath77 and @xmath81 we will use interactions of the form @xmath82 , where @xmath83 , and similarly for @xmath66 .",
    "the single - bit rotation exactly undoes the extra relative phase produced by @xmath77 , while changing nothing else .    before leaving the topic of two - bit gates",
    ", i should point out another representation which is sometimes useful .",
    "any operator on two q - bits can formally be written @xmath84 where @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "the matrix elements can be calculated using the identity @xmath87 if @xmath88 is hermitian , the matrix elements @xmath89 will be real .",
    "if we write the cnot in this form , it gives matrix elements @xmath89 @xmath90 similarly , if we write the swap gate this way it has matrix elements @xmath91",
    "in the standard description of quantum mechanics , observables are identified with hermitian operators @xmath88 .",
    "a measurement returns an eigenvalue @xmath92 of @xmath93 and leaves the system in the corresponding eigenstate @xmath94 , @xmath95 , with probability @xmath96 .",
    "if a particular eigenvalue is degenerate , one instead uses the projector @xmath97 onto the eigenspace with eigenvalue @xmath92 ; the probability of the measurement outcome is then @xmath98 and the system is left in the state @xmath99 . for a mixed state @xmath17",
    "the probability of outcome @xmath100 is @xmath101 and the state after the measurement is @xmath102 .",
    "because two observables with the same eigenspaces are completely equivalent to each other ( as far as measurement probabilities and outcomes are concerned ) , we will not worry about the exact choice of hermitian operator @xmath93 ; instead , we will choose a complete set of orthogonal projections @xmath103 which represent the possible measurement outcomes .",
    "these satisfy @xmath104 a set of projection operators which obey ( [ orthogonal_decomp ] ) is often referred to as an _ orthogonal decomposition of the identity_. for a single q - bit , the only nontrivial measurements have exactly two outcomes , which we label @xmath105 and @xmath106 , with probabilities @xmath107 and @xmath108 and associated projectors of the form @xmath109 this is equivalent to choosing an axis @xmath110 on the bloch sphere and projecting the state onto one of the two opposite points .",
    "all such operators are projections onto pure states .",
    "the two projectors sum to the identity operator , @xmath111 .",
    "the average information obtained from a projective measurement on a q - bit is just the shannon entropy for the two measurement outcomes , @xmath112 the maximum information gain is precisely one bit , when @xmath113 , and the minimum is zero bits when either @xmath107 or @xmath108 is 0 . after the measurement ,",
    "the state is left in an eigenstate of @xmath114 , so repeating the measurement will result in the same outcome .",
    "this repeatability is one of the most important features of projective measurements .",
    "while projective measurements are the most familiar from introductory quantum mechanics , there is a more general notion of measurement , the _ positive operator valued measurement _ ( povm ) @xcite . instead of giving a set of projectors which sum to the identity",
    ", we give a set of _ positive operators _ @xmath115 which sum to the identity : @xmath116 the probability of outcome @xmath100 is @xmath117 , or for a mixed state @xmath118 . unlike a projective measurement , knowing the operators @xmath115 is _ not _ sufficient to determine the state of the system after measurement .",
    "one must further know a set of operators @xmath119 such that @xmath120 after measurement outcome @xmath100 the state is @xmath121 this measurement will not preserve the purity of states , in general , unless there is only a single @xmath119 for each @xmath115 ( that is , @xmath122 ) , in which case @xmath123 .    because the positive operators @xmath115 need not be projectors , one is not limited to only two possible outcomes",
    "; indeed , there can be an unlimited number of possible outcomes .",
    "however , if a povm is repeated , the same result will not necessarily be obtained the second time .",
    "projective measurements are clearly a special case of povms in which results _ are _ repeatable .",
    "most actual experiments do _ not _ correspond to projective measurements , but are described by some more general povm .",
    "conversely , it is easy to show that any povm can be performed by allowing the system which is to be measured to interact with an additional system , or _",
    "ancilla _ , and then doing a projective measurement on the ancilla . in this viewpoint ,",
    "only some of the information obtained comes from the system ; part can also come from the ancilla , which injects extra randomness into the result .",
    "this mathematical identification should not be pushed too far , however ; in practice , trying to interpret a povm as a projective measurement on an ancilla often adds complexity without improving understanding .",
    "a particularly interesting kind of povm for the present purpose is the _ weak measurement",
    "this is a measurement which gives very little information about the system on average , but also disturbs the state very little .",
    "loosely speaking , there are two ways a measurement can be considered weak .",
    "suppose we have a q - bit in a state of form ( [ qbit_pure ] ) , and we perform a povm with the following two operators : @xmath124 where @xmath125 . clearly @xmath126 and @xmath127 are positive and @xmath128 ,",
    "so this is a povm .",
    "the probability @xmath129 of outcome 0 is close to 1 , while @xmath130 is very unlikely .",
    "thus , most such measurements will give outcome 0 , and very little information is obtained about the system .",
    "* exercise 3 . *",
    "show that the average information gain from this measurement ( in bits ) is @xmath131    the state changes very slightly after a measurement outcome 0 , with @xmath2 becoming slightly more likely relative to @xmath3 .",
    "the new state is @xmath132    however , after an outcome of 1 , the state can change dramatically : a measurement outcome of 1 leaves the q - bit in the state @xmath3 .",
    "we see that this type of measurement is weak in that it _ usually _ gives little information , and has little effect on the state ; but on rare occasions it can give a great deal of information and have a large effect .",
    "by contrast , consider the following positive operators : @xmath133",
    "these operators also constitute a povm .",
    "both @xmath126 and @xmath127 are close to @xmath134 , and so are almost equally likely for all states , @xmath135 ; the information acquired is approximately one bit .",
    "but the state of the system is almost unchanged for _ both _ outcomes , with the new state being @xmath136 , @xmath137 for outcomes 0 and 1 , respectively .",
    "for this type of weak measurement , the measurement outcome is almost random , but does include a tiny amount of information about the state . by performing repeated weak measurements and examining the statistics of the results , one can in effect perform a strong measurement ; for the particular case considered here , the state will tend to drift towards either @xmath2 or @xmath3 with overall probabilities @xmath138 and @xmath139",
    ".    we will see below specific instances of how a povm can arise by the interaction of the measured system with an ancilla , and the subsequent projective measurement of the ancilla .",
    "quantum trajectories are closely related to such indirect measurement schemes .",
    "in discussing quantum evolution it is usually assumed that the quantum system is very well isolated from the rest of the world .",
    "this is a useful idealization , but it is rarely realized in practice , even in the laboratory .",
    "in fact , most systems interact at least weakly with external degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "one way of taking this into account is to include a model of these external degrees of freedom in our description .",
    "let us assume that in addition to the system in state @xmath19 in hilbert space @xmath140 with hamiltonian @xmath141 , there is an external _ environment _ in state @xmath142 with hamiltonian @xmath143 .",
    "the joint hilbert space of the system and environment is the tensor product space @xmath144 , and the full hamiltonian can be written @xmath145 where @xmath146 is a hamiltonian giving the interaction between the two .",
    "the system and environment evolve according to the schrdinger equation ( [ schrodinger ] ) with this full hamiltonian . because of the presence of the @xmath146 term , in general even initial product states @xmath147 will evolve into states which can not be written as product states : @xmath148 such states are called _",
    "entangled_. if the system and environment are entangled , it is no longer possible to attribute a unique pure state to the system ( or environment ) alone .",
    "the best that can be done is to describe the system as being in a mixed state @xmath149 , which is the partial trace of the joint state @xmath150 over the environment degrees of freedom : @xmath151 where the @xmath152 are some complete set of orthonormal basis vectors on the environment hilbert space @xmath153 .",
    "the entanglement of a state can be quantified .",
    "the most widely used measure for pure states is the _ entropy of entanglement_. for a system and environment in a joint pure state , this is @xmath154 which is the _ von  neumann entropy _ of the reduced density operator @xmath155 .",
    "this entropy is maximized by the density operator @xmath156 ; such a density operator is called _ maximally mixed _ , and the joint pure state which gives rise to it is called _ maximally entangled_.    * exercise 4 . * show that the von  neumann entropy is maximized for @xmath157    systems which interact with their environments are said to be _",
    "open_. most real physical environments are extremely complicated , and the interactions between systems and environments are often poorly understood . in analyzing open systems , one often makes the approximation of assuming a simple , analytically solvable form for the environment degrees of freedom .    for the models of this paper , i will assume that both the system and the environment consist solely of q - bits .",
    "i will also assume a simple form of interaction , namely that the system q - bit interacts with one environment q - bit at a time , and that after interacting they never come into contact again ; and that the environment q - bits have no hamiltonian of their own , @xmath158 .",
    "this environment may seem ridiculously oversimplified , but in fact it suffices to demonstrate most of the physics exhibited by much more realistic descriptions . and",
    "in fact , the description in terms of q - bits is not a bad schematic picture of many environments at low energies .",
    "i summarize one such possible environment in figure 2 .    for this type of model ,",
    "the hilbert space of the system is @xmath159 and the hilbert space of the environment is @xmath160 .",
    "i will in general assume that all the environment q - bits start in some pure initial state , usually @xmath2 ; however , in later elaborations of the model i will relax this assumption to include both other pure states and mixed - state environments , which resemble heat baths of finite temperature .",
    "a system interacting with an environment usually can not be described in terms of a pure state .",
    "similarly , it is not usually possible to give a simple time - evolution for the system alone , without reference to the state of the environment .",
    "however , under certain circumstances one can find an effective evolution equation for the system alone , if the interaction between the system and environment has a simple form and the initial state of the environment has certain properties .    in cases where such an effective evolution equation exists",
    ", it will not be of the form ( [ schrodinger ] ) .",
    "instead , the evolution equation will be _ completely positive _ , which is a weaker condition than unitarity .",
    "it must take density matrices to density matrices , but not necessarily pure states to pure states . to be tractable",
    ", such an equation must also generally be _",
    ": it must give the evolution of the density operator solely in terms of its state at the present time , with no retarded terms .",
    "( while it is possible to find retarded descriptions for more general non - markovian open systems , they tend to be difficult to solve , even numerically . )",

    "this evolution can not be described by a stochastic schrdinger equation ; rather , one must use a stochastic _ master _",
    "equation , which gives the evolution of a density matrix conditioned on the measurement outcomes .",
    "the master equation takes the form @xmath327",
    "\\left ( { w_1\\over p_0 } ( 1-f ) + { w_0\\over p_1 } f    \\right ) \\delta t \\;. \\label{stoch_master}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath328 is the anticommutator , and @xmath329 .",
    "the stochastic variable @xmath330 takes the value 0 with probability @xmath257 and 1 with probability @xmath258 .",
    "we see then that this equation ( [ stoch_master ] ) reduces to ( [ mean_lindblad ] ) in the mean , and hence gives a _ partial _ unraveling of that equation in terms of mixed states . when @xmath331 this master equation exhibits jump - like behavior ; when @xmath332 it is diffusive .",
    "if @xmath333 then ( [ stoch_master ] ) reduces to the mean equation ( [ mean_lindblad ] ) , since the measurements yield no information whatsoever about the system .",
    "( note that this need nt be true for all possible interactions .",
    "for instance , if we use @xmath81 instead of @xmath77 , it _ is _ possible to obtain information about the system even using a maximally mixed environment , as we see below . )",
    "if the system interacts with @xmath100 environment bits , each of which is subsequently measured in the @xmath196 basis giving a measurement record @xmath261 , the system will be left in the state @xmath334 where @xmath335 depends on the exact sequence of measurement results , and @xmath336 is given by ( [ asymptotic_jump ] ) and obeys @xmath337 as @xmath248 .",
    "the state will tend to evolve towards either @xmath338 or @xmath255 unless @xmath339 .",
    "so we see that even when a state becomes mixed , under some circumstances it can evolve towards a pure state again .",
    "if instead of @xmath77 the interaction were @xmath81 , the noise would affect the system in an different way . in this case",
    "the system will be left in one of the states @xmath340 \\ ; , \\nonumber\\\\ \\rho_1 & = & { 1\\over p_1}\\left [ w_1 \\ket{\\psi_1}\\bra{\\psi_1 }    + w_0 |\\beta|^2\\sin^2\\theta \\ket0\\bra0 \\right ] \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath341 and @xmath342 in this case , rather than evolving eventually towards one of the pure states @xmath343 , the system will evolve towards the state @xmath344 , i.e. , it will become identical with the mixed state of the environment bits .",
    "this is quite similar to the process of thermalization , by which a system interacting with a heat bath evolves towards equilibrium .",
    "now we will assume that both the system and environment q - bits begin in a pure state , but that the measurement performed on the environment bit is no longer a projective measurement , but instead a povm which provides only partial information about the state of the environment bit .",
    "let us consider a system where the system and environment q - bits interact via @xmath235 , the environment bits start initially in the state @xmath2 , and the system is in state @xmath193 . after the system and environment interact , the environment is measured with a povm using operators @xmath345 assume that @xmath346 .",
    "a measurement result 0 then favors the environment q - bit being in state @xmath2 , and a result 1 favors @xmath3 , but neither result is conclusive .",
    "after the system and environment interact , the probabilities of the two outcomes are @xmath347 if we assume @xmath206 , tracing out the environment leaves the system in one of the mixed states @xmath348 with the updated state @xmath349 that is , the system state remains entangled with the environment q - bit .",
    "this environmental interaction and measurement leaves the system in a state of the form @xmath350 if a state in that form interacts with another environment bit , on which the same povm is performed , the system state will remain in the same form .",
    "after @xmath100 interactions , the state will have the form ( [ rho_xi ] ) , with @xmath337 as @xmath248 , and the state tending towards either @xmath338 or @xmath255 at long times .",
    "thus , the system evolution looks quite similar to the case when the environment is initially in a mixed state and a projective measurement is performed .",
    "however , in the case of a mixed environment the system has no entanglement with the environment , and is in a mixed state due to noise ; in the case of incomplete measurements , the system is entangled with the environment , and the system and environment as a whole remain in a pure state .    in this case",
    "as well , one can describe the evolution of the system by a stochastic master equation .",
    "this has exactly the same form as ( [ stoch_master ] ) , with @xmath351 replaced by @xmath352 and @xmath353 . unlike the previous case ,",
    "however , the system state is not mixed because of classical noise entering from the environment , but rather because it remains entangled with the environment .",
    "the povm just considered represents a measurement with imperfect discrimination .",
    "let s consider a different way that a measurement may be incomplete .",
    "consider the following positive operators : @xmath354 these operators @xmath355 sum up to the identity , and for @xmath356 form a povm .",
    "@xmath126 and @xmath127 are proportional to orthogonal projectors ; @xmath357 , by contrast , leaves the state completely unchanged .",
    "this is like a measurement made with a detector of efficiency @xmath352 ; there is a probability @xmath353 that the detector will fail to register anything at all , and hence gives no information about the state .",
    "suppose the system q - bit is originally in a state of form @xmath358 ( where an initial pure state would have @xmath359 ) .",
    "then a measurement result of 0 has probability @xmath360 \\approx q[1 - ( 1-w_0|\\alpha|^2)\\theta^2 ] \\;,\\ ] ] and leaves the system in a mixed state of the same form @xmath361 the result 1 has probability @xmath362    \\approx q ( 1-w_0|\\alpha|^2)\\theta^2 \\;,\\ ] ] and leaves the system in the state @xmath363 ; and the result ( or rather , nonresult ) 2 has probability @xmath364 and leaves the system in the mixed state @xmath365 if the evolution began in a pure state , it will remain in a pure state unless outcome 2 occurs ; but once this happens , the state will tend to remain mixed until either a result 1 occurs ( in which case the system will be in state @xmath3 thenceforth ) or , in the limit of large @xmath100 , the system approaches the state @xmath2 .",
    "the measurement process works much as before , but the null results slow the convergence ; if the efficiency @xmath352 is low , it can take far longer for the state to settle down to either @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "as is clear from the previous sections , the formalism of quantum trajectories calls on nothing more than standard quantum mechanics , and as framed above is in no way an alternative theory or interpretation .",
    "everything can be described solely in terms of measurements and unitary transformations , the building blocks of the usual copenhagen interpretation .",
    "however , many people have expressed dissatisfaction with the standard interpretation over the years , usually due to the role of measurement as a fundamental building block of the theory .",
    "measuring devices are large , complicated things , very far from elementary objects ; what exactly constitutes a measurement is never defined ; and the use of classical mechanics to describe the states of measurement devices is not justified .",
    "presumably the individual atoms , electrons , photons , etc . , which make up a detector can themselves be described by quantum mechanics .",
    "if this is carried to its logical conclusion , however , and a schrdinger equation is constructed for the measurement process , one obtains not classical behavior , but rather giant macroscopic superpositions such as the famous schrdinger s cat paradox @xcite .",
    "three major approaches have been followed in tackling this problem . in the first ,",
    "`` hidden variables '' are introduced which determine the outcome of measurements , so that quantum mechanics is a partial description of an underlying deterministic theory .",
    "unfortunately , as john bell showed @xcite , such a hidden variables theory ( such as that of de broglie and bohm @xcite ) must be nonlocal to give the same predictions as quantum mechanics .",
    "the second approach is to modify quantum mechanics to get rid of the unwanted macroscopic superpositions , while retaining the usual quantum results on small scales .",
    "theories of this nature have been proposed by pearle @xcite , by ghirardi , rimini and weber @xcite , by disi @xcite , by gisin @xcite and percival @xcite , and by penrose @xcite , among others ; these theories are commonly called `` collapse models . ''",
    "these alternative theories usually replace the schrdinger equation with a new , stochastic equation , which includes a mechanism to produce wave function collapse onto some preferred basis .",
    "such stochastic schrdinger equations often strongly resemble those produced by a suitable quantum trajectory description , in which the system interacts continuously with an environment which is repeatedly measured . while i do not know if _ all _ such alternative theories are equivalent to a quantum trajectory description , certainly a large class of them is .    because these theories are not equivalent to standard quantum mechanics , in principle they can be distinguished experimentally .",
    "unfortunately , most such theories require experimental sensitivities well beyond current technology , though percival @xcite has made interesting proposals of possible near - term tests .    theoretically there are also problems in producing relativistic versions of such theories .",
    "most such models produce collapse onto localized variables , such as position states .",
    "such localization , however , does not in general commute with the hamiltonian , and so such theories almost always violate energy conservation  sometimes spectacularly",
    "so @xcite .",
    "another class of models produces a collapse onto states of definite energy @xcite , rather than localized variables .",
    "it is not clear , however , that such collapse models eliminate macroscopic superpositions in either the short or long term .",
    "certainly the end result , a universe in an energy eigenstate  a static , unchanging state with no dynamics  does not greatly resemble the world that we perceive , though in the context of an expanding universe even this is unclear .",
    "the last approach is to retain the usual quantum theory , but to eliminate measurement as a fundamental concept , finding some other interpretation for the predicted probabilities .",
    "while there are many interpretations that follow this approach , the one that is most closely tied to quantum trajectories is the _ decoherent _ ( or _ consistent _ ) _ histories formalism _ of griffiths , omns , gell - mann and hartle @xcite . in this formalism",
    ", probabilities are assigned to _ histories _ of events rather than measurement outcomes at a single time .",
    "these can be grouped into _ sets _ of mutually exclusive , exhaustive histories whose probabilities sum to 1 .",
    "however , not all histories can be assigned probabilities under this interpretation ; only histories which lie in sets which are _ consistent _ , that is , whose histories do not exhibit interference with each other , and hence obey the usual classical probability sum rules .",
    "each set is basically a choice of description for the quantum system . for the models considered in this paper , the quantum trajectories correspond to histories in such a consistent set .",
    "the probabilities of the histories in the set exactly equal the probabilities of the measurement outcomes corresponding to a given trajectory .",
    "this equivalence has been shown between quantum trajectories and consistent sets for certain more realistic systems , as well @xcite",
    ".    for a given quantum system , there can be multiple consistent descriptions which are _ incompatible _ with each other ; that is , unlike in classical physics , these descriptions can not be combined into a single , more finely - grained description . in quantum trajectories ,",
    "different unravelings of the same evolution correspond to such incompatible descriptions . in both cases , this is an example of the complementarity of quantum mechanics .",
    "we see , then , that while quantum trajectories can be straightforwardly defined in terms of standard quantum theory when the environment is subjected to repeated measurements , even in the absence of such measurements there is an interpretation of the trajectories in terms of decoherent histories .",
    "because the consistency conditions guarantee that the probability sum rules are obeyed , one can therefore use quantum trajectories as a calculational tool even in cases where no actual measurements take place .",
    "in this paper i have presented a simple model of a system and environment consisting solely of quantum bits , using no more than single - bit measurements and one- and two - bit unitary transformations .",
    "the simplicity of this model makes it particularly suitable for demonstrating the properties of quantum trajectories .",
    "we see that these require no more than the usual quantum formalism , though they can , of course , also be applied in cases going beyond standard quantum mechanics , such as collapse models or the decoherent histories interpretation .",
    "quantum trajectories can often simplify the description of an open quantum system in terms of a stochastically evolving pure state rather than a density matrix . while for the q - bit models of this paper there is no great advantage in doing so , for more complicated systems this",
    "can often make a tremendous difference @xcite .    in this model",
    "it is also possible to straightforwardly quantify the flow of information between system and environment , in the form of entanglement and noise , as well as the information acquired in measurements and the decrease in entropy of the system .",
    "for realistic systems and environments this may be more difficult to do analytically , but one can still form a qualitative picture of the information flow in decoherence and measurement .",
    "i hope that this model will clear up much of the confusion that currently surrounds the theory of quantum trajectories .",
    "quantum trajectories are a very useful formal and numerical tool , and should find applications well outside their current niches in quantum optics and measurement theory .",
    "the idea for this paper arose during a very productive visit to the university of oregon , and it has been encouraged by the kindness of many people .",
