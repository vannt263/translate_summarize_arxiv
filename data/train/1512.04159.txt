    "star formation is one of the most fundamental processes in the evolutions of galaxies from nearby objects to high - redshift ones .",
    "the star - formation law , which is a quantitative relationship between star formation rates ( sfrs ) and surface mass densities of molecular gas , is represented as a simple power - law and it is often referred to as the schmidt - kennicutt law ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , variations in the power - law index and dispersion of the star - formation law according to the differences in star - formation environments and physical / chemical properties of molecular gas have been investigated by several authors on the basis of low-@xmath8 co observations .",
    "for example , @xcite suggested two different star formation modes in the gas mass versus sfr plane .",
    "one is a rapid starburst mode appropriate for ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , submillimeter selected galaxies , and local starbursts , and the other is a long - lasting mode appropriate for normal galaxy disks .",
    "the former mode shows about 1 dex higher star formation efficiencies ( sfes , defined as sfr per unit gas mass ) than the latter mode",
    ". such bimodal behavior of the star - formation law may be due to the effects of a top - heavy initial mass function in starbursts and/or the difference in dense gas fraction ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite provided a theoretical explanation for such a disk - starburst bimodality .",
    "the authors showed that their sample from galactic clouds to submillimeter galaxies all lie on a single star formation law in which the sfr is simply @xmath9 of the molecular gas mass per local free - fall time .",
    "@xcite demonstrated a first - order linear correspondence between surface densities of molecular gas and sfrs but also found second - order systematic variations for 30 nearby galaxies at a spatial resolution of 1 kpc .",
    "the authors found that the apparent molecular gas depletion time , which is an inverse of sfe , decreases with the decrease in stellar mass , metallicity , and dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "this can be explained by a co - to - h@xmath10 conversion factor that depends on dust shielding .    in order to understand the relationship between molecular gas and sfr further",
    ", higher-@xmath8 co transition gives an important clue because it can directly trace star - forming denser molecular medium owing to its high critical density .",
    "for instance , the star - formation law based on co(@xmath0 ) emission ( its critical density for collisional excitation is @xmath11 @xmath12 ) is often reported .",
    "single - pointing co(@xmath0 ) emission observations toward central regions of nearby galaxies or entire disks of distant galaxies showed the nearly linear correlations between co(@xmath0 ) line intensities and sfrs ( or between co(@xmath0 ) luminosities , @xmath2 , and infrared ( ir ) luminosities , @xmath3 ) with a better correlation coefficient than those based on co(@xmath13 ) emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which suggests that measurements of co(@xmath0 ) intensities correspond to a simple count of star - forming dense cores within the observing beam ( see also @xcite and @xcite for similar co to @xmath3 relations in higher-@xmath8 transitions ) .",
    "obtaining wide - area and spatially - resolved co(@xmath0 ) maps of galaxies is also important to examine the relationship between dense molecular gas and star formation in galaxy disks .",
    "an extensive co(@xmath0 ) imaging survey of nearby galaxies is conducted using james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) .",
    "for example , @xcite performed the co(@xmath0 ) mapping of some members of virgo clusters ( ngc  4254 , ngc  4321 , and ngc  4569 ) , and examined a spatial variations in the gas properties traced by co(@xmath0)/co(@xmath13 ) intensity ratio ( hereafter @xmath14 ) .",
    "the authors found that ngc  4254 has a remarkably uniform @xmath14 of 0.33 , whereas ngc 4569 shows a significant gradient from north to south in @xmath14 ; from 0.53 at the northern co(@xmath0 ) peak to just 0.06 at the southern peak .",
    "@xcite presented the co(@xmath0 ) mapping of three nearby field galaxies ( ngc  628 , ngc  3521 , and ngc  3627 ) , and found that sfe of the dense molecular gas traced by co(@xmath0 ) emission ( i.e. , @xmath15 sfr divided by @xmath2 ) mostly independent or only weakly dependent on molecular gas density , @xmath14 , and the fraction of total gas in molecular form .",
    "@xcite examined the correlation between global @xmath2 and far - ir ( fir ) luminosities ( @xmath16 ) for more than 30 galaxies .",
    "the authors found a remarkably tight @xmath17 correlation among ir - luminous galaxies ( i.e. , @xmath16/@xmath2 ratios are constant among ir - luminous galaxies ) , whereas @xmath16/@xmath2 ratios ( and their scatter ) tend to increase among the fainter galaxies .",
    "another extra - galactic co(@xmath0 ) imaging survey of nearby spiral galaxies has been made using the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste : @xcite ) , and obtained sensitive co(@xmath0 ) images of m  83 @xcite , m  33 @xcite , and ngc  986 @xcite .",
    "we found a linear correlation between co(@xmath0 ) intensities and extinction - corrected h@xmath18 luminosities over the whole disk of m  83 @xcite .",
    "however , in order to reveal the `` universal '' star - formation law in galaxies based on co(@xmath0 ) emission further , it is indispensable to examine its dependence on various galaxy properties and environments , such as density and temperature of molecular gas , metallicity , and the difference between nuclear starbursts and star - forming regions in galaxy disks with an adequate spatial resolution ( @xmath19 1 kpc ) .",
    "we therefore need to increase the number of spatially - resolved studies of the co(@xmath0 ) star - formation law covering whole disks of nearby galaxies with various galaxy properties and environments .    in this paper , we present wide - area co(@xmath0 ) images of nearby non - barred spiral galaxies ngc  628 and ngc  7793 using the aste , employing an on - the - fly ( otf ) mapping mode .",
    "basic parameters of each galaxy are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the distances to ngc  628 and ngc  7793 are estimated to be 7.3 mpc and 3.91 mpc @xcite ; therefore , the effective beam size of aste , @xmath20 , corresponds to 900 pc and 480 pc , respectively .",
    "this enables us to resolve major structures ( i.e. , the center and spiral arms ) at a sub - kpc resolution .",
    "ngc  628 and ngc  7793 are suitable targets to examine a spatially - resolved co(@xmath0 ) star - formation law and to compare it with that in m  83 because the distance to m  83 is estimated to 4.5 mpc @xcite , which is similar to ngc  628 and ngc  7793 . and",
    "more importantly , the star - formation environment in m  83 is different from these two galaxies ; m  83 hosts a nuclear starburst , while ngc  628 and ngc  7793 are normal disk galaxies without strong nuclear activities .",
    "thus , we can investigate the difference in the co(@xmath0 ) star - formation law between the starbursts and star - forming regions in galaxy disks .",
    "these galaxies are rich in multi - wavelength data set to calculate sfrs , such as h@xmath18 and ir images , since these galaxies are the targets of the @xmath21 infrared nearby galaxies survey ( sings : @xcite ) and/or the local volume legacy ( lvl ) survey project @xcite .",
    "the goals of this paper are : ( 1 ) to reveal the global distributions of co(@xmath0 ) emission in ngc  628 and ngc  7793 , ( 2 ) to measure co(@xmath0 ) intensities ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath2 , and examine @xmath14 in these two galaxies , ( 3 ) to examine the spatially - resolved ( sub - kpc ) co(@xmath0 ) star - formation law ( i.e. , @xmath4 and @xmath6 correlations ) for ngc  628 , ngc  7793 , and m  83 , and to compare the obtained co(@xmath0 ) star - formation law with earlier studies , and ( 4 ) to investigate the dependence of the co(@xmath0 ) star - formation law on star - formation environments ( i.e. , the difference among ulirgs , submillimeter selected galaxies , local starbursts , and normal star - forming regions in galaxy disks ) .",
    "co(@xmath0 ) emission observations of ngc  628 and ngc  7793 were performed using the aste 10-m dish from september to october , 2013 , and july to august , 2014 , respectively .",
    "the sizes of co(@xmath0 ) maps are @xmath22 ( 12.8 kpc @xmath23 12.8 kpc ) for ngc  628 and @xmath24 ( 5.8 kpc @xmath23 5.8 kpc ) for ngc  7793 .",
    "the mapped area in each galaxy is indicated in figure  1 .",
    "we used a waveguide - type sideband - separating sis mixer receiver for the single side band ( ssb ) operation , cats345 @xcite .",
    "the typical image rejection ratio of cats345 was estimated to be @xmath25 db at the frequency in which co(@xmath0 ) emission was observed .",
    "the backend we used was a digital autocorrelator system , mac @xcite , which comprises four banks of a 512 mhz wide spectrometer with 1024 spectral channels each .",
    "this arrangement provided a velocity coverage of 440 km s@xmath26 with a velocity resolution of 0.43 km s@xmath26 . since the observations were carried out in excellent atmospheric conditions ( the zenith opacity of 220  ghz ranged from 0.03 to 0.10 ) , the system noise temperature was typically @xmath27 k ( in ssb ) .",
    "we performed the otf mapping along two different directions ( i.e. , scans along the r.a . and decl .",
    "directions ) , and these two data sets were co - added by the basket - weave method @xcite .",
    "we periodically observed co(@xmath0 ) emission of m  17  sw and cw leo to obtain the main beam efficiency @xmath28 in each observing run .",
    "we compared our co(@xmath0 ) spectra with those obtained by cso observations @xcite , and @xmath28 was estimated to be @xmath29 for observing runs in 2013 ( ngc  628 ) and @xmath30 for those in 2014 ( ngc  7793 ) .",
    "the absolute error of the co(@xmath0 ) temperature scale was about @xmath31 20% , mainly due to variations in @xmath28 and the image rejection ratio of the cats345 .",
    "observation parameters are summarized in table  2 .",
    "the data reduction was conducted using the software package nostar , which comprises tools for otf data analysis , developed by naoj @xcite .",
    "the raw data were regridded to 7@xmath1.5 per pixel , giving an effective angular resolution of @xmath32 .",
    "linear baselines were subtracted from the spectra .",
    "in addition , we subtracted third - order baseline from a portion of the spectra whose line width are sufficiently narrow ( @xmath33 40 km s@xmath26 ) , which do not influence line profiles of co(@xmath0 ) emission .",
    "we binned the adjacent channels to a velocity resolution of 5 km s@xmath26 for the co(@xmath0 ) spectra .",
    "finally , 3d data cubes were created . the resultant r.m.s .  noise level ( 1 @xmath34 ) in @xmath35 scale at a beam size of 25@xmath1 ( hpbw ) was typically @xmath36 mk and @xmath37 mk for ngc  628 and ngc  7793 , respectively .",
    "the derived velocity channel maps of co(@xmath0 ) emission in ngc  628 and ngc  7793 are shown in figure  2 and figure  3 , respectively .",
    "no strong concentration of co(@xmath0 ) emission toward central regions are found in either galaxy , which is different from previous our co(@xmath0 ) sample , barred spiral galaxies m  83 and ngc  986 , showing strong peaks at their centers .",
    "we calculated the velocity - integrated intensities of co(@xmath0 ) emission ( i.e. , @xmath5 ) in ngc  628 and ngc  7793 with a noise cut - off level of 2@xmath34 and created their maps as shown in figure  4 .",
    "we successfully obtained the global co(@xmath0 ) distributions at a sub - kpc resolution for both galaxy disks ; we note that this is the first global co image of ngc  7793 at all the transitions .",
    "the co(@xmath0 ) image of ngc  628 is similar to that obtained with the jcmt @xcite , yet our map depicts even co(@xmath0 ) emission extending southward along the spiral arm .",
    "we compare the distributions of co(@xmath0 ) emission with @xmath38/spire 350 @xmath39 emission obtained by the kingfish ( key insights on nearby galaxies : a far - infrared survey with @xmath38 ) project @xcite . in figure  5 , we find a good spatial coincidence between co(@xmath0 ) emission and 350 @xmath39 emission for each galaxy , which suggests the coexistence of the dense molecular medium and the cold dust component .",
    "we summarize the peak intensity of co(@xmath0 ) emission and its location in each galaxy .",
    "for ngc  628 , we found the peak intensity in our co(@xmath0 ) map of 2.7 @xmath31 0.5 k km s@xmath26 in @xmath35 scale at 25@xmath1 resolution .",
    "this peak value occurs at several positions across the map , including the nucleus as well as several local peaks along spiral arms .",
    "according to @xcite , the strongest @xmath5 observed with the jcmt is 3.7 @xmath31 0.5 k km s@xmath26 at 15@xmath1 resolution .",
    "these two values of @xmath5 seem in good agreement if we consider the difference in the angular resolution and the extended distribution of co(@xmath0 ) emission . for ngc  7793",
    ", we found the peak intensity in our co(@xmath0 ) map of 1.5 @xmath31 0.3 k km s@xmath26 in @xmath35 scale at 25@xmath1 resolution , which is observed not at the center but in the disk .",
    "the central @xmath5 is only 0.7 @xmath31 0.1 k km s@xmath26 .",
    "we have calculated the global and central @xmath2 , and compared them with those reported in earlier studies .",
    "the @xmath2 is calculated as follows : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the distance of a galaxy in pc , and @xmath42 is the covered area in rad@xmath43 .",
    "for ngc  628 , we found the global @xmath2 = ( 7.1 @xmath31 1.6 ) @xmath23 @xmath44 k km s@xmath26 pc@xmath43 over the observed @xmath22 region .",
    "this value is slightly higher than that obtained by @xcite , 5.2 @xmath23 @xmath44 k km s@xmath26 pc@xmath43 .",
    "however , their @xmath2 was calculated for a smaller area , @xmath24 .",
    "we recalculated our global @xmath2 over the same @xmath24 region , and found @xmath2 = ( 6.4 @xmath31 1.4 ) @xmath23 @xmath44 k km s@xmath26 pc@xmath43 , which is in agreement with that obtained by @xcite .",
    "in addition , we obtained @xmath2 within the central 1 kpc in ngc  628 of ( 4.3 @xmath31 0.9 ) @xmath23 @xmath45 k km s@xmath26 pc@xmath43 , and found the ratio of the central @xmath2 to the global @xmath2 is only 0.061 .",
    "this is significantly smaller than that obtained in m  83 , 0.22 @xcite .    for ngc  7793",
    ", we found the global @xmath2 = ( 7.4 @xmath31 1.4 ) @xmath23 @xmath45 k km s@xmath26 pc@xmath43 over the observed @xmath24 region , which is an order of magnitude lower than that in ngc  628 .",
    "this is partly because the total h@xmath46 mass in ngc  7793 , @xmath47 ( calculated from the co(@xmath13 ) intensity obtained by @xcite ) , is also an order of magnitude lower than that in ngc  628 , @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "in addition , we obtained @xmath2 = ( 4.2 @xmath31 0.8 ) @xmath23 @xmath49 k km s@xmath26 pc@xmath43 within the central 1 kpc of ngc  7793 , and found the ratio of the central @xmath2 to the global @xmath2 of 0.055 , which is comparable to that in ngc  628 . therefore , the contribution of the central @xmath2 to the global @xmath2 is less than 10 % for these two spiral galaxies without strong nuclear activity .",
    "we examined the correlation between global @xmath2 and @xmath16 for ngc  628 , ngc  7793 , m  83 @xcite , and galaxies in jcmt nearby galaxy legacy survey ( ngls ) sample @xcite .",
    "we calculated @xmath16 of aste sample ( ngc  628 , ngc  7793 , and m  83 ) from the original data presented by @xcite for adopted distance .",
    "figure  6 shows the correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath16 and the variation in @xmath16/@xmath2 as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "our aste sample reinforces the tight correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath16 , and the declining tendency of @xmath16/@xmath2 with the increase in @xmath2 demonstrated by @xcite .      here",
    ", we examine @xmath14 in ngc  628 and ngc  7793 to estimate the average physical condition of molecular gas within the observing beam .",
    "we used the co(@xmath13 ) image in ngc  628 obtained with the berkeley - illinois - maryland association millimeter interferometer survey of nearby galaxies ( bima song : @xcite ) project , which is convolved to an angular resolution of 25@xmath1 to match our co(@xmath0 ) image .",
    "we can obtain @xmath14 only in the central @xmath50 region due to the smaller coverage of the bima co(@xmath13 ) image . according to the pixel - by - pixel comparison of each co map , the obtained @xmath14 are in the range of 0.1 to 1.1 .",
    "we found that @xmath51% of pixels show lower @xmath14 , @xmath52 , regardless of galactocentric distance , and found that the global @xmath14 over the @xmath50 region is estimated to be 0.39 , which are well consistent with those reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that pixels with higher @xmath14 ( @xmath53 1.0 ) are not adjacent each other , i.e. , exist locally .",
    "a similar situation has been observed in m  83 ; the average @xmath14 in the disk ( @xmath54 kpc ) of m  83 is @xmath55 , but there exists some locations where @xmath14 exceed 1.2 @xcite .",
    "such local peaks of @xmath14 are presumably due to the uncertainties and the poor signal - to - noise ratio of both co data .",
    "we compare the obtained @xmath14 in ngc  628 with those in various types of galaxies .",
    "firstly , we summarize @xmath14 in normal spiral galaxies .",
    "the mean @xmath14 are @xmath56 for giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) in the disk of the milky way @xcite , @xmath57 for ngc  4254 and ngc  4321 @xcite , and @xmath58 for the spiral arm of m  51 @xcite .",
    "these values are almost comparable to the global @xmath14 of 0.39 in ngc  628 . in addition",
    ", the distribution of spatially - resolved @xmath14 in m  51 ( @xmath59 : @xcite ) is quite similar to that in ngc  628 ( typically @xmath52 ) .",
    "however , higher @xmath14 have been frequently observed in starburst galaxies .",
    "for example , the central @xmath14 in ngc  253 and m  82 are 0.8 and 1.0 , respectively @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite reported that m  83 shows higher @xmath14 both in the central region ( @xmath60 ) and in the disk ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "this suggests that dense gas fraction traced by @xmath14 in starburst galaxies is higher than that in ngc  628 .",
    "lastly , we compare @xmath14 in ngc  628 and those in early - type galaxies . according to @xcite , single - pointing @xmath14 in early - type galaxies are typically in the range of @xmath61 , which are comparable to that in ngc  628 , while some early - type galaxies ( ngc  7077 and ngc  7679 ) show higher @xmath14 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the reason of such a great difference in @xmath14 among early - type galaxies is unclear , but this is presumably due to the difference in the physical condition of molecular gas in each galaxy .    for ngc  7793",
    ", there is no available co(@xmath13 ) map , but @xcite obtained co(@xmath13 ) spectrum in the central region using the sest 15-m telescope at an angular resolution of @xmath63 . in order to obtain the central @xmath14 , we convolved our co(@xmath0 ) data ( 25@xmath64 ) to the same angular resolution ( 43@xmath64 ) .",
    "the convolved co(@xmath0 ) spectrum in the central region is shown in figure  7 .",
    "the significant emission can be seen in the velocity range of 200 to 300 km s@xmath26 , which is consistent with the central h emission obtained with the nrao very large array @xcite . within this velocity range",
    ", we obtained the central @xmath5 at an angular resolution of @xmath63 of 0.46 @xmath31 0.07 k km s@xmath26 in @xmath35 scale .",
    "we calculated the central co(@xmath13 ) intensity ( @xmath65 ) in the same velocity range as our co(@xmath0 ) emission based on the co(@xmath13 ) spectrum shown in figure  2 of @xcite .",
    "we obtained @xmath65 of 2.7 @xmath31 0.4 k km s@xmath26 , which gives @xmath14 of 0.17 @xmath31 0.06",
    ".    the central @xmath14 in ngc  7793 , 0.17 @xmath31 0.06 , is considerably lower than those reported by earlier studies based on single - pointing observations of external galaxies .",
    "for example , @xcite found that @xmath14 in 28 nearby galaxies are in the range of 0.2 to 0.7 , and @xcite reported that @xmath14 are in the range of 0.2 to 1.9 for their sample including various types of galaxies ; normal , seyfert , starburst galaxies , and luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite found that @xmath14 in dwarf starburst galaxies are in the range of 0.34 to 2.6 , and @xmath14 in compact galaxies are in the range of 0.63 to 1.5 @xcite .",
    "however , such a low @xmath14 ( @xmath33 0.20 ) is sometimes observed as the local minimum in galaxy disks .",
    "in fact , we found the smallest @xmath14 of 0.10 in the inter - arm of ngc  628 as described above .",
    "in addition , @xcite found gmcs with @xmath14 @xmath66 in the second nearest spiral galaxy m  33 .",
    "these gmcs with low @xmath14 are widely distributed over the disk in m  33 , and their masses are small ( typically less than @xmath67 ) .",
    "this suggests that such less massive gmcs ( @xmath68 ) are dominant in the central region of ngc  7793 if we assume the filling factor of co(@xmath0 ) emission is comparable to that of co(@xmath13 ) emission .    some theoretical models are utilized to obtain the physical interpretation of observed @xmath14 . in particular , the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) approximation @xcite and the photo - dissociation region ( pdr ) models ( e.g. , @xcite ) are widely applied to derive physical parameters , such as density ( @xmath69 ) and kinetic temperature ( @xmath70 ) of molecular gas .",
    "for example , if we assume a co fractional abundance per unit velocity gradient @xmath71(@xmath72co)/(@xmath73/@xmath74 ) of @xmath75 and a moderate @xmath70 of 30 k under the lvg approximation with a one - zone assumption , the observed @xmath14 of 0.39 in ngc  628 and 0.17 in ngc  7793 correspond to low @xmath69 of @xmath76 @xmath12 and @xmath77 @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "however , a different physical condition can reproduce the same @xmath14 value under the lvg approximation ; a moderate @xmath69 of @xmath78 @xmath12 and a low @xmath70 of 10 k also yield the @xmath14 of 0.17 .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to decide whether a low @xmath14 of 0.17 observed in ngc  7793 is attributable to the decrease in @xmath69 or that in @xmath70 .",
    "validity of a use of co(@xmath0 ) emission as a dense gas tracer , and its correlation with sfrs and ( f)ir luminosities have been energetically studied by many authors . for example , inclination - corrected @xmath5 were compared with extinction - corrected sfrs for 14 nearby galaxy centers by @xcite .",
    "the authors found the strong correlation between these 2 quantities with a linear slope of 1.0 .",
    "the detailed investigation of the @xmath17 correlation is first performed by @xcite .",
    "they found a superlinear slope of 1.4 for 60 ir luminous galaxies .",
    "however , recent studies reported that the reanalysis of @xcite data yields a linear slope of 1.0 @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite found the nearly linear correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 for 17 starburst spiral galaxies , lirgs , and ulirgs .",

    ", we investigate whether such a linear correlation based on co(@xmath0 ) emission is commonly applicable to each local position in nearby spiral galaxies .",

    "we use the co(@xmath0 ) image of m  83 obtained by @xcite .",
    "in addition , we compare the obtained @xmath4 correlation with global luminosities for jcmt ngls sample @xcite and the best - fit relation , log @xmath3 = ( 1.00 @xmath31 0.05 ) log @xmath2 + ( 2.2 @xmath31 0.5 ) , for the local ( u)lirgs and submillimeter selected dusty star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath3 for jcmt ngls sample from @xcite for adopted distances .",

    "@xcite examined the monochromatic - to - bolometric infrared ratios for globally integrated lvl data .",
    "the authors reported that the @xmath21/mips 70 @xmath39 and 160 @xmath39 emission are tightly coupled to the bolometric ir emission .",
    "indeed , the mean 70 @xmath39-to - total ir ( tir ; @xmath85 @xmath39 ) luminosity ratio is 0.46 with a smaller scatter of 0.11 dex .",
    "thus , we use mips 70 @xmath39 images obtained by the lvl survey to estimate the spatially - resolved @xmath3 for ngc  628 , ngc  7793 , and m  83 .",
    "first , we examined the global 70 @xmath39 luminosity ( @xmath86 ) to @xmath3 ratio ( @xmath86/@xmath3 ) for each galaxy .",
    "the global 70 @xmath39 luminosities are calculated from the integrated mips 70 @xmath39 flux densities summarized by @xcite , and the @xmath3 are obtained from @xcite .",
    "the resultant global @xmath86/@xmath3 are 0.51 , 0.61 , and 0.53 for ngc  628 , ngc  7793 , and m  83 , respectively .",
    "these values are slightly greater than the mean ratio of 0.46 reported by @xcite .",
    "this is because the wavelength range of their tir luminosity ( @xmath87 ; @xmath85 @xmath39 ) is wider than that of @xmath3 ( @xmath83 @xmath39 ) , and thus @xmath87 is definitely greater than @xmath3 ( i.e. , @xmath86/@xmath3 is greater than @xmath86/@xmath87 ) .",
    "then , we converted the spatially - resolved @xmath86 to @xmath3 for each pixel by using the global @xmath86/@xmath3 of each galaxy as a `` scaling '' factor .",
    "note that we can not consider the local variations in @xmath86/@xmath3 within each galaxy disk , and thus we estimated the absolute error of @xmath3 in each pixel of @xmath88% considering the scatter of @xmath86/@xmath87 of 0.11 dex ( @xmath89% ) @xcite .    for the pixel - by - pixel comparison between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we used pixels whose @xmath2 exceed 3 @xmath34 corresponding to @xmath90 k km",
    "s@xmath26 pc@xmath43 , @xmath91 k km s@xmath26 pc@xmath43 , and @xmath92 k km s@xmath26 pc@xmath43 for ngc  628 , ngc  7793 , and m  83 , respectively . in this analysis , we divided m  83 data into two regions according to the galactocentric radius ; the central region ( @xmath93 @xmath19 1 kpc ) and the disk ( @xmath94 1 kpc ) , in order to distinguish the nuclear starburst and star - forming regions in the disk .",
    "figure  8 shows the obtained @xmath4 correlation .",
    "we found a striking linear correlation over the 4 orders of magnitude .",
    "@xmath3 at a given @xmath2 seems typically smaller than the best - fit relation for the sample of @xcite by @xmath61 dex , but is almost within the error of the best - fit relation .",
    "note that we found only weak @xmath4 correlations for ngc  628 and ngc  7793 individually , with spearman rank correlation coefficients of 0.31 and 0.23 , respectively .",
    "this is presumably due to the lack of the dynamic range in @xmath2 , only @xmath95 dex for ngc  628 and ngc  7793 , which is comparable to the scatter in @xmath3 at a given @xmath2 ; therefore , an individual @xmath4 correlation for each galaxy becomes weaker . in order to obtain a strong @xmath4 correlation for an individual galaxy ,",
    "it is necessary to ensure an enough dynamic range in @xmath2 at least an order of magnitude such as m  83 .",
    "the important thing is that almost all data points lie on a single @xmath4 correlation in figure  8 .    in figure  8",
    ", we also found a bimodal correlation for each subsample ; we obtained the best - fit slope for the spatially - resolved sample ( ngc  628 , ngc  7793 , and m  83 ) of 0.84 , and that for the jcmt ngls sample of 0.74 , in spite of the linear @xmath4 correlation for the combined sample .",
    "this is because the luminosities ( both @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) are proportional to the coverer area ( i.e. , @xmath96 in equation 1 ) in a linear scale ( pc@xmath43 ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath96 at sub - kpc resolution of @xmath97 pc@xmath43 is 2 or 3 orders of magnitude smaller than that for a global galaxy disk of @xmath98 pc@xmath43 .",
    "such a difference in @xmath96 among each sample automatically produces the linear @xmath4 correlation for the combined sample over the 3 orders of magnitude even if the slope of @xmath4 correlation for each subsample is sublinear .",
    "the sublinear @xmath4 slope of 0.74 for the jcmt ngls sample is consistent with the declining tendency of @xmath16/@xmath2 ratio with the increase in @xmath2 reported by @xcite ( see also figure  6 ) .",
    "the authors argued that fainter galaxies have lower average co surface brightnesses , in which case they could systematically underestimate the co luminosity due to the low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the @xmath4 slope of 0.84 for our spatially - resolved sample seems slightly smaller than that reported by earlier studies ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "however , we can not discuss its significance yet because the slope of 0.84 is determined for only 3 galaxy sample in this study .",
    "further analyses of the spatially - resolved @xmath4 correlation for more sample are required to determine more reliable @xmath4 slope and to understand its physical meaning in nearby galaxies .",
    "extinction - corrected sfrs are calculated from a linear combination of h@xmath18 and @xmath21/mips 24 @xmath39 luminosities as follows @xcite : @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 mean h@xmath18 and 24 @xmath39 luminosities , respectively .",
    "@xmath102 is the inclination of each galaxy and @xmath103 is the covered area within the 25@xmath64 beam ( in the unit of pc@xmath104 ) .",
    "we used h@xmath18 and 24 @xmath39 images of ngc  7793 obtained by the sings and those of m  83 and ngc  628 by the lvl survey .",
    "figure  9 shows the obtained @xmath6 correlation .",
    "we found a linear correlation between @xmath5 and extinction - corrected sfrs with @xmath7 dex scatter , whereas we also found a larger scatter ( @xmath105 orders of magnitude ) for gmcs in m  33 .",
    "this is presumably due to the small spatial resolution for m  33 .",
    "@xcite reported that gmcs in m  33 are classified into four types according to their evolutional stages ; i.e. , the age of the associated young stellar groups and h regions .",
    "this causes the difference in the estimated sfrs by @xmath106 orders of magnitude for every gmcs .",
    "in addition , the peak positions of co(@xmath0 ) emission for some gmcs are @xmath84 pc away from their associated h regions .",
    "this spatial offset just corresponds to the observing beam of co(@xmath0 ) emission . for these reasons ,",
    "the larger scatter for gmcs in m  33 in figure  9 is observed .",
    "nonetheless , the overall @xmath6 correlation is still robust even if gmcs in m  33 are included .",
    "finally , we note the dependence of the obtained co(@xmath0 ) star - formation law on star - formation environments .",
    "as shown in figure  8 and figure  9 , the @xmath4 and the @xmath6 correlations for the central region of m  83 is well consistent with those for ngc  628 , ngc  7793 , and the disk of m  83 , and is consistent even with those for other sample in earlier studies ( i.e. , ulirgs , submillimeter selected galaxies , whole disks of jcmt ngls sample , 14 nearby galaxy centers , and gmcs in m  33 ) .",
    "we conclude that the co(@xmath0 ) star formation law ( linear @xmath4 and @xmath6 correlations ) is universally applicable to various types and spatial scales of galaxies ; from spatially - resolved nearby galaxy disks to distant ir - luminous galaxies , within @xmath7 dex scatter .",
    "we have performed co(@xmath0 ) emission observations of the @xmath22 ( or 12.8 @xmath23 12.8 kpc at the distance of 7.3 mpc ) region of the nearby spiral galaxy ngc  628 ( m  74 ) and the @xmath24 ( or 5.8 @xmath23 5.8 kpc at the distance of 3.91 mpc ) region of the nearby spiral galaxy ngc  7793 with the aste at an effective angular resolution of 25@xmath1 .",
    "a summary of this work is as follows .    1",
    ".   we successfully obtained global distributions of co(@xmath0 ) emission over the entire disks at a sub - kpc resolution for both galaxies .",
    "in addition , we found that the co(@xmath0 ) emission is well spatially coincident with the @xmath38/spire 350 @xmath39 emission .",
    "we found that the global @xmath2 are ( 7.1 @xmath31 1.6 ) @xmath23 @xmath44 k km s@xmath26 pc@xmath43 for ngc  628 and ( 7.4 @xmath31 1.4 ) @xmath23 @xmath45 k km s@xmath26 pc@xmath43 for ngc  7793 , respectively .",
    "we found that no central concentration of co(@xmath0 ) emission ; the ratios of the central ( @xmath107 kpc ) @xmath2 to the global @xmath2 are only @xmath108 for both galaxies .",
    "we found the average @xmath14 in ngc  628 of 0.39 , which may be a typical value in galaxy disks according to the comparison with earlier studies for galactic and extragalactic objects . on the other hand",
    ", we found the central @xmath14 at 43@xmath64 resolution in ngc  7793 of 0.17 .",
    "such a low @xmath14 was observed for less massive ( @xmath68 ) gmcs in the disk of m  33 , which suggests that such less massive gmcs are dominant in the central region of ngc  7793 .",
