    "the determination of the equation of state of isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter has been a longstanding goal shared by both nuclear physics and astrophysics @xcite .",
    "usually one assumes a parabolic form for the energy per nucleon at zero temperature , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the total nucleon density and @xmath12 is the isospin asymmetry related to unequal proton and neutron densities @xmath13 .",
    "the validity of the quadratic approximation has been verified with good numerical accuracy from isospin - symmetric nuclear matter @xmath14 up to pure neutron matter @xmath15 by most of the existing nuclear many - body theories using various interactions @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it has been shown consistently in numerous studies @xcite that for some properties of neutron stars , such as the proton fraction at beta - equilibrium , the core - crust transition density and the critical density for the direct urca process to occur , even a very small quartic isospin asymmetry energy @xmath16 ( multiplied with @xmath17 in the expansion of the energy per nucleon ) can make a big difference .",
    "given the fact that all the available numerical solutions of the nuclear many - body problem confirm the validity of the quadratic approximation , the quartic isospin asymmetry @xmath16 should be rather small .",
    "however , in the recent work by cai and li @xcite , which employs an empirically constrained isospin - dependent single - nucleon momentum - distribution and the equation of state of pure neutron matter near the unitary limit , a significant quartic isospin asymmetry energy of @xmath18mev has been found .",
    "this value amounts to about 16 times the free fermi gas prediction , see eq.(2 ) . on the other hand , the calculations by the darmstadt group @xcite based on chiral low - momentum interactions and many - body perturbation theory lead to a small value of @xmath19mev .    the purpose of the present paper it to give a prediction for the density - dependent quartic isospin asymmetry energy @xmath0 in the chiral approach to nuclear matter developed in refs.@xcite . in this approach",
    "the long- and medium - range nn - interactions arising from multi - pion exchange are treated explicitly and few parameters encoding the relevant short - distance dynamics are adjusted to bulk properties of nuclear matter .",
    "single - particle potentials @xcite , quasi - particle interactions @xcite , the thermodynamic behavior of nuclear matter at finite temperatures @xcite and the density - dependence of the in - medium quark condensate @xcite follow then as predictions in that framework ( see also the recent review article @xcite ) .    the present paper is organized as follows . in section2 ,",
    "analytical expressions are given for the contributions to the quartic isospin asymmetry energy @xmath0 as they arise from @xmath1-exchange and chiral @xmath2-exchange .",
    "the three - nucleon interaction generated by @xmath2-exchange and excitation of a virtual @xmath3-isobar is considered as well .",
    "these interaction contributions lead at saturation density @xmath4@xmath5 ( or @xmath20mev ) to the ( small ) value @xmath21mev , which amounts to about three times the kinetic energy part .",
    "moreover , in the course of the calculation one encounters components of the second - order @xmath1-exchange whose representation of the fourth derivative with the respect to @xmath7 at @xmath22 is singular . in section3 ,",
    "the generic presence of a non - analytical term @xmath9 in the expansion of the energy per particle of isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter is demonstrated by calculating in closed form the second - order contribution from a s - wave contact - interaction .",
    "clearly , after having established its existence , the non - analytical term @xmath23 should be included in future fits of the equation of state of ( zero - temperature ) isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "in this section we collect the expressions for the quartic isospin asymmetry @xmath0 as they arise from one - pion and two - pion exchange diagrams following refs.@xcite .",
    "isospin - asymmetric ( spin - saturated ) nuclear matter is characterized by different proton and neutron fermi momenta , @xmath24 . expanding the energy per particle at fixed nucleon density @xmath25 in the isospin asymmetry parameter",
    "@xmath7 up to fourth order gives : @xmath26 with @xmath27 the ( usual ) quadratic isospin asymmetry energy .",
    "we view the density - dependent expansion coefficients @xmath28 and @xmath0 as functions of the fermi momentum @xmath29 , since they emerge in this form directly from the calculation .",
    "the first contribution to @xmath0 comes from the relativistically improved kinetic energy @xmath30 , and it reads : @xmath31 with @xmath32mev the average nucleon mass .",
    "the corresponding value at nuclear matter saturation density @xmath4@xmath5 ( or @xmath20mev ) is @xmath33mev .",
    "for the treatment of two - body interactions that depend on the momentum transfer @xmath34 the following expansion formulas for integrals over two fermi spheres are most helpful : @xmath35\\nonumber \\\\ & & = { 2k_f^6 \\over 3\\pi^4 } \\int_0 ^ 1\\!\\!dz \\bigg\\{\\bigg[z^2(1-z)^2(2+z ) + { \\delta^2z^3",

    "the contribution of the @xmath1-exchange fock diagram to the quartic isospin asymmetry energy reads : @xmath39\\bigg\\ } \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the dimensionless variable @xmath40 . the second line in eq.(5 ) gives the relativistic @xmath41-correction .",
    "the occurring physical parameters are : nucleon axial - vector coupling constant @xmath42 , ( neutral ) pion mass @xmath43mev , and pion decay constant @xmath44mev .",
    "next in the chiral expansion comes the iterated ( second - order ) @xmath1-exchange . with two medium insertions @xmath45 one gets a hartree contribution of the form : @xmath46 and",
    "the corresponding fock exchange - term reads : @xmath47 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\int_0^u \\!\\!dx \\,{21x^2 - 16u^2   \\over 6u(1 + 2x^2)}\\big[(1 + 8x^2 + 8x^4)\\arctan x-(1 + 4x^2)\\arctan 2x \\big]\\bigg\\ } \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] pauli - blocking effects at second order are included through diagrams with three ( isospin - asymmetric ) medium insertions @xcite .",
    "we consider here only the factorizable fock contribution for which the energy denominator gets canceled by factors from the momentum - dependent @xmath48-vertices ( see eqs.(11,26 ) in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "its contribution to the quartic isospin asymmetry energy can be represented as a one - parameter integral , @xmath49 , where the lengthy integrand @xmath50 involves the function @xmath51-\\ln[1+(u - x)^2 ] $ ] and its square .",
    "the corresponding value at saturation density is @xmath52mev , thus counterbalancing most of the fock term @xmath53mev without pauli - blocking written in eq.(7 ) . for the non - factorizable pieces the representation of the fourth derivative with respect to @xmath7 at @xmath22 includes singularities of the form @xmath54 . when subtracting these singular terms from the integrand only very small numerical values are obtained for the non - factorizable hartree contribution . in the case of the quadratic isospin asymmetry energy @xmath55",
    "one finds that the non - factorizable pieces ( see eqs.(24,26 ) in ref.@xcite ) tend to cancel each other almost completely as : @xmath56mev .",
    "therefore one can expect that the omission of the non - factorizable pieces does not change much the final result for the quartic isospin asymmetry energy @xmath0 .",
    "however , the observation that the iterated @xmath1-exchange has components with a singular representation of their fourth derivative with respect to @xmath7 at @xmath57 , indicates that the expansion in eq.(1 ) becomes non - analytic beyond the quadratic order @xmath38 .",
    "this feature is demonstrated in section3 by calculating in closed form the second - order contribution from a s - wave contact - interaction .",
    "we continue with the contribution of the irreducible @xmath2-exchange to the quartic isospin asymmetry energy . using a twice - subtracted dispersion relation for the @xmath2-exchange nn - potential in momentum - space and the master formulas in eqs.(3,4 ) ,",
    "one obtains : @xmath58   + { \\rm i m } ( w_c+2\\mu^2w_t ) \\bigg[{2k_f^5",

    "these imaginary parts are composed of the functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 , with @xmath63mev the delta - nucleon mass splitting .",
    "note that due to the implemented subtractions the @xmath29-expansion of @xmath64 in eq.(8 ) starts with the power @xmath65 .",
    "a short - distance contribution proportional to @xmath66 is supplemented by the subtraction constants : @xmath67 with the parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 adjusted in ref.@xcite to the empirical nuclear matter saturation point and quadratic isospin asymmetry energy @xmath70mev .    finally , we consider the long - range three - nucleon interaction generated by @xmath2-exchange and virtual excitation of a @xmath3-isobar @xcite .",
    "the corresponding three - body hartree contribution reads : @xmath71 while the associated three - body fock term can be represented as @xmath72 , where the lengthy integrand @xmath73 involves the functions @xmath74 and @xmath51-\\ln[1+(u - x)^2]$ ] .",
    "note that the three - body contact - term proportional to @xmath75 introduced additionally in ref.@xcite does not contribute to the quartic isospin asymmetry energy @xmath0 .     as a function of the nucleon density @xmath76 . ]",
    "summing up all the calculated contributions , one obtains the result for the density - dependent quartic isospin asymmetry energy @xmath0 of nuclear matter as shown in fig.1 in the density region @xmath77@xmath5 .",
    "the predicted value at saturation density @xmath4@xmath5 is @xmath78mev .",
    "it amounts to @xmath79 times the free fermi - gas part @xmath80mev .",
    "note that interaction contributions to @xmath0 start ( at least ) with the power @xmath66 .",
    "the density - dependence of the full line in fig.1 is to a good approximation @xmath81 .",
    "actually , it should be noted that the present calculation of the quartic isospin asymmetry energy @xmath0 is performed in a framework where empirical constraints from bulk properties of nuclear matter are satisfied .",
    "this does not apply to the recent work in ref.@xcite , where a large value of @xmath82mev has been found .",
    "the analysis of the pauli - blocking corrections to the second - order ( iterated ) @xmath1-exchange has indicated that non - analytical terms may occur in the @xmath7-expansion of the energy per particle of isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter beyond the quadratic order . in the extreme case",
    "there could be a cubic term @xmath83 , which is after all even under the exchange of protons and neutrons : @xmath84 . in order to clarify the situation",
    ", we consider a s - wave contact interaction : @xmath85\\,,\\ ] ] and examine it in second - order many - body perturbation theory .",
    "for this simple interaction , the occurring integrals over three fermi spheres with ( at most ) two different radii @xmath86 can be solved in closed analytical form . the pertinent function to express the result in the isospin - asymmetric configuration of interest is : @xmath87 where the variable @xmath88 is set to a ratio of fermi momenta , @xmath89^{\\pm 1/3}$ ] or @xmath90 .",
    "note that the function defined in eq.(12 ) has at @xmath91 the value @xmath92 . combining the second - order hartree and fock diagrams generated by @xmath93 according to their spin- and isospin - factors and performing the expansion in powers of @xmath7 , one obtains the following result for the energy per particle : @xmath94 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + { \\delta^4 \\over 81 }   \\bigg[a_s^2 \\bigg ( 10 \\ln { |\\delta|\\over 3 } + 2\\ln 2 -{41 \\over 6}\\bigg )   + a_t^2 \\bigg(30 \\ln { |\\delta|\\over 3}+2\\ln 2 + { 3\\over 2}\\bigg ) \\bigg ] + { \\cal o}(\\delta^6 ) \\bigg\\}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the crucial and novel feature which becomes evident from this expression is the presence of the non - analytical logarithmic term @xmath95 .",
    "interestingly , the corresponding coefficient is three times as large in the spin - triplet channel as in the spin - singlet channel . for comparison the first - order contribution of",
    "the s - wave contact interaction @xmath93 reads , @xmath96 /2\\pi m$ ] , without any higher powers of @xmath7 .",
    "note that the sign - convention for the scattering lengths @xmath97 is chosen here such that positive values correspond to attraction . as a check we have rederived the same results at first and second order by using the alternative ( and equivalent ) form of the s - wave contact interaction @xmath98/m$ ] .",
    "in fig.2 the dependence of the second - order energy per particle @xmath99 on the isospin asymmetry parameter @xmath100 is shown for three different choices of the s - wave scattering lengths : @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 . in each case",
    "the full line shows the exact result and the ( nearby ) dashed line gives the expansion in powers of @xmath7 truncated at fourth order according to eq.(13 ) .",
    "one observes that these expansions reproduce the full @xmath7-dependence very well over the whole range @xmath104 .",
    "note also that the prefactor @xmath105 of dimension energy has been scaled out in fig.2 .",
    "if one performs for the second - order energy density the fourth derivative with respect to @xmath7 at @xmath22 under the integral , then one encounters integrands with singularities of the form @xmath107 .",
    "the origin of these singularities , or in the proper treatment the non - analytical term @xmath95 , lies in the energy denominator of second - order diagrams . for an infinite ( normal )",
    "many - fermion system the energy spectrum has a vanishing gap between bound states in the fermi sea and excited states in the continuum .",
    "such a gap - less energy spectrum causes a singularity , respectively a non - analyticity , if small asymmetries of the fermi levels of two components are analyzed with too high resolution .    in summary",
    ", we have demonstrated that the non - analytical term @xmath108 will be generically present in calculations of isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter that go beyond the mean - field hartree - fock level .",
    "therefore , a term @xmath9 should be included in future fits of the equation of state of ( zero - temperature ) isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter and its role should be further examined .",
