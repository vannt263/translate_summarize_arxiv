    "first indications for the existence of dark matter were already found in the 1930s @xcite . by",
    "now there is strong evidence @xcite-@xcite to believe that a large fraction ( more than 80% ) of all matter in the universe is dark ( i.e. , interacts at most very weakly with electromagnetic radiation and ordinary matter ) .",
    "the dominant component of this cosmological dark matter must be due to some yet to be discovered , non  baryonic particles . weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) @xmath8 are one of the leading candidates for dark matter .",
    "wimps are stable particles which arise in several extensions of the standard model of electroweak interactions .",
    "typically they are presumed to have masses between 10 gev and a few tev and interact with ordinary matter only weakly ( for reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "currently , the most promising method to detect many different wimp candidates is the direct detection of the recoil energy deposited in a low  background laboratory detector by elastic scattering of ambient wimps on the target nuclei @xcite . the recoil energy spectrum can be calculated from an integral over the one  dimensional wimp velocity distribution @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the absolute value of the wimp velocity in the laboratory frame .",
    "if this function is known , the wimp mass @xmath0 can be obtained from a one  parameter fit to the normalized recoil spectrum @xcite , once a positive wimp signal has been found . however , this introduces a systematic uncertainty which is difficult to control .",
    "we remind the reader that @xmath11body simulations of the spatial distribution of cold dark matter ( which includes wimps ) seem to be at odds with observations at least in the central region of galaxies @xcite ; this may have ramifications for @xmath12 as well . on the theory side , several modifications of",
    "the standard `` shifted maxwellian '' distribution @xcite have been suggested , ranging from co or counter  rotating halos @xcite to scenarios where the three  dimensional wimp velocity distribution gets large contributions from discrete `` streams '' with ( nearly ) fixed velocity @xcite .",
    "the goal of our work is to develop model ",
    "independent methods which allow to determine @xmath0 directly from ( future ) experimental data .",
    "this builds on our earlier work @xcite , where we showed how to determine ( moments of ) @xmath9 from the recoil spectrum in direct wimp detection experiments . in this earlier analysis @xmath0",
    "had been the only input required ; one does not need to know the wimp  nucleus scattering cross section , nor the local wimp density .",
    "the fact that this method will give a result for @xmath12 for any assumed value of @xmath0 already tells us that one will need at least two different experiments , with different target nuclei , to model  independently determine the wimp mass from direct detection experiments .",
    "to do so , one simply requires that the values of a given moment of @xmath12 determined by both experiments agree .",
    "this leads to a simple expression for @xmath0 , which can easily be solved analytically ; note that each moment can be used .",
    "an additional expression for @xmath0 can be derived under the assumption that the ratio of scattering cross sections on protons and neutrons is known .",
    "this is true e.g. , for spin ",
    "independent scattering of a supersymmetric neutralino , which is the perhaps best motivated wimp candidate @xcite ; in this case the spin  independent cross section for scattering on a proton is almost the same as that for scattering on a neutron .",
    "not surprisingly , the best result obtains by combining measurements of several moments with that derived from the assumption about the ratio of cross sections .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows . in sec .  2 we review briefly the methods for estimating the moments of the velocity distribution function , paying special attention to experimentally imposed limits on the range of allowed recoil energies .",
    "in sec .  3 we will present the formalism for determining the wimp mass . numerical results , based on monte carlo simulations of future experiments , will be presented in sec .",
    "we conclude in sec .  5 .",
    "some technical details of our calculation will be given in an appendix .",
    "in this section we review briefly the method for estimating the moments of the one  dimensional velocity distribution function @xmath12 of wimps from the elastic wimp  nucleus scattering data .",
    "we first discuss the formalism , and then describe how it can be implemented directly using ( simulated , or future real ) data from direct wimp search experiments .",
    "our analysis starts from the basic expression for the differential rate for elastic wimp  nucleus scattering @xcite : [ eqn2101 ] = dv . here",
    "@xmath13 is the direct detection event rate , i.e. , the number of events per unit time and unit mass of detector material , @xmath14 is the energy deposited in the detector , @xmath15 is the elastic nuclear form factor , and @xmath10 is the absolute value of the wimp velocity in the laboratory frame . the constant coefficient @xmath16 is defined as [ eqn2102 ] , where @xmath17 is the wimp density near the earth and @xmath18 is the total cross section ignoring the form factor suppression . the reduced mass @xmath19 is defined as [ eqn2103 ] m_r , n , where @xmath20 is the wimp mass and @xmath21 that of the target nucleus .",
    "finally , @xmath22 is the minimal incoming velocity of incident wimps that can deposit the energy @xmath14 in the detector : [ eqn2104 ] = , where we define [ eqn2105 ] .",
    "eq.([eqn2101 ] ) can be solved for @xmath12 @xcite : [ eqn2106 ] f_1(v ) = , where the normalization constant @xmath23 is given by [ eqn2107 ] = ^-1 .",
    "note that , first , because @xmath9 in eq.([eqn2106 ] ) is the _",
    "normalized _ velocity distribution , the normalization constant @xmath24 here is _",
    "independent _ of the constant coefficient @xmath25 defined in eq.([eqn2102 ] ) .",
    "second , the integral here goes over the entire physically allowed range of recoil energies , starting at @xmath26 .",
    "the upper limit of the integral has been written as @xmath27 .",
    "however , it is usually assumed that the wimp flux on earth is negligible at velocities exceeding the escape velocity .",
    "this leads to a kinematic maximum of the recoil energy , [ qmaxkin ] q_max , kin = , where @xmath28 has been given in eq.([eqn2105 ] ) .",
    "eq.([eqn2107 ] ) then implies [ fnorm ] _ 0^f_1(v ) ~ dv = _ 0^v_esc",
    "f_1(v ) ~ dv = 1 . using eq.([eqn2106 ] ) , the moments of @xmath12 can be expressed as @xcite [ eqn2108 ] = _ 0^v_esc v^n f_1(v ) ~ dv = ( n+1 ) i_n , which holds for all @xmath29 . here",
    "the integral @xmath30 is given by [ eqn2110 ] i_n = _ 0^q_max , kin q^(n-1)/2 dq .",
    "in this notation , eq.([eqn2107 ] ) can be re  written as @xmath31 .",
    "the results in eqs.([eqn2106 ] ) and ( [ eqn2108 ] ) depend on the wimp mass @xmath32 only through the coefficient @xmath28 defined in eq.([eqn2105 ] ) .",
    "evidently any ( assumed ) value of @xmath0 will lead to a well  defined , normalized distribution function @xmath12 when used in eq.([eqn2106 ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath0 can be extracted from a _ single _ recoil spectrum _ only if _ one makes some assumptions about the velocity distribution @xmath9 .",
    "a model  independent determination of @xmath0 thus requires that at least two different recoil spectra , with two different target nuclei , have been measured . as we will show in detail in the next section , @xmath0",
    "can then be obtained from the requirement that these two spectra lead to the same moments of @xmath12 .    before coming to that",
    ", we have to incorporate the effects of a finite energy acceptance of the detector .",
    "any real detector will have a certain threshold energy @xmath33 below which it can not register events . off ",
    "line one may need to impose a cut @xmath34 in order to suppress ( instrumental or physical ) backgrounds .",
    "similarly , background rejection may require a maximum energy cut , @xmath35 .",
    "in fact , we will see below that , at least for smallish data samples , such a cut might even be beneficial for the determination of @xmath0 .",
    "we therefore now give expressions for the case that only data with @xmath36 are used in the analysis .    to that end",
    ", we introduce generalized moments of @xmath12 : [ momnew ] ( v_1 , v_2 ) = _ v_1^v_2 v^n",
    "f_1(v ) ~ dv + n ^n+1 , where we have introduced the short  hand notation [ r ] r(q_i ) = .",
    "q^(n-1)/2 dq .",
    "in order to arrive at the final expression in eq.([momnew ] ) we used eq.([eqn2106 ] ) and integrated by parts .",
    "the @xmath37 in eqs.([momnew])([in ] ) are related to the original integration limits @xmath38 appearing on the left ",
    "hand side of eq.([momnew ] ) via eq.([eqn2104 ] ) , i.e. , [ qi ] q_i = ,   i=1 ,  2 .",
    "of course , eq.([momnew ] ) reduces to eq.([eqn2108 ] ) in the limit @xmath39 ; note , however , that eq.([momnew ] ) is also applicable for the case @xmath40 , where the last term on the right  hand side vanishes .",
    "the same restriction on the wimp velocity can also be introduced in the normalization constant @xmath41 of eq.([eqn2107 ] ) , in which case @xmath42 is normalized to unity .",
    "formally this can be treated using eqs.([momnew])([qi ] ) by demanding @xmath43 .      in order",
    "to directly use our results for @xmath9 and for its moments @xmath44 given in eqs.([eqn2106 ] ) , ( [ eqn2108 ] ) and ( [ momnew ] ) , one needs a functional form for the recoil spectrum @xmath45 . in practice this results usually from a fit to experimental data .",
    "however , data fitting can re  introduce some model dependence and makes the error analysis more complicated .",
    "hence , expressions that allow to reconstruct @xmath9 and its moments directly from the data have been developed @xcite .",
    "we started by considering experimental data described by [ eqn2201 ] q_n- ,   i = 1 ,  2 ,  ,  n_n ,   n = 1 ,  2 ,  ,  b. here the total energy range has been divided into @xmath46 bins with central points @xmath47 and widths @xmath48 .",
    "in each bin , @xmath49 events will be recorded .",
    "note that we assume that the sample to be analyzed only contains signal events , i.e. , is free of background , and ignore the uncertainty on the measurement of the recoil energy @xmath14 .",
    "active background suppression techniques @xcite should make the former possible .",
    "the energy resolution of most existing detectors is so good that its error will be negligible compared to the statistical uncertainty for the foreseeable future .",
    "since the recoil spectrum @xmath45 is expected to be approximately exponential , we used the following ansatz for the spectrum in the @xmath50th bin @xcite : [ eqn2202 ] _ n _ q q_n e^k_n ( q - q_n ) e^k_n ( q - q_s , n ) . here",
    "@xmath51 is the standard estimator for @xmath45 at @xmath52 , [ eqn2203 ] r_n = , @xmath53 is the value of the recoil spectrum at the point @xmath52 , [ eqn2204 ] _ q = q_n = r_n , and @xmath54 is the logarithmic slope of the recoil spectrum in the @xmath50th bin .",
    "it can be computed numerically from the average @xmath55value in the @xmath50th bin : [ eqn2205 ] = - , where [ eqn2206 ] ^ . finally , @xmath56 is the shifted point at which the leading systematic error due to the ansatz in eq.([eqn2202 ] ) is minimal @xcite , [ eqn2207 ] q_s ,",

    "we have implicitly assumed that @xmath60 is so large that terms @xmath61 are negligible .",
    "we will see later that this is not necessarily true for @xmath62 , since these moments receive sizable contributions from large recoil energies @xcite .",
    "nevertheless we will show in sec .  3 that even in that case , eq.([eqn2208 ] ) can still be used for determining @xmath0 . from the ansatz eq.([eqn2202 ] )",
    ", the counting rate at @xmath63 can be expressed as [ eqn2209 ] r(q_min ) = r_1 e^k_1 ( q_min - q_s,1 ) . the integral @xmath64 defined in eq.([in ] ) can be estimated through the sum : [ eqn2210 ] i_n(q_min , q_max ) = _ a , where the sum runs over all events in the data set that satisfy @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "since all @xmath30 are determined from the same data , they are correlated , with @xcite [ eqn2211 ] cov(i_n , i_m ) = _ a , where the sum again runs over all events with recoil energy between @xmath66 and @xmath67 .    on the other hand ,",

    "we are now ready to describe methods to extract the wimp mass @xmath0 from direct detection data .",
    "recall that @xmath0 is an _ input _ in the determination of @xmath12 and its moments as described in the previous section .",
    "in particular , @xmath0 appears in the factor @xmath73 on the right  hand side of eq.([eqn2208 ] ) describing the experimental estimate of the moments of @xmath12 . a truly model ",
    "independent determination of @xmath0 from these data will therefore only be possible by requiring that two ( or more ) experiments , using different target nuclei , lead to the same result for @xmath12 .",

    "trivial information about the former can already be obtained with @xmath74 events @xcite .",
    "we will also show how @xmath0 can be estimated from the knowledge of the integral @xmath75 appearing in the normalization of @xmath12 , if the ratio of wimp scattering cross sections on protons and neutrons is known . for greater clarity",
    ", we will first discuss the idealized situation where all signal events , irrespective of their recoil energy @xmath76 , are included . in the second subsection",
    "we will introduce upper and lower limits on @xmath76 .",

    "this factor always dropped out in the end , due to the appearance of the normalization @xmath41 .",
    "this is true also for the right  hand side of eq.([rqmin ] ) , but not for the @xmath105 factor on the left  hand side of this equation ; hence a factor @xmath106 appears in the numerator of eq.([one ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath106 is dimensionless in natural units . on the other hand , the unknown factor @xmath107 appearing in eq.([one ] ) will cancel out when we use this identity for two different targets @xmath86 and @xmath87 , leading to the final result [ msigma ] m_= .",
    "here we have assumed @xmath108 , and introduced the quantity [ rsigma ] r_= .",
    "recall that , even though the derivation started from the expression for the counting rate at @xmath63 , this rate actually dropped out when going from eq.([rqmin ] ) to eq.([one ] ) .",
    "the final expression only depends on the quantity @xmath109 , which is estimated from _ all _ the events in both samples using eq.([eqn2210 ] ) .",
    "the error on @xmath0 computed from eq.([msigma ] ) is therefore comparable to that for @xmath0 derived from a moment of @xmath12 . still keeping @xmath101 , we have [ sigsig ] .",
    "( m _ ) | _ = ^1/2 . ultimately the @xmath110 and",
    "the errors in eqs.([eqn3105 ] ) and ( [ sigsig ] ) should be estimated from the data directly . in the meantime",
    "it is instructive to note that the final expressions for the statistical errors of our estimators for @xmath0 decompose into two factors .",
    "the expectation value of the first factor does not depend on @xmath12 ; it can be computed entirely from the masses of the involved particles : [ kappa ] = + = + .",
    "here we have made use of the identities @xmath111 in eq.([eqn3104 ] ) and _ = ( ) ^5/2 , which hold for the expectation values of these quantities as can be seen from eqs.([eqn3103 ] ) and ( [ msigma ] ) .",
    "remarkably , the expectation values of the factors in front of the expressions in square brackets are in fact the same in eqs.([eqn3105 ] ) and ( [ sigsig ] ) , apart from the factor @xmath112 appearing in the former equation .",
    "on the other hand , the expressions inside these square parentheses do depend on @xmath9 , as well as on the involved masses and form factors .",
    "it is nevertheless instructive to study the behavior of the factor @xmath113 for different target nuclei @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "this largely determines what choice of targets is optimal , i.e. , minimizes the statistical errors of our estimators of @xmath0 .",
    "it is easy to see that the ratio @xmath114 , which will appear in the relative error @xmath115 , only depends on the dimensionless ratios @xmath116 and @xmath117 . in fig .  1 we therefore show contours of @xmath114 in the plane spanned by these two ratios , using the ordering @xmath118 .",
    "we note first of all that @xmath113 diverges as @xmath119 .",
    "this is clear from the fact that the denominator in the final expression in eq.([kappa ] ) vanishes in this limit , while the numerator is finite .",
    "physically this simply means that performing two scattering experiments with the same target will not allow one to determine @xmath0 .",
    "[ fig : contour ]    slightly less trivially , we also see that @xmath114 , and hence the relative error on @xmath0 , becomes very large if both target nuclei are either much heavier or both much lighter than the wimp .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that @xmath0 only enters via the reduced mass defined in eq.([eqn2103 ] ) . )",
    "seems to have additional @xmath0 dependence .",
    "however , this comes from the factor @xmath120 , which drops out when the ratio of two targets is considered . ] if @xmath121 becomes completely independent of the wimp mass . in the opposite extreme ,",
    "@xmath122 becomes independent of the mass of the target nucleus , i.e. , one is effectively back in the situation where both experiments are performed with the same target .",
    "these considerations favor chosing the two targets to be as different as possible .",
    "however , there are limits to this . on the one hand , taking a very light target nucleus will lead to a low event rate for this experiment , and hence very large statistical errors . since the errors of both experiments are added in quadrature inside the expressions in square parenthesis in eqs.([eqn3105 ] ) and ( [ sigsig ] ) , this would lead to a large overall error on @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , if the total event number is held fixed , the final error on @xmath0 will be minimal if both experiments contain approximately the same number of events .",
    "on the other hand , taking a very heavy target nucleus also leads to problems .",
    "heavy nuclei are large , which means they have quite soft form factors .",
    "for example , the woods ",
    "saxon prediction @xcite for the form factor for @xmath123xe , which is the target in some existing experiments @xcite , has a zero at @xmath124 kev . for our default choice @xmath125 km",
    "/ s , this is below @xmath126 of eq.([qmaxkin ] ) for all @xmath127 gev .",
    "this is a serious problem , since the form factor , and hence the event rate , remain ( very ) small even beyond this zero .",
    "experiments with @xmath123xe therefore effectively impose a cut @xmath128 gev .",
    "remain finite where the form factor vanishes , the estimates for the errors will diverge there , due to the factor @xmath129 appearing in eq.([eqn2211 ] ) . ]    from these considerations it seems that chosing @xmath130 si , @xmath131 ge might be a good compromise .",
    "this corresponds to points on the upper , thin solid straight line in fig .  1 .",
    "we see that in this case @xmath132 for all values of @xmath0 .",
    "not surprisingly , @xmath114 reaches its minimum when @xmath0 lies in between the masses of the two target nuclei , i.e for the case at hand , for @xmath133 gev .",
    "note also that @xmath114 is unfortunately always well above unity .",
    "one will thus have to get fairly accurate estimates of the relevant integrals @xmath71 if one wishes to determine @xmath0 to better than a factor of two .    before discussing the statistical uncertainty in more detail ,",
    "we proceed to include non  trivial upper and lower cuts on the recoil energy in our analysis .",
    "as noted earlier , real experiments will probably have to impose both lower and upper limits on the recoil energy , partly for instrumental reasons , and partly to suppress backgrounds .",
    "this led us to introduce generalized moments of @xmath12 in eq.([momnew ] ) .",
    "these moments determined by two different detectors will still be the same , if either the integration limits are identical , , @xmath134 , or the cuts are so loose that the contribution from wimps with @xmath135 or @xmath136 is negligible ; a combination of these two possibilities can also occur , e.g. , small but not necessarily equal values of @xmath137 and @xmath138 , and @xmath139 significantly below @xmath140 .",
    "the crucial observation that forms the basis for our analysis of @xmath0 as estimated from the generalized moments is that in fact _ all three _ terms in the final expression in eq.([momnew ] ) will agree _ separately _ between two targets , as long as both integration limits coincide .",
    "this can be shown by replacing the @xmath141 in eq.([momnew ] ) via eq.([eqn2101 ] ) and using eq.([qi ] ) . in principle",
    "we could therefore simply equate the last ( integral ) terms between the two targets .",
    "this would lead to expressions very similar to those derived in the previous subsection , the only difference being that all integrals or sums over recoil energies would run over limited ranges .",
    "the problem with this approach is that the velocities @xmath38 appearing in eq.([momnew ] ) are not directly observable .",
    "the recoil energies are .",
    "however , the values of @xmath63 and @xmath67 would need to be _ different _ for the two targets , if they are to correspond to the same values of @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "worse , eq.([qi ] ) shows that the ratios @xmath144 and @xmath145 that one has to chose in order to achieve @xmath146 depend on @xmath0 .",
    "we are thus faced with the situation that , in the presence of significant cuts on the recoil energy , the quantity we wish to determine is needed as an input at an early stage of the analysis !    this statement is , strictly speaking , true ; we see no way around this , if significant cuts on the recoil energy are indeed needed .",
    "however , we can alleviate the situation . to begin with",
    ", we noticed that the systematic error one introduces by simply setting @xmath147 is reduced greatly if one keeps the sum of the first and third terms in eq.([momnew ] ) .",
    "moreover , we will show that , to some extent at least , one can do the matching of two @xmath67 values for the two targets directly from the data . in principle",
    "we could reduce the systematic error associated with the choice of @xmath67 even more by also including the second term in eq.([momnew ] ) .",
    "however , with limited statistics the error on @xmath148 will always be very large , so that keeping this term will not help significantly .",

    "for very large @xmath0 the median reconstructed wimp mass even becomes independent of its true value ; this is true also for the upper end of the error band .",
    "this systematic shift presents another argument in favor of imposing an upper cut @xmath67 on @xmath14 , chosen sufficiently low that an average experiment will still have a few events not too far below @xmath67 .",

    "we see that now the median reconstructed @xmath0 indeed tracks the input value even for very large wimp masses .",
    "it should be noted that these results still only use 50 events on average per experiment _ before cuts_. for example , for @xmath208 gev eq.([match ] ) with @xmath209 kev implies @xmath210 kev , meaning that the expected number of events in the si experiments is only about 21 .",
    "this explains why the error bands at large values of @xmath0 are significantly wider here than in fig .  3 where no cuts on the recoil energy have been imposed .",
    "of course , the systematic deviation of the reconstructed @xmath0 from its true value makes the error bands in fig .  3 largely meaningless for @xmath211 gev .",

    "the fact that this fraction decreases from nearly 90% for the smaller events samples to about 85% for the larger samples indicates that our error estimates become a bit more reliable for larger event numbers . , indicating a very slow approach to the gaussian value of about 68% . ]",
    "note also that the secondary peak at @xmath257 is due to the change of denominator in the definition ( [ delm ] ) .",
    "we already saw in figs .",
    "8 and 11 that setting @xmath258 kev significantly under  estimates the true wimp mass if the latter exceeds 100 gev .",
    "this is borne out by figs .  13 .",
    "since the statistical error decreases with increasing number of events , @xmath244 is much smaller in the right frame ; in fact , most of the simulated experiments now fall in the `` underflow bin '' @xmath259 , which also contains all experiments giving even smaller values . in other words",
    ", most of the simulated experiments would give a reconstructed wimp mass more than five estimated standard deviations below the true value , if no @xmath67 matching is used .",
    "unfortunately the error estimates resulting from our algorithm of determining @xmath225 by minimizing @xmath184 are also not very reliable in this case . for the smaller event sample",
    ", we find that about 58% of the simulated experiments yield @xmath250 , while nearly all experiments give @xmath260 . while these numbers are not so different from the corresponding gaussian predictions , the distribution of @xmath244 is clearly highly non  gaussian in this case . just as in the scenario without @xmath67 matching the error",
    "estimates actually become less reliable with increasing event samples . if both experiments contain on average 500 events each , less than 40% of the experiments have @xmath250 , while more than 30% of the simulations yield @xmath261 .",
    "in fact , the most likely value of @xmath244 is now close to 3 . in view of these observations ,",
    "the fact that the median @xmath244 is close to zero , so that the median reconstructed wimp mass is close to the true value as already shown in fig .",
    "11 , seems almost accidental .",
    "recall also that the nominal `` @xmath251 '' uncertainty of the reconstructed wimp mass still amounts to about 40 gev in this case .",
    "this means that the most likely value of @xmath262 predicted by our algorithm exceeds the true value by more than 100 gev .",
    "this clearly leaves some room for improvements .",
    "the fact that optimal @xmath67 matching continues to give good results for both the reconstructed wimp mass and its error indicates that better data  based algorithms might very well exist .",
    "in this paper we described methods to determine the mass of a weakly interacting massive particle detected `` directly '' , i.e. , through the recoil energy deposited in a detector by the recoiling nucleus after a wimp scattered elastically off this nucleus .",
    "our methods are model  independent in the sense that they do not need any assumption about the wimp velocity distribution .",
    "the price one has to pay for this is that one will need positive signals in at least two different detectors , employing different target nuclei .",
    "our methods are based on our earlier work @xcite on reconstructing the wimp velocity distribution , which we briefly reviewed in sec .  2 .",
    "in this earlier work , which was based on results from a single ( simulated ) experiment , the wimp mass @xmath0 was an input . in sec .",
    "3 we showed how one can determine @xmath0 by equating results obtained by different experiments . here",
    "the moments of the velocity distribution function are particularly useful , since all events in the sample contribute to any given moment , leading to relatively low statistical uncertainties .",
    "we also described a method for determining @xmath0 that can be used if the ratio of wimp scattering cross sections on protons and neutrons is known ; this is true , for example , for the spin ",
    "independent scattering of supersymmetric neutralinos , where these two cross sections are nearly equal .",
    "we also showed how to combine these methods using a @xmath77 fitting procedure .",
    "4 was devoted to a detailed numerical analysis of our methods .",
    "we saw that , assuming the sizes of the event samples are fixed , the statistical errors will be smaller for larger mass difference between the two target nuclei . in practice experiments with heavier targets",
    "will accumulate more events , assuming equal exposure , at least if the spin ",
    "independent contribution to the scattering cross section dominates .",
    "however , the number of useful events ( after cuts , preferably in an almost background  free energy range ) also depends on other factors , besides the masses of the target nuclei .",
    "in our discussion we saw that , for wimp masses exceeding 100 gev or so , the maximal recoil energy @xmath67 of accepted signal events plays a crucial role .",
    "existing experiments have @xmath263 kev . if both targets used fixed @xmath67 values of this order or even smaller , a significant systematic error on the extracted wimp mass results . in principle",
    "this problem can be solved by matching the @xmath67 values of the two experiments .",
    "the problem is that perfect matching requires prior knowledge of the wimp mass .",
    "we tried two algorithms to overcome this problem .",
    "determining @xmath67 of one experiment iteratively should converge `` on average '' , but in a given experiment often leads to an endless loop , rather than a specific value of @xmath67 ; this problem is particularly severe for small event samples . on the other hand ,",
    "determining @xmath67 of the experiment with the lighter target nucleus by minimizing @xmath77 also with respect to this quantity over  estimates the wimp mass if it is small , and leads to unreliable error estimates if the wimp mass is larger , the problem becoming worse with increasing event samples . however , the fact that optimal @xmath67 matching works well in all cases , for both the median reconstructed wimp mass and its error ( which tends to be over  estimated by our expressions ) , gives us hope that a better algorithm for @xmath67 matching can be found which only relies on the data .",
    "one possibility that might be worth exploring is to employ a combination of an iterative procedure and a second @xmath77 minimization , where the latter is used only if the former does not converge to a well  defined value of the reconstructed wimp mass",
    ".    we also found that imposing a cut @xmath67 may actually be beneficial for small event samples .",
    "this is related to our earlier observation @xcite that a typical experiment will under  estimate the higher moments of @xmath12 , which receive significant contributions from recoil energies where only a fraction of an event is expected to occur in a given experiment .",
    "this problem becomes more acute for heavier target nuclei , since they have softer form factors . in particular , using xenon rather than germanium does not improve the determination of @xmath0 , since the spin ",
    "independent elastic form factor of xenon as predicted by the woods ",
    "saxon ansatz vanishes for @xmath264 kev .",
    "in contrast , the lower ( threshold ) energy of the experiment does not seem to be very important , if it can be pushed down to values near 3 kev or less .",
    "our analysis is idealized in that we ignore backgrounds , systematic uncertainties as well as the finite energy resolution .",
    "the relative error on the recoil energy in existing experiments is small compared to our most optimistic relative wimp mass error estimates even with 500 events per experiment , so ignoring it should be a good approximation .",
    "modern methods of discriminating between nuclear recoils and other events , combined with muon veto and good shielding , hold out the possibility of keeping ( some ) experiments nearly background  free also in future .    in our numerical analysis",
    "we have ignored the expected annual modulation of the wimp flux . in practice",
    "this can be done if one simply sums all events over ( at least ) one full calendar year . in principle",
    "one can also use our methods for subsets of data collected during specific times of the year .",
    "however , at least if the standard `` shifted gaussian '' velocity distribution is approximately correct , we do not expect the small annual modulation to play a significant role , even if one compares experiments taken during different parts of the year .",
    "we saw that our methods work best if the wimp mass lies in between the masses of the two target nuclei . even in that case",
    "the error will likely be significantly larger than the error on @xmath0 from collider experiments , if the wimp is part of a well  motivated extension of the standard model of particle physics , e.g. , if it is the lightest neutralino @xcite or the lightest @xmath265odd particle in `` little higgs '' models @xcite .",
    "it will nevertheless be crucial to determine the wimp mass from direct and/or indirect dark matter experiments as precisely as possible , in order to make sure that the particle produced at colliders is indeed the wimp detected by these experiments .",
    "once one is confident of this identification , one can use further collider measurements to constrain the wimp couplings .",
    "this in turn will allow to calculate the wimp  nucleus scattering cross section . together with the determination of the wimp velocity distribution @xcite , this will then yield a determination of the local wimp number density via the total counting rate in direct detection experiments .",
    "knowledge of the wimp couplings will also permit prediction of the wimp annihilation cross section .",
    "together with the dark matter density inferred from cosmological observations , this will allow to test our understanding of the early universe @xcite .",
    "a determination of the wimp mass from dark matter detection experiments is thus a crucial ingredient in many analyses that shed light on the dark sector of the universe .",
    "this work was partially supported by the marie curie training research network `` universenet '' under contract no . mrtn - ct-2006 - 035863 , as well as by the european network of theoretical astroparticle physics entapp ilias / n6 under contract no .",
    "rii3-ct-2004 - 506222 .",
    "at the end of sec .",
    "2 we gave the covariance matrix of the quantities appearing in the definition of the @xmath149 as well as @xmath179 . in eqs.([sigmom ] ) and ( [ sigsig1 ] ) we also gave expressions relating the errors on the reconstructed wimp masses to the errors on @xmath149 and @xmath179 .",
    "the only missing ingredients in the calculation of the errors on our various estimators of @xmath0 are the first derivatives of @xmath149 and @xmath179 .",
    "we begin with the former . from eq.([eqn3201 ] ) , it can be found directly that = +   , = , + and = - . by first",
    "exchanging @xmath266 and @xmath267 with @xmath268 and @xmath269 , respectively , and then replacing @xmath86 by @xmath87 , one finds = - +   , = - , + and = .",
    "note that a factor @xmath149 appears in all these expressions ; this allows to cast the final result for the error on @xmath0 estimated using moments of @xmath12 into a form analogous to that in eq.([eqn3105 ] ) even in the presence of non  trivial cuts on the recoil energy , with the same prefactor .",
    "moreover , all the @xmath270 should be understood to be computed according to eq.([in ] ) or its discretization ( [ eqn2210 ] ) with integration limits @xmath63 and @xmath67 specific for that target .",
    "similarly , the derivatives of @xmath179 can be computed from eq.([rsigma1 ] ) : [ rsigmadifa ] = _ , and [ rsigmadifb ] = _ , @xmath271 the derivatives with respect to the @xmath87 variables can be obtained from eqs.([rsigmadifa ] ) and ( [ rsigmadifb ] ) by simply changing @xmath272 everywhere and changing the overall plus signs to minus signs .",
