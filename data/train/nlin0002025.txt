    "further we have also found that when _ any _ two of the thirty parameters in the system  ( [ quad ] ) are unknown , we can apply our method to simultaneously estimate them asymptotically _ to any desired accuracy _ when the time series of a suitably chosen variables is given .",
    "our results suggest that the information about all the thirty parameters should in principle be contained in the time series of a single variable of the system , though at present we do not have any systematic approach to the simultaneous estimation of all of them .",
    "in this section we discuss an algorithm for repetitive use of our method to impove the accuracy of parameter estimation when the given time series is of finite duration .    before going on to describe the algorithm",
    "it should be mentioned here that even if a finite time series is used repeatedly , we do not expect an exact estimation of the unknown parameter .",
    "a finite chaotic trajectory sets a limit on the accuracy to which the unknown parameter can be estimated .",
    "this can be seen as follows :    we consider symbolic dynamics on the attractor which provides a generating partion of the attractor .",
    "it is well known that as the system evolves in time , a finer and finer coarse graining is required to specify a particular trajectory or alternatively , the trajectory gives us a finer coarse grained information about the attractor . the number of coarse grained partitions as a function of time goes as , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the kolmogorov entropy  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath79 is the volume of a hypercube in a @xmath80 dimensional phase space and if the size of the attractor is normailized to unity , the number of hypercubes in a generating partion may be approximated as , @xmath81 equations ( [ np1 ] ) and ( [ np2 ] ) indicate that the length scale of a hypercube in a generating partition goes as , @xmath82 it can be seen from eq .  ( [ xi ] )",
    "that as long as @xmath63 is finite , the volume of the hypercube in a coarse graining of the attractor will not reduce to zero .",
    "thus a finite trajectory sets a limit on the accuracy to which any information can be extracted from it .",
    "this can be further related to lyapunov exponents using the famous kaplan - yorke conjecture  @xcite as , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the characteristic lyapunov exponent of the system . for a chaotic system with a single positive lyapunov exponent denoted by @xmath85 , eqn .",
    "( [ ky ] ) reduces to , @xmath86    now we will discuss the algorithm for repetitive use of a finite time series to estimate an unknown parameter .",
    "similar to the case considered in section iia , we assume that the parameters @xmath87 in eq.([trans ] ) are unknown while the time series of @xmath6 is given .",
    "we further assume that the time series is truncated after a finite time @xmath88 .    for the time interval @xmath89",

    "( [ recev ] ) and  ( [ adapt ] ) ) to evolve variables @xmath90 with random initial conditions .",
    "the given finite time series is fed in system ( [ recev ] ) as in the earlier case . in this way we can get an approximate value of @xmath7 which we denote as , @xmath91 .    now at time @xmath92 we set the variables @xmath8 to exactly the same ( randomly chosen earlier ) initial values while @xmath93 and feed the same finite time series @xmath94 again into the system ( [ recev ] ) through the feedback terms in eqs .",
    "( [ recev ] ) and  ( [ adapt ] ) , i.e. we set @xmath95 .",
    "we now evolve the variables @xmath96 for the time interval @xmath97 to obtain a new estimated value of @xmath7 which is @xmath98 .",
    "we repeat the procedure to get successive estimates for the value of @xmath7 denoted by @xmath99 at times @xmath100 respectively . thus , starting from an initial guess for the value of @xmath7 we obtain a sequence of estimates @xmath101 after @xmath102 usages of the given finite time series . for large enough @xmath102",
    "we get a better and better estimate of @xmath7 , although eventually the accuracy of such an estimate saturates as @xmath102 is increased further .",
    "the conditions for the method of parameter estimation using a finite time series to work successfully are  :    1 .",
    "the conditional lyapunov exponents associated with the reconstructed system should be all negative .",
    "the time @xmath88 after which the given time series is truncated should satisfy @xmath103 where @xmath104 denotes the transient time required for synchronization of the systems ( [ trans ] ) and ( [ recev ] ) with the parameter evolution given by eq .",
    "( [ adapt ] ) .    in the next subsection ,",
    "we discuss two examples of parameter estimation from a finite time series , viz .",
    "lorenz system and an electrical circuit of a phase converter .",
    "as our first example we choose the lorenz system given by eq .",
    "( [ lortf ] ) where we assume that the time series @xmath105 is given and the value of @xmath58 is to be estimated .",
    "we set up the following system of equations ( see eqs .",
    "( [ recev ] ) and  ( [ adapt ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath106 where we feed the given time series in the evolution of @xmath50 for the interval @xmath107 to obtain the first estimate @xmath108 .",
    "as described in the earlier subsection , we then go on repetitively feeding the same finite time series @xmath109 in eq.([lorr ] ) to obtain successive estimates for the value of @xmath58 .",
    "starting from a random initial value we denote this sequence of estimates by @xmath110 where n denotes the number of times we use the given time series .",
    "in fig.3 we plot the evolution of the difference @xmath111 as a function of time @xmath63 during the time interval @xmath112 where we use the time series @xmath109 thrice .",
    "we see that the difference decreases as we increase the number of times the finite time series is used .",
    "we also observe that shortly after each resetting of the initial vector @xmath113 which is done at times @xmath114 , the synchronization weakens and fluctuations are present .",
    "this is due to the random resetting of the @xmath115 and @xmath116 components which gives a transient before the synchronization is recovered .",
    "an appropriate feedback constant @xmath13 may be chosen to lessen this transient in every usage of the time series .",
    "in fig.4 we plot the successive differences @xmath117 as a function of @xmath102 , the number of times we use the given finite time series .",
    "we see that the difference @xmath117 goes on decreasing with increasing @xmath102 .",
    "however , as @xmath102 is increased further , it saturates to a constant finite value depending on the length of the time series used for the calculations .",
    "this is consistent with our expectations that finite time series can contain only finite information about the system as discussed in the previous subsection , e.g. using @xmath118 , the finest length scale that can be obtained using a finite time series with @xmath119 is estimated to be @xmath120 ( eq .  ( [ ky+ ] ) ) which means an accuracy of about @xmath121 .",
    "this is also the order of magnitude of the accuracy of parameter estimation .",
    "the three curves in fig .",
    "4 correspond to three different values of @xmath122 .",
    "we see that an increasing @xmath88 gives better estimate of the parameter .",
    "this is natural since a very long time series corresponding to @xmath123 is expected to give an exact estimation of the unknown parameter .",
    "we have similarly implemented our method to estimate other parameters of lorenz system using finite time series of either @xmath50 or @xmath115 .",
    "the method fails to estimate any of the parameters when the time series of @xmath124 is given .",
    "the reason for this is that one of the associated conditional lyapunov exponents is critically zero and the convergences are slow .      as our next example",
    ", we consider the set of equations describing an electrical circuit for a phase converter  @xcite system in a dimensionless form given by , @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the two parameters .",
    "here we consider the time series @xmath128 to be given .",
    "notice that the system  ( [ ckt ] ) has a simple time dependent term making it a non - autonomous system .",
    "such a system is equivalent to an autonomous system in higher dimensions .",
    "we have successfully estimated any one of the parameters @xmath126 or @xmath127 ( or both ) using finite time series of @xmath129 .",
    "figure 5(a ) shows a schematic diagram of the circuit for the phase converter .",
    "the system in known to exhibit a chaotic behaviour due to period doubling bifurcations , codimension two bifurcations etc .",
    "figure 5 ( b ) shows a chaotic attractor in the @xmath130 plane of the phase space .",
    "figure 6 shows the plot of the successive differences @xmath131 as a function of @xmath102 , the number of times we use the given time series for two different values of the truncation time t. as expected the accuracy of the estimation increases with increasing @xmath88 while showing a saturation with increasing number of repeated usages .",
    "thus , we have shown how the method of parameter estimation can be used when a finite time series is given .",
    "the method works when the cle s associated are all negative and the time series given is of longer duration than the transient time required for synchronization .",
    "here we describe an interesting application of our method to test a function modeling an unknown external source of perturbation to a known chaotic system . in many practical situations when",
    "an external source of disturbance in not known , a trial function is used to model the perturbation .",
    "we imagine a situation when it is required to verify a proposed trial model form for the perturbation .",
    "we denote the actual perturbation by a function @xmath132 and the trial function by @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are parameters . in the following ,",
    "we demonstrate the use of our method of parameter estimation to confirm the form of the trial function .",
    "note that here we do not deal with the issue of obtaining the form of the model function .",
    "now if the proposed trial function @xmath136 models the external perturbation @xmath137 correctly , then a scheme based on synchronization combined with adaptive control should produce synchronization of variables and make the parameters @xmath135 converge ( to @xmath134 ) .",
    "thus a successful synchronization should then indicate a correctly chosen model function . in this manner",
    "we can use the method to distinguish between a correct model and a wrong model for an external perturbation .",
    "we elaborate on this application further using the example of lorenz system .",
    "consider the lorenz system perturbed by a sinusoidal term @xmath138 , @xmath139 where we assume the unperturbed lorenz system to be known .",
    "the function @xmath140 is the external perturbation .",
    "we assume that the time series of @xmath50 is given as an output of the system  ( [ lorex ] ) .    to set up the required scheme",
    "we construct a system of variables @xmath113 and their evolution as , @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the trial perturbation function .",
    "we feed the time series @xmath109 obtained from system  ( [ lorex ] ) into the model system  ( [ model ] ) . now",
    "if @xmath136 models the behaviour of @xmath137 correctly then the two systems should exhibit synchronization while the parameters should show convergence to the correct values . in our simulations",
    "we have tried several different forms for the trial function @xmath136 .",
    "figures 7(a)-(c ) show the time evolution of @xmath143 and @xmath144 respectively while the feedback is given into @xmath50 and the trial function is @xmath145 .",
    "it can be clearly seen that there is no synchronization of variables .",
    "the trial function @xmath146 thus fails to produce synchronization and hence can be discarded as a plausible model for @xmath137 .",
    "we also note that the parameters @xmath147 and @xmath148 do not show convergence .    in figs . 8 and 9",
    ", we plot similar graphs for two more choices of the trial function . in fig .",
    "8(a)-(c ) we use @xmath149 and plot @xmath150 and @xmath144 respectively .",
    "we choose this form of @xmath136 since it represents the two leading terms in the series expansion of the the function @xmath151 .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "8 that such an approximation fails to produce synchronization and also the convergence of parameters .    as a third choice we use @xmath152 in eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) and plot the time evolution of @xmath143 and @xmath144 in fig.9(a)-(c ) respectively .",
    "the difference @xmath153 goes to zero as time increases showing synchronization .",
    "the parameters @xmath154 and @xmath144 converge to the correct values @xmath155 and @xmath156 respectively .",
    "the variables @xmath157 and @xmath158 also synchronize with @xmath115 and @xmath124 respectively .",
    "this confirms that this trial function correctly models the function @xmath137 .",
    "now as a last consideration , we use the form @xmath152 again but unlike in eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) we perturb a wrong variable in the model system , i.e. we choose to add the trial perturbation in the evolution of say @xmath157 . the feedback is given in @xmath50 .",
    "the evolution equations are @xmath159    in fig.10  ( a)-(c ) we plot the time evolution of @xmath143 and @xmath144 respectively .",
    "we see that even if @xmath136 correctly models @xmath137 , synchronization does not take place .",
    "this shows that along with the form of @xmath137 we can also confirm a guess about the perturbed variable .",
    "thus , the results presented in this section suggest that the method which we use for estimating parameters can be used to distinguish between a correct trial function and the wrong trial functions for an unknown external perturbation to a known system  @xcite .",
    "we have described dynamic method of parameter estimation from a given chaotic time series of a phase space variable of a dynamical system  @xcite .",
    "further , we have generalized the method for the case when the quantity for which the time series is given is a _ scalar function _ of the phase space variables .",
    "we have shown that it is not only possible to synchronize two systems using the time series of the scalar function but also to asymptotically estimate unknown parameters adaptively to any desired accuracy .",
    "this is done by providing a linear feedback in the evolution of one of the variables on which the scalar function explicitly depends .",
    "the method works successfully provided the function for which the time series is given is such that the associated conditional lyapunov exponents are all negative .",
    "we have also applied our method to a system with a large number of parameters , i.e. a general quadratic flow in 3-d . we have observed that a simultaneous estimation of a few parameters is possible provided the condition of convergence as stated in ref .",
    "@xcite is satisfied i.e. all the cle s are negative .    as a next consideration ,",
    "we have extended our method to a realistic situation when the given series is truncated after a finite time .",
    "we have shown that repetitive use of a finite time series can be made to estimate an unknown parameter of the system .",
    "the accuracy of the parameter estimation saturates as the given finite time series is used more and more number of times",
    ". the accuracy increases with the increasing length of the given time series .    in the end",
    "we have demonstrated an important application of our method in confirming the correctness of a trial model function for an unknown external perturbation to a known system .",
    "we see that a perfect synchronization between a perturbed system and its dynamical copy using a model for the perturbation is possible only when the form of the trial function is correctly guessed .",
    "these results indicate that our method can be used as a test for the trial model for an unknown external perturbation to a known system .",
    "another possible application ( not discussed in the paper ) is as follows .",
    "our method may be employed to experimentally measure the unknown value of a component added to a known circuit .",
    "in such a situation the equations governing the circuit are known , and can be used to estimate the unknown component value accurately .",
    "this is feasible due to the asymptotic convergences in our method .",
    "we note that the application of parameter estimation that we have discussed here is fairly general and may not depend on a particular method used to estimate the parameters .",
    "use of alternative methods for parameter estimation , such as those discussed in the introduction may be possible ."
