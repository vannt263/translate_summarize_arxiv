    "however , in low energy and hadronic scales , it is difficult to get reliable theoretical estimate for the mass using the perturbative qcd . therefore , we need some non - perturative methods to describe the non - perturative phenomena .",

    "the qcd sum rule attempts to link the hadron phenomenology with the interactions of quarks and gluons , which contains three main ingredients : an approximate description of the correlator in terms of intermediate states through the dispersion relation , a description of the same correlator in terms of qcd degrees of freedom via an ope , and a procedure for matching these two descriptions and extracting the parameters that characterize the hadronic state of interest .",

    "the coupling of the current with the state can be defined by the decay constant as follows : @xmath31 in phenomenology , @xmath32 can be expressed as a dispersion integral over a physical spectral function @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the mass of the hadronic resonance . in the ope side ,",
