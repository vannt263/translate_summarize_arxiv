    "the interface exhibits self - affine properties , and earlier work mostly dealt with dynamic scaling behavior of integral measures such as the interface roughness @xcite .",
    "recently , the focus of research on the kpz equation shifted toward studies of the complete one - point probability distribution of the interface height at a finite time .",
    "several groups have achieved remarkable progress in finding exact representations for this probability distribution in @xmath0 dimensions for several classes of initial conditions , see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews .    in ( much simpler ) linear models , the finite - time one - point height distribution in @xmath0 dimension",

    "when encountering divergences like this , one usually resorts to microscopic cutoffs for regularization @xcite . a small price to pay for such a regularization is a partial loss of universality , as the variance now explicitly depends on the microscopic cutoff which is different for different models belonging to the same universality class .",
