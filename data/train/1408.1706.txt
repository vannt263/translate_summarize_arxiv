    "the larger sample of all sne  ia is reduced to a group of so - called `` normal '' sne  ia , a group that follow a regular variation of their properties with the width of the peak of their optical light curves ( i.e. , scaling ) .",

    "the reduced sample comprises roughly half of the sne  ia discovered , and will be the focus of this work .    a key element of the cosmological utilization of sne  ia is the assumption that the sn  ia phenomenon does not change as the universe has aged , or that any changes continue to follow the empirical laws derived for nearby normal sne  ia .",
    "for example , the method can work if higher-@xmath1 sne  ia tend to have broader optical light curves , as long as the luminosities of those sne still follow the wlr for that peak width .",
    "the problem would arise if higher-@xmath1 sne  ia had brighter or fainter luminosities for the same light - curve shape .",
    "an example of one such problem was reported by sullivan et al .",

    "all simulations suggest that the uv emission is much more strongly affected by metallicity variations than the optical emission , and would lead to variations in the uv - optical colors of sne  ia with different progenitor metallicities .",

    "one alternative explanation to nuv - blue sne  ia being the dominant explosion variety at higher redshifts is that the nuv - blue events are more luminous and are over - represented in a magnitude limited sample .",
    "there are a number of factors that argue against that explanation .",
    "first , none of the samples were rest - frame @xmath9-band dominated when determining candidates , so a luminosity bias would only occur if nuv - blue sne were optically bright .",
    "the fact that this separation was not recognized years ago argues against a difference of more than 0.1 - 0.2  mag .",
    "further , e08 and f12 studied magnitude selection effects and determined that their samples were not strongly biased .",
    "second , all three mid-@xmath1 surveys showed the same nuv - blue dominance , despite the differences between the sample selection for each survey .",
    "third , even if there were a luminosity bias of  0.3  mag , the effect would be much too small to shift the nuv - blue : red ratio from 40% to 90% .",
    "we conclude that there is a real variation in the nuv - blue to nuv - red ratio with redshift .",
    "using the same approach as employed for the low-@xmath1 _ hst _ sn spectra in m13 , we compare spectra of nuv - red / blue pairs . for two sne to be considered `` pairs , '' we require that they have similar optical light - curve shapes ( in the same third of the sample ) , have similar phases ( within 1 day excepting one pair ) , and have _ different _ uv colors . selecting the best matches that meet these requirements allow a direct comparison of sn spectra which largely removes possible differences attributable to light - curve shape ( and thus luminosity ) and phase ; therefore , any differences in the spectra are more likely to be related to the differences in uv colors .",
    "we present these spectra pairs in figure  [ compspec_mixed ] .",
    "as expected , the spectra of sne from the nuv - blue group have a higher uv flux than those of sne from the nuv - red group .",
    "interestingly , there is no noticeable difference in the optical continua ( @xmath23   ) of sne from the two groups .",
    "this is perhaps not unexpected given the similar optical    colors for all sne .",
    "but it indicates that this effect is not caused by odd reddening , which would have some subtle difference in the optical continuum , or the confluence of a strong continuum difference offset by differences in spectral features .",
    "also notable is that the same uv spectral features are present for both groups .",
    "although the strengths of these lines are different for each sn , it is clear that the uv color difference is the result of a difference in a wide band in the uv wavelength range and not the presence / absence of particular lines or dramatically different line strengths ( and unaffected uv continua ) in one particular group .",
    "the final clear difference in the two groups is the velocity of multiple spectral features .",
    "when the @xmath24 feature is observed with a reasonable signal - to - noise ratio , the nuv - red sn often has a broader , higher - velocity line than the nuv - blue paired sn ( and the nuv - blue spectrum never has a higher - velocity feature for our pairs ) .",
    "this is sometimes easier to see in the residual spectra , which shows a positive bump at @xmath25 6100   , indicating excess absorption in the nuv - red spectra .",
    "this is perhaps best seen in the comparison of sne  2006pq and 2007ml .",
    "since the sne have similar light - curve shapes and the spectra are at similar phases , we conclude that the velocity of the @xmath24 feature is linked to the uv colors .",
    "we note that the trend with velocity is not exclusive to ; in particular , h&k shows similar behavior .",
    "foley & kasen ( 2011 ) first showed that the intrinsic @xmath26 color of a sn  ia was strongly linked to the velocity of the @xmath24 feature near maximum light .",
    "the physical explanation for this effect is that higher - velocity spectral features are also broader , creating additional opacity in the blue where line blanketing dominates , while further to the red , electron scattering dominates the opacity , and thus the broader lines do not increase the overall opacity for those wavelengths .",
    "this interpretation predicts that other than the obvious velocity differences , spectral differences between low and high - velocity sne should be largely constrained to the bluer wavelengths , that the differences should largely be a difference in the continuum , and that the difference should persist to the uv .",
    "figure  [ compspec_mixed ] supports this interpretation , and the differences in uv colors may predominantly be caused by different opacities resulting from different ejecta velocities . with a larger uvot sample , an interesting comparison will be between low velocity ( lv ) nuv - blue sne and lv nuv - red sne .",
    "if the velocity distributions are similar between those groups , the prediction would be that the @xmath2 colors would be similar .",

    "we then use the fractions of nuv - blue and nuv - red sne as determined in section  2 to determine the evolution of the hubble residual bias as a function of redshift .",
    "the first simulation assumes @xmath55 or @xmath56 , the differences seen for the low-@xmath1 and mid-@xmath1 samples , respectively .",
    "we also assume that @xmath57 or @xmath58 , resulting in four distinct possibilities for the hubble residual bias . since there is no specific preference for one possibility over the others , we perform a monte carlo simulation drawing from each of the four possibilities to determine the median bias and the uncertainty on the bias .",
    "the second simulation is similar to the first , but uses @xmath59 .",
    "this is the measured @xmath60 offset between the low and high - velocity subsamples of the foley & kasen ( 2011 ) sample .",
    "as shown above , ejecta velocity is highly correlated with nuv color .",

    "both predict the hubble residual bias to change with redshift with the bias being negative at low @xmath1 and positive at high @xmath1 .",
    "this is expected since nuv - red sne , which should have their extinction overestimated and their distance moduli underestimated , are more prevalent in the local universe .",
    "the magnitude of the bias depends on the magnitude of the @xmath2 difference .",

    "we use the _ simple - cosfitter _ ( v1.6.11 ) package to estimate the cosmological parameters , @xmath87 and @xmath69 for each combined sample , and compare the results to the cosmological parameters estimated from the full unbiased nuv - red sample .",

    "there are many sources of systematics or potential new physics that could cause the observed tension between the sne  ia data and the results from cmb experiments , and we can not definitely ascribe it to the effect of two groups of uv - optical colors in sne  ia . as the size of the _ swift _ sne  ia sample increases , and high-@xmath1 searches such as pan - starrs and des probe the rest - frame uv with better s / n , it will become possible to identify and characterize different color groups more thoroughly .",

    "efforts are also being made to observe sne ia in the nearby hubble flow with uvot to reduce the effect of peculiar and/or thermal velocities on the redshift - derived distances .",
    "for the more nearby sne , improved distances using cepheids or other distance indicators would allow the differences seen in the uv photometry as well as spectroscopy @xcite to be compared directly to the absolute magnitudes in the optical .",

    "the colors within each group match the low-@xmath1 colors , but the bluer , nuv - blue group dominates at high-@xmath1 ( 90% ) , the opposite of what is seen at low-@xmath1 ( @xmath2533% ) .",
    "this change appears to be the explanation for the difference between high-@xmath1 mean spectra and low-@xmath1 mean spectra that were generated from these samples .",

    "this presents problems for methods of extinction estimation for sne  ia that utilize @xmath47 colors , as existing methods do not differentiate nuv - red / blue events . the use of sne  ia as cosmological distance indicators rely upon distant sne  ia being similar to nearby sne  ia , at least to the extent that there are nearby reference sne  ia for all distant sne  ia .",
    "the finding that nuv - blue events dominate distant sne  ia means that the absolute magnitudes , and a separate luminosity - width relation needs to be derived for this group of normal sne  ia .",
    "we found that the nuv color differences were highly correlated with the measured ejecta velocity .",
    "optical color differences have also been reported between normal sne  ia that have been divided into two groups based upon the blueshift of a prominent @xmath176355 absorption feature ( @xcite , f12 ) .",
    "foley & kasen ( 2011 ) suggested that the physical reason for the correlation between color and ejecta velocity was driven by the connection between the depth of the line - forming region within the ejecta and the opacity .",
    "one can interpret this connection as higher ejecta velocities causing overlapping lines and thus increased opacity and redder @xmath47 colors or as increased fe - group abundance increasing the opacity and causing the line - forming region for intermediate - mass elements to be further out in the ejecta and thus at higher velocity .",
    "m13 showed that nuv - blue sne  ia have low velocities while the nuv - red sne  ia are equally mixed between low and high - velocity objects .",
    "approximately two - thirds of low-@xmath1 sne  ia have low - velocity ejecta ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ) . meanwhile , about one - third of low-@xmath1 sne  ia are nuv - blue .",
    "low-@xmath1 sne  ia can be separated into two roughly equal - sized groups : low - velocity / nuv - blue , low - velocity / nuv - red , and high - velocity / nuv - red .",
    "the low - velocity / nuv - blue events are bluer in @xmath47 , leading to the observed color differences .",
    "this contrasts with the mid-@xmath1 sample , where about three - quarters of the sample are nuv - blue . for the subsample where we could determine their ejecta velocities , the mid-@xmath1 nuv - blue sne were essentially all low - velocity , while half of the mid-@xmath1 nuv - red sne are high - velocity",
    "therefore , the three groups listed above , low - velocity / nuv - blue , low - velocity / nuv - red , and high - velocity / nuv - red , have approximate fractions of 76% , 12% , and 12% , respectively .",
    "we note that these fractions are seen for a subsample of mid-@xmath1 sne  ia , specifically those with relatively high - quality spectra .",
    "as detailed by e08 and f12 it is unlikely that these subsamples had selection effects that cause this color difference .",
    "however , it is possible that the true fractions for the entire sn  ia population at higher redshifts could vary from those reported here .",
    "these findings motivate revisiting the sn templates that are used in comparisons with high - redshift sne  ia .",
    "two sets of templates should be produced , one for nuv - blue sne  ia and one for nuv - red sne  ia .",
    "a key for inclusion into the new template sets will be whether nuv - red / blue membership can be determined .",
    "for archival sn  ia observations , that would require that at least some observations of a given sn were performed with a detector with acceptable blue sensitivity , to allow clear separation between nuv - red and nuv - blue . for future sn  ia observations , these findings suggest placing a high priority on detectors with excellent blue sensitivity , or building a template set from uvot - observed sne  ia .",
    "an alternative possibility would be for the observations of known nuv - red and nuv - blue sne to reveal another observable characteristic that completely correlates with the nuv - optical along those same lines , it will be important to understand the associations between nuv - red / blue groupings and other characteristics that are independent of peak width , such as : hv / lv grouping , the presence or absence of unburned carbon in early - epoch spectra , whether the late @xmath39 and @xmath93 band photometry follows the lira relation and whether the optical spectra show evidence of strong na d absorption lines .",
    "collectively , correlations between these groupings will be a powerful probe of the progenitor metallicity , the binary pair , and the explosion physics of the different varieties of sne  ia .",

    "<S> uv and optical photometry of type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) at low redshift have revealed the existence of two distinct color groups , nuv - red and nuv - blue events . </S>",
    "<S> the color curves differ primarily by an offset , with the nuv - blue @xmath0 color curves bluer than the nuv - red curves by 0.4 mag . for a sample of 23 low-@xmath1 sne  ia observed with _ </S>",
    "<S> swift _ , the nuv - red group dominates by a ratio of 2:1 . </S>",
    "<S> we compare rest - frame uv / optical spectrophotometry of intermediate and high-@xmath1 sne  ia with uvot photometry and _ hst _ spectrophotometry of low-@xmath1 sne  ia , finding that the same two color groups exist at higher-@xmath1 , but with the nuv - blue events as the dominant group . within each red / blue group </S>",
    "<S> , we do not detect any offset in color for different redshifts , providing insight into how sn  ia uv emission evolves with redshift . through spectral comparisons of sne  ia with similar peak widths and phase , we explore the wavelength range that produces the uv / opt color differences . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the ejecta velocity of nuv - red sne is larger than that of nuv - blue objects by roughly 12% on average . </S>",
    "<S> this velocity difference can explain some of the uv / optical color difference , but differences in the strengths of spectral features seen in mean spectra require additional explanation . </S>",
    "<S> because of the different @xmath2 colors for these groups , nuv - red sne will have their extinction underestimated using common techniques . </S>",
    "<S> this , in turn , leads to under - estimation of the optical luminosity of the nuv - blue sne  ia , in particular , for the high - redshift cosmological sample . </S>",
    "<S> not accounting for this effect should thus produce a distance bias that increases with redshift and could significantly bias measurements of cosmological parameters . </S>"
