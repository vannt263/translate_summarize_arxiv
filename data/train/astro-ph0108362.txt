    "nasa s microwave anisotropy probe ( map ) satellite ( wright 1999 ) has begun its mission aimed at all - sky imaging of the last scattering surface of cmb photons , at several frequencies and with high angular resolution . in 2007 ,",
    "the very early phase of our universe will be probed with even higher sensitivity and angular resolution by esa s planck satellite ( mandolesi et al .",
    "1998 ; puget et al . 1998 ) . in the meantime",
    ", new ground - based and balloon - borne experiments will provide improved maps of regions of the sky ( see de bernardis et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) .",
    "the main goal of these projects is to extract a map as accurate as possible of cmb anisotropies at all scales relevant for cosmology .",
    "this will allow us to determine the fundamental cosmological parameters with very high accuracy and to accurately test the models of structure formation .",
    "maps produced by these missions will contain not only the cmb signal but also contributions from different components placed between us and the last scattering surface . these consist of galactic free - free , thermal and spinning dust , and synchrotron emissions , of compact galactic and extragalactic sources as well as of the thermal and kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich effect in cluster of galaxies .",
    "therefore , in order to exploit the wealth of cosmological and astrophysical information encoded in these maps , it is necessary to separate the different components with high accuracy and reliability .",
    "a great deal of work in this direction has been carried out by several authors ( de oliveira - costa & tegmark  1999 , tenorio et al .  1999 ,",
    "hobson et al .  1998 , 1999 , stolyarov et al .",
    "2001 , prunet et al .",
    "2001 and baccigalupi et al .",
    "2000 ) exploring different reconstruction techniques , from wiener filtering and maximum entropy method ( mem ) , both in real and fourier space , to wavelets and neural networks .",
    "traditional methods ( wiener filtering and mem ) have been successfully applied to all - sky maps .",
    "they need the prior knowledge of the frequency dependence of the astrophysical components to be recovered , as well as of the power spectra of their spatial pattern .",
    "recently stolyarov et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have achieved a high quality reconstruction of the various components using a mem algorithm working in harmonic space , assuming prior knowledge of the frequency dependence and of the azimuthally - averaged power spectrum of each input component except for the cmb .",
    "computational requirements are quite demanding : the reconstruction requires 6 hours using 30 r10000 processors on an sgi origin 2000 supercomputer and 14 gb of ram .    the independent component analysis ( ica ) , based on a feed - forward neural network ( baccigalupi et al .",
    "2000 ) , works remarkably well without any a - priori knowledge on the components , provided that they are statistically independent and have all , but at most one , non - gaussian distributions , as is actually the case since , at most , the distribution of cmb fluctuations is gaussian , while foregrounds are all highly non - gaussian .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is that the algorithm is able to learn how to reconstruct independent components and their frequency scalings from the input maps .",
    "this technique is very interesting for at least three reasons .",
    "first , as we show in this work , it is able to recover independent components and their frequency dependencies with high accuracy also in the presence of instrumental noise .",
    "second , it can be used as prior estimator for non - blind separation algorithms .",
    "third , a blind approach is necessary whenever reliable priors for the foreground emissions are not available , as in the case of cmb polarization .",
    "baccigalupi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have applied this technique to small sky patches of @xmath5 , without instrumental noise . in these ideal conditions ,",
    "cmb is reconstructed with @xmath6 accuracy , weaker galactic components are recovered with @xmath7 error , while point sources are extracted down to a flux corresponding to @xmath8 .",
    "we present here the application of a new ica method ( ) , proposed by hyvrinen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , to the problem of separating the various astrophysical components present in all - sky maps .",
    "this technique proved to be extremely fast : on a pentium iii 600 mhz pc , it took only @xmath9 minutes to perform the component separation over the whole sky with @xmath10 resolution .",
    "furthermore , and importantly , this technique allows us to deal also with the instrumental noise , at least as long as it can be approximated by a gaussian distribution and is uniformly distributed over the sky .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ formalization ]",
    "we formalize the problem of component separation and list the assumptions we have made .",
    "section  [ fastica ] describes in detail the technique used in this work . in section  [ model ]",
    "we study the quality of signal reconstruction with for different kinds of toy models i.e. when the input signals are well known and controlled .",
    "section  [ planck ] deals with more realistic simulations of sky maps , focusing on the planck satellite frequency channels and instrumental characteristics ( noise and fwhm ) .",
    "finally , a discussion and conclusions are presented in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "let us consider the sky radiation as a function of direction @xmath11 and frequency @xmath12 , and assume that it results from the superposition of signals coming from @xmath13 different physical processes .",
    "@xmath14    where @xmath15 is the total radiation from direction @xmath11 at frequency @xmath12 , and @xmath16 are the individual physical processes that form the total radiation .",
    "the signal @xmath15 is observed through a telescope , whose beam pattern can be modelled , at each frequency , as a shift - invariant point spread function @xmath17 . for each value of @xmath12",
    ", the telescope de - focuses the physical radiation map by convolving it with the kernel @xmath18 .",
    "the frequency - dependent convolved signal is input to an @xmath19-channel measuring instrument , which integrates the signal over frequency on each of its channels and adds some noise to its output .",
    "the final signal at the output of the measurement channel at frequency @xmath12 is given by    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the frequency response of the channel , and @xmath22 is the related noise map . to simplify the data model in eq .",
    "( [ ichannel ] ) , let us now make the following assumptions :    _ assumption 1 _    each source signal is a separable function of location and frequency :    @xmath23    _ assumption 2 _    @xmath17 is frequency - independent over each channel pass - band i.e. for each frequency where @xmath24 in the @xmath25-th channel , the corresponding beam function @xmath26 is the same .",
    "these two assumptions lead us to a new data model : @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes convolution , and @xmath29 this data model can be further simplified by making another assumption :    _ assumption 3 _    the radiation pattern of the telescope is the same for all the measurement channels , that is , the function @xmath17 is frequency independent : @xmath30 in this case , eq .",
    "( [ ich_appr ] ) can be rewritten in vector form as : @xmath31 where each component , @xmath32 , of the vector @xmath33 is given by the corresponding source function @xmath34 , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ ass1 ] ) , convolved with the frequency - independent radiation pattern @xmath18 . the matrix @xmath35 is the mixing matrix whose elements are the @xmath36 defined by eq .",
    "( [ aij ] ) .",
    "we detailed this derivation to stress all the simplifying assumptions made .",
    "depending on the particular astrophysical application , one or more of these assumptions might be not justified .",
    "each of these cases needs to be addressed by a specific strategy . in the present simple case",
    ", we are just assuming that the noise is additive , signal - independent , white , gaussian , and stationary .",
    "for example , it can be noted that , in principle , assumption 3 is somewhat bad for applications where the instrument has different @xmath37 at different frequencies , since it requires that higher resolution channels are degraded to the worst one .    equation ( [ datavector2 ] ) establishes a point - wise linear data model for our problem , that is , it holds true independently for each direction @xmath11 or , likewise , for each pixel in the vector data map @xmath38 . at this point ,",
    "our problem can be formulated as follows : with reference to the data model [ eq .",
    "( [ datavector2 ] ) ] , for each pixel @xmath39 identified by a unit vector @xmath11 , estimate both the @xmath13-dimensional source vector @xmath33 and the @xmath40 mixing matrix @xmath41 from the @xmath19-dimensional data vector @xmath38 .",
    "the problem of estimating both @xmath35 and @xmath33 from @xmath38 via eq .",
    "( [ datavector2 ] ) is unsolvable in the absence of additional information .",
    "the ica approach assumes that    * the components of vector @xmath33 are independent random processes on the map domains ; * the components of vector @xmath33 , save at most one , have non - gaussian distributions .    in this section ,",
    "we summarize an efficient strategy , described in detail in hyvrinen & oja ( 1997 ) and hyvrinen ( 1999 ) , to separate the independent components @xmath33 , exploiting these assumptions .    it has been proved ( comon 1994 ; cardoso 1998 ) that if the components of @xmath33 [ eq .",
    "( [ datavector2 ] ) ] are independent , a solution to our problem can be obtained by searching a transformation @xmath42 for the data vector @xmath38 such that the transformed vector @xmath43 has independent components .",
    "we should thus find a measure of independence among the components of @xmath44 and maximize it for @xmath42 .",
    "intuitively , an equivalent approach to achieve independence is to maximize non - gaussianity .",
    "indeed , due to the central limit theorem , a variable resulting from a mixture of independent variables is `` more gaussian '' than the original variables themselves .",
    "this means that finding a transformation such that the gaussianity of the variables is reduced is equivalent to find a set of transformed variables that are `` more independent '' than the original ones .",
    "a strategy to find maximally non - gaussian transformed variables is to select a suitable measure of non - gaussianity and then maximize it for the transform operator @xmath42 .",
    "this approach can be shown to be equivalent to other theoretically sound approaches proposed in the literature ( comon 1994 ; amari & chichocki 1998 ; cardoso 1998 ) . since eq .",
    "( [ datavector2 ] ) is a noisy model , it is necessary to find a measure of non - gaussianity , via a suitable defined neg - entropy , that allows us to adopt computing strategies that are robust against noise .",
    "an approximation to the neg - entropy function has been proposed by hyvrinen & oja ( 2000 ) and hyvrinen ( 1999 ) as a measure of non - gaussianity for the transformed variables and , if the noise has the features assumed in the previous section and its covariance matrix is known , the gaussian moments of @xmath44 are shown to be robust estimates of the desired function .",
    "it is possible to maximize non - gaussianity by means of a newton algorithm , after some preprocessing of the data .",
    "the rows of the transformation matrix @xmath42 can be estimated one by one , and a noise - robust estimate is achievable .",
    "this does not mean that by linearly transforming @xmath38 through @xmath42 we obtain a robust estimate of @xmath33 , especially in very noisy cases . to see this , with no loss of generality",
    ", we can assume @xmath45 , and @xmath42 as a robust estimate of @xmath46 .",
    "in this case , by applying @xmath42 to our data , we obtain @xmath47 the noise term @xmath48 can strongly affect the high - spatial - frequency components of this solution , and thus some regularization strategy must normally be adopted to separate the source signals once @xmath42 has been estimated .",
    "we intentionally do not face this point in the present work , which is entirely dedicated to the study of the capabilities of by itself .",
    "another general feature that one should keep in mind is that the quality of the estimated matrix @xmath42 becomes worse when one or more signals are much stronger then the others , even if the reconstructed spatial patterns of the independent components are still good . indeed , suppose for simplicity to have no noise , two frequency scalings and two independent components only .",
    "then , from eq .",
    "( [ noisytransform ] ) it can be easily seen that at each output @xmath49 one has @xmath50 if , for example , @xmath51 , then a good _ spatial _",
    "reconstruction for which @xmath49 is a copy of @xmath52 can be achieved even in the case where the coefficients of @xmath52 and @xmath53 are comparable , or , in other words , the matrix @xmath42 is not a robust estimator of @xmath46 .",
    "the algorithm needs a preprocessing step ( hyvrinen 1999 ) , where the data maps are `` quasi whitened '' .",
    "this step aims at reducing the number of unknowns with respect to the original problem .",
    "let us suppose we know the covariance matrix @xmath54 of the system noise .",
    "the mean of the data at each frequency is removed ( the offset of each independent component can be recovered in the end of the separation process , as we show below ) , and the covariance matrix @xmath55 of the zero mean data is calculated by just evaluating the following expectation over the set of all available pixels : @xmath56 the preprocessing procedure consists in evaluating a modified noise covariance and a quasi - whitened data set , respectively , as follows : @xmath57 @xmath58 the separation algorithm estimates the matrix @xmath42 row by row , thus permitting to recover the components one by one .",
    "let @xmath59 be an @xmath19-dimensional vector whose dot - product by @xmath60 gives a component of the transformed vector @xmath61 ( @xmath62 is a row of matrix @xmath42 ) .",
    "in order to find a noise - robust estimation of one such vector , we apply the following iterative algorithm , equipped with a suitable convergence criterion , where @xmath63 is a regular non - quadratic function whose form can be chosen as @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 for most problems ( see hyvrinen 1999 ) , and @xmath67 is its first derivative :    1 .",
    "choose an initial vector @xmath59 ; 2 .",
    "update it through @xmath68 where again @xmath69 denotes expectation over all the available samples ; 3 .",
    "let @xmath70 4 .",
    "compare @xmath71 with the old one ; if not converged , go back to ( ii ) , if converged , begin another process .",
    "this procedure maximizes the non - gaussianity of the component @xmath72 .",
    "let us assume that a certain number , @xmath73 , of rows of @xmath74 have been evaluated . to estimate the ( @xmath75)-th row , we must search it in the subspace orthogonal to the first @xmath73 rows . to achieve this goal ,",
    "an orthogonalization step ( _ e.g. _ gram - schmidt ) must be inserted between steps ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "once the separation matrix @xmath42 has been found , physical normalization , frequency scalings and offsets of each independent component in the data can in principle be reconstructed .",
    "consider normalization and frequency scalings first : by simply inverting eq .",
    "( [ noisytransform ] ) , we get @xmath76 which means that the independent component @xmath77 present in @xmath38 contributes to the signal at @xmath12th frequency : @xmath78 then , the frequency scaling for the component @xmath79 between frequencies @xmath12 and @xmath80 is given by @xmath81 the offsets can be recovered as follows .",
    "true input data can be written as the sum of zero mean component plus mean values , indicated as @xmath38 and @xmath82 respectively .",
    "the zero mean component is reconstructed as in eq .",
    "( [ scalings ] ) , while the total signal obeys : @xmath83 then , by simply taking the mean of this expression we get @xmath84 so that , at @xmath12th frequency , the offset of the independent component @xmath79 is @xmath85 furthermore we can derive the signal - to - noise ratio in the reconstructed map . since the system noise covariance matrix @xmath86 is assumed to be known , it is possible to build noise constrained realizations @xmath87 for each frequency channel .",
    "once the matrix @xmath42 has been recovered , the corresponding noise realizations in the outputs @xmath88 are @xmath89 the noise is then transformed like signals and an estimation of the noise into the reconstructed components is achievable .",
    "from these `` processed '' noise it is straightforward to obtain the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this is a useful tool when , e.g. , the number of underlying components is not known a - priori .",
    "suppose , for example , that the number @xmath19 of observing channels is larger than the number @xmath13 of the underlying sky components .",
    "using all the channels leads to the recovery of @xmath19 `` components '' , the fictitious ones being characterized by a signal - to - noise ratio of the order , or below , unity .",
    "in the next section we shall show results on simulated skies which are not too far from what the planck satellite should observe , including the instrumental noise . however , we preferred to approach that case gradually , inserting here a section which starts with highly idealized skies and ends just one step before the planck case .",
    "we want to test the capabilities of the algorithm when components are well known and controlled , allowing a better understanding of the more realistic simulation of the next section .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as we can see from table  [ tablescalings ] , frequency scalings are recovered very well , at the percent level , for the cmb and thermal components , while the error is considerably larger for synchrotron , which is the weakest component in this case .      for this analysis , we selected two channels , 217 and 353 ghz , and two components , cmb and thermal emission which",
    ", at these frequencies , is dominated by dust . maps with @xmath90=1024 have been smoothed with a fwhm of 5@xmath4 . as in case 1 , we have made separate analyses for the whole sky , and for the high and low galactic latitude regions .",
    "the average signal - to - noise ratio for the dust is 190 over the whole sky , 246 for @xmath91 , and 6.6 at high galactic latitude ; for the cmb it is @xmath92 .",
    "the results are reported in figures .",

    ".2 in .3 in .2 in .3 in .2 in .3 in",
    "we have presented a first application of a new , computationally fast , technique for separation of astrophysical components , based on independent component analysis concepts , .",
    "the technique has been applied both to toy models , useful to highlight some of its key properties , and to simulated all - sky maps , with reference to the forthcoming planck mission ( mandolesi et al .",
    "1998 ; puget et al . 1998 ) .",
    ".2 in .3 in .2 in .3 in .2 in .3 in    we have achieved a considerable improvement over the previous application of ica - type algorithms to astrophysical component separation ( see baccigalupi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "first of all , the method is considerably faster : processing of all - sky maps with @xmath94 sky pixels ( pixel size of 3.5 ) took approximately ten minutes on a pentium iii 600 mhz computer .",
    "this is much less than required by any existing non - blind separation methods like maximum entropy , taking 6 hours on 30 processors at equivalent resolution ( stolyarov et al .",
    "second , we have shown that works in the presence of instrumental noise , although under the simplifying assumption that it is white and uniformly distributed .",
    "third , the algorithm was successfully applied both to all - sky maps and to limited portions of the sky . using the full all sky maps",
    "obviously minimizes the sample variance . on the other hand",
    ", we have shown that the foreground removal improves if we cut regions ( around the galactic plane ) where their distribution is highly non - uniform .",
    "furthermore , we extended the formalism of the separation algorithm in order to obtain the normalization constants to convert output maps in physical units .",
    "we found that the accuracy on this calibration is limited only by the instrumental noise .",
    "the same noise effect limits the frequency scaling reconstruction . on the other hand , still requires that all the input maps have the same angular resolution .",
    "we applied to different combinations of planck frequency channels , namely 30 , 44 , 100 , 143 , 217 , 353 ghz , containing a mixture of cmb , synchrotron and thermal emissions , the latter comprising free - free plus thermal dust emission .",
    "the nominal average instrumental noise levels and angular resolutions of planck have been adopted .    with all these ingredients ,",
    "is able to obtain an excellent reconstruction ( well calibrated ) of all these components .",
    "the angular power spectra of both cmb and thermal emissions can be accurately reconstructed up to multipoles @xmath93 .",
    "synchrotron is also recovered on all scales where our template has significant power , i.e. up to @xmath95 . frequency scalings and normalization are recovered up to better than 1% precision .",
    "nevertheless , a lot of work to assess the real capabilities of this and other component separation algorithms for cmb experiments has still to be done .",
    "here we list our main simplifying assumptions , which we have to relax in future .",
    "the spectral properties of synchrotron and dust emissions have been assumed to be constant over the sky , although it is known that both the synchrotron spectral index and the dust temperature vary from place to place .",
    "the spatial pattern of free - free emission was assumed to follow that of dust , which is certainly over - simplistic . spinning dust emission",
    "was not taken into account .",
    "we also neglected extra - galactic sources , which are expected to contribute significantly on all planck channels , as well as the thermal and kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich effect .",
    "very promising point - source extraction techniques are being extensively studied ( cayn et al . 2000 ; vielva et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "finally , the instrumental noise is not uniform across the sky , as assumed here , but has a complex pattern determined by the adopted scanning strategy adopted . also the instrumental beam is not perfectly circularly symmetric , etc .",
    "despite all these still unaddressed issues , we demonstrated that is a very promising technique because of three main features : @xmath96 the good separation achieved on our simulated maps , which contained noise at the planck nominal level , @xmath97 the high computational speed , and @xmath98 the extreme flexibility of the code , which is able to work on all - sky maps as well as on arbitrarily shaped sky regions in a straightforward way .",
    "we recall also that is a blind separation algorithm , able to estimate not only independent components present in the data , but also their frequency scalings .",
    "we wish to warmly thank all the planck low frequency instrument data processing center for having supported this work .",
