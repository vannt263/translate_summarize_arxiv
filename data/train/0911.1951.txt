    "among many propositions for the physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , supersymmetry ( susy ) is generally considered most elegant and respected . it can accommodate or explain some of the outstanding problems of the sm .",
    "in fact this is the only mathematically consistent uv completion of the sm that stabilizes the gap between electroweak and planck scales .",
    "it provides the gauge coupling unification , radiative electroweak symmetry breaking , a candidate for dark matter ( dm ) , offers new ideas on the matter - antimatter asymmetry etc .",
    "the simplest n=1 supersymmetric extension calls for each sm particle a sparticle that differs in spin by half a unit .",
    "the lagrangian must be supplemented by susy breaking terms that keep unseen superpartners out of the current experimental reach while retaining all goodies of the model : renormalizability and perturbatively stable hierarchy of scales . with ever improving experimental constraints on susy breaking parameters , mainly from flavor and higgs physics ,",
    "the model building of successful susy breaking scenarios becomes more and more difficult .",
    "however , the successes of susy do not rely on its simplest realization .",
    "in fact , non - minimal realizations may ameliorate some of the above problems .",
    "for example , dirac gauginos ( in contrast to majorana in n=1 ) forbid some of the couplings and may lead to additional suppression of loop contributions with gauginos in flavor - changing processes .",
    "such scenarios can be based on d - term supersymmetry breaking models @xcite or continuous r - symmetries @xcite .",
    "a dirac gaugino requires additional fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "they can be provided by adding chiral super - multiplets in the adjoint representations of the corresponding gauge group , as realised in n=2 susy @xcite .",
    "when extending to n=2 , the additional supersymmetry also requires the introduction of mirror matter superfields . in order to avoid chirality problems the n=2 mirror ( s)fermions have to be assumed to be heavy .",
    "thus effectively we consider a hybrid model that expands to n=2 only in the gaugino sector  @xcite .    here",
    "we will present elements of the phenomenology of the scalar partner of the dirac gluino ( sgluon ) , as worked out in a recent paper  @xcite ; see also  @xcite . for an independent analysis of sgluons at the lhc",
    ", we refer to ref .",
    "if gluinos are seen at the lhc one of the main experimental goals will be to verify if they are majorana or dirac fermions . to address properly this issue a theoretical model",
    "is needed that allows a smooth dirac / majorana transition , as for example the hybrid model constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in n=1 gluinos are majorana fields with two degrees of freedom to match gluons in the color - octet vector super - multiplet .",
    "to provide the two additional degrees of freedom for dirac fields , the usual n=1 gluon / gluino @xmath0 super - multiplet @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is supplemented by an additional n=1 color - octet chiral super - multiplet @xmath3 of extra gluinos @xmath4 and scalar @xmath5 fields to form a vector hyper - multiplet of n=2 susy .",

    "quark and squark fields interact only with the standard gluino , @xmath15 since only their mirror partners ( assumed to be heavy ) couple to @xmath9 , as required by n=2 susy .",
    "soft supersymmetry breaking generates masses for the gluino fields @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath16 diagonal terms are induced by the individual majorana mass parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 while an off - diagonal term corresponds to the dirac mass .",
    "it can arise from the d term , @xmath19 when a hidden sector spurion field @xmath20 gets a vacuum expectation value , @xmath21 , the dirac mass is generated , @xmath22 .",
    "diagonalization of ( [ eq : gluinomass ] ) gives rise to two majorana mass eigenstates , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , with masses @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "there are two limiting cases of interest : in the limit @xmath27 the standard majorana gluino is recovered ; in the limit of vanishing majorana mass parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 with @xmath28 , the mixing is maximal and the two majorana gluino states are degenerate .",
    "one can draw a smooth path interpolating these two limiting cases by introducing an auxiliary parameter @xmath29 $ ] and parameterizing @xmath30 , @xmath31 . with @xmath32",
    "kept fixed , the parameter @xmath33 allows for a continuous transition from @xmath34 , where the standard limit is reached with one majorana gluino ( the second being infinitely heavy ) , to @xmath35 that corresponds to two degenerate majorana fields combined to a dirac gluino @xmath36    the phenomenology of dirac gluinos is characteristically different from majorana .",

    "although sgluons are r - parity even , they can not be singly produced at tree level in gluon - gluon or quark - antiquark collision .",
    "this is so because they couple only in pairs to gluons , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , as required by the gauge symmetry , and singly only to dirac gluino pairs via the yukawa - type gauge interaction @xmath52 where @xmath53 are the su(3)@xmath54 structure constants .",

    "the color - octet scalars , sgluons , can be copiously produced at the lhc since they carry large color charge .",
