    "high resolution _ hst _ images of the cas  a remnant were obtained on 46 march 2004 and 45 december 2004 using the wide field channel ( wfc ) of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the acs / wfc consists of two @xmath25 ccds with an average image pixel scale of @xmath26 providing a @xmath27 field of view .",
    "four 2-point line dithered images were taken in each of the four acs / wfc sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) filters , namely f450w , f625w , f775w , and f850lp ( i.e. , sdss g , r , i , and z ) , at each target position to permit cosmic ray removal , coverage of the @xmath28 interchip gap , and to minimize saturation effects of bright stars in the target fields .",
    "total integration times in the f450w , f625w , f775w , and f850lp filters were 2000 s , 2400 s , 2000 s , and 2000 s , respectively .",

    "we measured outer knot acs / wfc fluxes from the three remaining sdss filter image sets using the automated source extraction software package sextractor @xcite . in cases where the sextractor program failed to return a reasonable flux or failed to return a flux at all ,",
    "the knot fluxes were calculated by hand . in all cases ,",
    "the fluxes were calculated using 5 pixel apertures .",
    "background estimates were performed by sextractor using a @xmath31 pixel rectangular annulus about the isophotal limits of the object .",
    "when fluxes were calculated manually , background estimation was performed by calculating the total @xmath32 pixel aperture flux in at least five positions near the object ( avoiding other sources ) and then subtracting the mean computed `` background '' flux from the total object pixel sum .",
    "most knots whose fluxes required manual computation were located near a bright background source or very close to another ejecta knot .",
    "high - velocity , outer ejecta knots were identified through proper motion measurements on the march and december 2004 acs / wfc images @xcite .",
    "ejecta knots were defined as being high - velocity if their epoch 2004.3 radial distance exceeded 100@xmath33 from the remnant s center of expansion ( v@xmath34 5500 km s@xmath2 ) and they showed a proper motion @xmath5",
    "@xmath35 yr@xmath2 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we used the filter fluxes to bin outlying ejecta knots into three emission classes ; namely , strong [ n  ii ] @xmath236548,6583 emission knots , strong [ o  ii ] @xmath237319,7330 emission knots , and strong [ s  ii ] @xmath236716,6731 fmk - like knots .",
    "flux ratio criteria between these three classes were chosen to segregate knots with similar ratios seen for main shell or outer ejecta knots with existing spectroscopic data .",
    "for example , outlying ejecta knots whose @xmath36   spectra show largely just [ n  ii ] @xmath236548,6583 emission like those discussed by @xcite exhibit f625w / f775w and f625w / f850lp ratios more than an order of magnitude larger than [ s  ii ] bright knots .",
    "in similar fashion , the newly discovered outlying o - rich knots which show a 6000 - 7500   spectrum with strong [ o  i ] and [ o  ii ] line emissions @xcite , exhibit the o / s sensitive f775w / f850lp ratio several times greater than even strong [ o  ii ] @xmath237319,7330 emission main shell knots .    specifically , we chose a flux ratio for f775w/(f625w + f850lp ) @xmath5 1.0 to separate out the [ o  ii ] strong fmks from the [ s  ii ] strong fmks ; that is , those knots with stronger [ o  ii ] @xmath237319,7330 emission detected via the f775w filter than the combined strength of [ n  ii ] , [ s  iii ] and [ s  ii ] emissions detected in the f625w and f850lp filters .",
    "similarly , knots with strong [ n  ii ] emissions were selected via f625w/(f775w + f850lp ) @xmath5 1.0 , thereby selecting those knots where the combined flux of [ o  i ] @xmath236300,6364 , [ s  ii ] @xmath236716,6731 , and [ n  ii ] @xmath236548,6583 emissions was greater than the sum of f775w flux , due mostly to [ o  ii ] , and f850lp flux sensitive to the near - infrared [ s  iii ] and [ s  ii ] emissions . since [ o  i ] @xmath236300,6364 flux rarely , if ever , exceeds the [ o  ii ] @xmath237319,7330 flux , and the observed [ s  ii ] @xmath236716,6731 emission is unlikely to ever exceed the combined flux of [ s  iii ] @xmath239069,9531 plus [ s  ii ] @xmath231028710370 line emissions @xcite , then any knot for which the f625w/(f775w + f850lp ) @xmath5 1.0 requires the presence of significant [ n  ii ] @xmath236548,6583 emission .",
    "examination of march and december 2004 acs / wfc images revealed a total of 1825 high proper motion ( @xmath37 yr@xmath2 ) ejecta knots around the cas  a remnant @xcite .",
    "this is a much larger population of high - velocity ejecta knots than previously identified or suspected from ground - based images @xcite .",
    "a total of @xmath38 strong [ n  ii ] emission , @xmath39 strong [ o  ii ] emission , and @xmath40 fmk - like knots were identified .",
    "although nearly half of the 1825 cataloged outer knots were found in the ne jet , high - velocity outlying ejecta were identified in many other regions around the remnant .",
    "outlying optical ejecta knots range from 105@xmath33 to 300@xmath33 in radial distance from the center of expansion , placing them in projection close to or outside the remnant s @xmath8 6000 km s@xmath2 forward shock front as determined by the remnant s outermost x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the location and distribution of these knots with respect to the remnant s outer x - ray emission filaments associated with the forward shock front can be seen in figure 1 .",
    "here we show the locations of all 1825 cataloged outer knots projected onto the 1 msec _",
    "acis image ( epoch 2004.3 ; @xcite ) .",
    "knot positions are marked with open circles color coded either red , green , or blue to indicate those knots with spectra dominated by strong [ n  ii ] @xmath236548,6583 , [ o  ii ] @xmath237319,7330 , or [ s  ii ] @xmath236716,6731 line emissions , respectively .    the transverse expansion velocities of cas  a s outermost ejecta ( fig .",
    "1 ) show a strongly aspherical structure due principally to the ne and sw jets which appear as distinct and roughly opposing features ; ne jet : p.a .",
    "= @xmath41 , sw jet : p.a .",
    "= @xmath7 .",
    "the jets have similar maximum radial distances and proper motion derived expansion velocities ; namely @xmath42 and @xmath43 km s@xmath2 .",
    "they also contain the remnant s highest velocity [ s  ii ] emitting ejecta ( the blue open circles in fig .  1 ) .",
    "this is in contrast to other regions where the nitrogen - rich ejecta ( open red circles ) represent the remnant s highest velocity debris ( @xmath9 km s@xmath2 ) followed by the o - rich ejecta , and then the s - rich knots @xcite .    examination of the _ hst _ images also revealed a lack of outlying ejecta knots along the remnant s northern and southern regions .",
    "not a single ejecta knot could be found along a 55@xmath44 wide region in position angle along the remnant s southern limb ( i.e. , pa = @xmath45 ) and in a narrower 15@xmath44 position angle zone along the north ( pa = @xmath46 ) .",
    "the northern gap would actually be larger if one only considered knots with radial distances greater than @xmath47 in which case the northern gap size grows to @xmath48 in position angle ( pa = @xmath49 ) .",
    "we note that , unlike for the northern limb region , acs images did not completely cover the whole southern limb region imaging only out to a distance of @xmath47 due south of the center of expansion .",
    "however , inspection of ground - based images covering regions farther to the south ( @xmath50 ) revealed no bright farther outlying knots .",
    "thus , despite missing acs / wfc coverage along the south , the lack of any knots at smaller distances like those seen along the east and west edges of the southern gap ( r = @xmath51 ) indicate a strong likelihood that there are simply no bright , high - velocity ejecta knots in either of the nnw and sse directions .",
    "this ne  sw jet / counterjet and nnw  sse gap asymmetry in the distribution of the remnant s outer optical ejecta knots can be clearly seen in the proper motion plots of figure 2 . in the top panel ,",
    "we plot the extrapolated 320 yr proper motion paths for the 1825 identified outer knots based on measured march to december 2004 positions .",
    "the central white circle has a radius of @xmath52 centered on the remnant s estimated center of expansion ( coe ; @xmath53(j2000 ) = @xmath54 , @xmath55(j2000 ) = @xmath56 ; @xcite ) .",
    "although errors in derived knot proper motions lead to some knot trajectories missing the expansion center by substantial distances filling in somewhat the northern and southern gaps , a strongly aspherical distribution of ejecta jets and gaps is readily apparent .",
    "when the proper motion extrapolations are replaced with predicted knot proper motions based solely on march 2004 knot positions and the coe , a structure of opposing jet features and north and south gaps appears even more striking ( fig .  2 , bottom panel ) .",
    "the circle in the figure marks a radial distance of @xmath57 from the coe corresponding to a proper motion of @xmath58 yr@xmath2 for an age of 320 years and an implied @xmath810,000 km s@xmath2 transverse velocity assuming a remnant distance of 3.4 kpc .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , this circle encompasses nearly all the remnant s n - rich outer ejecta away from the jet regions .",
    "peak ne and sw jet optical knot transverse velocities lie at pa = @xmath59 and at pa = @xmath60 , respectively , i.e. , @xmath8180@xmath44 apart .",
    "these position angles are close to those seen also in the x - rays and infrared for the ne and sw jets .",
    "that is , from the 1 ms _ chandra _ @xcite and 24 micron _",
    "images @xcite , we find pa = 63@xmath4465@xmath44 for the center of the ne jet and pa = 246@xmath44248@xmath44 for the center of the sw jet , some @xmath61 apart . while the significance of the northern and southern gaps in the distribution of the outer knots is uncertain ( see below ) , they are situated roughly orthogonal to this ne  sw jet alignment line",
    ". the middles of the southern and northern outer knot gaps lie at pa = @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively , some 107@xmath44 and 99@xmath44 off from a 63@xmath44243@xmath44 alignment line .",
    "lastly , extrapolated late 17th century knot positions relative to the remnant s estimated coe indicates some evidence for non - uniform deceleration around the remnant .",
    "figure 3 ( left panel ) shows the estimated positions for all 1825 outer knots for the @xcite estimated convergent year 1671 .",
    "the estimated coe is marked by the circle ( radius = @xmath52 ) .",
    "here , one sees that the scatter of points for the outer knots is significantly away from the @xcite center , centered instead @xmath64 to the east .",
    "( note : a check using the same 17 outer knots employed by @xcite using the new acs images together with archival images agree with their derived coe . )",
    "one possible cause for this shift eastward is a greater deceleration of knots along different regions around the remnant , particularly along the eastern limb , giving rise to broader and slower average expansion velocities for a given radial distance and look - back time .",
    "a different shift off from the coe is seen when plotting just northern and southern knots ( fig .  3 ; right panel ) . for 416 north and south knots ,",
    "the shift from the coe shows an even greater displacement , namely @xmath65 to the southeast .",
    "although optical debris may constitute only a small fraction of the total ejected mass , cas  a s fastest moving material is perhaps best studied optically . for example",
    ", optical emission from the ne and sw jets can be traced about @xmath66 farther out than in x - rays or infrared @xcite and only a handful of outer optical ejecta knots around the rest of the remnant are detected in even the deepest radio or x - ray images .",
    "fragmentation of sn ejecta into dense clumps may come about by rayleigh - taylor instabilities brought on by the deceleration of the ejecta by the ambient medium @xcite , passage of the reverse shock @xcite , or inside the progenitor during the sn explosion @xcite .",
    "optical emission will arise when @xmath18100 km s@xmath2 internal shocks are formed in the clumps driven by the high stagnation pressure behind the clump s bow shock .",
    "@xcite studied similarity solutions for sn blast waves driven by clumpy ejecta and found that such clumps will eventually move ahead of a remnant s forward shock front .",
    "he concluded that this process may be a generic feature of snrs with clumped ejecta .",
    "the presence of numerous dense and relatively cool optically emitting , high - velocity ejecta knots out ahead of cas  a s forward shock front supports hamilton s basic results .",
    "namely , we find a significant number of optical outer ejecta knots lying ( in projection ) outside the faint x - ray emitting filaments marking the current location of the remnant s forward blast wave @xcite .",
    "asymmetries in cas  a s outermost debris may offer clues as to the nature of the sn explosion engine .",
    "what one observes at a particular epoch , however , may not necessarily reflect the sn s true explosion dynamics .",
    "ejecta velocities will be modified ( to varying degrees ) by passage through the ambient medium as ejecta knots are only made optically visible due to this interaction , and more knots will be visible in regions where there is more circumstellar material .",
    "the detected distribution can also change with time since some 1020% of outer optical knots vary significantly in brightness over just a few years due presumably to variable interaction with a clumpy csm @xcite .",
    "in addition , for a knot to be visible it must be sufficiently large and dense to generate detectable forbidden line emission .",
    "it must also survive disruption via mass ablation from kelvin - helmhotz instabilities during passage through the reverse shock , forward shock , and the surrounding ambient medium .",
    "consequently , what one sees can be a distorted and biased view of the true distribution of a remnant s outer debris .",
    "nonetheless , even with all these caveats , the asymmetry and non - uniformity of the remnant s outermost optical ejecta as seen in the plots of figure 2 is striking .",
    "the ne and sw jets extend out to nearly @xmath67 , more than twice the radius of the remnant s main emission shell , and lie on virtually opposite sides of the remnant s center of expansion .",
    "the jets also appear to lie roughly in the plane of the sky to within @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "this combination of an opposing , sulfur - rich jet / counterjet structure with similar maximum expansion velocities plus gaps of high - velocity ejecta aligned roughly perpendicular is suggestive of an aspherical , bipolar expansion .    from 2-d models , @xcite calculated that a progenitor s axisymmetric wind structure , where the highest density lay in the equatorial plane , could generate bipolar protrusions of sn ejecta extending @xmath69 times the radius of the main shell .",
    "the relative scale of such expansion asymmetry is not unlike that seen in the cas  a jets and only a mild asymmetry ( @xmath70/@xmath71 @xmath18 2 ) is needed to form obvious protrusions . while significant heavy element material can end up at much larger radial distances than elsewhere , the original progenitor chemical layering should largely persist within the protrusion .",
    "that is , the highest velocity material should mainly exhibit the chemical abundances of the progenitor s outermost layers , namely n , he , and o. however , just the opposite is observed .",
    "the farther out one goes in either of cas  a s jets , the weaker oxygen emission lines become relative to those of sulfur @xcite .    the fact that one sees largely undecelerated ejecta throughout the remnant with @xmath72 ( see @xcite ) indicates that the observed compositional structure is set early in the explosion .",
    "in addition , outside of the jet regions , the s - rich material has a much more limited velocity range .",
    "all this suggests that the s - rich ne jet , rather than reflecting some sort of turbulent mixing region or a rapid expansion into surrounding ism / csm due to a lower surrounding density , more likely represents a true stream of high - speed ejecta formed when underlying material was ejected up through the star s outer layers .",
    "other observational evidence in favor of an ejection of underlying material comes from the location of the so - called ` mixed ejecta knots ' and from energy estimates in the jet region .",
    "mixed ejecta knots show both nitrogen and sulfur overabundances , which could have resulted from turbulent mixing of h and n - rich layers with underlying s and o - rich layers , are only seen in the jet regions @xcite .",
    "the acs / wfc images show that many of the mixed knots are not the result of line - of - sight superposition of knots with different chemical make - up but appear to be ejecta with mixed chemical properties @xcite .",
    "in addition , from an analysis of _ chandra _ x - ray data , @xcite found a shallower outer envelope near the base of the ne jet which they interpreted as indicating more of the initial explosion s energy being directed in this polar direction as opposed to equatorial . on the other hand , however , while the prominent shell rupture near the base of the ne jet seen in x - rays and radio images might be seen as supporting evidence for this picture @xcite , there is no obvious main shell rupture near the sw counterjet .",
    "although our _ hst _ survey of the highest - velocity ejecta in cas  a makes a compelling case for a high - velocity bipolar expansion , what the jets and gaps are telling us about the underlying core - collapse mechanism is unclear .",
    "currently , there is no consensus as to the details of the explosion process for core - collapse sne except that models with completely spherical neutrino heating mechanisms fail to yield successful explosions @xcite .",
    "this has led to considerable effort to understanding the effects of rotation on neutrino heating and the importance of magnetic fields in the proto - neutron star .    around the rotation axis of a collapsing star",
    ", accretion flow will be non - spherical and accelerated thereby lowering the needed critical neutrino luminosity @xcite .",
    "the degree of neutrino re - vitalization of the shock front created by the core - bounce may also be affected by convection in the proto - neutron star through the mechanical outward transfer of neutrinos .",
    "investigations into the effects of rotation on the anisotropic neutrino emission from the proto - neutron star indicate a weakening of the core bounce that seeds the neutrino - drive convection , with angular momentum tending to stabilize the core , constraining convection to the polar regions @xcite .",
    "models of anisotropic neutrino radiation indicate more powerful explosions are generated , which then lead to a prolate expansion geometry @xcite . @xcite",
    "found the bipolar expansion was not strongly collimated ( @xmath73 ) unless the rotation rate was large .    for cas  a , @xcite favored a rotation enhanced , neutrino - driven model in which the x - ray observed fe - rich se and nw regions , and not the ne and sw jet / counterjet , mark the progenitor s rotation axis . instead of driving the explosion , the ne  sw jets would have formed following the neutrino - driven main explosion via an under - energetic jet - like ejection created by an mhd jet or proto - neutron star wind ( possibly associated with accretion by the ns ; @xcite ) emerging into an already expanding debris field . but",
    "this model requires a nearly 90@xmath44 post - explosion precession of the ns s rotation axis from nw  se to ne ",
    "sw @xcite , the cause of which is left unexplained .    on the other hand , models of magnetorotationally induced jets capable of generating sn explosions have also been invoked to explain the cas  a jets @xcite . in this view",
    ", rotation leads to magnetic field amplification thereby generating non - relativistic axial jets of mhd energy @xmath74 erg which then initiate a bipolar supernova explosion .",
    "this is somewhat analogous to the narrow relativistic jets proposed in the collapsar model as the central engine for grbs .",
    "@xcite questioned the accuracy of anisotropic jet explosion simulations and @xcite argue that if the cas  a jets were driven by outflowing core material they should be fe - rich instead of the s and si rich material observed .",
    "if cas  a s ne and sw jets were driven by ni - rich material , the energy deposited by radioactive @xmath17ni decay might have created hot , low density ni - rich bubbles .",
    "this could make fe - rich material in the jets today too cool for detection in x - rays while also being too diffuse and low density to detect as optically bright knots .",
    "furthermore , while both the ne and sw jets can be traced farthest out in the optical , optical studies have never detected appreciable fe - rich material anywhere in cas  a. optical fe line emissions are weak and hard to detect in even the brightest main shell knots and there is no optical fe - rich material seen corresponding to the fe - rich se and n regions observed in the x - rays @xcite .",
    "morphologically , both mhd jet and neutrino - driven expansion models produce aspherical ` jets ' with axial expansion ratios around 2 like those seen for cas  a @xcite .",
    "although much of the ne jet s central and farthest extending line of optical filaments lie virtually in the plane of the sky @xcite , knots lying at a projected radial distance of 150170 arcsec out from the coe show radial velocities from @xmath75 to @xmath76 km s@xmath2 , indicating an expansion cone about @xmath77 wide @xcite .",
    "this means that the ne jet is more like a fan of several streams of ejecta knots ( rather than a single narrow jet ) , about as deep as it appears wide , i.e. , about @xmath78 .",
    "this is consistent with their appearance on x - ray and infrared images which show both jets as two or three ejecta streams rather than one single narrowly focused line of emission .",
    "for example , there are three main optical lines of knots in the ne jet which correlate with x - ray and ir emission fingers . although the sw jet is optically much less well - defined , the locations of the outermost [ s  ii ] emitting ejecta correlate reasonably well with the x - ray and ir emission ` fingers ' .    beside the jets , a possible additional clue as to the nature of the central core - collapse sn engine",
    "may be the absence of high - speed ejecta along the north and south limbs .",
    "not all proposed core - collapse models show a pronounced decrease in outermost expansion velocity suggested by the nearly opposing ejecta gaps revealed in the _ hst _ data ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "however , similar gaps in the distribution of slower moving ejecta are not found in the remnant s main emission ring of reverse shocked debris based on radio , x - ray , and optical maps .",
    "while the remnant s forward shock shows no decrease in these directions as one might expect if the expansion velocity was significantly lower in these northern and southern gap regions @xcite , a gap in the forward shock front would be rapidly filled by the blast wave advancing in from the sides .",
    "thus , while the north and south ejecta gaps are interesting especially given their positions relative to the jets , their meaning is presently unclear .",
    "nevertheless , if these gaps are truly found to be areas devoid of high - speed ejecta seen elsewhere around the remnant and orthogonal to the ne / sw jets they may provide some insight for testing core - collapse models .      first - light images of cas a taken by the _",

    "although its nature is uncertain , this object is likely to be a neutron star but not a pulsar due to a lack of radio pulsations , no detected x - ray or radio plerion , and an x - ray spectrum too steep for an ordinary pulsar @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that it may be a younger and less luminous example of a subclass of neutron stars known as anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) @xcite .",
    "x - ray emission bursts from axps and sgrs together with their spin - down rates have been explained by a magnetar model in which a neutron star has a much higher surface magnetic field of @xmath79 g than ordinary pulsars @xcite . except for a lack of pulsations , the general properties of the cas a xps and other x - ray emitting but radio quiet compact central objects in fairly young snrs are not all that dissimilar from axps and sgrs @xcite .",

    "although 3d core - collapse models suggest neutrino asymmetries as well as disruption of binaries by symmetric explosions may be insufficient to generate the wide range of observed ` kick ' pulsar velocities @xcite , mhd driven explosions creating unbalanced jets just might @xcite .    however , the motion of the remnant s xps is far from being in alignment with cas  a s ne  sw jets . using the initial _ chandra _ derived position along with subsequent positional measurements using archival _",
    "rosat _ and _ einstein _ image data @xcite , @xcite estimated a @xmath81 displacement of the xps from their derived center of expansion . assuming a common origin for the xps and the expanding ejecta , they estimated a transverse velocity of @xmath82330 km s@xmath2 for a distance of 3.4 kpc . adopting an updated position of the xps ( 2004 epoch ; @xcite ) , the displacement of the xps from the @xcite remnant expansion center is @xmath83 with an implied motion in a southeasterly direction ( position angle = @xmath84 ;",
    "see fig .  4 , left panel ) . assuming a current remnant age @xmath8 325 yr ( see discussion in @xmath245.4 )",
    ", we find a slightly higher transverse velocity of around 350 km s@xmath2 for a distance of 3.4 kpc .",
    "the apparent southernly direction of motion for the xps is roughly orthogonal to the jet - counterjet alignment line , making an asymmetric jet - induced ` kick ' explanation problematic .",
    "interestingly however , the projected motion of the xps is toward the middle of the broad southern gap in the distribution of the outer ejecta knots ( fig .  4 ; right panel ) .",
    "if the distribution of the optically emitting outer ejecta knots is giving us a true picture of the asymmetry in the cas  a supernova expansion , then the neutron star s preference to move in a direction lacking in high velocity material may indicate a natal kick aligned with the progenitor s slowest velocity expansion , possibly the progenitor s equatorial region .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have proposed that magnetars could receive natal kicks in part due to their intense magnetic fields which could lead to anisotropic neutrino emissions . however , unlike the case seen here for cas a , these kicks would be in the direction of the rotation axis  which the ne  sw jets would seem to mark . while some misalignments between the progenitor s spin axis and a neutron star s velocity vector have been reported @xcite , including the high velocity pulsar b1508 + 55 ( v@xmath85 @xmath8 1100 km s@xmath2 ; @xcite )",
    ", there is not strong observational evidence for general misalignments @xcite .",
    "moreover , although some binary disruption type models have been proposed to explain natal kicks perpendicular to the spin axis ( e.g. , @xcite ) , no clear picture has emerged on how such a misalignment would be produced or even whether such models apply to the case of cas  a.      although only nine months separated the two sets of acs / wfc images , the large number of outer knots identified ( 1825 ) permitted us to estimate the dynamical age of the cas  a snr . assuming the coe derived by @xcite and no knot deceleration since the time of the explosion , we show in figure 5 ( left panel ) the estimated arrival date of the 1825 cataloged outlying ejecta knots to within the minimum least squared distance to the coe plotted versus cataloged knot identification number @xcite . in this figure ,",
    "symbol size is inversely proportional to estimated proper motion uncertainty .",
    "knot catalog ids are in order of increasing position angle with the ne jet knots ( i d numbers @xmath18 100  950 ) making up a substantial fraction ( @xmath1845% ) of the 1825 cataloged knots .",
    "the dispersion in estimated knot convergent dates is not uniform as a function of position angle .",
    "for example , for the middle section of the ne jet where many of the fastest ejecta are found ( i.e. , knot ids @xmath86 ) , a decrease in the range of estimated knot arrival dates can be seen in figure 5 ( left panel ) .",
    "this decrease reflects more accurate proper motion values due mainly to the larger radial distances for jet knots from the coe and consequently larger proper motion values leading to smaller percentage measurement errors .",
    "the average arrival date for the 1825 outer knots with undecelerated extrapolated arrival dates between 1580 and 1750 is 1662@xmath8727 yr .",
    "this is consistent with that estimated by @xcite who found an undecelerated convergent date of 1671.3@xmath870.9 based on a sample of 17 especially long - lasting knots for which archival imaging data were available covering a time span of up to 50 years .",
    "because the catalog of 1825 outer knots covered a wide range of sizes and brightnesses leading to a range of proper motion measurement errors , we examined a much smaller , hand - selected sample of 72 knots which are : i ) relatively bright , and ii ) compact in size or unresolved in the acs / wfc images .",
    "this sample included the 17 outer knots used by @xcite for their estimated convergent date .",
    "the results for this smaller sample , shown in figure 5 ( right panel ) , indicate a convergent date @xmath88 , in excellent agreement with the thorstensen et al .  1671 date , shown here as a vertical dashed line .",
    "while ejecta knots must undergo shock heating and hence some deceleration in order to be optically visible , the least decelerated ones offer stronger upper limits to the remnant s age .",
    "as seen in figure 5 , the region near the top of the left - hand plot , i.e. , knot ids from @xmath89 corresponding to position angles @xmath90 respectively , show displacements toward a convergent date later than 1671 , namely @xmath91 .",
    "these 126 knots are located along the remnant s northwest limb and can be seen in the bottom panel of figure 2 as cluster of nw knots .",
    "if we knew the degree of deceleration these northwestern limb knots might have experienced over the @xmath18300 yr age of the remnant , it would give us a better estimate of the remnant s age and therefore the actual cas a sn explosion date .",
    "for example , if knot decelerations were significant then one might be able to rule out on dynamical grounds a proposed but controversial sighting of the cas a sn by rev .",
    "john flamsteed in august 1680 @xcite",
    ".    a knot will undergo deceleration both from the direct interaction with local gas as well as from the internal shock driven into the knot that gives rise to the optical emission observed @xcite .",
    "if treated as a dense undistorted clump , a knot s deceleration due to drag from its interaction with the ambient medium depends on knot velocity and mass , the density of the local medium , and the cross - sectional area of the knot s bow shock which for hypersonic conditions is approximately equal to the knot itself @xcite .",
    "the timescale for knot deceleration ( drag ) is given by @xmath92 @xmath18 @xmath93/@xmath94 where @xmath95 is the density contrast between the knot and the ambient medium ( i.e. , @xmath96/@xmath97 ) , @xmath98 is the knot s radius , and @xmath94 is the knot s velocity @xcite .",
    "based on our acs imaging data , typical outer knots have velocities of 10,000 km s@xmath2 and sizes r @xmath99 corresponding to 0.002 pc at 3.4 kpc .",
    "high - velocity outlying [ s  ii ] emitting knot electron densities lie between 2000  16,000 @xmath100 with typical values between 4000  10,000 @xmath100 @xcite . the ambient density around cas",
    "a is not well determined but is estimated to range between 0.4  3.7 @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "choosing a @xmath95 = 10@xmath101 and an outer ejecta knot velocity of 10,000 km s@xmath2 leads to @xmath92 @xmath18 2000 yr , suggesting that outer knot deceleration due to drag may be fairly small at present .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with a lack of detectable knot deceleration over the last 50 yr and a velocity change of @xmath102 5% over 300 yr @xcite .",
    "while model simulations suggest that shocked clumps become flattened ( i.e. , laterally spread ) which would increase their cross section and hence enhance the deceleration , radiative cooling might partially counteract this effect leading to clump breakup into a cluster of smaller , denser knots .",
    "cloud - ism interaction models suggest knot disruption might also occur due to rayleigh - taylor and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities , again resulting in the generation of smaller , dense knot fragments @xcite .",
    "the timescale for initial knot breakup under these conditions , @xmath103 , is uncertain but is likely to be a few ` cloud crushing times ' @xcite or @xmath103 @xmath18 4 @xmath104/@xmath94 . for the knot numbers assumed above",
    ", the disruption timescale is @xmath18 50 yr , meaning the remnant s highest - velocity ejecta clumps might well have already undergone breakup into denser knots .",
    "thus , both radiative cooling effects and dynamical instabilities might help explain the observed small - scale clustering of some of the remnant s outer ejecta knots ( see @xcite ) .",
    "knot deceleration from internal shock passage will cause the largest error in convergent date if it has occurred recently , and given the @xmath105 year lifetimes of most optical knots in cas a @xcite , this is probably the case .",
    "the effective shock deceleration is equal to the internal knot shock velocity for post - shock emission @xcite .",
    "the shock speed must be at least 30 @xmath106 to produce significant [ n  ii ] , [ s  ii ] and [ o  ii ] emissions ( e.g .. @xcite ) . based on the blair et al .",
    "( 2000 ) shock models , shock speeds above about 500 @xmath107 will ionize the oxygen to the helium - like ionization state and higher , reducing the cooling rate by an order of magnitude .",
    "if the outer portions of the snr are roughly in pressure equilibrium , the density is proportional to v@xmath108 , further reducing the cooling rate behind fast shocks .",
    "consequently , shocks above about 500 @xmath106 will have cooling times longer than the age of cas a , and will appear as x - ray rather than optical emission features .",
    "thus the observed knots have been decelerated by 30 to 500 @xmath107 , or 0.3 to 5% of their @xmath1810,000 km s@xmath2 apparent speeds .",
    "this corresponds to an error in convergence time of 0.003 to 0.05 times 320 yr , or 1 to 15 yr , well within the 19 yr uncertainty in the convergence time of the least decelerated northern limb knots .",
    "we conclude that our convergence times estimates are not likely to be significantly affected by knot deceleration . therefore , while the seemingly less decelerated knots located along the remnant s northern limb suggest an explosion date somewhat later than 1670 , overall the measurements are still consistent with a possible sighting of the cas a sn in 1680 .",
    "follow - up acs imaging obtain in a few years may be able to settle this issue more definitely through a firmer estimate of the date for the cas a supernova outburst .",
