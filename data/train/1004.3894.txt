    "time - driven systems represent a major focus in several versatile research fields , such as the physics of atoms , molecules or mesoscopic systems @xcite .",
    "generally , they are evoked by the occurrence of time - periodic forces . as an example",
    ", the dipole interaction of atoms exposed to laser fields gives rise to several interesting phenomena like laser stabilization , high harmonic generation or above barrier ionization .",
    "another example is the coherent control of quantum molecular dynamics by means of shaped femtosecond laser pulses .    among the most prominent mesoscopic systems are the various driven lattice setups , i.e. particles in an one - dimensional static potential",
    "are acted upon additionally by external time - dependent forces of zero mean .",
    "experimentally they have been realized in condensed matter @xcite and cold atomic systems ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "a remarkable observation is that these systems can show directed transport for an ensemble of particles , although there exists no net force .",
    "therefore , they are called ratchets . originally the generation of ratchet effects has been addressed by employing external noise @xcite . similarly , the role of dissipation has been studied thoroughly . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that directed transport occurs for underdamped particles in a sinusoidally rocked spatially asymmetric periodic potential . moreover , as the amplitude of the external driving is varied , the current flow is reversed several times .",
    "the underlying mechanism responsible for the existence of directed currents and the reversal of the transport has been identified in refs .",
    "@xcite . due to dissipation transporting attractors in phase space emerge and by choosing the initial conditions appropriately it is possible to populate them selectively .",
    "the ratchet effect can also be generated in systems without dissipation and noise . in this case one",
    "speaks of `` ( deterministic ) hamiltonian ratchets '' .",
    "recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite the directed transport of atoms in a bec loaded into a flashing ratchet potential was demonstrated .",
    "the current flow appears only if certain temporal and spatial symmetries of the driven potential , which have been identified in ref .",
    "@xcite , are broken .",
    "the occurrence of directed transport in hamiltonian systems has been reported for the case of fully chaotic dynamics @xcite and for systems with mixed phase space @xcite .",
    "for the latter case @xcite a sum rule for the transport velocity of a classical ensemble of particles has been derived .",
    "additionally , these authors have shown that in the semi - classical limit the quantum and the classical transport velocity coincide . as an extension in ref .",
    "@xcite the impact of avoided crossing between different transporting floquet states has been considered .",
    "tuning the control parameters leads to an enhancement or suppression of the current flow .",
    "moreover , in ref .",
    "@xcite the influence of an additional dc bias on the directed transport of a hamiltonian ratchet has been studied .",
    "the authors have found the persistence of transporting invariant submanifolds like regular islands . in their vicinity trajectories",
    "can get sticky , such that they perform ballistic - like motion .",
    "remaining chaotic trajectories are accelerated by the bias field getting separated very fast from the ballistic type dynamics .",
    "for all previous setups the static potential is exposed to a so - called global driving law @xcite , i.e. the force acting upon the particles can be separated into two parts , which depend only on the spatial coordinate and the time , respectively . for the systems we explore in the present work this is not true anymore .",
    "each potential barrier of the underlying lattice will be equipped with its own characteristic driving law , which gives rise to several new intriguing phenomena and the possibility to `` locally engineer '' the classical phase space . by adjusting carefully the parameters of the barriers and accordingly their driving laws",
    "specific parts of the phase space can be manipulated in a controllable manner , whereas the remaining portion stays mainly unaffected .",
    "moreover , the symmetries derived in @xcite can be broken by imposing spatially dependent phase shifts to the driving laws of the barriers , which will be called a `` phase - modulated lattice '' in the following .",
    "thereby , a directed transport of an ensemble of particles is evoked and both the direction and the magnitude of the current flow can be tuned easily .",
    "importantly , for specific ranges of the barriers potential height the particles show different localization behavior depending on their location within the unit cell of the lattice .",

    "the classical dynamics of an ensemble of identical , non - interacting particles in an one - dimensional , infinitely extended lattice of laterally oscillating square potential barriers of equal height @xmath1 and width @xmath2 is described by the hamiltonian @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mass of the particles and @xmath5 is the potential .",
    "@xmath6 is the equilibrium position of the _ i_-th barrier .",
    "@xmath7 is a function with period @xmath8 , which is explicitly allowed to depend on the site _",
    "i_. in the following , we will call @xmath7 the driving law of the _ i_-th barrier . the hamiltonian is called to be unbiased , if the force @xmath9 averaged over space and time vanishes .",
    "this condition is fulfilled , when each barrier of the lattice is driven with a periodic driving law .",
    "accordingly , a natural choice for @xmath7 is a harmonic function .",
    "therefore we set @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a local phase shift , which depends on the _ i_-th barrier . here",

    "furthermore , we choose for the equilibrium position of the potentials @xmath14 such that the static counterpart of hamiltonian is an equally spaced lattice of identical barriers , i.e. in their equilibrium position they are centered around @xmath15 ( see fig .",

    "[ fig : fig1 ] shows a sketch of the lattice including the relevant parameters . only for very special choices of the phases , e.g. @xmath16 for all @xmath7 ,",
    "neighboring barriers have equal spatial distance at a given snapshot .",
    "schematic illustration of the lattice of laterally oscillating barriers . ]    to avoid overlap of the barriers for arbitrary choices of @xmath17 , the distance between the barriers must obey @xmath18 .",
    "the focus of this work are the transport properties of the system described by the hamiltonian .",
    "let us therefore discuss under which conditions directed transport can occur . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have proven that the directed current vanishes if the equation of motions are invariant under certain transformations , i.e. if certain symmetries hold .",
    "these transformations change the sign of the velocity and as a result it is possible to construct for every trajectory a mirror image with the opposite sign for the velocity . in this case , averaging over a representative set of trajectories yields zero mean velocity , i.e. a vanishing directed transport .",
    "such transformations reverse either time or spatial coordinates together with a constant shift .",
    "thus they take on the appearance @xmath19 the equations of motion belonging to the hamiltonian are simply given by @xmath20 for the absence of directed transport for symmetry reasons it is therefore necessary that the potential @xmath21 is invariant under one of the transformations .",
    "we remark that a vanishing current can also occur if the above symmetries do not hold , which is however a non - generic case and is encountered only for specifically chosen parameter values . in the case of the uniformly oscillating lattice @xmath22",
    "actually two such transformations can be identified .",
    "@xmath23 consequently , for the uniformly oscillating lattice no directed transport will occur .",
    "the same is true , if the local phase shifts of the barriers alternate , i.e. @xmath24 in this case the transformation is given by @xmath25 in order to reduce the number of varying parameters , we set the frequency and the amplitude of the driving laws to @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , the barriers width and the equilibrium distance are fixed to @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "finally , without loss of generality the mass of the particles is chosen @xmath30 .",
    "we therefore remain with two parameters : the barrier height @xmath1 and the local phase shifts @xmath17 .",
    "since our major interest are the lattice s transport properties , we focus on setups , for which the symmetries are broken .",
    "this is implemented by spatially modulating the phase shifts @xmath17 of the driving laws . in the following three different setups",
    "are studied in detail :    \\(a ) firstly , the potential height is fixed to @xmath31 and the sites are equipped by a linearly increasing phase , i.e. a _ constant phase gradient _ is chosen , @xmath32 where the periods of the site - dependent phases ( for reasons of brevity we call them `` phase periods '' ) are @xmath33 . for @xmath34 ,",
    "the sequence of phase shifts @xmath17 is @xmath35 , whereas for @xmath36 a lattice of uniformly oscillating barriers is recovered .",
    "one can verify straightforwardly that it is not possible to define proper @xmath37 and @xmath38 , such that the potential is invariant under one of the transformations for phase periods greater than or equal to three .",
    "hence a nonzero mean velocity could be expected for @xmath39 .",
    "\\(b ) for the second class of setups we keep @xmath31 and the above phase gradient with period three setup is perturbed ( _ perturbed phase gradient _ ) , i.e. the sequence of phase shifts becomes @xmath40 such that for @xmath41 the equidistant phase gradient is recovered .",
    "\\(c ) a specific phase period three @xmath42 is chosen and the global potential height @xmath1 is varied ( _ broken phase gradient _ ) .",
    "this section is devoted to the analysis of the phase space of the hamiltonian for the above - provided setups .",
    "general characteristics of the pss , like the appearance of regular islands and the chaotic sea , are discussed .",
    "especially , main emphasis is placed on the comparison of the phase space properties of the uniformly oscillating lattice @xmath36 ( global driving , @xmath36 ) and the setups with spatial phase modulation ( local driving , @xmath43 ) .",
    "furthermore , the stability of the phase space structures against perturbation of the phase pattern is studied .",
    "( color online ) stroboscopic pss of the lattice of uniformly oscillating square potentials . for a better illustration",
    "we have added in ( a ) the potential energy to the kinetic energy of the particles , in order to avoid the discontinuities in the `` regular '' pss ( see ( b ) ) . ]      in this section the phase space in the case of global harmonic driving is analyzed .",
    "firstly , the method , how the poincar surfaces of section for this and all the upcoming setups are obtained , is described briefly .",
    "afterwards , the phase space is discussed and a kinematic approach to determine the border of the chaotic sea is presented . finally , the flux through cantori and the transit time of trajectories is determined .",
    "since the particles move at constant velocity between collisions with the barriers edges , the hamiltonian flow can be described by an implicit two - dimensional map ( for details see @xcite ) . to visualize the dynamics",
    ", we make poincar surface of sections ( pss ) of the phase space .",
    "due to the time - periodicity of the hamiltonian @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , an area - preserving surface of section is obtained by taking stroboscopic `` snapshots '' of the @xmath46-plane at times @xmath47 with @xmath48 . additionally , the hamiltonian possesses the translation invariance @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the length of the system s unit cell .",
    "generally , @xmath50 is not the distance between the barriers at their equilibrium positions , but for our chosen setups @xmath50 is a multiple of @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the phase period .",
    "thereby , the space coordinate can be restricted to the length @xmath50 of the hamiltonian s unit cell .",
    "the desired poincar surface of section is then provided by the set of points @xmath54 obviously , since the time between successive `` snapshots '' of the @xmath46-plane is equal , the pss is done for a specific phase of the driving .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the appearance of the surface of section is not universal but depends on exactly this phase .",
    "an example of how this manifests itself in the pss is given after the next paragraph .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ( b ) the pss of the lattice with a phase period one , i.e. a lattice of uniformly oscillating barriers ( @xmath36,@xmath50=@xmath51 ) is shown .",
    "this poincar surface of section possesses discontinuities ( dashed box in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ( b ) ) , which are due to the fact that the particles are either inside or outside the barrier when the snapshot of the @xmath46-plane is taken .",
    "the particles outside have @xmath55 and accordingly @xmath56 inside .",
    "since the potential is not smooth , this provides discontinuities in the pss . for illustrative reasons it is therefore useful to add for those particles , which are at the moment of the snapshot inside the barrier , the potential energy @xmath56 to the kinetic energy",
    "this has been done in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ( a ) .",
    "the invariant curves are then continuous , yet the barrier can be seen as a blank squared region in the pss .",
    "nevertheless , to avoid the discontinuities all the subsequent pss are presented in this way .",
    "another eye - catching feature of the pss is reflection symmetry with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "however , this is not universally valid , but it occurs only for specific phases of the snapshot of the @xmath46-plane . as fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ( a ) shows , the pss is done at the moment the barrier arrives at one of its turning points , i.e. the _",
    "i_-th barrier is centered around @xmath57 at this time instant .",

    "fig : fig2 ] ( a ) ) . if the pss is made for instance",
    "when the barrier has its maximum velocity , then this symmetry is absent .",

    "the integrable dynamics of a free particle is recovered and the phase space is foliated by invariant curves , which are topologically equivalent to a torus . in the pss",
    "these curves appear as straight lines , which stretch out over the whole unit cell .",
    "this simple part of the pss is not displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ( a ) and occurs for @xmath63 . with decreasing momentum ,",
    "the integrability is lost , but large regular domains remain .",
    "many orbits still lie on deformed tori , which occur as curved lines in the pss ( @xmath64 in fig . [",
    "fig : fig2 ] ( a ) ) . particles on these invariant curves travel through the lattice in the direction of their initial momentum .",
    "indeed the kam theorem predicts that tori with sufficiently irrational winding number survive under a small perturbation .",
    "the winding number is defined as the limit @xmath65 if it exists .",
    "@xmath66 and @xmath67 are measured in multiples of the spatial period of the unit cell and time period , respectively .",
    "thus @xmath68 is proportional to the average velocity of the particle in the lattice @xmath69 .",
    "tori with rational winding numbers @xmath70 are excluded in the kam theorem . according to the poincar - birkhoff theorem they dissolve into an even number of alternately elliptic and hyperbolic fixed points of period @xmath71 .",
    "the trajectories in the extended system , which correspond to these periodic orbits in the pss , travel @xmath72 spatial unit cells in @xmath71 time periods in the direction of their initial velocity .",
    "hence in the pss they occur as @xmath71 distinct points . around each elliptic periodic orbit there",
    "is again a set of invariant curves , which can be seen in our pss as elliptic islands .",
    "completely analogous to the trajectory belonging to the periodic orbit in the center of this structure , the motion of particles , which are inside these islands proceeds through the lattice only in one direction .",
    "accordingly , the trajectories intersect sequentially the pss at different islands of the corresponding chain of islands . in the vicinity of the hyperbolic fixed points",
    "there is an infinite number of homo- and heteroclinic intersections of the stable and unstable manifolds , which yields horseshoe type dynamics and hence the presence of chaos . for large kinetic energies these chaotic layers are too small to be visible in the pss .",
    "the magnification of the pss ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fig2b ] ) for @xmath73 shows such a separatrix region around @xmath74 .",
    "however , with decreasing momentum the strength of the perturbation and thereby the size of these layers increases until finally a large chaotic sea in the pss for small momenta develops .",
    "trajectories , belonging to this chaotic sea in the pss , wander diffusively through the lattice .    at @xmath0",
    ", there is an elliptic island , which has been discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to trapped motion in the scattering region of a single barrier .",
    "moreover , this island exists only for a certain regime of the parameters @xmath75 . due to the point - like interaction between the barrier and the particles it is possible to determine analytically @xcite the position of these resonances in the pss by exploiting the symmetry properties of the corresponding central periodic orbit .",
    "other dominant elliptic islands in the pss are the ones with winding number @xmath76 , i.e. the central periodic orbits are trajectories , which travel @xmath72 lattice sites during one oscillation period of the lattice .",
    "[ fig : traj ] ( a ) shows the trajectory , which corresponds to the central periodic orbit of the @xmath77 resonance at @xmath78 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ( a ) , together with the two barriers in position space .",
    "obviously the phases belonging to the four collisions are symmetric with respect to @xmath79 , ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) , such that the velocity @xmath82 after transmission through the two barriers equals the initial velocity @xmath83 . in the appendix [ ap : po_few ] a method to determine the positions of periodic orbits with few collisions in the pss is described using the example of this @xmath61-orbit .",
    "( color online ) magnification of the poincar surface of section in the region of the upper boundary of the chaotic sea .",
    "the dashed curve is the last stable kam torus , i.e. this invariant curve delimits the chaotic sea . ]",
    "let us now discuss the border regions of the pss ( @xmath84 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ( a ) ) , where the large chaotic sea is bounded by tori , which have not been destroyed by the perturbation , i.e. the driving . in this regime of intermediate kinetic energy",
    "more chains of elliptic islands are visible in the pss . for even larger momenta the chaotic sea is bounded by an invariant curve , which is called the `` first invariant spanning curve '' ( fisc ) .",
    "[ fig : fig2b ] shows a magnification of this region of the pss for positive momenta with the fisc shown as a dashed line . for negative momenta there",
    "exists of course a fisc , too ( fig . [",
    "fig : fig2 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "although the position of the fisc in the pss is very hard to be determined analytically , one can derive at least an approximation to its position in velocity space .",
    "we recall that particles on the fisc are fast enough to be transmitted , even if a collision takes place when the barrier moves with its extremal velocity @xmath85 in the same direction , i.e. the minimal relative kinetic energy must exceed the potential height .",
    "thus we get @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the velocity of the particle . in case of a harmonic driving law ,",
    "the extremal velocities of the barrier are given by @xmath88 .",
    "plugging @xmath89 in equation yields an approximation to the velocity regime where the fisc is located in the pss . depending on the sign of @xmath87 we find @xmath90 where the index @xmath91 denotes the position of the fisc in the pss for positive and negative velocities , respectively .",
    "in case of the harmonic driving law we have @xmath92 independent of the phase period . for @xmath30 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath31",
    ", we find from equation @xmath93 .",
    "[ fig : fig2b ] shows that the fisc of the uniformly oscillating lattice is located indeed at @xmath94 .",
    "this discrepancy is significant ( around 15 % ) , which is due to the fact that this approximation accounts only for a simple kinematic consideration of the dynamics between the particle and a single barrier and neglects all the dynamical processes happening in the extended system .",
    "nevertheless , this naive approach provides some insights , as we shall argue briefly in the following . for driving laws with more than one frequency , which have been used for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite , the extremal velocity @xmath89 of the barrier depends on its sign . for example , in the case of the biharmonic driving law @xmath95 one finds @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively . in this case equation yields @xmath98 and @xmath99 . consequently , we expect that the fisc for positive momenta is located closer to @xmath0 than for negative momenta independently of the phase of the pss . indeed in ref .",
    "@xcite a similar behavior has been observed .",

    "let us now turn to the discussion of the transit times of orbits in the pss .",
    "first of all we give an example of trajectories in the chaotic sea , which are confined to a subpart of phase space for a very long time .",
    "then a procedure how to approximate the average escape time from this region is described briefly .",
