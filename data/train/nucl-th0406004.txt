    "together , these properties of solid oxygen suggest that a hundredfold increase in the ucn flux relative to what is available from solid deuterium should be possible , given the same incident neutron flux . the optimal operational temperature is 2 k , somewhat lower than that of solid deuterium ( 5 k )",
