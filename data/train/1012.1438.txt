    "h1 and zeus have combined various sub - sets of their data .",
    "the combination of inclusive cross section data from hera - i and the pdf fit based on these data are already published  @xcite . in 2010 further data have been combined and pdf fits to the augmented data sets have been made available in preliminary form . in sec .",
    "[ sec : inc1 ] results from the published combination are reviewed . in sec .",
    "[ sec : charm ] results from a combination of @xmath5 data are presented and their impact on predictions for @xmath1 and @xmath2 production at the lhc discussed . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lowenergy ] results from the combination of inclusive cross section data taken at lower proton beam energies are discussed . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : inc2 ] an updated combination of all inclusive data from hera - i and hera - ii running is shown and predictions for the lhc @xmath1 and lepton asymmetries , from a pdf fit to these data , are presented .",
    "the inclusive cross section data , from the hera - i running period 1992 - 2001 , for neutral current ( nc ) and charged current ( nc ) , @xmath6 and @xmath7 scattering have been combined  @xcite .",
    "the combination procedure pays particular attention to the correlated systematic uncertainties of the data sets such that resulting combined data benefits from the best features of each detector .",
    "the combined data set has systematic uncertainties which are smaller than its statistical errors and the total uncertainties are small ( @xmath8 ) over a large part of the kinematic plane .",
    "the combined data is compared to the separate input data sets of zeus and h1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : herapdf10 ] .",
    "these data are used as the sole input to a pdf fit called the herapdf1.0  @xcite .",
    "the motivations for performing a hera - only fit are firstly , that the combination of the hera data yields a very accurate and consistent data set such that the experimental uncertainties on the pdfs may be estimated from the conventional @xmath9 criterion @xmath10 . global fits which include dats sets from many different experiments often use inflated @xmath9 tolerances in order to account for marginal consistency of the input data sets .",
    "secondly , the hera data are proton target data so that there is no uncertainty from heavy target corrections or deuterium corrections and there is no need to assume that @xmath11 in the proton is the same as @xmath12 in the neutron since the @xmath11-quark pdf may be extracted from @xmath6 cc data .",
    "thirdly , the hera inclusive data give information on the gluon , the sea and the @xmath12- and @xmath11-valence pdfs over a wide kinematic region : the low-@xmath13 nc @xmath6 cross - section data are closely related to the low-@xmath0 sea pdf and the low-@xmath0 gluon pdf is derived from its scaling violations ; the high-@xmath0 @xmath14 and @xmath11-valence pdfs are closely related to the high-@xmath13 nc @xmath15,cc @xmath7 and cc @xmath6 cross sections , respectively ; the difference between the high-@xmath13 @xmath7 and @xmath6 cross - sections gives the valence shapes down to low @xmath0 , @xmath16 .",
