    "solar energetic particles ( seps ) are high energy particles associated with explosive phenomena occurring in the solar atmosphere , such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) .",
    "they can significantly perturb the earth s magnetosphere producing a sudden increase in particle fluxes and , consequently , in the radiation exposure experienced by spacecrafts and their possible crew .",
    "seps constitute a sample of solar material and provide important information about the sources of the particle populations , and their angular distribution can be used to investigate details of the particle transport in the interplanetary medium .",
    "sep measurements are performed both by in - situ detectors on spacecrafts and by ground - based neutron monitors ( nms ) . while the former are able to measure seps with energies below some tens of mev , the latter can only register the highest energy seps ( @xmath1 1 gev ) during the so - called ground level enhancements ( gles ) .",
    "a large energy gap exists between the two groups of observations .",
    "new accurate measurements of seps are being provided by the pamela experiment @xcite . in particular , the instrument is able to detect seps in a wide energy interval ranging from @xmath080 mev up to several gev , hence bridging the low energy data by space - based instruments and the gle data by the worldwide network of nms . in addition , pamela is sensitive to the particle composition and it is able to reconstruct the flux angular distribution , thus enabling a clearer and more complete view of the sep events .",
    "this paper reports the analysis methods developed for the estimate of sep energy spectra with the pamela apparatus , as a function of the particle asymptotic direction of arrival . as case study ,",
    "the results used in the analysis of the may 17 , 2012 solar event @xcite are presented .",
    "pamela is a space - based experiment designed for a precise measurement of the charged cosmic radiation in the kinetic energy range from some tens of mev up to several hundreds of gev @xcite .",
    "the resurs - dk1 satellite , which hosts the apparatus , was launched into a semi - polar ( 70 deg inclination ) and elliptical ( 350610 km altitude ) orbit on june the 15@xmath2 2006 . in 2010",
    "it was changed to an approximately circular orbit at an altitude of about 580 km .",
    "the spacecraft is 3-axis stabilized ; its orientation is calculated by an onboard processor with an accuracy better than 1 deg .",
    "particle directions are measured with a high angular resolution ( @xmath3 2 deg ) .",
    "details about apparatus performance , proton selection , detector efficiencies and measurement uncertainties can be found elsewhere ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis of sep events described in this work relies on the igrf-11 @xcite and the ts07d @xcite models for the description of the internal and external geomagnetic field , respectively : the former employs a global spherical harmonic implementation of the main magnetic field ; the latter is a high resolution dynamical model of the storm - time geomagnetic field in the inner magnetosphere , based on recent satellite measurements .",
    "consistent with the dataset coverage , the model is valid within the region delimited by the magnetopause ( based on @xcite ) and by a spherical surface with a radius of 30 earth s radii ( re ) .",
    "solar wind ( sw ) and imf parameters are obtained from the high resolution ( 5-min ) omniweb database @xcite .",
    "the ts07d model is more flexible and accurate with respect to all past empirical models in reconstructing the distribution of storm - scale currents , so it is particularly adequate for the study of sep events .",
    "cosmic ray ( cr ) cutoff rigidities and asymptotic arrival directions ( i.e. the directions of approach before encountering the earth s magnetosphere ) are commonly evaluated by simulations , accounting for the effect of the geomagnetic field on the particle transport ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein )",
    ". using spacecraft ephemeris data ( position , orientation , time ) , and the particle rigidity ( @xmath4 = momentum / charge ) and direction provided by the tracking system , trajectories of all detected protons are reconstructed by means of a tracing program based on numerical integration methods @xcite , and implementing the afore - mentioned geomagnetic field models .    to reduce the computational time , geomagnetically trapped @xcite and most albedo @xcite particles ( originated from the interactions of crs with the earth s atmosphere )",
    "are discarded by selecting only protons with rigidities @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 gv , where @xmath7 is the mcilwain s parameter @xcite .",
    "then , each trajectory is back propagated from the measurement location and traced , with no constraint limiting the total path - length or tracing time , until one of the two following conditions is satisfied :    1 .",
    "it reaches the model magnetosphere boundaries ( see section [ geomagnetic field models ] ) ; 2 .   or it reaches an altitude of 40 km .",
    "the two categories correspond to `` allowed '' and `` forbidden '' trajectories , respectively : the former includes contributions from solar and galactic crs ( hereafter scrs and gcrs ) , while events satisfying the latter condition , including albedo particles with rigidities greater than @xmath8 , are excluded from the analysis",
    ".     are also shown ( color coding ) for the x - y ( top ) , the x - z ( middle ) and the y - z ( bottom ) gse planes .",
    "see the text for details.,width=268 ]",
    "the asymptotic arrival directions are evaluated with respect to the imf direction , with polar angles @xmath9 and @xmath10 denoting the particle pitch and gyro - phase angle , respectively .",
    "both geographic ( geo ) and geocentric solar ecliptic ( gse ) coordinates are used .",
    "figure [ magnetotraj ] reports some sample trajectories reconstructed in the gse coordinate system .",
    "the total magnetic field intensities obtained with the igrf-11 + ts07d models ( @xmath11 30 @xmath12 ) are also shown ( color coding ) for the x - y ( top ) , the x - z ( middle ) and the y - z ( bottom ) gse planes .",
    "the crosses denote the estimated position of the bow shock nose @xcite .",
    "the trajectory analysis allows a deeper understanding of sep events . to improve the interpretation of results",
    ", the directions of approach and the entry points at the model magnetosphere boundaries can be visualized as a function of particle rigidity and orbital position @xcite . as an example , figure [ 17may2012 ] reports the proton results ( @xmath4 @xmath3 3 gv ) for the may 17 , 2012 sep event @xcite , associated with the first gle of the 24@xmath13 solar cycle .",
    "only the first pamela polar pass which registered the event is included , corresponding to the interval 01:57 ",
    "02:20 ut .    left panels show the reconstructed asymptotic directions for the selected proton sample ( counts ) in terms of geo ( top and middle ) and gse ( bottom ) coordinates ; in the top panel colors denote the number of proton counts in each bin , while in middle and bottom panels they refer to the particle rigidity .",
    "distributions are integrated over the polar pass .",
    "the spacecraft position is indicated by the grey curve .",
    "the contour curves represent values of constant pitch angle with respect to the imf direction , denoted with crosses . as pamela is moving ( eastward ) and changing its orientation along the orbit , observed asymptotic directions rapidly vary performing a ( clockwise ) loop over the region above brazil ( see middle panel ) .",
    "right panels in the same figure display the distributions of asymptotic directions as a function of ut , and particle rigidity ( top and middle ) and pitch - angle ( bottom ) ; colors in the top panel denote the number of proton counts in each bin while , in middle and bottom panel , they correspond to particle pitch - angle and rigidity respectively .",
    "solid curves denote the estimated strmer vertical cutoff @xcite for the pamela epoch ( @xmath14 gv ) .",
    "since pamela aperture is about 20 deg , the observable pitch - angle range at a given rigidity is quite small ( a few deg ) except in the penumbral regions around the local geomagnetic cutoff , where particle trajectories become complex ( chaotic trajectories ) and both allowed and forbidden bands of cr trajectories are present @xcite .",
    "corresponding asymptotic directions rapidly change with particle rigidity and looking direction .",
    "conservatively , these regions are excluded from the analysis .",
    "the factor of proportionality between fluxes and counting rates , corrected for selection efficiencies , is by definition the gathering power @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) of the apparatus : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the solid angle domain limited by the instrument geometry , @xmath19 is the detector surface area , * * @xmath20**d*@xmath21 * is the effective element of area looking into @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the flux angular distribution ( varying between 0 and 1 ) and @xmath24 is the directional response function @xcite .    in the case of the pamela instrument",
    ", @xmath15 is rigidity dependent due to the spectrometer bending effect on particle trajectories : it decreases with decreasing rigidity @xmath4 since particles with lower rigidity are more and more deflected by the magnetic field toward the lateral walls of the magnetic cavity , being absorbed before reaching the lowest plane of the time of flight system , which provides the event trigger ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .        in terms of the zenith @xmath25 and the azimuth @xmath26 angles describing downward - going particle directions in the pamela frame : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the apparatus response function in units of area ( @xmath29 ) , and the @xmath30 factor accounts for the trajectory inclination with respect to the instrument axis .    for non - ideal detectors",
    ", it is necessary to account for the effect of elastic and inelastic particle interactions inside the apparatus ( especially with its mechanical parts ) , on the measured coincidence rate .",
    "consequently , @xmath15 is different for each particle species ( protons , electrons , ions , etc . ) .      for an isotropic particle flux ,",
    "the gathering power does not depend on looking direction ( i.e. @xmath23 = 1 ) , and it is usually called the geometrical factor @xmath31 .      a technically simple but efficient solution for the calculation of the geometrical factor of the apparatus is provided by monte carlo methods @xcite .",
    "the solid angle is subdivided into a large number of ( @xmath32 ) bins , with the angular domain limited to downward - going directions .",
    "for each bin :    * particles are produced with random position on a plane generation surface with area @xmath33 , placed just above the apparatus opening aperture , so that a large number of events corresponds to the intensity incident on the instrument .",
    "* for each particle , a random ( i.e. random @xmath34 and @xmath26 ) direction is chosen in the selected ( @xmath32 ) bin .",
    "* trajectories are propagated through the apparatus and tested at successively deeper layers : only particles satisfying all the detector geometrical constraints defining the apparatus field of view ( fov ) are selected .",
    "the procedure is repeated until the desired statistical precision ( see below ) is achieved .",
    "then , for each rigidity value , the geometrical factor is obtained as : @xmath35 with @xmath36where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the numbers of selected and generated trajectories in each angular bin , and the @xmath34 factor accounts for the probability of a particle trajectory with direction ( @xmath39 ) : @xmath40 the statistical uncertainty on @xmath41 can be evaluated with binomial methods : @xmath42   cos^{2}\\theta}.\\ ] ] advantage is taken of the angular subdivision , by varying directions over the @xmath43 solid angle rather than a full @xmath44 hemisphere . in particular , a number @xmath38 of incident trajectories proportional to @xmath45 ( with @xmath46 taken at @xmath47 bin center ) is chosen in order to minimize the statistical error associated to the angular bins with a small @xmath48 .",
    "ratio ( color codes ) over the pamela field of view , as a function of local polar coordinates @xmath26 and @xmath34 ( apparatus reference frame ) .",
    "results for 0.39 gv ( top ) and 4.09 gv ( bottom ) protons are displayed .",
    "see the text for details.,title=\"fig:\",width=432 ] +    ratio ( color codes ) over the pamela field of view , as a function of local polar coordinates @xmath26 and @xmath34 ( apparatus reference frame ) .",
    "results for 0.39 gv ( top ) and 4.09 gv ( bottom ) protons are displayed .",
    "see the text for details.,title=\"fig:\",width=432 ]    the dependence of the instrument response on particle rigidity is studied by performing the calculation for 30 rigidities in the range 0.3910 gv , and the value of @xmath41 at intermediate @xmath4 is evaluated through interpolation methods .",
    "an accurate estimate of the pamela geometrical factor based on the monte carlo approach can be found in @xcite .    as an example , figure [ acce78 ] reports the @xmath48 ratio ( color codes ) over the pamela fov as a function of local @xmath26 and @xmath34 , for 0.39 gv ( top panel ) and 4.09 gv ( bottom panel ) protons .",
    "the four peaks structure reflects the rectangular section of the apparatus ; the differences in the fov distributions at different rigidities are due to the bending effect of the magnetic spectrometer .",
    "however , in presence of an anisotropic flux exposition ( @xmath49 ) , the gathering power depends also on the flux angular distribution .",
    "scr fluxes can be conveniently expressed in terms of asymptotic polar angles @xmath9 ( pitch angle ) and @xmath10 ( gyro - phase angle ) with respect to the imf direction : @xmath50 .",
    "the corresponding gathering power can be written as : @xmath51 with @xmath25=@xmath52 and @xmath26=@xmath53 .",
    "the flux angular distribution @xmath54 is unknown .      for simplicity",
    ", we assume that scr fluxes depend only on particle rigidity @xmath4 and asymptotic pitch angle @xmath9 , estimating an apparatus effective area ( @xmath55 ) as : @xmath56 by averaging the directional response function over the @xmath10 angle .",
    "the method is valid also for isotropic fluxes ( independent on @xmath9 ) : in this case , the effective area is related to the geometrical factor @xmath41 by : @xmath57    the approach is analogous to the one developed for the measurement of geomagnetically trapped protons @xcite , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 denoting the polar angles with respect to the local geomagnetic field direction .",
    "but while local angles can be calculated from @xmath58 by means of basic rotation matrices of the fov involving only the spacecraft orientation with respect to the local magnetic field , the conversion to asymptotic angles depends on the particle propagation in the magnetosphere , so trajectory tracing methods are needed .",
    "the effective area definition given in equation [ gathering_power_formula5 ] is based on the assumption of approximately isotropic fluxes within small pitch - angle bins .",
    "consequently , @xmath59 can be derived from equation [ differential_gf_tot ] by integrating the directional response function over the ( @xmath39 ) directions corresponding to pitch angles within the interval @xmath60 : @xmath61 the approach accuracy depends on the number of ( @xmath32 ) bins used in the angular partitioning ( see section [ monte carlo integration methods ] ) , while the width of the @xmath62 bins is chosen accounting for the detector angular resolution .",
    "but for 4.09 gv protons.,width=480 ]    to convert local ( @xmath39 ) into asymptotic ( @xmath63 ) directions and apply equation [ mcgfactor_alpha ] , a large number of trajectories @xmath64 , uniformly distributed inside pamela field of view , has to be reconstructed in the magnetosphere , for each rigidity value and each orbital position . in order to assure a high resolution ,",
    "the calculation is performed for time steps with a 1-sec width , back - tracing about 2800 trajectories for each rigidity bin , for a total of more than @xmath65 trajectories for each polar pass ( @xmath0 23 min ) . at a later stage ,",
    "results are extended over the full field of view of pamela through a bilinear interpolation .",
    "the procedure is illustrated in figures [ area600_ek78]-[area600_ek1582 ] for 0.39 and 4.09 gv protons respectively , at a sample orbital position ( may 17 , 2012 , 02:07 ut ) .",
    "top panels report the distribution of reconstructed directions in the pamela field of view , with each point associated to a given asymptotic direction ( @xmath9,@xmath10 ) ; middle panels show the calculated ( after interpolation ) pitch - angle coverage calculation can be neglected under the gyro - tropic approximation . ] ; bottom panels illustrate the estimated effective area as a function of the explored pitch - angle range .",
    "final calculation results for 22 rigidity values between 0.39 and 4.09 gv ( see the color code ) are displayed in figure [ all600 ] : the peaks in the distributions correspond to vertically incident protons .",
    "figure [ acce_cones2012 ] reports the asymptotic cones of acceptance of the pamela apparatus evaluated for the first polar pass ( 01:5702:20 ut ) during the may 17 , 2012 sep event @xcite .",
    "results for sample rigidity values ( see the color code ) are shown as a function of geo ( top panel ) and gse ( middle panel ) coordinates ; grey points denote the spacecraft position , while crosses indicate the imf direction . the pitch - angle coverage as a function of orbital position",
    "is shown in the bottom panel . while moving ( and rotating ) along the orbit , pamela covers a large pitch - angle interval , approximately ranging from 0 to 145 deg .",
    "in particular , pamela is looking at the imf direction between 02:14 and 02:18 ut , depending on the proton rigidity .",
    "differential directional fluxes are obtained at each orbital position @xmath66 as : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the number of proton counts in the bin @xmath69 , corrected by the selection efficiencies , and the denominator represents the asymptotic exposition of the apparatus integrated over the selected rigidity bin @xmath70 .",
    "averaged fluxes over the polar pass @xmath71 are evaluated as : @xmath72 where @xmath73 and the exposition is derived by weighting each effective area contribution by the corresponding lifetime spent by pamela at the same orbital position .",
    "since it is not possible to discriminate between scr and gcr signals , solar flux intensities are obtained by subtracting the gcr contribution from the total measured flux .",
    "the gcr component is evaluated by estimating proton fluxes during two days prior the arrival of seps .",
    "we found that the gcr flux is isotropic with respect to the imf direction within experimental uncertainties .",
    "consequently , the same flux @xmath74 is subtracted for all pitch angle bins : @xmath75      flux statistical errors can be obtained by evaluating 68.27% c.l .",
    "intervals for a poissonian signal @xmath76 in presence of a background @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "systematic uncertainties related to the reconstruction of asymptotic directions are evaluated by introducing a bias in the particle direction measurement from the tracking system , according to a gaussian distribution with a variance equal to the experimental angular resolution .",
    "this paper reports the analysis methods developed for the estimate of sep energy spectra as a function of the particle asymptotic direction of arrival .",
    "the exposition of the pamela apparatus is evaluated by means of accurate back - tracing simulations based on a realistic description of the earth s magnetosphere . as case study ,",
    "the results of the calculation for the may 17 , 2012 event are discussed .",
    "the developed trajectory analysis enables the investigation of flux anisotropies , providing fundamental information for the characterization of seps .",
