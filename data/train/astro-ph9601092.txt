    "the existence of massive black hole ( bh ) binaries follows from two widely - accepted assumptions : that galaxies merge with other galaxies , and that many galaxies contain massive bhs .",
    "for if two bhs enter the core of a merged galaxy , dynamical friction drags them to the center where they form a binary .",
    "the subsequent evolution was first outlined by begelman , blandford , and rees ( 1980 , hereafter bbr ) .",
    "initially the binary hardens ( i.e.  its separation shrinks ) because of the interaction between the bhs and all the stars in the galaxy core .",
    "but that is ineffective once the bhs become close because distant stars perturb the binary s center of mass but not its semimajor axis .",
    "the binary then hardens by giving kinetic energy to stars that pass in its immediate vicinity ; a hard binary can eject stars out of the core at high velocity .",
    "if there are enough stars for the hardening to continue ( and gas accretion onto the bhs can help ) , eventually the bhs merge through the emission of gravitational radiation ; otherwise the hardening stalls and the binary survives for the lifetime of the galaxy .    whether a binary merges or survives and how long it spends in each stage of the evolution are questions relevant to a number of problems in extragalactic astronomy .",
    "their answers would help us predict the total bh merger rate and whether it is high enough for us to detect the resulting gravitational waves ( e.g.  thorne 1992 , haehnelt 1994 ) .",
    "they would help us assess bh - binary models for the bending and apparent precession of radio jets from active galactic nuclei , first proposed by bbr . and they would tell us what to expect if three or more bhs enter the core of a galaxy , which can happen if the bhs are dragged in from the galaxy s halo or if the galaxy undergoes multiple mergers with other galaxies containing bhs .",
    "if the first binary merges fast it can form a binary with a third bh , and once that merges it can form a binary with a fourth , and so on , leading to a massive central bh ; but if the first binary still exists when a third bh enters then one or all three of the bhs can be ejected in a sling - shot interaction .",
    "arguments like these can set limits on massive bhs as dark - matter candidates for galactic halos ( see hut and rees 1992 , xu and ostriker 1994 for conflicting limits for our galaxy ) .",
    "another question is what a binary merger does to the surrounding galaxy , i.e.  what observable signature it leaves .",
    "mass ejection during the evolution should reduce a galaxy s central density and expand its core ( bbr ) .",
    "ebisuzaki , makino , and okumura ( 1991 ) have proposed this as an explanation for why large elliptical galaxies have lower central densities and weaker density cusps than small ellipticals ( e.g.  kormendy et al.1994 ) .",
    "we are far from having precise answers to any of these questions .",
    "bbr gave a range of merger times for one typical example that spanned three orders of magnitude because of the uncertain influence that mass ejection has on the hardening rate .",
    "fukushige , ebisuzaki and makino ( 1992 ) have argued that dynamical friction causes a binary to become highly eccentric and that this greatly reduces the merger time because gravitational radiation then becomes important early in the evolution .",
    "although their arguments are not convincing , they have called attention to the eccentricity growth and our ignorance of its correct description . there are uncertainties in how the hardening rate depends on the ratio of the two bh masses , in when a binary makes the transition from soft to hard , and even in what the words soft and hard should mean in this context . and our knowledge of how a binary merger changes a galaxy is based on back - of - the - envelope estimates and simple n - body experiments with unrealistic galaxy models .",
    "the first step towards resolving these questions is to understand how a massive binary evolves in fixed stellar background .",
    "consider a binary with masses @xmath0 and semimajor axis @xmath2 in an isotropic background of stars of mass @xmath3 , density @xmath4 , and one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath5 ; let @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the total and reduced binary mass : @xmath8 the binary evolution and its effect on the galaxy are determined by three dimensionless quantities : the hardening rate @xmath9 the mass ejection rate ( where @xmath10 is the stellar mass that the binary has ejected from the galaxy core ) @xmath11 and the eccentricity growth rate @xmath12 the quantities @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 can be found from scattering experiments that treat the star - binary encounters one at a time .",
    "analytic approximations such as the impulse approximation are helpful during the early stages of the evolution ( gould 1991 ) , but not once the binary becomes hard .",
    "most published scattering experiments assume the binaries and stars to have equal or nearly equal masses ( see heggie 1988 for a review ) .",
    "there are some exceptions .",
    "roos ( 1981 ) performed scattering experiments for the restricted three - body problem to study the evolution of hard , massive bh binaries , and used them to correct a misplaced factor of @xmath16 in the bbr hardening rate .",
    "he tried to measure @xmath15 but his statistics were too poor to give definite conclusions ( only 500 orbits per measurement ) .",
    "hills ( 1983a ) used the general three - body problem to study interactions between a massive binary and low - mass intruders ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "he gave results for the hardening rate for a wide range of mass ratios ( @xmath18  300 ) , but like roos he considered only very hard binaries .",
    "mikkola and valtonen ( 1992 ) used the restricted three - body problem to measure @xmath13 and @xmath15 for equal - mass bh binaries with varying degrees of hardness .",
    "their measurements are accurate for hard binaries but have large error bars for binaries that are not hard .",
    "if @xmath19 then the interaction between a star and a bh binary is similar to the interaction between a comet and a planet orbiting a star .",
    "although scattering experiments are used to study cometary dynamics ( see fernandez 1993 for a review ) they are not of much help for our questions about bh binaries , partly because they often consider only one mass ratio ( for the sun - jupiter system ) , but mostly because they are used to answer different questions , such as the cross section for the capture of interstellar comets , or for the conversion of long - period comets to short - period comets , the survival probability of comets once they are captured , and how all these depend on the comet s inclination .",
    "there is nevertheless some overlap between the two problems .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present accurate measurements of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 over the range of parameters of interest for the bh - binary problem , including the dependence on the mass ratio , eccentricity , and degree of hardness of the binary",
    ". other quantities to be studied include the cross section for a binary to capture stars into bound orbits , for close encounters between stars and the binary members , and the distribution of velocities with which stars are expelled from the binary .",
    "these add to our understanding of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , and are needed by themselves for some applications .",
    "the results will be presented in a model - independent way so that they can be applied to any problem with @xmath20 .",
    "once @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 have been measured they can be used to study the evolution of binaries in fixed galaxy models .",
    "that will be done here for some simple models .",
    "if the bhs are large they will of course eject too much mass from the galaxy core for it to be considered fixed .",
    "but the results will still be valid during the early stages of the evolution . and",
    "they will be helpful even in the later stages , because we can imagine at any instant that the binary is embedded in a fixed background whose properties are those of the galaxy at that instant .",
    "the self - consistent evolution of a massive binary in a realistic galaxy model and the changes this induces in the model are best studied by large n - body experiments .",
    "that will be deferred to paper ii , along with a discussion of what both papers imply for the astronomical questions mentioned above ( quinlan and hernquist , in preparation ) .",
    "we treat the star as a massless test particle moving in the potential of the two bhs . from the changes in the star s energy and angular momentum per unit mass , @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    ", we infer the corresponding changes @xmath23 and @xmath24 that the binary would have suffered if the star had been given a small but nonzero mass .",
    "the three bodies are treated as point masses and gravitational radiation is ignored .    in a real galaxy stars",
    "approach the binary with a wide distribution of velocities at any given time .",
    "but the scattering experiments are easiest to perform if the stars all start from the same velocity @xmath25 at a large separation from the binary ( the initial velocity , or the velocity at infinity ) . in that case",
    "we write @xmath26 where the `` 1 '' indicates that the stars all have a single velocity @xmath25 .",
    "the hardening rate for a maxwellian velocity distribution is then @xmath27 where @xmath28    the hardening rate is derived from the average energy change for stars that scatter off the binary .",
    "we define a dimensionless energy change @xmath29 by ( hills 1983a ) @xmath30 this must be averaged over all angular variables describing the binary s orientation and phase , to give @xmath31 , and then integrated over all impact parameters .",
    "the averaging and integrating are done in a monte carlo fashion by picking orbits from suitable distributions .",
    "we sometimes describe an orbit by its impact parameter @xmath32 , the distance at which it would pass the binary if it felt no attraction , and sometimes by its pericenter distance @xmath33 , the distance if it is attracted by a point mass @xmath6 .",
    "the two are related by gravitational focusing : @xmath34 we also define a dimensionless impact parameter @xmath35 by @xmath36 @xmath37 is approximately the impact parameter corresponding to @xmath38 if gravitational focusing is important . with this notation",
    "we can write @xmath39 where the second equality defines the operator @xmath40 .",
    "the derivation of the eccentricity growth rate is similar .",
    "the change to the binary s eccentricity from a single scattering event is , if the change is small and the binary s orbital angular momentum points in the @xmath41 direction , @xmath42 .\\ ] ] we define a dimensionless angular - momentum change @xmath43 by @xmath44^{1/2 } } , \\ ] ] and can then write @xmath45 , \\ ] ] where the `` 1 '' has the same meaning as before .",
    "the derivation of @xmath15 from @xmath46 will be described later .",
    "each scattering experiment requires five uniformly - distributed random numbers ( four if the binary is circular ) : one for the square of the impact parameter ( in some range [ 0,@xmath47 ) , and four to fix the binary s orientation and phase : the cosine of the inclination ( [ -1,1 ] ) , the longitude of ascending node ( [ 0,@xmath48 ) , the argument of pericenter ( [ 0,@xmath48 ) , and the mean anomaly at some fixed time ( [ 0,@xmath48 ) .",
    "the numbers are chosen with the quasi - random number generator sobseq of press et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .",
    "the range [ 0,@xmath49 for impact parameters is split into five intervals corresponding to ranges in scaled pericenter distance @xmath50 of [ 0,1 ] , [ 1,2 ] , [ 2,4 ] , [ 4,8 ] , and [ 8,16 ] .",
    "each output quantity is measured in a number of steps . on the first step the program spends short but equal amounts of cpu time picking orbits from the five intervals . on each successive step",
    "the program doubles the cpu time and adjusts its strategy so that the time it spends on each interval is proportional to the uncertainty that interval contributes to the quantity being measured .",
    "once the uncertainty is reduced to an acceptable level , or the cpu time exceeds some maximum allowed value , the results from all five intervals are combined with appropriate weights for a distribution uniform in @xmath51 . for @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15",
    "the last three intervals contribute little because the changes in energy and angular momentum fall off rapidly with increasing impact parameter .",
    "the coordinates are chosen so that the binary s center of mass is at the origin and the star starts at infinity with @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the star is moved from @xmath54 to @xmath55 along a keplerian orbit about a point mass @xmath6 at the origin .",
    "the numerical integration starts at @xmath55 .",
    "the orbits are integrated in double precision with an explicit , embedded runge - kutta method of order ( 7)8 : the program dopri8 of hairer , norsett , and wanner ( 1987 ) .",
    "the program adjusts the integration stepsize to keep the fractional error per step in the position and velocity below some level @xmath56 , which was set to @xmath57 . with this choice the change in a star s jacobi constant for a circular binary is at most @xmath58 and often much smaller .",
    "the forces from the bhs are not softened .",
    "some integrations are time consuming because the star gets captured into a weakly - bound orbit and makes many revolutions before it is expelled .",
    "the integration stepsize is a small fraction of the binary s period even if the period of the star about the binary is much longer .",
    "the following approximation expedites those experiments .",
    "if a captured star moves further than @xmath59 from the binary , the binary is replaced by a point mass @xmath6 and the star is moved along a keplerian ellipse until it returns inside @xmath60 , when the forces from the bhs are reintroduced with the correct orbital phase .",
    "the @xmath61 mass scaling makes the quadrupole force from the binary at @xmath60 about @xmath62 , independent of @xmath63 .",
    "orbits that get captured for long times tend to be highly chaotic .",
    "the integration for any particular orbit of that type is difficult to justify because a small change to the integration procedure can make a big change to the outcome .",
    "but the average results derived from a large number of integrations can be correct even if the individual integrations are not ; that is suggested by shadowing lemmas that have been proved for simple chaotic systems .",
    "the average results presented here do not change noticeably if @xmath56 is raised or lowered by a factor of 100 , even though some orbits undergo big changes .",
    "an integration is stopped when the star leaves the sphere @xmath55 with positive energy .",
    "the average results are not sensitive to the location of this sphere provided that it is at least 1015 times larger than @xmath2 .",
    "once the integration stops the program records the changes to the star s energy and angular momentum , the minimum separations between the star and the two bhs , and between the star and the binary s center of mass , the integration time , the number of integration steps , and the number of times the star s radius passed through a minimum ( which , if greater than one , gives the number of revolutions that a captured orbit made ) .",
    "an orbit that does not get captured typically takes a few hundred to a few thousand integration steps .",
    "captured orbits can take much longer . if an integration lasts for more than @xmath64 steps it is abandoned .",
    "the fraction of abandoned integrations is the largest for hard binaries with @xmath65 , but even for those it is less than 0.1% .",
    "the error in any average quantity has a systematic component and a statistical component .",
    "systematic errors arise , for example , because of errors in the numerical integration , because integrations are abandoned if they take too long , because the program imposes a maximum impact parameter @xmath66 , and because the orbits start and end at @xmath55 instead of at @xmath54 . but",
    "none of these is large : the total systematic error is usually much smaller than the statistical error .",
    "the statistical errors are estimated by taking the difference between results found with @xmath67 orbits ( the final number ) and @xmath68 orbits , or sometimes  if that difference looks suspiciously small  one half the difference between @xmath67 orbits and @xmath69 orbits .",
    "that gives a rough estimate of the error level .",
    "the statistical errors decrease at large @xmath67 as @xmath70 when quasi - random numbers are used , where @xmath71 is the number of numbers picked for each experiment ( 5 in general , 4 if the binary is circular ) . that is faster than the @xmath72 decrease that occurs with random numbers ( press et al.1992 ) .",
    "the number of orbits needed to reduce the statistical errors to an acceptable level varies widely with the binary and the measurement .",
    "measurements are more difficult for @xmath46 than for @xmath73 because of cancellation .",
    "cancellation is a problem for @xmath73 too at high @xmath25 values . and",
    "regardless of what is being measured , binaries with @xmath19 require many more orbits than equal - mass binaries because of the rare close encounters with the mass @xmath74 .",
    "when the results are presented the number of orbits used will not be given because it is different for each measurement ; some estimate of the statistical error will be given instead .",
    "the numbers are about @xmath75@xmath76 orbits per measurement for @xmath73 ( sometimes more at high @xmath25 values ) and @xmath76@xmath64 for @xmath46 .",
    "the complete set of experiments took about four months of cpu time on an ibm 580 risc workstation .",
    "the hardening rate @xmath73 ( [ eq - h1def ] ) has been measured as a function of the binary s eccentricity and hardness for a wide range of mass ratios .",
    "it is plotted in figure  [ fig - h1 ] versus the hardness as given by the ratio of the initial stellar velocity @xmath25 and the binary s orbital velocity @xmath77 ( the relative velocity of the two bhs if the binary is circular ) : @xmath78 the error bars show the statistical - error estimates ; if not visible then they are smaller than the size of the points .",
    "the velocity dependence of @xmath73 is fit by a function with two free parameters ( whose values are given in table  [ tab - hfit ] ) : @xmath79^{1/2}}.\\ ] ] the function has a constant value @xmath80 at @xmath81 , starts to decrease as @xmath25 approaches @xmath82 , and decreases as @xmath83 at @xmath84 .",
    "this fits the data well at high and low velocities .",
    "it does not fit so well when @xmath73 first starts to decrease ; those data points were given little weight in the fitting procedure .",
    "a three - parameter function was also tried , @xmath85^{2/\\kappa}$ ] , but the exponent @xmath86 never differed by much from 4 .",
    ".parameters for fits to @xmath73 ( eq .  [ eq - hfit ] ) for a circular binary . [ cols=\">,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     consider first the results for an equal - mass binary . at large stellar velocity @xmath46",
    "is small and is negative for some eccentricities .",
    "as the velocity is lowered @xmath46 rises and becomes positive for all eccentricities .",
    "by @xmath87 , @xmath46 has converged to its limit for a hard binary .",
    "that limit gives a maximum growth rate of @xmath88 near @xmath89 , consistent with the results of mikkola and valtonen ( 1992 ) .",
    "the main difference between these results and theirs is at high velocity , where they did not identify negative values for @xmath46 .",
    "those values can reduce a binary s eccentricity when it first starts to harden .",
    "the results for @xmath90 differ from those for an equal - mass binary in two ways : the maximum @xmath46 is about 40% larger , and the hard - binary limit is reached at a lower stellar velocity . in later applications we will need the growth rate for other mass ratios .",
    "we get that by assuming that the velocity @xmath82 ( eq .  [ eq - wfit ] ) determines the transition to the hard - binary limit and that this is the only important dependence on the mass ratio , i.e.  by interpolating the results for @xmath90 at the appropriate value of @xmath91 .",
    "the derivation of the eccentricity growth rate for a maxwellian distribution is more cumbersome than it was for the hardening rate ; it is given in an appendix .",
    "the resulting @xmath15 is the same as @xmath46 at low stellar velocity but does not fall to zero as fast as @xmath46 at high velocity .",
    "the appendix also derives @xmath15 from chandrasekhar s dynamical - friction formula and shows that it greatly overestimates the true growth rate .",
    "we consider a galaxy core with uniform density @xmath4 and velocity dispersion @xmath5 .",
    "the core mass and radius , if needed , are computed from @xmath92 model i , for a large galaxy , has @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 ( dimensional quantities are given in units of @xmath97 , pc , yr , and km / s ) .",
    "model ii , for a small , high - density galaxy , has @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 .",
    "the bhs are assumed to enter the core and form a binary with initial eccentricity @xmath102 and semimajor axis @xmath103 , the latter chosen so that @xmath104 .",
    "that is when the integration starts .",
    "the equations for @xmath105 and @xmath106 for three - body scattering are combined with those of peters ( 1964 ) for gravitational radiation : @xmath107 the equation for @xmath108 is integrated to give the ejected mass but is ignored by the other equations , i.e.  the density and velocity dispersion are held fixed .",
    "it is helpful to first consider how the length and time scales for the evolution vary with @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and the bh masses ( see also bbr ) .",
    "the binary forms at a separation @xmath109 where the enclosed stellar mass equals @xmath6 . it does not become hard until @xmath110 , which happens at about @xmath111 from",
    "then the binary hardens in the time @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a typical hardening rate for a hard binary ( recall that @xmath13 is @xmath114 times smaller than @xmath73 ) .",
    "this should be compared with the time for a circular binary to merge through the emission of gravitational radiation : @xmath115 the two are equal at the semimajor axis @xmath116^{1/5 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the binary orbital velocity at @xmath117 is close to the geometric mean of the velocity dispersion and the speed of light : @xmath118^{1/10 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this tells us the hardness at @xmath117 , what we previously called @xmath119 : @xmath120    two things should be noted about the length scales .",
    "first , @xmath117 is large enough that tidal disruptions can not change the hardening rate by much unless the bhs are very small .",
    "the disruption radius about the larger bh for a star like our sun is @xmath121 which gives @xmath122 for the numbers in equation  ( [ eq - agr ] ) .",
    "that is too small to matter because the main contribution to hardening comes from orbits that do not have close encounters with the bh .",
    "accretion of the disrupted stars will not matter either ( although accretion from some larger gas reservoir can make a difference when the bhs are close ) .",
    "tidal disruptions by the smaller bh can suppress the high - velocity ejections if @xmath65 , but those ejections do not contribute much to the hardening .",
    "the second thing to note is the ratio @xmath123 , which determines how many @xmath124-foldings the binary has to harden between the time it becomes hard and the time radiation takes over : @xmath125^{1/5}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the larger @xmath123 , the more mass the binary ejects and the more its eccentricity grows .",
    "for this example @xmath126 if @xmath127 , but the ratio is smaller if @xmath128 is small or if @xmath129 .",
    "the equations have been integrated for a number of mass combinations in the two galaxy models .",
    "figure  [ fig - bbr6 ] shows the hardening time and the ejected mass for an initial eccentricity of @xmath130 ( the eccentricity does not grow by much for this choice of @xmath102 ) .",
    "the hardening proceeds through three stages : the first ends when the binary becomes hard at @xmath131 , the second starts there and ends when gravitational radiation takes over at @xmath132 , and the third is the final merger stage .",
    "the gradual increase in the hardening time during the first stage is because of the log term in equation  ( [ eq - hsoft ] ) .",
    "all mass combinations harden along the same diagonal line during the second stage because all hard binaries harden at the same rate .",
    "the elapsed time equals the hardening time on that diagonal .",
    "the merger time in the final stage increases as @xmath128 decreases .",
    "the separation between the stages varies with the masses as expected : the smaller @xmath128 , or the smaller @xmath63 , the less room the binary has to harden between @xmath133 and @xmath117 .",
    "some binaries reach @xmath117 before they become hard .    the hardening curves in panels ( a ) and ( b ) are similar to that shown in figure  1 of bbr .",
    "the main differences are that bbr used a constant hardening time from chandrasekhar s dynamical - friction formula during the first stage , and assumed that all binaries become hard at @xmath134 .",
    "the hardening time used here must match onto chandrasekhar s time at a large separation , but not until the log term in equation  ( [ eq - hsoft ] ) matches the usual coulomb logarithm .",
    "the ejected mass is never more than a few times @xmath6 and is less if the bhs are small or if @xmath135 .",
    "it can be estimated by @xmath136 if @xmath137 .",
    "the mass ejected by a binary with @xmath65 can be much larger than @xmath74 even though it is not for an equal - mass binary ; so a bh of mass @xmath138 ejects more mass if it merges with @xmath67 bhs of mass @xmath139 than if it merges with another bh of mass @xmath138 .",
    "the mass displaced from the center of a real galaxy that starts with a density cusp will be larger than the @xmath10 computed here , because some is displaced when the bhs first approach the center and some is nearly but not quite ejected .",
    "the dependence on the initial eccentricity is shown in figure  [ fig - bbre ] for one of the binaries from figure  [ fig - bbr6 ] . if @xmath140 the eccentricity hardly grows before gravitational radiation drives it to zero ; if @xmath141 the eccentricity goes down from the start .",
    "if @xmath142 the eccentricity grows , but not by much .",
    "this conclusion , which mikkola and valtonen ( 1992 ) also reached for an equal - mass binary , is true for all the binaries in figure  [ fig - bbr6 ] .",
    "the merger time is reduced if @xmath102 is large , by about a factor of 20 if @xmath143 for the binary in figure  [ fig - bbre ] .",
    "the reduction could be larger if the hardening stalls during the late stages .",
    "makino et al .",
    "( 1993 ) say their n - body experiments show that massive bh binaries form with large eccentricities , but those experiments use unrealistic galaxy models and atypical initial conditions .",
    "polnarev and rees ( 1994 ) give arguments for why the initial eccentricity should be small .",
    "we can estimate when mass ejection is likely to affect the evolution by considering the mass of stars in the unperturbed galaxy that pass within a distance @xmath144 of a point mass @xmath6 at the center : @xmath145 as the binary hardens , @xmath10 rises and @xmath146 falls . if those two masses become equal the binary will have ejected nearly all the stars that can have a close encounter with it ; further hardening must then wait for new stars to diffuse back into the `` loss - cone '' orbits by two - body relaxation .",
    "the point where @xmath147 , marked by the open circles in figure  [ fig - bbr6 ] , typically occurs before the binary has ejected even one tenth of the mass that it has to eject to merge .",
    "the hardening rate will be reduced by mass ejection before this point is reached .",
    "that will not change the @xmath148 and @xmath149 relations but it will change the time scale for @xmath150 , perhaps making the merger time longer than the age of the galaxy for some of the binaries in figure  [ fig - bbr6 ] .",
    "mass ejection does not bring the hardening to a complete stop even in the absence of two - body relaxation because the binary does not remain fixed at @xmath151 .",
    "a single particle of mass @xmath6 would wander from the center of the unperturbed galaxy with an amplitude @xmath152 the mass scaling suggests that wandering will be more important for small bhs , but a binary with large bhs can wander too once it ejects stars from the center because there is then no restoring force to keep it fixed .",
    "the importance of wandering for the hardening rate is best studied by n - body experiments ; all we can say here is that the merger times in figure  [ fig - bbr6 ] are undoubtably too short .    in summary",
    ", our study of the restricted three - body problem has answered some of the questions posed at the start .",
    "it has given a complete description of how the hardening , mass ejection , and eccentricity growth depend on the properties of a massive bh binary and a uniform galaxy core in which it is embedded .",
    "it has cleared up some confusion resulting from mistaken applications of chandrasekhar s dynamical - friction formula . and it has allowed us to study binary evolution in uniform galaxy cores with some simplifying assumptions .",
    "but it has left two big questions that affect the merger time : what the initial eccentricity is and by how much loss - cone depletion reduces the hardening rate .",
    "it has not allowed us to study binary evolution in realistic galaxy models with density cusps . and it has given only a crude estimate of the changes induced in such models by the evolution .",
    "these questions will be the subject of paper ii .",
