    "recently , the investigations concerning the nonlinear dynamics governed by a multidimensional cubic - quintic nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) received a great deal of attention . in this context ,",
    "both localized vortex solitons and nonlocalized optical vortices were studied @xcite .",
    "cubic - quintic ( @xmath0)-dimensional nlse were used to study the stability of spinning ring solitons @xcite and theoretical investigations to find solitary solutions for the cubic - quintic ( @xmath1)-dimensional nlse have been carried out .",
    "dark solitary waves in the limit of small amplitude have been found , where the nlse was reduced to a korteweg - de vries equation ( kdve ) @xcite . moreover , both algebraic solitary wave solutions @xcite and traveling - wave solutions @xcite have been found and criteria for existence and stability of soliton solutions have been established @xcite .",
    "additionally , a theory which connects envelope solitons of a wide class of generalized nlses with solitons of a wide class of generalized kdve have been recently carried out for arbitrary amplitudes @xcite ; in particular , the theory was applied to find analytical bright , gray and dark envelope soliton solutions of the cubic - quintic nlse and some other types of nonlinearities @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is well known that nonlinear interactions between intense laser beams and a plasma are responsible for numerous nonlinear phenomena including parametric instabilities @xcite , density cavitation , self - focusing and filamentation of light @xcite , as well as the generation of wake fields @xcite .",
    "intense laser beams can cause density modifications through the ponderomotive force , enhance the electron mass due to relativistic effects and produce electron joule heating .",
    "the interplay between the ponderomotive , relativistic and joule heating nonlinearitries has been examined @xcite in the context of laser plasma experiments and also in ionospheric modifications of the earth s ionosphere by powerful radar beams .    in this letter , we investigate nonlinear interactions between the light beams and the non - resonant density perturbations , taking into account the combined effects of the light pressure induced ion density fluctuations and increased electron mass .",
    "we show that , under suitable physical conditions for which our system can be described by a ( @xmath1)-dimensional cubic - quintic nlse for the complex electromagnetic field amplitude , bright , gray and dark envelope solitons are analytically found .",
    "finally , a stability analysis is carried out , which shows that our bright soliton solutions are stable .",
    "we consider the propagation of a large amplitude circularly polarized electromagnetic wave with an electric field @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the wave frequency and @xmath4 is the wavevector .",
    "the light equation in the presence of electron density perturbations in a plasma is obtained from @xmath5 with @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the wave magnetic field , @xmath11 is the vector potential , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the unperturbed and perturbed electron number densities , @xmath14 is the particle quiver velocity induced by the photons , @xmath15 is the momentum , @xmath16 is the mass , @xmath17 is the rest electron mass , @xmath18 is the magnitude of the electron charge , and @xmath19 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "the perturbation of the number density @xmath20 is reinforced by the light ponderomotive force .",
    "for our purposes , we have @xmath21 in view of ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) . here",
    "we have denoted @xmath22 . combining ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) we obtain @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the plasma frequency , @xmath25 , and where we have introduced the coulomb gauge @xmath26 .",
    "we note that the term proportional to @xmath20 comes from the beating of the light quiver velocity with the electron density perturbations of the plasma slow motion , while the nonlinear term in @xmath27 arises due to the electron mass increase in the light wave fields .",
    "supposing that @xmath28 + complex conjugate , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 represent slowly varying space and time coordinates , we obtain from ( 7 ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the group velocity of the light wave , and @xmath33 has been invoked in view of the wkb approximation .",
    "we have denoted @xmath34 .",
    "we now derive the equation for low - phase velocity ( in comparison with the electron thermal speed ) density perturbations that are driven by the light wave ponderomotive force .",
    "the governing equations are the inertialess electron momentum equation @xmath35 the ion continuity equation @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the ambipolar potential , @xmath39 is the fluid velocity associated with the plasma slow motion , and @xmath40 is the electron ( ion ) temperature .",
    "the second term on the right - hand side of ( 9 ) represents the light pressure .",
    "equations ( 9 ) to ( 11 ) form a closed system when the quasi - neutrality @xmath41 is invoked .",
    "the light ponderomotive force acting on the ion fluid is insignificant .",
    "equation ( 9 ) shows that the electrons are pushed away from the region of maximum light intensity , and reinforce a space charge field ( @xmath42 ) and the associated density fluctuations .",
    "the light ponderomotive force is transmitted to ions through the space charge field / ambipolar potential . adding ( 9 ) and ( 11 ) and letting @xmath43 , @xmath44",
    ", we obtain for @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xmath47 where for consistency we have supposed @xmath48 and , consequently , introduced a small perturbation @xmath49 of the electron relativistic factor @xmath27 ( @xmath50 , where @xmath51 ) and @xmath52^{1/2}$ ] is the effective sound speed . according to the above approximations , equation ( 8) becomes @xmath53 { \\bf a}_s=0 , \\ ] ] and ( 12 ) , combined with the linearized version of ( 10 ) , yields @xmath54 equations ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) are the desired equations for coherent light beams that are coupled with non - resonant density perturbations in an electron - ion plasma . note that , in principle , the quantities @xmath55 and @xmath56 , involved in eq .",
    "( 13 ) , could be of the same order . in the following ,",
    "this physical circumstance will be considered and , to this end , we seek possible stationary nonlinear solutions of equations ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) . in the form of envelope solitons",
    "in this section we analyse numerically both the influence of the quintic nonlinearity on the modulational instability and on the stability of a class of solitonlike solutions obtained in the previous sections .",
    "equation ( 21 ) is solved numerically using a standard pseudo - spectral code with a second order runge - kutta method for advancing in time .",
    "we recall that the use of pseudo - spectral code implies the assumption of periodic boundary conditions .      accordingly to the linear stability analysis performed previously , initial conditions for our numerical simulations are given as follows : @xmath135 , \\label{in_co}\\ ] ] where @xmath136 is the amplitude of the small perturbation and is taken as @xmath137 the amplitude of the umperturbed wave . without loss of generality in our simulations",
    "we have choosen @xmath138 and @xmath139 and have considered only one period of the perturbation .",
    "we have performed several numerical simulations with different values of the parameter @xmath75 .",
    "for @xmath138 the theory predicts stability for @xmath140 . in fig .",
    "1 we show the evolution of a plane wave in the @xmath141 plane for @xmath142 .",
    "the initial wave field persists for all times . for @xmath143 modulational instability should occur . in fig .",
    "2 we show the case of @xmath144 ; analogously with the standard modulational instability we observe a fermi - pasta - ulam recurrence : periodically the perturbation grows , the wave reaches a maximum amplitude and then goes back to the initial condition . for @xmath145",
    "a completely different physics takes place : in fig .",
    "3 , obatined for @xmath146 , we do not observe anymore a recurrence and as time passes the wave amplitude increases while the its width decreses .",
    "this phenomenon corresponds to the initial stage of a wave collapse ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is well know that the cubic nls equations ( @xmath122 ) posses solitons solutions if @xmath132 is greater than zero .",
    "we here investigate numerically if the solitonlike solutions described previously are stable or not . in order to to",
    "that we simply consider a solitonlike solution at time @xmath147 and we let evolve numerically the eq .",
    "( 21 ) . for semplicity",
    "we restrict our analysis to a sub class of solutions which corresponds to the case of bright solitons with @xmath148 .",
    "we have performed many different numerical simulations with different values of the parameter @xmath75 .",
    "the major result obtained is the following : if @xmath143 solutions are stable and for @xmath149 are unstable .",
    "this is due to the fact that for @xmath143 the coefficients in front of the cubic and quintic nonlinearities , respectivelly @xmath132 and @xmath73 , have opposite sign and therefore there is a sort of balance between nonlinearities that stabilizes the solitonlike solution .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath149 : both nonlinearities have the same sign and the dispersion is not strong enough to balance them . in figs . 4 and 5 we give numerical evidence of the results presented for @xmath150 and for @xmath151 respectivelly .",
    "the first case , fig .",
    "4 , corresponds to a stable solutions ( the wave profile does not change as time @xmath84 passes ) . the second case , fig .",
    "5 , is the unstable case : a clear increase in the wave amplitude is shown .",
    "according to the above stability analysis we can conclude that our soliton solutions are stable in the range where @xmath152 only ; this inequality , according to section [ third ] , is consistent with the conditions for their existence in our problem .",
    "to summarize , we have considered the nonlinear interaction between intense light beams and the non - resonant density perturbations , taking into account the relativistic mass increase of the electrons as well as the light beam ponderomotive force that reinforces the density perturbations in an electron - ion plasma .",
    "the nonlinear coupling is governed by a pair of equations which , in one space dimension admit stationary solutions in the form of a planar bright and dark / gray envelope solitons .",
    "the condition of stability of the bright soliton - like solutions has been found numerically and it has shown that they are stable just for the range of parameters required in our problem.unfortunately , the numerical stability analysis for the family of dark and gray solitons , although revealed to be much more difficult , is on the way .",
    "authors expect that the preliminary numerical analysis of the stability carried out in the present paper will be extended to the dark and gray solitons in a future work .",
