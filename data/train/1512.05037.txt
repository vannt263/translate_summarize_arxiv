    "[ fig1 ] ) .    .",
    "it is also relevant to consider that processes of energy release in the form of x - ray flux near the central black hole occurred also in our galaxy about hundred years ago although with a significantly smaller luminosity . from analyses of x - ray emission from the molecular clouds in the galactic center",
    ", it was concluded that about 100 years ago the x - ray luminosity of our central black hole was several orders of magnitude higher ( @xmath13 erg s@xmath7 ) ( see the pioneer publications of * ? ? ?",

    "* and subsequent publication of @xcite and others ) than at present ( @xmath14 erg s@xmath7 ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this emission switched - off @xmath15 years ago , and is not seen now , but its afterglow is observed at present as :    * continuum x - ray emission due to thomson scattering ( reflection ) of primary photons on electrons of molecular clouds ( * ? ? ?",

    "as follows from the analysis of the continuum and the 6.4 kev iron line emission in the direction of the cloud sgr b2 , it was almost stationary for more than 5 years ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , which is about the characteristic time for x - ray photons to cross the cloud .",
    "after that the intensity of emission from the cloud had dropped down , because the photon front left sgr b2 @xcite .",
    "the cloud sgr b2 , whose reflected emission is observed at present , is at a distance about 100 pc from the gc .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that processes of the thomson scattering could take place nearby the black hole at the initial stage of the flare , because there are many gaseous complexes in the close vicinity of the gc ( see * ? ? ?",

    "we speculate that processes of thomson scattering may take place in the vicinity of the _ swift _ j1644 center , which result in a weak but nearly constant luminosity x - ray afterglow . if the central source is surrounded by a gas , then it is inevitable that a flux of reflected photons must be generated in this region .",

    "the density of background gas around sw j1644 + 57 are very uncertain although @xcite derived model dependent estimate of the density from the observed radio emission of sw j1644 + 57 .",
