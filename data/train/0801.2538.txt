    "dynamic stability of spherical stars is determined by an average adiabatic power @xmath0 . for a density distribution @xmath1 ,",
    "the star in the newtonian gravity is stable against dynamical collapse when @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this approximate criterium becomes exact for adiabatic stars with constant @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 is a central density , @xmath5 is a stellar mass , @xmath6 is the mass inside a lagrangian radius @xmath7 , so that @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 is a stellar radius .",
    "collapse of a spherical star may be stopped only by a stiffening of the equation of state , like neutron star formation at late stages of evolution , or formation of fully ionized stellar core with @xmath11 at collapse of clouds during star formation . without a stiffening a spherical star in the newtonian theory",
    "would collapse into a point with an infinite density ( singularity ) .    in the presence of a rotation a star is becoming more dynamically stable against collapse .",
    "due to the more rapid increase of a centrifugal force during contraction , in comparison with the newtonian gravitational force , collapse of a rotating star will be always stopped at finite density by centrifugal forces . here",
    "we show , that deviation from the spherical symmetry in a non - rotating star with zero angular momentum leads to a similar stabilization , and non - spherical star without dissipative processes never will reach a singularity .",
    "therefore collapse to a singularity is connected with a secular type of instability , even without rotation .    when a uniform sphere of cold gas is set into free - fall collapse under its self - gravity",
    "its shape is unstable .",
    "the linear instability of large - scale modes ( second - order harmonics ) during the collapse was discovered by @xcite and for the case of non - rotating sphere by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "numerical investigations of collapsing pressureless spheroids have been done in the papers of @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was also shown that the pressure prevents the development of large - scale shape instability if initially the gravity is more than three - fifths pressure resisted .",
    "@xcite derived the equations of motion for a rotating ellipsoid from a system of hydrodynamical equations .",
    "however , the accounting for pressure effects in his approach was inconsistent with thermal processes , leading to the wrong results for the dynamical behaviour of a system with radiative losses ( see @xcite ) . using the variational principle and deriving the equation for the entropy function from energy balance give the correct relations for the pressure and the total energy . in @xcite",
    "the virial equations for rotating riemann ellipsoids of incompressible fluid are demonstrated to form a hamiltonian dynamical system .",
    "we calculate a dynamical behavior of a non - spherical , non - rotating star after its loss of a linear stability , and investigate nonlinear stages of contraction .",
    "we use approximate system of dynamic equations , describing 3 degrees of freedom of a uniform self - gravitating compressible ellipsoidal body ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we obtain that the development of instability leads to the formation of a regularly or chaotically oscillating body , in which dynamical motion prevents the formation of the singularity .",
    "we find regions of chaotic and regular pulsations by constructing a poincar diagram for different values of the initial eccentricity and initial entropy .",
    "for simplicity we restrict ourself by calculating only spheroidal figures with @xmath12 , and only briefly represent results for @xmath13 . at the end",
    "we discuss qualitatively effects of general relativity in a non - spherical collapse of a non - rotating body .",
    "let us consider 3-axis ellipsoid with semi - axes @xmath14 :    @xmath15    and uniform density @xmath16 .",
    "a mass @xmath6 of the uniform ellipsoid is written as ( @xmath17 is the volume of the ellipsoid )    @xmath18    let us assume a linear dependence of velocities on coordinates    @xmath19    the gravitational energy of the uniform ellipsoid is defined as @xcite :    @xmath20    the equation of state @xmath21 is considered here , with @xmath22 .",
    "note that the case @xmath23 was considered by @xcite and @xcite , but this case is not interesting for the present work , because isentropic spherical star with @xmath23 always stops contraction , and never suffers collapse to singularity . a spherical star with @xmath22 collapses to singularity at small enough @xmath24 , and we show here , how deviations from a spherical form prevent formation of any singularity . for @xmath25 ,",
    "the thermal energy of the ellipsoid is @xmath26 , and the value @xmath27 remains constant in time .",
    "a lagrange function of the ellipsoid is written as @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 equations of motion describing behavior of 3 semiaxes @xmath31 is obtained from the lagrange function ( [ lagr - funct ] ) in the form    @xmath32    @xmath33    @xmath34    @xmath35",
    "to obtain a numerical solution of equations we write them in non - dimensional variables .",
    "let us introduce the variables @xmath36 @xmath37 the scaling parameters @xmath38 are connected by the following relations @xmath39 system of non - dimensional equations : @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath35    in equations ( [ eq28])-([eq30 ] ) only non - dimensional variables are used , and `` tilde '' sign is omitted for simplicity in this section .",
    "the non - dimensional hamiltonian ( or non - dimensional total energy ) is : @xmath43 @xmath44 in case of the sphere ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) the non - dimensional hamiltonian and non - dimensional equations of motion reduce to : @xmath47 @xmath48 as follows from ( [ sphere - h ] ) , ( [ sphere1-h ] ) for the given mass there is only one equilibrium value of @xmath49 @xmath50 at which the spherical star has zero total energy , and it may have an arbitrary radius . for smaller @xmath51",
    "the sphere should contract to singularity , and for @xmath52 there will be a total disruption of the star with an expansion to infinity .",
    "we solve here numerically the equations of motion for a spheroid with @xmath53 , which , using ( [ eq28])-([eq30 ] ) , are written for the oblate spheroid with @xmath54 as    @xmath55+\\ , \\frac{5}{3m}\\ , \\frac{1}{a } \\,\\frac { \\varepsilon } { ( a^2c)^{1/3}},\\ ] ]    @xmath56 + \\frac{5}{3m}\\ , \\frac{1}{c } \\,\\frac { \\varepsilon } { ( a^2c)^{1/3}};\\ ] ]    and for the prolate spheroid @xmath57 as    @xmath58 + \\frac{5}{3m}\\ , \\frac{1}{a } \\,\\frac { \\varepsilon } { ( a^2c)^{1/3}},\\ ] ]    @xmath59 + \\frac{5}{3m}\\ , \\frac{1}{c } \\,\\frac { \\varepsilon } { ( a^2c)^{1/3}}.\\ ] ]    it is convenient to introduce variables    @xmath60    in these variables the equations ( [ eq7])-([eq8p ] ) , ( [ sphere1-h ] ) are written as ( omitting subscript `` * '' )    @xmath61+\\ ,   \\frac{1}{a } \\,\\frac { \\varepsilon } { ( a^2c)^{1/3}},\\ ] ]    @xmath62 +   \\frac{1}{c } \\,\\frac { \\varepsilon } { ( a^2c)^{1/3}}\\ ] ]    for the oblate spheroid @xmath54 ,    @xmath63 +   \\frac{1}{a } \\,\\frac { \\varepsilon } { ( a^2c)^{1/3}},\\ ] ]    @xmath64 +   \\frac{1}{c } \\,\\frac { \\varepsilon } { ( a^2c)^{1/3}}\\ ] ]    for the prolate spheroid @xmath57 , and    @xmath65    for the sphere , where the equilibrium corresponds to @xmath66 . near the spherical shape we should use expansions around @xmath67 , what leads to equations of motion valid for both oblate and prolate cases    @xmath68 @xmath69 in these variables",
    "the total energy is written as    @xmath70    and omitting `` * '' we have    @xmath71    @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 solution of the system of equations ( [ eq7])-([eq8p ] ) was performed for initial conditions at @xmath76 : @xmath77 , different values of initial @xmath78 , and different values of the constant parameter @xmath49 .",
    "evidently , at @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 we have the spherical collapse to singularity .",
    "the most interesting result was obtained at @xmath82 , and all other cases with deviations from spherical symmetry .",
    "no singularity was reached in this case for any @xmath83 .",
    "it is clear , that at @xmath84 a weak singularity is reached during formation of a pancake with infinite volume density , and finite gravitational force . at @xmath83",
    "the behavior depends on the value of the total energy @xmath85 : at @xmath86 we obtain a full disruption of the body , and at @xmath87 the oscillatory regime is established at any value of @xmath81 . at @xmath88",
    "the total energy of spheroid is positive , @xmath86 , determining the full disruption .",
    "the case with @xmath89 is described separately below .",
    "at @xmath87 the type of oscillatory regime depends on initial conditions , and may be represented either by regular periodic oscillations , or by chaotic behavior .",
    "examples of two types of such oscillations are represented in figs.1 - 2 ( regular , periodic ) , and in fig.3 ( chaotic ) .",
    "for rigorous separation between these kinds of oscillations we use a method developed by poincar @xcite .      in the case of a sphere with zero initial radial velocity we have equilibrium state with @xmath90 .",
    "let us consider the case of @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "it follows from ( [ ham1 ] ) , that for non - zero initial velocity @xmath93 entropy function @xmath49 is strictly less than unity .",
    "the fate of such sphere depends on the sigh of @xmath94 . at @xmath95",
    "the star collapses to singularity , and at @xmath96 there total disruption happens , with zero velocity at infinity .    for the initial spheroid with @xmath97 , and zero initial velocities @xmath98 the entropy function",
    "is also less than 1 . in this case",
    "the value of the entropy function @xmath49 is uniquely determined by the deformation @xmath99 .",
    "this dependence can be found explicitly from ( [ ham1 ] ) ; for small @xmath100 we obtain    @xmath101    thus even in the case of zero initial velocities , @xmath49 is less than unity for a spheroid , and reaches unity only for the sphere . for the same @xmath49 the deformation @xmath100 of the zero energy body at rest have two states with @xmath102 , corresponding to oblate and prolate spheroids .",
    "if we set non - zero initial velocities in case of spheroid , entropy function will be even less .",
    "calculation of the motion in this case leads finally to the expansion of the body , with oscillating behavior of @xmath100 around zero ( oblate - prolate oscillations ) .",
    "it takes place both under the condition of the initial contraction or initial expansion .",
    "to investigate regular and chaotic dynamics we use the method of poincar section @xcite and obtain the poincar map for different values of the total energy @xmath85 .",
    "let us consider a spheroid with semi - axes @xmath53 .",
    "this system has two degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore in this case the phase space is four - dimensional : @xmath103 , @xmath94 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "if we choose a value of the hamiltonian @xmath106 , we fix a three - dimensional energy surface @xmath107 . during the integration of the equations ( [ eq7])-([eq8p ] ) which preserve the constant @xmath85 , we fix moments @xmath108 , when @xmath109 . at these moments",
    "there are only two independent values ( i.g . @xmath103 and @xmath94 ) , because the value of @xmath104 is determined uniquely from the relation for the hamiltonian at constant @xmath85 . at each moment",
    "@xmath108 we put a dot on the plane @xmath110 .    for the same values of @xmath85 and @xmath49 we solve equations of motion ( [ eq7])-([eq8p ] ) at initial @xmath111 , and different @xmath112 . for each integration we put the points on the plane @xmath110 at the moments @xmath108 .",
    "these points are the intersection points of the trajectories on the three - dimensional energy surface with a two - dimensional plane @xmath109 , called the poincar section .    for each fixed combination of @xmath113",
    "we get the poincar map , represented in figs . 3 - 6 .",
    "condition @xmath109 splits in two cases , of a minimum and of a maximum of @xmath104 .",
    "the poincar maps are drawing separately , either for the minimum , or for the maximum of @xmath104 , and both maps lead to identical results .",
    "the regular oscillations are represented by closed lines on the poincar map , and chaotic behavior fills regions of finite square with dots .",
    "these regions are separated from the regions of the regular oscillations by separatrix line .      actually , the variables @xmath103 and @xmath94 can not occupy the whole plane @xmath114 . let us obtain a curve bounding the area of the values @xmath103 and @xmath94 .",
    "let a function @xmath115 in the variables ( [ eqvar ] ) , ( [ eqvar1 ] ) be    @xmath116 @xmath117 at @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath109 , and fixed value of @xmath49 and @xmath85 .",
    "the equation for the bounding curve @xmath120 at given @xmath49 and @xmath85 is determined from the following system of equation    @xmath121    in case of @xmath122 this system of equations has a form    @xmath123    @xmath124    this system is solved numerically . the second equation does nt depend on @xmath94 .",
    "we set @xmath103 and obtain corresponding value of @xmath104 from the second equation .",
    "then we substitute @xmath103 and @xmath104 into the first equation and find @xmath94 .",
    "thus we obtain the point @xmath110 .",
    "changing @xmath103 , we obtain numerically the curve @xmath125 .",
    "this bounding curve is painted in figs.4 - 8 by a heavy line .",
    "the main result following from our calculations is the indication to a degenerate nature of formation of a singularity in unstable newtonian self - gravitating gaseous bodies .",
    "only pure spherical models can collapse to singularity , but any kind of nonsphericity leads to nonlinear stabilization of the collapse by a dynamic motion , and formation of regularly or chaotically oscillating body .",
    "this conclusion is valid for all unstable equations of state , namely , for adiabatic with @xmath126 .",
    "in addition to the case with @xmath22 , we have calculated the dynamics of the model with @xmath127 , and have obtained similar results .",
    "the poincar map for this case is represented in fig.9 . for @xmath127",
    "we have the entropy function @xmath128 , nondimensional entropy function @xmath129 , see ( [ scal - par ] ) . for the spherical star with @xmath127 the nondimensional hamiltonian instead of ( [ sphere - h ] )",
    "is @xmath130 note , that region of chaotic behavior on the poincar map is gradually increasing for @xmath131 with decreasing of the entropy @xmath49 and the total energy @xmath85 . at @xmath132 and @xmath133",
    "we have found only regular oscillations ( fig.8 ) , at @xmath134 and @xmath135 both kind of oscillations are present ( figs .",
    "4 - 6 ) , and only chaotic behavior is found at @xmath136 and @xmath137 ( fig.7 ) .",
    "we connect @xcite this chaotic behavior with development of anisotropic instability , when radial velocities strongly exceed the transversal ones @xcite .    in reality",
    "a presence of dissipation leads to damping of these oscillations , and to final collapse of nonrotating model , when total energy of the body is negative . in the case of core - collapse supernova",
    "the main dissipation is due to emission of neutrino .",
    "the time of the neutrino losses is much larger than the characteristic time of the collapse , so we may expect that the collapse leads to formation of a neutron star where nonspherical modes are excited and exist during several seconds after the collapse .",
    "in addition to the damping due to neutrino emission the shock waves will be generated , determining highly variable energy losses during the oscillations . besides viscosity and radiation which can damp the ellipsoid - like motions and allow collapse",
    ", there is the possibility that inertial interactions with higher order modes that must be present in the real stratified bodies may cause an inertial cascade and drain the energy from the second order modes an a non - secular way that does not depend on dissipative coefficients .",
    "it is very seductive to connect chaotic oscillations with highly variable emission observed in the prompt gamma ray emission of cosmic gamma ray bursts @xcite .",
    "a presence of rotation and magnetic field strongly complicate the picture of the core - collapse supernova explosion @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider in details only spheroidal bodies . in reality",
    "the spheroid will become a triaxial ellipsoid during the motion .",
    "in addition to spheroids we calculate many variants with triaxial figures ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "qualitatively we obtain the same results for ellipsoids : no singularity was reached for any @xmath138 and establishing oscillatory ( regular or chaotic ) regime under negative total energy prevents the collapse .",
    "however , in the case of the ellipsoid with semi - axes @xmath139 we have a system with three degrees of freedom and six - dimensional phase space",
    ". therefore we could not carry out rigorous investigation of regular and chaotic types of motion by the constructing poincar map as it was done for spheroid with two degrees of freedom , and restricted ourselfs by a description of the spheroidal case .    in the frame of a general relativity dynamic stabilization against collapse by nonlinear nonspherical oscillations can not be universal .",
    "when the size of the body approaches gravitational radius no stabilization is possible at any @xmath3 .",
    "nevertheless , the nonlinear stabilization may happen at larger radii , so after damping of the oscillations the star would collapse to the black hole . due to development of nonspherical oscillations there is a possibility for emission of gravitational waves during the collapse of nonrotating stars with the intensity similar to rotating bodies , or even larger .",
    "account of general relativity will introduce a new non - dimensional parameter , which can be written as @xmath140 .",
    "the fate of the gravitating body will depend on the value of this parameter , and we may expect a direct relativistic collapse to a black hole at increasing @xmath141 , approaching unity .",
    "it is known , that a nonrotating black hole is characterized only by its mass @xcite . in absence of other dissipative processes ,",
    "the excess of energy , connected with a nonspherical motion should be emitted by gravitational waves during a formation of the black hole .",
