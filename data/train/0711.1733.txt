    "the clifford model of quantum computation deals with the unitary time evolution of pauli operators going through a selected set of generating quantum gates .",
    "one first notices that the traditional picture of unitary evolution of quantum states under an hamiltonian has to be replaced by an evolution of operators under a properly chosen group action .",
    "this is analogous to the heisenberg representation of quantum mechanics , where the operators evolve , as opposed to the schrdinger picture , where the states evolve @xcite .",
    "pauli operators are defined as @xmath14-fold tensor products of the identity and the ordinary pauli matrices .",
    "various quantum error correcting codes have been developed for the states arising from the pauli operators @xcite-@xcite .",
    "one of the challenges has been to identify the types of quantum computations that can be classically simulated .",
    "one earliest result in this context is gottesman - knill theorem @xcite which essentially relies on a stabilizer formalism and describes the unitary dynamics and the measurements .",
    "the generating quantum gates of the stabilizer formalism are the hadamard operation @xmath15 $ ] and the @xmath0 phase gate @xmath16 acting on a single qubit , and the controlled-@xmath17 gate @xmath18 acting on two qubits .",
    "using these building gates , tensor products of them and measurements of the pauli operators , any quantum computation is , in principle , efficiently simulated on a classical computer .",
    "another type of quantum computation , using measurements as computational steps , is being developed @xcite-@xcite , but it will not be the topic of the present paper .    instead we will propose a detailed group theoretical analysis of the clifford group acting on one or two qubits , using the group theoretical package gap4 @xcite as our classical simulator .",
    "a number of recent papers deal with the clifford group analysis in relation to quantum computing @xcite , quantum measurements @xcite or local encoding of classical information @xcite .",
    "so far the connection to the geometry of mathieu groups seems to have remained unoticed .",
    "let us start with the standard single qubit @xmath19 ( shift ) , @xmath20 ( clock ) and @xmath21 pauli matrices .",
    "the corresponding pauli group @xmath22 may be defined from three generators , i.e. @xmath23 . the pauli group on @xmath14 qubits is the @xmath14-fold tensor product of @xmath22 and has order @xmath24 .",
    "all elements of @xmath25 commuting with any other operator are in the center @xmath26 .    in our previous papers",
    "we extensively studied the commutation relations within the two - qubit pauli group @xcite and found the finite projective geometry underlying them . skipping the elements in the center , the fifteen tensor products of pauli matrices @xmath27",
    ", @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , can be labeled as @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35  , @xmath36 ,  , @xmath37,  .",
    "the commutation rules between them are displayed in fig .",
    "each _ line _ of mutually commuting operators contains exactly three _",
    "points _ and each _ point _ is on three _",
    "lines_. any point not on a line ( an antiflag ) is on a unique line intersecting it .",
    "this type of geometry is known as a generalized quadrangle and the two - qubit system provides the smallest example , having fifteen points and , by duality , fifteen lines .",
    "the three operators on a line share ( stabilize ) a common set of four quantum states known as a base .",
    "one clearly observes in fig .",
    "1 that a maximum of five non - intersecting lines can be obtained , which corresponds to a maximal set of five mutually unbiased bases in this dimension ( see @xcite,@xcite for more about mutually unbiased bases ) .",
    "six of the ( boldfaced ) lines form a grid of entangled bases known as a mermin square in reference to their ability to prove the kochen - specker theorem in dimension four @xcite .    in this representation of the commutation relations it is also apparent that there is a six - fold symmetry of the two - qubit system [ and of the generalized quadrangle @xmath3 ] .",
    "let us now see the quadrangle as a graph .",
    "any point / vertex is connected to six distinct vertices and the whole graph can be defined as the complement @xmath39 of the line graph over the complete graph @xmath40 with six vertices .",
    "it is also known that the automorphism ( symmetry ) group of the quadrangle @xmath3 is precisely the symmetric group with six elements @xmath2 .",
    "finally there are six maximal sets of five disjoint lines ( corresponding to six distinct complete sets of mutually unbiased bases ) and any two distinct sets share a single line , a feature which can be still be represented as a complete graph @xmath40 .",
    "it will be shown in sec [ cliff ] that the six - fold symmetry also arises within the two - qubit clifford group .",
    "the geometry underlying multiple qubits is a symplectic polar space of order two @xcite .",
    "totally isotropic subspaces , there are @xmath41 of them within the polar space , correspond to mutually unbiased bases .",
    "see also refs @xcite,@xcite .",
    "let us assume a quantum computer in a state @xmath42 , and apply to it an error @xmath43 belonging to the pauli group @xmath44 so that the new state of the computer is @xmath45 .",
    "one allows unitary evolutions @xmath46 so that the new state evolves as @xmath47 . for stabilizing the error within the pauli group @xmath44 ,",
    "one requires that @xmath48 .",
    "the set of operators which leaves @xmath44 invariant under conjugation is the normalizer @xmath49 in the unitary group @xmath50 , also known as the clifford group @xmath51 * ? ? ?",
    "one learned from gottesman - knill theorem that the hadamard gate @xmath52 and the phase gate @xmath53 are in the one - qubit clifford group @xmath54 , and that the controlled-@xmath17 gate is in the two - qubit clifford group @xmath1 .",
    "any gate in @xmath49 may be generated from the application of gates from @xmath54 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "clifford group @xmath49 on @xmath14-qubits has order @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "below we will concentrate on the properties of the clifford group related to one and two qubits , using the group theoretical package gap4 @xcite .",
    "generation of the gates will be ensured by the use of cyclotomic numbers , as described in sec 18 of the gap4 reference manual .",
    "for example the elements @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 will be modelled as the roots of unity @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 and as @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "some basic knowledge about finite group theory and group of automorphisms can be found in ref @xcite .",
    "the one - qubit clifford group is defined as @xmath64 .",
    "it has order @xmath65 and center isomorphic to the cyclic group @xmath66 .",
    "one defines the _ inner _ group @xmath67 .",
    "elements @xmath14 of @xmath68 which are invariant under a conjugation @xmath69 , @xmath70 , are in a normal subgroup @xmath71 of @xmath68 .",
    "one only finds two non trivial normal subgroups of @xmath68 .",
    "the first one @xmath72 is isomorphic to the klein group @xmath73 .",
    "the second one @xmath74 is isomorphic to the alternating group @xmath75 , the group of orientation preserving symmetries of the tetrahedron .",
    "other useful relations are the isomorphisms @xmath76 , @xmath77 so that @xmath78 , the symmetric group with four elements .",
    "the two - qubit clifford group may be generated as @xmath79 .",
    "it has order @xmath80 and center isomorphic to @xmath66 .",
    "group @xmath81 is of order @xmath82 . as for the single qubit case",
    ", one only discovers two non trivial normal subgroups of @xmath68 .",
    "the first one is @xmath83 and leads to an expression of the inner group as the semi - direct product @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "the second normal subgroup @xmath85 is of order @xmath7 ; it is a perfect group .",
    "it can be seen as a parent of the six element alternating group @xmath11 , because its outer automorphism group @xmath86 is the same , equal to the klein group @xmath73 .",
    "useful expressions are @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the group @xmath12 is an important maximal subgroup of several sporadic groups .",
    "the group of smallest size where it appears is the mathieu group @xmath10 .",
    "mathieu groups are sporadic simple groups , so that @xmath12 is not normal in @xmath10 .",
    "it appears in relation to a subgeometry of @xmath10 known as an _",
    "hexad_. let us recall the definition of steiner systems .",
    "a steiner system @xmath89 with parameters @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , is a @xmath92-element set together with a set of @xmath91-element subsets of @xmath93 ( called _ blocks _ ) with the property that each @xmath90-element subset of @xmath93 is contained in exactly one block .",
    "a finite projective plane of order q , with the lines as blocks , is an @xmath94 , since it has @xmath95 points , each line passes through @xmath96 points , and each pair of distinct points lies on exactly one line .",
    "any large mathieu group can be defined as the automorphism ( symmetry ) group of a steiner system @xcite .",
    "the group @xmath10 stabilizes the steiner system @xmath9 comprising @xmath97 points and @xmath98 blocks , each set of @xmath99 points being contained exactly in one block is the automorphism group of this steiner system , that is , the set of permutations which map every block to some other block .",
    "the subgroups @xmath100 and @xmath10 are defined to be the stabilizers of a single point and two points respectively . ] .",
    "any block in @xmath9 is a mathieu hexad , i.e. it is stabilized by the _",
    "general _ alternating group @xmath12 .",
    "it is well known that among symmetric groups , only @xmath2 has an outer automorphism , the group @xmath101 .",
    "this also yields another outer automorphism attached to @xmath11 , the klein group @xmath73 .",
    "these exceptional automorphism groups among the symmetric and alternating groups may now be put in a geometrical perspective by their relationship to the hexads of the mathieu group @xmath10 , and in a physical perspective by their relation ship to the two - qubit pauli and clifford groups .",
    "we believe that this research opens new vistas on several subjects and leaves open several questions . at the mathematical level",
    ", we would like to clarify the structure of higher order clifford groups .",
    "it is not an easy computational task because already for three qubits the _ inner _ group @xmath68 has order @xmath102 , which seems not to be the size of any known maximal subgroup of sporadic groups . at the quantum computational level , a challenge would be to relate the discovered @xmath98-fold symmetry of @xmath1 to some clever gate design .",
    "finally , the symmetries of @xmath14-qubit systems presumably relate to other branches of group theory such as lie group theory , and algebra , such as clifford algebra , insufficiently explored so far .",
    "see @xcite for recent developments .    as a final note ,",
    "let us mention that the klein group , which appears as the outer automorphism group of the alternating group @xmath11 ( and of its parent , the normal subgroup @xmath12 of the _ inner _ two - qubit clifford group ) can also be viewed as the additive group of the ring @xmath103 .",
    "the projective line over @xmath104 is a three by three grid ( see the boldfaced lines in fig . 1 which models the entanglement part in the quadrangle @xmath3 and ref @xcite ) .",
    "at least for the two - qubit system , there is a nice correspondence between the exceptional outer group of @xmath11 and the so - called mermin square used to prove the kochen - specker theorem in dimension four @xcite .",
    "see also ref @xcite for a different view related to clifford spaces .",
    "the clifford group formalism may in principle be applied to any dimension @xcite .",
    "it is another open problem to relate the corresponding clifford groups to the symplectic polar spaces@xcite and ring projective lines attached to composite systems @xcite .",
