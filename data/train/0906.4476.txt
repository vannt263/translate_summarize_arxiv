    "the sixteen rare , experimentally distinguishable , modes of nuclear @xmath21 decay , namely the double - electron emission @xmath22 , double - positron emission @xmath23 , electron - positron conversion @xmath24 and double - electron capture @xmath25 with the emission of two neutrinos , no neutrinos , single majoron and double majorons , are semileptonic weak transitions involving strangeness conserving charged currents .",
    "the @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 modes are energetically competing and we shall refer to them as @xmath29 decay . the experimental as well as theoretical study of nuclear @xmath30 mode has been excellently reviewed over the past decades , which can be found in the recent review @xcite and references there in .",
    "also , the experimental and theoretical studies devoted to the @xmath29 decay have been reviewed over the past years @xcite .",
    "owing to the confirmation of flavour oscillation of neutrinos at atmospheric , solar , reactor and accelerator neutrino sources , it has been established that neutrinos have mass .",
    "however , it is generally agreed that the observation of @xmath31 decay can clarify a number of issues regarding the nature of neutrinos , namely the origin of neutrino mass ( dirac vs. majorana ) , the absolute scale on neutrino mass , the type of hierarchy and cp violation in the leptonic sector , etc .",
    "further , the possible mechanisms for the occurrence of the lepton number violating @xmath32 decay are the exchange of light as well as heavy neutrinos and the right handed currents in the lrsm , the exchange of sleptons , neutralinos , squarks and gluinos in the @xmath33-violating mssm , the exchange of leptoquarks , existence of heavy sterile neutrinos , compositeness and extradimensional scenarios . in nine majoron models , namely @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xcite , the single majoron accompanied neutrinoless double beta @xmath43 decay and double majoron accompanied neutrinoless double beta @xmath44 decay occur in the former five and the latter four , respectively",
    ". the study of @xmath31 decay can provide stringent limits on the associated gauge theoretical parameters and its observation can only ascertain the role of various possible mechanisms in different gauge theoretical models .    in principle",
    ", the @xmath45 decay and @xmath29 decay can provide us with the same but complementary information .",
    "the observation of @xmath46 decay modes will be interesting from the nuclear structure point of view , as it is a challenging task to calculate the nuclear transition matrix elements ( ntmes ) of these modes along with @xmath47 mode in the same theoretical framework .",
    "further , the observation of @xmath48 decay modes will be helpful in deciding issues like dominance of mass mechanism or right handed currents @xcite . in an attempt to study the role of @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 mechanisms , klapdor - kleingrothaus _ et al .",
    "_ have analyzed the 71.7 kg.y data collected from 1990 - 2003 on enriched @xmath52ge @xcite and have shown that there is an apparent degeneracy in the parameters @xcite .",
    "it has been also concluded that the analysis of a high sensitive @xmath53 experiment e.g. @xmath52ge and a suitable high sensitive mixed mode decay e.g. @xmath54xe is more advantageous @xcite .    in spite of the fact that the kinetic energy release in the @xmath55 mode is the largest ,",
    "the experimental and theoretical study of this mode has not been attempted so far .",
    "the conservation of energy - momentum requires the emission of an additional particle in the @xmath56 mode .",
    "further , the emission of one real photon is forbidden for the @xmath57 transition if atomic electrons are absorbed from the @xmath58-shell .",
    "therefore , one has to consider various processes such as internal pair production , internal conversion , emission of two photons , @xmath59-capture etc . @xcite .",
    "the decay rates of the above mentioned processes have to be calculated at least by the third order perturbation theory .",
    "resultingly , there is a suppression factor of the order of 10@xmath60 in comparison to the @xmath20 mode .",
    "hence , the experimental as well as theoretical study of @xmath48 decay has been restricted to @xmath0 and @xmath20 modes only .",
    "arguably , sujkowski and wycech @xcite have shown that there will be resonant enhancement of the @xmath56 mode if the nuclear levels in parent and daughter nuclei are almost degenerate i.e. @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 , where the energy difference is for atomic levels . interestingly ,",
    "barabash @xmath64 @xmath65 have reported that there might be a degeneracy between the @xmath66sn ground state and an excited 0@xmath67 state at 1870.9 kev in @xmath66cd fulfilling the resonance enhancement condition for the @xmath56 mode @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the study of this @xmath68 mode may be interesting in the near future .",
    "the complex structure of nuclei in general , and of mass region @xmath69 in particular , is due to the subtle interplay of pairing and multipolar correlations present in the effective two - body interaction .",
    "the mass regions @xmath70 and @xmath71 offer nice examples of shape transitions at @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "the nuclei are soft vibrators for neutron number @xmath74 and @xmath75 and quasi - rotors for @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "nuclei with neutron numbers @xmath72 and @xmath73 are transitional nuclei .",
    "the yrast spectra of te and xe isotopes , on the other hand , follow an approximate inverse parabolic type of systematics with minimum energy of @xmath78 states occurring for @xmath79te and @xmath79xe isotopes , respectively . in this mass region",
    "@xmath80 the deformation parameters @xmath81 are in the range @xmath82 corresponding to @xmath83xe and @xmath7gd isotopes , respectively and hence , it is clear that deformation plays a crucial role in reproducing the properties of these nuclei . in nuclear @xmath84 decay ,",
    "the role of deformation degrees of freedom in addition to pairing correlation has been already stressed @xcite .",
    "recently , the effects of pairing and quadrupolar correlations on the ntmes of @xmath53 mode has been studied in the ism @xcite . in the phfb model ,",
    "the role of deformation effects due to quadrupolar @xcite and multipolar correlations @xcite has been also studied .",
    "the shell model is the best choice for calculating the ntmes as it attempts to solve the nuclear many - body problem as exactly as possible .",
    "however , the first explanation about the observed suppression of @xmath85 was provided in the qrpa model by vogel and zirnbauer @xcite and civitarese @xmath64 @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "further , the qrpa and its extensions have emerged as the most successful models in correlating single-@xmath87 gt strengths and half - lives of ( @xmath45)@xmath88 mode . in spite of the spectacular success of the qrpa in the study of @xmath84 decay , the necessity to include the deformation degrees of freedom in its formalism led to the development of the deformed qrpa model for studying @xmath84 decay of spherical as well as deformed nuclei .",
    "the effect of deformation on the @xmath89 mode for the ground state transition @xmath52ge @xmath90 @xmath52se was studied in the framework of deformed qrpa with separable gt residual interaction @xcite and , very recently , employing realistic forces @xcite . a deformed qrpa formalism to describe simultaneously the energy distributions of the single-@xmath87 gt strength and the @xmath47 mode matrix elements for @xmath91ca , @xmath52ge , @xmath92se , @xmath2zr , @xmath93mo , @xmath94cd , @xmath95te , @xmath96xe and @xmath97nd isotopes using deformed woods - saxon potential and deformed skyrme hartree - fock mean field was developed @xcite .",
    "rodin and faessler @xcite have studied the @xmath98 decay of @xmath52ge , @xmath99mo and @xmath6te isotopes and it has been reported that the effect of continuum on the ntmes of @xmath89 mode is negligible whereas the ntmes of @xmath100 mode are regularly suppressed .",
    "in the phfb model , the interplay of pairing and deformation degrees of freedom are treated simultaneously and on equal footing .",
    "however , the structure of the intermediate odd @xmath101-odd @xmath102 nuclei , which provide information on the single-@xmath87 decay rates and the distribution of gt strengths , can not be studied in the present version of the phfb model . in spite of this limitation ,",
    "the phfb model , in conjunction with pairing plus quadrupole - quadrupole ( _ pqq _ ) @xcite interaction has been successfully applied to study the @xmath8 transition of @xmath103 mode , where it was possible to describe the lowest excited states of the parent and daughter nuclei along with their electromagnetic transition strengths , as well as to reproduce their measured @xmath45 decay rates @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of using the _ pqq _ interaction is to study the interplay between sphericity and deformation . in this way ,",
    "the phfb formalism , employed in conjunction with the _ pqq _ interaction , is a convenient choice to examine the explicit role of deformation on the ntmes .",
    "the existence of an inverse correlation between the quadrupole deformation and the size of ntme @xmath85 has been also confirmed @xcite . in addition , it has been observed that the ntmes for @xmath45 decay are usually large in the absence of quadrupolar correlations . with the inclusion of the quadrupolar correlations ,",
    "the ntmes are almost constant for small admixture of the @xmath104 interaction and suppressed substantially in realistic situation .",
    "it was also shown that the ntmes of @xmath45 decay have a well defined maximum when the deformation of parent and daughter nuclei are similar and they are suppressed for a difference in deformations in agreement with previous qrpa calculations @xcite .",
    "the deformation effects are also of equal importance in the case of @xmath105 and @xmath53 modes @xcite .",
    "moreover , the phfb model along with the _ pqq _ interaction in conjunction with the summation method has been successfully applied to study the @xmath46 decay of @xmath2ru , @xmath3pd , @xmath106cd , @xmath107xe , @xmath108ba @xcite and @xmath109dy @xcite isotopes for the @xmath110 transition , not in isolation but together with other observed nuclear spectroscopic properties , namely yrast spectra , reduced @xmath9:@xmath10 transition probabilities , quadrupole moments @xmath11 and gyromagnetic factors @xmath111 .",
    "this success of the phfb model has prompted us to apply the same to study the @xmath8 transition of @xmath0 and @xmath112 modes for the above mentioned nuclei .",
    "it has been observed that in general , there exists an anticorrelation between the magnitude of the quadrupolar deformation and the ntmes @xmath85 of @xmath46 decay . in the case of @xmath46 decay",
    ", we observed that the deformation plays an important role in the suppression of @xmath113 by a factor of 213.6 approximately @xcite .",
    "therefore , we aim to study the variation of ntmes of @xmath17 and @xmath18 modes vis - a - vis the change in deformation by changing the strength of the _ qq _ interaction .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . the theoretical formalism for calculating the half - lives of @xmath0 and @xmath20 modes has been given by doi _",
    "hence , we briefly outline steps of the detailed derivations in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the results and discuss them vis - a - vis the existing calculations done in other nuclear models . in the study of @xmath31 decay , the practice is to either extract limits on various gauge theoretical parameters from the observed limits on half - lives of the @xmath114 decay or predict half - lives assuming certain value for the neutrino mass",
    ". presently , the available experimental limits on half - lives of @xmath0 and @xmath115 modes are not large enough to provide stringent limits on the effective gauge theoretical parameters @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , we also predict half - lives @xmath16 of @xmath118 and @xmath115 modes for @xmath2ru , @xmath3pd , @xmath4cd , @xmath54xe , @xmath6ba and @xmath7dy isotopes , which will be helpful in the future experimental studies of @xmath48 decay . in addition , we study the deformation effect on ntmes of @xmath118 and @xmath115 modes and show that the ntmes have well defined maximum for similar deformations of parent and daughter nuclei and they are suppressed for a difference in deformations . finally , the conclusions are given in sec .",
    "in the majorana neutrino mass mechanism , the effective charged current weak interaction hamiltonian density @xmath119 for @xmath120 decay due to @xmath121-boson exchange including hadronic currents can be written as    @xmath122    the left handed _",
