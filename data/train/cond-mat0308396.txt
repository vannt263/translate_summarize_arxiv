    "solid state oxides containing transition metal ions with unfilled @xmath12 shell electrons have been at the centre of attention in condensed matter and materials physics for the last two decades because of the variety and novelty of electronic phenomena in them and the possibility of new applications .",
    "the @xmath12 electrons in solids are not as extended as @xmath13 electrons or as localized as @xmath14 electrons .",
    "their motion in the system is highly constrained by the large local ( on site ) @xmath15 repulsion or mott - hubbard correlation @xmath10 .",
    "the central question is how this strong correlation , and other factors such as orbital degeneracy and electron lattice coupling , lead to electronic behaviour qualitatively different from that of conventional solids which are successfully described as degenerate fermi liquids with well defined interacting electronic quasi - particles .    while the best known examples of these are the high @xmath16 cuprate superconductors @xcite , during the last decade another group of oxides , namely the manganites @xmath0 ( where @xmath17 etc . and @xmath18 etc",
    ". ) has become a focus of major activity .",
    "the initial interest was sparked by the discovery @xcite that their electrical resistivity changes enormously with the application of a magnetic field , the change ( colossal magnetoresistance or cmr ) being two or more orders of magnitude larger than the normal cyclotron orbital effect characterized by the dimensionless parameter @xmath19 .",
    "subsequent work has shown a bewildering variety of phases , phase transitions and phenomena @xcite depending on the doping @xmath8 , temperature @xmath9 , and ionic species @xmath20 and @xmath21 as well as external perturbations .",
    "an example is the phase diagram of @xmath22 ( fig .",
    "[ phdiag ] ) which shows an insulating , @xmath23 bond ( jahn - teller ) distorted but structurally ordered phase for small @xmath8 , the transition of this at low @xmath9 from a ferromagnetic insulator to a ferromagnetic metal at @xmath24 , and thence to a charge ordered insulating phase for @xmath25 . for @xmath26",
    "this becomes a paramagnetic insulator above a @xmath27 , with cmr near @xmath16 .",
    "the phase diagram varies considerably with the ionic species .",
    "for example , @xmath28 has a paramagnetic metallic phase for @xmath29 and shows no charge / orbital order , while @xmath30 has no metallic phases ( even ferromagnetic)@xcite .",
    "two other general characteristics are the following .",
    "first , physical properties are extremely sensitive to small perturbations ; examples being the cmr itself , the unusually large strain and ion size effects @xcite , the melting of charge / orbital ordering for anomalously small magnetic fields and a metal to insulator transition induced by the electronically benign substitution of @xmath31 by @xmath32 @xcite . secondly , over a wide range of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , two very different types of regions , one insulating and locally lattice distorted and the other metallic and undistorted , coexist @xcite .",
    "the regions can be static @xcite or dynamic @xcite ; their size can vary from @xmath33 @xcite to @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "all these observations suggest that metallic and insulating phases are always very close in free energy .",
    "these phenomena can not be described satisfactorily in terms of well known models for electrons in solids .",
    "for example , one might expect generally that doping @xmath35 ( a mott insulator ) with @xmath36 introduces mobile holes in the @xmath37 band so that the system ought to be metallic at least in the high symmetry paramagnetic phase ; but it is not till @xmath38 .",
    "the observed properties of manganites need to be understood in terms of the active degrees of freedom which are believed to be the twofold degenerate @xmath3 electrons and the @xmath39 core - spins of @xmath4 , and jahn - teller(jt ) optical phonon modes of the oxygen octahedra and the interactions between them .",
    "there are three strong interactions present , namely the large on site @xmath15 repulsion @xmath40 @xcite amongst the @xmath3 electrons , strong jt mode - @xmath3 electron coupling @xmath41 which splits the doubly degenerate @xmath3 level by about @xmath42 @xcite , and the large ferromagnetic hund s rule coupling @xmath43 between @xmath3 and @xmath39 spins ( @xmath44 1 to 2 @xmath45 @xcite ) . for comparison , the @xmath46 electron kinetic energy scale or band width",
    "@xmath47 is @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the presence of a large jt coupling is clearly indicated by the two ` phase ' coexistence@xcite ( with one phase being lattice distorted and insulating , and the other metallic and undistorted ) as well as by the sensitivity of properties to lattice strain or local disorder , and giant isotope effect@xcite alluded to above .",
    "indeed , large jt distortions , while long ranged in @xmath35 , persist locally well into the metallic regime@xcite ( @xmath49 , and @xmath50 ) , where they are short ranged .",
    "understanding the observed consequences of these interactions is one of the major challenges in the physics of strongly correlated electrons .",
    "most existing theories @xcite for manganites neglect one or the other of these strong interactions , make further approximations , and are inadequate qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "the earliest theoretical approaches @xcite , commonly referred to as double exchange theories , consider solely the hund s rule exchange @xmath43 .",
    "however , only a metallic state is possible in this case .",
    "a theory due to millis , mueller and shraiman @xcite additionally includes the effect of the coupling @xmath41 , but treats the local jt lattice distortion classically , as annealed static disorder , and neglects @xmath10 .",
    "a polaronic insulating phase also occurs in that case for large enough @xmath41 , but the predicted results do not resemble experiments ; for example at @xmath51 , one finds only metal - metal or insulator - insulator curie transitions , unlike the commonly observed metal - insulator transition .",
    "the magnetoresistance is not colossal and there is no isotope effect .",
    "dagotto and coworkers ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) have done extensive numerical simulations of several models , but on rather small lattices , and seen lots of instances of `` phase separation '' .",
    "the early simulations explored the competition between ( double exchange induced ) ferromagnetism and anti - ferromagnetic ( super)exchange , amplification and generation of small scale phase co - existence by disorder , and identified the two kinds of magnetic domains with metallic and insulating regions .",
    "later simulations explored similar issues including static jt couplings .",
    "based on these , they suggest@xcite that transport in manganites should be pictured in terms of a random resistor network arising from tunnelling between misaligned ferromagnetic metallic domains across insulating regions , and that the cmr arises from enhanced tunnelling due to field induced alignment of the magnetic domains .",
    "there are many other models designed to address specific effects , but no theoretical ideas which explain the novel general features of manganites cohesively .",
    "we propose here a new approach to the physics of manganites which includes all the three strong interactions , the double degeneracy of @xmath3 orbitals as well as the quantum dynamics of phonons .",
    "it leads to a simple physical description from which the properties of manganites follow naturally .",
    "calculations of ground state and transport properties at finite temperatures are also presented .",
    "we believe that the ideas are of wide relevance to a large number of solid state and molecular systems with similar ingredients .",
    "our ideas are principally based on two facts ; namely the two fold degeneracy of the @xmath3 orbital and the strong ( degeneracy lifting ) jt interaction characterized by the large dimensionless ratio @xmath52 , ( @xmath53 for manganites , see ref.@xcite ) where @xmath54 is the jt optical phonon energy @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "this coupling leads ( as shown in greater detail below ) to a large local jt distortion @xmath56 being associated with one linear combination of the orbitals ( jt polaron , labelled @xmath5 by us ) when it occupied by a single electron . if the jt modes are not approximated as static displacements @xcite but are treated quantum - dynamically , the inter - site hopping of the jt polaron is reduced by the exponential huang rhys @xcite factor @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "this is the _",
    "antiadiabatic limit _ overlap between the initial and final jt phonon wave functions ( centred around @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) when the @xmath5 electron moves in or out of a site .",
    "the corresponding effective @xmath5-bandwidth , @xmath62 , is thus very small , so the @xmath5 states are easily localized by any disorder present ( eg . in cation site energy ) .",
    "they can hence be regarded , to a first approximation ( which may be inaccurate for @xmath63 because of inter - site coherence , see section 8) , as non dispersive localized levels .",
    "the @xmath5 polaron is probably close to this limit over a wide range of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where large local @xmath64 distortion without long range order is seen @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath3 orbital at each site is doubly degenerate initially , there is another orthogonal set of states which we label @xmath6 , which have their largest amplitudes at the fraction @xmath8 of hole sites where the polaron is not present ; their occupancy on the polaron site costs a large extra energy @xmath65 .",
    "the ( bare ) hopping @xmath66 amongst these @xmath6 states is not reduced and they form a broad band ( of bare width @xmath67 ev ) whose properties are strongly affected , eg .",
    "their effective bandwidth @xmath68 is renormalized to smaller values , by the other two strong interactions present in the system , namely the repulsive scattering from the @xmath5 polarons ( @xmath69 ) and the coupling to the @xmath39 spins @xmath70 depending on @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "roughly , @xmath68 increases with @xmath8 as well as with @xmath71 and @xmath72 , because the inhibition of @xmath6 hopping due to large @xmath69 is reduced when there are more hole - sites , and that due to large @xmath43 is reduced when the @xmath39 spin order is enhanced .",
    "we believe that the unique feature of manganites is this necessary coexistence of antiadiabatic , jt distorted , localized @xmath73 states and adiabatic , undistorted , broad band @xmath74 states , arising from a _ spontaneous reorganization of the doubly degenerate @xmath3 states due to the large jt coupling and quantum phonon dynamics_. this dynamically generated coexistence is qualitatively different from that of localized @xmath14 and extended @xmath75 electrons in rare earth solids , which has an atomic origin .",
    "we show below that for a wide range of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , both sets of states are partially occupied .",
    "this , we believe , underlies the ubiquitous two ` phase ' coexistence observed @xcite .",
    "the high sensitivity of the physical properties of manganites to small perturbations arises because the @xmath73 states , being localized and lattice distorted , are strongly influenced by local perturbations , which then affects the delicate relative stability of @xmath5 and @xmath6 states .",
    "finally , ( again as discussed in more detail below , ) the existence of the localized polaronic @xmath5 states _ in the presence of large @xmath10 and @xmath43 _ give rise to a _",
    "new , major , doping dependent ferromagnetic nearest neighbour exchange coupling _",
    "@xmath76 between the @xmath39 core spins .",
    "this comes about due to _ virtual , fast ( adiabatic ) _ hopping processes of the @xmath5 electrons to neighbouring empty sites and back , leading to a @xmath76 roughly of order @xmath77 , the intermediate state energy due to the unrelaxed lattice distortion being @xmath78 .",
    "we get @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "our calculations suggest that this _ virtual , correlated double exchange due to the localized @xmath5 electrons _ , and not conventional double exchange due to mobile @xmath3 electrons as hitherto believed , is the dominant source of ferromagnetism and of the ferromagnetic transition temperature @xmath16 in the hole doped manganites .",
    "based on the above ideas , and for the purposes of making quantitative calculations and predictions , we have proposed@xcite a new model hamiltonian for manganites given by @xmath81 here @xmath82 creates the jt polaronic state of energy @xmath83 and spin @xmath84 , localized at site @xmath85 ( @xmath86 is the corresponding destruction operator ) .",
    "the broad band electron , created by the operator @xmath87 , has mean energy zero , and nearest neighbour effective hopping amplitude @xmath66 .",
    "the two repel each other on site with energy @xmath10 .",
    "the common chemical potential @xmath88 is determined by the constraint that the filling , i.e. , the average number of @xmath3 electrons per site must be determined by the doping @xmath8 according to @xmath89    the term @xmath90 in eq .",
    "[ eqhlb ] models the spin dependent interactions , and is given by @xmath91 it includes the strong ferromagnetic hund s rule coupling @xmath43 between the @xmath3 spins @xmath92 and the ( spin @xmath93 ) @xmath39 spins @xmath94 , the net effective ferromagnetic exchange coupling @xmath76 between these @xmath39 spins ( from the mechanism alluded to above , and discussed in more detail below ) , and the interaction of the latter with an external magnetic field @xmath95 @xcite . for simplicity , in what follows we further approximate the @xmath39 spins as classical fixed length spins whose directions fluctuate , i.e. write @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a unit vector .",
    "we now discuss how the above model hamiltonian can be motivated from the microscopic hamiltonian for the manganites in the limit of strong jt interaction . a reasonably realistic microscopic model hamiltonian or energy operator @xmath72 of @xmath12 electrons ( @xmath3 and @xmath39 ) in the manganites has three types of contributions , namely those involving only the @xmath3 electrons ( @xmath98 ) , the coupling of these electrons with the jt lattice modes as well as the energy of these lattice modes themselves ( @xmath99 ) , and the part @xmath90 which involves the @xmath3 and @xmath39 spins .",
    "thus    @xmath100    where @xmath101    @xmath102    here the operators @xmath103 respectively add and remove an electron at site @xmath85 , in the spin state @xmath84 which can take two values , and in the two @xmath3 orbital states with labels @xmath104 corresponding to @xmath105 and @xmath106 corresponding to @xmath107 ; i.e. , @xmath108 is a short hand for @xmath109 .",
    "the number operator @xmath110 is the usual sum @xmath111 .",
    "the @xmath3 electron has site energy @xmath112 , equal to 0 for a clean system .",
    "the ( anisotropic and orbital dependent ) nearest neighbour hopping _ matrix _ is @xmath113 and @xmath10 is the repulsion between electrons at @xmath85 in different states .",
    "the first set of terms in @xmath114 describes the coupling of @xmath3 electrons with the two jt lattice modes @xmath115 and @xmath116 with strength @xmath41 , ( @xmath117 being the usual pauli matrices in orbital space ) the former displacement leading to a splitting and the latter to a mixing of the two @xmath3 states .",
    "the last two terms in @xmath118 are the potential and kinetic energies of the modes neglecting anharmonic and intersite terms .",
    "@xmath90 is the same magnetic hamiltonian as in eqn .",
    "[ eqhs ] ( except that , in the context of the microscopic hamiltonian , the @xmath3 spin @xmath119 @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the pauli spin operator ) .    in manganites",
    "the jt coupling @xmath41 is large compared to @xmath122 ( where @xmath56 is the typical size of the jt distortion ) , and one can first concentrate on the single site , coupled electron - phonon problem .",
    "the schrodinger equation corresponding to @xmath123 can be solved exactly at a single site .",
    "@xmath124 is like a local pseudo - magnetic field splitting the pseudo - spin @xmath125 orbital levels 1 and 2 , hence @xmath126 has eigenvalues @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the magnitude of the jt distortion .",
    "the diagonalization of @xmath126 can be done explicitly using the operators @xmath129 and @xmath130 where @xmath131 , i.e. , it determines the orientation of the jt distortion . when an electron is present at site @xmath85 in the @xmath132 state , the effective lattice potential energy at site @xmath85 in @xmath123 has the form @xmath133 this has a minimum at @xmath134 ( the jt polaronic distortion ) with an energy lowering of @xmath135 .5 ev independent of @xmath136 @xcite .",
    "the jt polaronic @xmath5 state that we referred to above is this @xmath137 state _ together with the jt distortion_. when an electron is present in the other ` anti ' jt , @xmath6 state , the effective lattice potential energy is @xmath138 with a minimum at zero displacement so that no distortion is associated with it .",
    "thus , when an @xmath5 polaron is present at a site , low energy lattice configurations around the deep minimum of @xmath139 involve a shift of @xmath140 by an amount @xmath56 at each site .",
    "this is formally achieved by a lang - firsov transformation @xcite @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the radial momentum operator conjugate to @xmath140 . in other words ,",
    "formally , one has @xmath143 .",
    "the huang - rhys reduction factor@xcite @xmath144 we have alluded to earlier , which multiplies the hopping involving the @xmath5 states , is just the ground state expectation value of @xmath145 , corresponding to the anti - adiabatic limit overlap of the distorted phonon wavefunction at a site with the undistorted phonon wavefunction .",
    "( we ignore fluctuations on the basis that @xmath146 @xcite ) .",
    "the coherent intersite hopping of the @xmath5 electrons is thus @xmath147 , very small , and can be neglected to a first approximation .",
    "the ` anti ' jahn teller state @xmath6 has no associated lattice distortion , so its hopping amplitude @xmath148 is not reduced , but depends on the angles @xmath136 and @xmath149 at sites @xmath85 and @xmath150 .",
    "we assume a nearest neighbour hopping amplitude @xmath151 averaged over angles @xmath136 either statistically ( and classically ) or by quantum fluctuations .",
    "such an _ orbital liquid _",
    "approximation is reasonable for the phases with no long range orbital order , i.e. , for @xmath152 in most manganites , but poor for those other values of @xmath8 for which one has strong orbital correlations or long range orbital order .",
    "the localized polaronic @xmath5 and the broad band @xmath6 states coexist in manganites since the conditions for anti - adiabaticity of the former , namely @xmath153 and the adiabaticity of the latter , namely @xmath154 , are _ both _ fulfilled .",
    "the @xmath6 electrons are repelled strongly by the @xmath5 electrons , with energy @xmath155 , and hence will have the largest amplitudes at sites where the @xmath5 electrons are not present , i.e. at the hole sites .",
    "they hop quickly ( time scale @xmath156 ) among such sites , avoiding strongly the sites with static @xmath5 electrons , where they hence have small amplitudes@xcite .",
    "finally we discuss the result alluded to above namely that the existence of localized , jt distorted @xmath5 states in the presence of large @xmath43 and large @xmath10 can give rise to a new mechanism of ferromagnetic exchange between the @xmath39 core spins , which we refer to as `` virtual double exchange '' .",
    "suppose that a localized @xmath5 electron is present at a site , and that site is distorted .",
    "the @xmath5 electron can take part in fast ( adiabatic ) virtual hopping processes to neighbouring sites , i.e. , leaving the local lattice distortion unrelaxed , by paying an energy cost of @xmath78 in the intermediate state . for large @xmath10",

    ". the @xmath158 factor comes from large @xmath43 , and the occupancy dependent terms from large @xmath69 . within the homogeneous orbital liquid approximation we are using in this paper",
    ", this translates to an effective ferromagnetic interaction proportional to @xmath159 as stated earlier .",
    "the normal super - exchange coupling between @xmath39 core spins on neighboring sites is of order @xmath160 , and its sign depends on the nearest neighbour orbital correlations @xcite . for example , in @xmath35 it is anti - ferromagnetic along the c axis , and ferromagnetic in plane .",
    "conventional double exchange can , in principle , explain metallic ferromagnetism in the manganites , but would be unable to account for ferromagnetism in their insulating phases in the absence of orbital correlations .",
    "the above mechanism yields a ferromagnetic coupling which is clearly much larger than and dominates the super - exchange for all intermediate doping , operates even in the insulating states and even in the orbital liquid phase , and as we discuss later , makes the dominant contribution to the ferromagnetic @xmath16 even in the metallic case .",
    "putting all this together , expressing the on site coulomb and exchange interactions in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 basis , and including the new exchange mechanism , leads us to the suggestion that in the large @xmath161 ) limit , and for describing low energy electronic properties the microscopic model hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ eqhmicro ] can be approximated by the much simpler , two fermion species , hamiltonian @xmath162 given in eq .",

    "apart from the constraint equation eq .",

    "more generally , it describes the dynamics of the @xmath6 electrons moving in an _ annealed disordered _ background of immobile @xmath5 electrons and @xmath39 spins in the presence of strong on site repulsion @xmath10 and hund s coupling @xmath43 , the annealed disorder distribution being _ thermodynamically and self - consistently determined_. this strong correlation problem can not be solved in general , but can be solved within the framework of dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite which is exact at @xmath167 , and is quite accurate for three dimensions .",
    "we have carried out these dmft calculations for thermodynamic properties ( the occupancies @xmath168 , @xmath169 , the magnetization @xmath170 , the specific heat , magnetic susceptibility , etc . ) , spectral behaviour ( eg . the @xmath6 band self - energy , propagator and density of states(dos ) ) and transport ( resistivity and magnetoresistance ) .",
    "while the specific results we discuss below come from such calculations , we believe that many of the physical mechanisms that underlie the results have a larger sphere of validity .",

    "essentially , the problem reduces to that of one site , with its local degrees of freedom and interactions , immersed in an effective medium ( comprising the other sites ) .",

    "this shift is due to the strong electron lattice coupling @xmath41 which makes the jt polaronic @xmath5 level possible and stabilizes it by an energy @xmath214 , and large @xmath10 , which makes the @xmath6 electron bandwidth vanish as @xmath213 . for @xmath219 , within dmft we can show@xcite that @xmath220 whence we obtain @xmath215 analytically as @xmath221 where @xmath222 is the bare half - width of the b - band .",
    "the decrease of @xmath215 with increasing @xmath222 and its numerical value for reasonable choices of @xmath214 and @xmath222 are in accord with experiments ( for example , as one goes from @xmath223 to @xmath224 which has a larger bandwidth ) .",
    "finite @xmath10 corrections to @xmath215 , which we have calculated , are small for @xmath225 which is appropriate to these systems .",

    "the system is metallic so that both @xmath6 and @xmath5 electronic states occupied . on increasing the temperature , the @xmath39 spin order decreases and the @xmath6 band narrows again , since due to double exchange @xcite the effective hopping amplitude of the @xmath6 electrons decreases .",
    "the spectral weight for the down spin polarization also turns on , reflecting the reduction in the magnetization from its zero temperature value .",
    "the sequence of figures 3a to 3c illustrates this progression .",
    "eventually , both up and down spin spectral functions become equal , and the @xmath6 band bottom crosses the @xmath5 level and moves up as @xmath9 rises beyond @xmath16 (= 208 k in the present context , see fig .",
    "3c ) where ferromagnetism disappears , and the system becomes a paramagnetic insulator as in fig .",
    "3d , with @xmath6 states occupied thermally across a gap .",
    "we thus have a simple picture of the thermal ferromagnetic - metal to paramagnetic - insulator transition .",
    "there are very few calculations @xcite of the transport properties of manganites though this is one of their main unusual features . within the dmft for our model",

    "[ fig - res - cmr ]    we see that the resistivity of the paramagnetic insulating state is fairly well described by the theory . in this phase ,",
    "the conducting @xmath6 band is only thermally occupied . the effective electrical gap @xmath233 ( the experimental value is @xmath234@xcite ) . the positive feedback between the thermally excited , strongly @xmath9 dependent number @xmath235 of @xmath6 electrons , and the double exchange broadening of the @xmath6 band as @xmath9 decreases , leads to a very rapid decrease and closure of the electrical gap just below @xmath16 and the consequent rapid decrease in the resistivity just below @xmath16 as in experiment to a rather large value @xmath236 .",
    "but we note that the calculated resistivity does not decrease much thereafter down to @xmath166 , unlike experiments , where @xmath237 decreases to residual values of @xmath238 below about @xmath239 .",
    "we believe that the latter is due to inter - site @xmath5 coherence , neglected here ( see later ) .",
    "we also show in the fig .",
    "[ fig - res - cmr ] the resistivity in a field of @xmath240 for @xmath241 .",
    "we clearly see cmr .",
    "the external magnetic field polarizes the @xmath39 spins , and via @xmath242 increases the @xmath6 band width which reduces the electrical gap .",
    "cmr arises because resistivity depends exponentially on the gap .",
    "the effect is largest near @xmath16 as the change in the magnetization due to a given magnetic field is the largest there .",
    "as our mean field approximation for the curie transition neglects short range magnetic order above @xmath16 , @xmath229 is somewhat overestimated and the cmr somewhat underestimated .",
    "the properties of manganites vary strongly and characteristically with the ionic species @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the material systematics of such variation , eg . , in the thermal imt as well as the cmr depend in our model largely and sensitively on the ratio @xmath243 and somewhat on the @xmath222 and @xmath76 . a small increase in @xmath244",
    "reduces the high temperature resistivity @xmath245 enormously , as is clear in fig .",
    "[ fig - res - cmr ] where we have increased @xmath222 from 1.05 to 1.15 @xmath45 and @xmath246 from 52.7 to 60.2 @xmath247 to fit @xmath16 and @xmath248 for @xmath249 .",
    "broadly this is because the density of current carrying @xmath6 electrons and hence @xmath250 depends exponentially on @xmath251 .",
    "this is also the general reason for the observed large variation of @xmath252 and @xmath16 with strain and pressure .    making the reasonable assumption that @xmath214 , a single octahedron quantity , is roughly unchanged across materials , but that @xmath246 , the effective ferromagnetic exchange , scales as @xmath253 , we have calculated properties as a function of @xmath222 for @xmath254 .",
    "we find that @xmath16 is typically fairly close to the ( curie - weiss ) value ( @xmath255 ) ( and hence increases as @xmath256 as @xmath222 increases ) , with a slight enhancement due to a nonzero @xmath257 and double exchange . with increasing @xmath222 , the resistive transition on lowering @xmath9 through @xmath16 changes from insulator - insulator to insulator - metal , and then to metal - metal .",
    "these trends are seen experimentally @xcite as a function of increasing cation radius @xmath258 , which is known to roughly track the bandwidth @xmath222 .",
    "we also find that the relative cmr , defined as @xmath259/r(h)$ ] , depends exponentially on @xmath16 ( increasing as @xmath16 decreases ) .",
    "this is indeed the behaviour extracted from measurements on several systems @xcite .",
    "the observed unusually large dependence of @xmath16 and of the resistivity at @xmath16 on pressure @xcite in @xmath260 is reproduced if we assume that @xmath222 increases with pressure at a realistic rate of about .01 @xmath261 .",
    "a more detailed discussion of these finite temperature results and material trends is presented in @xcite .",
    "a key feature of our theory is the result mentioned above that the dominant contribution to @xmath16 comes from virtual double exchange of the localized @xmath5 polarons and not from conventional double exchange , since the mobile carrier density ( @xmath262 ) is very small .",
    "interestingly , the precipitous , universal and nearly linear drop in @xmath16 with local ion size variance reported by attfield@xcite in a variety of multi - component manganites is much larger than what is expected from a simple double exchange picture . in the double exchange mechanism",
    ", @xmath16 is proportional to @xmath148 which depends on the @xmath263 bond angle @xmath264 , which is strongly affected by the local ion - sizes , as @xmath265 .",
    "the variance in @xmath264 , namely @xmath266 is at most 10 degrees , so that one expects that the resulting reduction in @xmath16 is @xmath267 .",
    "the observed reduction is an order of magnitude larger !",
    "we believe that such a large reduction is however understandable within our theory if we extend the calculations described above to include the effect of ion size variance on @xmath214 , and @xmath268 hybridization effects as discussed in section 8 .",
    "we now illustrate through three examples how other unusual properties of manganites can be understood in our approach .",
    "specifically , we consider the anomalously low carrier density as inferred from optical conductivity in the metallic phase @xcite , the small electronic specific heat @xcite and the electron hole asymmetry @xcite .      in the metallic regime @xmath269 , one can estimate @xmath270 , the effective density of carriers , from the the drude weight i.e. the frequency integral of the real part of the optical conductivity @xmath271 . in a free electron like limit , this integral is @xmath272 where @xmath273 is the density of carriers , and @xmath274 is the band optical mass .",
    "since there is no evidence for enhancement of @xmath274 with respect to the band mass ( eg . see ref.@xcite ) , results for @xmath275@xcite lead to @xmath276 for @xmath277 and @xmath166 .",
    "the expected value ( for a doped mott insulator ) is @xmath278 .",
    "although there are several uncertainties in inferring @xmath270 precisely from @xmath279 , its reduction by nearly an order of magnitude , and even more so its observed strong decrease with temperature on the scale of @xmath16 which is much less than the ( normal ) fermi temperature , are puzzling .",
    "but the results are easily understood in our model , since the low frequency @xmath280 is due to @xmath6 electrons . as seen from fig .",
    "( 2c ) at @xmath166 there are indeed very few electrons in the @xmath6 band , all near its bottom , below the @xmath5 ( or fermi ) level .",
    "the dmft calculation with parameters appropriate for @xmath281 at @xmath282 , namely @xmath283 ( and consequently @xmath284 ) , leads to @xmath285 , and a decrease with temperature which is very similar to what is seen in experiment .      the low @xmath9 electronic specific heat in manganites ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) goes as @xmath286 with a @xmath287 nearly independent of @xmath8 , unlike other doped mott insulators(eg ref .",
    "@xcite ) and has a value expected for a tight binding band with bandwidth @xmath288 . in polaron theories with @xmath289 polarons per site @xmath290 in the classical gas limit , and @xmath291 , where @xmath292 is the effective bandwidth , for @xmath293 . neither of these",
    "is observed and this is often argued to be evidence against small polarons in manganites . in our model , although the electrons are mostly jt polarons , we expect that they will make very little contribution to the low temperature specific heat .",
    "for , being localized they will strongly couple to disorder potentials and affected by coulomb interactions , and we expect that their entropy will be frozen out at a large temperature scale . we find that @xmath287 ( calculated in the paramagnetic metallic phase to avoid large magnetic contributions to the specific heat ) is about @xmath294 with the parameters used above for @xmath295 . the value for a band of width @xmath296 is about @xmath297 .",
    "the physical reason for the smaller @xmath287 is that the few @xmath6 electrons which are present occupy states near the bottom of the @xmath6 band with energy close to @xmath83 , and the density of states there is relatively smaller(fig .",
    "2c ) .      the electronic and magnetic properties of hole doped @xmath298 and `` electron doped '' ( @xmath299 ) manganites are very different .",
    "for example , the latter are much more metallic than the former in the paramagnetic phase @xcite ( although the af or charge ordered phases can be insulating for other reasons ) .",
    "this behaviour is unexpected in a one orbital strong coupling antiadiabatic polaron model since for low @xmath3 carrier density the dilute small polaron assembly will form an insulator , as also in a model with only @xmath242 , where there is electron hole symmetry .",
    "it is often stated that polaronic effects are not seen for @xmath3 orbitals in the @xmath300 doped regime because the jt coupling becomes weaker as @xmath301 .",
    "this seems unlikely given the local nature of the jt interaction and the stability of the ( @xmath302 ) octahedron .",
    "the metallic nature of the @xmath300 doped regime which has low @xmath3 density is natural in our theory because for large @xmath8 the effectively uncorrelated @xmath6 electrons form a wide band whose bottom is occupied by the small number of @xmath3 electrons , and the @xmath5 states are unoccupied , as depicted in fig .",
    "this fact also explains why pure band models are fairly successful@xcite in describing the magnetic ground states in the the @xmath300 doped limit .",
    "in summary , we have presented here a new model of coexisting localized jt polarons and broad band electrons for manganites , argued that it arises inevitably in the presence of orbital degeneracy and strong jt coupling , and shown that it explains a wide variety of characteristic properties of manganites . in this concluding section",
    "we compare our theory with some of the other theories , discuss some of the inadequacies of the present model and extensions to overcome these .",
    "we believe that a more general treatment of the model eq . [ eqhlb ] with some extensions can lead to a complete description of manganites .",
    "two examples , namely inclusion of spatial correlations and of intersite @xmath5 state coherence are discussed below .    to begin with , we note that the picture developed here is very different from that in other polaronic models , which either neglect @xmath3 orbital degeneracy @xcite or work in the adiabatic approximation @xcite . in the former , for example , at high temperatures transport is due to the activated hopping of localized small polarons . in the latter ( adiabatic ) models ,",
    "the polarons also form a broad band , whence it is difficult to obtain a paramagnetic insulator to ferromagnetic metal transition say at @xmath254 . furthermore",
    ", small polarons disappear below @xmath16 even for large @xmath41 , the drude weight is not small , and there is no isotope effect , all in disagreement with experiment . in both , it is argued that small polarons are likely only at high temperatures , and that small and large polarons coexist only in a narrow range of @xmath8 and @xmath9 determined by the effective electron phonon coupling and that there are no small polarons at low @xmath9 .    in our theory ,",
    "the carriers are broad band electrons thermally promoted out of localized jt polaronic states .",
    "small jt polarons ( in the anti - adiabatic limit , with negligible bandwidth ) and band states(in the adiabatic limit ) necessarily coexist over a wide range of @xmath8 @xmath303 say ) _ and for all _ @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast , in single orbital polaron models , there is a crossover with increasing dimensionless electron phonon coupling @xmath304 from large to small polarons , so that the two can occur together only over a narrow range of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    _",
    "an unusual feature of the polaron level in our model is that it has no prominent thermodynamic or spectroscopic ( sharp level ) manifestations . _",
    "firstly as pointed out above , it does not lead to a large electronic specific heat as we expect that their entropy will be frozen out at energy scales determined by coulomb and impurity interactions not explicitly included in our model .",
    "the remaining linear specific heat for the @xmath6 band metal , is roughly of the size seen experimentally@xcite .",
    "secondly , no sharp @xmath5 like spectral feature is to be expected .",
    "rather , the @xmath5 excitation spectrum will be an incoherent continuum , starting from a weak ( weight @xmath305 ) anti - adiabatic low energy part building up to adiabatic ( franck - condon ) higher energy features , as the fast removal of an @xmath5 electron leads to highly excited lattice states ( energy @xmath306 ) . indeed , optical conductivity data in manganites do show@xcite such an incoherent continuum which is largely independent of temperature , and we believe that this is their origin .    in our theory",
    "presented earlier we made the simple approximation that the local @xmath64 distortion @xmath307 is independent of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and that its large value is determined entirely by on - site properties , namely the electron @xmath64 phonon coupling @xmath41 and the phonon mode force constant @xmath308 .",
    "this is probably valid for high temperatures not too far below @xmath16 and for @xmath309 .",
    "however , jt polaronic effects can become dynamical and unobservable at low @xmath9 for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the local lattice kinetic energy has a term @xmath310 where @xmath307 is the magnitude , and @xmath136 the direction or orientation , of the local jt distortion .",
    "hence @xmath136 , which also determines the orbital mixing amplitudes of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 states , rotates due to quantum fluctuations , although due to anharmonicity and crystallinity , the rotation could be hindered and slow . a second ,",
    "perhaps more important , source of this dynamical @xmath311 effect is the quantum mechanical intersite @xmath5 state coherence which makes the @xmath136 ill defined .",
    "the energy scale for the latter , @xmath312 , is consistent with the widely observed @xcite reduction or disappearance of static or of long time scale local @xmath64 distortion in metallic manganites as their temperature decreases well below 125k .",
    "finally , intersite @xmath5 coherence , especially hybridization with energetically degenerate broad band @xmath6 states in the metallic regime , will reduce @xmath307 and broaden the @xmath5 band .",
    "the two effects feed back on each other , and it is in principle possible that small polarons may weaken and disappear altogether at low temperatures in the metallic phase rather than merely becoming dynamic . we have not explored this possibility here .",
    "intersite @xmath5 state coherence can be included in our model by adding to eq.(1 ) an @xmath268 hybridization term @xmath313 $ ] where @xmath314 , and @xmath315 .",
    "we expect that its inclusion , and the consequent development of long range intersite @xmath5 state coherence at low temperatures will , in addition , lead to the observed smooth decrease @xcite in the electrical resistivity of clean metallic manganites from about @xmath316 just below @xmath16 to a small value , @xmath317 , as @xmath318 past a characteristic crossover temperature of about 100k , of the same scale as @xmath319 . in the dmft calculations presented above ,",
    "the residual resistivity at @xmath166 due to random scattering from the incoherent @xmath5 sites is too large , @xmath320 ( fig.3 ) .",
    "if the @xmath5 states become coherent , the @xmath6 electron scattering and the consequent resistivity would then vanish at @xmath166 , and is nonzero only if static disorder is present .",
    "this can lead to a metallic state with a small residual resistivity or to an anderson localized insulating state depending on the amount of disorder .",
    "we believe that the giant isotope effect observed in manganites @xcite is another dramatic consequence of the @xmath268 hybridization scale @xmath321 and its exponential dependence on the inverse square root of the isotopic mass . for it can add , via ( conventional ) double exchange , to the ferromagnetic @xmath16 an amount roughly given by @xmath322 for @xmath323 where @xmath324 is less than one . because of the huang rhys factor in @xmath319 , which depends exponentially on square root of the isotopic mass , we find that @xmath325 so that for @xmath326 the difference @xmath327 , close to the observed value@xcite .",
    "in addition to the neglect of intersite coherence effects discussed above , we have also neglected in our theory spatial correlations between the local electron densities @xmath328 and @xmath329 , as well as between the local angles @xmath330 .",
    "this may be adequate for the phases which correspond to _ homogenous orbital liquids_. however , many phenomena in manganites such as short range order , long range charge / orbital order ( or _ orbital solidification _ ) , various types of antiferromagnetism @xcite and mesoscale structures @xcite depend on spatial correlations . to treat these we need to add to eq .",
    "( 1 ) a number of more complicated longer range coulomb , anharmonic , steric , elastic , magneto - elastic , etc .",
    "interactions that couple spin , orbital and lattice degrees of freedom to each other , and to strain , ion size mismatch , disorder , etc . as appropriate .",
    "a self consistent determination of long or short range order in @xmath331 ( a new ` internal ' variable)@xcite , @xmath136 and @xmath332 , and their effects on the @xmath6 electron dynamics for different @xmath8 and @xmath9 , in the presence of such interactions can lead to a complete description of manganites including the above phenomena , and others such as first order transitions , two phase co - existence , etc .. we hope to discuss these elsewhere .    a significant general question raised by our work is that of the detailed nature of adiabatic to non adiabatic crossover as @xmath41 increases , and the conditions for the _ coexistence of adiabatic and antiadiabatic states with exponentially separated dynamical timescales_. we have shown that the latter leads to new phenomena , argued that this happens in manganites because of the large @xmath41 , and have developed the consequences in a simple model assuming this separation .",
    "the results closely correspond with a wide variety of observations .",
    "it would be of great interest to explore such a crossover and time - scale or energy - scale separation experimentally and theoretically in the many systems such as organic solids , transition metal oxides and chemical ( molecular ) systems , which have degenerate orbitals and strong symmetry breaking jt couplings .",

    "<S> here we show that the strong jahn teller coupling between the twofold degenerate ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) @xmath3 orbitals of @xmath4 and lattice modes of vibration ( of the oxygen octahedra surrounding the @xmath4 ions ) dynamically reorganizes the former into a set of states ( which we label @xmath5 ) which are localized with large local lattice distortion and exponentially small intersite overlap , and another set ( labelled @xmath6 ) which form a broad band . </S>",
    "<S> this hitherto unsuspected but microscopically inevitable @xmath7 of radically different @xmath5 and @xmath6 states , and their relative energies and occupation as influenced by doping @xmath8 , temperature @xmath9 , local coulomb repulsion @xmath10 etc . , underlies the unique effects seen in manganites . </S>",
