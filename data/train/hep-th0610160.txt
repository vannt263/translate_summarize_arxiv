    "this destroys usual perturbative renormalization .",
    "the problem of restoring the symmetries , broken by the regularization on the lf , and proving the equivalence of usual and lf quantizations is rather difficult .",
    "nevertheless it can be solved , at least perturbatively @xcite ( and to all orders in coupling constant @xcite ) via comparison of two feynman perturbation theories : one generated by usual and one by lf quantizations .",
    "such a comparison shows the necessity of adding to regularized canonical lf hamiltonian unusual `` counterterms '' which restore the mentioned equivalence in perturbation theory in the limit of removing the regularization .",
    "the `` zero '' modes ( i.e. @xmath8 modes ) and modes with @xmath10 in the vicinity of @xmath8 may be important for the description of nonperturbative vacuum effects like condensates .",

    "fermion mass @xmath45 ( in fact , dimensionless parameter @xmath46 ) plays the role of coupling constant .",

    "it is possible to show that @xmath75    it is remarkable that the `` counterterm '' ( which restores the equivalence with formulation in lorentz coordinates in boson form of @xmath68 ) , being proportional to @xmath76 , exactly coincides with corresponding ( proportional to @xmath76 ) canonical term of the @xmath68 in the fermion form .",

    "any bound state with @xmath81 and fixed finite value of the @xmath82 can be described in terms of fermion fock space ( formed with @xmath83 acting on the vacuum @xmath60 ) . owing to the positivity of the spectrum of the @xmath7 for these states ( which are taken to be orthogonal to the vacuum ) , the hamiltonian @xmath68 on this subspace can be represented by finite dimensional matrix .",
    "one can calculate the spectrum of mass @xmath84 numerically for different integer @xmath85 .",

    "we have found good agreement @xcite with lattice calculations in lorentz coordinates for @xmath87 at any @xmath46 , see fig .  1 , and for @xmath88 at small @xmath46 ( for larger @xmath46 we see the behaviour of the spectrum , indicating possible phase transition , that is seen also in mentioned lattice calculations ) , see fig .  2 .",
    "on the fig .  1 we use normalized value @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the mass of lowest bound state .    beside of",
    "that we have calculated the spectrum for any other values of the parameter @xmath91 ( or for @xmath92 ) that was not yet done with lattice in lorentz coordinates .",
    "we have found for all nonzero @xmath91 some `` critical '' region of @xmath46 where the mass spectrum becomes unbounded from the bottom .",
    "this indicates that the perturbation theory in @xmath46 , that we used in our analysis , fails at these `` critical '' values of @xmath46 .",
    "it is very interesting problem to find a way to continue our lf hamiltonian to `` nonperturbative '' in @xmath46 region .",
    "let us consider only lf hamiltonian obtained perturbatively to all orders in @xmath46 .",
    "we can formally find some lagrangian , that generates this hamiltonian via canonical formulation on the lf . assuming that this lagrangian is the ordinary one plus some counterterms , it is easy to find that these counterterms must be such that only the constraint , which connects @xmath93 and @xmath94 components of bispinor field @xmath35 , should be modified . in naive canonical formulation of qed(1 + 1 ) on the lf such constraint has the following form : @xmath95 being the one of components of dirac equation . ``",
    "zero '' mode of the @xmath93 is unconstrainted by this equation .    for our dlcq formulation with antiperiodic in @xmath6 fields",
    "@xmath73 we introduce the following modification of this constraint : @xmath96 here the @xmath93 has no zero mode because of antiperiodic boundary conditions .",
    "now one can construct modified qed(1 + 1 ) lagrangian , that generates this form of the constraint .",
    "having such a lagrangian one can construct corresponding lf hamiltonian and substitute the solution of the constraint w.r.t .",

    "we come back to abovementioned form of corrected lf hamiltonian .",
    "the expression for the @xmath93 , respecting our modified constraint , includes the operator @xmath97 .",
    "taking into account the properties of this operator , we can check that correct values of vacuum condensate parameters , can be get on the lf using lf vacuum @xmath60 for corresponding vevs : @xmath98",
    "the remark at the end of previous section implies a possible way of semiphenomenological introduction of vacuum parameters in qcd(3 + 1 ) on the lf .",
    "namely , we can assume similar modification of the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional analog of the constraint equation , relating the @xmath93 and the @xmath94 on the lf , using the same dlcq formulation . to make this correctly one has to introduce a lattice with respect to transverse coordinates .",
    "here we only describe the idea .",
