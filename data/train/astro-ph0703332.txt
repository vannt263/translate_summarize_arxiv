    "stellar bars are observed in a substantial fraction of nearby disk galaxies ( knapen et al .",
    "2000 ; eskridge et al .",
    "2000 ; marinova & jogee 2006 ) .",
    "their growth is partly regulated by the exchange of angular momentum with the stellar disk and the dark matter ( dm ) halo .",
    "for this reason the dynamical evolution of bars can be used to constrain the distribution of dm in the inner regions of galaxy disks .",
    "using perturbation theory weinberg ( 1985 ) predicted that a bar would lose angular momentum to a massive dm halo through dynamical friction , slowing down in the process .",
    "this prediction was subsequently confirmed in @xmath6-body simulations ( debattista & sellwood 1998 , 2000 ; athanassoula 2003 ; oneill & dubinski 2003 ; sellwood & debattista 2006 ) .",
    "they found that bars are slowed efficiently within a few rotation periods if a substantial density of dm is present in the region of the bar . on the other hand , if the mass distribution is dominated by the stellar disk throughout the inner few disk scale - lengths , then the bar remains rapidly rotating ( here defined as the bar ending just inside its corotation radius ) for a long time .",
    "thus the accurate measurement of the bar pattern speed , @xmath7 , provides a way to discriminate whether the central regions of the host galaxy are dominated by baryons or by dm .",
    "bar pattern speeds are most usefully parametrized by the distance - independent ratio @xmath8 , where @xmath0 is the corotation radius and @xmath1 the semi - major axis of the bar .",
    "bars which end near corotation ( @xmath9 ) are termed fast , while shorter bars ( @xmath10 ) are said to be slow . the best way to determine",
    "the bar rotation parameter @xmath11 is by measuring @xmath7 with the model - independent method developed by tremaine & weinberg ( 1984 , hereafter tw ) .",
    "to date this method has been used to measure @xmath7 of mainly massive ( @xmath12 ) early - type barred galaxies ( see corsini 2004 and references therein ) and it has been successfully tested against @xmath6-body simulations ( debattista 2003 ; oneill & dubinski 2003 ) .",
    "all measured bars are compatible with being fast , implying that the inner regions of these galaxies are not dominated by dm .",
    "the only exception appears to be the slow bar in ngc  2915 , a blue compact dwarf galaxy , for which the tw method was applied to h  i radio synthesis data ( bureau et al .",
    "1999 ) .    the minimum possible amount of dm in disk galaxies can be determined from the rotation curve , by scaling up the mass - to - light ratios of the luminous components to fit the central velocity gradient ( see bosma 1999 for a review ) .",
    "however , the lack of any obvious transition region from the bulge / disk - dominated to the halo - dominated part of rotation curves severely limits the ability to obtain a unique decomposition and derive the central dm distribution ( e.g. , corsini et al .",
    "the structure of dm halos is more directly revealed in galaxies where the luminous components are thought to give a nearly zero contribution to the mass budget , because this makes mass modeling easier and the derived dm distribution less uncertain .",
    "for this reason dwarf galaxies were considered ideal targets for studying the properties of dm halos and for testing if they have a central cuspy power - law mass density distribution as predicted by cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology ( navarro et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ; moore et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "however , recent extensive studies have shown that in most of them the contribution of the stellar disk can account for the inner rotation curve and dm halos with a constant - density core provide a better fit to than those with a density cusp ( e.g. , de blok & bosma 2002 ; swaters et al .",
    "2003 ; spekkens et al . 2005 ) .",
    "nonetheless , the interpretation of these results has been controversial because of possible observational systematic effects , such as the poor spatial resolution of radio maps ( van den bosch & swaters 2001 ) and slit misplacement in optical spectroscopy ( swaters et al .",
    "2003 ) as well as non - circular ( hayashi & navarro 2006 ) , and off - plane gas motions ( swaters et al . 2003b ; valenzuela et al . 2005 ) .",
    "since measurements of pattern speeds with the tw method do not require high spatial resolution or slits passing exactly through the galaxy center and refers to the stellar component only , such a measurement in a dwarf disk galaxy can test unambiguously for the presence of a dense dm cusp . in the present letter we attempt such a measurement for ngc  4431 .",
    "ngc  4431 ( vcc 1010 ) is a small ( @xmath13 [ de vaucouleurs et al . 1991 , hereafter rc3 ] ) and faint ( @xmath14 [ rc3 ] ) nucleated dwarf galaxy ( binggeli et al . 1985 ) classified as dsb0/a by barazza et al .",
    "( 2002 ) following an unsharp mask analysis of the galaxy .",
    "the presence of a bar had earlier been missed by virtue of the galaxy s low luminosity and the relatively small angle between the bar s and disk s position angle ( pa ) . both the presence of a strong bar and trailing arms ( which are clearly visible in fig . 3 of barazza et al .",
    "2002 ) and the rotationally - supported kinematics ( simien & prugniel 2002 ; pedraz et al .",
    "2002 ) are indicative of a genuine disk galaxy .",
    "the total absolute magnitude of the galaxy is @xmath15 corrected for inclination and extinction ( rc3 ) and adopting a distance of 16.2 mpc ( jerjen et al .",
    "it is located close to the center of the virgo cluster at a projected distance of @xmath16 kpc from m  87 .",
    "its closest neighbor in projection is the de6/ds0 galaxy ngc 4436 , at a projected separation of @xmath17 or @xmath18 kpc .",
    "deep broad - band imaging of ngc  4431 was carried out with the very large telescope ( vlt ) at the european southern observatory on april 1 , 2000 as part of a project aimed at measuring distances , metallicities , and ages of dwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "details of observations , data reduction , and analysis are reported elsewhere ( barazza et al . 2003 ; jerjen et al . 2004 ) .",
    "we analyzed the @xmath19band image of ngc  4431 obtained by barazza et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , with foreground stars and background galaxies subtracted .",
    "we fitted ellipses to galaxy isophotes with the iraf task ellipse , after masking the northeastern part of the image to minimize the light contamination from ngc 4436 , the outskirts of which fall in the field of view of the image .",
    "we first fitted ellipses allowing their centers to vary to test whether patchy dust obscuration and tidal deformations were present .",
    "having found no evidence of varying ellipse centers within the errors of the fits for the inner @xmath20 we concluded that in these regions there is little or uniform obscuration and no tidal deformations , and that the galaxy is a viable candidate for the tw method . at larger radii",
    ", the shift of ellipse centers ( @xmath21 ) of ngc 4431 in the direction of ngc 4436 may be due to the interaction between the two galaxies .",
    "the ellipse fits were then repeated with the ellipse center fixed and the resulting surface brightness profile is plotted in fig .",
    "the inclination ( @xmath22 ) and disk pa ( @xmath23 ) were determined by averaging the values measured between @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "they are consistent within the errors with values obtained by fitting ellipses with free centers .",
    "we measured @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "1 ) using four independent methods based on fourier amplitudes ( aguerri et al .",
    "2000 ) , fourier and ellipse phases ( debattista et al . 2002 ) , and a parametric decomposition of the surface brightness profile ( prieto et al .",
    "the mean of the resulting values is our best estimate of @xmath1 and we assume the largest deviation from the mean as our error estimate ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the bar length is in agreement with the radius where the spiral arms seen in the unsharp mask image of barazza et al .",
    "( 2002 ) start .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of ngc 4431 were carried out in service mode at vlt on may 4 - 6 , 2003 ( run 1 ) , april 21 - 22 , 2004 ( run 2 ) and may 18 - 23 , 2004 ( run 3 ) .",
    "the focal reducer low dispersion spectrograph 2 ( fors2 ) mounted the volume - phased holographic grism gris_1400v@xmath2718 with 1400 @xmath28 and the @xmath29 slit .",
    "the detector was a mosaic of 2 mit / ll ccds .",
    "each ccd had @xmath30 pixels of @xmath31 @xmath32m@xmath33 .",
    "the wavelength range from 4560 to 5860   was covered with a reciprocal dispersion of 0.645   pixel@xmath34 and a spatial scale of 0.250 arcsec pixel@xmath34 after a @xmath35 pixel binning .",
    "we obtained spectra with the slit at @xmath36 crossing the galaxy center ( @xmath37 minutes in run 1 ) and offset by @xmath38 eastward ( @xmath39 minutes in run 3 ) .",
    "we also obtained spectra with the slit at @xmath40 and shifted by @xmath38 eastward ( @xmath41 minutes in run 2 ; @xmath41 minutes in run 3 ) and westward ( @xmath42 minutes in run 3 ) with respect to the galaxy nucleus .",
    "two different pas were chosen for the slits to test for the sensitivity of the tw measurement to the @xmath43 uncertainty in @xmath44 .",
    "comparison lamp exposures obtained for each observing night ensured accurate wavelength calibrations .",
    "spectra of g and k giant stars served as kinematical templates .",
    "the average seeing fwhm was @xmath45 in run 1 , @xmath46 in run 2 , and @xmath47 in run 3 . using standard midas routines , all the spectra were bias subtracted , flat - field corrected , cleaned of cosmic rays , corrected for bad pixels , and wavelength calibrated as in debattista et al .",
    "the accuracy of the wavelength rebinning ( @xmath48 ) was checked by measuring wavelengths of the brightest night - sky emission lines .",
    "the instrumental resolution was @xmath49   ( fwhm ) corresponding to @xmath50  at 5170  .",
    "the spectra obtained in the same run along the same position were co - added using the center of the stellar continuum as reference . in the resulting spectra the sky contribution was determined by interpolating along the outermost @xmath51 at the edges of the slit and then subtracted .",
    "to measure the pattern speed of the bar , @xmath7 , we used the tw method . for slits parallel to the disk major - axis",
    ", this relates the luminosity - weighted mean position , @xmath52 , to the luminosity - weighted mean velocity @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the galaxy inclination .",
    "to measure @xmath55 for each slit , we first collapsed the two - dimensional spectrum along its spatial direction between @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the wavelength range between 5220 and 5540  , obtaining a one - dimensional spectrum .",
    "the value of @xmath55 was then derived by fitting the resulting spectrum with the convolution of the spectrum of the g0iii star sao119458 and a gaussian line - of - sight velocity profile by means of the fourier correlation quotient method ( bender 1990 , hereafter fcq ) as done in aguerri et al .",
    "( 2003 , hereafter adc03 ) .",
    "we estimated uncertainties by monte carlo simulations with photon , read - out and sky noise .",
    "as a precision check we analyzed separately the two eastward - offset spectra ( @xmath58 ) which were obtained with the slit at @xmath40 in run 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the two resulting estimates of @xmath55 are in agreement within the errors ( fig .",
    "2 ) . to compute @xmath52 for each slit , we extracted the luminosity profile from the @xmath19band image along the position of the slit after convolving the image to the seeing of the spectrum .",
    "the @xmath19band profile matches very well that obtained by collapsing the spectrum along the wavelength direction , supporting that the slit was placed as intended .",
    "we used the @xmath19band profiles to compute @xmath52 because they are less noisy than those extracted from the spectra , particularly at large radii . by comparing the slits at @xmath40 and at @xmath59 we also verified that the error introduced by the @xmath60 uncertainty in disk pa is small for both @xmath52 and @xmath55 .",
    "we obtained @xmath7 by fitting a straight line to the values of @xmath52 and @xmath55 to the data for slits at @xmath61 and @xmath62 and at @xmath63 and @xmath36 ( fig .",
    "although the @xmath63 slit was obtained at different pa , this slit constrains only the zero point ( i.e. , systemic ) velocity and any slit passing through the center can be used .",
    "this gives @xmath64  arcsec@xmath34 ( @xmath65  kpc@xmath34 ) .",
    "we used the fcq to measure the line - of - sight velocity curve and velocity dispersion profile of the stellar component along the major axis ( fig .",
    "3 ) . our measurements at @xmath40 are in agreement within errors with those by simien & prugniel ( 2002 ) at @xmath66 .",
    "we derived the circular velocity in the disk region , @xmath67 , after a standard correction for the asymmetric drift as in adc03 .",
    "this value is in agreement with the circular velocity derived from the tully - fisher relation calculated in the @xmath19band by courteau ( 1997 ) .",
    "thus the corotation radius of the bar is @xmath68 and the ratio of the corotation radius to the bar semi - major axis @xmath69 .",
    "the error intervals on @xmath0 and @xmath11 are @xmath3 confidence level and were measured with monte carlo simulations as in adc03 . by excluding the possibility that @xmath70 as this is thought to be unphysical ( contopoulos 1980 ) we estimated that the probability that the bar ends close to its corotation radius ( i.e. , @xmath71 ) is @xmath72 .",
    "this was calculated via monte carlo simulations by assuming a uniform distribution of @xmath73 and @xmath74 and gaussian distribution of @xmath7 within their error ranges .",
    "by measuring the bar pattern speed of ngc  4431 we have demonstrated that the tw method is feasible using stars as tracer for dwarf galaxies . so far , this technique has been applied only to bright barred galaxies with the result that all the measured bars are consistent with being rapidly rotating ( see corsini 2004 for a review ) . for ngc 4431",
    "we find a bar suggestive of being fast at @xmath72 probability , although the measurement uncertainties in this galaxy preclude a stronger statement .",
    "as discussed by debattista ( 2003 ) and debattista & williams ( 2004 ) , the tw measurement of @xmath7 is particularly sensitive to errors in the pa@xmath75 .",
    "however , this is unlike to be an issue for ngc  4431 .",
    "in fact , the values of @xmath52 and @xmath55 measured in the offset position at @xmath58 from the spectrum at @xmath36 are in agreement within the errors with those from the two spectra at @xmath40 .",
    "so , the fact that the value of the bar speed parameter of ngc  4431 is nominally less than unity can not be attributed to the uncertainty on pa@xmath75 but to the scatter in the values of @xmath52 and @xmath55 .",
    "a fast bar in ngc  4431 would suggest a common formation mechanism of the bar both in bright and dwarf galaxies .",
    "if disks were previously stabilized by massive dm halos , we exclude that these bars were produced by tidal interactions because they would be slowly rotating ( noguchi 1999 ) .",
    "but , this is not the case even for galaxies , like ngc  4431 and the sb0 ngc  1023 ( debattista et al . 2002 ) which show signs of weak interaction with a close companion , without being significantly perturbed .",
    "this finding allows us to conclude that there is no difference between tw measurements in isolated or mildly interacting barred galaxies ( adc03 ; corsini et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "according to high - resolution @xmath6-body simulations of bars in cosmologically motivated , cdm halos ( see debattista 2006 for a review ) a fast bar would imply that ngc  4431 has a massive disk and does not reside inside a centrally - concentrated dm halo .",
    "this is in agreement with other studies of dwarf galaxies ( swaters 1999 ; de blok et al .",
    "2001 ; mcgaugh et al .",
    "2001 ; de blok & bosma 2002 ; marchesini et al . 2002 ; swaters et al . 2003 ; spekkens et al . 2005 ) who analyzed the ionized - gas rotation curves of up to about @xmath76 objects . by assuming minimal disks and spherical symmetry most of the data are better described by dm halos with an inner density core rather than the cusp predicted by cdm .    however , there is no consensus whether these results based on gas dynamics represent an actual problem for the cdm paradigm or whether they could be reconciled with it by taking a variety of observational uncertainties ( e.g. , slit positioning , spatial resolution ) , analysis problems ( e.g. , binning and folding of the rotation curves ) , and modelling assumptions ( e.g. , non - circular and off - planar gas motions ) into account ( de blok et al .",
    "2003 ; swaters et al . 2003 ; spekkens et al . 2005 ) .",
    "therefore , we argue that the ongoing debate will benefit from stellar dynamics to constrain the inner mass distribution of dm with the direct measurement of @xmath7 in a sample of dwarf barred galaxies by means of integral - field spectroscopy .",
