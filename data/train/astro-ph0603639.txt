    "on the other hand , a sub - population of massive and luminous intermediate redshift star - forming galaxies , with emission length sizes larger than 2 kpc , appear to be at earlier stages of the assembly of their content of metals , as indicated by their low oxygen abundances .",
    "this suggests that they are probably also at earlier stages of assembling their stellar masses , as both stellar and metal contents of galaxies are thought to be linked .",
    "metal - poor luminous galaxies at intermediate redshift are therefore expected to deviate from the local baryonic tully - fisher relation .",
    "hammer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have presented a body of evidence to show that present - day intermediate stellar mass galaxies , i.e. , with stellar masses of @xmath119@xmath120 , have built up half of their stellar mass since @xmath89 , and emphasize the importance of luminous infrared galaxies , thought to be starbursts resulting from merging at these masses .",
    "the star formation in luminous infrared galaxies accounts for most of the stellar mass growth in these galaxies since @xmath89 .",
    "they argue that recent merging and gas infall explain both star formation history and morphological changes in a hierarchical galaxy formation scheme , where more than 50 per cent of spiral galaxies experienced their last major merger event less than 8  gyr ago .",
    "intermediate redshift luminous infrared galaxies show oxygen abundances two times lower than local bright disk galaxies ( liang et al .",
    "the presence of a population of intermediate redshift massive and luminous galaxies with oxygen abundances lower than those observed locally for similar galaxies , supports the scenario in which the assembly of intermediate stellar mass galaxies is still operating between @xmath89 and @xmath121 .",
    "the sample studied in this paper is by no means complete .",
    "it is not possible therefore to assess the implication of our findings for constraining galaxy assembly from @xmath89 to the present epoch .",
    "additional work to determine the properties of metal - poor massive galaxies and their evolution , e.g. , number density , stellar masses , morphologies , and stellar mass function , is needed to help reveal the nature of star formation during the last @xmath122 gyr . in the near future",
    "it will be possible to conduct further studies to measure chemical properties and stellar masses of star - forming galaxies at intermediate redshifts , in order to tightly constrain the assembly of the stellar and metal content of present day galaxies .",
    "large galaxy surveys like deep2 ( davis et al .",
    "2003 ) and ediscs ( white et al .",
    "2005 ) are promising , as they will observe large samples of galaxies distributed over a wide area and redshift range .",
    "we have used spectrophotometric data for a sample of luminous ( @xmath1 ) , mostly disk , field galaxies in the redshift range @xmath2 , with measured maximum rotation velocities and emission scale lengths , to investigate the properties of the interstellar emitting gas of massive galaxies at intermediate redshift .    emission line equivalent widths and excitation- and metallicity - sensitive emission line diagnostic ratios of the massive star - forming galaxies in our sample cover similar ranges to those observed for local emission line galaxies over a wide range of luminosities , i.e. , @xmath111 .",
    "the properties of the interstellar emitting gas for a subsample of massive and luminous field galaxies at intermediate redshifts are similar to those observed for faint and metal - poor galaxies , with moderate excitation - sensitive diagnostic ratios , at the present cosmic epoch .",
    "the oxygen abundance of interstellar emitting gas has been estimated using the `` strong - line '' method .",
    "these estimated oxygen abundances range from 8.4 to 9.0 in units of .",
    "our sample galaxies exhibit a luminosity  metallicity relation different from that of local galaxies .",
    "a subsample of massive galaxies show oxygen abundances that are consistent with what is observed locally for their local couterparts .",
    "however , a fraction of massive star - forming galaxies in our sample have low oxygen abundances that are observed locally only for much fainter galaxies , in agreement with the findings of other recent investigations of the chemical properties of star - forming galaxies at intermediate redshifts ( kobulnicky et al . 2003 ; liang et al .",
    "2004 , maier et al .",
    "oxygen abundances are not found to correlated with either the maximum rotation velocity nor with the emission scale length size of the galaxy .",
    "luminous and large field galaxies at intermediate redshifts show similar extinction - uncorrected and intrinsic star formation rates to their local couterparts , independent of their gas phase oxygen abundances .",
    "the nebular extinction as derived from the ratio of the extinction - uncorrected star formation rates based on and , respectively , is found to span a similar range to that for star - forming galaxies at the present epoch , but has a lower mean than is observed locally for optically - selected galaxy samples .",
    "intermediate redshift luminous metal - rich galaxies exhibit similar internal reddening and intrinsic star formation rate to local bright metal - rich galaxies , while luminous metal - poor galaxies show lower internal reddening , similar to what is observed locally for faint metal - poor galaxies , but similar intrinsic star formation rate to metal - rich galaxies .",
    "the relationship between gas phase oxygen abundance and colour excess for intermediate redshift galaxies is similar to that observed at the present epoch .",
    "the best interpretation for this is that the dust obscuration is regulated more by galaxy metal content than luminosity .",
    "the diversity of the properties of massive and large galaxies at intermediate redshifts supports the scenario whereby galaxies are still assembling their baryonic content between @xmath89 and @xmath121 .",
    "intermediate redshift massive and large galaxies with low gas phase oxygen abundances are most likely immature galaxies that will increase their metallicities and their stellar masses to the present epoch .",
