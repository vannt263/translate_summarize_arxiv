    "while the discovery of a standard model ( sm)-like higgs boson at 125 gev has been the most significant result obtained at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) to date @xcite , no signal for new physics beyond the sm has yet emerged .",
    "any new colored particle would be the best targets for the lhc due to the large qcd production cross sections .",
    "searches for hadronic final states do , however , suffer from the complicated hadronic environment .",
    "hadronically - quiet new physics searches in leptonic final states are typically challenging due to the smaller electroweak production cross sections , yet the associated sm backgrounds are more clearly understood .",
    "weak scale supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most promising new physics scenarios , and the search for supersymmetric particles continues to be one of the main efforts of lhc studies .",
    "lhc susy searches have largely focused on gluinos and squarks .",
    "the null results have set lower limits of about 1200 gev and 800 gev , respectively , for the masses of gluinos and degenerate first- and second- generation squarks @xcite .",
    "the limits on the electroweak sector of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , however , are much less stringent .",
    "if low energy supersymmetry is realized in the nature , sleptons are likely to be light .",
    "this feature emerges in the gauge mediated susy - breaking scenarios @xcite and the anomaly mediated susy - breaking scenarios @xcite , wherein the slepton masses are proportional to the electroweak gauge couplings . even in the minimal gravity",
    "mediated susy - breaking scenarios ( msugra ) @xcite where all the scalars have a common mass @xmath11 at a high energy input scale , renormalization group running to low energies typically pushes up the squark mass ( due to the contributions of strongly interacting gluinos ) while the sleptons remain relatively light .",
    "the observation of sleptons , even in the presence of the strong lower bounds on squark and gluino masses , would be consistent with these expectations .",
    "thus , it is timely to fully explore the discovery potential of the lhc for the lepton superpartners .    in the @xmath12-parity",
    "conserving mssm , the lightest neutralino @xmath13 can be a natural candidate for weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) dark matter @xcite when it is the lsp .",
    "when sleptons are light , the @xmath14-channel process @xmath15 mediated by the exchange of sleptons can be important in determining the @xmath13 annihilation cross section @xcite , and for fairly degenerate spectra of sleptons and @xmath13 , coannihilation processes can also become important @xcite . therefore , discovery of the sleptons would not only provide a verification of low energy supersymmetry in nature ; precise measurement of their masses could also play an important role in determining the relic density of the neutralino lsp .",
    "light sleptons also contribute to low energy precision observables , such as the electron and proton weak charges that can be measured in parity - violation @xmath16 mller scattering and @xmath17 scattering @xcite , respectively , the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xcite , or tests of first row ckm unitarity @xcite . with the precision achieved ( attainable ) in current ( future ) measurements@xcite , these low energy observables provide an indirect probe of the slepton sector that complements the lhc direct search .    earlier studies of the slepton discovery potential at the lhc focused primarily on the drell - yan pair production of slepton pairs , with each slepton decaying directly to a lepton and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "most of those studies have been performed either in the msugra framework or for a certain set of benchmark points only .",
    "dilepton plus missing @xmath18 final states have also been searched for at the lhc .",
    "when the results are interpreted in terms of slepton drell - yan pair production with direct decays to a bino - like lsp , the current limit is fairly weak : @xmath19 300 gev for left - handed sleptons ( @xmath20 ) with a relatively light lsp @xcite .",
    "sleptons can also be produced in the cascade decay of gauginos when kinematically accessible .",
    "the gaugino pair production cross sections are typically larger than that of the direct slepton drell - yan process , given the fermionic nature of the gauginos .",
    "once sleptons are lighter than gauginos , the gaugino dominantly decays to a slepton and lepton , with the slepton subsequently decaying to another lepton and the lsp . for heavier neutralinos and charginos , such lepton - rich final states",
    "greatly extends the reach of neutralino and charginos at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "in addition , imposing a sharp cut on the invariant mass distribution of two leptons produced in the @xmath21 decay could provide further discrimination of the signal from the sm backgrounds , potentially allowing for discovery of the slepton in gaugino decays @xcite .",
    "the implications of null results in the searches of neutralino / chargino decay via sleptons , however , are limited .",
    "first , such experimental searches apply only to the case when sleptons are lighter than heavier gauginos ; naturally there is no sensitivity to sleptons from gaugino decays once the decay is kinematically forbidden .",
    "second , even when sleptons are lighter than heavier gauginos , the experimental limits apply only to the case of wino - like pair - produced gauginos with a bino - like lsp and are , therefore , only sensitive to the stau or the left - handed slepton ( @xmath20 ) . finally , when the @xmath21 and @xmath22 are higgsino - like states , no reach in the slepton mass can be derived even if the cascade decay is kinematically allowed , since the branching fraction into sleptons is highly suppressed by the small lepton yukawa couplings and the small gaugino fractions of the the neutralino and chargino states .    due to these limitations for the production of sleptons via",
    "neutralino / chargino decays , we are motivated to investigate the reach for sleptons via direct slepton drell - yan pair production , focusing on same flavor , opposite sign dilepton plus @xmath3 signal .",
    "earlier studies of the slepton searches at the lhc @xcite assumed a bino - like lsp .",
    "the sensitivity of this channel , however , depends sensitively on the slepton being either left- or right - handed , as well on the composition of the lsp as being either bino , wino , or higgsino dominated .",
    "utilizing the current search channel of dilepton plus @xmath3 with data collected at the 8 tev lhc , we re - interpret the results that have been presented by the atlas and cms collaborations assuming a bino - like lsp for cases with a wino - like or a higgsino - like lsp .",
    "we also study the exclusion limits and discovery reach for sleptons at the 14 tev lhc for various choices of the lsp .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we conclude .",
    "the lhc slepton sensitivity considered here depends on both the slepton pair production cross sections and the detailed nature of the branching fractions for the slepton decays .",
    "the latter , in turn , is determined by the electroweakino ( chargino / neutralino ) spectrum . for simplicity , we consider the low - lying spectrum of the mssm electroweak sector to include only sleptons , neutralinos and charginos",
    ". we also assume negligible flavor mixing between the slepton generations and zero left - right mixing of the first two generation sleptons ( motivated by their small yukawa couplings ) .",
    "we can then label the charged slepton mass eigenstates for the first two generations as @xmath0 and @xmath23 , for @xmath24 , with masses @xmath4 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "these masses are governed by the soft breaking mass terms @xmath26 and @xmath27 : @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where the d - term contributions are @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the sneutrino masses are controlled by @xmath26 as well and are , therefore , related to @xmath4 with a small splitting introduced by electroweak effects : @xmath32 ; for the range of @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "the phenomenology and implication of sizable flavor mixing in the slepton sector can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the third generation charged leptons ( staus ) ,",
    "left - right mixing may be sizable , especially if @xmath35 is large .",
    "we focus here on the first two generations of sleptons , although our approach could be adapted to the stau case as well by taking the tau tagging efficiency and stau left - right mixing into account .",
    "the decay of sleptons depends on the composition and spectrum of neutralinos and charginos , which is set mainly by the bino , wino , and higgsino mass parameters @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "we consider three representative cases :    * bino - like lsp : @xmath39 , yielding a neutralino lsp @xmath13 that is bino - like .",

    ".    in the wino - like lsp and higgsino - like lsp cases , @xmath22 ( and @xmath21 in the higgsino - like lsp case ) decays to the neutralino lsp with very soft jets and leptons .",
    "identifying these decays is very difficult at the lhc . for these cases , then , the nearly degenerate neutralino and chargino states all appear as @xmath3 at the lhc .    in our discussion",
    "below , we assume the slepton decays directly to the @xmath13 lsp ( and neutralino / chargino states that are degenerate with the lsp for the wino- or higgsino - like lsp cases ) plus one lepton , a mode that is most likely to occur when the slepton is lighter than all other heavier neutralinos and charginos . in cases when sleptons are heavier than charginos and neutralinos other than the lsp ( and its nearly degenerate neutralino / chargino states ) , sleptons may decay into those neutralino / chargino states , which subsequently cascade decay to the lsp .",
    "the final states from such processes are typically more complicated , involving multi - leptons , multi - jets and @xmath3 . while a slepton search relying on such slepton cascade decays is complementary to the one assuming direct decay of the slepton to the lsp plus a lepton , an analysis of the cascade decay scenario goes beyond the scope of our current study , and we leave it for future work .",
    "we now turn to the slepton branching fractions for the three different lsp cases . for the bino - like lsp , @xmath42 and @xmath23 both decay to @xmath43 , and @xmath44 decays to @xmath45 with 100% branching fraction . for the wino - like lsp",
