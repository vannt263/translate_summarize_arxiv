    "however , the transition density ( if it exists ) of a general lvy process rarely admits an explicit expression . thus obtaining sharp estimates on @xmath8",

    ", two - sided estimates for the transition densities of discontinuous lvy processes killed upon leaving an open set @xmath0 ( equivalently , the dirichlet heat kernels ) have been established very recently for a few particular processes only .",
    "the first of such estimates is obtained in @xcite , where we succeeded in establishing sharp two - sided estimates for the heat kernel of the fractional laplacian @xmath9 with zero exterior condition on @xmath10 ( or equivalently , the transition density of the killed symmetric @xmath11-stable process ) in any @xmath2 open set @xmath0 .",
    "the approach developed in @xcite provides a road map for establishing sharp two - sided heat kernel estimates of other jump processes in open subsets of @xmath7 .",

    "the characteristic exponents of these lvy processes admit explicit expressions , the boundary decay rates of the dirichlet heat kernels are suitable powers of the distance to the boundary . on the other hand , a varopoulos type two - sided dirichlet heat kernel estimate of symmetric stable processes in @xmath1-fat open sets was derived in @xcite ; this type of estimates is expressed in terms of surviving probabilities and the global transition density of the symmetric stable process .",
    "the objective of this paper is to establish sharp two - sided estimates on the transition density @xmath12 for a large class of purely discontinuous rotationally symmetric lvy processes . unlike the cases considered in @xcite , the characteristic exponents of the symmetric lvy processes considered in this paper are quite general , satisfying only certain mild growth condition at @xmath13 .",
