    "in the three flavor framework of neutrino oscillations , the only two parameters whose lower bound is not known in the mixing matrix @xmath4 . ]",
    "are @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and the magnitude of @xmath7 is expected to give us a clue to model buildings .",
    "tanimoto @xcite gave various examples of models which predict the magnitude of @xmath8 .",
    "some ( e.g. , anarchy models ) predict large @xmath9 where @xmath10 , other models ( those with some flavor symmetry or with the conformal field fixed point ) predict @xmath11 or @xmath12 , while zee type models typically give tiny @xmath13 .",
    "some gut models predict testable sum rules among @xmath14 and @xmath4 .",
    "koide @xcite emphasized that the deviation of the solar mixing angle from the maximal mixing is small in the zee model : @xmath15 this relation can be checked experimentally in the near future .",
    "kitabayashi @xcite presented a model with a minimal @xmath16 gauge symmetry , an approximate @xmath17 symmetry and a discrete @xmath18 symmetry .",
    "this model yields the lma msw solution and explains the hierarchy @xmath19 by loop corrections .",
    "leung @xcite considered effective operators relevant for generating small majorana neutrino masses .",
    "all the effective higher dimensional ( @xmath20 ) operators are compiled which conserve baryon number and the sm gauge invariance but violate lepton number by two units . if neutrinoless double @xmath21 decays are observed , then a number of operators will be reduced .",
    "geer @xcite discussed how precise measurements of the oscillation parameters would give us useful information at high energy scale , by taking a specific susy so(10 ) gut model with the lma msw solution . in this particular example",
    ", superbeam experiments and/or neutrino factories will constrain the possible values of the gut - scale parameters .",
    "lisi @xcite reported on analysis of the atmospheric neutrino data in two , three and four flavor frameworks . in the two flavor framework",
    "it was shown that @xmath23 oscillation with maximal mixing is robust .",
    "also in the three flavor scenario , by combining with the chooz data the dominant oscillation in the atmospheric neutrino was shown to be @xmath23 , possibly with small contribution of @xmath24 .",
    "it was pointed out that non - hierarchical scenario where @xmath25 holds are not totally excluded yet . in the four flavor case the data were analyzed with the so - called ( 2 + 2)-scheme , and some contribution of @xmath26 is still allowed at present .",
    "pea - garay @xcite presented analysis of the solar neutrino data in two , three and four flavor mixings . in the case of two flavor",
    "active oscillations , the lma msw solution is the best fit , and it is followed by the low solution .",
    "the sma msw and vacuum solutions seem to be disfavored now . in the two flavor sterile oscillations ,",
    "the sma msw solution is the best fit . in the three flavor scenario , with the chooz constraint ,",
    "the dominant channel is @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath28 and @xmath29 oscillations occur with equal weight . in the four neutrino mixing with the ( 2 + 2)-scheme ,",
    "the oscillation probability is characterized by one additional parameter @xmath30 which becomes 0 ( 1 ) for pure active ( sterile ) oscillation , respectively . by combining the analyses of the solar and atmospheric neutrino data ,",
    "it was found before the sno data that the case with pure @xmath31 in the solar neutrinos and pure @xmath32 in the atmospheric neutrinos is close to the best fit . even after the sno data this solution is not excluded",
    "yet @xcite .",
    "petcov @xcite gave a talk on the neutrino mass spectrum and cp violation in the lepton sector in the three flavor framework .",
    "neutrinoless double @xmath21 decay experiments in the future can provide information on the lightest neutrino mass and the cp violation in the lepton sector .",
    "in particular , if a positive result ( @xmath33ev ) is reported from neutrinoless double @xmath21 decay experiments , then combining the data of @xmath34h @xmath21 decay experiments of the katrin project , it would allow us to determine @xmath35 and to know the existence of the cp violation in the lepton sector .",
    "in the past there have been a lot of discussions on the physics potential of neutrino factories and conventional superbeams , and people investigated the optimum baseline and the muon ( or neutrino ) energy to determine @xmath5 , the sign of @xmath36 and the cp phase @xmath6 of the mnsp matrix in the three flavor framework .",
    "recent progress includes the effects of correlations of errors of the oscillation parameters , the background effects , etc .",
    "the ultimate purpose of neutrino factories and conventional superbeams is to determine @xmath6 .",
    "so far all the discussions are based on indirect measurements of cp violation , i.e. , assuming the three flavor mixing , a quantity @xmath37 ^ 2 \\over \\sigma^2_j } , \\label{eqn : indirect}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which compares the difference of the cases of @xmath38 and @xmath39 with the errors , is optimized . in ( [ eqn : indirect ] ) @xmath40 stands for a binned number of events with @xmath6 and it is understood that @xmath41 is optimized with respect to other parameters in @xmath42 .",
    "as has been criticized by some people @xcite , this approach does not directly deal with cp violating processes , since @xmath43 and @xmath44 are not directly compared and what we wish to have is an analogue of @xmath45 in the @xmath46 system @xcite .",
    "however , such quantity has not been discovered yet in the case of neutrino factories or any very long baseline experiments , since the dependence of the probabilities for @xmath43 and @xmath44 on @xmath6 and @xmath47 is such that @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a certain function and @xmath51 stands for the matter effect , and the quantity obtained from experiments on @xmath44 is @xmath52 , so that comparison between @xmath53 and @xmath54 is impossible in a strict sense .",
    "therefore all the discussions below basically use indirect measurements of cp violation .",
    "one of the important issues in the discussions on uncertainties of the parameters is that of the density of the earth .",
    "geller , a geophysicist working on the three dimensional structure of the earth , explained the density distribution in the earth s interior to physicists @xcite . to determine the density ,",
    "there are complications .",
    "the neutrino path goes through the upper mantle as well as the crust , so one needs both crust models and regional upper mantle models which are not well established with great accuracy at present .",
    "the distribution of the density is much less well constrained than seismic velocities which are known relatively well . despite all these problems , from ballpark guesses rather than rigorous error estimation procedures",
    ", he concluded that the accuracy of estimates of the average density along the neutrino beam is at worst @xmath210% and is probably within @xmath25% .",
    "there were two talks in which a method was presented to treat the density profile which is in general not constant .",
    "takasugi @xcite discussed t violation and derived a formula up to third order in @xmath55 and @xmath56 where @xmath57 stands for deviation from the prem .",
    "he concluded that the asymmetric matter contribution to t violation is negligible .",
    "ota @xcite presented a method of fourier expansion of the density profile to discuss the matter effect and its ambiguity , and showed that only the first few coefficients are important .",
    "lindner @xcite discussed the optimization of sensitivity to @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath6 , taking into account the correlations of errors of the oscillations parameters and assuming that background effects are negligible . in the case of @xmath58 ,",
    "the optimum baseline lies between 1000 km and 5000 km . in the case of @xmath59 ,",
    "1000km@xmath615000 km gives similar results for @xmath62 and the optimum baseline is between 7000 km and 8000 km for @xmath63 .",
    "sensitivity to @xmath60 turns out to be much worse than that of the kamland experiment @xcite . as for @xmath6 ,",
    "the optimum baseline is around 3000 km and high energy ( @xmath6440gev ) is preferred .",
    "this result almost agrees with @xcite and @xcite . , @xmath65 )",
    ", the conditions on the backgrounds or on the uncertainty of the matter effect and the statistical treatments are different among these works .",
    "it should be clarified in the future work which condition is important to obtain the different optimum set ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) .",
    "i would like to thank p. huber for communications on this point . ]    burguet - castell and mena @xcite refined their analysis in @xcite of the sensitivity to @xmath6 and @xmath5 by considering the full range of these parameters .",
    "they found that there is twofold degeneracy in ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) .",
    "this is because the expansion of the oscillation probabilities to second order in @xmath66 gives a quadratic equation in @xmath5 : @xmath67 where notations are given in @xcite . to resolve this degeneracy",
    ", a combination of two baselines seems necessary .",
    "pinney @xcite also discussed the optimum baseline and the muon energy of a neutrino factory for @xmath6 , by taking into account the systematic errors and the correlations of errors of the oscillation parameters as well as the density of the earth . if the background fraction @xmath68 is @xmath3 and the uncertainty of the matter effect is @xmath25% , then @xmath6950gev and @xmath703000 km is the optimum parameter set ( this result almost agrees with those in @xcite and @xcite ) , but if @xmath71 or if the uncertainty of the matter effect is @xmath210% , then the lower muon energy ( @xmath7220gev ) and the shorter baseline ( @xmath701000km3000 km ) gives the optimum .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that @xmath41 used in the analysis in @xcite has behavior @xmath73 for large @xmath1 ( @xmath74 stands for the jarlskog parameter ) , so that sensitivity to cp violation is lost in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "( [ eqn : largeemu ] ) also suggests that neutrino factories with @xmath6950gev and @xmath703000 km are mainly sensitive to @xmath75 instead of @xmath76 .",
    "( @xmath77 in the notation of @xcite ) by saying that @xmath78 has the behavior @xmath79 in the large @xmath1 limit and has sensitivity mainly to @xmath76 .",
    "however , this argument does not include the effects due to the correlations of errors , and once optimization with respect to other parameters is done , the correct behavior ( [ eqn : largeemu ] ) is obtained . ]",
    "koike @xcite presented their discussions in @xcite on the optimum baseline and the muon energy at neutrino factories .",
    "his main strategy is to use @xmath80 ^ 2 \\over \\sigma^2_j } , \\label{eqn : chi2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 stands for a suitably normalized binned number of events for @xmath82 oscillations and again optimization with respect to other parameters in @xmath42 and @xmath83 is understood .",
    "he claimed that @xmath84 ( @xmath85 in the notation of @xcite ) is sensitive to @xmath75 whereas @xmath41 in ( [ eqn : indirect ] ) is mainly to @xmath76 . in my opinion , however , @xmath41 in ( [ eqn : indirect ] ) and @xmath86 in ( [ eqn : chi2 ] ) are basically the same , as their large @xmath1 behaviors are the same after the correlations of errors are taken into account and both use indirect measurements of cp violation .",
    "in fact , the conclusion by koike that @xmath6910gev and @xmath701000 km optimizes the sensitivity to @xmath6 almost agrees with that in @xcite where the case of @xmath87 the uncertainty of the matter effect=@xmath210% and @xmath88 was also considered ( see fig . 8 in @xcite ) . notice that koike assumed that all the uncertainty of the oscillation parameters as well as the matter effect is @xmath210% .",
    "wang @xcite also discussed the optimum baseline for experiments with conventional superbeams and for neutrino factories by introducing a figure of merit which is defined as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the oscillation probability , @xmath91 is the number of events , @xmath68 is the background fraction , @xmath92 is the systematic uncertainty , and @xmath93 is the uncertainty of the flux and the cross sections .",
    "he concluded that @xmath942000km3000 km is preferred for measurements of @xmath59 , @xmath6 and the sign of @xmath36 .",
    "minakata @xcite discussed the physics potential of the phase ii jhf experiment which is expected to have 4mw power and 1mt water cherenkov detectors .",
    "he examined if it is possible to determine the @xmath59 , the sign of @xmath36 and @xmath6 by introducing a cp trajectory diagram , in which a point sweeps out an ellipse in the @xmath95 ",
    "@xmath96 plane as @xmath6 ranges from 0 to @xmath97 .",
    "the behavior of the ellipse varies depending on the sign of @xmath36 , and in certain cases it is possible to determine @xmath6 and @xmath36 in the phase ii jhf experiment . on the other hand ,",
    "if the oscillation parameters lie in unlucky regions , then there is a twofold ambiguity in ( @xmath6 , @xmath36 ) .",
    "this ambiguity is resolved by putting another detector at @xmath0=700 km .",
    "okamura @xcite discussed the physics potential of a very long baseline experiment ( @xmath0=2100 km ) with conventional superbeams ( 3gev@xmath986gev ) .",
    "taking into account the correlations of errors and the background effects , he examined sensitivity to the sign of @xmath36 , @xmath59 , ( @xmath99 , @xmath100 ) , and @xmath6 .",
    "with such a long baseline , sensitivity to the sign of @xmath36 is very good , but sensitivity to ( @xmath99 , @xmath100 ) is poor as is naively expected .",
    "sensitivity to @xmath6 is good for @xmath101 , assuming the detector size 100kt@xmath102yr .",
    "to account for the solar and atmospheric neutrino data as well as the lsnd result in terms of neutrino oscillations , one has to have at least four neutrino mass eigenstates since one would need at least three independent mass squared differences .",
    "four neutrino scenarios are classified into two categories , the ( 2 + 2)-scheme and the ( 3 + 1)-scheme , depending on the number of degenerate mass eigenstates separated by @xmath103 .    peres @xcite reviewed the phenomenology of the ( 3 + 1)-scheme , which is excluded by the lsnd data at 95%cl but allowed at 99%cl .",
    "the upper left @xmath104 components of the mnsp matrix for the ( 3 + 1)-scheme are supposed to be close to those for the three flavor case , so it gives a good fit to the data of the solar and atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "the ( 3 + 1)-scheme is allowed only for @xmath1050.9 , 1.7 , 6.0 ev@xmath106 , so the upper limit on the absolute neutrino masses would constrain the allowed region of this scheme .",
    "@xmath21 decay experiments , neutrinoless double @xmath21 decay experiments and supernova neutrinos give some bounds .",
    "bell @xcite discussed how relic neutrino asymmetries may be generated in the early universe via active - sterile oscillations .",
    "in the two flavor framework it is known that asymmetry between @xmath43 and @xmath44 is generated through active - sterile oscillations under a certain condition for neutrino masses and the mixing parameters .",
    "the implications of this mechanism to big bang nucleosynthesis was given in the case of a particular ( 2 + 2)-scheme model where a @xmath107 pair is separated by a @xmath108 pair , and the conclusion was that @xmath109 for positive ( negative ) asymmetry , respectively .",
    "donini @xcite compared the physics reach of a neutrino factory in the ( 3 + 1)- and ( 2 + 2)-schemes . in both schemes huge cp violating effects",
    "can be observed with a 1kt detector , @xmath110 s and @xmath111 km in the @xmath112 channel . in case a conclusive confirmation of the lsnd result",
    "is absent , it is difficult to discriminate the ( 3 + 1)-scheme from the three flavor case unless the mixing angle is large and it is easy to discriminate the ( 2 + 2)-scheme from the three flavor case .",
