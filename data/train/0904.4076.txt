    "neutron stars , collapsed objects half again more massive than the sun , are thought to have solid crusts about a kilometer thick .",
    "detailed properties of this crust are important for many x - ray , radio , and gravitational wave observations . because of the great densities , the electronic structure of the crust is likely very simple , consisting of an extremely degenerate relativistic fermi gas .",
    "the system can be modeled as nearly classical ions interacting via screened coulomb , or yukawa , interactions , where the screening length @xmath1 depends on the electron density .    indeed many condensed matter systems can be modeled with yukawa interactions and much is known about the properties of a single component yukawa system .",
    "see for example ref . @xcite .",
    "because the ion - ion interaction is purely repulsive , there is no liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "however there is a liquid solid phase transition at a melting temperature @xmath2 that depends primarily on the coulomb parameter @xmath3 , @xmath4 here the ions have charge @xmath0 , @xmath5 is the temperature and the ion sphere radius @xmath6 is @xmath7^{1/3 } \\label{a}\\ ] ] with @xmath8 the ion density.the system melts at a temperature for which @xmath9 ( assuming the screening length is relatively large ) .",
    "neutron stars , that accrete material from a binary companion , form new crust from the ashes of nuclear reactions . simulations of rapid proton capture nucleosynthesis @xcite@xcite find a complex composition with many different ion species .",
    "these species then undergo electron capture as the material is buried by further accretion to greater densities @xcite .",
    "this still leaves a complex composition of very neutron rich isotopes with many different chemical elements . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the structure of the resulting solid crust when this complex mixture freezes .",
    "monte carlo simulations @xcite of the freezing of a classical one component plasma ( ocp ) indicate that it can freeze into imperfect body centered cubic ( bcc ) or face - centered cubic ( fcc ) microcrystals .",
    "unfortunetly not much has been published on the freezing of a multi - component plasma ( mcp ) , although wunsch et al .",
    "study the structure of a mcp liquid @xcite .",
    "there are many possibilities for the state of a cold mcp @xcite .",
    "it can be a regular mcp lattice ; or microcrystals ; or an amorphous , uniformly mixed structure ; or a lattice of one phase with random admixture of other ions ; or even an ensemble of phase separated domains .",
    "one possibility is that impurities could become frozen into random configurations that only relax on very long time scales .",
    "this could lead to the formation of a glass .",
    "for example , the binary lennard - jones system , with two species of different sizes , can form a glass @xcite . here",
    "the hard core of the interaction keeps the different species from diffusing .",
    "however the screened coulomb interaction has a relatively soft @xmath10 core .",
    "this may allow impurities to diffuse and prevent the formation of a glass .",
    "in this paper we use molecular dynamics simulations to calculate radial distribution functions @xmath11 and static structure factors @xmath12 to determine the structure of the crust . in previous work",
    "we determined the chemical separation that takes place as the crust freezes .",
    "we found that the liquid phase is greatly enriched in low charge @xmath0 ions while the solid is enriched in high @xmath0 ions @xcite .",
    "the distribution of low @xmath0 ( impurity ) ions in the crust may be important for the rate of strongly screened thermonuclear or pycnonuclear ( density driven ) reactions . in ref .",
    "@xcite we found that fusion of @xmath13o + @xmath13o could be an important heat source in the crust .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we calculated the thermal conductivity of the crust .",
    "we found the crust to be a regular crystal with a relatively high thermal conductivity .",
    "recently the cooling of two neutron stars has been observed after extended outbursts @xcite .",
    "these outbursts heat the stars crusts out of equilibrium and then the cooling time is measured as the crusts return to equilibrium .",
    "the surface temperature of the neutron star in ks 1731 - 260 decreased with an exponential time scale of 325 @xmath14 100 days while mxb 1659 - 29 has a time scale of 505 @xmath14 59 days @xcite . comparing these observations , of rapid cooling , to calculations by rutledge",

    "@xcite strongly suggest that the crust has a high thermal conductivity .",
    "the shear modulus of a single component system was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite where electron screening was found to reduce the shear modulus by about 10% compared to a pure @xmath10 coulomb system @xcite .",
    "the shear modulus determines the frequency of shear oscillations of the neutron star crust .",
    "these may have been observed as quasiperiodic oscillations in magnetar giant flares @xcite . in the future",
    ", we will use the results of this paper to calculate the effects of impurities on the shear modulus .",
    "the breaking strain is the deformation of the crust when it fails .",
    "this determines the maximum height of mountains on the surface of neutron stars .",
    "these may be important sources of gravitational waves for rapidly rotating stars @xcite",
    ". the breaking strain may also be important for star quake models of magnetar giant flares @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we examine the effects of impurities on the breaking strain .",
    "the present paper is similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , however here we use a significantly different composition .",
    "@xcite had so many low @xmath0 impurities that phase separation was apparently taking place",
    ". therefore , ref .",
    "@xcite results may not be directly applicable to large uniform systems . in the present paper",
    "we consider a system with fewer impurities , as described in section [ md ] , that may form a uniform system .",
    "impurities can limit the thermal conductivity .",
    "if the impurities are weakly correlated then their effect on the thermal conductivity can be described by an impurity parameter @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath16 this depends on the dispersion in the charge @xmath0 of each ion .",
    "the rp process ash composition of ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite has a relatively large value of @xmath17 . in this paper ,",
    "the composition we use has a smaller , but still significant , value @xmath18 .",
    "this lower value is because of a reduction in low @xmath0 impurities .",
    "impurity scattering can be important at low temperatures where there is less scattering from thermal fluctuations .",
    "note that ref .",
    "@xcite assumes the impurities are weakly correlated .",
    "if there are important correlations among the impurities , for example if there is a tendency for low @xmath0 ions to cluster together instead of being distributed at random through out the lattice , then the effects of impurities on the thermal conductivity could be different from what is calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we perform md simulations to study the distribution of impurities and their effect on the conductivity .    in section [ md ]",
    "we describe our molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "results for the radial distribution function @xmath11 , the static structure factor @xmath12 , and the thermal conductivity are presented in section [ results ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we describe our classical molecular dynamics simulations . we begin with a discussion of the composition .",
    "schatz et al . have calculated the rapid proton capture ( rp ) process of hydrogen burning on the surface of an accreting neutron star @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "this produces a variety of nuclei up to mass @xmath19 .",
    "gupta et al .",
    "then calculate how the composition of this rp process ash evolves , because of electron capture and light particle reactions , as the material is buried by further accretion .",
    "their final composition , at a density of @xmath20 g/@xmath21 , has forty % of the ions with atomic number @xmath22 , while an additional 10% have @xmath23 .",
    "the remaining 50% have a range of lower @xmath0 from 8 to 32 .",
    "in particular about 3% is @xmath13o and 1% @xmath24ne .",
    "this gupta et al .",
    "composition is listed in the mixture column of table i in ref .",
    "@xcite and was used for the simulations in ref .",
    "@xcite . in general , nuclei at this depth in the crust are expected to be neutron rich because of electron capture .",
    "material accretes into a liquid ocean . as the density increases near the bottom of the ocean , the material freezes",
    ". however we found chemical separation when the complex rp ash mixture freezes @xcite .",
    "the ocean is greatly enriched in low @xmath0 elements compared to the newly formed solid .",
    "what does chemical separation mean for the structure of the crust ?",
    "here we make a very simple assumption and use the composition of the solid phase that was found in ref . @xcite .",
    "[ note that for simplicity we drop chemical elements with number fraction less than 0.001 .",
    "] this composition is listed in table [ tableone ] and is depleted in low @xmath0 elements compared to the original gupta et al . composition .",
    "for example , we now have only about 1% @xmath13o compared to the original 3% .",
    "our composition may not be self consistent because we expect chemical separation to enrich the ocean in low @xmath0 elements and this may change the composition of the newly formed crust .",
    "this should be investigated in future work .",
    ".composition of rapid proton capture nucleosynthesis ash md simulations : number fraction @xmath25 of chemical element with atomic number @xmath0 and mass number @xmath26 . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tabletwo ]",
    "using molecular dynamics simulations we have calculated the structure of a 27648 ion crystal made from a complex composition of rapid proton capture nucleosynthesis ash that includes many impurities .",
    "even with many impurities characterized by a large impurity parameter @xmath18 , we find a regular body centered cubic crystal with long range order .",
    "we do not find an amorphous structure .",
    "we find that low @xmath0 impurities often occupy interstitial sites while high @xmath0 impurities tend to occupy substitutional sites .",
    "there are strong attractive short range correlations between low @xmath0 impurities that grow with decreasing temperature .",
    "these correlations could significantly enhance the rate of pycnonuclear ( density driven ) reactions at high densities .",
    "the static structure factor @xmath12 is enhanced by impurity scattering over @xmath12 for a one component plasma .",
    "furthermore there are important correlations between impurities that may invalidate simple models that assume the impurities are randomly distributed .",
    "the thermal conductivity is reduced by impurity scattering to such an extent that if the inner crust is as impure as the present simulations for the outer crust show , then the electron thermal conductivity in the inner crust will be reduced to such an extent that it may disagree with interpretations @xcite of observations @xcite of rapid crust cooling .",
    "if the interpretation of these observations is correct , we conclude that either ( a ) the large impurity concentrations in our initial rp ash composition are wrong or ( b ) impurity concentrations are reduced by the time material is buried deeper into the inner crust",
    ". this could be because of nuclear reactions .",
    "finally these results will be used in additional work to calculate the impact of impurities on the mechanical properties of the crust including the shear modulus and the breaking strain .",
    "the shear modulus is important for crust oscillations and the breaking strain may be important for crust breaking models of magnetar giant flares and for the stability of mountains that may radiate gravitational waves from rapidly rotating neutron stars .",
