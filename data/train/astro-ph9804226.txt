    "discovering the properties of galaxies at redshifts greater than one requires techniques that can readily distinguish the high redshift objects from those at lower redshift that predominate in any deep image .",
    "multi - wavelength approaches are especially fruitful and have been dominated to date by optical and radio surveys .",
    "the use of photometric redshifts based on the strong lyman break redshifted into the optical band has been one of the most successful of these techniques ( steidel et al .",
    "1996 , and references therein ) .",
    "methods using infrared images are beginning to uncover objects not easily discovered with optical or radio methods that may , nevertheless , constitute a significant fraction of the high redshift population .",
    "these include objects distinguished by unusually red colors ( elston , rieke , & rieke 1988 ; soifer et al .",
    "1994 ; graham et al . 1994 ; hu & ridgway 1994 ; cowie et al . 1994 ; dey , spinrad , & dickinson 1995 ) and objects with emission lines redshifted to infrared wavelengths ( songaila et al . 1994 ; thompson , mannucci , & beckwith 1996 , hereafter tmb96 ; malkan , teplitz , & mclean 1995 ; bechtold et al .",
    "these objects have been interpreted as elliptical galaxies ( graham et al .",
    "1994 ; hu & ridgway 1994 ; dunlop et al .",
    "1996 ) , young `` protogalaxies '' undergoing bursts of star formation ( eisenhardt & dickinson 1992 ; graham & dey 1996 ; malkan , teplitz , & mclean 1996 ; yee et al . 1996 ; bechtold et al .",
    "1997 ) , or active galactic nuclei ( cowie et al . 1994 ; dey , spinrad , & dickinson 1995 ) .",
    "all of these populations could be significant for cosmology , since the first case implies massive galaxy formation at redshifts greater than @xmath93 , the second indicates a substantial population of young galaxies that can be discovered only in infrared surveys , and the third implies a population of infrared bright active galactic nuclei ( agn ) comparable in number density to the populations of agn discovered by more traditional methods .",
    "only a few such objects have been studied in enough detail to reveal redshifts , source morphologies , and colors .",
    "in the course of our survey for emission line galaxies ( tmb96 ) , an object was discovered near the quasar b2 0149@xmath033 that had an emission line at 2.25@xmath1 m , the same wavelength as the quasar s h@xmath2 line at a redshift of 2.43 ; we call this object tmb 0149 - ck39 , or simply ck39 . a spectrum between 1.5 and 2.4 @xmath1 m , presented and discussed here , confirmed the presence of an emission line nearly coincident in wavelength with that of the quasar .",
    "the object is very red , making it unusual among known , distant galaxies .",
    "this paper describes the results of these observations and suggests that such objects may be common but previously unobservable owing to the lack of optical emission .",
    "the object was discovered in the course of a survey that covered 250 square minutes of arc at wavelengths where the h@xmath2 line would appear at redshifts between about 2.1 and 2.7 ( tmb96 ) . ]",
    "the total co - moving volume was 3@xmath10 mpc@xmath11 ( @xmath12 @xmath13 h@xmath14 / 50 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 , q@xmath14 @xmath13 0.5 are assumed throughout this paper ) . within this volume",
    ", there was only one candidate discovered by comparing images in broad and narrow band filters , searching for emission line objects that were brighter in the narrow band image and more than 3@xmath15 above the background .",
    "simultaneous spectra in the h and k bands of the candidate and the quasar , b2 0149@xmath033 , were taken with the grating spectrometer , cgs4 , at the ukirt telescope on the nights of ut 1996 january 12 to 14 .",
    "the weather was not photometric , with variable seeing at @xmath925 , measured from the quasar continuum .",
    "the objects were dithered along the slit by 10  to 20  and the spectra at these two positions subtracted to eliminate sky emission .",
    "the 2-pixel wide slit ( 24)produced a spectral resolution of 195@xmath16(@xmath1 m ) or 438 at the position of the quasar s h@xmath2 emission line .",
    "the spectra of the quasar and ck39 were extracted using variance weighting in the iraf apextract package , summing across a 2-pixel wide window along the slit .",
    "the poor and variable seeing , combined with uncertainties in the positioning of the slit , preclude an accurate measurement of the line flux from this spectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the resulting spectra , centered on the h@xmath2 line of the quasar .",
    "the quasar spectrum shows a strong h@xmath2 line redshifted to 2.25@xmath1 m , while a faint emission line at the same wavelength is apparent at the positions of ck39 .",
    "the bottom part of the figure shows the extracted spectrum of the line in ck39 at full resolution , overlaid with a scaled plot of the quasar s h@xmath2 line .",
    "the formal signal - to - noise ratio of the emission line is 6.3 , inadequate to conclude more than that an emission line is present , and it is impossible to separate the line into individual components , from h@xmath2 and [ nii ] , for example .",
    "although the emission line in ck39 appears somewhat broad , with a formal line width of 2200kms@xmath7 ( fwhm ) , it may be unresolved within the considerable uncertainties .",
    "the line could thus arise from a galactic object with essentially zero width or an active nucleus with broad lines .    figure  [ fig2 ] shows images taken on the nights of ut 1997",
    "september 9 ( k band ) and ut 1997 october 3 ( r band ) with the 10 m w. m. keck telescopes , obtained in order to determine the morphology of ck39 more accurately .",
    "the k band image shows that ck39 is a pair of extended sources 13 apart , ck39e & ck39w .",
    "the western component , ck39w , has k @xmath13 20.27 @xmath17 0.06 in a 05 radius aperture ; the eastern component is lower surface brightness with k @xmath13 20.57 @xmath17 0.07 in the same aperture .",
    "each component is more extended than the 06 seeing profile : ck39w is 075 and ck39e is 09 ( fwhm ) , uncorrected for the seeing .",
    "the continuum - corrected line emission did appear to be extended in the original survey images , although it is difficult to make an unambiguous determination of the extent in the coarsely sampled survey data .",
    "we were , however , unable to reproduce the distribution of light in ck39 using one or two point sources scaled down from a much brighter star in the same image .",
    "the extended morphology suggests that the object is a pair of galaxies perhaps caught in the process of merging .",
    "the candidate , ck39 , is barely detected in the r band image ( 06 seeing ) as a low surface - brightness diffuse object .",
    "it is clearly extended along an east - west line , but the two components can not be readily distinguished in the image for the purposes of photometry .",
    "the center of light is close to ck39w , however , indicating that the western component is brighter and bluer than ck39e .",
    "table  [ table1 ] lists the parameters of the various observations along with the results , including those from tmb96 , where relevant .",
    "the magnitudes of the individual components were derived using 1  apertures , and they do not include extended light that contributes to the total magnitude .",
    "the line fluxes were derived from a comparison of the original narrow and broad band images with 08 pixel resolution .",
    "the systematic uncertainties of deriving photometric magnitudes between the narrow and broad band filters combined with the problem that the center of the narrow band filter is at one edge of the broad band filter requiring uncertain color corrections means that the tabulated line flux may be 50% brighter or fainter ( 1@xmath15 ) than the listed value .",
    "the coincidence of line emission between the quasar and ck39 and the @xmath9  2@xmath5 size of ck39 suggests that the line is h@xmath2+[nii ] and ck39 is at a redshift of 2.43 .",
    "if the object were in the galaxy or at very low redshift , the only plausible identification would be the v=2@xmath181 s(1 ) line of h@xmath19 at 2.248@xmath1 m , a weak line always accompanied by a series of other lines ( e.g. shull & beckwith 1982 ) that are not seen in our spectrum .",
    "the other strong lines from an extragalactic object that are likely to appear at these wavelengths are br@xmath20 ( @xmath21@xmath1 m ) , p@xmath2 ( @xmath22@xmath1 m ) , and [ fe ii ] ( @xmath23@xmath1 m ) .",
    "if the line were br@xmath20 at @xmath24 , the p@xmath2 line would be seen at 1.948@xmath1 m , within the range of our spectrum and strong enough to show up even through the poor telluric transmission .",
    "the shock - excited line [ fe ii ] ( at @xmath25 ) can be strong in merging systems ( elston & maloney 1990 ; lester , harvey , & carr 1988 ) , as suggested by the morphology of ck39 in the k band , though pa@xmath26 would be visible in our spectrum at 1.755@xmath1 m .",
    "p@xmath2 is thus the only reasonable alternative to h@xmath2+[nii ] to explain the spectrum of ck39 . for the p@xmath2 interpretation , however , one would also have to consider that the ck39 system would then be very low luminosity , several magnitudes fainter than an l@xmath27 galaxy .",
    "table  [ table2 ] gives some of the properties of the object assuming the line is either p@xmath2 or h@xmath2 .",
    "the star formation rates have been estimated using kennicutt s ( 1983 ) empirical relationship between h@xmath2 line luminosity and star formation rate ( sfr ) , assuming zero extinction , no contribution from an active nucleus .",
    "we ignore the possible contribution of [ nii ] to the h@xmath2 line flux following the arguments of bechtold et al .",
    "( 1997 ) which also apply to ck39 for the purposes of this calculation .",
    "table  [ table2 ] includes estimates of the visual extinction , a@xmath28 , local to ck39 needed to produce the observed r@xmath18k@xmath29 5.5 from various template galaxy spectra ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ; coleman , wu , & weedman 1980 ) .",
    "galactic extinction at the lattitude of ck39 , -273 , is estimated to be 03 at r and 01 at k ( or k@xmath30 ) , which is negligible considering other uncertainties .",
    "an extinction of a@xmath28 @xmath31 ( mid - range for different galaxy models ) is required to redden a young star burst galaxy to produce the observed color at a redshift of 2.4 , while an extinction a@xmath32 would be required to produce the observed colors if ck39 is at the lower redshift .",
    "table  [ table2 ] also lists the minimum and maximum volume densities of objects within the @xmath172@xmath15 probability band at the different redshifts , computed by setting the poisson probability to 0.046 ( 2@xmath15 ) .",
    "if the line is h@xmath2+[nii ] , the probability might be substantially enhanced if objects exhibit even mild clustering with quasars .",
    "the maximum separation between ck39 and quasar is 9mpc , adopting the 1@xmath15 maximum redshift difference of 0.01 allowed by the spectra ( @xmath33 m for @xmath34 m ) ; the minimum projected separation is 390kpc . in this case",
    ", the average density of such objects might be lower by a factor of ten or more than @xmath35 without affecting the probability estimates .",
    "our survey covered a much larger volume near redshift 2.4 than at redshifts below 1 , and the global star formation rate appears to be larger at @xmath362.4 than at @xmath360.2 ( madau et al .",
    "the chance of discovering any kind of exotic object should thus be greater at higher redshifts .",
    "we therefore believe that this line is h@xmath2+[nii ] .",
    "the object ck39 shares some properties with other infrared - bright galaxies at high redshift , ms 1512@xmath18cb58 ( yee et al .",
    "1996 ; bechtold et al .",
    "1997 ) , mtm 095355@xmath0545428 ( malkan , teplitz , & mclean 1995 , 1996 ) , hawaii 167 ( cowie et al .",
    "1994 , now known to be a quasar ) , and hr 10 ( graham & dey 1996 ) .",
    "characteristics of these objects are compared in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "all have large apparent star formation rates as compared to the 5 - 100m@xmath6yr@xmath7 typical of young galaxies in the redshift range 1 - 3 found in  dropout",
    " samples ( steidel et al .",
    "1996 ; pettini et al . 1997",
    "; dickinson 1998 ) . if ck39 is a galaxy or ongoing merger - induced starburst , powered solely by photoionization from massive stars , it has one of the highest star formation rates seen in high redshift objects .",
    "graham & dey ( 1996 ) had difficulty reconciling properties of hr10 that are nearly identical to ck39 .",
    "hr10 was discovered because of its color and only later discovered to have a strong emission line ; the opposite is the case for ck39 .",
    "but the emission line made it possible to argue that hr10 could not be an elliptical galaxy as proposed by hu & ridgway ( 1994 ) on the basis of the colors alone , and must contain young stars or an active nucleus .",
    "the irregular shape and the strong rest - frame blue ( observed 1@xmath1 m ) flux density make hr 10 more likely to be a reddened sb galaxy with a@xmath37 1.8 @xmath18 2.5 . although ck39 was discovered first via its emission line , it is also a red object with similar properties and contradictions as hr10 .    correcting the 240 @xmath38 sfr of ck39 for the extinction derived from the red color yields a total sfr which could be as high as 10@xmath11m@xmath6yr@xmath7 .",
    "while the 10kpc separation of the two components is consistent with a relative velocity of 100kms@xmath7 over 0.1gyr , starbursts of this magnitude can not last for long before exhausting their material - an entire elliptical galaxy could be created in 0.1 gyr at the 10@xmath11m@xmath6yr@xmath7 rates implied by the observations .",
    "in addition , the age of the universe at @xmath39 is about 3 gyr for our adopted cosmology .",
    "if the lifetime of the object as observed is only 0.1 gyr , there would have to be roughly 30 times as many of these objects as estimated in table  [ table2 ] to make the probabilities consistent .",
    "the density of the parent population would then be @xmath40mpc@xmath41 , about equal to the number of galaxies brighter than l@xmath27 using the usual schechter function ( schechter 1976 ) .",
    "this density is quite high and would imply that objects like ck39 could account for the bulk of the star formation in the early universe .",
    "many galaxies would create their stars in a few , short but intense bursts .",
    "however , there are currently no well - documented starbursts of this magnitude which have not later been shown to contain an active nucleus , and a number of surveys targetting intense starbursts at high redshift have failed to turn up any significant population of objects .",
    "a viable alternative to a massive starburst , and one which is consistent with the data , is that an agn produces some or all of the h@xmath2+[nii ] emission .",
    "the strength of the h@xmath2+[nii ] line would imply a medium luminosity agn that is quite commonly found at redshifts @xmath92 , and would reduce or eliminate the need to invoke such large star formation rates .",
    "while the line emission in ck39 appears extended in the narrowband image , there are a number of high redshift radio galaxies with significantly extended line emission powered by the active nucleus or radio jets without large amounts of star formation .",
    "the line width is also consistent with agn line widths , as well , and active nuclei are often found in disturbed systems consistent with an ongoing or recent merger .",
    "it is unlikely to find an agn within the survey volume , however ; the a priori probability is of order 0.02 , assuming no extinction at k , a spectral index of -0.5 to give an absolute magnitude m@xmath42 , and bolye s ( 1991 ) luminosity function for quasars .",
    "the original survey ( tmb96 ) specifically targeted the environments around known quasars and radio galaxies , so this probability estimate ignores any possible contributions from clustering . in the keck k - band image ( figure  1 ) ,",
    "both components appear extended , and neither appears strongly dominated by the presence of a point source .",
    "a third possibility is that a faint foreground galaxy or cluster amplifies the line flux from ck39 through gravitational lensing .",
    "the luminous object , fsc 10214@xmath04724 ( rowan - robinson et al . 1991 ) , is an example of how gravitational lensing can distort the interpretation of data taken with low spatial resolution and poor signal - to - noise ratios ( goodrich et al .",
    "1996 ) . to magnify by a factor of order 10",
    ", the foreground galaxy must be almost coincident with ck39 along the line of sight .",
    "the faint r band detection could be such a galaxy and might then redden the light from ck39 .",
    "if so , it would be fainter than typical lensing galaxies found to date .",
    "the keck images show no hint of the arc morphology that describes most strongly lensed objects nor an obvious foreground lens , even though the seeing - limited spatial resolution is quite good , less than 07 .",
    "we note that the apparently symmetric galaxy , ms 1512@xmath18cb58 , exhibits arcs in an hst image and is , therefore , a gravitational lens ( bechtold 1997 , personal communication ) .",
    "the emission line object , tmb 0149 @xmath18 ck39 , appears to be a pair of galaxies undergoing a merger at redshift of 2.4 . if ck39 derives a substantial part of its luminosity from star formation , the formation rate is as high as 1000 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 , an exceptionally large value that is rarely seen in other starforming galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "the system could contain at least one active nucleus , perhaps with some contribution from star formation .",
    "the individual components appear to be 6 and 7 kpc in extent with the centers separated by 10 kpc , consistent with a merger - induced fuelling of the nuclear activity .",
    "an extinction of a@xmath43 is required to produce the observed r - k color of 5.5 , requiring the presence of a significant amount of dust in order to suppress the ultraviolet light and redden the galaxies .",
    "although gravitational lensing by a foreground galaxy or cluster of galaxies could enhance the brightness of the emission , there is little evidence of such a galaxy or cluster along the line of sight .",
    "the growing number of very red galaxies at high redshift indicates that there are new populations uncovered only in infrared surveys ( e.g. graham & dey 1996 ; malkan , teplitz , & mclean 1996 ; and references therein ) . in a separate paper ( thompson et al . in preparation ) , we present statistics that show extremely red objects ( r - k@xmath44 ) have a sky density of order 500 deg@xmath45 for k@xmath30 @xmath4619.75 , so ck39 may , indeed , be part of a larger population .",
    "these results underscore the importance of employing a number of different techniques for exploring the epoch of early star formation and demonstrate that a better understanding of these objects is important to an understanding of galaxy formation in the early universe .",
    "we are grateful to t. herbst and the staff at ukirt for help with the ukirt observations , obtained through the ukirt / mpia collaboration , as well as the staff at the w. m. keck observatory for their support during the keck runs , and to the staff at calar alto for support of the original survey .",
