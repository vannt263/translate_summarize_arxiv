    "truemper configurations play an important role in the proof of several decomposition theorems as explained in a survey of vukovi  @xcite .",
    "let us simply mention here that many decomposition theorems for classes of graphs are proved by studying how some truemper configuration contained in the graph attaches to the rest of the graph , and often , the study relies on the fact that some other truemper configurations are excluded from the class .",
    "the most famous example is perhaps the class of _ perfect graphs_. in these graphs , pyramids are excluded , and how a prism contained in a perfect graphs attaches to the rest of the graph is important in the decomposition theorem for perfect graphs , whose corollary is the celebrated _ strong perfect graph theorem _ due to chudnovksy , robertson , seymour and thomas  @xcite .",
    "see also  @xcite for a survey on perfect graphs , where a section is specifically devoted to truemper configurations .",
    "but many other examples exist , such as the seminal class of chordal graphs  @xcite ( containing no truemper configurations ) , universally signable graphs  @xcite ( also containing no truemper configurations ) , even - hole - free graphs  @xcite ( containing pyramids but not containing thetas and prisms ) , cap - free graphs  @xcite ( not containing prisms and pyramids , but containing thetas ) , isk4-free graphs  @xcite ( containing prisms and thetas but not containing pyramids ) , chordless graphs  @xcite ( containing no prisms , pyramids and wheels , but containing thetas ) , ( theta , triangle)-free graphs  @xcite ( containing no prisms , pyramids and thetas ) , claw - free graphs  @xcite ( containing prisms , but not containing pyramids and thetas ) and bull - free graphs  @xcite ( containing thetas and the prism on six nodes , but not containing pyramids and prisms on at least 7 nodes ) . in most of these classes ,",
    "some wheels are allowed and some are not . in some of them ( notably perfect graphs and even - hole - free graphs ) , the structure of a graph containing a wheel is an important step in the study the class .",
    "let us mention that the classical algorithm lexbfs produces an interesting ordering of the nodes in many classes of graphs where some well - chosen truemper configurations are excluded  @xcite .",
    "let us also mention that many subclasses of wheel - free graphs are well studied , namely unichord - free graphs  @xcite , graphs that do not contain @xmath23 or a subdivision of a wheel as an induced subgraph  @xcite , graphs that do not contain @xmath23 or a wheel as a subgraph  @xcite , propeller - free graphs  @xcite , graphs with no wheel or antiwheel  @xcite and planar wheel - free graphs  @xcite .",
    "all these examples suggest that a systematic study of classes defined by excluding truemper configurations of graphs is of interest .",
    "it might shed a new light on all the classes above and be interesting in its own right .",
    "since there are four types of truemper configurations , there are potentially @xmath24 classes of graphs defined by excluding them ( such as prism - free graphs , ( theta , wheel)-free graphs , and so on ) . in one of them ,",
    "none of the truemper configurations are excluded , so it is the class of all graphs .",
    "we are left with 15 non - trivial classes where at least one type of truemper configuration is excluded .",
    "one case is when all truemper configurations are excluded .",
    "this class is known as the class of _ universally signable graphs _",
    "@xcite and it is well studied : its structure is fully described , and many difficult problems such as graph coloring , and the maximum clique and stable set problems can be solved in polynomial time for this class ( see  @xcite for the most recent algorithms about them ) .",
    "so we are left with 14 classes of graphs , and to the best of our knowledge , they were not studied so far , except for one aspect : the complexity of the recognition problem is known for 11 of them .",
    "let us survey this .",
    "it is convenient to sum up in a table all the 16 classes . in table",
    "[ t : t ] , each line of the table represents a class of graphs defined by excluding some truemper configurations .",
    "the first four columns indicate which truemper configurations are excluded and which are allowed .",
    "the last columns indicates the complexity of the recognition algorithm and a reference to the paper where this complexity is proved .",
    "lines with a reference to a theorem indicate a result proved here .",
    "for instance line  5 of the table should be read as follows : the complexity of deciding whether a graph is in the class of ( theta , prism)-free graphs is @xmath25 ( throughout the paper , @xmath26 stands for the number of nodes , and @xmath27 for the number of edges of the input graph ) .",
    "observe that a recognition algorithm for ( theta , prism@xmath28.)-free graphs is equivalent to an algorithm to decide whether a graph contains a theta _ or _ a prism .",
    "note that all the proofs of np - completeness rely on a variant of a classical construction of bienstock  @xcite .",
    ".detecting truemper configurations[t : t ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as already stated , 13 of the recognition problems of table  [ t : t ] are solved in previous works . in this paper , we solve two of the three remaining problems .",
    "namely , we give a polynomial time recognition algorithm for the following two classes : ( theta , wheel , pyramid)-free and ( theta , wheel , prism)-free graphs . in the first class , the only allowed truemper configuration are prisms , and in the second , the only ones are pyramids .",
    "we therefore use the names _ only - prism _ and _ only - pyramid _ for these two classes .",
    "we believe that for the last class not solved in table  [ t : t ] , namely ( theta , wheel)-free graphs , a similar approach should be successful while being more complicated .",
    "this class is studied in a subsequent paper by the last three authors @xcite .    for each class ,",
    "our recognition algorithm relies on a decomposition theorem for the class . in each case",
    ", this theorem fully describes the structure of the most general graph in the class , and could therefore be used to provide algorithms for several combinatorial optimisation problems .",
    "we note that among the 16 classes described in table  [ t : t ] , only universally signable graphs ( line  0 from the table ) have a decomposition theorem . all the other polynomial time algorithms mentioned in table  [ t : t ]",
    "are based on a direct algorithm to detect the obstruction .    in section  [ sec : mr ] , we give some notation and we describe the results , in particular we state precisely the decomposition theorems proved in the rest of the paper . in section  [ sec :",
