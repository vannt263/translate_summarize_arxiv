    "let @xmath9 , @xmath10 , be a bounded , connected domain with a @xmath11 smooth boundary @xmath12 .",
    "a complex number @xmath13 will be called an interior transmission eigenvalue ( ite ) if the following problem has a non - trivial solution : @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the exterior euclidean unit normal to @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 are strictly positive real - valued functions .",
    "the spectral problem for ( ite ) is related to a non self - adjoint operator @xmath19 ( see section 3 ) and in the isotropic case @xmath20 the boundary problem ( 1.1 ) is not parameter - elliptic . for these reasons many well - known techniques developed for self - adjoint operators or for parameter - elliptic boundary problems are not applicable .",
    "the positive ( ite ) are related to the inverse scattering problems .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath21 is a real ( ite ) , then the far - field operator @xmath22 with kernel the scattering amplitude @xmath23 is not injective and its range is not dense .",
    "this is crucial for the so - called linear sampling method ( see @xcite , @xcite ) which works if we avoid the real ( ite ) . for this reason",
    "the problem of the existence and the discreteness of ( ite ) draw the attention of many authors ( see the survey @xcite for a comprehensive review and a more complete list of references ) .",
    "secondly , it was proved that we can determine the ( ite ) from the far - field operator .",
    "finally , it was established that in some cases the knowledge of all complex ( ite ) determines the index of refraction of the scattering obstacle ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this explains the increasing interest toward ( ite ) and the fact that a lot of papers concerning the existence and the spectral properties of ( ite ) in relation with the inverse scattering problems of reconstruction have been recently published .",
    "on the other hand , the analysis of the ( ite ) leads to some interesting and difficult mathematical spectral problems for non self - adjoint operators .",
    "these problems are connected with two * major questions * : + ( a ) describe the eigenvalue - free regions in the complex plane .",
    "+ ( b ) find a weyl asymptotic of the counting function of the eigenvalues .",
    "+ in contrast to the case of self - adjoint operators these questions are much more difficult and there are no general results . as far as the weyl asymptotics are concerned",
    ", one may study the leading term of the counting function and one can search an optimal remainder . on the other hand , even in the case of boundary problems for non self - adjoint operators which are parameter - elliptic , the weyl asymptotics in the literature concern mainly the leading term ( see @xcite for some results in this direction for non self - adjoint operators ) .",
    "the question ( a ) has been investigated by the second author in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a weaker result ) and the result in @xcite plays an important role in our analysis . in the present paper",
    "our purpose is to study the question ( b ) . under some conditions the ( ite )",
    "form a discrete set in @xmath24 and they have as an accumulation point only infinity ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "introduce the counting function @xmath25 where the eigenvalues are counted with their multiplicity ( see section 3 for the precise definition of the multiplicity ) .",
    "recently , many works concerning the weyl asymptotics of @xmath26 have been published both in the isotropic @xmath27 and anisotropic cases ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "the case when @xmath28 and @xmath29 has been investigated and for @xmath30 a sharp asymptotics of @xmath26 with remainder @xmath31 has been established . in",
    "all other works only the leading term of @xmath26 was obtained .",
    "we should mention that in @xcite the anisotropic case has been studied and the asymptotics of @xmath26 with a remainder is stated .",
    "however , the proof has a gap and only the asymptotics with leading term seems to be correct .",
    "the isotropic case is more difficult since the boundary problem is not parameter - elliptic and the tools for elliptic boundary problems can not be applied . in the isotropic case when @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , it has been recently established in @xcite , @xcite the asymptotics @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are defined below .",
    "it is important to remark that in @xcite , @xcite the analysis is based on the study of some trace class operators leading to an asymptotics @xmath38 where @xmath39 is sufficiently large . combining this asymptotics with the tauberian theorem of hardy and littlewood , one obtains ( 1.2 ) and",
    "the remainder is given by the principal part divided by a logarithmic factor . to obtain a sharper remainder",
    "one could apply a finer tauberain theorem ( see @xcite ) , but for this purpose it is necessary to establish asymptotics like ( 1.3 ) with sharper remainder for @xmath40 lying on certain parabola in @xmath41 .",
    "this , however , seems to be a very difficult problem .    in the present work",
    "we follow another approach inspired by the paper @xcite , where asymptotics have been established for the number of the resonances associated to an exterior transmission boundary problem .",
    "the purpose is to study the asymptotic behavior of @xmath26 under the condition @xmath42 our main result is the following    assume @xmath43 fulfilled .",
    "assume also either the condition @xmath44 or the condition @xmath45 then , the @xmath46 form a discrete set in @xmath47 and we have the following asymptotics @xmath48 for every @xmath49 , where @xmath50 @xmath51 being the volume of the unit ball in @xmath52 , and @xmath53 if @xmath54 holds , @xmath55 if @xmath56 holds . moreover ,",
    "if in addition to @xmath56 we assume either the condition @xmath57 or the condition @xmath58 then @xmath59 holds with @xmath53 .    to prove this theorem we use in an essential way the eigenvalue - free regions obtained in @xcite . in fact , we prove in the present paper a * more general result * saying that if there are no interior transmission eigenvalues in a region of the form @xmath60 then the asymptotics ( 1.7 ) with remainder @xmath61 is true . on the other hand , it is proved in @xcite that under the assumptions of theorem 1.1 , we have indeed an eigenvalue - free region ( 1.10 ) with @xmath62 replaced by @xmath63 , where @xmath62 is given by theorem 1.1 .",
    "note that the parametrix construction of the dirichlet - to - neumann map in @xcite , section 11 , suggests that for strictly concave domains there are reasons to believe that ( 1.10 ) is true with @xmath64 .",
    "hence in this case our argument will imply immediately a better bound of the remainder in ( 1.7 ) .",
    "it is also worth noticing that if we have an eigenvalue - free region of the form ( 1.10 ) with @xmath65 , we get asymptotics with an almost optimal remainder term @xmath66 in ( 1.7 ) .",
    "however , the existence of such an eigenvalue - free region is a very difficult open problem . nevertheless ,",
    "according to our result , the problem of bounding the remainder in the weyl formula for the ( ite ) is reduced to that of getting an eigenvalue - free region in @xmath41 , and a larger eigenvalue - free region yields a sharper bound for the remainder . to our best knowledge",
    ", it seems that our paper is the first one where such a relationship is established .    for reader s convenience , in what follows in this section we will discuss the main steps in the proof of theorem 1.1 .",
    "the starting point of our argument is a trace formula ( see section 3 and ( 3.5 ) ) which allows us to relate the number of the ( ite ) with the number of the eigenvalues , @xmath67 , of two self - adjoint operators for which the weyl asymptotics are known to hold , together with a trace of an operator given by an integral involving a meromorphic operator - valued function , @xmath68 , and its inverse @xmath69 ( see formula ( 3.6 ) ) . the main problem to deal with is to estimate the trace of this integral and it yields the bound @xmath70 of the remainder .",
    "we apply this formula to obtain an asymptotics for the difference @xmath71 , and by a standard argument it is easy to see that this is sufficient to prove ( 1.7 ) .",
    "since it is more convenient to work in the semi - classical setting , we reduce our problem to a semi - classical one by introducing a small parameter @xmath72 .",
    "thus we are going to count the number of points @xmath73 , @xmath74 being an ( ite ) , in a region of the form @xmath75 provided we have an eigenvalue - free region ( 1.10 ) with @xmath63 in place of @xmath62 ( see proposition 3.7 ) .",
    "this requires to make a change of variables @xmath76 in the trace formula ( 3.6 ) and to study the behavior of the integral term when @xmath77 and @xmath78 next we construct a meromorphic function @xmath79 with poles among the points @xmath80 and such that if an ( ite ) , @xmath81 , does not belong to the set @xmath82 , then @xmath83 is a zero of @xmath79 and the multiplicities of the corresponding zeros of @xmath79 and ( ite ) agree .",
    "it should be mentioned that the construction of the function @xmath79 is not trivial and it requires to build a semi - classical parametrix for the corresponding dirichlet - to - neumann map @xmath84 in the elliptic zone .",
    "this is carried out in section 2 by using the parametrix construction in @xcite .",
    "the estimate of the remainder is reduced to that of the integral @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a suitable closed contour chosen so that on @xmath87 we have neither zeros nor poles of @xmath79 .",
    "the main property of the function @xmath79 is the estimate @xmath88 provided the distance between @xmath89 and the set @xmath80 is greater than @xmath90 , @xmath91 being arbitrary ( see lemma 3.4 ) .",
    "this estimate plays a crucial role in the estimate of ( 1.11 ) .",
    "next in lemma 3.5 we show that for @xmath92 we also have @xmath93 moreover , the function @xmath94 is holomorphic in @xmath95 , @xmath96 and satisfies the bound @xmath97 in the domain @xmath98 the next step consists of choosing a closed contour @xmath99 , where @xmath100 are linear segments parallel to the real axis .",
    "for the integrals over @xmath101 we apply ( 1.12 ) and one gets @xmath102 we take @xmath103 \\cup \\tilde{\\gamma}_j \\cup [ \\tilde{w}_j^{+ } , w_j^{+}],\\ : j = 1,2 $ ] with suitable contours @xmath104 ( see section 3 for the notation ) .",
    "the estimates of the imaginary parts of the integrals over @xmath105 are more delicate since these contours cross the positive real axis and we must avoid the points @xmath106 .",
    "our argument is similar to the choice of the contour in @xcite and the details are given in section 3 .",
    "the main point is lemma 3.8 , where the contours @xmath104 are constructed so that @xmath107 combining this with ( 1.13 ) , we obtain the statement of proposition 3.7 and by scaling we get the asymptotics of @xmath108 + * acknowledgment . * thanks are due to the referee for the comments and remarks concerning the initial version of the paper .",
