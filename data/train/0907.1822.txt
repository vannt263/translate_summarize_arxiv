    "many phenomena of wave propagation in one dimensional media in various physical contexts are modelled by systems of partial differential equations ( pdes ) . among them , integrable models are of special interest and are the focus of our investigation .",
    "in fact the present article follows our work @xcite to which we refer the reader for the general background and motivations .",
    "our interest in this subject is particularly motivated by the introduction and investigation of boomeron solutions in models of interest in nonlinear optics .",
    "these solutions are soliton solutions whose behavior differs from that of standard solitons ( such as for the kdv and nls equations ) .",
    "in fact they have different asymptotic velocities at @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "they were first introduced long time ago in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in connection with the hierarchy of the matrix korteweg  de vries equation , and more recently boomerons appeared again in geometry @xcite and optics @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the special properties of boomerons stem from the fact that they are solutions of multicomponent field equations whose integrability requires a matrix formulation of the corresponding lax pair ( see below ) together with a richer ( non commutative ) algebraic structure .",
    "the characteristic property of this structure is that the flows of the attached hierarchy may not commute with each others ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the technique of constructing soliton solutions we adopt here goes via the darboux  dressing transformations ( ddt ) which yield a new ( _ dressed _ ) solution from a given ( _ naked _ or _ seed _ ) solution of the system of wave equations of interest .",
    "this method may be formulated as a change of the lax pair of linear equations via a transformation which adds one pole to the dependence of its solution on the complex spectral variable .",
    "though the formal setting of this construction is well known ( @xcite@xcite ) , the actual construction is detailed in @xcite where the explicit algorithmic procedure is given .",
    "in particular , there we show that the position of the pole , whether it lies off or on the real axis , leads to different expressions of the dressed solution . in its turn , as we show here , this difference plays a crucial role in accounting for different boundary values of the wave fields , namely boundary values which are appropriate to bright solitons ( localised pulses with exponential decay ) or dark solitons ( localised pulses in a non vanishing background ) . to the aim of making this article",
    "as much self  contained as possible , in this first section we set up the general formalism of matrix evolution equations we have introduced in @xcite by keeping the same notation as introduced there . in section 2 the ddt construction , which is discussed in details in @xcite ,",
    "is tersely reported .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the soliton expressions of both bright and dark type in the general matrix form . however , as for the investigation of these expressions , we prefer to focus on one particular reduction .",
    "this and other reductions lead to models which seem to deserve special attention because of their potential applicability .",
    "thus section 4 is devoted to novel simulton solutions of the well know system which describes the interaction of three waves in quadratic media with the resonant condition @xmath2 and @xmath3 on their frequencies and wave numbers , respectively .",
    "the last section 5 contains few remarks and conclusions .",
    "the starting point of our investigation is the following lax pair of matrix ordinary differential equations ( odes ) : @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are @xmath8 square matrices , @xmath9 being a common solution of the two linear odes ( [ lax ] ) , while @xmath10 and @xmath11 depend on the coordinate @xmath12 , the time @xmath13 and the complex spectral parameter @xmath14 according to the definitions    @xmath15    @xmath16\\ , ,   \\end{array}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 $ ] stands for the commutator @xmath18 .",
    "we notice that , in order to semplify our analysis , we have chosen the @xmath6 and @xmath7 matrices to be first degree in the spectral variable @xmath14 .",
    "this choice has two consequences , namely it lets the two independent variables @xmath12 and @xmath13 play a similar role so that their interpretation as _ space _ and _ time _ can change according to the physical application , and , secondly , it leads to wave equations which are dispersionless when linearized around the vanishing solution .",
    "dispersion terms can be easily introduced with only technical changes of the method ( see @xcite where the dispersive term of schrdinger type has been considered ) . in the equations ( [ lax ] )",
    "@xmath19 is the diagonal constant matrix @xmath20 while @xmath21 is an arbitrary constant block  diagonal matrix , @xmath22 where @xmath23 , respectively @xmath24 , are @xmath25 respectively @xmath26 constant square matrices , with @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 being arbitrary positive integers .",
    "the _ potentials _ @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the off - diagonal and , respectively , diagonal block matrices ( a superimposed dagger stands for hermitian conjugation ) @xmath32 where the block @xmath33 is a rectangular @xmath34 matrix while the two blocks @xmath35 are square @xmath36 matrices .",
    "moreover @xmath37 and @xmath38 are , respectively , @xmath39 and @xmath40 diagonal matrices whose diagonal elements @xmath41 , with no loss of generality , are just signs , namely @xmath42 the compatibility of the two odes ( [ lax ] ) entails the matrix first order differential equations    [ redboomeron ] @xmath43 @xmath44 , \\ ] ] @xmath45 , \\ ] ]    provided the square @xmath36 matrices @xmath46 and @xmath35 satisfy the conditions @xmath47 and @xmath48 the reduced form ( [ qwblock ] ) of the matrix @xmath49 is well motivated by the fact that it captures several interesting models of multicomponent wave interactions in weakly nonlinear media , see @xcite , @xcite and sections 4 and 5 .",
    "the method of construction of explicit solutions of the lax equations ( [ lax ] ) , and therefore of the nonlinear evolution equations ( [ redboomeron ] ) , may be formulated in more than one way @xcite@xcite . here",
    "we sketch the scheme we developed in @xcite where full details are given .",
    "let @xmath50 and @xmath51 be a pair of matrices with the same block structure ( [ qwblock ] ) of @xmath49 and @xmath52 .",
    "this assumption defines therefore also the block matrices @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "let then @xmath55 be a corresponding nonsingular ( i.e. with nonvanishing determinant ) matrix solution of @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 have the expressions ( [ xlaxoperator ] ) and ( [ tlaxoperator ] ) whit @xmath59 and @xmath60 replaced by @xmath61 and @xmath62 . since both compatibility conditions , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are satisfied , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are just two different solutions of the same matrix evolution equations ( [ redboomeron ] ) .",
    "consider now the matrix @xmath67 or , equivalently , the relation @xmath68 which can be viewed as a transformation @xmath69 .",
    "the ddt method consists in searching for the dressing matrix @xmath70 for a given @xmath71 .",
    "the expression of the matrix @xmath70 is found by assigning _",
    "a priori _ its explicit dependence on the spectral parameter @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that this transformation is near identity and adds one simple pole to the @xmath72dependence of the solution @xmath55 , namely @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the residue matrix and the parameter @xmath75 is the pole position in the complex plane of the spectral variable @xmath14 . in @xcite",
    "we derive the expression of the residue matrix @xmath74 and we show that this expression crucially depends on the position of the pole @xmath76 , the distinction being between the case in which the pole is off the real axis , @xmath77 , and the case in which the pole is on the real axis , @xmath78 . in the next section we show that this distinction is relevant when constructing soliton solutions with vanishing or non vanishing asymptotic values of @xmath79 as @xmath80 . here",
    "we merely report the following expression of the new solution @xmath79 , @xmath81 in these two cases :    [ realbacklundcompl ] @xmath82 @xmath83}{\\mathcal{e}(x , t)}\\,\\,.\\ ] ]    @xmath84 is the sign matrix ( [ signs ] ) , @xmath85 is the @xmath86 constant matrix as defined in ( [ cmatrices ] ) with the condition ( [ cond1 ] ) and the @xmath87dimensional vector @xmath88 is defined below , see ( [ czsolution ] ) .",
    "the difference between the two cases is mainly in the expression of the real denominator function @xmath89 .",
    "thus when the pole @xmath75 is complex with non vanishing imaginary part ( i.e. @xmath77 ) , the denominator becomes @xcite @xmath90 \\,\\,\\,,\\ ] ] while , if the pole @xmath75 is real ( i.e. @xmath91 ) , the expression of the denominator is quite different from the previous one and reads @xcite @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are arbitrary real constants and the scalar functions @xmath95 and @xmath96 are defined by the expressions @xmath97 moreover , in this second case , i.e. @xmath98 , the two vectors @xmath99 and @xmath100 are constrained by the relation @xmath101 , which is a consequence of the reduction conditions ( [ qwblock ] ) , ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ condw ] ) ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the bracket @xmath102 in the previous formulae stands for the ( nonsymmetrical ) scalar product of two vectors , @xmath103 and the vectors @xmath99 and @xmath100 are @xmath28dimensional and , respectively , @xmath29dimensional .",
    "they are defined by the explicit block expression @xmath104 where the two complex vectors @xmath105 and @xmath106 are constant in both cases ; they are arbitrary if @xmath77 while , if @xmath98 is real , these constant vectors have to meet the same condition satisfied by @xmath99 and @xmath100 , namely @xmath107 as for the expression ( [ rdenom ] ) , we observe that , because of the conservation law @xmath108 , the differential form @xmath109 is exact and therefore the denominator expression ( [ rdenom ] ) can be computed as the integral @xmath110\\ ] ] along any curve in the @xmath111 plane .",
    "we end this section noticing that these explicit formulas are meant to serve as the main tools to construct soliton and , by repeated application of ddts , multisoliton  solutions of those systems of multicomponent wave equations which can be obtained by reduction of the general matrix pdes ( [ redboomeron ] ) .",
    "however , they have been obtained by algebra and local integration of differential equations by leaving out two important ingredients of solutions of applicative interest , namely their boundary values and their boundedness .",
    "these two issues will be addressed in the next sections where explicit expressions of solutions will be displayed .",
    "we construct now explicit solutions of the general matrix equation ( [ redboomeron ] ) by means of ddt s .",
    "the general expressions we derive here will be investigated in more details in particular cases in the next section . in the present analysis ,",
    "the matrix  valued function @xmath79 , which appears in the spectral equation @xmath112 , with ( [ xlaxoperator ] ) and ( [ qwblock ] ) , is restricted to be in one of two different functional classes .",
    "the first one is the class @xmath113 of those ( bounded ) functions @xmath79 which vanish sufficiently fast , for any @xmath13 , as @xmath80 : @xmath114 bright solitons are in this class .",
    "we point out here that , if @xmath79 is in @xmath113 , the matrices @xmath81 which satisfy the equations ( [ wplus ] ) and ( [ wminus ] ) are necessarily @xmath12independent ( possibly @xmath13dependent ) when @xmath80",
    ". in particular we choose @xmath115 @xmath116 being two arbitrary constant matrices .",
    "we limit our construction to the one soliton solution which obtains by choosing in the ddt algorithm the seed solution as the trivial solution @xmath117 .",
    "the second class , @xmath118 , is the class of those ( bounded ) functions @xmath79 which do not vanish as @xmath119 , as they asymptotically behave like _ plane waves _ : @xmath120 where the functions @xmath121 and @xmath122 are two generally different plane wave solutions of ( [ redboomeron ] ) .",
    "if @xmath79 is in this class , also the two matrices @xmath81 which satisfy the equations ( [ wplus ] ) and ( [ wminus ] ) behave as plane waves , as shown below .",
    "the explicit expression of plane wave solutions is reported below , but its computation requires some tedious algebra which is not reported here .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the plane wave solutions can be solutions only of two special cases of the general evolution equations ( [ redboomeron ] ) .",
    "the first ( second ) case obtains by requiring that the constant matrix @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is proportional to the identity matrix with the consequence that the matrix @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) is constant , see ( [ wplus ] ) ( see ( [ wminus ] ) ) .",
    "however in this case both @xmath23 and @xmath123 ( @xmath24 and @xmath124 ) can be easily transformed away so that setting @xmath125 reduces the system ( [ redboomeron ] ) to the two coupled equations    [ redboomeronminus ] @xmath126 @xmath127 , \\ ] ]    while , in the second case , namely @xmath128 , the system ( [ redboomeron ] ) reduces to the two coupled equations    [ redboomeronplus ] @xmath129 @xmath130 \\,\\,.\\ ] ]    moreover , we apply a similarity transformation to the equations ( [ redboomeronminus ] ) ( ( [ redboomeronplus ] ) ) in such a way that the nonvanishing matrix @xmath24 ( @xmath23 ) be diagonal ( and real , see ( [ cond1 ] ) ) @xmath131 in the first case , and @xmath132 in the second case .",

    "a word of warning is appropriate .",

    "this analysis is quite simple in the scalar case , while in the matrix case , which we are presently dealing with , it requires some effort .",
    "here we limit our attention to the case in which the seed solution @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the simplest solution of the functional class to which @xmath53 belongs . as a consequence",

    "@xmath75 introduced by the ddt , see ( [ elementaryddt ] ) , we point out that its position , whether on the real axis or off the real axis , depends on the boundary values of @xmath79 which characterize the functional classes @xmath113 and @xmath118 .",
    "indeed , in the construction of soliton solutions the pole @xmath75 has a spectral meaning since it belongs to the discrete spectrum of the lax operator @xmath196 , see the spectral equation ( [ lax ] ) with ( [ xlaxoperator ] ) . in general , if @xmath79 belongs to the class @xmath113 , then the discrete spectrum of the operator @xmath197 can not be on the real axis and only darboux matrices @xmath198 with @xmath199 may give rise to physically meaningful solutions . on the other hand , if @xmath79 belongs instead to the class @xmath118 , then the correspending operator @xmath197 may have gaps of the continuum spectrum on the real axis . in this case , the darboux transformation , with @xmath200 lying in one of these gaps , yields meaningful solutions .",

    "however we skip such details and we limit our present discussion to the observation that the spectrum can have at most _ two _ gaps .",

    "therefore , if the four roots of @xmath424 are all complex ( i.e. with a non vanishing imaginary part ) then there are no gaps in the spectrum .",
    "if instead only two roots are real , @xmath425 , @xmath426 , the spectrum has one gap @xmath427 with these two roots @xmath428 being the endpoints of the gap interval . finally , if all roots of @xmath424 are real , @xmath429 , @xmath430 , the spectrum has two gaps , @xmath431 and @xmath432 ( see fig .",

    "this common velocity is obtained via the definition of the variable @xmath446 , which implies im@xmath447=pv , and it takes the expression ( see ( [ 3wrinu ] ) ) @xmath448 this expression is not explicit since it gives @xmath445 in terms of the eigenvalue @xmath436 ; we note however that it implies the following :    * proposition 9 *  : if we assume , for definiteness , the ordering @xmath449 , then , according to the signs @xmath388 and @xmath389 , we find that @xmath450 @xmath451 @xmath452    [ fig1 ]    the results of proposition 9 are a strait consequence of the relation @xmath453 which follows from the imaginary part of the equation @xmath454 this being just the present case form of ( [ eigenchi ] ) .",
    "we also note that the relation ( [ iden ] ) shows again that this soliton solution does not exists if @xmath393 .",
    "figure 2 shows an example in which only one gap is present .",
    "if two gaps @xmath455 and @xmath456 exist , where @xmath457 is characterised by @xmath458 , the results are similar , e.g. in the case of @xmath390 the velocity of the simulton @xmath445 lies in an interval when @xmath75 varies in the gaps ; however the function @xmath459 ( together with its range of values ) is different in the two gaps ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "[ fig2 ]    finally , it should be pointed out that this solution , as explicitly shown by ( [ ddd ] ) , describes the nonlinear interaction of three plane waves whose amplitudes asymptotically , namely at @xmath460 , acquire a phase  shift .",

    "shifts is explicitly given by the general formula ( [ theta ] ) which now reads @xmath461 as an instance , the dependence of the phase  shifts @xmath462 and @xmath463 on the parameter @xmath75 inside the gap , @xmath464 , is plotted in figure 4 .    [ fig3 ]    similarly , if there exist two gaps @xmath455 and @xmath456 we observe that the behaviour of the phases @xmath462 and @xmath463 as functions of @xmath75 is different in the two gaps .",

    "this matrix generalization has been recently revisited in @xcite and @xcite and further generalized in order to derive integrable matrix partial differential equations with matrix , rather than scalar , coefficients .",
    "this generalization generates new integrable systems whose soliton dynamics may have peculiar properties which are known as boomeronic and are different from those of standard solitons . in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we have adapted the standard darboux dressing method to construct soliton solutions for a class of boomeronic  type equations . in this paper",

    "since they are first order differential equations any nonsingular linear coordinate transformation of the @xmath374 plane in itself leaves these equations formally covariant .",

    "indeed in our present dressing construction , the two linear equations of the lax pair ( [ lax ] ) have been treated on the same foot .",
    "instead , the solution of the initial value problem requires that one of the two lax equations plays the role of the spectral problem which provides the spectral fourier ",
    "type data , while the other linear equation entails the evolution of such data . in this respect",
    "we point out that the initial value problem associated to the variable @xmath13 as evolution variable ( _ time _ in the usual physical meaning ) is still unsolved .",
