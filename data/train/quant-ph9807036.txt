    "the extreme low temperature required for the observation of bose - einstein condensation alkali vapors is a major achievement of present day experimentation @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the temperature itself is not directly observable .",
    "it has to be estimated from other , more accessible properties of the system , such as the velocity distribution of the vapor @xcite . because of the uncertainty relation between the inverse temperature and the energy of the system for a finite number of particles , it is not clear _ a priori _ how many particles",
    "are required for a reasonable thermodynamically defined concept of temperature . in the present paper",
    ", we do not address this fundamental question , but rather assume that the number of bosons in the system is sufficiently large to have a meaningful definition of the temperature .    under this assumption ,",
    "the experimental estimate of the temperature@xcite is based on the hypothesis that the momentum distribution function is maxwell - boltzmann like , at least for sufficiently high momentum .",
    "this hypothesis deserves further investigation and quantitative comparison to the momentum distribution of a parabolically confined bose - einstein gas . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the bose - einstein momentum distribution in a parabolic confinement potential has not been documented before .    using the methods for path integration developed in @xcite",
    ", we have been able to calculate the momentum distribution function of a gas of parabolically confined bosons with quadratic harmonic interparticle interactions .",
    "this calculation is presented in sec .",
    "other investigations using the same methodology @xcite indicated that for weakly interacting systems , such as @xmath0rb and @xmath1na , the interaction slightly influences the parameters involved in the model system , and therefore have only a moderate influence the momentum distribution .    in section iii ,",
    "the approximations are examined which lead to the maxwellian momentum distribution function , and a quantitative comparison is made between the temperature obtained in the bose - einstein distribution and the estimate of the temperature , obtained by fitting a maxwell - boltzmann distribution to the tail of the measured velocity distribution .",
    "the conclusion from this analysis is that the estimate from the maxwellian deviates substantially from the temperature of the bose - einstein distribution in the presence of a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "the anisotropic one - body potential energy @xmath2 and the two - body potential energy @xmath3 of the model system consisting of @xmath4 bosons are given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the position of the @xmath7th boson , @xmath8 is the mass of the bosons and @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the frequencies of the parabolic confinement in the @xmath11-plane and along the @xmath12-axis , respectively .",
    "the model interparticle interaction is harmonic with frequency @xmath13 and can be either attractive (  ) or repulsive ( + ) .",
    "the renormalized frequencies in the @xmath11-plane and along the @xmath12-axis will be denoted by @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "these frequencies are the eigenfrequencies of the internal degrees of freedom of the boson gas , whereas the confining frequencies @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the eigenfrequencies for the center - of - mass motion . the momentum distribution @xmath16 , giving the statistical mean number of bosons with a given momentum @xmath17 in the canonical ensemble , can be written as @xmath18 where the angular brackets indicate quantum averages for boson statistics .",
    "these mean values can be calculated for a system at temperature @xmath19 using the path integral propagator in momentum space @xmath20 : @xmath21    the calculation of the momentum distribution , analogous to the calculation of the spatial density distribution @xmath22 in @xcite , can be summarized as follows .",
    "first the propagator in momentum space is evaluated by a fourier transform of the corresponding propagator in position space obtained in @xcite .",
    "this results in    @xmath23    with @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the total momentum , and @xmath26 is the one - particle propagator in momentum space for a particle in an anisotropic harmonic potential .",
    "next , the sum over permutations appearing in the expression ( [ meanval ] ) for the mean value @xmath27 is transformed into a cyclic sum ( with @xmath28 the number of cycles of length @xmath29 ) .",
    "the cyclic summation can be performed for the generating function @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the partition sum .",
    "the result of the cyclic summation is @xmath32 \\right\\ } } { 8\\sinh \\left ( \\ell \\beta \\hbar w_z/2\\right ) \\sinh ^2\\left ( \\ell \\beta \\hbar w_{xy}/2\\right ) } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the expectation value @xmath27 for @xmath4 bosons can then be derived in closed form from the generating functional @xmath33 by collecting all the terms with the same power in @xmath34 : @xmath35 \\right\\ } } { 8\\sinh \\left ( \\ell \\beta \\hbar w_z/2\\right ) \\sinh ^2\\left ( \\ell \\beta \\hbar w_{xy}/2\\right ) } .",
    "\\label{expval}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , the momentum distribution ( [ veld ] ) is found as a fourier transform of the expectation value ( [ expval ] ) .",
    "the result is : @xmath36 with @xmath37 .\\ ] ] in figure 1 this momentum distribution is shown at different temperatures for an isotropically confined bose gas with @xmath38 and consisting of 1000 bosons .",
    "the momentum distribution for @xmath39 is qualitatively similar to the distribution with @xmath40 shown in figure 1 . in the inset",
    ", the value of the momentum distribution in the origin is shown as a function of the temperature .",
    "as the temperature is lowered below the condensation temperature , the momentum distribution becomes more pronounced in the origin : the average number of bosons with momentum zero rises sharply .",
    "the momentum distribution ( [ exact ] ) calculated in the previous section for a gas of parabolically confined bosons can be related to the maxwell distribution through a series of approximations .",
    "first , in the case of a non - interacting ( @xmath41 ) , parabolically confined boson gas the momentum distribution ( [ exact ] ) becomes @xmath42 furthermore , according to feynman @xcite , the maxwell - boltzman statistics can be recovered by considering only the cycles of length @xmath43 in the cyclic summations of ( [ exact ] ) .",
    "this means that permutations involving cycles of length larger than 1 play no role any more .",
    "hence the momentum distribution function for distinguishable non - interacting particles in a parabolic potential is : @xmath44 if moreover the parabolic confinement were neglected , which corresponds to @xmath45 in ( [ vclas ] ) , one finally would be left with the maxwell - boltzmann momentum distribution for free particles : @xmath46    in experiments on bose - einstein condensed atomic vapors ( e.g. @xcite ) , the temperature of a cloud of parabolically trapped bosons was estimated by fitting the _ maxwell - boltzmann distribution _ _  _ ( [ max ] ) to the tail of the experimentally measured momentum distribution @xmath47 .",
    "this can be done by first choosing a sufficiently large threshold momentum @xmath48 such that atoms with a momentum larger than @xmath48 do not belong to the bose - einstein condensate , and  then minimizing @xmath49 with respect to the temperature @xmath50 appearing in the maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "the temperature obtained by this minimization will be denoted as @xmath51 and the procedure will be referred to as the `` maxwell - boltzmann fit procedure '' .",
    "since the maxwell - boltzmann momentum distribution is a rather crude approximation to the momentum distribution ( [ vid ] ) of a gas of non - interacting , parabolically trapped bosons , we rather propose to determine the temperature by fitting @xmath52 to the momentum distribution ( [ vid ] ) derived in the present paper .",
    "this is done by minimizing @xmath53 with respect to the temperature @xmath54 appearing in the momentum distribution @xmath55 for non - interacting , parabolically trapped bosons .",
    "we will denote this procedure as the `` bose - einstein fit procedure '' and the resulting temperature as @xmath56 .    in order to compare the maxwell - boltzmann fit procedure with the bose - einstein fit procedure , we applied the former on a momentum distribution simulated with @xmath55 ( @xmath57 for weakly interacting bosons ) , at a given temperature @xmath56 .",
    "that is , @xmath58 was minimized with respect to @xmath51 , keeping @xmath59 and @xmath48 fixed .",
    "the result @xmath51 of the minimization is compared to @xmath56 in figure 2 , where the ratio @xmath60 is shown as a function of @xmath56 at a fixed threshold momentum @xmath61 . in the bose - einstein condensed phase the discrepancy between @xmath56 and @xmath51 increases",
    "when the number of bosons increases , whereas for @xmath62{n/\\zeta \\left ( 3\\right ) } , $ ] the discrepancy decreases when the number of bosons is augmented , as shown in the inset of figure 2 . for temperatures well above the condensation temperature @xmath63 , the ratio @xmath64 is small , and the maxwell - boltzmann fit procedure gives a reliable temperature estimate in this high - temperature regime .",
    "the difference between @xmath56 and @xmath51 becomes appreciable below the condensation temperature @xmath63 .",
    "the present analysis therefore shows that @xmath60 is not negligible in the bose - einstein condensed phase and that the bose - einstein fit procedure is more appropriate than the maxwell - boltzmann fit procedure for the determination of the temperature .",
    "in this paper , we calculated the momentum distribution function ( [ exact ] ) for a bose gas in an anisotropic parabolic trapping potential , including quadratic interparticle interactions . in the absence of interparticle interactions",
    ", this momentum distribution simplifies to the momentum distribution function ( [ vid ] ) of an ideal boson gas in a harmonic confining potential .",
    "the maxwell - boltzmann distribution ( [ max ] ) follows from ( [ vid ] ) by the further simplifications of neglecting the boson statistics and the parabolic confinement .",
    "the underlying assumption in these derivations is that the number of bosons is sufficiently large to maintain the temperature concept from the thermodynamical limit .",
    "assuming furthermore thermodynamical equilibrium , two temperature estimates were compared . since the temperature estimates used in experiments on bose - einstein condensed atomic vapors ( e.g. @xcite ) , are obtained by fitting the maxwell - boltzmann distribution _  _ ( [ max ] ) to the tail of the experimentally measured momentum distribution @xmath65 we derived the corresponding temperature @xmath51 by fitting the large - momentum tail of the maxwell - boltzmann distribution to the large - momentum tail of the momentum distribution of the bose gas ( [ vid ] ) .",
    "this temperature estimate was compared to the temperature @xmath56 in the momentum distribution of the boson gas .",
    "we find that @xmath51 substantially deviates from the correct temperature @xmath56 in the bose - einstein condensed phase , and hence that the bose - einstein fit procedure is more appropriate than the maxwell - boltzmann fit procedure for the determination of the temperature .",
