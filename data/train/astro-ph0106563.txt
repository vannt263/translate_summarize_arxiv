    "in the first two papers of this series ( sandage & lubin 2001 , hereafter paper i ; lubin & sandage 2001a , hereafter paper ii ) , we review the tolman ( 1930 , 1934 ) surface brightness test for the reality of the expansion . in paper",
    "i , we present the calibration of the diagnostic diagrams at zero redshift of mean surface brightness @xmath9 , absolute magnitude @xmath10 , and linear radius r at various petrosian ( 1976 ) @xmath3 metric radii .",
    "the petrosian @xmath3 function is defined as the difference in magnitude between the mean surface brightness averaged over the area interior to a particular radius and the surface brightness at that radius .",
    "the unique properties of this function in defining a metric size , which is essential when comparing parameters of galaxies at different redshifts , are described in detail in  2 of paper i. for the local calibrations , we have used the photometric data of postman & lauer ( 1995 ) for first ranked cluster galaxies in 118 low redshift abell clusters . in paper ii , we describe the effect on the profile data of finite angular resolution and the differences in the diagnostic diagrams for early - type galaxies of different flattening ratios .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to measure the three galaxy parameters of mean surface brightness @xmath9 , apparent magnitude @xmath11 , and angular radius @xmath12 as a function of the petrosian radius @xmath3 for early - type galaxies at high redshift .",
    "we have obtained this galaxy sample from the three high - redshift clusters cl 1324 + 3011 ( @xmath0 ) , cl 1604 + 4304 ( @xmath1 ) , and cl 1604 + 4321 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "these clusters were observed with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) by postman , lubin , and oke as discussed by oke , postman & lubin ( 1998 , hereafter opl ) , postman , lubin & oke ( 1998 , 2001 ; hereafter , plo98 and plo01 ) , and lubin et al .",
    "( 1998 , 2001 ) .",
    "we have used their extensive photometric data for the present paper . the sample selection and the methods of calculating the @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 functions for these galaxies",
    "are given in  2 .",
    "the method of calculating the photometric @xmath5 corrections in the cape / cousins @xmath16 photometric system is given in  3 .",
    "the surface brightnesses and apparent magnitudes in @xmath6 for the clusters cl 1324 + 3011 and cl 1604 + 4304 have been corrected by the @xmath17 correction to the rest - frame @xmath6 system . the data in @xmath7 for cl 1604 + 4321 have been corrected by @xmath18 to the rest - frame @xmath7 system .",
    "these data listed in tables 57 are free from all cosmological assumptions as to world model ; however , for the analysis in lubin & sandage ( 2001b , hereafter paper",
    "iv ) the absolute magnitude ( @xmath10 ) and linear radius ( r ) values , each which require knowledge of the deceleration parameter @xmath19 , are needed for the comparison of the high - redshift data with the calibrations of the diagnostic diagrams of paper i. because the basic observational data in the present paper are cosmological - model free , whereas the analysis in paper iv is not , we have separated the discussions into the two papers ( iii here , and iv ) to emphasize the difference between the data source presented in this paper with its analysis in paper iv .",
    "the observations by oke , postman & lubin ( 1998 ) of the three clusters were made both with the keck 10-meter telescopes and with hst .",
    "the ccd observations at keck were made in the four photometric passbands that are close to , but not identical with , the standard @xmath20 system of johnson and the @xmath16 system of cape / cousins ( see figure 1 of opl ) .",
    "the data on the natural keck system were reduced to the standard @xmath8 systems by observing selected standard stars measured by landolt ( 1992 ) .",
    "these were chosen to be adequately faint in order not to saturate in the short keck exposures that were taken to determine the color equations .",
    "the importance of the keck @xmath8 data for these high - redshift galaxies is that the extended color range permits the choice of an appropriate synthetic spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of each galaxy from the library of evolved sed models of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) .",
    "these evolved rest - frame seds have been used to calculate the @xmath18 and @xmath17 corrections in  3 .",
    "the profile data needed for the calculation of the mean surface brightness @xmath9 , apparent magnitude @xmath11 , and angular radius @xmath12 at various @xmath3 values were obtained using hst for the same galaxies observed at the keck telescopes .",
    "clusters cl 1324 + 3011 ( @xmath0 ) and cl 1604 + 4304 ( @xmath1 ) were observed using the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) in the @xmath21 bandpass , while cluster cl 1604 + 4321 ( @xmath2 ) was observed in the @xmath22 bandpass .",
    "the color and magnitude equations between these hst filter systems and the standard cape / cousins ( @xmath16 ) systems are    @xmath23    and    @xmath24    these equations are the linear approximations to the quadratic equations of holtzman et al .",
    "they are accurate to better than 0.01 mag .",
    "the sense of equation ( 1 ) is that the @xmath7 magnitudes are fainter than the @xmath22 magnitudes by 0.32 mag at @xmath25 , which is the observed mean ( @xmath26 ) color of the galaxies in the three clusters ( see tables 57 ) .",
    "the sense of equation ( 2 ) is that the @xmath6 magnitudes are brighter by 0.05 mag than the @xmath21 magnitudes of hst in the relevant color range of the galaxies presented here .",
    "system of magnitudes differs substantially from the johnson @xmath27 system ( johnson 1964 , 1965 ; johnson et al .",
    "1966 ) , which is the same as the @xmath28 system introduced by sandage & smith ( 1963 ) .",
    "@xmath29 is also the system used by sandage ( 1973 , paper v of the redshift - distance series ) for the palomar program on the hubble diagram for brightest cluster galaxies .",
    "the difference between the cape / cousins @xmath7 and @xmath27 is a function of @xmath30 given by equations ( 25 ) and ( 26 ) in sandage ( 1997 ) . in the color range of interest for early type galaxies ( i.e.  @xmath31 to 1.1 ) ,",
    "the johnson / sandage magnitudes are 0.25 mag brighter than the cape / cousins @xmath7 magnitudes .",
    "this difference must be taken into account when comparing the aperture photometry of postman & lauer ( 1995 ) , which is on the cape / cousins @xmath7 system , with that of sandage ( 1973 ) , which is on the @xmath27 system , for cluster galaxies in common to both studies . ]      to complete the tolman test , we require a comparison of high - redshift galaxies with the postman & lauer ( 1995 ) sample of nearby early - type galaxies . therefore , we have selected our high - redshift sample by choosing only those galaxies which are ( 1 ) morphologically classified as early - type galaxies and ( 2 ) confirmed members of the three clusters . to satisfy the first criteria , each galaxy had to be morphologically classified from the high - angular - resolution hst images as an early - type , either an elliptical or s0 , galaxy by the classifiers in lubin et al .",
    "( 1998 , 2001 ) .    for the second criteria , the galaxy had either to be a spectroscopically - confirmed cluster member with an elliptical - like ( k - star absorption ) spectrum , or to have the broad - band colors characteristic of an early - type galaxy at the cluster redshift .",
    "the latter criteria essentially uses a photometric redshift technique to identify cluster members ( for details , see brunner & lubin 2000 ) . in tables 57",
    ", we mark those galaxies which are selected based on their photometric , rather than their spectroscopic , redshifts .",
    "the resulting samples contain 13 , 7 , and 14 galaxies in the clusters cl 1324 + 3011 , cl 1604 + 4304 , and cl 1604 + 4321 , respectively .",
    "the two - dimensional hst data were analyzed by the method of ellipse fitting described in  2 of paper ii .",
    "optimized ellipses ( i.e.  using all the data around the bounding , iterated elliptical contours with optimized pixel width ) were fitted to the data by the profile - fitting iraf task ellipse .",
    "these fits produce intensities at a series of increasing radii that could be quantified in several ways .",
    "the profile intensities can be listed at ( 1 ) the semi - major axis , @xmath32 , of each ellipse , ( 2 ) the `` effective '' circular radius , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the semi - minor axis , or ( 3 ) some intermediate radius such as that at @xmath35 from the major axis which has sometimes been used in the literature .    in  4 of paper ii",
    "we showed that measuring the growth curve using circular apertures was equivalent to using the profile data obtained from the iraf task ellipse , integrating the data within circular areas of an `` effective '' radius , @xmath36 , and listing the data at that @xmath33 radius .",
    "consequently , by using this `` equivalent circular '' galaxy method , we are able to make an accurate comparison with the local sample of postman & lauer ( 1995 ) that was originally analyzed using circular apertures . therefore , for all of the data derived and listed in this paper , we have used the profile data given by the iraf program ellipse and have integrated this profile with circular apertures of radius , @xmath36 , rather than the semi - major axis , @xmath32 .",
    "the total magnitude inside this radius , which defines the growth curve @xmath37 , follows directly from the integrations .",
    "calculation of the petrosian radius @xmath3 at various @xmath33 radii follows from the equivalent definition of @xmath3 of djorgovski & spinrad ( 1981 ) , where @xmath3 is the difference in magnitudes between the surface brightness averaged over a radius @xmath12 to the surface brightness ( i.e.  the profile intensity ) at that radius @xmath12 ( see also sandage & perelmuter 1990 for a different derivation of this equivalent definition ) .",
    "we illustrate the calculations using the hst data for three sample galaxies , one from each cluster studied here .",
    "figure 1 shows the hst image of galaxy hst # 40 in cl 1324 + 3011 .",
    "this is the ninth - ranked galaxy in the list of 13 galaxies for this cluster ( see table 5 ) .",
    "its total magnitude , derived from the asymptote of the growth curve and using equation ( 2 ) , is @xmath38 .",
    "its half - light radius is @xmath39 .",
    "( note that the half - light radius for galaxies with normal intensity profiles occurs near @xmath40 mag ; see sandage & perelmuter 1990 ) .",
    "the hst photometric data for this galaxy in the @xmath21 photometric system are listed in table 1 .",
    "column 1 gives the log of the @xmath33 radius .",
    "column 2 lists the @xmath21 surface brightness and the rms error ( in magnitudes ) of the profile at that radius , as determined by the iraf program ellipse .",
    "column 3 gives the total magnitude ( and error ) within a circular aperture of radius @xmath33 .",
    "this quantity was calculated by integrating the profile data in column 2 within the `` effective '' circular aperture of radius @xmath33 listed in column 1 .",
    "these data define the growth curve , @xmath37 .",
    "column 4 lists the mean surface brightness , @xmath41 , averaged over the circular aperture with radius @xmath33 .",
    "it is calculated by adding @xmath42 to the magnitude in column 3 .",
    "column 5 lists the petrosian @xmath3 value ( and error ) calculated by subtracting column 4 from column 2 .",
    "column 6 lists the ellipticity , defined as @xmath43 , of the best - fitting ellipse at the listed radius , as determined using the iraf program ellipse .",
    "figure 2 shows the four diagnostic curves for hst # 40 in cl 1324 + 3011 , based on the data given in table 1 .",
    "the format of these diagrams is the same as figures 8 and 9 of paper ii .",
    "three of the panels show mean surface brightness @xmath9 , apparent magnitude @xmath11 , and petrosian radius @xmath3 versus the `` effective '' circular radius , @xmath33 ( in arcsec ) .",
    "the lower right panel shows @xmath9 versus @xmath3 .",
    "figure 3 shows the image of galaxy hst # 13 in cl 1604 + 4304 .",
    "this is the third - ranked galaxy of the seven galaxies listed for this cluster in table 6 .",
    "its total magnitude , derived from the asymptote of the growth curve and using equation ( 2 ) , is @xmath44 .",
    "its half - light radius is 0 .",
    "table 2 lists the same data as table 1 but for hst # 13 in cl 1604 + 4304 .",
    "again , the listings are given in the hst @xmath21 photometric system .",
    "figure 4 shows the resulting four diagnostic diagrams .",
    "figure 5 shows the image of galaxy hst # 29 in cl 1604 + 4321 .",
    "this is the second - ranked galaxy of the 14 galaxies listed for this cluster in table 7 .",
    "the hst observations were made in the @xmath22 filter .",
    "the total magnitude from the asymptote of the growth curve , the observed keck color of @xmath45 ( see table 7 ) , and equation ( 1 ) , is @xmath46 . its half - light radius is 0 .",
    "table 3 lists the same basic data as tables 1 and 2 .",
    "figure 6 shows the four diagnostic diagrams , with the photometry given in the @xmath22 bandpass .",
    "these three galaxies are typical of the program galaxies , although they are neither the brightest nor the faintest in each cluster .",
    "the angular radii at @xmath47 mag of the 34 program galaxies range from 0 for the largest to 0 for the smallest .",
    "it was shown in paper ii that galaxies with half - light radii of 0 should be free from systematic errors larger than @xmath48 mag due to the finite point spread function of wfpc2 for all @xmath49 .",
    "hence , the data presented here for @xmath50 mag and larger should be free of systematic errors due to the finite resolution of hst . for @xmath51 mag , the data on the smallest galaxies will not be free from some systematic error .",
    "we test this prediction in paper iv where the systematics of the analysis are given for different @xmath3 values .",
    "all 34 galaxies in the three high - redshift clusters were analyzed in the same ways illustrated in tables 13 and figures 2 , 4 , & 6 .",
    "the data measured at each designated @xmath3 value for each galaxy in our sample , obtained by a linear interpolation in similar diagrams for each galaxy , are listed in tables 57 ( see  4 ) .",
    "in order to make a comparison with observations of local objects at zero redshift , the @xmath5 term is a technical correction that must be applied to any observed finite - bandwidth photometry for objects whose spectrum is redshifted ( humason , mayall & sandage 1956 ; oke & sandage 1968 ; sandage 1995 ) .",
    "as defined by these authors , the @xmath5 term corrects the observed intensity to what would have been observed in the rest frame of the particular photometric band defined by a given filter with its color equation .",
    "the observations by opl with the keck telescopes were made with a set of filters whose transmission functions are close to those of the johnson / cousins standard @xmath8 system ( see figure 1 of opl ) .",
    "the filters , of course , sample the near ultraviolet spectra of the highly redshifted cluster galaxies studied here .",
    "for example , the @xmath7 and @xmath6 filters with mean wavelengths of 6000  and 8000 , respectively , sample the rest - frame spectral energy distributions at the mean rest wavelengths of 3158  and 4211 , respectively , for a galaxy at @xmath1 .    to determine what the observed intensities would have been if the redshifted galaxies had been observed at the rest - frame wavelengths of the cape / cousins @xmath16 system , we must know the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the redshifted galaxy in order to tie the observed data at the near - uv and @xmath52 rest wavelengths to the standard @xmath7 and @xmath6 rest wavelengths .",
    "therefore , to calculate the @xmath5 correction for a given galaxy at redshift of e.g.  @xmath1 , we need the true sed of that galaxy over the rest wavelength range from 3000  to the limit of the transmission function of the @xmath6 filter near 11000  ( figure 1 of opl ) .",
    "the @xmath5 corrections that have been tabulated in most of the early literature ( e.g.  oke & sandage 1968 ; whitford 1971 ; yoshii & takahara 1988 ; coleman , wu & weedman 1988 ) used seds that were either observed for local , low - redshift galaxies over a large wavelength range or were calculated using stellar population synthesis programs in the no - evolution case . for early - type ( elliptical and s0 ) galaxies , the observed seds of elliptical galaxies , such as ngc 4486 or ngc 4472 , and/or the central bulge of sb galaxies , such as m31 , were used .",
    "these spectra then were redshifted through the filter curves to calculate @xmath53 .    however , it became clear from the color indices measured by opl and analyzed by plo98 and plo01 that the observed colors of the high - redshift galaxies used here could not be explained with no - evolution seds ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "therefore , to calculate valid @xmath5 corrections for the galaxies in the three high - redshift clusters , we require knowledge of their actual seds , taking into account a luminosity evolution that is a function of wavelength ( see figures 10 & 11 of plo98 ) .    we have obtained the actual seds through work originally performed by postman , lubin & oke to examine the star - formation histories and the ages of the cluster members ( plo98 ; plo01 ) .",
    "these authors compared the observed broad - band ( @xmath8 ) ab magnitudes of each galaxy with a measured redshift to synthetic seds calculated from the 1996 stellar evolution code of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) under a variety of the star - formation scenarios . specifically , they used solar metallicity ( @xmath54 ) models where the star - formation rate falls exponentially with time .",
    "these models are referred to as tau ( @xmath55 ) models .",
    "a best - fit , zero - redshift sed was calculated for each galaxy using its broad - band ab magnitudes which were blueshifted to the appropriate rest wavelengths by a factor of @xmath56 in @xmath57 ( see plo98 and plo01 for details of the fitting procedure ) .    we note that , over the observed passbands , the final best - fit spectrum is nearly independent of the particular @xmath55 model .",
    "the largest differences arise at rest uv wavelengths of @xmath58  which are most sensitive to the youngest stars .",
    "this result is illustrated in figure 7 where we show the best - fit spectrum from a @xmath59 gyr model ( solid line ) and a @xmath60 gyr model ( dotted line ) to the observed ab magnitudes of galaxy hst # 11 in cl 1324 + 3011 .",
    "the redshift of this galaxy is @xmath61 ( plo01 ) .",
    "the difference in the @xmath5 correction measured from the two best - fit synthetic seds would be only @xmath62 mag , depending on the particular passband .",
    "consequently , we have adopted for this paper the results from the @xmath59 gyr model of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) .",
    "once an individual sed was adopted for each galaxy , it was used to calculate an individual @xmath5 correction at the mean redshift of the cluster .",
    "this was done by redshifting the adopted rest - wavelength synthetic sed by @xmath56 and calculating the intensity ratio of the redshifted sed to the non - redshifted sed after convolving each with the appropriate filter function from figure 1 of opl . because the effective bandwidth of the shifted sed is smaller than that for the unshifted spectrum by @xmath63 , the non - selective bandwidth factor of @xmath64 mag",
    "must be added to this intensity ratio ( expressed in magnitudes ) .",
    "[ what we have just described is the explanation of equation ( b7 ) in appendix b of humason , mayall & sandage ( 1956 ) , where the theory of the @xmath5 correction is given in detail . ]",
    "we have calculated individual @xmath18 and @xmath17 values for each of the early - type galaxies in the three clusters by using the best - fit synthetic bruzual & charlot sed based on the individual , observed ab magnitudes .",
    "the corrections are not all identical in a given cluster because of variations in the measured magnitudes at different wavelengths which are caused by a combination of measuring errors due to photon statistics and real differences in the intrinsic seds .",
    "therefore , we have averaged the individual @xmath5 corrections for each cluster and have adopted the mean values listed in table 4 . the rms variation in the individual @xmath5 terms , listed as @xmath65 in table 4 , are small at @xmath66 .",
    "we have measured the total magnitude @xmath11 , mean surface brightness @xmath9 , and angular radius @xmath12 at each of the five @xmath3 values for each galaxy in our sample .",
    "these data were derived from the hst profile data in the way described in  2 . however , in order to remove some of the stochastic nature of the curves ( see e.g.figures 2 , 4 & 6 ) , the measured @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath37 , and @xmath69 functions of each galaxy were smoothed with a three - point boxcar filter .",
    "the smoothed curves permitted the growth curve @xmath14 , the mean surface brightness @xmath70 , and the angular radii @xmath15 functions to be interpolated analytically at the discrete values of @xmath71 .",
    "these values , corrected by the adopted mean @xmath5 terms in table 4 , are given in tables 57 .",
    "we have estimated the error on the total magnitude by adding in quadrature the uncertainties associated with the measured @xmath5 correction ( including both the rms error on the mean value and the uncertainty in the choice of bruzual & charlot model ; see  3 ) and our `` effective circular '' galaxy approximation ( see  4.2 of paper ii ) .",
    "these errors also apply to the measurements of mean surface brightness @xmath9 .        which is the definition of mean surface brightness .",
    "this equation was used , as described in  2.2 , to calculate @xmath41 from the total magnitude , @xmath11 , and `` effective '' circular radius , @xmath33 , using data tables similar to tables 13 . however , the entries in tables 57 are obtained by interpolating the smoothed curves of the @xmath9 , @xmath11 , and log @xmath33 as a function of @xmath3 for each of the program galaxies . in the majority of cases , the listed log @xmath33 values in tables",
    "57 are within less than 0.01 dex of the requirement of equation ( 3 ) . where there are differences , they are due to the effects of the smoothing of the observed @xmath73 and @xmath15 functions which produce small deviations among the measured quantities .",
    "deviations in the log of the linear radius r ( used in paper iv ) at the level of 0.007 dex , which is the rms value for the mean deviations from equation ( 3 ) of all listed angular radii in tables 57 , are totally negligible for the analysis .    the data in tables 57 are the source in the search for a tolman signal in paper iv .",
    "it is to be emphasized again that the data are independent of any assumptions about cosmological parameters .",
    "they are directly observed from the profile data .",
    "the @xmath3 values are metric radii defined by the ratio of surface brightnesses that are measured directly over the face of the galaxy , with no assumption as to any value of a _ linear _ radius .",
    "the apparent magnitudes within the designated @xmath3 radius requires only a summing of intensities in the pixels interior to that radius .    on the other hand , use of these data for the tolman test by comparing the @xmath9 values in tables 57 with those of the local galaxies in paper",
    "i requires knowledge of the _ absolute _ magnitudes , @xmath10 , and _ linear _ radii , r. these quantities are needed to produce the diagnostic diagrams of paper i. the calculations of @xmath10 and r do require knowledge of the deceleration parameter , @xmath19 , that appears in the mattig ( 1958 ) equations . although the analysis for the tolman test is slightly degenerate because of this requirement , we have shown in  5 of paper i that the resulting hermeneutical circularity is sufficiently small .",
    "we shall show this again in paper iv by comparing the tolman signals for different assumed @xmath19 values .",
