    "for most applications of general relativity light rays can be considered as lightlike geodesics of the spacetime metric , i.e. , the influence of a medium on the light rays can be neglected . however , in the radio frequency range this is not always true .",
    "a well - known example is the influence of the solar corona on the travel time and on the deflection angle of radio signals that come close to the sun .",
    "this influence is routinely observed since the 1960s . in this case",
    "one may assume that the medium is a non - magnetized pressureless plasma and for the gravitational field the linearized theory is sufficient .",
    "the relevant equations have been determined by muhleman et al .",
    "gravitational lensing in this approximation was firstly discussed by bliokh and minakov @xcite . in these works",
    "both the gravitational and the plasma deflection are assumed to be small and they are calculated separately from each other .",
    "there is good reason to assume that also black holes and other compact objects are surrounded by a plasma and it is an interesting question to investigate if the plasma could have an observable effect on radio signals that come close to such a compact object . in such cases",
    "the linearized theory is not sufficient . for a spherically symmetric uncharged black hole ,",
    "one has to consider the schwarzschild metric and for a rotating uncharged black hole one has to consider the kerr metric .",
    "some results on light propagation in a non - magnetized pressureless plasma on the schwarzschild or kerr spacetime are known .",
    "the influence of a spherically symmetric and time - independent plasma density on the light deflection in the schwarzschild spacetime was calculated and discussed by perlick @xcite . in this study neither the gravitational nor the plasma deflection",
    "is assumed to be small .",
    "later , the influence of plasma effects on gravitational lensing was investigated , with different methods , by bisnovatyi - kogan and tsupko @xcite . in the kerr spacetime ,",
    "light deflection in the equatorial plane was calculated by perlick @xcite for the case of a rotationally symmetric and time - independent plasma density . within the approximation of small deflection , lensing of light rays off the equatorial plane",
    "was considered by morozova et al .",
    "@xcite who assumed a slowly rotating kerr black hole .",
    "the influence of a plasma on the multiple imaging properties in the strong - bending regime was investigated by bisnovatyi - kogan and tsupko @xcite for the schwarzschild spacetime and recently extended to kerr spacetime by liu , ding and jing @xcite .",
    "for some possible astrophysical observations of plasma effects near compact objects we refer to rogers @xcite and for plasma effects in strong lens system to er and mao @xcite . for",
    "a review see @xcite .    here",
    "we want to concentrate on the influence of a plasma on the shadow of a black hole . roughly speaking",
    ", the shadow is the black disk an observer sees in the sky if a black hole is viewed against a backdrop of light sources that are distributed around the black hole but not between the observer and the black hole . for constructing the shadow we have to consider all past - oriented light rays that issue from a chosen observer position .",
    "each of these light rays corresponds to a point on the observer s sky .",
    "we assign darkness to a point if the corresponding light ray goes to the horizon of the black hole and brightness otherwise . without a plasma ,",
    "the shadow of a schwarzschild black hole was calculated by synge @xcite and the shape of the shadow of a kerr black hole , for an observer at infinity , was calculated by bardeen @xcite . in an earlier paper @xcite we have generalized synge s formula to the case of a spherically symmetric and static plasma distribution on a spherically symmetric and static spacetime .",
    "as particular examples , we have worked out the results for the case that the underlying spacetime geometry is ( a ) that of a schwarzschild black hole and ( b ) that of an ellis wormhole . in the present paper we want to derive a similar result for a plasma around a kerr black hole .",
    "more precisely , it is our goal to derive an analytical formula for the boundary curve of the shadow on the sky of an observer at an arbitrary position outside of the horizon of the black hole ( i.e. , in contrast to bardeen we do not consider an observer at infinity ) . without the influence of a plasma ,",
    "such a formula has been derived by grenzebach et al .",
    "@xcite for the case of a black hole of the plebaski - demiaski class ( which includes the kerr black hole as a special case ) .",
    "their method made use of the fact that the equation of motion for vacuum light rays admits a fourth constant of motion , the carter constant , in addition to the ones that follow from the symmetry .",
    "therefore , an important first step in our analysis will be to find out under what conditions a carter constant exists for light propagation in a plasma on a kerr spacetime .",
    "of course , this result is of interest not only for the calculation of the shadow but also for other problems .",
    "the perspectives of actually observing the influence of a plasma on the shadow , e.g. for sgr a@xmath1 or for m87 , have been discussed in our earlier paper @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hamilton ] we review the hamilton formalism for light rays in a non - magnetized , pressureless plasma on a general - relativistic spacetime and we specialize the relevant equations to the kerr metric . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sepcon ] we derive the necessary and sufficient condition on the plasma electron density that guarantees separability of the hamilton - jacobi equation for light rays , i.e. , that guarantees the existence of a carter constant only .",
    "they assume that in this case a carter constant exists . in section [ sec : sepcon ]",
    "we will demonstrate that this is actually not the case : for a kerr black hole with @xmath2 and a non - zero plasma density that depends on @xmath3 only , the hamilton - jacobi equation for the light rays is _ not _ separable , i.e. , there is no carter constant .",
    "therefore , the pictures of the kerr shadow in a plasma produced in ref .",
    "@xcite are , unfortunately , based on incorrect equations . ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : phreg ] we determine the photon region for a plasma density around a kerr black hole that satisfies the separability condition .",
    "the photon region is the spacetime region filled with spherical light rays , i.e. , with light rays that stay on a sphere @xmath0 in boyer - lindquist coordinates .",
    "knowledge on the location of the spherical geodesics and on the constants of motion associated with them is of crucial relevance for deriving the boundary curve of the shadow on the sky of an observer anywhere in the domain of outer communication of the black hole .",
    "this will be done , in close analogy to the procedure in grenzebach et al .",
    "@xcite , in sec .",
    "[ sec : shadow ] . in the rest of the paper",
    "we determine the photon regions and the shadow for some special cases where the separability condition is satisfied .",
    "our conventions are as follows .",
    "we use the summation convention for greek indices that take the values 0,1,2,3 .",
    "our choice of signature is @xmath4 .",
    "we raise and lower greek indices with the spacetime metric .",
    "@xmath5 is the gravitational constant and @xmath6 is the vacuum speed of light .",
    "we use units such that @xmath7 , i.e , energies have the same unit as frequencies and momentum vectors have the same unit as wave vectors .",
    "light propagation in a non - magnetized pressureless plasma can be characterized by the hamiltonian @xmath8 here @xmath9 are the contravariant components of the spacetime metric tensor and @xmath10 is the plasma electron frequency which equals , up to a scalar factor , the electron density , @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the electron charge and mass , respectively , and @xmath14 is the electron number density .",
    "@xmath15 are the spacetime coordinates and @xmath16 are the canonical momentum coordinates .",
    "the light rays are the solutions to hamilton s equations @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a curve parameter which has no direct physical or geometrical meaning .",
    "a rigorous derivation from maxwell s equations of this hamiltonian approach was given , even for the more general case of a magnetized plasma , by breuer and ehlers @xcite .",
    "for the much simpler case of a non - magnetized plasma , a similar derivation can be found in @xcite .    in regions",
    "where @xmath19 we may use the hamiltonian @xmath20 @xmath21 because multiplying a hamiltonian with a nowhere vanishing function does not affect the solution curves to ( [ eq : ham ] ) , except for a reparametrization @xmath22 . using the hamiltonian",
    "@xmath23 demonstrates that the rays are _ timelike _ geodesics of the conformally rescaled metric @xmath24 .",
    "the new curve parameter @xmath25 is proper time with respect to this metric .",
    "although such a conformal rescaling is often convenient , in the following we prefer to work with the hamiltonian @xmath26 , rather than with the hamiltonian @xmath23 , because then the equations can be immediately applied to all regions , independently of whether @xmath19 or @xmath27 .",
    "a plasma is a dispersive medium , i.e. , light propagation depends on the frequency . to assign a frequency to a light ray",
    ", we have to choose an observer with four - velocity @xmath28 , normalized to @xmath29 . decomposing the momentum into a component parallel to @xmath28 and a component orthogonal to @xmath28",
    ", @xmath30 defines the frequency @xmath31 and the spatial wave vector @xmath32 note that @xmath33 is positive if @xmath28 is future - pointing and @xmath34 is past - pointing .",
    "we have chosen this somewhat unusual convention because later , when we calculate the shadow , we will consider light rays issuing from the observer position into the past and we want to assign a positive frequency to those rays .    with the decomposition ( [ eq : pmudec ] ) , the condition @xmath35 may be solved for the frequency which gives the dispersion relation in the familiar form , @xmath36 as @xmath37 is spacelike , this equation implies @xmath38 i.e. , light propagation is possible only with a frequency that is bigger than the plasma frequency .",
    "if we introduce in the usual way the phase velocity @xmath39 and the index of refraction @xmath40 we see that the index of refraction , as a function of @xmath41 and @xmath33 , is of the same form for all @xmath28 , @xmath42 the remarkable fact is that the index of refraction depends only on the function @xmath10 , i.e. , on the plasma electron density , but not on the four - velocity field of the plasma .",
    "this demonstrates that a non - magnetized pressureless plasma is an example for the type of dispersive medium that was discussed in detail in the text - book by synge @xcite , chapter xi .",
    "condition ( [ eq : omegacon ] ) guarantees that the index of refraction is real ( and non - negative ) for all allowed frequencies",

    "we restrict our consideration to the domain of outer communication , i.e. , to the domain outside of the outer horizon , @xmath52 .    with the metric coefficients specified to the kerr metric , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hg ] ) reads @xmath53 @xmath54 we assume that @xmath10 is a function only of @xmath3 and @xmath55",
    ". then @xmath56 and @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath58 and @xmath59 are constants of motion .",
    "@xmath59 is the @xmath60 component of the angular momentum .",
    "if we write @xmath61 the physical meaning of the constant of motion @xmath62 becomes clear if we specify the frequency ( [ eq : freq ] ) to the case of an observer on a @xmath63 line , @xmath64 , @xmath65 which is possible everywhere outside the ergoregion where @xmath66 .",

    "this method of plotting the shadow , which was also used in @xcite , is to be distinguished from the one introduced by bardeen @xcite .",
    "firstly , bardeen considers an observer at infinity while we allow any observer position in the domain of outer communication .",
    "secondly , bardeen plots the shadow on a plane where ( dimensionful ) impact parameters are used as the coordinates on the axes , while our ( dimensionless ) coordinates are directly related to angular measures on the observer s sky .",
    "thirdly , the origin of bardeen s coordinates corresponds to a null ray with @xmath179 while our origin corresponds to a principal null ray which has @xmath180 ; of course , the choice of the origin is a matter of convention .",
    "one just has to keep in mind that our way of plotting may be directly compared with bardeen s only if the observer is at a big radius coordinate and that the origin is horizontally shifted .    for the construction of the shadow we prescribe the constant of motion @xmath181 .",
    "there are two different situations that may be considered .",
    "( a ) firstly , we may think of static light sources distributed at big radius coordinates that emit light rays monochromatically with this frequency @xmath62 .",
    "note that these light rays arrive at the observer , whose four - velocity @xmath182 is given by ( [ eq : tetrad ] ) , with different frequencies , i.e. , in general this observer will see the shadow against a backdrop that is not monochromatic . this is true also for the shadow without a plasma .",
    "only if the observer is static and far away from the black hole will the backdrop be monochromatic but , for any position of the observer , we may directly use our formula for the boundary curve of the shadow with the prescribed @xmath62 .",
    "( b ) secondly , we may think of light sources that emit a wide range of frequencies , and of an observer that filters out a particular frequency @xmath183 .",
    "then we have to express @xmath62 in our equations for the shadow in terms of @xmath183 .",
    "the desired relation between the two frequencies follows from ( [ eq : freq ] ) with @xmath184 if @xmath185 is inserted from ( [ eq : tetrad ] ) .",
    "we find that @xmath186 after solving this equation for @xmath62 , we are able to replace @xmath62 in ( [ eq : shtheta ] ) and ( [ eq : shpsi ] ) by @xmath183 .",
    "the same substitution has to be made in ( [ eq : pphispher ] ) and ( [ eq : kspher ] ) with @xmath187 ; inserting the latter expressions into ( [ eq : shtheta ] ) and ( [ eq : shpsi ] ) gives the boundary curve of the shadow parametrized by @xmath159 , now for prescribed @xmath183 .",
    "the range of the curve parameter @xmath159 has to be determined for each value of @xmath183 individually .",
    "note that , by ( [ eq : omegaobs ] ) , @xmath188 for @xmath189 , i.e. , that there is no difference between case ( a ) and case ( b ) if the observer is at a big radius coordinate .    for the reader",
    "s convenience , we end this section by summarizing the construction method of the shadow in a step - by - step procedure .",
    "choose the mass parameter @xmath46 and the spin parameter @xmath47 with @xmath51 .",
    "the mass parameter @xmath46 gives a natural length unit , i.e. , all other lengths may be given in units of @xmath46 .",
    "choose a plasma frequency @xmath190 around the black hole which is related to the electron number density by the formula ( [ eq : omega_p ] ) .",
    "the plasma frequency has to satisfy the separability condition ( [ eq : sepcon ] ) , so the plasma distribution is characterized by two functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",

    "choose a position of an observer anywhere in the domain of outer communication by prescribing its radial and angular coordinate @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "for an illustration see fig . 7 in @xcite .",
    "choose the constant of motion @xmath181 for the rays that are to be considered .",
