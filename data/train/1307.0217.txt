    "<S> we show that the feature of klein tunneling makes graphene a unique interface for implementing low control quantum gates between static and mobile qubits . </S>",
    "<S> a ballistic electron spin is considered as the mobile qubit , while the static qubit is the electronic spin of a quantum dot fixed in a graphene nanoribbon . </S>",
    "<S> scattering is the low control mechanism of the gate , which , in other systems , is really difficult to exploit because of both back - scattering and the momentum dependence of scattering . </S>",
    "<S> we find that klein tunneling enables the implementation of quasi - deterministic quantum gates regardless of the momenta or the shape of the wave function of the incident electron . </S>",
    "<S> the dirac equation is used to describe the system in the one particle approximation with the interaction between the static and the mobile spins modelled by a heisenberg hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we discuss an application of this model to generate entanglement between two well separated static qubits .    </S>",
    "<S> interfacing static and mobile qubits is one of the central tasks in the emerging area of quantum technology , as it may aid in linking separated quantum registers . as in any other quantum information processing ( qip ) task </S>",
    "<S> , it has to deal with the twin challenges of decoherence and demanding control . </S>",
    "<S> the latter challenge can be somewhat alleviated in a scenario which uses the scattering of one flying qubit with a static qubit to accomplish an useful qip scheme . in this way </S>",
    "<S> we just have to set the initial configuration , inject the flying qubit and measure the final state . in a solid state scenario , the experimental development of the new field called quantum electron optics @xcite </S>",
    "<S> allows the possibility to manipulate the path of just one electron in a ballistic regime . </S>",
    "<S> thus the flying qubit can be implemented with a ballistic electron spin . </S>",
    "<S> the static qubit can be created with the spin of a quantum dot ( qd ) or a magnetic impurity , embedded on a quantum wire , which can be implemented with quantum hall edge states @xcite , with carbon nanotubes @xcite or a graphene nanoribbon @xcite ( we adopt this last realization in this paper ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus all basic ingredients for interfacing static and mobile spins through scattering already exist , even though they have not been put together in one setup .    </S>",
    "<S> however , as soon as one starts to consider scattering as a low control mechanism for interfacing static and mobile qubits , a number of obstacles seem to present . </S>",
    "<S> the most obvious is the spatial scattering in unwanted directions when the spins interact so that it is difficult to maintain the directionality of the mobile qubit . </S>",
    "<S> this is important if the mobile qubit has to interact with another static qubit in series and thereby connect two quantum registers . despite this , a number of useful qip applications of the scattering of a static and a mobile qubit have been presented @xcite using techniques such as the post - selection of events were the mobile spin was spatially scattered in a given direction . essentially this makes the protocols non - deterministic . </S>",
    "<S> the most useful task , namely accomplishing a unitary quantum gate between the static and the mobile spin through scattering is very challenging , requiring additional mirrors and/or potential barriers for the mobile particle , as well as a careful placement of these elements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> central to most schemes is the necessity to engineer the incident states of the mobile spins to a very narrow wavepacket in momentum space ( nearly monochormatic electrons ) . </S>",
    "<S> arbitrary wavepackets of the mobile spins would be a significant hindrance to such protocols . in this paper , we show that graphene is a unique host material that can help to overcome the problems of both back - scattering and the momentum dependence of scattering while interfacing a static and a mobile spin qubit . in particular , we find that a graphene nano - ribbon can enable quasi - deterministic quantum gates between a ballistic electron spin and a quantum dot spin in which one does not need to finely control the incident wavepacket of the ballistic electron . </S>",
    "<S> while a graphene nano - ribbon is already appreciated as an ideal material for quantum spintronics by minimizing the decoherence problem @xcite , our work indicates that it would also be act as an ideal interfacing element between a static and a mobile qubit .    </S>",
    "<S> graphene is a monolayer of carbon atoms packed into a hexagonal crystal structure with extraordinary electronic properties @xcite and presents a high spin coherence time . </S>",
    "<S> the last is due to the low spin - orbit coupling in a carbon - based materials , and because natural carbon consists predominantly of zero - spin isotope @xmath0c , for which the hyperfine interaction is absent @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all this makes graphene a very interesting option to implement spintronic systems . </S>",
    "<S> the main feature of the electronic properties in graphene is the linear dependence between energy and momentum of @xmath1 electrons at low energies , making a difference with the usual quadratic energy - momentum dispersion relation in ordinary materials . </S>",
    "<S> this peculiar relation causes the electron transport in graphene to be governed by the dirac - like hamiltonian @xcite , and electrons behave like massless dirac fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the relativistic analogy extends to the electron wavefunction in graphene , which is a two - component vector discriminating between the contribution of the two triangular sublattices , constituting the hexagonal graphene lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this degree of freedom is known as _ pseudospin _ and its states have a well defined chiriality : the pseudospin is parallel ( antiparallel ) to the electron ( hole ) momentum @xcite . to perform a pseudospin flip process </S>",
    "<S> , an electron must interact with a short range potential acting differently on the two sublattices . in the rest </S>",
    "<S> we consider that the pseudospin is conserved . </S>",
    "<S> then , if a ballistic graphene electron is scattered by a potential barrier in one direction , a hole state moving in the opposite direction is created inside the potential , to preserve the pseudospin direction . </S>",
    "<S> this allows a perfect electronic transmission through a potential barrier by means of a hole state , analogically to a relativistic transport phenomena known as klein tunnelling @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> although the presence of klein tunnelling increases coherence in the ballistic electrons , it also represents a limitation to create quantum confinement . </S>",
    "<S> the use of graphene nanoribbons with semiconducting armchair boundaries solves this problem ; the transversal direction confinement in a nanoribbon with this conditions creates a gap between conduction and valence band @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this energy gap can be use to localize electrons in a small region through electric gating @xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a graphene nanoribbon of width @xmath2 and with semiconducting armchair boundaries in the @xmath3 axis ( see fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the transversal confinement produces a quantization of the transverse wavevector @xmath4 , which can be expressed as @xcite    @xmath5    the band gap is @xmath6 , with @xmath7 the graphene fermi velocity ( @xmath8 m s@xmath9 @xcite ) , which can be used to make a one - electron qd with a square potential well @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that the qd has rectangular shape , with the same width as the graphene nanoribbon and with a length @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> then , a ballistic electron moving along on the graphene nanoribbon is scattered by the qd , with incident angle @xmath11 and energy @xmath12 , as is shown in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> the transversal confinement is a constraint to the incident angle @xmath11 , as the quantization of @xmath4 limits the accessible wave vectors with a fixed energy @xmath12 as    @xmath13.\\ ] ]    the problem can be overcome tuning the ballistic electron energy @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the frontal scattering ( @xmath14 ) is asymptotically obtained when @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a constraint in the use of klein tunnelling in semiconducting armchair graphene nanoribbons , as the total transmission is only present in frontal scattering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , in the next we will show how variations in the incident angle produce only small changes in the transmission rates .    </S>",
    "<S> consider that the ballistic electron energy @xmath12 and @xmath10 are such that we can assume @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the ballistic electron de broglie wavelength , in order to avoid resonant behaviours . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption allows us to describe the ballistic electron and qd interaction as a delta potential . </S>",
    "<S> for example , with a ballistic electron energy @xmath18 mev , the fermi wavelength is @xmath19 nm , then @xmath10 could be @xmath20 nm . </S>",
    "<S> although the coulomb interaction between the qd and the incident electron is considered as long range , this range can be controlled with the addition of a metallic substrate , which screen the qd charge @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , the system can be depicted with a one - particle dirac - like hamiltonian    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the pauli matrices vector , and the qd is located at @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> note that here we have assumed that the scattering process is elastic , then the wavevector of the incoming and the outcoming electron are the same . </S>",
    "<S> this is indeed well within the parameter scale of our problem as theoretical studies have estimated the inelastic length and time scales for hot ballistic electrons in graphene to be @xmath24 nm and @xmath25ps respectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the elasticity also guarantees that the configuration  one electron confined to the dot , and one electron moving , remains fixed even after the scattering . treating the quantum dot spin in a manner similar to an anderson impurity , the effective heisenberg term @xmath26 in eq.([hgra ] ) </S>",
    "<S> can be found out to reduce the two electron problem to a one electron problem . </S>",
    "<S> note that because of the delta function , the units of @xmath27 is ev , rather than just ev .    </S>",
    "<S> [ figura2 ]    the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( eq .  [ hgra ] ) must include the pseudospin , electron and qd spins contributions . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the qd as a static @xmath28 - spin particle , with the wavefunction    @xmath29    in terms of the pauli vectors @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the electron wavefunction in a graphene nanoribbon can be modelled as a two - dimensional monochromatic wave moving with a wavevector @xmath31 with @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> then the ballistic electron wavefunction in the region @xmath33 is a four - component vector ( two from the pseudospin and two from the spin ) of the form    @xmath34    the first term in the right side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ wfe1 ] represents the incident electron while the second term describes the reflected electron with a probability amplitude @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the transmitted electron wavefunction has the form    @xmath36    for @xmath37 with a transmission probability amplitude @xmath38 . here , @xmath39 </S>",
    "<S> = sgn@xmath40 generalizes the wavefunction for the case of a hole , considered as a negative - energy particle . </S>",
    "<S> the incident angle @xmath41 is measured from the @xmath42 axis , and it also depicts the pseudospin direction . in the one - particle approximation </S>",
    "<S> the entire system wavefunction can be written as @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath44 is a eight - dimension vector with twelve probability amplitudes in the two regions ( @xmath33 and @xmath37 ) . </S>",
    "<S> similarly to the well known nonrelativistic delta barrier problem , to find the boundary conditions we have to integrate the eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ hgra ] on an infinitesimally small interval around @xmath23 as    @xmath45    a special problem for this limit evaluation is that in a dirac - like hamiltonian the inclusion of a delta potential produces a discontinuity in the wavefunction . </S>",
    "<S> we will use the approach of @xcite to solve this problem , and we allow the components of @xmath46 to have a finite discontinuity at @xmath23 and extend the definition of delta function by writing    @xmath47    after applying eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ delta ] in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ bo1 ] , we arrive to the boundary condition    @xmath48 +   \\\\ & & \\frac{j}{2}\\hat{\\mbox{\\boldmath$s$}}_e\\cdot\\hat{\\mbox{\\boldmath$s$}}_i[\\psi(0_+,y)-\\psi(0_-,y)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    assuming we know the initial spinor state of the electron and quantum dot , we can solve the 12-variable equation system with the initial conditions and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ bo2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> now we focus on the probability amplitude of the scattered wavefunction if a spin flip takes place ( @xmath49 ) , or if it does not ( @xmath50 ) , which are    @xmath51    and    @xmath52    we now pause breifly to state the non - trivial conditions needed for a unitary quantum gate between a static and a scattered qubit dependent on the latter s transmission @xcite . usually , only the whole scattering process is unitary in the space and spin combined degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> if spin - flipped and no spin - flipped states of the mobile spin have different probablities for transmission , then , by measuring the transmission , some information about the spin state can be acquired . </S>",
    "<S> this transformation is then clearly not unitary in the spin degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the general transformation acting on the spin density matrix @xmath53 of the two qubits on transmission of the mobile spin is @xmath54},\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the probability amplitude matrix acting in a nonlinear way on @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the condition needed to assure unitarity and linearity of @xmath55 is @xmath56 , with @xmath49 and @xmath50 the probability amplitudes of do or do not have a spin flip of both spins after scattering , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this is the condition to implement an electron scattering quantum gate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> not only is it very intricate to satify @xmath56 for particles with schroedinger dispersion , the total transmission @xmath57 in such cases is significantly lower than unity for really useful two qubit gates , making the gates non - deterministic @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> now notice from eqs.([tn ] ) and ( [ ts ] ) that the klein tunnelling ( @xmath58 ) is present , and the gate condition @xmath59 is fulfilled independently of @xmath27 when @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the gates implemented will be deterministic . the cause of this behaviour can be seen clearly if we express the system spinor in terms of the singlet - triplets basis ( @xmath61 ) , which are eigenfunctions of the heisenberg operator , then the dynamics of the singlet and triplet subspaces are decoupled . </S>",
    "<S> in each of these subspaces , the heisenberg interaction term of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ hgra ] reduces to a spinless potential barrier @xcite so the effective hamiltonian describes a particle scattering from two spin - independent potentials as    @xmath62    where    @xmath63\\,\\,\\ ] ]    is an effective potential and @xmath64 is the quantum number associated with @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) in the case of the singlet ( triplet ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ballistic electron , as a massless pseudo dirac fermion , can be perfectly transmitted through these potentials due to the klein tunnelling @xcite , and we expect that @xmath68 for any value of @xmath27 . in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tn ] and [ ts ] we can see that the angular dependence of the probability amplitudes in frontal insertion is resilient to small angular changes . also , in frontal scattering the klein tunnelling is independent of @xmath69 , and then it is present when the ballistic electron is in a wavepacket form . in fig .  2 a ) we show the evolution of the probabilities of detecting a transmitted electron , i.e.  the success probability of the gate , @xmath70 as a function of the incident angle @xmath11 , and the coupling factor @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the values for the success of the gate change only approximately 5 % when @xmath11 changes from @xmath71 to @xmath72 , and remains almost constant as @xmath27 evolves .    </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the heisenberg spins interaction is described by the coupling factor @xmath73 , which contains all the information about the shape of the quantum dot through the overlap integral    @xmath74    and the coulombic repulsion between electrons    @xmath75    where @xmath76 nm is the radial extent of a @xmath77-orbital in graphene @xcite , and @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the ballistic electron and qd wavefunctions , respectively . here , the exchange interaction between qd and ballistic electron depends on the parameters @xmath80 , @xmath10 and the qd and ballistic electron energies , which can be controlled to reach a desired @xmath27 value .    </S>",
    "<S> [ figura3 ]    we show @xmath81 as a function of variations in @xmath11 and @xmath27 in the fig .  2 b ) , whenever @xmath82 the gate condition is fulfilled . </S>",
    "<S> notice that this is satisfied in @xmath83 ev , independently of the angle of incidence . </S>",
    "<S> the gates implemented here will be of the @xmath84 type and , with the exception of the one at @xmath60 , they will be nondeterministic .    </S>",
    "<S> [ figura4 ]    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 we show the transmitivitty or probability of the occurence of no spin flip ( @xmath85 blue line ) and of a spin flip ( @xmath86 red line ) after a frontal scattering , as a function of the coupling factor @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> notice there are two values of @xmath27 ( namely , @xmath87 ev  and @xmath88 ev ) for which @xmath89 . at those points </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the implemented gate will be a @xmath90 , which generates maximum entanglement between the electron and qd spins . </S>",
    "<S> we see also a perfect spin flip point ( @xmath91 ev ) , and the implemented gate will be a @xmath84 </S>",
    "<S> . the implementation of this kind of gates can be useful to initialize and to read out the qd spin state injecting a polarized ballistic electron whose final state can be measured directly .    a possible application of the previous model is to use the ballistic electron spin as a mediator to correlate two fixed and distant qd . </S>",
    "<S> the separation between the two qd can be in the @xmath24 nm range because essentially there is no inelastic scattering over this range @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> now suppose that we control the initial spin conditions and the values of @xmath27 in each qd . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , we can set the probability amplitudes of the electron frontal scattering with the first qd to be @xmath92 and @xmath93 , and also we can set the probability amplitudes of the electron frontal scattering with the second qd to be @xmath94 and @xmath95 . if we inject a ballistic electron with a known spin state , for instance @xmath96 , the transformation can be represented in the computation basis of the two qds spins ( @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 ) as    @xmath101    the triangular form of this matrix is due to the total transmission in the scattering events , making that the result on the second qd has no effect on the first one and no resonant behaviour is expected . if we set the @xmath27 factor of the second qd to be swap - like , which means @xmath102 and @xmath103 , it is straightforward to see that after the electron frontal scattering with both qds , we will obtain a superposition in the qds spin states of the form @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , with this process we can control the level of entanglement generated after the scattering . </S>",
    "<S> if we choose the @xmath27 coefficient of the first qd to generate a @xmath90 gate , which this time means @xmath105 and @xmath106 , we can assure a total entangled final state between qd spins . </S>",
    "<S> it is not necessary to perform a postselection of any kind on the electron after the frontal scattering .    before concluding , </S>",
    "<S> let us point out that one could possibly choose different parameter regimes to obtain the values of @xmath27 required above for the @xmath90 and @xmath84 , which are really the useful for qip . </S>",
    "<S> however , for a parameter regime that we could readily identify , namely , @xmath107 , @xmath18 mev , @xmath108 nm , one obtains an angle of incidence @xmath109 degrees ( @xmath110% reflection occurs at 20 degrees ) , @xmath111 mev , @xmath112 mev , and thereby @xmath113ev . for this value </S>",
    "<S> the spin - flip probability on transmission is @xmath114 , and thereby the entangled state of the impurity 1 and the ballistic spin that is generated is @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> this is still an entangled state , and the fact that this is a result of a unitary operation makes the gate an entangling gate  which is still very useful for qip , though not as readily useful as the maximally entangling @xmath90 gate . </S>",
    "<S> for example , taking the scenario of two static quantum dot based spins @xmath116 and @xmath117 mentioned above , but with the ballistic electron , initially in the @xmath96 state , undergoing the same gate with both spins @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( as opposed to the above case ) in the parameter set of this paragraph , one can create the highly entangled state @xmath118 with a @xmath119 success probability conditional on detecting the ballistic electron in the state @xmath120 ( say , by a spin filter ) .    in summary , in this work </S>",
    "<S> we have shown how the klein tunnelling , present in the graphene electrons scattering off a rectangular qd , is useful to implement a quasi - deterministic two - qubit quantum gate between the ballistic electron spin and the qd spin . </S>",
    "<S> the transversal confinement limits the incident angle in the scattering process , due to the quantization of the transverse wavevector @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this problem can be overcome tuning the ballistic electron energy to reach the frontal scattering ( @xmath60 ) angle asymptotically . </S>",
    "<S> we show that when @xmath83 ev , @xmath85 is equal to zero for any value of the incident angle , and a @xmath84 gate is obtained . in a frontal scattering , </S>",
    "<S> the klein tunnelling is present and we always will find quantum gates . </S>",
    "<S> the gates implemented in these conditions are quasi - deterministic , because the gate success depends on how approximately frontal the scattering is . </S>",
    "<S> however , we see that a change in the incident angle of @xmath72 from the ideal frontal angle produce only small changes ( of about 5 % ) in the gate success probability . it has also been shown how this model can be used to generate and control the entanglement between two fixed and distant magnetic impurities , taking a ballistic electron spin as a mediator . even in a parameter set that we could readily identify , an useful entangling quantum gate is obtained between the static spin and the ballistic electron spin . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps some of this work will be adaptable to a setting of carbon nanotubes , were an absence of back - scattering is also present @xcite . </S>"
