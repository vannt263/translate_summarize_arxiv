    "stable stratification with rotation is an important feature of geophysical flows @xcite .",
    "the strength of stratification is usually measured by the non - dimensional parameter called froude number ( @xmath5 ) , which is defined as the ratio of the time scale of gravity waves and the nonlinear time scale .",
    "strong stratification has @xmath6 , while weak stratification has @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "researchers have studied such flows with all or some of the features . in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to two - dimensional stable stratification @xcite that allows us to explore a wide range of @xmath5 and characterise the interscale transfer of energy and enstrophy , and the energy spectra in strongly , moderately , and weakly stratified scenarios .",
    "apart from a reduction in dimensionality , the 2d stratified system differs from the more traditional three - dimensional ( 3d ) equations in that it lacks a vortical mode .",
    "indeed , the decomposition of the 3d system into vortical and wave modes @xcite has proved useful in studying stratified @xcite and rotating - stratified @xcite turbulence .",
    "the absence of a vortical mode implies that the 2d stratified system only supports nonlinear wave - wave mode interactions @xcite ( interestingly , 3d analogs that only support wave interactions have also been considered previously @xcite ) . in a decaying",
    "setting , the initial value problem concerning the fate of a standing wave in 2d has been studied experimentally @xcite and numerically @xcite .",
    "the regime was that of strong stratification , and not only where the waves observed to break , this process was accompanied by a forward energy transfer due to nonlocal parametric subharmonic instability @xcite .",
    "further , at long times after breaking , the turbulence generated was characterised by a @xmath8 scaling ( i.e. , parallel to the direction of ambient stratification ) @xcite .",
    "other decaying simulations , that focussed on the formation and distortion of fronts from an initially smooth profile , noted a self - similarity in the probability density function of the vorticity field as well as more of an isotropic @xmath9 kinetic energy ( ke ) spectrum , though at early stages in the evolution of the system @xcite .",
    "with respect to the forced problem , the case of random small scale forcing has been well studied .",
    "specifically , at moderate stratification , the 2d system developed a robust vertically sheared horizontal flow ( vshf ; @xcite ) accompanied by an inverse transfer of ke and a @xmath9 scaling @xcite .",
    "for weak stratification , a novel flux loop mechanism involving the upscale transfer of ke ( with @xmath9 scaling ) and the downscale transfer of potential energy ( pe ) , also with @xmath9 scaling , was seen to result in a stationary state @xcite .",
    "in fact , moisture driven strongly stratitifed flows in 2d have also been seen to exhibit a upscale ke transfer with a @xmath9 scaling @xcite .",
    "interestingly , large - scale forcing in the form of a temperature gradient has been examined experimentally . specifically , using a soap film , zhang _",
    "et al . _  @xcite reported scaling of density fluctuations at low frequencies with exponents @xmath10 ( bolgiano scaling  @xcite ) and @xmath11 ( batchelor scaling  @xcite ) for moderate and strong temperature gradients , respectively .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite noted a similar scaling , and the development of isolated coherent vortices on a curved 2d soap bubble .    in the present work we look at the relatively unexamined case of random forcing at large scales .",
    "the flows are simulated using a pseudospectral code tarang  @xcite for @xmath5 ranging from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "for @xmath14 , i.e. , strong stratification , a vshf ( identified as internal gravity waves ) emerges at large scales and co - exists with small scale turbulence .",
    "the turbulent flow is characterized by a forward enstrophy cascade , zero ke flux and a ke spectrum that scales approximately as @xmath0 .",
    "the pe spectrum also follows an approximate @xmath0 power - law with a scale dependent flux of the form @xmath15 . at moderate stratification",
    ", there is no vshf , and the ke spectrum shows a modified form of bolgiano - obukhov  @xcite scaling for 2d flows  approximately @xmath1 at large scales and @xmath0 at small scales .",
    "the ke flux also changes character with scale , and exhibits an inverse ( forward ) transfer at large ( small ) scales .",
    "the pe spectrum follows an approximate @xmath2 scaling and its flux is weakly scale dependent .",
    "finally , for @xmath16 , i.e. , weak stratification , the ke flux is upscale for most scales and its spectrum is characterized by a @xmath17 exponent .",
    "the pe flux continues to be downscale and its spectrum obeys an approximate @xmath4 scaling . all exponents observed are well explained by taking into account the variable nature of the corresponding flux .",
    "exceptions are the pe spectra for moderate and weak stratification whose scaling is little steeper than expected .    the outline of the paper is as follows : in sec .  [",
    "sec : gov_eqn ] , we describe the equations governing stably - stratified ( ss ) flows and the associated parameters . in sec .",

    "it is convenient to work with nondimensional equations using box height @xmath55 as length scale , @xmath56 as velocity scale , and @xmath57 as the temperature scale , which leads to @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",

    "these numbers match very well with the dispersion relation [ eq .",

    "but , the pe does not act as a passive scalar .",
    "indeed , it exhibits an approximate @xmath0 spectrum , and a scale dependent @xmath15 forward flux .",
    "moderate stratification proves to be very interesting , specifically , there is no vshf and we observe a modified bo scaling for the ke  @xmath214 at large scales and an approximate @xmath0 power - law at small scales .",
    "further , the nature of the ke flux also changes , with upscale or inverse transfer at large scales and a weak forward transfer at smaller scales .",
    "the pe , on the other hand , always flows downscale and its flux is weakly scale dependent ( approximately @xmath223 ) .",
    "the pe spectrum scales as @xmath2 , with no signs of a dual scaling like the ke .",
    "but , as the expected change in scaling of the pe spectrum is small , it is possible that higher resolution simulations may prove to be useful in this regard .",
    "weak stratification also differs significantly from pure 2d turbulence .",
    "in particular , we actually see a positive scale dependent enstrophy flux ( @xmath249 ) up to the dissipation scale . in agreement with this form of the enstrophy flux ,",
    "the ke spectrum scales approximately as @xmath3 .",
    "the ke flux is robustly negative , and the inverse transfer begins at a comparitively smaller scale than with moderate stratification .",
    "the pe flux , once again , is positive and almost scale independent , and the pe spectrum follows an approximate @xmath4 scaling law .    thus , the nature of 2d stably stratified turbulence under large scale random forcing is dependent on the strength of the ambient stratification . despite this diversity",
    ", we do observe some universal features .",
    "specifically , the total and potential energy always flow downscale , which is in agreement with 3d stratified turbulence  @xcite .",
    "the ke almost never shows a forward transfer ( apart from the weak downscale transfer at small scales in moderate stratification ) .",
    "in addition , the zero flux of ke in strong stratification , and its upscale transfer at large scales in moderate and weakly stratified cases is in contrast to the 3d scenario . finally , apart from the pe spectrum for weak stratification ( and its small scale behaviour for moderate stratification ) , the scaling exponents observed very closely match dimensional expectations when we take into account the scale dependent form of the corresponding flux .",
