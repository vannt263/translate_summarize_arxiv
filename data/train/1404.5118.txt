    "in current frontiers of optical sciences , interactions of intense and/or ultrashort laser pulses with crystalline solids have been attracting substantial interests from both fundamental and technological points of view @xcite . to describe interactions of visible or infrared laser pulses with crystalline solids ,",
    "it is necessary to calculate time evolution of electron orbitals in a unit cell of solids under a time - varying , spatially - uniform electric field .    in the first - principles level , calculations based on the time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) @xcite have been carried out .",
    "we have been developing a computational method solving the time - dependent kohn - sham ( tdks ) equation in real time in a unit cell of solids in which a uniform grid representation in the three - dimensional cartesian coordinates is used to express orbital wave functions @xcite . a similar computational approach has also been developed and utilized in ref.@xcite .",
    "a computational method employing plane wave basis has also been developed @xcite .",
    "these computational schemes are applicable to electron dynamics in linear regimes @xcite and nonlinear electron dynamics under intense laser pulses @xcite .",
    "there are also a number of works solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation in empirical periodic potentials @xcite .",
    "although numerical methods employing a uniform grid representation in the three - dimensional cartesian coordinates works stably and robustly , time evolution calculations in this representation are computationally demanding .",
    "in particular , the required computational resource is excessively large when we couple the electron dynamics with the dynamics of macroscopic electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "we are thus urged to find a more efficient representation in which computational costs are reduced without harming numerical accuracy . in molecules and nano - sized materials ,",
    "orbital expansions are often utilized for real time evolution calculations .",
    "for example in ref.@xcite , time evolution calculations are achieved in a dense matrix representation employing truncated eigenfunctions of the static kohn - sham hamiltonian with spatial - domain decompositions .    as basis functions in crystalline solids",
    ", one may suppose that a finite number of eigenstates of the static kohn - sham hamiltonian at each @xmath0-point would serve as a natural choice .",
    "however , as will be shown , this truncation scheme does not work well .",
    "we will show that it is crucially important to use basis functions in which occupied eigenstates of nearby @xmath0-points are added to the eigenstates of the original @xmath0-point .",
    "we will illustrate usefulness of the method in the time evolution calculation taking a system of sio@xmath1 described with a time - independent periodic potential .",
    "the construction of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe theoretical frameworks and our proposal for the efficient basis functions . in sec .",
    "iii , we examine usefulness of the proposed basis expansion for linear response problems . in sec .",
    "iv , applications to electron dynamics under pulsed electric fields is discussed . in sec .",
    "v , we discuss computational aspects of the proposed method . in sec .",
    "vi , a summary will be presented .",
    "we consider electron dynamics in a crystalline solid under an optical electric field of visible or infrared frequencies . we assume a long wavelength limit : the wave length of the optical electric field is much longer than the length scale of the electron dynamics induced by the field .",
    "we treat the optical electric field in a unit cell as a time dependent , spatially - uniform electric field .",
    "we consider the following time dependent schdinger equation for the bloch orbitals to describe electron dynamics , iu_n(,t ) = hu_n(,t ) , [ eq : tdse ] where @xmath2 is a time dependent bloch orbital which is periodic in space , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a lattice vector .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath5 $ ] is assumed to have the following form : h= ( + + ( t ) ) ^2+v ( ) [ eq : hamiltonian ] where @xmath6 is a crystalline momentum .",
    "@xmath7 is a time dependent , spatially - uniform vector potential .",
    "it is related to the optical electric field @xmath8 by @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is an effective single - electron potential which is periodic in space .",
    "it may be nonlocal in space to include , for example , a norm - conserving pseudopotential and/or an exchange potential .",
    "when we describe the many - electron dynamics by the time - dependent hartree - fock or the tddft , we need to allow the potential @xmath11 to be time dependent .",
    "to calculate the electron dynamics in practice , we need to express eq .",
    "( [ eq : tdse ] ) in a matrix form . in the real - space grid representation ,",
    "we discretize the equation using uniform grids in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) cartesian coordinates and express the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) as a sparse hermitian matrix @xcite .",
    "we call it the 3d grid representation hereafter .",
    "though this representation is simple and straightforward , it requires large computational resources to carry out simulations for a long period ( typically a few tens of thousand time steps for a few tens of femtosecond ) .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to find representations which require less computational resources without harming accuracy of the results . in this paper , we consider basis expansion methods converting the 3d grid representation into dense matrix representations of smaller dimensions .",
    "we will consider a few choices of basis functions and examine their performances .    to convert the 3d grid representation into a dense matrix representation",
    ", a simple and natural choice may be to adopt a finite set of eigenstates of the static hamiltonian as a basis set to express the time - dependent orbital wave functions .",
    "for each @xmath0-point , we prepare occupied and unoccupied orbitals by solving , h[k]v_n ( ) = _ nv_n ( ) .",
    "[ eq : skseq ] we then expand the bloch orbitals @xmath12 in terms of the eigenfunctions @xmath13 , u_n(,t ) = _ m c_m^n(t)v_m ( ) , [ eq : k - fixed ] where @xmath14 is a time - dependent coefficient for the expansion .",
    "we call it the @xmath0-fixed basis expansion .",
    "if we includes all eigenfunctions in the expansion , it gives the same result as that in the 3d grid representation , since they constitute a complete set .",
    "truncating the unoccupied orbitals , we obtain an approximate matrix equation for the coefficients @xmath15 .",
    "however , as will be shown later , the convergence with respect to the number of unoccupied orbitals is very slow for some observables such as the current induced by the optical electric field , which in turn results in the slow convergence for the real part of the dielectric function .    as an alternative basis set ,",
    "houston states have been extensively investigated and utilized to calculate time evolutions of orbitals @xcite .",
    "the houston states are defined as eigensfunctions of the single - electron hamiltonian @xmath16 $ ] at each time .",
    "they are given by v_m k^h(r ,",
    "t)=v_m k+e a(t)/c(r ) , [ eq : houston ] and are regarded as exact solutions in the adiabatic limit that is the limit of slow variation of the electric field , @xmath8 .",
    "the houston states have been used to investigate bloch oscillations , wannier - stark ladders , and so on @xcite . using the houston states",
    ", we may expand the bloch orbitals as follows , u_n(,t ) = _ m c_m^n(t)v^h_m(,t ) .",
    "we may expect a fast convergence of the calculation for processes in which adiabatic approximation is well satisfied .    in practice , however , there are difficulties in preparing the houston states in the first - principles descriptions . for example , consider a case when two orbitals , one occupied and the other unoccupied , are ( almost ) degenerate at a certain @xmath0-point .",
    "when the crystalline momentum with a shift of vector potential , @xmath17 , goes through the crossing point , it is difficult to decide which orbital should be occupied beyond the point .",
    "because of the difficulty , we will not explore the expansion using the houston states .",
    "instead we will consider an alternative expansion which effectively takes account of important aspects of the houston states .",
    "the essence of the expansion using the houston states is a use of orbitals with crystalline momentum shifted by the external field .",
    "this indicates that we should incorporate orbitals of shifted @xmath0-points in the basis functions , in addition to the orbitals of the original @xmath0-point .",
    "of course , a set of all occupied and unoccupied orbitals for any @xmath0-points spans a complete set .",
    "therefore , any orbitals of a different @xmath0-point may eventually be expressible using eigenfunctions of the original @xmath0-point",
    ". however , inclusion of @xmath0-shifted orbitals remarkably accelerates the convergence of the expansion , as will be shown later .",
    "our prescription to use the orbitals with different @xmath0-points is summarized as follows . to express time - dependent bloch orbitals @xmath18 , we employ occupied orbitals of the hamiltonian in which crystalline momenta are shifted from the original @xmath0-point , @xmath19 , in addition to occupied and unoccupied orbitals of the original @xmath0-point .",
    "we call it the @xmath0-shifted basis expansion .",
    "we expect the houston states @xmath20 may be described well by a superposition of orbitals of the original @xmath0-point , @xmath21 , and those of shifted @xmath0-points , @xmath22 .",
    "we note that orbitals of different @xmath0-points are no more orthogonal to each other . in our practical calculations ,",
    "we first prepare an orthonormalized basis set from orbitals of different @xmath0-points .    in the following section",
    ", we will examine performance of the @xmath0-shifted basis expansion for electron dynamics calculations .",
    "for comparison , we will compare results of @xmath0-shifted basis expansion with those of @xmath0-fixed basis expansion , and with those without any basis expansions , namely , direct calculations in the 3d grid representation .",
    "to test the basis expansion methods , we calculate a dielectric function of @xmath23-quartz using a density functional hamiltonian .",
    "we calculate the dielectric function from a real time evolution of orbitals employing @xmath0-fixed and @xmath0-shifted basis expansions as well as 3d grid representation without any basis expansions .",
    "we note that responses to any weak external fields are fully characterized by the dielectric function .",
    "we use a first - principles density functional hamiltonian in the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite .",
    "we denote the static kohn - sham hamiltonian as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a local potential composed of electron - ion and electron - electron interactions .",
    "@xmath26 is a nonlocal electron - ion interaction in the pseudopotential description @xcite with a separable approximation @xcite .",
    "we ignore local field effects which may be included in the tddft .",
    "we have confirmed that the local field effects are very small in the tddft under the adiabatic lda .",
    "it is well - known that the dielectric functions in the lda are not accurate enough to reproduce measured features .",

    "this choice is equivalent to a constant shift of the vector potential , @xmath38 .",
    "using the impulsive field , the conductivity as a function of time , @xmath39 , is proportional to the induced current , @xmath40 . to reduce numerical noises which originate from a finite period of the calculation",

    ", we sample it using @xmath49 grid points . using the 3d grid representation",
    ", we can directly calculate the time propagation of the orbitals using , for example , the taylor expansion method @xcite .",
    "we will call it the 3d grid calculation .",

    "we use the taylor expansion method for all time - propagation calculations of @xmath0-fixed , @xmath0-shifted basis expansions as well as 3d grid calculations .",
    "we first examine the @xmath0-fixed basis expansion described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : k - fixed ] ) . figure [ fig : eps_re_kfixed ] shows the real part of the dielectric function of @xmath23-quartz using @xmath0-fixed basis expansions with various truncations of unoccupied orbitals as well as that in the 3d grid calculation . in the figure , @xmath0-fixed basis expansions are denoted as @xmath0-fixed ( @xmath50 ) , where @xmath50 is the number of unoccupied orbitals employed in the expansion at each @xmath0-point .",
    "for example , @xmath0-fixed ( @xmath51 ) means employment of @xmath52 occupied and @xmath51 unoccupied orbitals .",
    "we note that , in the calculation of @xmath52 occupied and @xmath51 unoccupied orbitals , the matrix dimension of the hamiltonian is 512 .",
    "this is much smaller than the dimension in the 3d grid representation which is equal to the number of the grid points , @xmath53 .    in the figure",
    ", one can find that the real part of the dielectric function using the @xmath0-fixed basis expansion shows negative divergent behavior which is absent in the 3d grid calculation . the divergent behavior diminishes as the number of unoccupied orbitals employed in the expansion increases .",
    "however , the convergence is rather slow .",
    "even when the @xmath0-fixed basis expansion includes @xmath54 orbitals in total , the dielectric function in the @xmath0-fixed basis expansion is much different from that of the 3d grid calculation .",
    "figure [ fig : eps_im_low_kfixed ] ( a ) shows the imaginary part of the dielectric function below 20 ev , while figure [ fig : eps_im_low_kfixed ] ( b ) shows that above 20 ev . the imaginary part below 20 ev is well described by the @xmath0-fixed basis expansion with any number of unoccupied orbitals , except below 2 ev .",
    "the @xmath0-fixed basis expansion calculation brings unphysical oscillations below 2ev , which are absent in the 3d grid calculation .",
    "this oscillation is sensitive to the number of unoccupied orbitals used in the @xmath0-fixed basis expansion and diminishes with increasing the number of unoccupied orbitals .",
    "we next look at responses at higher energy .",
    "as seen from the panel ( b ) , the result of the @xmath0-fixed basis expansion becomes poor as the excitation energy increases .",
    "this can be explained by the truncation of the basis functions .",
    "the energy difference between the highest occupied orbital and the highest unoccupied orbital in the truncations is given approximately by 19 ev for the @xmath0-fixed ( 48 ) , 31 ev for the @xmath0-fixed ( 96 ) , 51 ev for the @xmath0-fixed ( 208 ) , and 92 ev for the @xmath0-fixed ( 464 ) basis expansions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eps_im_low_kfixed ] ( b ) , one can find a deviation between the 3d grid calculation and the @xmath0-fixed basis expansions starts to occur at the corresponding energies .",
    "for example , results of the @xmath0-fixed ( 48 ) basis expansion and of the 3d grid calculation differ much above 21 ev , which roughly coincides with the energy difference of 19 ev between the highest occupied orbitals and the highest unoccupied orbitals included in the @xmath0-fixed ( 48 ) basis expansion .",
    "we next examine the @xmath0-shifted basis expansion , adding occupied orbitals of nearby @xmath0-points to the basis .",
    "since the magnitude of the vector potential , @xmath28 , may be infinitesimally small in linear response calculations , we may use a small value for the @xmath0-shifts . in practice , for responses in @xmath45-direction , we employ occupied orbitals at shifted @xmath0-points of @xmath55 and at @xmath56 in atomic unit .",
    "we denote the @xmath0-shifted basis expansion as @xmath0-shifted-2 ( @xmath50 ) , where the number 2 indicates that we employ occupied orbitals at two shifted @xmath0-points , @xmath57 in the present case , and @xmath50 represents the number of unoccupied orbitals at the original @xmath0-point .",
    "for example the @xmath0-shifted-2 ( @xmath58 ) basis expansion includes @xmath58 unoccupied orbitals at the original @xmath0-point as well as @xmath59 occupied orbitals at the original @xmath0-point and two shifted @xmath0-points .",

    "[ fig : eps_re_kfixed ] , the present result clearly indicates that the inclusion of the @xmath0-shifted orbitals is essential to describe the linear response accurately .    in fig .",

    "this fact indicates that inclusion of both occupied orbitals of shifted @xmath0-point and unoccupied orbitals of original @xmath0-point are indispensable to correctly describe the liner response .",
    "although we here calculate the dielectric function using the real time method , the importance of including @xmath0-shifted occupied orbitals in linear response calculations should also be true in other computational methods such as the sternheimer method in which linear response for a given frequency is calculated solving linear algebraic equations .      in this subsection",

    "the other is @xmath0-shifted-4 @xmath96 in which four shifted @xmath0-points of @xmath98 and @xmath99 are used .",

    "figure [ fig : current_kshifted4_p125d12_155ev ] shows the currents and the excitation energies as functions of time using basis functions of @xmath0-shifted-4 ( 48 ) and @xmath0-shifted-2 ( 144 ) .",
    "the figure shows that results of the @xmath0-shifted-4 ( 48 ) basis expansion show better agreement with the 3d grid calculation than those of the @xmath0-shifted-2 ( 144 ) basis expansion .",
    "this fact indicates that basis functions which include occupied orbitals of more @xmath0-shifted points are required for electron dynamics induced by pulsed electric field of lower frequencies .",
    "in this section , we discuss computational speed up of the electron dynamics calculation using the basis expansion method . here",
    "we compare the computational time of @xmath0-shifted-4 ( 48 ) basis expansion with that of the 3d grid representation in @xmath23-quartz calculations .",
    "we note that the number of basis functions and the number of grid points required to describe accurately the electron dynamics depend on the material and on the choice of the parameters of pulsed electric fields .",
    "there are two aspects in the basis expansion calculations that contribute to speed up the electron dynamics calculations .",
    "one is the reduction of the matrix dimension . in 3d grid calculations ,",
    "the operation of the hamiltonian on orbitals is an operation of a large - sparse matrix on a vector , while in the @xmath0-shifted basis expansion , a dense matrix operates on a vector . in the present @xmath23-quartz case , the 3d grid calculations employ @xmath102 grid points to describe the bloch orbitals .",
    "this means that the hamiltonian is a @xmath103 sparse matrix .",
    "this is reduced to a @xmath104 dense matrix in the @xmath0-shifted-4 ( 48 ) basis expansion .",
    "the other is a possible use of longer stride of time in the real - time evolution . in explicit methods such as the taylor expansion method which we usually adopt in the 3d grid representation , the stride which provides stable time evolution",
    "is limited by the maximum eigenvalue of the hamiltonian . in the 3d grid representation",
    ", the maximum eigenvalue may be estimated from the grid spacing @xmath105 by @xmath106 .",
    "the maximum eigenvalue in the orbital expansion methods is much smaller than that of 3d grid representation .",
    "we first investigate the speed up coming from the reduction of the matrix dimension .",
    "we compare the computational time of the real - time evolution , employing the same stride of time step , @xmath107 a.u . and",
    "the number of time steps , @xmath108 .",
    "this time step is appropriate in the 3d grid representation .",
    "we confirmed that the time evolution calculation is not stable if we use a larger step , @xmath109 a.u .",
    ", in the 3d grid representation .",
    "the time evolution calculation is carried out at the t2k - tsukuba supercomputer , university of tsukuba .",
    "we employed 64 cpu cores to parallelize the calculation distributing different @xmath0-points , @xmath110 @xmath0-points , into cores .",
    "we have found that the calculation in the 3d grid representation costs 16.71 hours , while the calculation in the @xmath0-shifted-4 ( 48 ) basis expansion costs 1.05 hours .",
    "therefore the speed up by reducing the matrix dimension is about 15 times .",
    "we note that the reduction of the computational time is not simply related to the dimension of the matrix .",
    "since the matrix is sparse in the 3d grid representation while it is dense in the basis expansions , the computational time is much smaller for the sparse matrix if the matrix dimensions are the same .",
    "we next investigate the possibility of employing longer stride for the time step . for the @xmath0-shifted-4 ( 48 )",
    "basis expansion calculation , we have found that we may use @xmath111 a.u . , while the calculation employing @xmath112 a.u .",
    "results in divergence after a short evolution .",
    "therefore , we can use about 3.5 times longer stride of time in the @xmath0-shifted basis expansion than that in the 3d grid representation . combining the two speed up factors , @xmath113",
    ", we can speed up about 50 times in the @xmath0-shifted basis expansion compared with the 3d grid calculation .",
    "in this paper , we explored efficient basis expansion methods to describe electron dynamics in crystalline solids under an intense and ultrashort laser pulse irradiation as well as under a weak field in the linear response .",
    "we utilize a realistic hamiltonian constructed by the first - principles density functional theory . employing uniform grid representation in the three - dimensional cartesian coordinates",
    ", we can calculate the evolution of orbitals robustly .",
    "however , it costs excessive computational costs .    one may expect that a simple and natural choice for the basis functions would be eigenfunctions of static kohn - sham hamiltonian",
    "however , it turned out that the convergence is very slow with respect to the number of orbitals employed .",
    "we then propose to add occupied orbitals of nearby @xmath0-points to the occupied and unoccupied orbitals at original @xmath0-points to mimic the use of houston functions .",
    "we call this procedure the @xmath0-shifted basis expansion .",
    "it was found that the @xmath0-shifted basis expansion dramatically improves the description .",
    "we demonstrate usefulness of the @xmath0-shifted basis expansion numerically , taking examples of responses of sio@xmath1 under weak and strong pulsed electric fields .",
    "we also clarify analytically the reason why the use of the @xmath0-shifted occupied orbitals improves the description .",
    "we also investigated the computational speed up using the @xmath0-shifted basis expansion .",
    "for the electron dynamics calculation of sio@xmath1 , we found a speed up of about 50 times is achieved employing the @xmath0-shifted basis functions , in comparison with the 3d grid representation .",
    "we expect this method will be much beneficial in the calculations of laser - matter interactions , especially when we couple the dynamics of macroscopic electronmagnetism and microscopic electron dynamics .",
