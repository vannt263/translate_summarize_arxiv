    "the key issue is that the size of the system needs to be measured in terms of its correlation length . for these systems",
    "a useful tool to deal with finite - size effects near the critical point of the transition is finite - size scaling @xcite .",
    "let us consider a simple ferromagnetic system , whose thermodynamic variables are : the magnetic moment per particle @xmath0 ( proportional to magnetization ) , the absolute temperature @xmath1 , and the magnetic field @xmath2 .",
    "it is convenient to rescale ( and center ) @xmath1 by means of the critical temperature @xmath3 , yielding the reduced temperature @xmath4 , and to rescale @xmath2 by @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 boltzmann constant ) , yielding the reduced magnetic field @xmath7 .",

    "the former , @xmath0 , will be the order parameter , whereas @xmath8 and @xmath9 are control parameters .",
    "`` near '' the critical point of the transition , defined by @xmath10 , the equation of state fulfills a scaling law , which gives @xmath0 as a function of @xmath9 and @xmath8 as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are critical exponents , and @xmath14 represents two scaling functions , one ( @xmath15 ) for @xmath16 and another one @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "the scaling law ( [ scaling_muth ] ) indicates the invariance of the equation of state under appropriate scale transformations ( which are linear transformations of the axes @xmath19 and @xmath8 ) . by the universality property",

    "as @xmath25 is a smooth function , it is only at the critical point that a sharp transition emerges .",
    "it is important that the correlation length @xmath26 fulfills a scaling law analogous to eq .",
    "( [ scaling_muth ] ) , @xmath27 with @xmath28 another critical exponent and @xmath29 another pair of scaling functions .",
    "then the main fact of critical phenomena is that @xmath26 diverges ( goes to @xmath30 ) right at the critical point ( as @xmath28 and @xmath13 are positive ) .",
    "for instance , at the critical isotherm , @xmath31 , one has @xmath32 , whereas at zero field , @xmath33 .    strictly , all these equations are only valid in the thermodynamic limit . for a system of finite size @xmath34 ( in all dimensions @xcite )",
    "the correlation length can not be infinite .",
    "when @xmath34 is much larger than the correlation length one does not expect that the finiteness of the system has any influence on the behavior of the system ; however , this is not the case when @xmath34 becomes smaller than the correlation length of the corresponding infinite system @xcite .",
    "so , one can introduce a phenomenological additional dependence on @xmath35 in the equation of state @xcite , as @xmath36 which , substituting the equation for @xmath26 [ eq .

    "note that for a finite system with @xmath48 the system size @xmath34 plays a role similar to that of the inverse of the magnetic field in an infinite system , or more precisely , @xmath49 acts as @xmath50 , and in this way , one expects that the first argument of the scaling function @xmath44 in eq .",

    "the galton - watson process starts with one single element that replicates , producing more elements , called offsprings , which also replicate , producing more elements and so on .",

    "it can be proved that there are no other fixed points than the two above @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the case in which the offspring distribution verifies @xmath79 is critical , in the sense that it separates two very different `` phases '' of the system : extinction for sure if @xmath84 and non - sure extinction ( and the possibility of a `` demographic '' explosion ) for @xmath85",

    "note then that @xmath83 becomes the variance of the number of offsprings in the critical case .",
    "there are , though , two quantitative differences : @xmath88 ( in contrast to @xmath20 in the magnetic example above ) and that the ordered phase ( non - zero order parameter ) is above the critical point now . equation ( [ nosecual ] ) also tell us that when the distance to the critical point , @xmath86 , is rescaled by @xmath83 the behavior of the transition is universal , i.e. , independent on the underlying distribution of the number of offsprings @xmath52 .    in this paper",
    "we investigate this phase transition for a finite number of generations , i.e. , when the number of generations is limited by @xmath89 . in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we expanded @xmath90 around the critical point @xmath69 to obtain a general finite - size - scaling law for the probability of survival @xmath72 . here",
    "we follow a different , more direct approach , particularized for a geometric distribution in the number of offsprings , which will allow us to obtain also the corrections to scaling .    after the introduction to finite - size scaling in critical phenomena in the previous section and the introduction to branching processes in this section , in sec .",
    "3 we analyze the finite - size effects in the critical properties of the galton - watson process when the offspring distribution is given by the geometric distribution .",
    "two different order parameters are explored , [ @xmath72 and @xmath91 , and the corrections to scaling and the range of validitity of the scaling law are obtained as well .",

    "5 . previously , in sec . 4",
    ", we establish that our scaling law also describes the escape probability of a simple one - dimensional random walk .",
    "an appendix gives some details of the calculations of secs .",
    "we consider the galton - watson model with a finite number of generations @xmath34 , which means that the process is stopped when it reaches the @xmath92th generation , i.e. , the elements of this generation are not allowed to replicate . viewing the process as a branched tree",
    ", @xmath34 becomes the height of the tree and is therefore a measure of system size ( more precisely , the height of the tree is @xmath93 , counting the @xmath55th generation ) .",
    "the extinction of this process is given by the event @xmath94 , as extinction at any generation @xmath95 is included in the case @xmath94 ( extinction is forever , as it is an absorbing state ) .",

    "although formally the problem is solved by the calculation of @xmath97 , in general it is not feasible to arrive to an explicit expression for the composition , even for small values of @xmath34 .",

    "the only parameter of the distribution is @xmath101 , which is called the success probability .",
    "the geometric distribution has a straightforward interpretation in terms of biological populations . for instance , consider that the elements that replicate are female individuals , and each female has a probability @xmath102 to produce another female and a probability @xmath101 of producing a male .",
    "each female reproduces until it gets a male , and when the male is obtained the mother does not reproduce anymore .",
    "although getting a male is considered a `` success '' ( this is just a name ) , it is the female individuals what are counted as offsprings , so @xmath52 counts the number of females disregading the male .",
    "note that another variant of the geometric distribution counts also the male , this would be for us a shifted geometric distribution and is not considered here .",

    "note that the critical point of the corresponding galton - watson process is at @xmath106 and so @xmath107 , with a critical variance @xmath108 .",
    "the fundamental property ( for our problem ) of the geometric distribution comes from the fact that its probability generating function is a fractional linear function @xcite , also called a linear fractional function @xcite . in this case",

    ", a subcritical galton - watson process corresponds to a random walk with a bias to the negative ( @xmath218 ) increment , for which the hitting probability becomes zero as @xmath51 . on the other hand , the supercritical case corresponds to a random walk with a positive bias in the increment , for which there exists a non - zero probability that never returns to the origin in the limit @xmath51 .",
