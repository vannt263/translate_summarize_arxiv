    "moreover , the existence of a vertex @xmath95 and its conjugate @xmath146 indicates the presence of the undirected walk @xmath42 and , hence , @xmath147 and @xmath146 correspond to the same @xmath25-sequence in @xmath0 ( or vertex in @xmath41 ) .",
    "finally , each adjacency in @xmath144 corresponds to an adjacency in @xmath41 , and digons turn into edges .",
    "in particular , if @xmath0 is a graph , then each vertex of @xmath144 has one conjugate and the digraph @xmath2 has twice the number of vertices of @xmath41 , that is , the @xmath25-sequence graph as it was defined by fiol , yebra and fbrega @xcite .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath0 is a digraph , @xmath41 coincides with the @xmath25-iterated line digraph @xmath30 studied in fiol , yebra and alegre  @xcite .",
    "an example of this situation is shown again in figure [ fig : s3g - l3 g * ] .",
    "note that , in fact , the above theorem shows the existence of a homomorphism from iterated line digraphs to sequence mixed graphs : @xmath148 .",
    "another consequence of theorem [ th : sequencenc - line - digraph ] is the following result .",
    "[ coro - sl = ll ] let @xmath0 be a mixed graph with maximum undirected degree @xmath124 .",

    "all the other adjacencies of @xmath30 remain unchanged in @xmath41 .",
    "then , the claimed isomorphism follows .",
    "[ th : diam - mixed ] let @xmath0 be a mixed graph with diameter @xmath23 and average distance @xmath37 .",
    "then , the diameter @xmath38 and average distance of @xmath39 of the @xmath25-sequence graph @xmath41 satisfy @xmath154    clearly , the associated digraph @xmath2 has the same diameter @xmath23 and average distance @xmath37 as @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , by theorem [ th : diam - line ] , the diameter and average distance of the iterated line digraph @xmath144 satisfy @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "consequently , the result follows since the procedure of theorem [ th : sequencenc - line - digraph ] to obtain @xmath41 from @xmath144 ( by identifying vertices ) clearly does not increase neither the diameter nor the average distance .",
    "that is , @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "note that , in particular , if @xmath0 is a graph , then ( [ eq : dist - mitj ] ) provides a bound for the average distance of its @xmath25-sequence graph , and this extends the result of theorem  [ th : diam ] given in fiol , yebra and fbrega  @xcite .",
    "a constructive proof of the result on the diameter , which also gives a routing algorithm , is the following : given two vertices of @xmath41 , @xmath95 and @xmath159 , let us consider a shortest path from @xmath160 to @xmath161 in @xmath0 , say @xmath162 , of length @xmath163 .",
    "then from our adjacency rule in definition [ def : gen - seq - graphs ] , we can shift the first @xmath25-sequence ( defining @xmath147 ) in @xmath164 to the last one ( defining @xmath138 ) , obtaining a path from @xmath147 to @xmath138 in @xmath41 of length @xmath165 .      for example , if @xmath0 is the kautz digraph @xmath166 on @xmath167 vertices with degree @xmath3 and diameter @xmath3 , its sequence graph @xmath168 has diameter @xmath169 .",
    "both mixed graphs are shown in figure [ fig : s^2(k(2,2 ) ) ] .",
    "as it is implicit in the results of proposition [ prop : reg1 ] , in general the sequence graph operator does not preserve the regularity of a mixed graph .",
    "however , in the context of the degree / diameter problem , our results lead to the following example of application .",
    "the kautz digraphs @xmath170 are mixed moore graphs of diameter @xmath3 for @xmath113 and @xmath171 . from with @xmath86 , proposition [ prop : reg1 ] with @xmath172 , and theorem [ th : diam - mixed ] , its @xmath3-sequence graph has order @xmath173 diameter @xmath169 , undirected degree at most @xmath113 and directed degree at most @xmath174 .",
    "now , we can compare the order of @xmath168 with the moore bound @xmath175 which , according to , is @xmath176 thus , asymptotically , with total degree @xmath177 , the mixed graph @xmath168 has order equal to the moore bound : @xmath178 in fact , notice that , according to corollary [ coro - sl = ll ] , @xmath168 is isomorphic ( up to the equivalence between edges and digons ) with the kautz digraph @xmath179 .    in general , although the sequence mixed graph asymptotically provides good results in the context of the degree / diameter problem , it is far from giving large mixed graphs for small values of @xmath180 and @xmath23 .",
    "for instance , consider @xmath0 to be again the referred bosk graph , with @xmath181 vertices , @xmath182 and @xmath86 . according to proposition [ prop : reg1 ]",
    ", @xmath183 has maximum undirected degree @xmath169 , maximum directed out - degree @xmath169 and diameter @xmath35 .",
    "then , the corresponding moore bound is @xmath184 , although @xmath183 has only @xmath185 vertices . in order to obtain better results ,",
    "we give the following proposition .    [ prop : imp ] let @xmath0 be a @xmath11-regular mixed graph of order @xmath102 , with @xmath58 , @xmath186 , and consider its @xmath25-sequence mixed graph @xmath41 .",
    "then , there exists a mixed graph @xmath187 of order @xmath102 , @xmath188 , and the following maximum degrees :    * for @xmath116 and for some integer @xmath189 , @xmath190 has maximum undirected degree @xmath191 and maximum directed out - degree @xmath192 . * for @xmath193 and for some integer @xmath189 , @xmath187 has maximum undirected degree @xmath194 and maximum directed out - degree @xmath192 .",
    "@xmath49 for @xmath116 , any vertex @xmath120 has exactly @xmath55 in - neighbors and @xmath55 out - neighbors in @xmath105 , so as the induced subgraph of @xmath183 generated by @xmath105 is a @xmath55-regular digraph .",
    "then , if we turn all these arcs of @xmath183 into edges , we obtain the mixed graph @xmath195 having the described properties for @xmath196 .",
    "when @xmath197 , by hall s theorem ( see , for example , brualdi @xcite ) , the induced subgraph of @xmath183 generated by @xmath105 contains an @xmath198-factor ( that is , a spanning @xmath198-regular digraph ) .",
    "then , the claimed mixed graph @xmath190 is obtained , as before , by changing all the arcs of this @xmath198-factor by edges .",
    "@xmath34 the induced subgraph of @xmath41 generated by @xmath105 is no longer a regular digraph when @xmath199 , but it contains a @xmath55-regular subdigraph .",
    "indeed , every vertex @xmath200 is adjacent from ( respectively , to ) the @xmath55 vertices of the form @xmath43 ( respectively , @xmath201 ) where @xmath45 ( respectively , @xmath202 ) is an arc of @xmath0 .",
    "now we reason as in @xmath49 to obtain the result .",
    "proposition [ prop : imp ] is useful when @xmath203 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath187 preserves the maximum undirected degree of @xmath41 , meanwhile the maximum directed degree is reduced by @xmath198 , that is , from @xmath204 to @xmath205 .",
    "this means that the order of @xmath187 has to be compared with the moore bound @xmath206 instead of @xmath207 , for @xmath208 , which is an improvement .",
    "going back to the example of the bosk graph @xmath0 , now @xmath195 has the same order , diameter and undirected degree than @xmath183 , but the directed out - degree becomes now @xmath35 instead of @xmath169 , so as the moore bound reduces from @xmath209 to @xmath210 .",
    "hence , we improve the ratio between the order of the graph and the corresponding moore bound .",
    "note that , in the above modification of the sequence graph of the bosk graph , we are not reducing the diameter .",
    "in contrast , by taking some circulant graphs as a basis , we find out that @xmath187 allows us halving the diameter of @xmath41 ( take , for instance , the circulant graphs with order @xmath211 and set of generators @xmath212 , see yebra , fiol , morillo , and alegre @xcite ) .",
    "the diameters of these modified sequence graphs of circulant graphs do not provide good enough results in the general context of the degree / diameter problem .",
    "thus , an interesting research line would be to give different modifications of @xmath41 in order to get better results in the degree / diameter problem .",
    "for instance , if one were able to lower the diameter of @xmath190 from @xmath35 to @xmath3 , just by replacing / adding some arcs by / or edges without modifying the maximum undirected and directed degrees , then @xmath213 and , hence , the order of this new graph would be very close to the moore bound .",
    "note that the construction of case @xmath34 can be also applied when @xmath0 is a digraph ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "then , the resulting mixed graph has maximum undirected degree @xmath214 and maximum directed degree @xmath205 .",
    "for instance , we know that , if @xmath215 ( the complete symmetric digraph on @xmath216 vertices ) , @xmath217 is the kautz digraph @xmath218 . then , for @xmath219 , we obtain the mixed graph @xmath187 with number of vertices @xmath220 , diameter @xmath25 , and the above maximum degrees @xmath214 and @xmath205 .",
    "then , the ratio @xmath221 turns out to be of the order of @xmath222 , which is asymptotically optimal for a fixed @xmath198 and large @xmath204 .",
