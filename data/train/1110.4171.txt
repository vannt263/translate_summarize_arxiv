    "extensions of the dirac equation have been discussed in great numbers in the scientific literature , including field - theoretical formulations  @xcite . notably , there have been efforts to incorporate space - time curvature into the equation  @xcite , and , to enhance the equation for spin-@xmath18 particles such as the photon , and to map the maxwell equations onto dirac - type equations  @xcite . here ,",
    "we follow a different route and analyze whether it is meaningful and consistent to modify the mass term in the free dirac equation so that the energy - momentum dispersion relation changes from @xmath19 to @xmath20",
    ". the latter dispersion relation would be relevant for superluminal particles , which travel faster than the speed of light .",
    "the tachyonic spin@xmath21 equation reads @xmath22 where the @xmath23 are the dirac matrices , @xmath24 is the derivative with respect to space - time coordinates , and @xmath25 is the fifth current [ here , @xmath26 denotes a space - time four vector ] .",
    "because of the occurrence of the dirac matrices , we propose the name ` tachyonic dirac equation ' .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian density reads @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the dirac adjoint .",
    "it is perhaps not immediately obvious that the @xmath5 matrix has to be placed with the current matrix @xmath23 in the lagrangian ; otherwise an inconsistent equation is obtained for @xmath29 upon variation with respect to @xmath30 .",
    "indeed , the tachyonic dirac equation has been indicated by chodos , hauser and kostelecky in refs .",
    "@xcite in the equivalent form @xmath31 , where the current is modified instead of the mass term ( see also refs .",
    "more recently , the noncovariant ( hamiltonian ) form of the equation has been indicated in refs .",
    "@xcite , with a preliminary ansatz for its solution .",
    "very recently , the equation has been used in the context of the gross - neveu model in ref .",
    "however , neither the complete set of solutions , nor the spectrum , nor the symmetries of the equation have been fully investigated in the literature to the best of our knowledge .    an important observation made in the current work concerns the hamiltonian @xmath32 which is obtained from the tachyonic dirac equation . here , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , with the identification of the dirac matrices discussed below in eq .  .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath17 breaks parity and is non  hermitian but fulfills the pseudo  hermitian equation @xmath35 where @xmath10 is the parity matrix and @xmath11 is the full parity transformation . while the scalar product induced by @xmath11 is not positive semi - definite , a few essential properties of the hamiltonian persist under the pseudo  hermiticity and help to characterize the spectrum .",
    "we thus extend recent work on non - hermitian , but pseudo - hermitian or @xmath36-symmetric hamiltonians  @xcite which have also been applied in the field - theoretical context  @xcite .",
