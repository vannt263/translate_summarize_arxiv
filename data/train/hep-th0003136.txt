    "the proposal of t hooft @xcite , that large-@xmath1 non - abelian gauge theory can be recast as a string theory , has taken an interesting turn with the work of maldacena @xcite .",
    "the principal maldacena duality applies not to confining theories but to conformal  gauge theories , which are dual to iib string theory on @xmath2 .",
    "starting with this duality one can perturb by the addition of mass terms preserving a smaller supersymmetry , or none at all , and in this way obtain a confining gauge theory .",
    "the problem is that the perturbation of the dual string theory appears to produce a spacetime with a naked singularity @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "even basic quantities such a condensates are incalculable .    in this paper",
    "we show that the situation is actually much better .",
    "there is no naked singularity , but rather an expanded brane source , and all physical quantities are calculable .",
    "we believe that this is the first example of a dual supergravity description of a four - dimensional confining gauge theory .",
    "it is also gives new insight into the resolution of naked singularities in string theory .",
    "we focus on perturbations that preserve  supersymmetry , though in fact our solutions are stable under the addition of small additional masses that break the supersymmetry completely .",
    "the vector multiplet contains an  vector multiplet and three chiral multiplets .",
    "we will add finite  supersymmetry - preserving masses to the three chiral multiplets .",
    "for brevity we will refer to this theory as ` ' .",
    "this theory has been studied by many authors @xcite .",
    "it is known to have a rich phase structure @xcite , which includes confining phases that are in the same universality class as those of pure  yang - mills theory .",
    "we will show that the rich structure of this theory is reflected in supergravity in remarkable ways .    to study pure  or  yang - mills theories",
    "would require working at small t hooft coupling and taking the masses of the extra multiplets to infinity .",
    "this is not tractable without an understanding of classical string theory in ramond - ramond backgrounds at large curvature . at large t hooft coupling , where supergravity is valid ,",
    "the masses of the extra multiplets must be kept finite .",
    "however , we emphasize these multiplets are four - dimensional and the ultraviolet theory is conformal .",
    "an alternative approach to obtaining a string dual of confining theories is via high - temperature five - dimensional supersymmetric field theories @xcite , whose low - energy limit is four - dimensional strongly - coupled non - supersymmetric yang - mills theory .",
    "the dual spacetime is non - singular , and the infrared cutoff provided by the temperature does indeed lead to confinement of electric flux tubes . in this case , however , there is a full set of massive five - dimensional states that do not decouple .",
    "our work was motivated by the observation of myers @xcite , that d - branes in a transverse ramond - ramond ( rr ) potential can develop a multipole moment under fields that normally couple to a higher - dimensional brane .",
    "this ` dielectric ' property is analogous to the induced dipole moment of a neutral atom in an electric field .",
    "for example , a collection of @xmath1 d0-branes in an electric rr 4-form flux develops a dipole moment under the corresponding 3-form potential .",
    "one can think of them as blowing up into a spherical d2-brane , and in a strong field the latter is the effective description .",
    "this happens because the d0-brane coordinates become noncommutative .",
    "the original d0-brane charge @xmath1 , which of course is conserved in this process , shows up as a nonzero world - volume field strength on the d2-branes .",
    "even earlier , kabat and taylor @xcite had observed that @xmath1 d0-branes with noncommuting position matrices could be used to build a spherical d2-brane in matrix theory , generalizing the flat membranes of matrix theory  @xcite . for finite @xmath1",
    "the sphere is ` fuzzy ' ; or better , perhaps , it is somewhat granular .",
    "the equations describing this sphere bear a marked similarity to those which appear in the  theory , which were first analyzed in @xcite .",
    "it is then natural to guess that myers mechanism is at work in this theory .",
    "the mass perturbation corresponds to a magnetic rr 3-form flux , which is dual to an electric rr 7-form flux .",
    "the latter couples to the d3-brane in the same fashion as the electric 4-form flux does to the d0-brane , and so the d3-branes polarize into d5-branes with world - volume @xmath3 .",
    "one difference is that myers considers d - branes in flat spacetime ( @xmath4 small ) , whereas for the gauge / gravity duality the background is @xmath5 . in myers case",
    "a small field produced a small d2-sphere , but in the conformal field theory there is no invariant notion of a small mass perturbation , and on the supergravity side there is no such thing as a small transverse two - sphere .",
    "rather , the d5-spheres , which are dynamically ( though not topologically ) stable , wrap an equator of the @xmath6 .",
    "we will show that there exist supergravity solutions in which the only ` singularity ' is that due to the d5-brane source on the @xmath6",
    ".    however , this is far from the whole story .",
    "first , the classical  theory has many isolated vacua @xcite .",
    "for each partition of @xmath1 into integers @xmath7 , there must be a separate solution involving multiple d5-branes with d3-branes charges @xmath7 , each wrapped on an equator of @xmath6 but at different @xmath8 radii @xmath9 proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "we will study these vacua , and their properties , in our discussion below .",
    "second , the quantum theory has even more vacua , which are permuted under the  duality the field theory inherits from @xcite . in particular",
    ", the transformation @xmath10 , which takes the maximally higgsed vacuum into the confining vacuum , will replace the d5-brane sphere with an ns5-brane sphere : _ this is the effective string description of the confining vacuum .",
    "_ the confining flux tubes are bound states of a fundamental string to the ns5-brane , or equivalently , instantons of the 5-brane world - volume noncommutative gauge theory .",
    "meanwhile , the leading nonperturbative condensate corresponds to the three - form field generated by the ns5-brane s magnetic dipole moment .",
    "our removal of the singularity resembles phenomena that occur on the coulomb branch  @xcite and with the repulson singularity that arises in  supergravity duals  @xcite .",
    "there are certainly connections which need to be developed further , but the detailed mechanism is different .",
    "in particular , the appearance of ns - branes is new .",
    "our result also gives insight into perturbations of the randall - sundrum compactification @xcite , and into recent proposals for the solution to the cosmological constant problem @xcite .",
    "we begin in section ii with a review of the classical and quantum field theory vacua , and a discussion of the corresponding brane configurations .",
    "in fact , there are more brane configurations than vacua , but later we will argue that only one configuration is applicable for any given value of the parameters . in section iii we review perturbations of the @xmath8/cft duality , with attention to the issue of the naked singularity .",
    "we show that there is a small parameter : the system can be regarded as a perturbation of one that has only d3-brane charges .",
    "this enables us to obtain a quantitative description even for the rather asymmetric and nonlinear supergravity configuration that results from the expansion of the branes . in section",
    "iv we study a simplified calculation , in which @xmath11 probe d3-branes are introduced into a fixed background .",
    "we find that their potential has minima where they form a d5-brane or ns5-brane , or more generally one or more @xmath12 5-branes , wrapped on an equator of the @xmath6 . in section",
    "v we consider the case that all @xmath1 d3-branes expand into 5-branes .",
    "although this substantially deforms the geometry , serendipitous cancellations allow us to find the effective potential in a simple form : it is the same as in the probe case .",
    "we discuss the stability of the solution , arguing that it survives even when supersymmetry is broken completely . in section",
    "vi we use the dual description to discuss the physics of the gauge theory , including flux tubes and confinement , baryons , domain walls , condensates , instantons , and glueballs . in section vii",
    "we briefly discuss extensions , including the  case and orbifolds , and in section viii we discuss implications and future directions .",
    "in the language of four - dimensional  supersymmetry , the theory consists of a vector multiplet @xmath13 and three chiral multiplets @xmath14 , @xmath15 , all in the adjoint representation of the gauge group .",
    "in addition to the usual gauge - invariant kinetic terms for these fields , the theory has additional interactions summarized in the superpotential . ]",

    "if we write the lowest component of @xmath14 as @xmath21 ( the reason for this notation will become evident later ) , then the potential energy for the scalar fields @xmath22 , @xmath23 , is explicitly @xmath17 invariant : @xmath24[a_m , a_n]\\right)\\ . \\label{supmass}\\ ] ] the theory is conformally invariant , and consists of a continuous set of theories indexed by a marginal coupling @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the theta angle and gauge coupling of the theory .",
    "we can partially break the supersymmetry by adding arbitrary terms to the superpotential .",
    "consider the addition of mass terms @xmath28 if @xmath29 and @xmath30 the theory has  supersymmetry ; otherwise it has .",
    "if @xmath31 and @xmath32 then the theory flows to a conformal fixed point with a smooth moduli space and  duality @xcite . with two nonzero masses , the theory has a moduli space containing special subspaces where charged particles are massless and the khler metric is singular .",
    "however , in , where all three masses are non - zero , there is no moduli space ; the theory has a number of isolated vacua . in the limit",
    "i  , m_i  , ^3 = m_1m_2m_3 e^2i / n  fixed the theory becomes pure  yang - mills theory . for gauge group",
    "@xmath33 the pure  theory has @xmath1 vacua related by a spontaneously broken discrete @xmath18-symmetry .",
    "note that this @xmath18-symmetry is not present in ; it is an accidental symmetry present only in the limit eq .",
    "( [ nonelimit ] ) .",
    "the classical vacua were described by vafa and witten @xcite . assuming all masses are nonzero ,",
    "we may rescale the fields @xmath14 so as to make all the masses equal ; having computed the vacua in this case one may undo this rescaling . in this case the @xmath34-term equations for a supersymmetric vacuum read @xmath35 = -\\frac{m}{\\sqrt 2}\\epsilon_{ijk } \\phi_k \\ . \\label{fterm}\\ ] ] consider the case of @xmath33 .",
    "recalling that the @xmath14 are @xmath36 traceless matrices , it is evident that the solutions to these equations are given by @xmath1-dimensional , generally reducible , representations of the lie algebra @xmath37 .",
    "the irreducible spin @xmath38 representation is one solution ; @xmath1 copies of the trivial representation give another ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "since for every positive integer @xmath40 there is one irreducible @xmath37 representation of dimension @xmath40 , each vacuum corresponds to a partition of @xmath1 into positive integers : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the number of times the dimension @xmath40 representation appears . the number of classical vacua of the theory is given by the number of such partitions .    generally , for a given partition",
    ", the unbroken gauge group is @xmath43/ u(1)$ ] .",
    "for example , if @xmath44 and @xmath45 , then the @xmath14 are block diagonal with blocks of dimension @xmath40 and @xmath46 ; the diagonal traceless matrix which is @xmath47 in each block generates an unbroken @xmath19 gauge symmetry .",
    "clearly we obtain @xmath48 if there are @xmath49 such blocks . however , if @xmath50 , then the two blocks of size @xmath40 can be rotated into each other by additional generators , giving altogether an @xmath37 instead of a @xmath19 .",
    "more generally we obtain @xmath51 . among these vacua",
    "there is a unique one which we will call the ` higgs ' vacuum , in which the @xmath33 gauge group is completely broken .",
    "this is the only ` massive vacuum ' ( meaning that it has a mass gap ) at the classical level . for each divisor @xmath52 of @xmath1",
    "we may take @xmath53 with all others zero , giving a vacuum with a simple unbroken gauge group @xmath54 .",
    "all other vacua have one or more @xmath19 factors ; these are ` coulomb vacua . '",
    "quantum mechanically , the story is even richer .",
    "donagi and witten @xcite found an integrable system which permitted them to write the holomorphic curve and seiberg - witten form describing the quantum mechanical moduli space of the  theory with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "they considered the effect of breaking the supersymmetry to  through nonzero @xmath55 , and showed that the theory has a number of remarkable properties .",
    "each classical vacuum which has unbroken gauge symmetry @xmath56 splits into @xmath49 vacua , all of which have a mass gap .",
    "( coulomb vacua with non - abelian group factors split as well , although a complete accounting of these vacua was not given in @xcite ; since the photons remain massless , such vacua do not have mass gaps . )",
    "the vacuum with @xmath33 unbroken ( @xmath57 , @xmath39 ) splits into @xmath1 massive vacua , exactly the number which would be needed in the  yang - mills theory obtained in the limit eq .",
    "( [ nonelimit ] ) .",
    "the massive quantum vacua are those without @xmath19 factors , and as noted above are associated with the divisors of @xmath1 .",
    "their total number is obviously given by the sum of the divisors of @xmath1 ; it therefore depends in an interesting way , one which does not have a large-@xmath1 limit , on the prime factors of @xmath1 .",
    "the number of coulomb vacua is exponential in @xmath58 .",
    "donagi and witten showed the massive vacua were in a beautiful one - to - one correspondence with the phases of gauge theories classified by t hooft .",
    "let us review this classification @xcite .",
    "@xmath33 gauge theories with only adjoint matter can be probed by sources which carry electric charges in the @xmath59 center of @xmath33 and magnetic charges in the @xmath60 $ ] which characterizes possible dirac strings .",
    "we may think of these charges as lying in an @xmath36 lattice , a @xmath61 group @xmath62 .",
    "t hooft showed that the possible massive phases of @xmath33 gauge theories are associated to the dimension-@xmath1 subgroups @xmath63 of @xmath62 . in each phase , the charges corresponding to the @xmath1 elements of @xmath63 are screened , and all others are confined ; the flux tubes which do the confining are represented by the elements of @xmath64 .",
    "for example , if the ordinary higgs mechanism creates a mass gap , all sources with magnetic charge are confined ; the only unconfined elements of @xmath62 are the @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "thus @xmath63 is generated by the single element @xmath67 .",
    "every magnetic flux tube carries a @xmath59 charge @xmath68 and confines the sources with charge @xmath69 for any @xmath70 . in an ordinary confining vacuum ,",
    "the roles of @xmath70 and @xmath71 are reversed , but otherwise the story is the same .",
    "vacua with oblique confinement are given by groups @xmath63 generated by @xmath72 , where @xmath66 .    more generally , however , the vacua are more complex . as mentioned earlier , each classical vacuum with unbroken @xmath56 symmetry splits into @xmath49 vacua .",
    "these vacua correspond to subgroups @xmath63 generated by @xmath73 and @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "this map of vacua to subgroups is one - to - one and onto .",
    "note the higgs vacuum is the case @xmath77 , while the @xmath1 vacua which survive in the pure  yang - mills theory are the cases @xmath78 for @xmath79 , with @xmath80 being the confining vacuum .",
    "the action of  on the massive vacua is then straightforward @xcite .",
    "the @xmath81 transformation @xmath82 shifts each element @xmath69 of the group @xmath62 to @xmath83 ; all electric charges shift by their magnetic charge , through the witten effect @xcite .",
    "the @xmath84 transformation @xmath85 reverses electric and magnetic charges @xcite : @xmath86 .",
    "thus @xmath84 and @xmath81 map @xmath62 to itself , but act nontrivially on its subgroups @xmath63 .",
    "this action then corresponds to a permutation of the massive vacua . in particular , note that the higgs and confining vacua are exchanged by @xmath84 , while @xmath81 rotates the confining and oblique confining vacua into each other while leaving the higgs vacuum unchanged .",
    "@xmath84 and @xmath81 then generate the entire  group and its action on the vacua .",
    "the coulomb vacua have not been fully classified , and the action of  on them has not yet been understood .",
    "we close the discussion of field theory by noting that this theory is very different from  yang - mills theory in certain respects .",
    "( recently , many of these qualitative points were emphasized in @xcite . )",
    "although it is a four - dimensional theory , it still has massive degrees of freedom ( three weyl fermions and six real scalars in the adjoint representation ) with masses of order @xmath70 .",
    "these massive states ensure that far above the scale @xmath70 ( actually , as we will see , above @xmath87 in the confining phase ) the theory becomes conformal , with gauge coupling @xmath88 .",
    "the important @xmath89 non - anomalous @xmath18-symmetry of the pure  yang - mills theory , a @xmath90 of which is unbroken and a @xmath59 of which permutes the @xmath1 vacua of the theory , is broken explicitly by the presence of the massive fields .",
    "consequently the confining and oblique confining vacua , although still permuted by @xmath91 with @xmath71 an integer , are not related by a discrete @xmath18-symmetry and are not isomorphic .",
    "in particular their superpotentials have different magnitudes and the domain walls between them have a variety of tensions @xcite . in the limit of eq .",
    "( [ nonelimit ] ) , for fixed @xmath1 , the strong coupling scale and the corresponding gluino condensate , domain wall tension , and string tension are all much below the scale @xmath70 of the masses , and so the strong dynamics is not affected by the massive fields .",
    "however , we want to study the gravity dual of this theory , which requires large @xmath92 . in this limit",
    "@xmath93 is of order @xmath70 , and so all of the physics of the theory takes place near the scale @xmath70 .",
    "we will not find the exponentially large hierarchy expected from dimensional transmutation ; this can only be seen at small @xmath92 , outside the supergravity regime .",
    "consider the higgs phase , in which @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the @xmath1-dimensional irreducible representation of @xmath37 .",
    "the scalars @xmath22 are the collective coordinates of the d3-branes , normalized @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "these are therefore noncommutative , but lie on a sphere of radius @xmath97 @xmath98 the nonzero commutator of the collective coordinates corresponds to higher - dimensional brane charge , a fact familiar from matrix theory .",
    "specifically @xcite the d3-branes can be equivalently represented as a single d5-brane of topology @xmath3 , the two - sphere having radius @xmath99 , with @xmath1 units of world - volume magnetic field on the two - sphere .",
    "the higgs vacuum of the four - dimensional theory is represented by this d5-brane .    similarly , a vacuum corresponding to the reducible representation @xmath100 , defined as in eq .",
    "( [ partn ] ) , corresponds to concentric d5-branes , where @xmath42 have radius @xmath101 for each @xmath40 .",
    "consider the case of two spheres , with @xmath102 .",
    "if @xmath103 then the spheres have different radii ; the gauge group of the field theory is @xmath19 .",
    "however , if @xmath104 , the two spheres coincide and the field theory has gauge group @xmath37 . for @xmath105 small , the @xmath37 is broken at a low scale and its w - bosons have mass proportional to @xmath105 . more generally , @xmath49 coincident d5-branes correspond to a classical vacuum with @xmath56 symmetry . just as in the case of flat branes with sixteen supercharges ,",
    "the curved d5-branes with four supercharges and only four - dimensional lorentz invariance show enhanced gauge symmetry when they coincide , and when separated have w - bosons with masses of order the separation distance . in the brane configuration , in parallel with the absence of a @xmath19 in the gauge theory ,",
    "is not completely understood , although we will comment on it in section  vi.h . ]",
    "each classical vacuum of the theory is given by a set of d5 branes of radius @xmath7 , with @xmath106 .",
    "quantum mechanically the situation is much more complicated .",
    "the @xmath84 transformation @xmath85 should exchange the higgs and confining vacua ; therefore by type iib duality the confining vacuum is a single ns5-brane . a @xmath107 transformation ( @xmath108 ) leaves d5-branes unchanged and shifts an ns5-brane to a @xmath109 5-brane .",
    "it follows that the @xmath110 oblique confining vacuum is given by a @xmath109 5-brane .",
    "the @xmath84-duality implies also that there should be vacua with multiple ns5-branes , or generally @xmath109 5-branes , possibly coincident .",
    "in fact we may expect there to be vacua in which different types of 5-brane coexist .",
    "for example , suppose we partition @xmath1 using @xmath111 and @xmath112 , so that the lower @xmath113 block of the fields @xmath14 is zero , leaving @xmath114 unbroken . in this case we would expect a d5-brane of radius @xmath115 representing the broken part of the gauge group , and an ns5-brane ( or a @xmath116 5-brane ) representing an ( oblique ) confining phase of the unbroken @xmath114 subgroup .",
    "we will show that all of these brane configurations do indeed appear in the dual of the  theory .",
    "this is a puzzle , however : the number of brane configurations is much larger than the number of phases . for @xmath117 , for example",
    ", the vacuum with @xmath118 is described by @xmath119 d5-branes of radii @xmath120 . in supergravity , this is clearly @xmath84-dual to the vacuum with @xmath121 , which is therefore described by @xmath119 ns5-branes . however , from investigation of the field theory @xcite , this vacuum also has a description in terms of @xmath122 d5-branes .",
    "we will see , in this and other examples , that our solutions exist only in limited ranges of parameter space , such that only one of the descriptions is valid at a time .",
    "ideally , however , a more complete understanding of how the theory resolves this puzzle would be desirable .",
    "in this section we first review deformations of the @xmath8/cft duality with attention to the issue of singularities , introduce the small parameter that makes the problem tractable , and discuss the field theory perturbation and its supergravity dual .",
    "we then give the iib field equations , develop the necessary tensor spherical harmonics , and solve the field equations to first order in an expansion around @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath124 ,  yang - mills theory is dual to iib string theory on @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the yang - mills coupling is related to the string coupling by @xmath125 , and the common radius of the two factors of spacetime is @xmath126 .",
    "to each local operator @xmath127 of dimension @xmath128 in the cft corresponds two solutions of the linearized field equations @xcite , a nonnormalizable solution which scales as @xmath129 with @xmath99 the @xmath8 radius , and a normalizable solution which scales as @xmath130 .",
    "a supergravity solution which behaves at large @xmath99 as @xmath131 is dual to a field theory with hamiltonian @xmath132 and where the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) is @xcite @xmath133    we will be interested in relevant perturbations , those with @xmath134 . in the field theory these are unimportant in the uv , while in the ir they become large and take the theory to a new fixed point or produce a mass gap . correspondingly the perturbation ( [ linear ] ) is small at large @xmath99 , but at small @xmath99 it becomes large and nonlinear effects become important .    for a theory with a unique ( or at least isolated ) vacuum , the dynamics should determine the vev once the hamiltonian is specified .",
    "this is in accord with the general experience with second order differential equations , where some condition of nonsingularity at small @xmath99 would give one relation for each pair @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "now let us summarize what is known , with attention first to two special cases that make sense :    * 1 .",
    "* in the  theory , @xmath137 , it is actually possible to vary the particular @xmath138 that corresponds to @xmath139 being a scalar bilinear .",
    "the point is that the  theory does not have an isolated vacuum , and varying @xmath138 gives a state on the coulomb branch .",
    "it is important to note that the supergravity solution is still singular , but that the singularity is physically acceptable , corresponding to an extended d3-brane source @xcite .",
    "certain perturbations give a nontrivial fixed point in the ir .",
    "these correspond to supergravity solutions with @xmath8 behavior at large and small @xmath99 , with a domain wall interpolating @xcite .",
    "the vacua do have moduli , but most or all analyses have imposed symmetries which determine a unique vacuum and restrict to a single pair @xmath140 . in these cases",
    "the differential equation does indeed determine @xmath138 .",
    "the condition of @xmath8 behavior in the ir gives a boundary condition , which takes the form of an initial condition for damped potential motion .",
    "more generally , for perturbations that produce a mass gap and destroy the moduli space , the known solutions are singular for all values of @xmath136 @xcite ; for a recent discussion see @xcite .",
    "it does not make sense , however , that such singularities can all be understood as physically acceptable brane or other sources , because that would mean that the vevs are undetermined even though the vacua are isolated .",
    "this is another example of the important observation made by horowitz and myers in the context of negative mass schwarzschild @xcite : string theory does not repair all singularities ; many singular spacetimes do not correspond to any state in string theory .",
    "we will show that the perturbations corresponding to the masses ( [ wmass ] ) actually produce spacetimes with extended brane sources .",
    "the spacetime geometry is singular , but in a way that is fixed by the source , and so in particular the values of @xmath136 are determined .",
    "this resembles the case * 1 * in that there are extended branes , and could in principle be analyzed by supergravity means as in that case : for some subset of the supergravity solutions the singularity will have an acceptable physical interpretation as a brane source .",
    "there has in fact been a search for just such solutions @xcite ; it has thus far been unsuccessful , but some features of our solution have been anticipated .",
    "this approach is extremely difficult , and has generally been restricted to special solutions with constant dilaton .",
    "in fact , the branes in our solution couple to the dilaton , which is therefore position - dependent .",
    "we are able to treat these rather asymmetric geometries without facing the full nonlinearity of supergravity because of the existence of a small parameter .",
    "consider the case of a single d5-brane with d3-brane charge @xmath1 , wrapped on an equator of the @xmath6 .",
    "the area of the two - sphere is of order @xmath141 , so the density of d3-branes is @xmath142 under the rather weak condition @xmath143 , this is large in string units and the effect of the d3-brane charge dominates that of the d5-charge charge . ) ignores the warping of the geometry by the expanded brane , but should be correct in order of magnitude almost everywhere .",
    "in fact , very close to the surface of the two - sphere the effect of the d5-brane dominates . however",
    ", in this regime we can match onto the exact solution for a flat d5-brane with d3-brane charge , as we develop further in section  v.d . ]",
    "the system is therefore well approximated by a coulomb branch configuration of the parent  theory , where the general solution is given by linear superposition in the harmonic function .",
    "thus we can work by treating the d5-brane charge , and the 3-form field strengths that are generated by it , as perturbations .",
    "it is less obvious , but will be seen in section  iv.a , that the full 3-form field strength is effectively proportional to the same small parameter .",

    "one of the surprising features of maldacena s duality is that it relates string theory to a conformal rather than a confining gauge theory .",
    "unconfined electric flux lines between two charged sources in the conformal  field theory are represented by a string in the gravity dual @xcite .",
    "the string in question droops into the @xmath427 space , rather than lying at a fixed @xmath8 radius @xmath99 . since small",
    "@xmath99 corresponds to large distances in the field theory , the drooping string represents flux lines which spread out in the region between the sources , as expected in a nonconfining theory .",
    "the symmetries of @xmath8 space suffice to show that the energy of the string scales as a constant plus a term inversely proportional to the separation of the sources .    in the realization of confining gauge theories via high - temperature five - dimensional field theories",
    "@xcite , the temperature provides an ir cutoff on @xmath99 .",
    "the flux between two charged sources in the field theory now is represented by a string which droops only part way into the @xmath427 space , becoming stuck at a radius of order the temperature @xmath428 ; consequently the string represents flux lines trapped in a physical string - like object , of definite tension and width . in this way the confinement of this theory , which is hoped to be in the same universality class as asymptotically free yang - mills theory , was established",
    "the same happens in our dual description of  gauge theory .    before treating the supergravity picture carefully , we begin with an intuitive argument .",
    "let us assume , as we will shortly show , that a @xmath0 string , with its world - sheet oriented in the @xmath409 directions , can bind to a @xmath0 5-brane with d3-brane charge , in a state of finite width and nonzero tension .",
    "we claim that this object is a confining flux tube of the gauge theory ; since its @xmath8 radius is by construction constant , it certainly has a definite tension .",
    "let us consider @xmath429 , @xmath430 , the higgs vacuum .",
    "the potential between charged electric sources , given by suspending a fundamental string from two points on the @xmath8 boundary , is highly suppressed : the string can split into two strings joining the d5-brane to the boundary , meaning there is little energy cost to moving the endpoints of the string apart . by contrast , a d1-brane can not end on the d5-brane .",
    "however , it can link up with our putative d1-d5/d3 bound state .",
    "this makes the potential between two magnetic sources linear in the distance between them , with a coefficient set by the tension of the bound state .",
    "note also that any @xmath0 string with @xmath431 is similarly confined  its @xmath122 f1 charges ending on the d5 , its @xmath119 charges connected to @xmath119 flux tubes ( or a bound state of such tubes ) on the d5 brane .",
    "it follows that monopoles and dyons , represented by strings with d - charge , are confined in the higgs vacuum , while electric charges are screened .",
    "this is as expected on general grounds from the field theory .    by @xmath84-duality ,",
    "the confining vacuum sports f1-ns5 bound states .",
    "all strings except those having only d1-charge will bind to the d3-ns5-brane .",
    "these bound states are the electric flux tubes of the gauge theory . in this vacuum",
    "it is fundamental string charge which is confined and d - charge which is screened , in agreement with expectations .",
    "similar conclusions hold in the oblique confining vacua .",
    "we now turn to the supergravity description of this physics , and demonstrate that these bound states truly exist . in our solutions the function @xmath161 , given in eq .",
    "( [ zwarp ] ) , diverges at the branes , so all strings can lower their tensions by drooping inward toward one of the branes .",
    "however , we have seen that there is a crossover point near each brane , where the universal d3-brane behavior ceases to hold and 5-brane behavior takes over .",
    "an f - string , representing electric flux , couples to the string metric .",
    "the string stretches in a noncompact direction , so the relevant metric component is @xmath432 . in the d5-solution  ( [ dshell ] ) this still goes to zero at @xmath433 , so electric flux is unconfined . in the ns5-solution  ( [ nshell ] ) it takes the minimum value @xmath434 , so for the confining phase , where @xmath435 and @xmath436 , the tension is @xmath437 this satisfies t hooft scaling , as expected in a confining vacuum .",
    "the f - string lowers its tension , but only by a finite amount , by binding to the ns5-brane .    a d - string , representing magnetic flux , couples to @xmath438 times the string metric . for the ns5-brane this now vanishes at the brane ,- duality ,",
    "but notice that it requires that the string coupling diverge in the ns5-brane throat . for multiple coincident ns5-branes ,",
    "this can be seen in supergravity alone . for one ns brane",
    ", however , the very nature of the throat is in dispute @xcite and it is not clear whether supergravity , worldsheet cft , or semiclassical brane physics gives a good description . in any case , the d - string must dissolve in the ns5-brane , one way or another . ]",
    "but for the d5-brane there is a minimum value @xmath439 .",
    "the higgs phase magnetic tension is then @xmath440 the @xmath152 and @xmath1 scaling appears to be the same as for a classical nielsen - oleson vortex .",
    "the action scales as @xmath441 , and the change in the field , which appears squared , is presumably of order @xmath442 for a @xmath59 vortex .",
    "the d - string is bound to the d5-brane .    though satisfying , these results are partly outside the range of validity of the supergravity description .",
    "we have seen in section  v.d that for d5-branes this description breaks down before the crossover point , while for ns5-branes it is marginal ( we assume @xmath443 ; for @xmath444 the @xmath84-dual is true . )",
    "let us discuss the bound state more carefully in the d5 case , by considering the limit in which the d5-brane is flat .",
    "note first that d1-branes outside a d5-brane are bps saturated and not attracted to the d5-brane .",
    "by contrast , d1-branes outside and parallel to a set of d3-branes are attracted to the d3-branes ; upon reaching the d3-branes they appear as tubes of magnetic flux inside an gauge theory , which , since flux is unconfined , expand to infinite radius . combining the d5 and d3 branes ,",
    "the d1-brane is attracted to the d5/d3 object but upon reaching it can not expand to arbitrary size .",
    "its behavior within the d3-brane field theory is determined by the semiclassical calculation of the vortex soliton which confines magnetic flux .",
    "alternatively , it should be a semiclassical instanton of the noncommutative field theory on the 5-brane @xcite .",
    "another intuitive way to see the bound state is to use @xmath81-duality .",
    "begin with a d1-brane extended in the 01-directions , a 012345 d5-brane , and 0123 d3-branes which are distributed in the 45-directions with density @xmath445 .",
    "a @xmath81-duality in the 5-direction converts the d1-brane into a 015 d2-brane and the d5/d3 system into a d4 brane , which fills 0123 plus a line in the 45-plane .",
    "the line makes an angle @xmath158 with the 5-axis , where @xmath446 if @xmath447 ( @xmath448 ) , the d2 and d4 are perpendicular and bps , so there is no force on the d2 .",
    "if @xmath449 ( @xmath450 ) , then the d2 can be absorbed by the d4 .",
    "but if @xmath451 the d2 brane is attracted to the d4 but is misaligned with it , and so can not be completely absorbed . instead , only a part of it is absorbed , leading to a d2-d4 bound state of finite energy and size .",
    "as shown in figure  1 , the tension is reduced by a factor @xmath452 .",
    "in fact , this bound state is supersymmetric : as one sees from figure  1 , after the flux dissolves to the maximal extent , the remaining state is a d2-brane ending on a d4-brane , a familiar supersymmetric configuration .",
    "the bps bound @xcite is @xmath453^{1/2 } - \\bigl[v \\tau_{\\rm d4}^2 + v \\tau_{\\rm d4}^2 \\cot^2\\theta \\bigr]^{1/2 } = \\frac{\\tau_{\\rm d_2 } } { \\sin\\theta}\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath13 is a large regulator volume in the 123 directions .",
    "having established that a bps state exists in this limit , we should now verify that a nearly - bps state of essentially the same mass is still present when the d5-brane has the shape of a two - sphere .",
    "the d1-d5/d3 bound state is in a rather difficult region of parameter space because the effect of gravity is large ( because the d3 charge is large ) but the gravity description is not valid everywhere ( because the d1 and d5 charges are small ) . at large @xmath99 the supergravity description is valid , while at small @xmath99 the effective description is the field theory on the brane , as in examples in ref .",
    "it appears that a correct treatment requires that we match these two descriptions , in the spirit of the correspondence principle  @xcite . by the logic of section v.d",
    ", the crossover between the two descriptions occurs at a radius @xmath454 we will see that it is interesting to retain an undetermined constant @xmath455 in the crossover point . at the crossover ,",
    "the metrics in the 0123 and the 45 ( @xmath456 ) directions are @xmath457 the area of the two - sphere is then @xmath458 giving @xmath459 combining the d1 tension , the rescaling of @xmath432 , and the effect shown in figure  1 gives the tension @xmath460    this is the same as the estimate  ( [ tmag ] ) which came from the purely gravitational picture ; it is independent of the precise crossover @xmath455 ( a necessary , though not sufficient , condition for correspondence arguments to give a correct numerical value ) ; and , one gets the same result if one ignores the gravitational effect entirely and takes unit coefficients in the metric  ( [ cormet ] ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the @xmath59 strings of supersymmetric qcd might be nearly bps saturated in the limit of infinite @xmath1 . in  this hope",
    "is realized , although we see that large @xmath4 is necessary for this to be the case .",
    "but we have not yet explained why the strings carry charges which are conserved only mod @xmath1 .",
    "to do so , we turn to the construction of the baryon vertex .",
    "to put @xmath1 sources in the fundamental representation into a gauge invariant configuration requires a baryon vertex . in the @xmath461 supergravity dual of  yang - mills",
    "this vertex is given by a d5-brane which wraps the entire @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we will see that in , by contrast , the baryon vertex is a d3-brane with the topology of a ball @xmath462 , whose boundary is the two - sphere of the 5-branes which form the vacuum .",
    "the link between these two pictures is the hanany - witten brane - creation mechanism @xcite .",
    "one way to derive the nature of the baryon vertex in the theory is to begin in the ultraviolet .",
    "the ultraviolet theory is supersymmetric and the spacetime is approximately @xmath146 .",
    "let us consider the confining vacuum , represented by an ns5-brane two - sphere .",
    "a baryon vertex joining charged sources in a small spatial region corresponds to a d5-brane wrapping the @xmath6 near the @xmath427 boundary , with @xmath1 fundamental strings joining the boundary and the d5-brane .",
    "now let the region containing the sources grow comparable to the ir cutoff distance @xmath463 ( we will give a more precise estimate in section  vi.h ) . the @xmath427 radius of the d5-brane decreases until it eventually crosses the ns5-brane .",
    "since drawing the sources further apart than @xmath463 should lead to a large energy cost , something dramatic must happen at this scale . and indeed , it does : the crossing of the d5- and ns5-brane produces a d3-brane which connects the two .    to see this ,",
    "consider the configuration more carefully .",
    "the brane - creation process is local , so let us consider a nearly - flat portion of the ns5-brane , which extends in the @xmath464-directions .",
    "the d5-brane locally extends in the @xmath465-directions .",
    "the distance vector between the two branes lies in the @xmath466-direction . in this arrangement ,",
    "the crossing of the branes leads to the creation of a d3-brane which fills the dimensions @xmath467 .",
    "the transition is shown in figure 2 .",
    "looking globally at the two - sphere , we see that the d3-brane fills the part of the ns5-brane two - sphere which lies outside the d5-brane .",
    "but the space inside the ns5-brane is topologically flat ; the radius of the five - sphere shrinks to zero inside .",
    "the d5-brane therefore is topologically unstable and can be shrunk to zero radius , leaving a d3-brane which fills the entire two - sphere inside the ns5-brane . like the d5-brane which created it",
    ", this d3-brane is a particle in the four - dimensional spacetime ; more precisely , it is a localized object whose size is of order @xmath463 . if the charged sources are taken to lie further apart than this , then they will connect to the d3-brane not directly but through f1-ns5 flux tubes ; thus the baryon vertex behaves dynamically as we would expect in a confining theory .",
    "the d5-brane baryon vertex in the theory has no preferred size or energy . here",
    ", the d3-brane actually represents a physical excitation of definite size and mass .",
    "the mass is @xmath468 note that this diverges , due to a net factor @xmath469 in the integrand , until the near - shell form is taken into account .",
    "the result is a factor of @xmath1 times t hooft scaling , as would be expected .    to see directly that the d3-ball is a baryon vertex , note that the ns5-brane world - volume action includes a chern - simons term @xmath470 this is the @xmath84-dual of the term @xmath471 in the d5-brane action , which is familiar as it implies that a world - volume gauge instanton is a dissolved d1-brane .",
    "the d3-brane ending on the ns5-brane is a magnetic monopole source for @xmath472 ( the @xmath84-dual of a familiar fact for d3- and d5-branes ) , while the dissolved d3-branes become @xmath1 units of @xmath472 . under @xmath473 , @xmath474 this violation , proportional to the number of dissolved d3-branes , must be offset by @xmath1 fundamental strings ending at the d3-ns5 junction .",
    "note that this now also explains the @xmath59 quantum numbers of the flux tubes .",
    "if we place @xmath1 flux tubes close and parallel to each other , pair - creation of these d3-branes can occur .",
    "this allows the flux tubes to annihilate in groups of @xmath1 .",
    "application of @xmath84-duality allows us to form the same construction for other similar vacua .",
    "notice that the baryon vertex is always a d3-brane .",
    "however , the 5-brane on which it ends determines its properties .",
    "for example , if we are in the higgs vacuum , the magnetic flux and its magnetic baryon form the @xmath84-dual of what we just considered .",
    "by contrast , the electric baryon is completely shielded : the @xmath1 fundamental string sources , which in the confining vacuum were forced to end on the d3-brane , are no longer forced to do so , since they may end anywhere on the d5-brane .",
    "this is of course consistent with field theory expectations .",
    "now let us consider some other vacua .",
    "suppose that we take a vacuum where the classical unbroken gauge group was @xmath475 , with @xmath476 a small divisor of @xmath1 .",
    "since only the @xmath475 confines , and since a fundamental representation of the @xmath33 parent breaks up into @xmath49 copies of the fundamental representation of @xmath475 , we should expect that @xmath1 sources would now be joined by not one but @xmath49 different baryon vertices . to see this in the supergravity is straightforward .",
    "the relevant vacuum is given by @xmath49 coincident ns5-branes , so when the d5-brane baryon vertex of  crosses the ns5-branes , @xmath49 d3-branes are created .",
    "each of these carries @xmath477 units of string charge ( since each ns5-brane has @xmath477 units of d3-brane charge ) and so @xmath477 strings must end on each of them . on the other hand , the @xmath49 d3-branes are not bound together and may be separated spatially from one another .",
    "each one represents a separate , dynamical , massive baryon vertex of @xmath475 .",
    "note also that pair creation of these objects ensures that the electric flux tubes in this vacuum carry only @xmath478 quantum numbers .      here",
    "we will look at coulomb vacua to understand how the baryons and strings behave , and obtain the correct flux tube quantum numbers .",
    "we have already noted the flux tubes present when the vacuum is massive  that is , when the classical vacuum is given by @xmath49 copies of the @xmath477-dimensional representation of @xmath37 .",
    "the baryons ensured that the electric flux tubes carry flux in @xmath479 and the magnetic or dyonic flux tubes have charge in @xmath478 .",
    "let us consider instead a general coulomb vacuum , given by choosing @xmath480 copies of the @xmath481-dimensional representation , with @xmath482 . the unbroken gauge group is @xmath483 / u(1)$ ] , corresponding to @xmath480 d5-branes of @xmath8 radius proportional to @xmath481 .",
    "let @xmath99 to be the greatest common divisor of the @xmath480 , and @xmath484 .",
    "simple field theoretic arguments then determine the properties of possible flux tubes .",
    "the topology of the breaking pattern of the gauge group permits magnetic flux tubes to carry a @xmath485 charge , while the massive @xmath486-bosons of the theory will break all electric flux tubes down to those carrying a @xmath487 charge .",
    "how do we see these flux - charges in the supergravity ? for the magnetic flux , it is straightforward . consider a collection of @xmath49 magnetic flux tubes .",
    "a magnetic flux tube can be moved with impunity from one d5-brane to another , since two flux tubes on different d5-branes can be connected by a d1-string in the radial direction , corresponding to a magnetic gauge boson . a magnetic baryon vertex connecting to a d5-brane of radius @xmath488 can remove or add @xmath488 flux tubes from the @xmath49 that we started with . since we may move all the flux tubes from the first group of d5-branes to the second group , we may also remove any multiple of @xmath489 flux tubes from our collection . removing @xmath481 flux tubes in any combination , we are left with a number @xmath490 with @xmath491 .",
    "this confirms what we set out to prove .    to see the charges of the electric flux tubes requires @xmath84-duality , which in not understood for the general coulomb vacuum",
    "however , we conjecture that the @xmath492 transformation acts in a simple way in an important subclass of the vacua . in particular , consider those classes of vacua _ where all @xmath493 are distinct integers and all @xmath494 are distinct integers . _ in this case we claim that the @xmath84-dual of this vacuum is that with @xmath481 ns5-branes of radius @xmath480 .",

    "the @xmath84-dual of the argument in the previous paragraph then shows that the electric flux tubes for these vacua is indeed @xmath487 .",
    "indeed , this is our main evidence for the conjecture .",
    "if the @xmath480 or the @xmath481 are not distinct integers , then the @xmath84-duality transformation we have suggested is ambiguous .",
    "we do not know what happens in this case , either in field theory or in supergravity .      since the theory has many isolated vacua",
    ", it also has a large number of domain walls which can separate two spatial regions in different vacua .",
    "if the walls are spatially uniform then they may be bps saturated @xcite .    between the oblique confining vacuum represented by a @xmath496 5-brane sphere and the confining vacuum represented by an ns5-brane , there must be a bps domain wall which carries off one unit of d5-brane charge .",
    "we may therefore conjecture that a bps junction of three 5-branes  the ns5-brane sphere for @xmath497 , the @xmath496 5-brane sphere for @xmath498 , and a d5-brane at @xmath499 which fills the two - sphere  describes this domain wall .",

    "the ns5-brane and the @xmath496 brane are nearly coincident ( their @xmath8 radius and orientation on the @xmath6 differ only at order @xmath152 ) and the effect of the d5-brane on the much denser ns5-brane is very small .",
    "we can see that this reproduces some known properties of the domain wall .",
    "first @xcite , the flux tubes of the theory ( f1 strings ) obviously can end on the domain wall ( a d5-brane ) .",
    "furthermore , consider dragging a @xmath496 dyonic string , representing a dyonic source in the gauge theory , across the wall . for @xmath498 ,",
    "the dyon is screened ; it can end happily on the @xmath496 5-brane . for @xmath497",
    ", the dyon is confined ; its monopole charge ends on the ns5-brane , but its electric charge must join onto a flux tube  an f1-ns5 bound state  which in turn ends on the d5-brane domain wall .",
    "finally , note that we may dissolve an @xmath1-string vertex ( a d3-brane ) into this domain wall ( a d5-brane ) , leaving @xmath1 strings which end on the wall and are free to move around on it .",
    "if we then permit this domain wall to annihilate with an antidomain wall with no strings attached , then the annihilation will leave a d3-brane behind on which the strings may end , as in the well - known process described in @xcite .    more generally ,",
    "if for @xmath498 the system is in the phase corresponding to a @xmath12 5-brane , and for @xmath501 it is in the phase corresponding to a @xmath502 5-brane , then a @xmath503 5-brane must fill the 2-sphere where they meet .",
    "in general the branes on the right and left have different orientations and radii , and so must bend as they meet as depicted in figure  3 .",
    "when the left and right phases involve multiple spheres , there will be a more complicated domain wall , constructed from multiple triple 5-brane junctions .    to discuss the domain wall tensions quantitatively",
    "we need the kinetic term for the collective coordinate @xmath504 .",
    "this arises in the born - infeld action , from @xmath505 then @xmath506 this gives the khler potential @xmath507 .",
    "this is the same as  eq .",

    "the tension is @xmath523 let us consider two examples , to see that the 5-brane junction construction reproduces this tension .",
    "for both examples we take @xmath524 .",
    "the first is the domain wall described above , between the confining and first oblique confining phase .",
    "the general result  ( [ dwtens ] ) becomes @xmath525 in the brane picture , the tension comes from the spanning d5-brane .",
    "this has three transverse and three longitudinal dimensions and so feels no warp factor , giving simply @xmath526 the agreement is quite beautiful , given the very different physics that has gone into the two calculations .",
    "the second example is the domain wall between the confining and higgs phases : a junction between an ns5-brane and a d5-brane , spanned by a ( 1,1 ) 5-brane .",
    "the ns5-brane is at much smaller radius than the d5-brane ( by a factor @xmath152 ) and has much greater tension ,",
    "so the predominant effect is that the d5-brane bends down to join the ns5-brane .",
    "the bending is described by the bps equation @xmath527 with @xmath528 any phase . for @xmath70",
    "real , @xmath529 gives a solution that passes through the origin and the nonzero stationary point , approximating to order @xmath152 the solution needed .",
    "the tension comes primarily from this bending , @xmath530 in this case the general result  ( [ dwtens ] ) follows by construction @xmath531 where the superpotential in the confining phase is smaller by @xmath532 .",
    "it will be an interesting exercise to show that the brane construction reproduces  eq .",
    "( [ dwtens ] ) in the general case , without assuming small @xmath152 .",
    "note that a domain wall is the same as a baryon vertex extended in two additional directions . by analogy",
    ", we might expect the d5-brane three - ball which acts as a domain wall to be associated with passing a d7-brane through the ns5-brane .",
    "this suggests that d7-branes should be reexamined in the original @xmath146 context .",
    "it is amusing that  is rich enough to permit us to study a theory similar to qcd with heavy quarks .",
    "suppose we consider a vacuum with a d5-brane of radius @xmath71 and one ns5-brane of radius @xmath533 .",
    "here we assume the usual condition on @xmath71 , @xmath534 , but take @xmath535 , so the d5-branes have comparable @xmath8 radius to the ns5-brane .",
    "in the field theory this corresponds to a vacuum with a broken @xmath536 sector , a @xmath19 vector multiplet , and a confining @xmath537 sector . among the massive vector multiplets",
    "are spin-1 bosons , along with fermions and scalars , charged as @xmath538 under @xmath539 .",
    "these are strings connecting the d5-brane to the ns5-brane",
    ". we will refer to these as ` quarks ' .",
    "clearly these theories have no free quarks : the d5-ns5 strings can not exist in isolation , since they can not actually end on the ns5-brane , and instead must be connected to a flux tube .",
    "note that the @xmath536 acts as a sort of flavor group for the quarks ( analogous to broken weak isospin ) , and we will refer to its massive adjoint representation as ` flavor ' gauge multiplets .    in order that the supergravity solution be valid",
    ", we must have @xmath540 .",
    "when @xmath541 , so that the d5 and ns5 sit at equal @xmath8 radii , the quark has mass of order @xmath542 which agrees with field theory .",
    "however , it is easy to see that if @xmath71 is smaller than @xmath4 , the quark retains mass @xmath543 ; indeed , as an extreme , note that if a d3-brane sits exactly at @xmath327 , corresponding to @xmath544 , the quark mass is just proportional to the coordinate length of the string , @xmath545 .",
    "we therefore see signs that the physical ` constituent ' masses of the quarks can be much larger than their current values .",
    "of course the quarks are never light compared to @xmath70 .",
    "we can see easily that qcd - like theories have no stable flux tubes due to quark pair production . recall that we measure the potential @xmath546 between two electric sources by hanging a probe string by its ends from the @xmath8 boundary , with the ends a distance @xmath62 apart .",
    "take @xmath547 ; then in the absence of the d5-brane , the probe would bind to the ns5-brane forming a confining flux tube between the sources . in the presence of the d5-brane ,",
    "however , pair production of the d5-ns5 strings can occur .",
    "this breaks the flux tube , which shrinks away allowing the quark to screen the source .",
    "the probe string ends up as two strings a distance @xmath62 apart , each attached to the d5-brane .",
    "note however that if we take @xmath548 , the quarks become very heavy , and the time scale for their pair production becomes very long . in this limit",
    "the confining flux tubes are metastable .",
    "low - lying quark - antiquark mesons are not stable in this theory .",
    "highly excited mesons are represented by two d5-ns5 strings joined by a long f1-ns5 flux tube . however , as the mesons deexcite by emission of glueballs ( either supergravity or string states ) , it eventually becomes energetically preferable for them to decay to a d5-d5 string , bypassing the ns5-brane altogether . in short , the lowest lying mesons between two quarks always mix with and decay to a massive , but lighter , flavor particle , in a vector multiplet of the broken @xmath536 group .",
    "( indeed this almost happens in nature ; charged pions decay through isospin gauge multiplets , although not because those gauge bosons are light but because they couple to light leptonic states  which could also be represented here , if there were a need . )",
    "baryons , on the other hand , carry a conserved charge and are both stable and interesting .",
    "@xmath533 d5-ns5 strings can end on a d3-brane filling the ns5-brane two - sphere , forming an object whose mass can be computed .",
    "if we arrange for a more complicated spectrum of quarks by choosing to use multiple d5-branes of various radii , then there are processes by which baryons can be built from quarks of different masses , and can decay by emission of flavored mesons ( or the corresponding gauge multiplets of the ` flavor ' group . ) scattering of baryons , or of baryons and antibaryons , could also be studied .",
    "in addition , it is possible that these baryons have residual attractive short range interactions ( different from the physical case in that they are dominated by the ` flavor ' gauge multiplets ) which can cause them to form nuclei",
    ". it would be amusing to look for such baryon - baryon bound states .",
    "furthermore , these baryons and nuclei carry @xmath19 gauge charges , and in some vacua there are lepton - like objects which presumably can combine with them to form atoms",
    ".    we can not resist mentioning one more possibility , although it admittedly may not be realized .",
    "namely , our baryons act as d0 branes in spacetime , and our domain walls as d2-branes ( their structure in the extra dimensions is identical , so we suppress it . ) while we are not used to thinking of baryons as places where strings can end , this is quite natural if there are no light quarks ; if all quarks are heavy then short flux tubes are stable , and physical baryons can be linked by them .",
    "turning on condensates of these flux tubes makes the positions of the baryons noncommuting ( note these branes have no massless world - volume gauge fields , but still have massless scalars ) , and through the kabat and taylor mechanism @xcite , an assembly of baryons can be arranged into a spherical domain wall !",
    "thus the properties of the gauge theory recapitulate the method we have used to solve it . in practise , one should try to implement this process physically , through myers mechanism @xcite .",
    "here we have a difficulty , as the required three - form potential is a massive state , a glueball which couples to domain walls @xcite , so we can not create a long - range field to induce a dipole charge .",
    "however , there may be ways to circumvent this problem , and create this effect as a thought experiment or even in a lattice simulation , where hints of domain walls have been observed @xcite .",
    "with the naked singularity banished , the coefficients of the normalizable terms in the supergravity fields , and so the dual condensates , become calculable .",
    "we have already determined the superpotential in our discussion of domain walls , and in principle the condensates can be determined directly from this function .",
    "the full field theoretic superpotential , and corresponding condensates , are also known @xcite .",
    "however there are subtleties @xcite , and our understanding is only partial .",
    "the condensates of the operators @xmath549 , @xmath550\\phi_3 $ ] and @xmath551 are all related by the chiral anomaly and operator mixing . a linear combination of these must couple , by the @xmath8/cft correspondence , to the mode of @xmath173 which falls off as @xmath552 in invariant units , which we have identified in eq .",
    "( [ perts ] ) .",
    "more generally , higher modes of @xmath173 should give the expectation values of all of the chiral operators @xmath553 .",
    "for the lowest mode of @xmath173 , eq .",
    "( [ onasy ] ) for @xmath554 gives the @xmath70 and phase dependent parts as @xmath555 for multiple shells , superposition gives @xmath556 note that there are two @xmath295-invariant fermion bilinears , namely @xmath557 and @xmath558 .",
    "these correspond to the polarization tensors @xmath559 and @xmath560 , which have equal overlap with the actual field @xmath561 .    in the higgs vacuum , and other vacua with only large d5-branes ,",
    "all condensates can be described semiclassically .",
    "the expectation values for @xmath562\\phi_3 $ ] and @xmath551 are known , and their @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath309 scaling agrees with ( [ multiplevev ] ) . in the confining cases , however , the situation is more subtle , since these operators have condensates of different sizes and since the gluino bilinear is also expected to play a role .",
    "we note the following facts .",
    "first , careful examination of the field theory superpotential given in @xcite reveals no obvious linear combination of the operators whose expectation values would have this property  except the second term in the superpotential itself , as discussed in section vii.d .",
    "second , there is every indication from our study of domain walls that the second term in the superpotential , proportional to the two - sphere volume times the 5-brane s charge under @xmath563 , measures the dipole moment of the 5-branes . naturally , the lowest normalizable mode of @xmath173 couples to the lowest allowable 5-brane multipole moment , which is indeed a magnetic dipole .",
    "we therefore speculate that perhaps the @xmath564 components of @xmath173 couple to this part of the superpotential , and to the worldsheet instantons which we will discuss in section vii.g below .    in any case",
    ", the supergravity clearly shows that there are expectation values for some dimension - three operators which classically would have had vanishing vevs .",
    "it also shows these vevs differ from one confining vacuum to the next .",
    "these qualitative features certainly agree with field theory .",
    "the chiral operators @xmath565 are determined by the dilaton background .",
    "the dilaton is nontrivial and is obtained from @xmath566 the first term comes from the coupling of the dilaton to the 5-brane through the born - infeld action .",
    "the second is directly from the coupling to the bulk fields . taking the value of @xmath321 appropriate to a single shell of quantum numbers @xmath309 , and integrating over a volume of order @xmath567 , both terms are of order @xmath568 and",
    "must be retained .",
    "one can argue that they must cancel in the dilaton monopole , which gives the expectation value of the derivative of the lagrangian with respect to the coupling ; this must vanish in a supersymmetric vacuum .",
    "many of the higher operators @xmath565 are also highest components of superfields , and for them a similar argument should apply .",
    "we have not yet shown this cancellation directly for the background  ( [ dilback ] ) , and it is possible that there are subtleties .",
    "it is a challenge to include this varying dilaton in the full nonlinear treatment of supergravity .      at weak coupling ,",
    "many quantities in  yang - mills theory receive contributions from instantons .",
    "holomorphic objects can be written as an instanton expansion , given by an infinite series in powers of the parameter @xmath569 .",
    "this expansion is not useful at strong coupling , but in that case the same objects can typically be reexpressed , using a modular transformation , in terms of @xmath570 ( or some other @xmath571 variant . ) in string theory , both in perturbation theory for flat d3 branes and in the @xmath146 language , d - instantons [ d-(@xmath572 ) branes ] , whose action is @xmath573 , play the role of these field theory instantons . for large @xmath152",
    "one uses an expansion in magnetic d - instantons , with action @xmath574 , or more generally in dyonic d - instantons .    in , the situation is slightly different .",
    "consider first weak t hooft coupling , such that the strong coupling scale @xmath575 is much less than @xmath70 . in this case",
    "the higgs vacuum has a superpotential which is an expansion in @xmath569 , but the superpotential of the confining vacuum has an expansion in @xmath576 .",
    "the @xmath442 in the exponent is responsible , in the @xmath577 limit , for @xmath33 yang - mills having @xmath1 vacua , related by @xmath578 .",
    "it has long been suggested that this behavior implies the existence of fractional instantons , carrying @xmath442 units of instanton charge , which , unlike instantons themselves , remain important in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "some evidence for these objects has been found in mqcd @xcite ( note that these are distinct from similar objects which require compactification of a dimension of spacetime for their existence ) and there is even a claim that they have been seen in lattice nonsupersymmetric yang - mills @xcite .    we might hope to find such objects here , but for the same reason that @xmath579 , we can not do so , for @xmath576",
    "is of order one , and the fractional - instanton expansion fails .",
    "we also can not use the magnetic instanton expansion , since @xmath580 .",
    "but remarkably , as can be inferred from the results of @xcite , there is yet another expansion , one which is dual , in the sense of @xmath581 , to the expansion in fractional instantons .",
    "in particular , dorey and kumar show that the superpotential for the confining vacuum is proportional to @xmath582 where @xmath514 is the second eisenstein series . for large imaginary arguments",
    ", @xmath583 can be written as an expansion in @xmath584 . the first term in ( [ etwos ] )",
    "can therefore be interpreted as a sum over ordinary instantons . the second term , by contrast , can not be expanded in this way , since @xmath585 . however , since @xmath586 is large and imaginary , we may make progress as in @xcite by using the anomalous modular transformation @xmath587 from which we learn that the second term in eq .",
    "( [ etwos ] ) dominates the first and that it can be expanded in power of @xmath588 .",
    "this is an expansion in a small quantity , and we need only provide an interpretation for it .",

    "we will outline its structure and point out some puzzles and problems which must be solved in future .",
    "first , there is already surprising structure in the  theory in the vacuum with @xmath161 given by eq .",
    "( [ zwarp ] ) , where the d3-branes form a 2-sphere of radius @xmath321 .",
    "the typical warp factor in the region @xmath592 is @xmath593 .",
    "a supergravity state then has typical @xmath594 given by  @xcite @xmath595 so that @xmath596 where the minus ( plus ) sign applies for the d3-sphere radius appropriate to the higgs ( confining ) vacuum .",
    "immediately we have a puzzle .",
    "the semiclassical field theory of this  vacuum would have led us to expect physics from the @xmath486-bosons whose masses lie between the scales @xmath70 and @xmath597 .",
    "there are also monopoles of masses @xmath598 and @xmath599 .",
    "these states are present on the supergravity side as f- and d - strings stretched between the d3-branes .",
    "but there is no sign of gauge theory states with masses given in the previous equation .",
    "the situation is not improved by consideration of excited string states in the bulk , for which one has similarly @xmath600 and @xmath601 an odd - looking scale .",
    "now , what changes when the d5- or ns5-brane charge is added ? for the d5-brane , essentially nothing happens to these arguments .",
    "this is despite the fact that a magnetic flux tube has formed , with a tension whose square root is given by eq .",
    "( [ coulombstates ] ) with the minus sign .",
    "presumably the details shifts around slightly , and of course the massless photons of the d3-branes now develop mass of order @xmath70 , but apparently the spectrum is otherwise little changed .    for the ns5-brane , the situation is more subtle .",
    "the electric flux tube has a tension whose square root is given , as in the d5 case by eq .",
    "( [ coulombstates ] ) , now with the plus sign .",
    "but in addition , unlike the d5-brane , the ns5-brane has a throat region .",
    "if we consider a vacuum with several coincident ns5-branes , then the throat region is reasonably well understood , since it can be described in conformal field theory in the region where the string coupling is small @xcite . from this",
    "it is known that supergravity states get string - scale masses from the coupling to the throat geometry .",
    "using the metric  ( [ nshell ] ) in the calculation  ( [ kmass ] ) gives @xmath602 this applies to both supergravity and excited string states .",
    "notice that this is the same scale as for supergravity states in the bulk , and for the string tension .",
    "unfortunately , the confining vacuum has only one ns5-brane , and there is a long - standing controversy over this object , reflecting the difficulty of doing any reliable calculations in its presence @xcite .",
    "there are disputes over whether the throat and its region of strong coupling even exist . in any case , neither supergravity nor conformal field theory is reliable , and we simply do not know what the spectrum will do in this regime .",
    "we note this may hint at a profound obstacle to using string theory as a practical computational tool in qcd .    in both the d5 and ns5 cases ,",
    "there is one more class of light states , arising from the massless gauge fields on the 5-brane .",
    "relative to the bulk states , the magnetic field on the d5-brane reduces the velocity of open string states by a factor of the dimensionless field , @xmath603 : restoring @xmath604 and @xmath605 to the brane action , one finds that the latter is multiplied by @xmath606 .",
    "the mass gap is reduced by the corresponding factor , and so is simply @xmath607 this agrees with the classical result , since these are the @xmath486 bosons and this is the scale of @xmath33 breaking . meanwhile",
    ", the ns5-brane has a normalizable zero mode @xcite , which gives rise to the massless vector required by @xmath84-duality to the d5-brane .",
    "we assume that this mode survives when d3-branes are dissolved in the ns5-brane .",
    "then @xmath608 and @xmath609 again we find a lighter branch of states localized at the brane . by analogy to the higgs vacuum , one might interpret them as massive magnetic gluons , but in the ns system they are not open strings but rather closed string states in localized wavefunctions on the throat .",
    "most of them carry @xmath295 quantum numbers and are therefore not seen in  yang - mills theory .",
    "some or all of the remainder may mix with bulk states , as we discuss below .    before doing so , we note that all of the masses we have obtained in the confining vacuum are consistent with t hooft scaling , as they are proportional to @xmath70 times a power of @xmath4 .",
    "this is pleasing , although it means of course that all of the states merge and mix as @xmath4 is taken small , making any quantitative computations in this regime essentially irrelevant for  yang - mills .",
    "let us note one important interplay between the open and closed string states",
    ". there would appear to be one unbroken @xmath19 gauge group per ( noncoincident ) brane , from the world - sheet gauge field on each brane .",
    "for an @xmath37 representation given by the sum of @xmath49 distinct irreducible blocks , @xmath33 is broken to @xmath48 .",

    "in fact , one @xmath19 should be lifted by the coupling to the bulk states .",
    "we have not understood all the details , but will indicate the ingredients .",

    "the actual story must be more complicated , with the bulk chern - simons term playing a role , because from the point of view of a single brane this would be simultaneous electric and magnetic higgsing , an impossibility .",
    "now we consider the general  case , three masses not necessarily equal .",
    "examination of the classical @xmath34-term equations  ( [ fterm ] ) suggest use of the coordinates @xmath616 we will study the potential with the ansatz that @xmath617 is constant and also that @xmath618 .",

    "the @xmath1 d3-branes are arranged in a line . from the classical equations , it is easy to see that an  breaking mass parameter for the vector multiplet causes this line to become a noncommutative ellipsoid analogous to the sphere of @xcite .",

    "the addition of a mass parameter breaking  supersymmetry to  engenders a transition whereby the @xmath1 handles join to form a single surface of genus zero : the line segment opens up into a closed curve . in m theory",
    "this is represented by a multigenus m5-brane making a transition to a genus zero m5-brane . here",
    "we see signs of a similar phenomenon ; the 3-branes which represent the moduli space of the  theory presumably align along a line segment , then join and expand to form an ns5-brane ellipsoid .",
    "by contrast , when @xmath626 with @xmath627 fixed , the ellipsoid becomes a disk while its overall size shrinks to zero . in the field theory ,",
    "one expects an infrared fixed point , and indeed the supergravity should go over smoothly to the kink solution of @xcite and at small @xmath99 to the ten - dimensional space of @xcite .",

    ".    it would be interesting to understand these connections in more detail , but we should note that our approximations will break down in these limits .",
    "we have seen that the 5-brane shell has a finite thickness , and we need this to be less than the shortest axis of the ellipsoid for our linearized approach to be consistent .",

    "this harmonic reduces the masses of some of the scalars , and if too large it can cause the gauge symmetry to break .",
    "however , it represents an adjustable parameter in the lagrangian , so we are completely free to choose it in such a way that it preserves a stable vacuum , assuming such a choice exists .",
    "further , if we maintain @xmath295 invariance , the choices are greatly reduced .",
    "since @xmath634 in the @xmath295-invariant supersymmetric case , and since the vacua in the supersymmetric case are stable , it is evident that for small @xmath635 the continued use of @xmath634 leads to stable vacua at nonzero @xmath319 .",
    "of course , the vacua need no longer be degenerate . whether the single ns5-brane is the preferred vacuum is less obvious , although it seems likely , since it is an extreme case among the vacua .",
    "in such a vacuum the spectrum would be altered and the stable domain walls would be lost , but most of the other features of the confining vacuum  flux tubes , baryon vertices , condensates and instantons  would be qualitatively unchanged .",
    "the new features would be the appearance of gluon condensates , such as @xmath636 , which must be zero in the supersymmetric case , and nontrivial dependence on the phase of @xmath635 .",
    "while the situation is less clear when @xmath637 , there are reasons to expect , on purely physical grounds , that a confining vacuum does in fact exist .",
    "it seems a worthwhile challenge to seek it in supergravity .",
    "many authors have studied supersymmetric and nonsupersymmetric orbifolds of the  yang - mills theory , its d3-brane representation and its supergravity dual .",
    "( a list of references may be found in @xcite . ) here we briefly consider two orbifolds of the results we have obtained above .    in the  theory ,",
    "a @xmath90 orbifold on four coordinates leaves an  @xmath638 theory with @xmath639 hypermultiplets .",
    "we can combine this action with the mass perturbation in two distinct ways .",
    "the first is a simultaneous rotation by @xmath640 in the 45- and 78-planes .",

    "since it differs from the first rotation by a @xmath642 rotation in the 78-plane , we can think of it as the first rotation times @xmath643 , with @xmath34 being spacetime fermion number .",
    "the first rotation commutes with the  supersymmetry generator , so the second anticommutes with it and leaves a nonsupersymmetric theory .",
    "note that the two rotations are conjugate to one another , and so in the absence of the mass term would give equivalent theories .",

    "the  superpotential is @xmath655 .",
    "the @xmath8 description of this theory is @xmath656 .",
    "there is a fixed plane at @xmath657 , which in the supergravity is @xmath658 where the second factor is a fixed @xmath659 on the @xmath6 .",
    "we may preserve supersymmetry and add the superpotential @xmath660 . in the gravity description , this is simply the perturbation we studied earlier . the low energy theory consists of two separate  yang - mills theories with no massless matter .",
    "there are two gluino bilinears operators , one even and one odd under the @xmath90 .",
    "the second rotation differs by @xmath643 , so the action on the bosons is the same : they are the same as for the theory  ( [ spectrum ] ) .",
    "the action on the fermions is opposite , so the fermionic partners are all absent , while fermions appear in all the blocks with 0 s .",
    "thus the low - energy field theory in this case is nonsupersymmetric @xmath661 gauge theory with a dirac fermion @xmath662 in the @xmath663 .",
    "this is a @xmath90 orbifold of  yang - mills @xcite .",
    "it has no fermion bilinear odd under the @xmath90 .",
    "note that for @xmath664 it is qcd with three massless quarks and with the vector @xmath20 of the flavor group gauged .",
    "this gauging removes all but a @xmath665 axial symmetry , or more generally a @xmath59 .    in both cases ,",

    "@xmath577 , with @xmath1 and @xmath666 fixed , the supersymmetric orbifold has @xmath667 vacua ; these confining vacua , in which the two gluino bilinears have separate condensates , should survive to the finite @xmath70 case .",
    "the presence of the massive matter in the bifundamental representation assures , however , that there is only one type of @xmath59 flux tube , and only one type of baryon vertex .",
    "only the condensates can distinguish vacua separated by @xmath1 consecutive domain walls .",
    "by contrast , the nonsupersymmetric orbifold has only one fermion bilinear , with a consequently unique expectation value .",
    "as we mentioned , there is an accidental @xmath59 axial symmetry in the limit @xmath577 , @xmath668 fixed _ if @xmath662 is held massless _",
    " more on this below . in this limit",
    "we expect the @xmath59 to be broken by a fermion bilinear ( note this is consistent with the dynamics of physical qcd ) so we expect @xmath1 confining vacua . again there is only one @xmath59 string and one baryon vertex .",
    "( in both theories we expect physical baryon states ; however they are rather similar in the two cases , differing in mass only slightly . )    on the string side of the duality , all of our brane configurations are invariant under @xmath90 and so survive in the orbifold theories .",
    "we do not see a mechanism for new phases to arise geometrically , so the extra vacua in the supersymmetric case are presumably associated with expectation values of fields in the twisted sector .",
    "certainly the difference of the gluino condensates ( and corresponding scalar operators ) is in the twisted sector , while the sum is discussed in section  v.f .",
    "the two supergravity orbifolds differ in the behavior of fermionic fields under the reflection , so that the spherical harmonics , and spectra , will be different in the two cases .",
    "the physics involving strings and baryons is essentially the same as before , but it would be interesting to understand how the domain walls are different .    the nonperturbative condensate in the unorbifolded theory survives , as a gluino bilinear expectation value , to small @xmath4 , where it can break the @xmath59 nonanomalous @xmath18-symmetry of  yang - mills .",
    "unfortunately we can not make the same claim for the condensate in the nonsupersymmetric orbifold .",
    "only if @xmath662 is massless for @xmath577 , @xmath1 and @xmath575 fixed , does the theory have a discrete axial symmetry , which can be broken by a @xmath669 condensate .",
    "however , while a gluino is always massless by supersymmetry , no such symmetry protects the fermion @xmath662 .",
    "we must therefore assume that @xmath662 can obtain a mass in perturbation theory through nonplanar graphs .",
    "fine tuning is required to obtain the axial symmetry and the massless fermion at small @xmath4 , and thus any connection between chiral symmetry breaking in qcd and the large-@xmath4 condensate is tenuous .    as an aside ,",
    "we emphasize the physical interest of these questions .",
    "nonsupersymmetric @xmath638 with a single massless bifundamental fermion , treated as a function of @xmath1 and the ratio of gauge couplings , is a very interesting theory worthy of further attention .",
    "first , if the gauge couplings are very different , the physics between the two strong coupling scales approximates physical qcd .",
    "second , the theory exhibits both confinement and chiral symmetry breaking , with the breaking of a discrete axial symmetry and interesting domain walls . as such",
    ", it closely resembles supersymmetric yang - mills theory .",
    "third , in contrast to yang - mills , the low - energy theory has only vector - like fermions and can be investigated with relative ease on the lattice . to our knowledge it has not been previously studied .",
    "of course , lattice studies of weakly broken  yang - mills are not impossible @xcite ; and one may hope , by comparing the @xmath638 theory with a massive bilinear fermion to broken  yang - mills , to study the extent to which nonperturbative physics survives orbifolding in the large @xmath1 limit . in short ,",
    "this theory is physically interesting , tractable on the lattice , qualitatively related to supersymmetric yang - mills theory even for small @xmath1 , and perhaps quantitatively related to it at large @xmath1 .",
    "as with all dualities , our work has implications in both directions  for supergravity and string theory , and for gauge theory .",
    "we have found one more example of a recurrent pattern , the resolution of a naked singularity by brane physics .",
    "earlier examples are the nonconformal d@xmath122 geometries @xcite , the coulomb branch singularities @xcite , and the enhancon @xcite .",
    "it is not clear how earlier work on the  theory is related to ours , because it was all in the context of five - dimensional supergravity .",
    "the solutions of ref .",
    "@xcite might lift to ours , but this requires that a great deal of physics , the entire brane configuration , be hidden in the ` consistent oxidation ' of the five - dimensional solution .",
    "we note that the solutions @xcite all have constant dilaton while our 5-branes will produce a locally varying dilaton even if not a dilaton monopole moment .",
    "as far as is known , the oxidation can not produce such an effect . in ref .",
    "@xcite a general criterion was proposed for identifying physically acceptable naked singularities .",
    "again this was expressed in terms of the five - dimensional theory and so can not be applied to our solutions without substantial additional work .",
    "there are a number of obvious loose ends in our work .",
    "we have not obtained the full supergravity background .",
    "we had the good fortune that we could obtain the relevant physics by working only to first order , and partly to second order , in the mass perturbation .",
    "it remains at least to solve the supergravity equations to second order .",
    "we have observed that the equations of the supergravity have many simplifications in our situation , but we have not understood their origin .",
    "it seems extremely likely that these will extend to the full second order calculation .",
    "it may even be possible , with the guidance from our approximate solution , to find the exact supergravity solutions .",
    "a related question is the analysis of the supersymmetry properties of our solutions , to establish why the supersymmetry is preserved .",
    "this involves the 5-brane world - volume as well as the bulk supergravity .",
    "we should remind the reader that we have not fully explained a key point , namely the fact that there are far more brane configurations than there are field theory vacua : many brane configurations represent the same vacuum .",
    "for example , we have not explained why the massive vacuum with a @xmath116 5-brane is the same as that with a @xmath670 5-brane ; we have merely shown that the question never arises purely within the supergravity regime . to understand the transition between these and other descriptions as @xmath88",
    "is varied remains an interesting challenge .",
    "a related issue is the minimum of the brane potential at @xmath318 .",
    "this is outside the range of validity of our approximation , but would naively correspond to an unexpanded brane and so a singular spacetime . since there exist expanded brane representations for all ground states , we presume that a correct interpretation involves transmutation into a different brane configuration .",
    "a complete accounting of these transitions is greatly to be desired .",
    "another related fact is that many brane configurations ( such as @xmath122 coincident d5-branes , @xmath671 ) represent multiple vacua , which are only split from one another by strong coupling @xmath672 physics that we can not see in supergravity because @xmath122 is small .",
    "this physics will have to be understood separately , and perhaps is only described by field theory .",
    "perturbed @xmath8 spacetime is relevant to the generation of hierarchies in randall - sundrum compactification  @xcite . in the latter paper",
    "it was argued that a large number of d3-branes localized in a compact space will generate an effective @xmath8 throat .",
    "that work was in the context of an  compactification and so the throat was stable : no relevant perturbation exists . the situation becomes more interesting in more realistic cases .",
    "if the d3-branes are localized on a space that leaves  unbroken , and the compactification is generic , the @xmath173 mode that we have considered will have a nonzero boundary value , proportional to @xmath70 , which is of order order one in four - dimensional planck units . since this is a relevant perturbation it becomes nonlinear essentially immediately , and the throat disappears . if for some reason the perturbation is anomalously small , then of course , as in any supersymmetric field theory , the ratio @xmath673 is quantum mechanically stable and the throat will be larger .",
    "our work shows that the incipient throat is capped by an expanded brane .",
    "it is also possible to avoid the instability using , for example , a discrete symmetry @xmath674",
    ".    it would be most interesting to study marginally relevant interactions .",
    "these may not exist in the  theory , but are present in various elaborations . on general grounds , not requiring supersymmetry , such perturbations would naturally become nonlinear only well down the @xmath8 throat , where again an expanded brane would presumably form . this behavior would bear some similarity to the hierarchy mechanism of ref .",
    "examples of such interactions were considered in @xcite , and there is strong reason to expect an expanded brane there as well .",
    "our work bears directly on recent proposals regarding the vanishing of the cosmological constant  @xcite , which involve a naked singularity in the compact dimensions .",
    "there have been many criticisms , published and unpublished , of the assumptions made in ref .",
    "@xcite regarding the properties of the singularity , but we can add to these the specific example of what string theory does in our case . in terms of our notation from section  iii.b , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite assume that the parameter @xmath138 can take arbitrary values .",
    "that is , they integrate in the coordinate @xmath99 , and assume that any singularity encountered gives an acceptable spacetime .",
    "further , they must assume that @xmath138 is a fixed parameter , rather than a dynamical quantity . as we see from our discussion ,",
    "this is inconsistent with the requirements of @xmath8/cft duality , and it is not what happens in our case : @xmath138 takes discrete values , depending on the particular vacuum , and can make dynamical transitions from one value to another .    thus the singularity in the end",
    "is replaced by an ordinary physical object , like a hydrogen atom . for hydrogen ,",
    "too , one can integrate the wave equation inward in @xmath99 for any energy , obtaining a generally singular solution .",
    "the experimental discreteness of the spectrum indicates that nature abhors a generic singularity .",
    "it is notable that our system has a large number of ground states , of order @xmath675 . in the supersymmetric case these",
    "are all degenerate , but once supersymmetry is weakly broken they will form a closely spaced , near - continuum of discrete states .",
    "if a singularity is of this type , the system may have vacua of exceedingly small cosmological constant , and the mechanism of @xcite may be realizable . in order for such a mechanism to solve the problem , these states must be sufficiently metastable , and there must be a dynamical mechanism to select a state with a small net cosmological constant ( the same problems are in any event present in the continuum case ) ; for further discussion of the latter issue see  @xcite .    finally , we should note that the myers dielectric effect will arise in many other situations , such as perturbations of other conformal and nonconformal theories .",
    "as one example , consider the perturbation of the bfss matrix theory given by the dimensional reduction of the  mass term .",
    "this has been used as a means of analyzing the structure of the matrix theory bound state  @xcite .",
    "now we see that this deformation has a physical interpretation in its own right : it is the matrix theory for m theory with a nontrivial boundary condition on the 4-form field strength . in this background",
    "the graviton will blow up into a finite - sized m2-brane sphere .",
    "this same mechanism , the myers expansion of a highly boosted graviton in a background field strength , has recently led to a remarkable explanation of the stringy exclusion principle @xcite .",
    "the brane solution gives a beautiful representation of a confining gauge theory and many of the associated phenomena .",
    "there are many artifacts of the massive  matter , so this is still far from qcd , but we emphasize that it is a confining four - dimensional gauge theory in its own right",
    ". we should perhaps note that we use the maldacena duality freely in the entire range @xmath676 .",
    "discussion often focuses on large @xmath1 with fixed @xmath4 , but this is only one part of the interesting range .    without too much additional work ,",
    "it should be possible to understand the breaking of  to  yang - mills .",
    "much of the moduli space , including the part corresponding to the repulson singularity studied in @xcite , should be visible in supergravity .",
    "we might hope that , as in @xcite , the seiberg - witten riemann surface will appear in a natural way .",
    "however , where the surface degenerates ( at points with light charged particles ) we expect there will be physics lying outside the supergravity regime . since the transition from  to  is described simply in mqcd , we may hope that this breakdown will be described simply using semiclassical branes , giving a picture of the physics studied in @xcite .",
    "we also expect a breakdown at argyres - douglas fixed points @xcite , where the physics , presumably a supergravity kink connecting one @xmath8 region to another , may not be described in a linear approximation .",
    "once the supersymmetric gravity background is completely understood , it should also be possible to fully explore the nonsupersymmetric case .",
    "since even the confining vacuum is a small perturbation of an  coulomb branch configuration , we do not believe that small breaking of supersymmetry is likely to have a large impact on the theory . new condensates and new @xmath158 dependence , and a loss of the degeneracy between vacua ,",
    "should certainly be seen , but otherwise we see no reason why the nonsupersymmetric confining vacuum must appear much different from the supersymmetric one .",
    "however , while this will be true if the supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath677 is small compared to @xmath70 , it will surely be false if @xmath678 . the quantitative question of where the transition lies , as a function of @xmath4 , remains to be explored . even assuming , however , that @xmath679 is within the supergravity regime",
    ", this does not make the study of pure nonsupersymmetric yang - mills any easier , since it is a long way from @xmath680 to the required regime .    assuming the nonsupersymmetric case",
    "can be studied to a degree , an obvious next step in studying the gravity  gauge theory correspondence is to add massless charged fermions",
    ". it would be most interesting to see chiral symmetry breaking and to determine if and when the properties of pions lie within the supergravity regime .",
    "adding supersymmetric charged matter is unfortunately not of great use , since @xmath33 with @xmath681 massless chiral multiplets in the fundamental plus antifundamental representation has no stable vacuum , while if @xmath682 there is as yet no dual string description .",
    "the low flavor case might be studied by taking type iib on an orientifold , which gives an  @xmath683 gauge theory with a hypermultiplet @xmath684 in the antisymmetric tensor representation and four @xmath685 in the fundamental representation @xcite . as in",
    ", the ultraviolet theory is finite , and could be perturbed by supersymmetric masses @xmath70 for the adjoint chiral multiplet and @xmath686 , and @xmath687 for the @xmath688 . when @xmath689 , the physics probably resembles , but the theory will exit the supergravity regime as any one of the @xmath687 go to zero .",
    "breaking the supersymmetry , leaving only the fermions in @xmath688 and the gauge bosons massless , would be a challenge , but might be tractable .    in this paper",
    "we have not pursued the obvious and important connections of our work with noncommutative field theory in two additional dimensions .",
    "similar relations are present already in mqcd .",
    "we are especially intrigued that the confining flux tube of large @xmath1 yang - mills is a nearly - bps instanton string of a sphere - compactified six - dimensional noncommutative gauge theory ( supersymmetric or not . )",
    "note that the baryon vertex is also an interesting object in this theory .",
    "the massive vacua with multiple coincident 5-branes , and their solitons , may be of considerable interest for the study of nonabelian noncommutative field theory .",
    "this may also be true for lower - dimensional cases , where the classical vacua are still described by spherical d(p+2 ) branes .",
    "it is important to note that many of our results bear some resemblance to those seen in mqcd , which is an unusual compactification of the @xmath690 theory on an m5-brane .",
    "both the breaking of  to yang - mills @xcite and the breaking of  to @xcite have been considered , although the full  model has not been constructed in mqcd .",
    "it is interesting to consider some of the similarities and differences with the supergravity dual of . in our picture , the vacuum is represented by an ns5/d3 hybrid ; in mqcd the vacuum is given by a multisheeted m5-brane , which , when the radius @xmath691 of the m - theory circle is small , is an ns5/d4 hybrid .",
    "second , the flux tubes in  are f1 strings bound to the ns5/d3 hybrid ; in mqcd they are m2-branes bound to the m5 brane .",
    "the baryon vertex in mqcd is an m2 brane which extends off of but has a boundary on the m5 brane , analogous to our d3 brane whose boundary is the ns5-brane two - sphere .",
    "domain walls are in both approaches are 5-branes mediating transitions between different 5-brane vacua .",
    "there are a number of important differences that this list understates ; but the most interesting difference , perhaps , is the instantons at large @xmath1 . as we have seen , the fractional instantons noted in @xcite are resummed at large @xmath4 into strings wrapping the ns5-brane two - sphere .",
    "all of these connections hint at the usual duality between m theory on a torus and type iib string theory , but the connection between the two pictures is not as simple as this , given the absence of a torus in both constructions",
    ". it would be interesting to make these connections precise .",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of the  theory , and any similar gravity dual of  broken to , is that it can be used to great effect to understand more deeply the connection of field theory with gravity and string theory . our work and that of @xcite points in this direction .",
    "the holomorphic properties of these field theories can be completely understood using field theory and/or m theory , as in @xcite , for all values of @xmath152 and all values of @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , one can distinguish clearly those regimes of parameter space in which the theory is well - described by electric variables , by magnetic variables , or by iib string variables respectively .",
    "the various universal and quasiuniversal physical properties of the theory are given different descriptions in each regime ( see for example our discussion of the instanton expansion of the superpotential , section  vi.g , ) and there are surely many things to be learned by studying how one regime converts to another . in particular , the possibility of _ quantitatively _ matching one regime to another deserves attention .",
    "it is probable that this will be required if one is to study qcd , which lies mostly outside the supergravity regime .",
    "if such matching is only possible for holomorphic and bps quantities , as so far seems likely , it poses yet another obstacle in the quest for a description of the strong interactions .",
    "however , even if the goal of doing calculations in large-@xmath1 qcd , using string variables , is shown to be unrealizable , the fact that field theories exhibit behavior which differs greatly from the physics we have observed so far in nature is of potentially great importance , in that it may open new avenues for solving old problems .",
