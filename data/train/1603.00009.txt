    "the main role of a vertex detector in ilc is to identify b - quark and c - quark from light quarks and gluones . in general , a b - jet has 2 vertices and c - jet has 3 vertices , while light quarks and gluones have 1 vertex .",
    "a vertex detector uses that information to identify quarks .",
    "since lifetime of b - quark and c - quark is very short with about 1 pico second , the requirement for the impact parameter resolution is @xmath1@xcite .",
    "the innermost layer is located at radius of 1.6 cm from the beamline for good impact parameter resolution , thus it is exposed to many @xmath2 backgrounds from beam - beam interaction . hit occupancy less than a few % is necessary for track reconstruction but it would be about 10 % using a vertex detector which has normal pixel size @xmath3 when it accumulates all the hits from one beam train .",
    "there are two solutions to get a low pixel occupancy .",
    "one is to read out many times in one beam train .",
    "its problem is a emi noise from beam .",
    "another is to use a small pixel size as @xmath4 and to read out during the train gap . in this way",
    ", there are no emi noise .",
    "the fine pixel ccd ( fpccd ) vertex detector adopts the second way@xcite .",
    "ccd is generally sensitive to radiation damage especially from heavy particles .",
    "since neutrons would come from beam dump in ilc , neutron tolerance should be checked .",
    "a neutron irradiation test was performed at cyric of tohoku university from 15th to 17th oct .",
    "the energy of neutron beam produced by 70 mev proton beam through a reaction of @xmath5 is about 65 mev .",
    "an fpccd prototype whose pixel size is @xmath6 was irradiated 2 hours and its fluence was @xmath7 . in ilc experiment neutron fluence is estimated at @xmath8@xcite thus the neutron fluence coresponds to 19 years of @xmath9 ilc beam time shared by two detectors .",
    "after the irradiation , the fpccd prototype was kept at room temperature to see its anealing effect .",
    "we have studied three parameters to measure the radiation tolerance of the fpccd .",
    "they are average dark charge of all pixels , hot pixel fraction and charge transfer inefficiency .",
    "these parameters are measured 3 , 9 , 23 and 199 days after irradiation to see annealing effect .",
    "status of these studies are reported in the following@xcite .",
    "the fpccd detects signal as electrons .",
    "however , electorns which come from thermal excitation are detected as dark charge even if there are no signal .",
    "therefore dark charge is accumulated proportional to exposure time of ccd .",
    "dark charge is measured with exposure time 5 , 10 , 30 and 60 second at -30 @xmath0c and -40 @xmath0c . before the irradiation ,",
    "dark charge is almost gaussian , but after the irradiation it has a tail .",
    "thus dark charge is measured using two methods .",
    "one is the peak position and another is the mean .",
    "the peak position is defined by the gaussian component and the mean includes tail effect .",
    "dark charge is proportional to exposure time thus it is fitted with linear function and its slope is dark current(fig.[figure1 ] ) .",
    "dark charge in 200ms , which is time of train gap , is estimated from dark current . before the irradiation , both indicators , the peak position and the mean , are almost zero .",
    "after the irradiation , the dark charge is larger still much smaller than signal charge .",
    "nevertheless , it is enough smaller than signal charge .",
    "annealing effect of the peak position is not seen . for the mean ,",
    "however , a small annealing effect is seen(fig.[figure2 ] ) . that indicates tail due to the irradiatioin became smaller .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "fpccd will be operated at -40 @xmath0c to improve radiation tolerance .",
    "however , space for cooling pipe and thermal insulator inside ild is very limited .",
    "two - phase cooling system uses the heat of vaporization to cool detectors which can cool detectors sufficiently thanks to the large latent heat of ( 300 @xmath10 ) in spite of the limited space .",
    "therefore two - phase is the most suitable choice .",
    "there are two options of cooling .",
    "one is a circulation using liquid pump and another is a circulation using a gas compressor .",
    "the latter is our r&d choice@xcite .    in this cooling plant , is circulated near room temperature and cooled by the heat exchanger on the detector side ( fig.[figure8 ] ) .",
    "thus a low temperature ( @xmath11c ) chiller and thermal insulator for the long transfer tube between the cooling plant and the detector are not necessary .",
    "cooling water supplied for the ilc experimental hall will be used for condensation instead of a chiller .",
    "a demerit of this system is need of heater to conpletely vaporize returning to gas conpressor .",
    "we have demonstrated the cooling between -40 @xmath0c to + 15 @xmath0c with a prototype cooling system using a gas compressor .",
    "the status of the r&d studies on the fpccd vertex detector for the ilc is reported .",
    "the neutron irradiation test was performed at cyric .",
    "an fpccd sensor was irradiated by neutron of @xmath7 in two hours , which corresponds to 19 years of ilc running at @xmath9 .",
    "dark current and hot pixel fraction get larger after the irradiation ; the increase , however , is small enough to be problematic .",
    "cti is also increased but it is acceptable level , as far as neutron background is concerned .    ladder design and assembly ideas are suggested .",
    "r&d has just begun .",
    "two - phase cooling system using gas compressor is found to be the most suitable choice for fpccd .",
    "a prototype demonstrated sufficient cooling between -40 @xmath0c to + 15 @xmath0c .",
