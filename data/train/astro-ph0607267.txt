    "1998 ) is strongly gravitationally lensed ( ledoux et al .  1998 ; ibata et al .",
    "1999 ; egami et al .",
    "2000 ) and appears to be one of the most luminous objects in the universe , with an apparent infrared luminosity of @xmath610@xmath10  l@xmath4 ( lewis et al .",
    "observations over a wide range of wavelengths ( e.g. , downes et al .  1999 ; ellison et al .  1999 ; gallagher et al .  2002 ; soifer et al .  2004 ; wagg et al .",
    "2005 ) have shown that apm08279 + 5255 contains an active nucleus and likely a starburst component .",
    "the combination of extreme intrinsic luminosity and amplification by strong gravitational lensing has allowed apm  08279 + 5255 to be detected in many rotational lines of co ( j=4 - 3 and j=9 - 8 downes et al .  1999 , hereafter d99 ; j=1 - 0 and j=2 - 1 papadopoulos et al .  2001 ; lewis et al .  2002 ) , including the unique detection in the high excitation j=11 - 10 line ( a. weiss et al . , in preparation ) . from high angular resolution observations ,",
    "d99 suggest that the high - j co emission arises in a warm , dense circumnuclear disk of sub - kiloparsec size .",
    "the detection of both hcn j=5 - 4 and hco@xmath11 j=5 - 4 line emission support the idea that the molecular gas is dense ( wagg et al .",
    "2005 ; garcia - burillo et al .",
    "2006 )    given the wealth of molecular lines detected in apm  08279 + 5255 , observations of additional diagnostic lines can provide further constraints on the physical conditions in this high - redshift object . one important tracer of the dense neutral gas within a galaxy s interstellar medium is atomic carbon , in particular the line with rest frequency 492.161  ghz ( grin & phillips 1998 , 2000 ) .",
    "this line has not been observed widely in local galaxies due to poor atmospheric transmission near this frequency ; however , this line is redshifted into better atmospheric windows for objects at redshifts , z  @xmath12  1 .",
    "the line provides a complimentary probe of the physical conditions of dense , neutral gas , and the [ ci]/co ratio may also provide information on the role of x - rays in the molecular excitation ( maloney et al .",
    "in addition , papadopoulos et al .",
    "( 2004a , b ) argue that this line can provide a measure of the total molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath13 ) gas mass , independent of co line emission .    to date",
    ", [ ci ] emission has been detected in four objects at z  @xmath14 , most of which are thought to be gravitationally lensed .",
    "the @xmath15p@xmath16p@xmath17 line was first detected in h1413 + 117 at z=2.6 ( the `` cloverleaf '' ; barvainis et al .",
    "1997 ) , and more recently the higher excitation @xmath15p@xmath18p@xmath19 line was also detected in this object ( weiss et al .",
    "other high - redshift objects with line detections include iras  f10214 at z=2.3 ( and an upper - limit on the line intensity is reported by papadopoulos 2005 ) , smm  j14011 + 0252 at z=2.6 ( weiss et al .",

    "2000 ; snell et al .",
    "2000 ) . at high - redshift , a tentative detection of the h@xmath13o  2@xmath202@xmath21 line , with rest frequency 752.033  ghz , was reported in iras  f10214 at z=2.3 ( encrenaz et al .",

    "the fundamental transition of ortho - water , has been detected in absorption towards b0218 + 357 at z=0.685 ( combes & wiklind 1997 ) .",
    "for apm  08279 + 5255 , the lower excitation line with rest frequency 556.936  ghz is redshifted into the 3  millimeter atmospheric window .    here",
    "we report a detection of line emission in apm  08279 + 5255 at z=3.91 , and an upper - limit on line emission , obtained with the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt a @xmath22-dominated cosmology : @xmath23  km  s@xmath1  mpc@xmath1 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 ( spergel et al .",
    "we used the iram pdbi to search for the and lines in apm  08279 + 5255 , redshifted to the 3-millimeter band , on six dates in 1999 and 2001 .",
    "all of the observations were made in compact configurations of the four or five available antennas .",
    "the receivers were tuned to 100.216 ghz for the [ ci ] line , and 113.406 ghz for the h@xmath13o line .",
    "spectral correlators covered a velocity range of @xmath61500  km  s@xmath1 for [ ci ] , and @xmath61300  km  s@xmath1 for h@xmath13o .",
    "the phase center was offset by @xmath26 from the co peak position in d99 .",
    "baseline lengths ranged from 17 to 81 meters , and the synthesized beam sizes were @xmath27 ( position angle 89@xmath28 ) for the [ ci ] image , and @xmath29 ( position angle 82@xmath28 ) for the h@xmath13o image .",
    "the nearby quasar 0749 + 540 was used for complex gain calibration .",
    "the flux scale was set using standard sources including mwc349 , crl618 , 3c345.3 and 0923 + 392 , and should be accurate to better than 20% .",
    "the on - source integration time for the [ ci ] and h@xmath13o images were equivalent to 7.3 hours and 3.1 hours , respectively , with the full six antenna array .",
    "the resulting [ ci ] image has an rms noise of 0.36  mjy  beam@xmath1 in a 150  km  s@xmath1 channel , and the h@xmath13o image has a higher rms noise of 0.96  mjy  beam@xmath1 in a 130  km  s@xmath1 channel , reflecting lower atmospheric transmission near the edge of the 3-millimeter window .",
    "figure  1 shows images of the [ ci ] line and continuum emission over the full velocity range observed .",
    "the line emission is clearly detected in several velocity bins and appears spatially unresolved .",
    "the position of peak emission is consistent with that found previously for the dust continuum , co lines , and hcn line .",
    "figure  2 shows the spectra of the [ ci ] and h@xmath13o lines at this position . there is no evidence for significant h@xmath13o line emission .",
    "for the [ ci ] spectrum , we estimate the continuum level at 100.2  ghz using the `` line - free '' channels to be @xmath30  mjy . for the h@xmath13o spectrum , we estimate the continuum level at 113.4  ghz using all of the channels to be @xmath31  mjy .",
    "these values are consistent with the 93.9 ghz continuum flux of @xmath32  mjy measured by d99 and a thermal spectrum .",
    "a gaussian fit to the continuum subtracted spectrum yields a peak of @xmath33  mjy , central velocity @xmath34  km  s@xmath1 ( z=@xmath35 ) , and @xmath36  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the integrated intensity of the line is @xmath37  jy  km  s@xmath1 , which implies a line luminosity @xmath0  k  km  s@xmath1  pc@xmath2 , following solomon et al .",
    "table  1 lists the fitted and derived line parameters .",
    "we place an upper limit on the line emission from the noise around the mean in the spectrum , assuming @xmath38 = 450  km  s@xmath1 like the co , hcn , and [ ci ] lines .",
    "the 3-@xmath9 upper limit to the integrated intensity is @xmath39  jy  km  s@xmath1 , which implies an upper limit to the h@xmath13o line luminosity @xmath8  k  km  s@xmath1  pc@xmath2 .",
    "the fitted [ ci ] line center and width are compatible with previous observations of the hcn j=5 - 4 and hco+ j=5 - 4 lines ( wagg et al .",
    "2005 ; garcia - burillo et al .",
    "2006 ) , though offset by @xmath40 km  s@xmath1 from the mean redshift determined from the high - j co lines ( d99 ; weiss et al .",
    "2006 , in preparation ) . while the line center difference between the [ ci ] and co is formally significant at the @xmath64@xmath9 level , the true significance is likely lower , since the line profiles from this complex source are almost certainly not described accurately by a single gaussian . given this uncertainty , the modest signal - to - noise ratios , and the lack of any resolved velocity structure in the observed line profiles , we simplify our analysis by assuming the [ ci ] emission region is cospatial with the co line emission region , such that the conditions derived for a model with a single physical component apply to both species .",
    "we stress that even if all of the observed lines do arise from a single physical component , the fitted gaussian centers and widths of lines with different excitation properties will not necessarily match each other perfectly , given the complexity of the underlying source structure and optical depth effects .",
    "data of higher quality and from more transitions will be required to relax the single component assumption and to justify more sophisticated modeling .",
    "the gas in the single component region is warm and dense , and is likely to be a circumnuclear disk of sub - kiloparsec size .",
    "the co emission clearly has been magnified by gravitational lensing , and models suggest a magnification factor in the range 3 to 20 ( d99 , lewis et al .",
    "2002 ) , or even higher in the models by egami et al .",
    "the exact magnification factor depends critically on the intrinsic size of the emitting region . if the [ ci ] , co , and hcn emission are truly co - spatial , however , then the magnification factors are the same , and line luminosity ratios will not suffer any biases due to differential lensing effects .",
    "the luminosity ratio between the [ ci ] and co lines is a potential diagnostic of the gas excitation and carbon chemistry . to compare the luminosities of [ ci ] and co in apm  08279 + 5255",
    ", we use the nuclear component of the co j=1 - 0 emission ( lewis et al .",
    "2002 ) , which gives @xmath41 } / l'_{\\rm co(1 - 0 ) } = 0.23\\pm0.06 $ ] .",
    "this value falls within the range @xmath42 found for local galaxies ( grin & phillips 2000 ) , and also the range @xmath6  0.15  -  0.32 for the other four high - redshift objects that have been detected in both [ ci ] and co emission .",
    "this ratio does not appear to have any strong dependence on environment , either in the local galaxy sample , or at high - redshifts .",
    "given the significant uncertainties in the [ ci]/co luminosity ratio for any individual object , it is not possible to place strong constraints on the contribution of x - ray irradiation to the molecular gas excitation .",
    "we can estimate the [ ci / co ] abundance ratio from the observations , adopting the physical conditions derived from multi - transition co observations ( wagg et al .",
    "2005 ; a. weiss et al . in preparation ) and a simple radiative transfer model . using the _ _ radex _ _ lvg code ( schier et al .",
    "2005 ) , we find that an abundance ratio , [ ci / co ]  @xmath6  0.6 , reproduces the observed to co j=1 - 0 line luminosity ratio .",
    "this ratio is similar to that found in the nearby starburst galaxy m82 ( [ ci / co ]  @xmath6  0.5 ; schilke et al .",
    "1993 , white et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the luminosity of the line can be used to derive the neutral carbon mass ( weiss et al .",
    "2005 ) , as @xmath43 } = 5.706 \\times 10^{-4 }              \\frac{q(t_{ex})}{3}e^{23.6/t_{ex}}l'_{[ci]}~[m_{\\odot}],\\ ] ] where @xmath44 ( @xmath45  k and @xmath46  k are the energies of the @xmath15p@xmath19 and @xmath15p@xmath13 levels above the ground state ) is the partition function .",
    "the only high - redshift object for which both the and lines have been measured is the `` cloverleaf '' quasar , where @xmath47  k ( weiss et al .",

    ", the value of @xmath48 is uncertain .",
    "however , weiss et al .",
    "( 2005 ) show that for @xmath49  k and lte , the estimated neutral carbon mass is insensitive to the assumed excitation temperature . adopting a nominal value of @xmath50  k for the line in apm  08279 + 5255 ( from the derived molecular gas and dust temperatures ) ,",
    "the neutral carbon mass within the nuclear region of apm  08279 + 5255 is @xmath51  m@xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the lensing magnification factor .",
    "if @xmath48 were @xmath52  k , then the estimated [ ci ] mass would be @xmath630% lower .",
    "the luminosity in the co j=1 - 0 line is the traditional tracer of molecular gas (= h@xmath13 ) mass in the galaxy and in a variety of extragalactic environments . for nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ;",
    "sanders et al .",
    "1988 ) , which are believed to be analogues to the currently detectable luminous high - redshift galaxies , the empirical scaling factor between co j=1 - 0 luminosity and h@xmath13 gas mass is @xmath61  m@xmath4  ( k  km  s@xmath1  pc@xmath2)@xmath1 ( downes & solomon 1998 ) .",
