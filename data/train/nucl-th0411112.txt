    "<S> the @xmath0-scaling method has been applied to the total multiplicity distribution of the relativistic ion collisions of p+p , c+c and pb+pb which were simulated by a monte carlo package , luciae 3.0 . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the @xmath0-scaling parameter decreases with the increasing of the system size . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the heat capacities of different mesons and baryons have been extracted from the event - by - event temperature fluctuation in the region of low transverse mass and they show the dropping trend with the increasing of impact parameter .    studying </S>",
    "<S> fluctuation and correlation is an important issue to investigate matter properties formed in relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions . </S>",
    "<S> some observables have been suggested to quantify the fluctuation , such as the balance function , net charge fluctuation , multiplicity fluctuation , transverse momentum fluctuation , particle ratio fluctuation and @xmath1 etc @xcite . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we will discuss some novel methods . </S>",
    "<S> we will apply a universal fluctuation method ( @xmath0-scaling ) which was recently proposed to explore the order - disorder phase transition in the low - intermediate energy heavy ion collisions @xcite to discuss multiplicity fluctuation in relativistic ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the heat capacity of hadrons are extracted from the event - by - event temperature fluctuation .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0-scaling is observed when two or more probability distributions @xmath2 $ ] of the stochastic observable @xmath3 collapse onto a single scaling curve @xmath4(z ) if a new scaling observable is defined by @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this curve is @xcite : @xmath6 =   \\phi ( z ) \\equiv \\phi [ \\frac{m - m^*}{\\langle m\\rangle^\\delta}]\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is a scaling parameter , @xmath7 is the most probable value of @xmath3 , and @xmath8 is the mean of @xmath3 . if we assume that @xmath2 $ ] is a gaussian distribution , we have @xmath9 = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi } } exp[-\\frac{1}{2 } ( \\frac{m-\\mu}{\\sigma})^2   ] $ ] , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the width of the gaussian distribution , both depending on incident energy . </S>",
    "<S> if this gaussian distribution @xmath2 $ ] obeys @xmath0-scaling law , we have @xmath12    in this work , p+p , c+c and pb+pb in sps energies ( 20 - 200 agev ) have been investigated with the help of luciae3.0 model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the head - on ( b=0fm ) collisions are simulated in this work . </S>",
    "<S> the luciae is an extension monte carlo model of the fritiof @xcite , in which a nucleus - nucleus collision is described as the independent sum of nucleon - nucleon collisions . for more details of luciae </S>",
    "<S> , please see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    -scaling parameter using the power - law fits to the relationship @xmath13 vs @xmath8 . from the left to right , it corresponds to p + p with @xmath0 = 1.35 , c + c with @xmath0 = 1.00 and pb+pb with @xmath0 = 0.80 . </S>",
    "<S> the circles are the calculated values and the lines represent the power - law fits . ]    in order to better investigate the @xmath0-scaling , we can use the power - law fit to the relationship between the rms width of the multiplicity distribution ( @xmath13 ) and the mean value of the multiplicity distribution ( @xmath8 ) according to eq.(1 ) . if there exists a good fit : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a fit parameter , indicating that a good @xmath0-scaling law is satisfied with a scaling parameter @xmath0 . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , we found that the best fit value of @xmath0 is 1.35 for p+p , 1.00 for c+c and 0.80 for pb + pb , respectively , which is shown in figure 1 . in the figure </S>",
    "<S> , each point represents an energy point from 20 agev to 200 agev with the interval of 20 agev . when @xmath0 = 1 , the rms width ( fluctuation ) is proportional to its mean value . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case of c+c system . for light system p+p , </S>",
    "<S> the rising of the rms width is faster than its mean value with the increasing of beam energy . in contrary , for heavier system </S>",
    "<S> , the growing of the rms width is slower than the mean value . in all three cases </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath0-value is larger than 1/2 , which is the case of the independent particle emission ( poisson distribution ) . </S>",
    "<S> the decreasing behaviour of @xmath0-value with the system size reflects how the multiplicity fluctuation grows with its mean value . </S>",
    "<S> its physics origin may stem from the stronger rescattering effect in larger system which induce some correlations in multiparticle production process and in consequence the fluctuation becomes weaken .    using these values of @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> the multiplicity distributions can be compressed onto a unique curve for a given collision system from 20 agev to 200 agev . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 shows the @xmath0-scaling curves for p+p , c+c and pb+pb systems with @xmath0 value of 1.35 , 1.00 and 0.80 , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> -scaling for p + p with @xmath0 = 1.35 , for c + c with @xmath0 = 1.00 and for pb+pb with @xmath0 = 0.80 for the different beam energies . ]    in relativistic collisions , the transverse mass ( @xmath16 ) distribution of the particles in lower @xmath16 region can be approximately described as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a normalized coefficient which is related to the volume / multiplicity term and @xmath19 is an apparent temperature . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the large enough particle multiplicity , it is possible to extract @xmath18 and @xmath19 for particles on event - by - event basis . in this way , the event - by - event temperature distribution can be constructed . </S>",
    "<S> usually , such kind of temperature distribution ( @xmath20 ) can be described by @xcite @xmath21,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the deviation ( @xmath23 ) of temperature from the mean value ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 can be explained as the heat capacity of a certain hadron . </S>",
    "<S> since the heat capacity is an extensive observable , we define a normalized heat capacity @xmath26 , i.e. the heat capacity per hadron multiplicity ( @xmath27 ) which corresponds to the energy that is required to go up one unit temperature for producing one particle .    </S>",
    "<S> the heat capacity of different particles ( in the range of @xmath28 gev ) has been extracted by eq.(3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the left panel of figure 3 shows an example of event - by - event temperature distribution of @xmath29 for the head - on pb+pb collisions at 160 agev . from this kind of distribution </S>",
    "<S> , we apply eq.(3 ) to extract the heat capacity @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the curve of the figure depicts this fit . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , we get the heat capacity for various hadrons in different energies . </S>",
    "<S> the middle panel of figure 3 gives the dependence of heat capacity of various particles ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , p and @xmath31 ) on incident energy in head - on pb+pb collision . from this figure , </S>",
    "<S> the normalized heat capacity of various particles decreases with the increasing of incident energy and tends to a saturation , indicating that less energy is needed to rise the same temperature in higher energies . in the viewpoint of fluctuation </S>",
    "<S> , this means that the increasing @xmath16 fluctuation at higher energies . </S>",
    "<S> the normalized heat capacity of the particles increases with mass of particle , which reflects that more energy is needed to rise the same temperature for heavier particles . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the impact parameter dependence of the heat capacity is also investigated for @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the right panel of figure 3 depicts the dependence of @xmath26 for @xmath29 on the impact parameter for pb + pb . </S>",
    "<S> the decreasing trend of @xmath26 indicates that the temperature fluctuation becomes larger in peripheral collisions , which is similar to the @xmath32 fluctuation or balance function as a function of centrality in star data @xcite .     in the head - on pb+pb collision at 160agev . </S>",
    "<S> the curve is a fit with eq.(3 ) ; ( b ) the normalized heat capacity of different mesons and baryons as a function of incident energy for the head - on pb + pb collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the lines represent the second polynomial fits to guide the eyes ; ( c ) the dependence of the normalized heat capacity of @xmath29 on impact parameter for 160 agev pb + pb collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the error bars are statistical . ]    in summary , we have demonstrated that there exists the @xmath0-scaling for the total multiplicity of charged particles for the simulated head - on collisions of p + p , c + c and pb + pb from @xmath33 = 20 to 200 agev in luciae model . </S>",
    "<S> that means that the multiplicity distributions obey a certain kind of universal laws , regardless of beam energies and collision systems . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the scaling value of the @xmath0 decreases with the system size , which reflects that the growth of the fluctuation with the multiplicity is faster in light system . </S>",
    "<S> the event - by - event thermal fluctuation in lower @xmath16 region is constructed and the normalized heat capacities of the different mesons and baryons are extracted . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the heat capacity per hadron decreases with the increasing incident energy and impact parameter , while it increases with mass of particle . </S>",
    "<S> considering that the luciae model is a string - hadronic model , the partonic effect which becomes more important in rhic energies is absent in the model . </S>",
    "<S> this effect should be investigated in near future . </S>",
    "<S> the work along this line is in progress .    </S>",
