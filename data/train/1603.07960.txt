    "the rare decays and the cp violation of the kaon have given us important constraints for new physics ( np ) since the standard model ( sm ) contributions are suppressed due to the flavor structure of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite .",
    "typical examples are the rare decay processes @xmath6 and @xmath15 , which are clean theoretically @xcite .",
    "these processes have been considered to be one of the powerful probes of np @xcite-@xcite . in order to improve the previous experimental measurements @xcite , new experiments are going on .",
    "one is the j - parc koto experiment , which is to measure the decay rate of @xmath6 approaching to the sm predicted precision @xcite .",
    "another one is the cern na62 experiment to observe the @xmath15 decay @xcite .",
    "especially , the @xmath6 process is the cp violating one and provides the direct measurement of the cp violating phase in the ckm matrix . on the other hand ,",
    "the indirect cp violating parameter @xmath3 , which is induced by the @xmath16 mixing , has given us the precise information of the cp violating phase of the ckm matrix .",
    "another cp violating parameter @xmath9 was measured in the @xmath17 decay .",
    "therefore , the @xmath6 process is expected to open the np window in the cp violation by combining with @xmath3 and @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath15 decays are dominated by the z - penguin process , which is the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) through loop diagrams .",
    "the z - penguin process also gives the large contribution to @xmath9 due to the enhancement of the @xmath18 amplitude @xcite .",
    "actually , it cancels the dominant qcd penguin contribution significantly in the sm since it has the opposite sign to the qcd penguin amplitude . on the other hand , @xmath3 is given by the box diagram .",
    "we expect the deviation from the sm prediction with correlating among @xmath6 , @xmath15 , @xmath3 and @xmath9 due to the np effect .",
    "furthermore , there may be other correlations of np with the kaon rare decay @xmath10 @xcite and the @xmath19 meson rare decays @xmath11 , @xmath12 , which have been observed in the lhcb and cms experiments @xcite since the z - penguin process also contributes to these processes .    in this work , we discuss the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) as the typical np .",
    "the recent searches for susy particles at the lhc give us important constraints .",
    "since the lower bounds of masses of the susy particles increase gradually , the gluino mass is supposed to be beyond the scale of @xmath20 tev @xcite .",
    "the susy models have been also seriously constrained by the higgs discovery , in which the higgs mass is @xmath5 gev  @xcite .",
    "these facts suggest a class of susy models with heavy sfermions .",
    "if the squark masses are expected to be @xmath21 tev , the lightest higgs mass can be pushed up to @xmath5 gev @xcite , whereas all susy particles can be out of the reach of the lhc experiment .",
    "therefore , the indirect search of the susy particles becomes important in the low energy flavor physics @xcite .",
    "we discuss the cp violation related phenomena such as @xmath6 , @xmath15 , @xmath3 and @xmath9 in the framework of the high - scale susy with @xmath21 tev .",
    "we can also consider the susy model with the split - family @xcite in which the third family of squarks / sleptons is heavy , @xmath21 tev , while the first and second ones of squarks / sleptons and the gauginos have relatively low masses @xmath22 tev .",
    "this model is motivated by the nambu - goldstone hypothesis for quarks and leptons in the first two generations @xcite .",
    "although there is no signals of the susy particles in the lhc experiment at present , this scenario is not conflict with the present bound of the susy particles .",
    "the split - family model is consistent with the @xmath5 gev higgs mass @xcite and the muon @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the stop mass with @xmath21 tev pushes up the lightest higgs mass to @xmath5 gev @xcite .",
    "the deviation from the sm prediction of the muon @xmath23 @xcite is explained by the slepton of the first and second family with the mass less than @xmath24 tev @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to examine the split - family model in the rare decays and the cp violation at the low energy @xcite as well as the direct search at lhc .",
    "for many years , the rare decays and the cp violation in the @xmath25 and @xmath19 mesons have been successfully understood within the framework of the sm , where the source of the cp violation is the kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) phase @xcite . on the other hand , there are new sources of the cp violation if the sm is extended to the susy model . for example , the soft squark mass matrices contain the cp violating phases , which contribute to fcnc with the cp violation @xcite .",
    "therefore , one expects to discover the susy contribution in the cp violating phenomena at the low energy .",
    "actually , we have found that the susy contribution could be up to @xmath26 in the observed @xmath3 , but , it is minor in the cp violation of the @xmath19 meson at the high - scale of @xmath27 tev @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have also found the sizable contribution of the high - scale susy to @xmath6 and @xmath15 in the non - minimal flavor violation ( non - mfv ) scenario @xcite .",
    "it is also important to take into account of @xmath9 because the sm has potential difficulties in describing the data for @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we study @xmath9 in the susy model with the non - mfv scenario .",
    "we discuss @xmath6 and @xmath15 with the cp violations , @xmath3 and @xmath9 in the framework of the susy at @xmath21 tev .",
    "in addition , we discuss the susy contribution to the decay processes @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    we have already presented the numerical predictions of the branching ratios @xmath6 and @xmath15 in ref.@xcite , where all squarks / sleptons and the gauginos are at @xmath21 tev .",
    "however , those numerical results should be revised with the ones of this paper since the relevant constraints are not imposed enough there . in this paper , we also reexamine them comprehensively by taking account of the gluino contribution as well as the chargino one with the large left - right mixing angle of squarks .",

    "the non - negligible susy contribution has been expected in @xmath3 even at the scale of @xmath37 tev @xcite .",

    "recently , the rbc - ukqcd lattice collaboration @xcite gives @xmath55 which predict @xmath56 in the sm @xcite .",
    "this sm prediction is much smaller than the experimental result @xcite @xmath57 this disagreement between the sm prediction and the experimental value may suggest np in the kaon system , however there are several open questions that have to be answered to conclude it @xcite .",

    "therefore , the chargino contribution to @xmath9 is opposite to @xmath6 . if the z - penguin mediated by the chargino enhances @xmath9 , the @xmath6 decay is suppressed considerably .",
    "on the other hand , the z - penguin amplitude mediated by the gluino gives the equal left - handed and right - handed z couplings .",
    "then , the right - handed z coupling of the z - penguin amplitude is by a factor of @xmath74 larger than the left - handed one .",
    "therefore , we can obtain the susy contribution which can enhance simultaneously @xmath9 and the branching ratio for @xmath6 .",

    "let us discuss the decay rates of @xmath6 and @xmath15 processes by choosing a sample of the mass spectrum in the high - scale susy model at @xmath21 tev .",
    "the enhancements of these kaon rare decays require the large left - right mixing with the large squark flavor mixing . in order to show our results clearly , we take a simple set - up for the high - scale susy model as follows :    * we fix the gluino , wino and bino masses @xmath109 with @xmath110 and tan@xmath111 as : @xmath112 for the high - scale susy . *",

    ", there is no strong constraint for the left - right mixing of the down squarks from the @xmath19 meson experiments in the region of @xmath21 tev .",
