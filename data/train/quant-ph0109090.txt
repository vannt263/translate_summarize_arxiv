    "there is now a huge interest in the novel optical properties of coherently - prepared atomic media , especially electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) where a resonant coupling field ( or pump field ) coherently prepares an atomic sample to allow dissipation - free propagation of a weak probe field accompanied by strong dispersion .",

    "harris and luo @xcite studied transient eit in the context of the energy required for the preparation of eit .",
    "li and xiao @xcite investigated the time required for the onset of eit and  zhu considered the conditions required for observing inversionless gain in the transient regime for the v @xcite and @xmath0 @xcite schemes .",
    "experimental work looking at dressed state transients includes phase shifting measurements in a two level system @xcite , fluorescence measurements on a three level @xmath0 system @xcite and pump - probe experiments on a three level ladder system @xcite .",

    "this is also the only previous experiment we know of which analyzed transient dynamics associated with the turn - off of the coupling field .",
    "rf experiments on the n - v centre of diamond appear in @xcite .  in our earlier work ,",
    "we have demonstrated transient eit @xcite and rabi oscillations and gain without inversion @xcite in a cold rubidium @xmath0 system after rapidly switching on a resonant coupling field .",
    "the work presented here differs from all previous studies in several ways .",
    "it extends previous work in transient eit by studying turn - on and turn - off transients , and  the region of parameter space investigated is much broader than previously studied .",
    "this is the only work we know of which studies turn - off transients for off - resonant probe and coupling fields , inversionless gain away from resonance and transient dressed state interference away from either bare or dressed state resonance .",
    "furthermore we present new analytical results to describe our experimental transients , derived using the laplace transform method , so extending the two level approach presented in @xcite .",
    "our theoretical results also generalize those of li and xiao @xcite for mutual resonance to include two - photon dephasing and arbitrary initial ground state populations , and we predict a new frequency of oscillation in the probe transient response .",
    "we also present an analytical solution , to first order in the probe strength , for the probe absorption when the coupling field is non - adiabatically turned off for arbitrary detunings of coupling and probe fields .",
    "our analysis is performed explicitly in the bare state basis .",
    "our results provide insight into how atomic systems become dressed by intense laser fields .",
    "a natural classification of eit response with switched fields is based on the relative time scales involved .  in the _",
    "adiabatic _ regime the switching is assumed to occur sufficiently slowly that the system evolves smoothly from one steady state to another .  for eit systems where the rabi frequency is comparable to the atomic lifetime , the switching is adiabatic when it occurs on a time scale that is long compared with the relevant optical pumping times .",
    "for example , steady state @xmath0-type eit with resonant fields is characterized by the ground state populations being in the non - absorbing superposition of the two ground states .  if the intensity ratio or relative phase of the two optical fields changes , then the composition of the non - absorbing superposition state changes , and so the populations have to be pumped into the new non - absorbing state to maintain transparency .",
    "thus the adiabatic condition requires the switching of the optical fields to be slow compared with the time taken for optical pumping from the absorbing state to the non - absorbing state .",
    "this is the regime used in the recent studies of optical information storage and retrieval @xcite , the single photon switch @xcite and its classical precursor @xcite .",
    "there is another adiabatic regime in pulsed systems where evolution occurs between ground states without spontaneous dissipation .  in the work by harris and luo @xcite on the conditions for preparing eit ,",
    "this was achieved by using extremely large rabi frequencies so that all system evolution to the dark state was achieved on timescales much shorter than the spontaneous emission time .",
    "not requiring such extreme rabi frequencies , adiabatic switching using the well - known stirap schemes @xcite decouples the evolution from the spontaneous emission , and so adiabatic evolution occurs on timescales independent of spontaneous emission time . the picosecond pulse experiment of nottleman _",
    "@xcite is also effectively in the adiabatic regime . in their experiment",
    "the relative phase of the two zeeman ground states oscillates by rf lamor precession in a magnetic field , and the probe pulses are timed to arrive at the particular times in the rf cycle when the ground states are in the non - absorbing state .",
    "we are not concerned with such regimes in this work .",
    "in this paper we are concerned with the _ non - adiabatic _ regime , where the switching time is very fast on the scale of optical pumping times , and all other relevant time scales , with the coupling field strength comparable to the spontaneous emission rate .",
    "the theoretical studies by li and xiao @xcite and zhu @xcite assume ( as we do ) instantaneous switching and are therefore in the non - adiabatic regime , as are the three experimental observations in @xmath0 systems @xcite where the coupling field was rapidly switched using a pockels cell .",

    "finally , fig .",
    "[ fig8](d ) is for a probe detuning of @xmath290 , again showing transient features between two regions of steady - state transparency .",
    "we have carried out a theoretical and experimental study of transient phenomena associated with the switching of the coupling field in a @xmath0 type eit system .",
    "these studies have shown novel transient gain features and aid the understanding of transient dressing .    we have experimentally observed interesting transient gain features in both the turn - on and turn - off regimes .",
    "we have found it useful to interpret the transient dynamics in terms of the filling and emptying of dressed states .",
    "the absolute peak gain values , especially the dressed state emptying , were found to be comparable in strength to the more usual , on - resonant turn - on case @xcite .",
    "off resonant gain peaks have an important advantage over resonant gain peaks in that they can be tuned by appropriate choice of coupling strengths and detunings .  in this way they can , for example , be removed from uncoupled absorptions or perhaps used to match transitions of different frequencies .",
    "the turn - off experiments also exhibited extremely clear transient signals and as such may be useful as a tool to explore the properties of atomic systems .",
    "we have obtained some new analytical results .",
    "in particular we give the weak probe response after turning off the coupling field for arbitrary detunings .",
    "analysis of the resonant turn - on using the laplace method enabled us to identify a frequency oscillation not reported previously .",
    "we analyzed this oscillation in terms of the 3d vector model and outlined a parameter regime where we would expect it to be observable .",
    "these results have applicability to the understanding of eit for quantum information storage and may lead the way to methods which avoid the limitations of the condition of adiabaticity inherent in present schemes for optical quantum information storage @xcite .    the authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the epsrc , as well as technical support from shahid hanif ( imperial college , london ) , roger bence , fraser robertson and robert seaton ( the open university , milton keynes ) .",
    "the oscillations in @xmath131 $ ] at the angular frequency @xmath53 noted in section  [ laplace ] are unusual in that the rabi frequency usually associated with the cycling of population is approximately @xmath152 .",
    "the origins of this effect in the absence of decay are easily demonstrated using the 3d vector model of 3-state systems introduced recently @xcite .",
    "the 3d vector model is based on the representation of the state of the atom @xmath291 by the real , 3-dimensional vector @xmath292 , where here the states @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath34 represent the bare energy eigenstates of the atom .",
    "the components of @xmath293 are given with respect to three orthogonal axes which we shall call the @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath294 axes .",
    "these axes represent the three energy eigenstates of the atom .",
    "the action of the ( resonant ) probe and coupling fields on @xmath295 is represented simply as a rotation about a _",
    "rabi vector _",
    "@xmath296 as follows : @xmath297 the rotation of @xmath293 about @xmath298 occurs at the frequency @xmath299 which is approximately @xmath152 for @xmath300 .",
    "the rabi vector lies in the @xmath301 plane at an angle of @xmath302 to the @xmath69 axis .",
    "the value of @xmath99 is the product of the amplitude of the state @xmath4 and the complex conjugate of the amplitude of state @xmath34 in @xmath303 , which corresponds to the product @xmath304 , and so @xmath305 .",
    "absorption of the probe occurs when @xmath306 and gain when @xmath307 .",
    "we note from eq .",
    "( [ eq : imrhobcasphis ] ) that , in general , @xmath235 has frequency components at both the @xmath308 and @xmath53 frequencies . however , there are two important cases where @xmath235 oscillates at either @xmath53 or @xmath308 .",
    "the first case is when @xmath309 . substituting this into eq .",
    "( [ eq : imrhobcasphis ] ) gives @xmath235 oscillating at a frequency of @xmath152 . in this case",
    "the initial state vector lies along the @xmath310 axis , that is , @xmath311 . in time",

    "equation  ( [ eq : imrhobcasphis ] ) was derived for zero ground state coherence , i.e. @xmath320 .",
    "this means that in the gas sample , half the atoms are in state @xmath3 and the remainder are in @xmath4 .",

    "( [ eq : imrhobcasphis ] ) .    in summary",
    ", we have traced the origin of the oscillations at twice the rabi frequency @xmath53 to the fact that for a pure state , @xmath99 is the product of the amplitude of finding the atom in state @xmath326 and the complex conjugate of the amplitude in state @xmath5 . in the absence of decay ,",
    "both amplitudes have terms that oscillate at the frequency @xmath152 , and so their product gives rise to a term oscillating at twice this frequency .",
    "so even though the populations oscillate at the rabi frequency @xmath152 , the absorption and emission of light has a term which occurs at twice this frequency .",
