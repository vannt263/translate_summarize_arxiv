    "is reduced due to improved methods of data assimilation , error in the model tendency plays an increasing role in the uncertainty of predictions at every temporal and physical scale @xcite .    in 1978 , leith introduced a statistical technique to correct model tendency error , in which short model forecasts are compared to a time series of reference `` truth '' to estimate both state - independent model bias , and state - dependent error components which are approximated by a least - squares linear function of the model state @xcite .",
    "more recently , empirical correction has been employed with success in atmospheric models with relatively few degrees of freedom ( e.g.  @xmath0 in @xcite ) , and low - dimensional modifications of the technique involving , for example , singular value decomposition ( svd ) of the state - dependent correction operator ( the least - squares linear function proposed by leith ) have proven successful in models with as many has @xmath1 degrees of freedom @xcite . in this study , we apply the original technique developed by leith to simple three - dimensional lorenz models @xcite , where in addition to testing the effectiveness of empirical correction , we aim to understand the dynamical ramifications of a statistical approach to the correction of model tendency error .    the model tendency @xmath2 is defined as the change in state variables over one timestep of numerical integration , which we denote as a time derivative : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the atmospheric state - vector , typically with @xmath5 degrees of freedom for nwp . note that @xmath6 represents the model state , whereas @xmath7 will represent the true system state , in terms of model variables .",
    "given the state @xmath4 of a physical system , @xmath8 consists of all the known physics , forcings , and parameterizations of sub grid - scale processes .",
    "to make a one - timestep model forecast , we approximate the true change in state variables over that time by the model tendency , @xmath9 , and the error @xmath10 in that approximation is called the _ tendency error _ : @xmath11    even with perfect estimates of the current state of the atmosphere , the model tendency error would quickly separate forecasts from the truth , due to the atmosphere s chaotic dynamics @xcite . as a result , techniques for reducing the model tendency error represent a current and active research area , and those that are applicable independent of the specific model are of special interest . clearly , one would like to improve the physics represented by @xmath8 from first principles . in what follows",
    ", we assume this improvement has met the limit of diminishing returns , and move towards a statistical approach .",
    "the general strategy of empirical correction is to compare short forecasts generated by a model to observations of the system being modeled over some training period .",
    "if the state - space of the system is well represented by the training period , and the model is a reasonable approximation of the true system , the forecast error statistics can be used to create an empirical correction that pushes the model closer to the truth _ at each timestep _ of numerical integration . adjusting the model",
    "every timestep reduces the nonlinear growth of tendency error , providing more effective error reduction than a posteriori statistical correction @xcite .",
    "this strategy is similar to nudging or newtonian relaxation in a data assimilation ( da ) context , where one is assimilating observations , except that here we are nudging with predicted , rather than observed , forecast error .",
    "the present study is an investigation of a three - step empirical correction procedure inspired by the work of leith @xcite , delsole and hou @xcite , and more recently danforth et .",
    "al .  @xcite .",
    "we first test its effectiveness in synchronizing lorenz systems @xcite with varied parameter - values in a perfect model scenario .",
    "we then apply the correction to an alternative model derived by ehrhard and mller @xcite tuned to approximate the evolution of a toroidal thermosyphon , an experimental analogue to the original lorenz system .",
    "the `` true '' climate is represented by a long - time , high - dimensional computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) simulation of the thermosyphon .",
    "an _ analysis _",
    ", which is an approximation of the true system state in terms of model variables , is then created by three - dimensional variational ( 3dvar ) data assimilation and used for training and verification of the empirical correction .",
    "this process mimics the application of empirical correction in an operational nwp setting .",
    "we also verify the corrected model by direct comparison with observations of the truth .",
    "the results in each experiment suggest that the correction procedure is effective for reducing error .",
    "however , there is an associated cost of this short - term error reduction , which is evidenced by substantial qualitative differences between the dynamics of the corrected model and the true system , differences that were not present in the uncorrected model .",
    "introduction of system - specific knowledge into the correction procedure is shown to mitigate some of that cost , while also improving error statistics further than the entirely general procedure .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",

    "finally , we discuss the results and conclude the paper in sec .",
    "the correction procedure employed in this experiment consists of three steps : ( a ) training , ( b ) state - independent correction and ( c ) state - dependent correction .",
    "the state - independent correction can be thought of as aligning the time - average of the model state with that of the true state .",
    "likewise , the state - dependent correction can be considered an alignment of the model variance with that of the truth . to determine the correction terms , we compare short model forecasts to observations of the true system over a training period in a process called",
    "_ direct insertion_.      in general , comparing model forecasts to a true physical system requires estimates of the true system state in terms of the model state - variables .",
    "consider a vector time - series @xmath12 of such estimates , which we will call the `` reference truth '' .",
    "the amount of time @xmath13 , measured in model timesteps , between estimates is called the _ analysis window _ ; we assume it to be constant .",
    "the process of direct insertion begins with the generation of a time - series @xmath14 of duration-@xmath13 model forecasts , where each forecast in the time - series is initialized from the previous state in the reference truth .",
    "the first vector in the series , for example , will be @xmath15 , which is the model state resulting from an @xmath13-timestep forecast started with initial condition @xmath16 . subtracting each of the model forecast states @xmath14 from the corresponding reference true state @xmath12 produces a third time - series @xmath17 which represents the forecast errors after @xmath13 timesteps .",
    "these errors result from differences between the model rate of change for each variable and the true rate of change , and they are commonly referred to as analysis corrections ( or increments ) .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : dirins ] for a schematic of the procedure .     represents a time series of the reference truth , and the analysis window represents the number of timesteps between estimations of the true system state .",

    "we turn our attention first to a state - independent correction of the form @xmath22 where the constant vector @xmath19 is the average model error ( bias ) to be determined .",
    "recall that our goal here is to empirically align the time - averages of the state - variables in the model to those of the true system .",
    "we call the time - averaged true system state the _ climatology _ , and we approximate it by @xmath23 , the average of the reference true state over the entire training period . the average of the analysis corrections @xmath24 over the training period provides an estimate for the systematic , state - independent error generated by the model during the analysis window , as explained in fig .",

    "we also wish to estimate any component of error that may depend on the system state , by approximating @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a matrix operator to be described in the next section .      to generate a linear state - dependent correction operator @xmath28 , we follow leith @xcite and delsole and hou @xcite , by first recomputing the forecast and correction time series in fig .  [",
    "fig : dirins ] using the state - independent corrected model , @xmath29 , and then decomposing into mean and anomalous components .",
    "we seek an improved model of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 includes both stages of correction .",
    "letting @xmath32 $ ] be the tendency error of the improved model , we minimize the expected square tendency error @xmath33 , ( where @xmath34 is the transpose of @xmath35 ) , with respect to * l*. the minimization results in the formula @xmath36 as explained by danforth et .",
    "@xmath37 is the average over the training sample of cross covariance matrices obtained by taking the outer product [ @xmath38\\cdot[\\mathbf{x}^{t'}(t)]^{tr}$ ] for each time @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 is the average true - state covariance matrix , and * l * is known as leith s state - dependent correction operator .",
    "when * l * operates on the current anomalous state @xmath41 , we can think of it as doing two things : ( 1 ) @xmath42 operates on @xmath41 , effectively relating the current state to the reference truth in the dependent sample , i.e. giving the best representation of the current state in terms of past states ; and then ( 2 ) @xmath37 operates on the result , determining what correction should be made .",
    "this allows the model correction to adjust to different regions of state - space , and explains why the state - dependent correction can be thought of as attempting to align the model and true - state variances .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the application of this three - stage procedure to align lorenz systems with different parameter values in a perfect model scenario , and in sec .",
    "[ tcm ] we describe its application to couple a low dimensional model to a high dimensional toy climate simulation .",
    "we also note here that the term _ corrected _ will imply the application of both state - independent and state - dependent correction , unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "as a first step in the investigation of the correction technique , we consider its application to a model originally studied by lorenz @xcite .",
    "the system of equations ( [ eq : lorenz ] ) represents fluid flow between two plates , rayleigh - bnard convection , in which convection cells form for certain parameter ranges .",

    "lorenz systems are covered exhaustively in publication @xcite , and thus provide a familiar platform on which to perform preliminary tests of strategies for predicting the future state of chaotic systems .      in this perfect model scenario ,",

    "stability of equilibrium solutions , and changes of flow regime characterized by aperiodic switching between otherwise confined regions of state - space are examples of qualitative characteristics for which it may be crucial that the model dynamics match those of the truth . in the next section",
    "we address the effect of empirical correction on the dynamical matching capability of the em forecast model .      to measure the accuracy of models with regard to matching the flow reversal behavior of the true system , forecasts were generated with both the corrected and uncorrected em models for 5000 initial states throughout the attractor , from the testing portion of the 90-day 3dvar analysis , and the time of the first predicted flow reversal",

    ", we make an observation about the relative impact of state - independent and state - dependent correction , in the present context , to conclude the paper .",
    "in the perfect model scenario , empirical correction of models with the greatest parameter error provided forecasts with smaller short - term average error , and that were useful for longer , than those made by the uncorrected models with least parameter error . similarly , empirically correcting the em model with 10% error in _",
    "every _ parameter ( measured from tuned values ) produced a forecast model that outperforms the tuned , but uncorrected model in predicting the cfd simulated thermosyphon . in each experiment ,",
    "superior performance is evident in terms of anomaly correlation and average forecast error , measured against 3dvar analysis , and is verified against observed mass flow - rate of the cfd simulation in the toy climate experiment .",
    "we do not present these results as evidence that empirical correction should replace parameter tuning , nor even that the former is better than the latter in any well - defined sense .",
    "however , the results do suggest that empirical correction could be a viable complement to the tuning of model parameters . particularly as degrees of freedom become large , for example @xmath145 in some currently operational numerical weather models , the computational cost of parameter tuning is very large in comparison to that of empirical correction , when appropriately modified for such models ( see @xcite ) .",
    "an example of such a modification is to compute the first @xmath146 principal components ( pcs ) of @xmath28 by singular value decomposition ( svd ) , where @xmath147 is determined so that a certain percentage of the state covariance is explained by these first @xmath147 pcs .",
    "a combined tuning / correction approach could reduce the number of model integrations necessary in the parameter tuning process without sacrificing model accuracy .",
    "however , the dynamical ramifications of this strategy must be considered , as we explain in the next section .      the reduction in average forecast error provided by empirical correction",
    "belies fundamental dynamical disturbances born out of the correction procedure .",
    "stabilization of equilibrium solutions , which results in large regions of initial states for which the corrected model forecasts behavior in opposition to that of the true system , follows from the dynamical modification imposed by empirical correction .",
    "in addition , the symmetry of the model system is broken by empirical correction .",
    "though these costs can be mitigated somewhat by hard - wiring system - specific dynamical cues into the correction procedure , they can not be eradicated without more fundamental alterations of the technique , e.g. , forcing the bias term @xmath19 and leith operator @xmath28 to preserve system symmetry . in operational practice",
    ", empirical correction is known to introduce imbalances , e.g. violating geostrophy , necessitating some mechanism for smoothing the flow into a physically viable region of state space .",
    "in fact , it may be impossible to avoid all dynamical inaccuracies resulting from empirical correction , and even if theoretically possible , it would likely be impractical to do so in any operational setting . in considering the application of the technique in operational settings , then ,",
    "it must be determined if the effects of misrepresented dynamics can be reduced to a tolerable level on a case - by - case basis . in the ideal situation ,",
    "regions of state - space that would be dynamically misrepresented under empirical correction could be reduced , by minor modifications to the correction procedure , to encompass only unrealistic or unlikely physical states . in any case , the technique presented in this study should not be applied without such considerations .      state - independent error correction by itself produces almost no improvement in any of the forecast models in this study ( not shown ) .",
    "this is in contrast to what has been observed in operational weather and climate model studies , where state - independent bias correction typically outperforms state - dependent correction in reduction of forecast errors @xcite .",
    "the inaccuracies of ad - hoc forcings included in such models to compensate for external and/or irresolvable phenomena ( e.g. solar and cloud forcings , respectively ) are likely responsible for a large component of the bias . in light of the lack , or at least minimal nature of such external and sub - gridscale influences in the toy models considered here ,",
    "the ineffectiveness of bias correction is logically consistent with this explanation .",
    "the state - dependent leith operator is entirely responsible for the success of the corrected models in this study . in the perfect model scenario",
    "this makes sense because the difference between the forecast models and the `` truth '' model are inherently multiplicative , i.e. the parameters are coefficients weighting the interaction between state - variable values and thus resulting errors _ must _ depend on state . for the em model of the cfd system",
    ", it seems that errors resulting from the low dimensionality of the forecast model may also be multiplicative in nature .",
    "if this is the case , state - dependent correction may reduce error patterns in operational models that result from reduced dimensionality , e.g. coarse resolution .",
    "the correction will not likely compensate for processes that are irresolvable due to coarse resolution , but rather may reduce the propagation of error resulting from the omission of such phenomena .",
    "this hypothesis is consistent with demonstrated improvement of local behavior in state - dependent corrected atmospheric models with @xmath148 degrees of freedom @xcite .    in previous studies of state - dependent correction in models",
    "that are much more realistic than those considered here , resulting error reduction has been minuscule in comparison to what is achieved by bias correction .",
    "however , this is not cause to reject the usefulness of parameterizing state - dependent error . though globally averaged error reduction may not be significant , improvement in the local behavior of models",
    "can have a large impact on forecast uncertainty , particularly in an ensemble strategy where state - dependent correction can increase the spread in previously unsampled state - space directions .",
