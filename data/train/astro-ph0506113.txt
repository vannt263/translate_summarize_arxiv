    "ddo 43 is part of a large survey of i m galaxies being conducted by hunter and elmegreen ( 2004 ) .",
    "the survey includes 140 i m , sm , and blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies , thus we can place ddo 43 in the context of a large sample .",
    "one of the purposes of the survey is to examine how star formation occurs and is regulated in low mass galaxies .",
    "the galaxies were chosen to be relatively nearby , and the sample was biased to those systems containing gas .",
    "all galaxies have been observed in h@xmath0  and ubv , and a sub - sample in jhk and h@xmath1i(neutral hydrogen ) .",
    "for those observed in h@xmath1i , we are examining the relationship between the stellar and gaseous components of galaxies in the sample . here",
    "we present the results for the i m galaxy ddo 43 .",
    "optically , ddo 43 shows no hint of being different from other tiny dwarf galaxies .",
    "it looks rather rectangular in v , as many i m galaxies do , and it contains numerous h@xmath1ii  regions . at a distance of 5.5 mpc ( determined from v@xmath8 given by de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 [ @xmath9rc3 ] and a hubble constant of 65 km s@xmath10  mpc@xmath10 ) , ddo 43 has an integrated m@xmath3 of @xmath414.0 .",
    "this places ddo 43 towards the faint end of the distribution of i m galaxies , but still well within normal bounds ( figure 3 of hunter 1997 ) .",
    "the oxygen abundance of ddo 43 was measured by hunter & hoffman ( 1999 ) to be @xmath11 .",
    "this value is typical of i m galaxies ( see figure 5 of hunter & hoffman ) .",
    "ddo 43 is relatively isolated .",
    "its nearest neighbor is another i m galaxy , ddo 46 , that is 270 kpc away .",
    "the nearest large galaxy is the sc spiral ngc 2537a 1.6 mpc away , including the radial difference .    despite its optical normality ,",
    "there were two possible characteristics of ddo 43 that led us to examine it in more detail .",
    "our discovery of a large ( galaxy - sized ) hole in the h@xmath1i  of the dwarf i m galaxy ddo 88 ( simpson , hunter , & knezek 2005 ) prompted us to further explore ddo 43 .",
    "both ddo 88 and ddo 43 were originally observed using the very large array ( vla ) while it was in its c configuration .",
    "although this produced data with fairly good resolution , these data suffered from low signal - to - noise , and only the highest density h@xmath1i  peaks in each galaxy were detected .",
    "for both ddo 88 and ddo 43 , these peaks appeared to form an incomplete shell around the optical body of the galaxy ( simpson & gottesman 2000 ) .",
    "intrigued by this , we obtained more sensitive h@xmath1i  data for both galaxies with the vla in both c and d - configuration .",
    "these deeper images of ddo 88 revealed an extensive h@xmath1i  envelope , and a high - density ring of h@xmath1isurrounding the bulk of the optical body ( simpson et al .",
    "the inner part of the ring is h@xmath1i - deficient , and the size of the hole is comparable to the optical galaxy . there is a faint , very red cluster located approximately in the center of the hole that may be the remnant of the star - formation event that produced the h@xmath1i  hole .",
    "previous work suggests that feedback between energy deposited in the interstellar medium ( ism ) by massive star formation and the ism itself may regulate star formation in low mass dwarf galaxies .",
    "they do not possess the gravitational potentials necessary to support spiral density waves , which regulate star formation in larger galaxies , so some other mechanism must be operating .",
    "observations of dirrs have revealed highly structured h@xmath1i  morphologies , with holes , shells , and filaments apparent ( e.g.  ott et al .",
    "2001 ; stewart et al .",
    "2000 ; walter & brinks 1999 ; martin 1998 ; meurer et al .",
    "1998 ; young & lo 1996 ; meurer et al .  1992 ; puche et al .  1992 ; but see rhode et al .  1999 ) . presumably , these features are both the result and cause of episodes of star formation : energy and stellar winds from massive stars sweeps up the surrounding h@xmath1i producing cavities in the gas ( e.g.  scalo & chappell 1999 ) . denser regions of gas pile up along the boundaries , creating h@xmath1ishells and filaments . where the gas becomes dense enough",
    ", further star formation can occur .",
    "the detection of an old , red cluster in the center of the large h@xmath1ihole in ddo 88 , along with the location of younger clusters in the higher density shell around the hole , is in agreement with this star formation scenario .",
    "these interesting results from our study of ddo 88 led us to examine ddo 43 to see if it also contained a large h@xmath1i  hole , as hinted at by the earlier vla observations .",
    "ddo 43 is relatively similar to ddo 88 in many physical respects ; has star formation had the same sort of effect on it as in ddo 88 ?",
    "ddo 43 also interested us because it is listed by hunter , hunsberger , & roye ( 2000 ) as a candidate old tidal dwarf galaxy .",
    "people have recently recognized that dwarf irregular ( i m ) galaxies can form in the tidal tails of merging spiral galaxies ( mirabel , dottori , & lutz 1992 ; malphrus et al .  1997 ; duc & mirabel 1999 ) .",
    "some dwarf systems are forming this way now ( hunsberger , charlton , & zaritsky 1996 ) while others may have formed in interactions long ago that are no longer obvious .",
    "a distinctive characteristic of tidal dwarfs is that they should have less dark matter than traditional dwarfs ( barnes & hernquist 1992 ) .",
    "hunter et al .  exploited this property to identify candidate old tidal dwarf systems among nearby i m galaxies . ddo 43 potentially has a maximum rotation speed that is too low for its luminosity ( simpson & gottesman 2000 ; figure 1 of hunter et al .",
    "if borne out , this could indicate a deficit of dark matter and make ddo 43 a strong candidate for a tidal dwarf .",
    "we used the hall 1.1 m telescope at lowell observatory to obtain b and v images of ddo 43 1999 february and u images 1999 november .",
    "we used a site 2048@xmath122048 ccd binned @xmath13 .",
    "the exposure times were @xmath14 s for v , @xmath15 s for b , and @xmath16 s for u. the pixel scale was 1.13 , and the seeing in the final averaged images was 2.9  in v , 2.3  in b , and 2.6  in u. the electronic pedestal was subtracted using the overscan strip , and the images were flat - fielded using sky flats .",
    "landolt ( 1992 ) standard stars were used to calibrate the photometry .",
    "the images in each filter were averaged with an algorithm to reject cosmic rays while still preserving the photometric integrity of the image .    before performing surface photometry , we edited foreground stars and background galaxies from the final ubv images .",
    "the v - band image was done by hand , and then the cursor log file produced from that was used to remove objects from the other two filters . in that way",
    ", stars were removed in the same way for each filter .",
    "we then made a two - dimensional fit to the background and subtracted it from the image to produce a sky - subtracted final image for analysis .",
    "we obtained h@xmath0  images of ddo 43 in 1995 february with the perkins 1.8 m telescope at lowell observatory .",
    "we used a ti @xmath17 ccd provided to lowell observatory by the national science foundation and the ohio state university fabry - perot as a 3:1 focal reducer .",
    "the h@xmath0filter has a central wavelength of 6566   and a fwhm of 32  .",
    "the contribution from stellar continuum was determined using an off - band filter centered at 6440   with a fwhm of 95  .",
    "the off - band image was shifted , scaled , and subtracted from the h@xmath0  image to remove the stellar continuum and leave only h@xmath0  nebular emission .",
    "the h@xmath0observations consisted of three 3000 s images , preceeded by a 900 s off - band observation .",
    "the pixel scale was 0.49 , and the stellar fwhm on the final image is 1.6 .",
    "the electronic pedestal was subtracted using the overscan strip , and the images were flat - fielded using observations of a white spot hanging on the inside of the dome .",
    "the h@xmath0  flux was calibrated using observations of the ngc 2363 nebula ( kennicutt , balick , & heckman 1980 ) .",
    "the h@xmath0  flux has been corrected for the shift of the bandpass with temperature and for contamination by the [ nii]@xmath186584 emission line in the bandpass ( a 1% correction ) .",
    "21 cm spectral line observations of ddo 43 were made using both the d and c configurations of the vla .",
    "time on source for both observations was approximately 4.5 hours .",
    "the d configuration , which is the vla s most compact , provides short spacings , resulting in high sensitivity but at the cost of spatial resolution : the synthesized beam is on the order of 1 .",
    "the c configuration , with longer baselines , provides higher resolution ( nominally 12.5 ) but lower sensitivity .",
    "observations for both configurations were made using a 128 channel spectrometer in 2if mode with on - line hanning smoothing .",
    "this results in a channel separation of 12.2 khz ( 2.6 km s@xmath10 ) for a total observed bandwidth of 1.56 mhz . for spectral line data that are taken using on - line hanning smoothing ,",
    "the velocity resolution is equal to the channel separation , and so is also 2.6 km s@xmath10",
    ".    observations of the nearby continuum source 0713 + 438 ( j2000 ) were made for phase calibration of both data sets ; observations of the sources 0137 + 331 ( j2000 ) and 1331 + 305 ( j2000 ) were made for calibration of the flux and bandpass of the c and d - configuration data , respectively .",
    "calibration of both data sets was performed using the standard routines in aips .",
    "observational information is provided in table  [ tab : hi ] .",
    "the d - configuration source data were affected by solar contamination on the short baselines .",
    "the corrupted data were flagged , removing approximately 8% of the total number of visibilities .",
    "there were three strong continuum sources in the field ; there was no sign of continuum emission from ddo 43 .",
    "the continuum was satisfactorily subtracted in the _ uv _ plane by using line - free channels to make a linear fit to the continuum emission .",
    "the resulting continuum - free data was then imaged using the aips task imagr . to ensure the best sensitivity to low levels of emission ,",
    "natural weighting was used .",
    "the data were cleaned during imaging to reduce the sidelobes produced by non - gaussian features in the `` dirty '' beam .",
    "no clean boxes were specified , so the default of a box ten pixels smaller than the image size was used .",
    "no zero - spacing flux was assumed .",
    "the specified flux cutoff of 0.83 mjy / b ( @xmath19 in a single channel ) was reached in less than 3000 iterations in each channel , which is less than the 10,000 iteration cutoff set in the task .",
    "the resulting data cube ( one channel for each observed frequency ) has a beam size of @xmath20  and a single channel r.m.s .  of 0.81 mjy / b .",
    "line emission appears from approximately 300420 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the data cube was integrated in velocity with the task momnt to produce moment maps of the integrated flux density , the flux - weighted velocity field , and the velocity dispersions .",
    "the integration task first smooths the data spatially and then in velocity space to create a lower - noise mask .",
    "a cutoff of approximately 1.5 times the single - channel r.m.s .  was applied to the mask , and pixels in the original , unsmoothed cube corresponding to the mask pixels higher than the cutoff flux were integrated .",
    "the c - configuration data were very well behaved resulting in minimal data editing .",
    "no solar contamination was present , but like the d configuration , there were still the three strong continuum sources .",
    "this continuum emission was subtracted as for the d - configuration data .",
    "the imaging was done using uniform weighting ( robust = 1 ) however , to produce high resolution images with only a slight degredation in sensitivity .",
    "this resulted in a beam size of @xmath21  and a single - channel r.m.s .  of 1.05 mjy / b .",
    "as for the d - configuration data , the data were cleaned during imaging . in this case , a test showed that the clean component flux leveled off after the first 500 iterations , and so an iteration cutoff of 2500 was used in conjunction with a flux cutoff of 0.6 mjy / b ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the same defaults of no zero - spacing flux and no specified clean boxes were used . after imaging ,",
    "the cube was integrated in velocity using a flux cutoff of @xmath23 to produce moment maps as was done for the d - configuration data .",
    "once the c and d - configuration data were calibrated , they were combined in the _ uv _ plane to produce a data set with both good resolution and sensitivity .",
    "this combined c@xmath24d  dataset was imaged using both natural ( c@xmath24d@xmath25 ) and uniform ( c@xmath24d@xmath26 ; robust = 1 ) weighting .",
    "the naturally - weighted data cube has a beam size of @xmath27 and a single - channel r.m.s .  of 1.05 mjy / b .",
    "the uniformly - weighted cube has a beam size of @xmath28 and a single - channel r.m.s .  of 1.07 mjy / b ( see table [ tab : hi ] ) .",
    "as for the c configuration data , an iteration cutoff of 2500 was determined to be adequate , and was combined with a flux cutoff of 0.6 mjy / b ( @xmath29 ) for the uniform weighted data . for the naturally weighted data ,",
    "the interation limit was set to 3500 .",
    "no clean boxes or zero - spacing flux were specified .    in figure",
    "[ fig : single ] we show the velocity profiles from our c@xmath24d - configuration data ( natural weighting ) and from single - dish data from the effelsberg 100 m radio telescope ( huchtmeier & richter 1986 ) . from our d - configuration data , we find an integrated source flux of 12.9 jy km s@xmath10 , which is similar to three of the four single - dish flux measurements listed in the huchtmeier & richter catalog ( 1989 ) .",
    "the fourth measurement , the one from the effelsberg 100 m radio telescope , is quite a bit higher at 16.9 jy km s@xmath10 .",
    "the effelsberg beam at 21 cm is 9 ; a search within a 9  radius of ddo 43 using ned turned up only a few continuum sources , so it is unlikely that this discrepancy in the measured flux is caused by confusion in the effelsberg beam .",
    "if the effelsberg flux is correct , we have only recovered 76% of the h@xmath1i  flux .",
    "we have checked our flux calibration by comparing the catalogued flux densities of two ( unresolved ) continuum sources in the field with the fluxes measured from our data .",
    "these sources are within 34  of ddo 43 ; they are catalogued in the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; condon et al .",
    "1998 ) . in the c - configuration data , our measured fluxes ( 44.6 and 94.1 mjy )",
    "are an average of 7% lower than the nvss values of 48.9 and 97.9 mjy ; for the d - configuration ( 42.4 and 88.6 mjy ) they are 12% lower .",
    "if we assume this is accurate and correct our integrated flux for ddo 43 by 12% for the d - configuration data , we are still only detecting 85% of the reported effelsberg value .",
    "another possibility is that the vla interferometer is missing some of the flux detected by the effelsberg single - dish instrument .",
    "interferometers are `` blind '' to structures larger than an angular size that depends on the projected baseline lengths between the antennas .",
    "the d configuration can detect structures up to 15  across per spectral channel before they are resolved out by the interferometer .",
    "if the discrepancy is due to a low - level envelope too large to be detected by the vla , it would have to be approximately twice the extent of the h@xmath1ithat we detected ( see  [ sec : radio ] below ) .",
    "this seems unlikely , as does missing faint emission with our sensitive observations .",
    "as our estimate agrees with the other three catalogued measurements , it would seem that the effelsberg value is suspect .",
    "the logarithm of our v - band image of ddo 43 is shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : v ] .",
    "the most striking feature of the image is the rather rectangular morphology of the middle isophotes .",
    "this morphology resembles , for example , that of the i m galaxies ddo 75 , ngc 1156 , ngc 2366 , and ngc 4449 .",
    "this shape suggests the presence of a stellar bar potential .",
    "the identification of bars in i m galaxies is complicated by the lack of symmetry provided by spiral arms and is especially difficult if the bar is comparable in size to the galaxy ( roye & hunter 2000 ) . however , there are some properties that can offer additional evidence that a bar is present .",
    "first , we fit the rectangular part of the v - band isophotes with a curve of the form @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the semi - major and minor axes and @xmath33 is a parameter that describes the boxiness of the bar structure ( athanassoula et al.1990 ) . for @xmath34",
    "the structure is an ellipse , for @xmath35 the structure is `` disky , '' and for @xmath36 the structure is `` boxy . ''",
    "the best fit for ddo 43 is a curve with @xmath37 , a boxy structure centered at 7@xmath38 28@xmath39 17.55@xmath40 , 40  46  09.8  ( j2000 ) with a bar semi - major axis @xmath41 of 33  at a position angle of 20 .",
    "this curve is shown in figure [ fig : v ] superposed on the logarithm of the v - band image .",
    "the i m galaxies ngc 2366 and ngc 4449 are also best fit with a @xmath37 boxy curve ( hunter , elmegreen , & van woerden 2001 ; hunter , van woerden , & gallagher 1999 ) . fitting a boxy elliptical",
    "does not require that a bar be present ( see discussion of ngc 2366 , hunter et al .",
    "2001 ) , but it does suggest that one could be present",
    ".    a second observational clue to the presence of a bar can be the twisting of isophotes as one goes from the bar to the disk .",
    "this is clearly seen in ngc 4449 , for example ( hunter et al .",
    "1999 ) , but is not a necessary condition . in ddo 43 there is a small shift in the position angle of the major axis as one goes from the inner isophotes fit with the boxy curve ( @xmath42 mag arcsec@xmath43 ) to outer isophotes . the inner rectangle is best fit with a boxy curve with a position angle of 20  while the outer isophotes have a position angle of 6.5 .",
    "this is a shift of 13.5  and it is clearly visible in figure [ fig : v ] .",
    "a third characteristic of a bar is a potential mis - alignment between the kinematic line of nodes and the major axis of the bar . in a barred galaxy ,",
    "the isophotes are not circular in the principal plane , and the stellar orbits may precess , so the line of nodes and morphological axis need not be aligned .",
    "this is the case in , for example , ngc 1156 ( hunter et al .",
    "we will discuss the gas kinematics in ddo 43 below , but it is appropriate to mention here that the position angle of the line of nodes of the rotating gas system is 294 .",
    "thus , the kinematic line of nodes and the major axis of the rectangular part of the galaxy are nearly perpendicular , being mis - aligned by 86 .",
    "this is strong evidence that the boxy appearance of the optical galaxy is in fact due to a stellar bar potential .",
    "however , if ddo 43 is barred , the bar occupies a large fraction of the optical galaxy .",
    "this is also the case in ngc 1156 , ngc 2366 , and ngc 4449 . in ddo 43",
    "@xmath41/r@xmath2 is 0.8 ; where r@xmath2 is the radius at a @xmath44 of 25 magnitudes per arcsec@xmath43 . in ngc 2366",
    "this ratio is 1.6 and in ngc 4449 it is 0.6 .",
    "by contrast , in sd ",
    "sm spiral galaxies @xmath41/r@xmath2 is 0.050.3 ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1985 , martin 1995 , elmegreen et al .",
    "thus , ddo 43 and other barred i m galaxies are unusual in being dominated optically by the bar if it is present .    in figure",
    "[ fig : barcuts ] we show surface brightness cuts in v along the major and minor axis of the bar .",
    "the cuts are 20  wide .",
    "the cuts from ddo 43 are more rounded at the top than cuts across the bar of ngc 4449 , but resemble similar cuts made in ngc 2366 .",
    "the surface brightness of bars in late - type spirals are more often fit with an exponential whereas those in early - type spirals are flatter ( combes & elmegreen 1993 , elmegreen et al .",
    "the profiles of ddo 43 resemble those of a few scd  sm galaxies with exponential profiles shown by elmegreen et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "we present ubv surface photometry in figure [ fig : ubv ] . to measure the surface photometry we used ellipses with a position angle of 6.5 , a ratio of minor to major axis ratio @xmath45 of 0.70 , and a semi - major axis step size of 11.3 .",
    "the @xmath45 , position angle , and center were determined from an outer isophote on a @xmath13 block - averaged version of the v - band image .",
    "the surface photometry and colors have been corrected for reddening using a total e(b@xmath4v)@xmath46=e(b@xmath4v)@xmath47@xmath240.05 , where the foreground reddening e(b@xmath4v)@xmath47 is 0.055 ( burstein & heiles 1984 ) and we add 0.05 for nominal internal reddening .",

    "ddo 43 is fit well with an exponential disk profile having a central surface brightness @xmath53 of 22.4@xmath540.2 magnitudes of one arcsec@xmath43 and a disk scale length r@xmath55 of 430@xmath5450 pc .",
    "both these values are normal for i m galaxies ( hunter & elmegreen 2004 , de jong 1996 ) .",

    "two - dimensional color ratio images further substantiate that there is no large - scale pattern to the colors .",
    "we show our h@xmath0  image of ddo 43 in the right panel of figure [ fig : v ] .",
    "there one can see that ddo 43 contains numerous h@xmath1ii  regions scattered across the disk of the galaxy .",
    "the most distant h@xmath1ii  region from the center of the galaxy is found in the northern part of the galaxy just beyond the holmberg radius at 1.5 kpc , which is not unusual ( see figure 15 of hunter & elmegreen 2004 ) .",
    "the largest h@xmath1ii  region , in the eastern part of the galaxy , has an h@xmath0  luminosity of @xmath56 ergs s@xmath10 , which is equivalent to 10 orion nebulae ( kennicutt 1984 ) .",

    "the v - band surface photometry and h@xmath0  surface photometry are displayed so that they cover the same logarithmic interval and , thus , the slopes of the profiles can be directly compared .",
    "we see that , although star formation is found in the center of the galaxy , the surface density is less than would be expected . as a result , there is a depression in the star formation activity in the central 0.75 kpc of the galaxy .",
    "beyond there the star formation activity drops off in step with the drop in stellar surface density , as is common in i m galaxies ( hunter , elmegreen , & baker 1998 , hunter & elmegreen 2004 ) .",
    "the h@xmath0  luminosity and derived star formation rate of the galaxy are given in table [ tab : int ] .",
    "ddo 43 has a star formation rate per unit area that is in the middle of the range seen in i m galaxies ( see figure 9 of hunter & elmegreen 2004 ) . at its current rate of consumption ,",
    "the galaxy can turn gas into stars for another 25 gyr if all of the gas associated with the galaxy can be used .",
    "the timescale to run out of gas is even longer if recycling of gas from dying stars is efficient .",
    "this timescale to exhaust the gas is typical of i m galaxies ( hunter & elmegreen 2004 ) , and the galaxy can continue forming stars at its current rate for several more hubble times .",
    "the v - band image of ddo 43 clearly shows knots that appear to be star clusters .",
    "these are numbered in figure [ fig : v ] .",
    "we measured the ubv photometry of these clusters through apertures that just included the cluster as seen on the v - band image , radii of 1.7  to 4.0 . to determine the contribution to the signal from the underlying galaxy , we used an annulus 4.06.2 .",

    "the evolutionary track is used to determine the allowed ages of the clusters .",
    "the uncertainties of the colors allow a range of ages in most cases .",
    "however , clusters 36 are associated with h@xmath0  nebular emission , so the younger end of the range of allowed ages is more likely for these clusters .    because star clusters fade and redden as they evolve , to compare the photometry of clusters requires that one refer them to a common age .",

    "the model successfully recreates the weak turnover in each side of the velocity field , but the residual map shows that it had difficulty with the receding half turnover in the sense that it underestimates it and shifts it slightly north .",
    "there is another region of higher - than - average residuals just south of the center of the galaxy ; this area slightly overlaps the west sides of the large hole and knot in the h@xmath1i .",
    "this is also near the region of highest velocity dispersion in the galaxy , so perhaps it is not surprising that the velocity residuals are larger here as well . from figure",
    "[ fig : m1onresid ] , it can be seen that most of the regions of larger residuals ( especially negative residuals ) coincide with the kinks in the isovels that may be representative of a warp .",
    "the residuals are still small however , indicating that it s not a significant warp .",

    "ddo 43 stood out as unusually luminous for its rotation speed .",

    "( b@xmath4v)@xmath51 is nearly the same as that of the galaxy as a whole , but ( u@xmath4b)@xmath51 is 0.1 mag redder . these colors do not yield a consistent age for the stellar population , assuming a single star - forming event , perhaps because of contamination by a background galaxy population .",
    "however , the slightly redder color of the hole compared to the rest of the galaxy is consistent with an average age of the stellar population in the hole that is a little older than the surroundings . the star - forming event that formed hole 1 must be old enough",
    "that we do not , at least at our modest spatial resolution , see an obvious remnant of the ob association . on the other hand",
    ", the age must be young enough that the h@xmath1i  hole is still distinct and has not yet filled back in .",
    "wada , spaans , & kim ( 2000 ) have suggested a mechanism for producing holes in the interstellar medium of i m galaxies that does not depend on the energy input from massive stars .",
    "they argue that holes can be caused by nonlinear evolution of the multi - phase interstellar medium .",
    "this search for a non - stellar production mechanism for holes was motivated by the lack of evidence for aging ob associations in some of the holes in ddo 50 .",
    "the hole in ngc 6822 also presents a problem because it is located in the outer parts of the optical galaxy . while we can not rule out this sort of mechanism for the production of the holes in ddo 43 , the modest star - forming events needed to produce these holes are likely events in the evolution of an i m galaxy like ddo 43 .",
    "therefore , we do not need to invoke other mechanisms .",
    "the gas holes in ddo 43 are located near the center of the galaxy .",
    "a ridge of h@xmath1i  surrounds the holes to the north on three sides and a large h@xmath1i  complex sits to the south .",
    "the ridge and complex together give one the impression of a ring that is 2.7 kpc @xmath12 2.0 kpc . because the center of the ring is composed of several distinct holes rather than a single one",
    ", it seems likely that the ring is a consequence of multiple star - forming events that have taken place near the center of the galaxy .",
    "the gas shells that resulted have run into each other to give the appearance we have today .",
    "furthermore , this would be a natural means for producing the enhanced h@xmath1i  density that we see in the ring .",
    "the ring is where most of the star formation is taking place today . in this scenario ,",
    "the star formation in the ring would represent a second generation and would be an example of star - induced star formation ( gerola , seiden , & schulman 1980 ) .",
    "ddo 43 is not alone in containing a large gas ring .",
    "ddo 88 contains a beautifully complete ring 3.0 kpc in diameter ( simpson et al .",
    "in addition ngc 2366 appears to have a partially broken ring that is 5.5 kpc in diameter ( hunter et al .",
    "2001 ) , and m81dwa and sagdig have partial rings of 2 kpc and 1 kpc diameter ( sargent , sancisi , & lo 1983 ; young & lo 1997 ) .",
    "ddo 43 optically resembles other dwarf galaxies that fall at the faint end of the i m distribution .",
    "it is relatively isolated , with 270 pc to the nearest i m and 1.6 mpc to the nearest large galaxy ( a spiral ) .",
    "it probably hosts a large stellar bar : it exhibits boxy elliptical isophotes with a small shift in position angle proceeding from the inner to outer regions , and there is an almost 90  misalignment between the optical ( bar ) axis and the kinematic axis determined from the h@xmath1i  data . although the bar is large at 0.8r@xmath2 , galaxy - sized bars are often seen in ims that have bars .",
    "the ubv surface photometry reveals an exponential disk with a normal central surface brightness and an not - unusual scale length of 430 pc .",
    "the galaxy s integrated colors are normal , and like many small systems it exhibits little color gradient across the disk .",
    "there are six star clusters visible on the v image . based on their colors , evolutionary track models",
    "indicate that only one is possibly large enough to be considered a `` populous '' cluster ; all the others are relatively small .    in the h@xmath1i , ddo 43 s extended h@xmath1i  is emphasized by its large r@xmath104r@xmath66 ratio .",
    "there is an extensive , low - level h@xmath1i  envelope containing a high density ridge surrounding the center of the galaxy .",
    "this ridge contains higher density knots and lower density depressions in the h@xmath1i .",
    "44% of the total h@xmath1i  mass is located within this ridge , defined as the region having a column density in excess of 1@xmath101 cm@xmath43 .",
    "we have identified six knots with n@xmath105 cm@xmath43 ; the largest knot is roughly 750@xmath12400 pc across .",
    "there are four `` holes , '' the largest , located just north of the largest h@xmath1i  knot , is 850 pc across .",
    "holes of this size are often detected in ims and are thought to be the result of star formation activity .",
    "the largest hole in ddo 43 resembles the one formed by star formation that surrounds the ob association ngc 206 in m31 . however , there are no young star associations in ddo 43 s holes ; the stellar colors are slightly redder than those in the rest of the galaxy and they do not appear to be expanding , so they must be relatively old .",
    "the knots in the high density ridge form a broken ring interspersed with the holes .",
    "the structure of knots and holes we see today is most likely the result of the overlapping of expanding h@xmath1i  shells caused by the stellar winds and supernovae explosions from earlier star formation episodes .",
    "most of the current star formation is taking place in the ridge , possibly induced by the sweeping up of gas as the holes were formed .",
    "ddo 43 s current star formation rate is normal , falling in the middle range for ims .",
    "there are several moderate - size h@xmath1ii  regions scattered around the galaxy , but there is on average less star formation activity in the inner 0.75 kpc than expected based on a comparison of the azimuthally - averaged h@xmath0  and v - band surface densities . most of the h@xmath1ii  regions are located in areas of high h@xmath1i  surface density , and many of those are located near local peaks in the h@xmath1i , as is seen in other ims .",
    "a few of the h@xmath1ii  regions are associated with lower h@xmath1isurface density areas however , including the h@xmath1i  holes .",
    "kinematically , there is nothing strikingly unusual about ddo 43 .",
    "it is undergoing the primarily solid - body rotation seen in many dwarfs , with an s - distortion visible in the velocity field , possibly indicating the presence of a warp in the gas disk .",
    "the rotation curve levels off and possibly turns over .",
    "the maximum rotation velocity is 25 km s@xmath10 , which is higher than the original estimate .",
    "it was the low rotation velocity for its luminosity that caused this galaxy to be classified as a candidate `` fossil '' tidal dwarf .",
    "dwarf galaxies formed from tidal interactions are predicted to contain less dark matter than primordially formed dwarfs , so should have lower total masses and subsequently , lower rotation speeds .",
    "however , the revised velocity estimate puts it back in the normal area of the tully - fisher relation for ims , so there is no reason to think that ddo 43 formed from an interaction .",
    "the dispersion velocities in the h@xmath1i  indicate an average of @xmath92 10 km s@xmath10 , which is normal .",
    "there is one area of higher dispersion ; this is associated with the large hole .",
    "the h@xmath1i  spectra through the hole indicate that the gas motions are complex , with most of the spectra exhibiting four peak components .",
    "if the hole was produced by star formation activity , it would seem that the gas is still somewhat unsettled .",
    "overall , ddo 43 is a fairly typical gas - rich , optically faint , small dwarf galaxy .",
    "it has an extensive gas disk and a high m@xmath5/l@xmath3 ratio .",
    "the h@xmath1i  has been sculpted into a high density ridge forming a partial ring that contains knots and holes .",
    "this is most likely the result of multiple episodes of star formation at various times .",
    "the mechanical energy deposited in the gas has carved out regions of lower gas density as gas was swept up into expanding shells .",
    "high density regions occur where the shells have overlapped . as a result ,",
    "star formation was triggered in these areas as current star formation activity is located there .",
    "the shells are not currently expanding , so the events that formed them must have happened long ago .",
    "the current star formation rate is modest ; coupled with the large gas reservoir and modest sizes of the older clusters seen in v , it seems that ddo 43 has evolved slowly , and will continue to do so for the next several gyr .",
    "we wish to thank emily bowsher for examining the color ratio images of ddo 43 as part of the 2003 research experiences for undergraduates program of northern arizona university .",
    "dah obtained partial support for this research from the lowell research fund .",
    "additional support to dah , support for ten , and support for travel to flagstaff for ces came from grant ast-0204922 from the national science foundation .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
