    "mergers between clusters are exciting events , involving around @xmath10 ergs of kinetic energy . on cluster - wide scales the effects of the dissipation of this energy are evident in the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "x - ray observations of the icm in presumed cluster mergers often reveal non - spherical morphologies , sometimes with temperature variations and shocks . similarly , the presence of diffuse radio emission in the form of relics and halos seems to correlate with known cluster mergers . in such a dynamic environment , what is the effect on individual galaxies ?",
    "any answers are likely complicated by numerous , and often competing , effects .",
    "galaxies in groups which are being accreted by clusters may undergo bursts of star formation as time - varying tidal fields transfer gas to the galaxies centers @xcite .",
    "similar `` pre - processing '' of galaxies is found in simulations where galaxy - galaxy interactions and tidal perturbations are enhanced in groups and substructures around clusters @xcite . on a larger scale ,",
    "when clusters merge with each other they develop shocks in their intracluster gas and interactions between individual galaxies and these shocks may lead to starbursts @xcite . in the case of individual galaxies already within clusters , the successive influence of numerous high - speed passages may lead to starbursts (  harrassment , ",

    "gas - rich galaxies entering a cluster would experience ram pressure through interaction with the intracluster gas @xcite , possibly compressing their molecular clouds and initiating bursts of star formation @xcite .",
    "however , ram pressure is also a prime candidate for suppressing star formation in clusters , as it can efficiently remove the gas supply of the entering galaxies , thereby extinguishing any star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as a result ,",
    "the issue of whether or not a starburst ever occurs is an open one , with some authors finding evidence for such starburst histories ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with others favoring `` strangulation '' of star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "lastly , one should bear in mind that all of these arguments may be moot : the member galaxies of any single cluster may already be quiescent and gas poor , leaving little material available for transformation in a cluster merger .",
    "recently , radio investigations have been used to study galaxy activity in cluster mergers .",
    "radio emission is an excellent indicator of galaxy activity , as it can result from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) or star formation ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "in fact , in the absence of any contamination due to an agn the radio luminosity of a galaxy ( typically measured at 1.4  ghz ) is directly proportional to its star formation rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "much of the interest in radio investigations of cluster mergers was inspired by a2125 , a merging cluster studied in tandem with the relaxed cluster a2645 in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the clusters are of the same richness and redshift , yet a2125 has about an order of magnitude more radio galaxies .",
    "subsequent radio studies of presumed cluster mergers include the shapley supercluster ( a3556 , a3558 , and a3562 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a2255 @xcite , a2256 @xcite , a large sample of intermediate - redshift clusters @xcite , and a much more comprehensive analysis of a2125 @xcite",
    ". the resulting picture may not be so simple , with the fraction of galaxies hosting radio sources increased in some mergers ( a2125 , a2255 ) , normal in others ( a2256 ) , and potentially even decreased in others ( a3558 ) .",
    "these differences might be explained by noting the examined populations and considering the timing of the merger .",
    "the former point is merely that the effects of a cluster merger are likely different on star - forming galaxies than they would be on brighter and more massive agn , whereas the latter notes that cluster mergers proceed on @xmath11gyr timescales while the radio emission is associated with events whose duration is about an order of magnitude less .",
    "consequently , there are two clear directives for further observations : 1 ) to investigate previously - studied clusters to consistent and deep sensitivity limits , and 2 ) to investigate a larger number of merging clusters in order to better understand the role of merger timing .",
    "the shapley supercluster represents an ideal testbed for further investigation of the effects of cluster mergers on the evolution of member galaxies .",
    "the true extent of the supercluster is not determined , as redshift surveys covering increasing areas of the sky have continued to reveal its enormous scale through interconnected structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". at the center of the supercluster lies a3558 ( or shapley 8) , a very rich cluster ( abell richness class 4 ) flanked by a3556 to the west and a3562 as well as a pair of poor clusters identified in both the optical and x - ray ( sc1327 - 312 and sc1329 - 313 , see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) to the east .",
    "this collection of clusters forms the core of the supercluster , and has been studied extensively at a variety of wavelengths .",
    "furthermore , all of these clusters lie in the plane of the sky at @xmath12 making this a particularly attractive supercluster for a single observational campaign .",
    "several research collaborations have committed large amounts of optical observing time to the collection of hundreds of galaxy spectra in the shapley supercluster , and the resulting dynamical assessments depict an active region rich in substructure . the supercluster has been studied on large scales ( tens of mpc ) in an attempt to estimate its total mass @xcite since it lies in the direction of the local group s motion relative to the cosmic microwave background .",
    "@xcite presented a substructure analysis of the core of the supercluster , drawing on the velocities presented in a sequence of works @xcite .",
    "they applied the dedica algorithm to identify up to 21 significant substructures within the supercluster core , and concluded that either of two hypotheses held : 1 ) the core of the shapley supercluster represents a cluster - cluster merger viewed shortly after one cluster core has passed the other for the first time , or 2 ) the entire region is a complex of lesser mergers ( such as groups merging with each other and with larger clusters ) .",
    "similarly , x - ray observations indicate a dynamically rich system . the cluster known as sc1327 - 312 was first identified on the basis of _ einstein _ data @xcite , and subsequent studies with various x - ray observatories have continued to reveal interesting properties : for example , _ rosat _",

    "their interpretations were largely based on departures from expected relationships between @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 ( optical velocity dispersion ) .",
    "the ongoing merger in sc1329 - 313 was deduced from its fitted fe k@xmath16 line , indicating the cluster was out of ionization - equilibrium ( the fitted energy of the iron line was consistent with the h - like iron k@xmath16 line instead of the usual he - like line expected for the measured temperature of the cluster ) .",
    "@xcite were only able to confirm this result for sc1329 - 313 at the 2@xmath17 level , and instead argued that the whole system represented the aftermath of a major cluster - cluster merger seen after the first core passage , an interpretation also based on their optical and radio investigations . in this interpretation , the clusters other than a3558 are the remains of the merger .",
    "@xcite argued that sc1329 - 313 had recently passed through the northern outskirts of a3562 . despite the varied interpretations of the merger history and partners ,",
    "it is clear that the core of the shapley supercluster is a dynamically - rich system .",
    "prior radio works targeting specific regions within the system also reveal a complex environment .",
    "@xcite studied a3556 using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) and molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ) , identifying nine cluster radio galaxies including the unusual narrow - angle tail source j1324 - 3138 @xcite .",
    "this appears to be the remnant of a radio galaxy , where the central engine has switched off possibly in response to the cluster merger event .",
    "@xcite extended the same general radio survey of the shapley supercluster to include the cores of the other clusters in the chain , increasing the number of cluster radio galaxies to 28 . using these identifications to construct the radio luminosity function ( rlf ) , they found a deficit of powerful radio galaxies in the system relative to the cluster rlf determined in @xcite .",
    "they argued that cluster mergers may switch off existing radio sources , as appeared to be the case for j1324 - 3138 .",
    "@xcite continued the overall survey , in particular covering the region around a3562 .",
    "they identified 33 cluster radio galaxies ( 26 of which were not in the preceding works ) , and found that the deficit of powerful radio galaxies noted in @xcite was restricted to a3558 . among these sources",
    "were a number of lower radio luminosity sources , presumed to be starbursts .    in this paper , a comprehensive radio and optical view of the entire core of the supercluster",
    "is presented .",
    "the radio data were obtained with the nrao very large array ( vla ) and consist of a 63-pointing mosaic which covers nearly 7 square degrees at a fairly uniform sensitivity of @xmath1180 @xmath0jy per 16 beam .",
    "this makes it unique in that it covers the entire core of the shapley supercluster in a single observational campaign , and implies that agn and galaxies forming stars at rates as low as 1.0 m@xmath1 year@xmath2 are detected .",
    "the radio data are complemented by new optical imaging in @xmath3 and @xmath18 .",
    "the areal coverage and uniform sensitivity of these data represent the key advantages of this study : populations of active galaxies down to low activity levels may be studied across the full range of environmental conditions within the supercluster .",
    "this enables stronger conclusions about the potential correlation of increased activity within individual galaxies to regions of dynamical activity within the clusters which make up the supercluster .    for the sake of consistency with prior papers investigating the radio galaxy populations of nearby clusters , a cosmology with @xmath19 km  s@xmath2",
    "mpc@xmath2 and @xmath20 has been adopted .",
    "this yields a luminosity distance of 186.8 mpc to the supercluster ( using @xmath21 ) , meaning @xmath22 kpc . for reference",
    ", these values become @xmath23 mpc and @xmath24 kpc for the _ wmap _ cosmology with @xmath25 km  s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "the initial radio observations were performed in 2001 june with the vla in its cnb configuration .",
    "this configuration , observing at a frequency of 1.4  ghz , is well suited to the study of star - forming galaxies in the shapley supercluster with an angular resolution of @xmath1115 ( 12.4 kpc ) , meaning low surface brightness emission spread over the disk of a galaxy will not be missed .",
    "the extended north arm of the configuration also results in a more circular beam .",
    "the program was scheduled over five days , each consisting of a 6-hour block centered on transit of a3558 ( see table [ tbl - radobs ] for a listing of all pointings and observation dates ) .",
    "unfortunately , data were lost due to thunderstorms and strong winds stowing the array on 2001 june 20 and mechanical problems on 2001 june 21 . to replace these data ,",
    "a single additional 6-hour track was scheduled during the subsequent cnb configuration of the vla in 2002 september .",
    "the conditions for these observations were less favorable , as they were performed during daytime where the sun is a source of additional noise .",
    "the observational strategy consisted of observing the core of the supercluster through a mosaic of individual vla pointings . these were arranged in a hexagonal grid to provide nearly uniform sensitivity across the entire area , with an 18 spacing between adjacent pointings .",
    "this mosaic strategy is the same as that employed by the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimeters ( first , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) although with a tighter grid spacing . originally , 70 pointings were planned but this was pared down to 63 due to the lost observing time .",
    "the seven pointings removed from the grid were taken from the edges to minimize the effect on the final mosaic coverage .",
    "the final 63 pointings are summarized in table [ tbl - radobs ] , and a footprint of the covered area may be viewed in figure [ fig - foot ] .",
    "the radio data were obtained in line mode at 1.4  ghz , consisting of 28 channels each of 3.125  mhz bandwidth ( two sets of seven channels at each polarization ) .",
    "each pointing center was visited only once to minimize the amount of time spent moving among pointings . to account for the varying system temperature of the vla at 1.4  ghz as a function of elevation",
    ", the dwell times were adjusted in order to achieve a similar sensitivity at each pointing .",
    "the minimum dwell time ( for sources observed near transit ) was 20 minutes , while sources at the beginning and ends of the runs were observed for 27 minutes .",
    "although the author sure thought he was clever in doing this , he failed to respect the importance of good ( @xmath28 ) coverage . for the most part",
    ", the pointings were prioritized such that the edges of the supercluster corresponded to those with poorer ( @xmath28 ) coverage . to improve the ( @xmath28 ) coverage of a few central pointings ,",
    "they were revisited for brief periods ( @xmath29 minutes ) during the 29 september 2002 observations .",
    "the effect of the ( @xmath28 ) coverage will be addressed in more detail below .",
    "flux calibration was achieved using 3c286 , with calibration of phases and bandpasses performed from roughly hourly observations of the nearby calibrator source j1316 - 336 .",
    "the nrao s astronomical image processing system ( aips ) was used to calibrate and image the data , following the usual procedures for 1.4  ghz data .",
    "briefly , the data for each pointing were calibrated ( including antenna - specific weights ) and reduced individually .",
    "ideally , one would handle the ( @xmath28 ) data for each pointing in a manner which both produces a consistent beam across all pointings and does so with good characteristics ( i.e. , a nice gaussian with minimal sidelobes ) .",
    "this is where the effect of moving to each position in the pointing grid only once is most relevant . for several of the pointings at the edges of the pointing grid ,",
    "the resulting beam is highly elongated .",
    "this renders it virtually impossible to obtain a consistent beam across all pointings , necessitating the compromise of choosing parameters which produce beams with the same area and using a circular restoring beam of equal area in the final maps .",
    "table [ tbl - radobs ] indicates the initial beam sizes .",
    "each pointing was imaged in @xmath29 fields , with four fields covering the primary beam and additional fields dedicated to outlying bright sources .",
    "iterations of imaging and self - calibration were performed until the final images for each pointing were created . at this point ,",
    "the cleaned sources were restored with a 16 circular beam for combining into the final mosaic .",
    "the rms noise of these individual pointings ranged from about 75 to 125 @xmath0jy beam@xmath2 .",
    "the final mosaic was created by combining the reduced images for all 63 pointings . at this stage , the flanking fields dedicated to bright sources were ignored and only the four fields covering the primary beam for each pointing were used .",
    "the contribution of each image to the mosaic was properly weighted by its signal - to - noise , as discussed in @xcite , with the images truncated at the point where the response of the vla had dropped to @xmath30 of its peak ( i.e. , each pointing images about a 40 diameter ) .",
    "the noise characteristics of the final mosaic are quite good , with a typical rms of about 80 @xmath0jy beam@xmath2 over the area described as within 2 mpc of the centers of the individual abell clusters .",
    "the noisiest region within this area has a local noise around 115 @xmath0jy beam@xmath2 and is found to the east of the center of abell 3558 .",
    "it is caused by several bright sources , particularly the quasar at j133019.1 - 312259 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the cleanest regions have rms noise as low as 62 @xmath0jy beam@xmath2 .",
    "the final mosaic is available upon request from the author .",
    "the catalog of radio sources was then created using the task sad , which identifies peaks in a map and fits them with gaussians .",
    "parameters of importance are saved from these fits , including the source position , peak flux density , integral flux density , major and minor axis , plus position angle .",
    "sad also creates a residual map , which was inspected to identify any sources for which gaussian fits failed ( usually strong extended sources ) .",
    "these were manually added to the radio source catalog .",
    "the relative flux scale was found to be consistent with the nvss via comparison of the fluxes of unresolved sources .",
    "optical images in both @xmath3 and @xmath18 ( hereafter referred to simply as `` @xmath4 '' ) filters were obtained in 2002 march and april using the cerro tololo inter - american observatory 1.5 m telescope with the cassegrain focus ccd imager . using the @xmath31 focus provided a wide field of view of 148 with 044 pixels .",
    "even so , the large area of the core of the supercluster required numerous individual telescope pointings : 152 fields in each @xmath3 and @xmath4 , arranged in a simple grid with a 14 spacing .",
    "figure [ fig - foot ] depicts the coverage of the optical fields in relation to the radio mosaic .",
    "data for this project were collected on the nights of march 24 and 25 ( kindly provided by michael ledlow during a run for a related program ) , and march 29 , march 31 , and april 1 .",
    "sky brightness was an issue , as these dates straddled the full moon .",
    "the exposures were prioritized such that the @xmath3 images were collected during the darker conditions , and exposure times were adjusted slightly for the conditions on a nightly basis .",
    "the @xmath4 exposures ranged from 120 to 150 seconds , while the @xmath3 exposures were either 180 or 240 seconds . the seeing varied from 11 ( about the best possible with the @xmath31 focus ) to 20 , with most exposures falling in the @xmath32 range .",
    "data reduction followed the standard reduction steps .",
    "the images were bias subtracted and then flat fielded using twilight frames collected during several of the nights .",
    "the astrometry was registered using about 20 unsaturated usno a2.0 stars per field @xcite , yielding rms errors of under 025 .",
    "the photometry was set by observations of `` selected area '' fields from @xcite , performed nightly and at a range of airmass .",
    "the derived relationships were :    @xmath33    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the background - subtracted counts from the source , @xmath36 is the integration time measured in seconds , and @xmath37 is the airmass . the consistency of the photometry was checked using stars at the edges of the science exposures , where the overlap of the pointings produced numerous comparison objects ( see below ) .",
    "lists of optical sources were generated by field using sextractor @xcite .",
    "the most important parameters proved to be those related to the background as scattered light was an issue , particularly for the @xmath4 images collected during times of high sky brightness .",
    "this produced images with a gradient in the apparent background which often changed sharply along one edge of the ccd .",
    "choosing a background mesh size too large failed to properly respond to this effect , while smaller background mesh sizes performed poorly around the larger real objects . in this latter case , some of the counts corresponding to the bigger elliptical galaxies and brighter saturated stars",
    "get included in the background resulting in extracted magnitudes for these objects which are fainter than their true magnitudes . since",
    "one of the main uses of the optical magnitudes is to select galaxies brighter than prescribed limits , the chosen mesh size erred more toward correct handling of the scattered light .",
    "this means that the reported magnitudes for the brightest elliptical galaxies ( @xmath38 ) are up to @xmath39 mags fainter than their real values .",
    "the derived magnitudes for all fields correspond to the fixed aperture size of 159 in radius , which is the gunn - oke aperture @xcite at the assumed redshift of the supercluster ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "initially , the color term in the above photometric equations was ignored and later introduced when the output catalogs were merged .",
    "further , when the source catalogs for the individual fields were merged the magnitudes were also corrected for galactic extinction using the values of @xcite , based on the @xmath40 and @xmath41 values for the center of each 148 field . limiting magnitudes , based on inspection of number count histograms , ranged from 18.5 to 19.5 in @xmath4 and from 19.5 to 21 in @xmath3 .    the consistency of the photometry from field to field was then checked using the regions of overlap .",
    "the magnitude errors reported by sextractor are based simply on counting statistics , so this step essentially determines the errors resulting from application of the above photometric equations to the collected data .",
    "it would also reveal any magnitude zero point shifts as would occur under non - photometric conditions .",
    "all designated stars whose photometry was not flagged by sextractor were used .",
    "the consistency of the @xmath3 photometry was excellent , with a standard deviation under 0.05 mag for objects with magnitudes brighter than @xmath42 and still under 0.15 mag for galaxies as faint as @xmath43 .",
    "as previously suggested , the @xmath4 photometry was less consistent with a standard deviation of less than 0.1 mag out to @xmath44 and rising to 0.2 mag at @xmath45 . for simplicity",
    ", these findings have been generalized and an additional error of 0.05 mag in @xmath3 and 0.1 mag in @xmath4 have been included in the reported photometry .",
    "lastly , the merged catalog of all optical sources was edited to remove duplicates ( see additional discussion below ) .",
    "the radio and optical source catalogs were then merged to create the final list of radio galaxies .",
    "the adopted conventions for creation of the radio galaxy catalog were :    * the radio peak flux must be greater than 330 @xmath0jy , chosen as a 5@xmath17 detection in the regions of the mosaic map with the lowest noise .",
    "* either the radio peak flux or integral flux must be greater than five times the local rms noise , as evaluated in a 6 box centered on the peak in the radio emission .",
    "* the galaxy must be brighter than @xmath46 , which corresponds to @xmath47 in the adopted cosmology .",
    "this limit is one magnitude fainter than that used in @xcite and related papers , allowing the present study to sample cluster radio galaxies down to fainter levels .",
    "it is also safely brighter than the completeness limit of the worst @xmath4 band fields .",
    "although radio sources with detected optical counterparts fainter than 17.36 are present in the data , most such radio galaxies are safely assumed background objects .",
    "* the separation between radio and optical position must be less than 7 ( except in cases of extended powerful radio galaxies ) .",
    "the probability of chance coincidence of radio and optical objects satisfying the above criteria was evaluated by shifting the optical catalog by arbitrary amounts and re - performing the correlation . from this analysis",
    ", it is expected that about 4 sources in the final list are false .",
    "however , the false detection probability for sources within 2 mpc of the cluster centers and with @xmath48 and @xmath49 w hz@xmath2 is much lower .",
    "these are the limits used for the comparison sample in the radio galaxy fraction analysis ( see section [ sec - rgfrac ] ) , and the false detection probability corresponding to the 7 separation limit approximately matches that used in construction of that comparison sample .    perhaps the most critical step in source identification was a thorough visual inspection .",
    "the radio contours were overlaid on the optical images along with markers identifying sources in each the radio and optical catalogs . in the case of the radio data ,",
    "this step allowed for extended radio galaxies to be identified in addition to any other problem cases not fit by sad .",
    "the extended radio sources are often missed because the peak in their emission does not necessarily coincide with the optical location of the galaxy . for the optical data ,",
    "the visual inspection provided a check on the sextractor results including the star / galaxy segregation for problem objects such as close pairs of faint stars and galaxies .",
    "these false bright objects were removed from the catalog of optical sources .",
    "the use of markers for each of the radio and optical catalogs also enabled the removal of any duplications which were missed in the previous steps .",
    "finally , a small number of optical galaxies in close proximity to bright stars were absent from the sextractor catalogs .",
    "magnitudes for these galaxies were determined manually by summing counts within irregular shaped apertures designed to avoid contamination by the nearby stars .",
    "the final list is presented in table [ tbl - radgals ] .",
    "this table includes the optical position , magnitudes and color , integral radio flux , peak radio flux , a marker indicating whether the radio emission was unresolved , local noise at the location of the radio source , and separation between the optical and radio positions .",
    "those sources for which the aips task jmfit found a minimum size of zero for the major axis were assumed to be unresolved .",
    "for such sources , the fitted peak flux density is a better representation of the true flux of the source than the fitted integral radio flux ( e.g. , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in addition , the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) was searched to determine whether velocity information was available for each of the 210 entries in table [ tbl - radgals ] .",
    "a total of 123 galaxies had public velocity information , including at least 104 members of the shapley supercluster ( see next section ) .",
    "this information is also presented in table [ tbl - radgals ] . in all subsequent text ,",
    "the 210 radio - detected galaxies will be referred to simply as `` radio galaxies , '' with the 104 spectroscopically - confirmed members of the shapley supercluster called `` cluster radio galaxies '' or sometimes `` cluster members . ''",
    "to determine which radio galaxies belong to the shapley supercluster , the individual cluster recession velocities and dispersions ( @xmath15 ) of @xcite were used . allowing galaxies within @xmath50 of any cluster / substructure , the minimum and maximum velocities describing the supercluster are 10934 km  s@xmath2 and 17684 km  s@xmath2 . in practice , these limits correspond to those for the brighter galaxies in a3558 ( @xmath51 km  s@xmath2 and @xmath52 km  s@xmath2 ; * ? ? ? * ) . as noted previously ,",
    "there are 104 cluster member radio galaxies identified in the present study , nearly doubling the total identified in prior studies .",

    "the other three foreground galaxies belong to the hydra - centaurus wall ( @xmath53 km  s@xmath2 , see * ? ? ?",
    "a further two radio galaxies were associated with galaxy pairs in ned .",
    "although the galaxies hosting the radio emission did not have ned velocities , their companions did have cluster velocities and hence they may tentatively be considered cluster members which would bring the total to 106 .",

    "the third possible head - tail source , j132802 - 314521 , consists of a strong core centered on the galaxy plus what appears to be a diffuse tail ( figure [ fig-132802 ] ) .",
    "it is possible that these features are unrelated and the potential tail is a background source .",
    "however , the luminosity of the core portion of the radio emission is @xmath56 w hz@xmath2 .",

    "more than half of all bright galaxies are radio detections , translating to an increase in activity significant at about 99% confidence . with the exception of sc1329 - 313 , the other clusters have marginal excesses significant at about the 85% level .",

    "as would be expected based on the large overlap in areas covered by the 2 mpc radial sampling limit ( e.g. , refer to figure [ fig - foot ] ) , sc1327 - 312 and sc1329 - 313 also have larger radio galaxy fractions than would be expected based on the comparison sample , at 98.5% and 99.9% significance respectively .",

    "an advantage to performing one study for the entire core of the supercluster is that any variations in radio galaxy fraction across the clusters may be assessed in light of environmental factors . to this end",
    ", a map showing the distribution of the radio galaxy fractions was created . at each point in the map",
    "the radio galaxy fraction was computed within a 0.5 mpc radius , using a radio detection threshold of @xmath78 w hz@xmath2 and corrected galaxy counts with magnitudes @xmath48 ( i.e. , luminosity and magnitude limits identical to the preceding analysis ) .",
    "the choice of a 0.5 mpc sampling region was motivated by the desire to include large enough areas to have meaningful numbers of sources while still avoiding edge effects within the main body of the supercluster .",
    "including regions beyond 2 mpc of the respective cluster centers adds three additional radio galaxies assumed to be cluster members but for which no velocity information was available , and two further cases where radio detections without velocity measurements were assumed to be background sources on the basis of their red colors .",
    "thus , contamination by foreground / background radio galaxies is still minimal .",
    "the resulting map is presented in figure [ fig - fracn ] , where the grey - scale indicates the radio galaxy fraction . to help indicate where high fractions result from low number statistics ( e.g. , only two local galaxies of",

    "the increase in activity in a3562 is readily apparent , particularly in the direction of a3558 .",

    "the present study includes much deeper data , so it is illustrative to consider fainter sources . figure [ fig - fract ] parallels figure [ fig - fracn ] in that it is for sources with @xmath48 , but in this case radio sources with @xmath88 w hz@xmath2 are considered detections . the lower limit on radio luminosity corresponds to 0.5 mjy ( i.e. , 5@xmath17 detections in the noisier regions of the mosaic ) while the upper limit prevents direct overlap with the radio galaxies used in figure [ fig - fracn ] .",
    "figure [ fig - fracp ] is for the optically faintest galaxies in the present study , those with @xmath89 .",
    "the radio detection limit is again @xmath90 w hz@xmath2 ; none of these fainter galaxies have @xmath91 w hz@xmath2 .",

    "the identification of 210 radio galaxies in the core of the shapley supercluster provides a good database for evaluation of galaxy activity .",
    "only 34 of these radio galaxies may be removed from consideration as galaxies merely seen in projection on the supercluster , half of which are known foreground / background objects on the basis of existing optical spectroscopy with the other half appearing too red to be consistent with supercluster membership . of 104 confirmed cluster members ,",
    "at least 40 may be used for a statistical analysis of radio galaxy fractions which parallels that of mo03 .",
    "the analysis of radio galaxy fractions indicates varied activity across the supercluster . in general , there are two broad findings which need to be understood : 1 ) the decrease in the radio galaxy fraction for galaxies with optical magnitudes near @xmath92 , generally seen across the entire core of the supercluster ( i.e. , the whole area studied ) ; and 2 ) the strong increase in the radio galaxy fraction for optically - faint galaxies in the vicinity of a3562 .",
    "these two points will now be discussed in light of environmental effects and prior theoretical and observational findings .",
    "examination of the locations of the radio galaxies ( figures [ fig - fracn ] - [ fig - fracp ] ) points to the region around a3562 as one of high activity .",
    "this is especially the case for the abundant optically - fainter galaxies , where the increase in the radio galaxy fraction for a3562 was significant at very high confidence .",
    "the fact that this increase corresponds to a specific region within the core of the supercluster indicates that there must be some difference in environment intrinsic to this region . in mo03",
    ", it was argued that a2255 had a larger active galaxy population as a result of an ongoing cluster - cluster merger .",
    "the a2255 merger axis is believed to be perpendicular to the observer and viewed very near the time when the cores of the merging partners are coincident . according to the simulations of @xcite , at this particular time galaxies will cross the shock front formed between the merging clusters and experience a spike in ram pressure , thereby instigating starbursts .",
    "recent x - ray analysis supports a similar picture in regards to the merger history and timing for a3562 .",
    "@xcite used a 6-pointing _ xmm _ mosaic to study the hydrodynamics of a3562 and the sc1329 - 313 group .",
    "they found an interesting assortment of properties , including temperature and entropy substructure and evidence for disruption of the core of sc1329 - 313 . on @xmath11100 kpc scales , the emission of a3562 and sc1329 - 313 point towards one another , indicating interaction .",
    "the properties are well described by a scenario in which sc1329 - 313 has recently passed to the north of the core of a3562 , traveling toward the west , and been deflected to the south and towards the observer .",
    "the motion was supersonic , having an implied mach number @xmath931.3 .",
    "this passage would then have created a shock wave , as well as having produced oscillations of the core of a3562 .",
    "examination of figure [ fig - fracn ] is qualitatively consistent with this scenario .",
    "the region associated with an excess of radio galaxies corresponds to the expected location of the shock associated with the passage of sc1329 - 313 . in the @xcite model ,",
    "early in the merger the shock front acts as a buffer for any gas - rich galaxies in sc1329 - 313 , protecting them from ram pressure removal of their gas .",
    "however , at a time around core passage the shock front decelerates and the galaxies pass through it , thereby experiencing a sharp increase in ram pressure leading to starbursts .",
    "an important consideration to this model for the shapley supercluster , however , is the pre - merger nature of the active galaxies .",
    "should they have been members of either a3562 or sc1329 - 313 , the high efficiency of ram pressure stripping ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) implies that it would be reasonable to expect that they were already gas poor and not likely to undergo a subsequent starburst .",
    "consequently , the cluster merger itself may be indicative of larger - scale interactions : as the pair of clusters merge along a filament , outlying groups and field galaxies along the filament are also thrown into the mix .",
    "it is these galaxies which would cause the increase in the observed radio galaxy fraction . in a similar light ,",
    "the merger may induce activity in the outlying groups through tidal interactions @xcite . a picture along these same lines",
    "is evoked for the unusually high fraction of radio galaxies in a2125 @xcite , and seems to fit for the curious radio galaxy j133048 - 314325 in the shapley supercluster .",
    "figure [ fig-133048 ] depicts j133048 - 314325 , which superficially has the radio morphology of a wide - angle tail ( wat ) but a radio luminosity a factor of ten lower than such sources .",
    "other galaxies are easily visible nearby this source , the radio galaxy j133051 - 314417 and a face - on spiral galaxy ( j133047 - 314339 ) within the radio contours of j133048 - 314325 ( note that this spiral galaxy was designated the radio counterpart in lower resolution observations by * ? ? ?",
    "these three galaxies appear to be a compact group , as indicated by their small spatial and velocity separation ( a maximum separation of just 1 , or about 50 kpc ; ned velocities of 13394 , 13226 , and 13815 km  s@xmath2 in order of increasing galaxy ra ) .",
    "a potentially useful analogy for this system is that of stephan s quintet in which a high velocity intruder galaxy ( ngc  7318a ) has interacted with the intragroup medium ( igm ) around ngc  7318a and ngc  7319 .",
    "radio continuum emission from this system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) arises from a combination of sources , including the seyfert nucleus of ngc  7319 , star formation , and the large ( @xmath94 kpc ) shock caused by the interaction .",
    "much of the star formation , interestingly enough , is within the igm and not simply associated with individual galaxies of stephan s quintet .",
    "while this star formation does contribute to the 1.4  ghz radio continuum , the majority of the radio emission is associated with a radio ridge delineating the shock front ( about 1.5 mjy for star formation , 35 mjy for the shock , and 29 mjy for the seyfert galaxy ngc  7319 ) .",
    "inspection of the radio contours of j133048 - 314325 suggests a similar interaction of the sources , potentially explaining their activity .",
    "j133051 - 314417 would be the intruder galaxy , with support for this interpretation being its @xmath95 km  s@xmath2 velocity offset from the other galaxies and the general shape of the radio emission which is suggestive of j133051 - 314417 having passed through the igm in a southeasterly direction .",
    "the extended morphology of j133048 - 314325 would then be the combination of possible agn emission from the galaxy itself , plus shock and star formation emission . that j133048 - 314325 might be an agn",
    "is suggested by its optical properties , which include what might be an unresolved optical nucleus coincident with the peak in the radio emission , its blue color @xmath96 , and an unusually bright absolute magnitude of @xmath97 .",
    "it is possible that the unresolved optical component and bright total magnitude arise from a foreground star , as no emission lines are noted in the spectroscopy reported by @xcite , the literature source for the ned velocity .",
    "however , it would be a remarkable coincidence if a foreground star were to lie in projection directly on the nucleus of a galaxy which has moderately strong radio emission .",
    "the portion of the j133048 - 314325 emission that would be associated with the shock would then be the ridge to the southeast .",
    "using tvstat to evaluate the flux associated with this feature produces a radio luminosity of @xmath98 w hz@xmath2 , comparable to that of the shock ridge in stephan s quintet ( @xmath99 w hz@xmath2 ) .",
    "its size , @xmath1160 kpc , is also similar to that of the shock ridge in stephan s quintet .",
    "a contribution to the total emission along the northwest edge could then come from star formation in the spiral galaxy j133047 - 314339 .",
    "the entire system lies about 11 to the northwest of the cataloged position of sc1329 - 313 , very near the peak in the galaxy surface density indicated in figure [ fig - fracn ] .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to think that the hypothesized interaction akin to that seen in stephan s quintet is the result of tidal forces from the larger merger of sc1329 - 313 with a3562 .",
    "this hypothesis can easily be tested by future observations .",
    "additional radio observations at shorter wavelengths would reveal any spectral index variations , where any shock emission would have steeper spectral index ( e.g. , the shock ridge in stephan s quintet has @xmath100 * ? ? ?",
    "higher resolution observations might also help separate any agn emission associated with j133048 - 314325 .",
    "finally , @xcite use infrared observations and long - slit optical spectroscopy to reveal regions associated with shocked gas and those associated with photoionization from star formation .",
    "returning to our discussion of radio galaxy fractions , there is less direct evidence for the `` preferred '' location of activity around sc1329 - 313 when examining fractions at fainter optical and radio limits .",
    "however , these results may still be interpretted within the framework described above .",
    "the inclusion of galaxies with fainter radio luminosities while keeping the optical limit at @xmath48 ( figure [ fig - fract ] ) produces a more uniform distribution of radio galaxy activity within the supercluster . for",
    "the faintest optical galaxies studied , those with @xmath101 between -19 and -20 , the radio sources are again found mainly within a3562 ( figure [ fig - fracp ] ) . in each of these cases , the star formation rates implied by the radio emission are @xmath102 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this would be a substantial amount of star formation in the fainter galaxies ( i.e. , those with @xmath103 ) , and a typical star formation rate for normal brighter spirals such as the milky way .",
    "thus , it again appears that the optically fainter galaxies are likely to be starbursts , and that these types of galaxies are found preferentially in the vicinity of a3562",
    ".    why would there be different effects on the faint and intermediate magnitude populations ?",
    "the answer to this question might lie in the different galaxy morphologies that are included within these magnitude ranges .",
    "galaxies in the intermediate magnitude range will be larger and more likely to have significant bulges .",
    "it is a common prediction of evolutionary models that bulges stabilize galaxies against transformation ( e.g. , galaxy - galaxy mergers and harassment , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is because the predicted evolution is usually driven by the rapid inflow of gas to the nuclei of galaxies , where it creates a nuclear starburst .",
    "thus , brighter galaxies with bulges are more resistant to evolutionary changes than fainter , disk - dominated galaxies .",
    "although this can easily explain why more dramatic change is seen in the fainter galaxy population , it is still difficult to understand why there would be a deficit of intermediate magnitude radio galaxies in the shapley supercluster relative to other clusters .",
    "it is possible that the radio galaxies in this magnitude range found in other clusters represent the steady trickle of isolated field galaxies that enter the clusters , and that the dramatic merger environment of the shapley supercluster precludes such objects .      are these results consistent with the prior radio studies of the core of the shapley supercluster ?",

    "the lo96 rlf was constructed using only elliptical galaxies with @xmath104 , so it is not immediately comparable to those in the figure .",
    "however , applying a simple scaling which amounts to saying that 13.5% of all cluster galaxies with @xmath48 are ellipticals with @xmath104 produces an excellent agreement with the bright end of the rlf derived from the @xcite comparison sample .",
    "since essentially all radio galaxies with @xmath55 w hz@xmath2 are bright ellipticals , this agreement is expected .    as can be seen in figure [ fig - rlf ] ,",
    "there does appear to be a deficit of the more luminous radio galaxies in a3558 and in the shapley supercluster core region in general .",
    "this might have been expected based on the result of a lower fraction of intermediate optical magnitude radio galaxies , although that finding was irrespective of radio luminosity and was countered slightly by the increased fraction of optically bright radio galaxies .",
    "the difficulty in assessing any deficit of strong radio galaxies relative to the lo96 rlf is that galaxies with such high luminosities are intrinsically rare , so demonstrating a statistically significant absence for a specific cluster is hampered by number statistics . in their analysis , v00 attempted to perform a more direct comparison with the lo96 rlf by correcting total galaxy counts to estimate the number of ellipticals and s0s in the a3558 environment .",
    "they arrived at a net of 185 elliptical and s0 galaxies , of which 17 were identified radio galaxies .",

    "this produced a list of 43 galaxies , of which three had radio luminosities high enough for consideration .",
    "a simple integration of the lo96 rlf would predict about 6 radio galaxies , and thus yields a deficit that would be claimed with 91% significance .",
    "the morphologies of the 43 selected galaxies were assessed visually using the @xmath4 images along with ellipticities determined by sextractor . for most of these galaxies , ned also provided a morphology ( including confirmation of cluster membership via a published velocity ) and the assignments were consistent .",
    "removal of non - ellipticals left only 24 galaxies , including the three radio galaxies .",
    "this is almost exactly the fraction predicted by the lo96 rlf .",
    "this analysis underscores the uncertainties involved in comparing luminosity functions constructed using small numbers of galaxies .",
    "note that although the preceding discussion was based on photometry , the alternate procedure of v00 using spectroscopy is similarly effected : selecting galaxies on the basis of non - emission line spectra will include s0 galaxies as well as `` passive spirals '' @xcite and potentially even normal spirals whose fiber spectra sample just their bulge components . in summary , although there may be a reduction in the fraction of a3558 s elliptical galaxy population which host radio sources , it is questionable whether this reduction is significant .",
    "g04 noted only marginal evidence for an increase in the radio - emitting faint galaxy population in a3562 , whereas in the current work it is reported as highly significant .",
    "similarly , their analysis of the data presented in mo03 suggested that the radio galaxy fraction in a2255 was only marginally greater than the comparison clusters .",
    "this difference in interpretation is caused primarily by the adopted statistical methods .",
    "using the same magnitude ranges described above , g04 calculated the fraction of radio galaxies for each cluster .",
    "they then calculated the fraction for the full comparison sample as the mean of these values , with the standard deviation representing the error .",
    "the procedure of mo03 ( and used here ) treats the comparison sample as a whole .",
    "in essence , it is an application of the binomial distribution where the comparison sample is used to determine the expected probability . using numbers for faint galaxies from table",
    "[ tbl - faintfracs ] , 20 of 1104.6 comparison sample galaxies were radio detections so the statistical question is : what is the probability that finding 11 of 113.2 galaxies ( i.e. , the results for a3562 ) is consistent with this parent distribution ?",
    "the @xmath86 nature of the actual test takes into account that the `` true fraction , '' i.e. , the 20 of 1104.6 from the comparison sample , is not known with certainty as would be assumed if one used the standard binomial probability function .",
    "these differences in applied statistical tests are the reason that g04 ascribed only marginal significance to the excess activity in a2255 .",
    "note that in the case of a3562 , the g04 numbers for radio detections and total galaxies do not produce a significant result regardless of the statistical method used .",
    "presumably this is the result of differences in the areas surveyed .",
    "although the radio data presented herein identify the region around sc1329 - 313 to have an excess of active galaxies , they only indirectly address the level of this activity .",
    "the important question with respect to cluster evolutionary models , particularly those applied to the butcher - oemler effect , is whether the active galaxies are starbursts or more normal star - forming galaxies which have just entered the supercluster . in some studies ,",
    "clusters of galaxies at moderate redshifts ( @xmath108 ) show evidence for starbursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while other studies suggest star formation is gradually extinguished as stripping removes the gaseous halos from galaxies , thereby removing the reservoir needed for future star formation (  strangulation ,  e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , the data presented herein do not allow for straightforward testing of such issues as the radio emission may include an agn component . in the case of the optically fainter galaxies ( @xmath109 )",
    ", a good case can be made for starbursts on the basis of their relatively high radio luminosities and the fact that agn are rare in low mass galaxies .",
    "for the brighter radio galaxies , ideally one would use optical spectroscopy in comparison with models ( as done in * ? ? ? * ) or data at other wavelengths such as the uv in order to quantify the past - to - present star formation and fraction of total stellar mass created in recent starbursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as alluded to in the case of the fainter galaxies , one possible available avenue is to rely on the strength of the radio emission to indicate the level of present star formation and the @xmath4 magnitude as a proxy for total stellar mass .",
    "the ratio of these quantities would then be a measure of the relative strength of the current star formation .",
    "the radio - to - optical flux ratio , @xmath110 , was calculated using the definition presented in @xcite : @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the flux density at 6940@xmath113 determined using the @xmath4 magnitude via @xmath114 . to reduce contamination due to agn ,",
    "galaxies brighter than @xmath115 were removed along with those redder than @xmath116 ( i.e. , remove probable red sequence objects down to the fainter magnitudes studied ) .",
    "in addition a minimum 1.4  ghz flux of 0.5 mjy was required to remove potential bias caused by variation in the sensitivity of the radio data across the supercluster .",
    "after removal of galaxies with published velocities placing them outside the supercluster , this resulted in a set of 83 galaxies for testing ( 48 of which did have published velocities indicating supercluster membership ) .",
    "specific regions were compared via a wilcox test to determine whether any exhibited evidence for higher @xmath110 values , and hence more likely greater relative levels of star formation .",
    "no highly significant variation in @xmath110 values across the core of the supercluster was found , although there is slight evidence that those in the vicinity of sc1329 - 313 do have higher @xmath110 .",
    "this result was always less than @xmath117 , and slightly dependent on sub - samples used ( e.g. , how the regions were defined in ra and dec , whether or not galaxies without published velocities were included , what optical magnitude ranges were compared , etc . ) .",
    "hence , this simple statistical analysis is suggestive of increased starburst activity associated with sc1329 - 313 , although this clearly needs to be confirmed through a more direct study .",
    "this paper has presented a comprehensive radio study of the core of the shapley supercluster .",
    "the vla has been used to map a nearly 7 square degree area through a mosaic of pointings which provide moderately uniform noise characteristics across the entire area . in conjunction with optical imaging , radio detections for 210 galaxies with @xmath5",
    "were presented .",
    "these include 104 galaxies with velocities placing them within the supercluster , which approximately doubles the previously known total of radio galaxies in the core of the shapley supercluster .",
    "in addition , 2 radio galaxies are members of cataloged pairs whose companions have supercluster velocities and 8 radio galaxies are likely associated with the supercluster but are formally placed in the foreground ( 9000 km  s@xmath2 @xmath118 10934 km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "of those radio galaxies without velocity measurements , 68 have optical colors which do not rule out supercluster membership .    across the entire core of the supercluster , intermediate optical magnitude ( @xmath83 )",
    "galaxies appear less likely to host radio sources than their counterparts in a large comparison sample .",
    "about 5% of such galaxies were found to be radio sources with @xmath49 w hz@xmath2 , whereas 15% of the comparison sample were .",
    "this deficit is offset somewhat by the brighter galaxies ( @xmath8 ) of the shapley supercluster being more likely to be radio sources .    while these results generally pertained to the entire region surveyed ,",
    "a more dramatic effect was observed in the fainter galaxies ( @xmath85 ) localized around a3562 and sc1329 - 313 .",
    "these galaxies were much more likely to be radio sources than anticipated on the basis of comparison clusters , with the high significance of the result being unaffected by changes in the assumed background .",
    "on the basis of their blue colors and radio luminosities , these galaxies are presumably starbursts .",
    "it is fascinating that this very region is identified by recent x - ray analysis as the location of an ongoing merger of sc1329 - 313 with a3562 and the rest of the supercluster .",
    "the remainder of the supercluster does not exhibit any statistical excess of radio galaxies among its optically fainter population , underscoring the potential importance of cluster mergers in galaxy evolution .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with radio studies of other active clusters , notably a2125 and a2255 .",
    "examination of the galaxies with extended radio emission also revealed two interesting candidates for future observation .",
    "j132802 - 314521 is a strong radio source with a luminous core coincident with the galaxy ( @xmath119 w hz@xmath2 ) .",
    "this emission appears to connect to larger - scale diffuse emission , suggesting this source might be another head - tail radio galaxy within the supercluster .",
    "extended radio emission around the galaxy j133048 - 314325 is a potential analog to the well - known system stephan s quintet . in this interpretation , j133051 - 314417",
    "would have interacted with j133048 - 314325 and the nearby spiral j133047 - 314339 .",
    "the resulting radio emission would be the combination of emission from the individual galaxies as well as shocks in the igm .",
    "interestingly , this source is near the peak of the galaxy distribution centered on sc1329 - 313 , suggesting that environmental processes in groups involved with larger - scale mergers may be important for galaxy evolution .",
    "the author thanks an anonymous referee , whose careful reading of the manuscript led to improvements in the clarity of the statistical analysis and additional insight into the extended radio galaxies .",
    "much of this work was completed while i held a national research council associateship at nasa s goddard space flight center .",
    "i also acknowledge the support of nasa through the american astronomical society s small research grant program , which supplied the computing resources to analyze the radio data .",
    "most significantly , this project benefitted greatly from the assistance of michael ledlow .",
    "mike s enthusiastic support of the project included invaluable comments on observing proposals and assistance with the data collection .",
    "i am unable to express enough how sad his passing was , and how great a loss it is to his friends and colleagues .",

    "<S> the core of the shapley supercluster ( a3556 , a3558 , sc1327 - 312 , sc1329 - 313 , and a3562 ) is an ideal region in which to study the effects of cluster mergers on the activity of individual galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents the most comprehensive radio continuum investigation of the region , relying on a 63-pointing mosaic obtained with the very large array yielding an areal coverage of nearly 7 square degrees . </S>",
    "<S> the mosaic provides a typical sensitivity of about 80 @xmath0jy at a resolution of 16 , enabling detection of galaxies with star formation rates as low as 1 m@xmath1 year@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the radio data are complemented by optical imaging in @xmath3 and @xmath4 , producing a catalog of 210 radio - detected galaxies with @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> at least 104 of these radio - detected galaxies are members of the supercluster on the basis of public velocity measurements . across the entire core of the supercluster , there appears to be a significant deficit of radio galaxies at intermediate optical magnitudes ( @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this deficit is offset somewhat by an increase in the frequency with which brighter galaxies ( @xmath8 ) host radio sources . </S>",
    "<S> more dramatic is the highly significant increase in the probability for fainter galaxies ( @xmath9 ) in the vicinity of a3562 and sc1329 - 313 to be associated with radio emission . </S>",
    "<S> the radio and optical data for these sources strongly suggest that these active galaxies are powered by star formation . in conjunction with recent x - ray analysis , </S>",
    "<S> this is interpreted as young starbursts related to the recent merger of sc1329 - 313 with a3562 and the rest of the supercluster . </S>"
