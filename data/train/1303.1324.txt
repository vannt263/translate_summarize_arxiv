    "a few years ago , the tevatron collabroration reported the top forward - backward ( fb ) asymmetry ( @xmath0 ) and since then it has been drawing much interest from high energy physics community .",
    "in addtion to the integrated asymmetry of @xmath1 @xcite there are still around 2-@xmath2 deviation from the standard model calculation . ] , the mass and rapidity dependent asymmetries are also reported and the most recent results are given by the cdf collaboration @xcite .    in the previous publications , we performed the detailed analyses on the integrated asymmetry with the effective lagarangian approach @xcite and also on the rapidity and invariant mass dependent asymmetries @xcite . in this paper , we extend our analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite with updated data , also including the consideration of more general cases and their validities .",
    "if the new physis scale is higher than the energy scale considered , we can adopt the effective lagrangian to describe the low energy phenomena .",
    "since no resonance has been observed at the tevatron energy scale , we adopted the effective lagrangian approach to draw the information on the new physics which might be responsible for top quark @xmath0 .",
    "most generally we can write down the dimension-6 operators for @xmath3  @xcite : @xmath4\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with shorthand notations of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath0 must be expanded with @xmath7 in that case , the fb asymmetry must be written @xmath8 then the deviation from the @xmath9 are expressed as @xmath10 we will use @xmath1 in order to fix the effective couplings and predict the @xmath11 and @xmath12 dependent @xmath0 for those @xmath13 s within @xmath14-@xmath2 range .",
    "we found that @xmath15 and @xmath16 take values between @xmath17 and @xmath18 , see fig .  1 in ref .",
    "@xcite for updated results .",
    "it will be instructive to start this section with old wisdom of electroweak interaction .",
    "the fb asymmetry of the muon pair was measured at petra @xcite , the center of mass energy was far below the @xmath19 pole mass .",
    "one can observe clear fb asymmetry by the parity violating weak interaction , which is absent in qed .",
    "more explicitly , @xmath0 of muon pair far below the @xmath19 mass can be approximated as @xmath20 which is negative definite , a generic feature of the new vector boson with universal couplings to the initial and the final fermions and antifermions .",
    "the petra measurement of @xmath21 in the region far below the @xmath19 pole is that the @xmath22 , which can be translated into @xmath23 compared with the sm prediction : @xmath24 .",
    "note that we can get the rough size of @xmath25 ( or @xmath26 ) only from the interference term between the qed photon and the @xmath19 boson exchanges in the limit @xmath27 ( near threshold ) , if @xmath28 .",
    "similar things can be done for @xmath29 process . in this case with the dimension-6 operator the asymmetry is @xmath30   + \\frac{16 \\hat{s}}{3 m_t^2 }    \\left [ 1 + \\frac{\\hat{s}}{2 \\lambda^2 } ( c_1 + c_2 ) \\right ]   } \\simeq \\frac{3 \\hat{\\beta}_t \\frac{\\hat{s}}{\\lambda^2 }   ( c_1 - c_2 ) } { 8 + 16 \\frac{\\hat{s}}{m_t^2 } } .\\ ] ] in any case , the whole point is that the fb asymmetry near the threshold is approximately linear in @xmath31 modulated by @xmath32 with a small slope parameter that could have either sign depending on @xmath33 , namely the underlying new physics affecting @xmath3 .",
    "now we are in the place to present the numerical results . in the first place",
    ", we consider the case either of @xmath13 is zero .",
    "it is reasonable point in the parameter space since many of the models predict only one of wilson coefficients are nonzero .",
    "see the table(1 ) of ref .",
    "the allowed ranges by the integrated fb asymmetry then become @xmath34 $ ] and @xmath35 $ ] with @xmath36 or @xmath37 is zero for either case .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : afb ] .",
    "one can see that for models that produce nonzero values for either @xmath37 or @xmath36 it is impossible to fit all data altogether .",
    "they fails to generate right behaviors of fb asymmetry as functions of invariant mass and rapidity .",
    "they can not fit the two - bin data either though the points satisfy the integrated asymmetry .",
    "so we can conclude that such models can be excluded if we trust the tevatron observation in the sense that they fail to reconstruct the consistent prediction compared to data .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     next , let us consider the more general case of nonzero values for both @xmath37 and @xmath36 .",
    "we assign the constraint that @xmath38 , which makes no contribution to the cross section .",
    "( [ eq : bsm ] ) ) it is reasonable assumption since the variation of the cross section is smaller than that of @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to that , we further assume that @xmath39 and @xmath40 to minimize the the @xmath41 contribution which spoil the validity of the effective lagrangian approach .",
    "the results are collected in fig.([fig : afb2 ] ) .",
    "unlike the previous results , now we can fit the data .",
    "actually , this parameter set corresponds to usual axigluon models .",
    "as shown in the figure , experimental results are fit in consistent way this time .",
    "interesting point is that this holds for rather larger values of integrated asymmetry . in other words ,",
    "if we restrict the integrated asymmetry in the lower half range of 1-@xmath2 result , then the model can not be accommodated to the observations .",
    "the parameter set which provide the consistent values for all the variables prefers the larger value of integrated asymmetry , roughly @xmath42 $ ] , to the smaller values of integrated asymmetry , namely , @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "the validity of this assertion can be tested if more experimental results are accumulated .",
    "unfortunately it can not be done and we only can tell about rather vague tendency instead of giving strict statements . conservatively speaking , we can assert that the parameter set of @xmath38 fit the data well with preference for the larger value of integrated asymmetry .",
    "final comments are in order",
    ". we should always be careful for treating the problem from the effective lagrangian method . in that case",
    "we should make it sure that the higher order contributions are small enough not to spoil the validity of the nonrenormalizable operators .",
    "for that purpose we estimate the relative size of the @xmath41 over the @xmath9 value .",
    "the ratio goes from @xmath44 up to at most 35@xmath45 of the @xmath9 value in the large invariant mass region , and we can state that the analysis remains robust in most range .",
    "similar behavior takes place in the rapidity dependent asymmetry .",
    "we perform the analyses on the invariant mass and rapidity dependent top forward - backward asymmetries from the effective lagrangian viewpoint . with the non - observation of any new resonances at the tevatron ,",
    "such method is efficient way to extract the new physics information that might be responsible for fb asymmetry .",
    "we show that generically the models that give the nonzero value for only one of @xmath37 and @xmath36 can not reproduce the experimental observations in consistent way in the sense that they fail to fit the slope and two - bin values .",
    "if we relax the constraint and assign the axigluon - like condition as @xmath38 then we can fit the data . even in that case",
    "large integrated fb asymmetry are disfavored .",
    "more study including the lhc data may be necessary to clarify the experimental status of various model in relation with the information extracted by the effective lagrangian approach at the tevatron .",
