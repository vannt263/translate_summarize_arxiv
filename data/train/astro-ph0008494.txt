    "a star lives a luminous life by burning h into successively heavier elements .",
    "however , as the fe group nuclei near mass number @xmath11 are most tightly bound , no more nuclear binding energy can be released to power the star by burning `` fe . ''",
    "therefore , heavy elements beyond `` fe '' have to be made by processes other than normal stellar burning .",
    "one such process is the rapid neutron capture process , or the @xmath3-process for short .",
    "this process is responsible for approximately half the natural abundance of nuclei with mass numbers @xmath12 .",
    "typical @xmath3-process elements are eu , pt , u , and th .",
    "a crude picture for the @xmath3-process is as follows .",
    "one starts with some seed nuclei and lots of neutrons .",
    "the seed nuclei then rapidly capture these neutrons to make very neutron - rich unstable progenitor nuclei .",
    "after neutron capture stops , the progenitor nuclei successively @xmath13-decay towards stability and become the @xmath3-process nuclei observed in nature .",
    "the @xmath3-process has a lot to do with supernova neutrinos .",
    "neutrinos and antineutrinos of all three flavors are emitted by the neutron star produced in a supernova .",
    "the individual neutrino species has approximately the same luminosity but very different average energy .",
    "as the neutrinos diffuse out of the neutron star , they thermally decouple from the neutron star matter at different radii due to the difference in their ability to exchange energy with such matter . with higher temperatures at smaller radii , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and their antineutrinos decoupling at the smallest radii",
    "are imprinted with the highest average energy while @xmath1 decoupling at the largest radii are imprinted with the lowest average energy .",
    "the average energy of @xmath2 lies between those of @xmath4 and @xmath1 .",
    "typical average supernova neutrino energies are @xmath16  mev , @xmath17  mev , and @xmath18  mev .",
    "i emphasize that while different supernova calculations give somewhat different numerical values , there is a robust hierarchy of the average supernova neutrino energies : @xmath19 .",
    "this hierarchy is the most crucial aspect of supernova neutrino emission relevant for our discussion .",
    "a few seconds after the supernova explosion , we have a hot neutron star near the center of the supernova .",
    "the neutron star is still cooling by emitting neutrinos . the shock wave which makes the supernova explosion is far away from the neutron star . on its way out to make the explosion , the shock wave has cleared away almost all the material above the neutron star , leaving behind only a thin atmosphere .",
    "close to the neutron star , the temperature is several mev and the atmosphere is essentially dissociated into neutrons and protons . as the neutrinos emitted by the neutron star free - stream through this atmosphere , some of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 are captured by the neutrons and protons and their energy is deposited in the atmosphere .",
    "in other words , the atmosphere is heated by the neutrinos . as a result",
    ", it expands away from the neutron star and eventually develops into a mass outflow  a neutrino - driven `` wind '' @xcite .",
    "the capture reactions @xmath20 and @xmath21 not only provide heating to drive the wind , but also interconvert neutrons and protons . with a significant excess of @xmath22 over @xmath23 , neutron production by the @xmath2 dominates neutron destruction by the @xmath1 .",
    "consequently , the wind material is neutron rich .",
    "as this material expands away from the neutron star , its temperature and density decrease and various nuclear reactions take place to change its composition .",
    "when the temperature drops to @xmath24  mev , essentially all the protons are assembled into @xmath25-particles and the material at this temperature just contains neutrons and @xmath25-particles .",
    "as the temperature drops further , @xmath25-particles and neutrons are burned into heavier nuclei ( the @xmath25-process @xcite ) . by the time the coulomb barrier stops all charged - particle reactions at a temperature of @xmath26  mev , nuclei with @xmath27 have been produced .",
    "these nuclei then become the seed nuclei to capture the remaining neutrons during the subsequent @xmath3-process , which occurs at temperatures below @xmath26  mev ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an absolutely necessary condition for an @xmath3-process to occur in the neutrino - driven wind is that the wind material must be neutron rich .",
    "as @xmath4 have the highest average energy , significant mixing between @xmath4 and @xmath1 would increase the destruction of neutrons by @xmath1 and drive the wind material proton rich @xcite .",
    "( even in the extreme case of @xmath28 , conversion of @xmath4 into @xmath1 can still drive the wind material proton rich as neutron production by the @xmath2 is hindered while neutron destruction by the @xmath1 is aided by the neutron - proton mass difference . ) for @xmath4 with a cosmologically significant ( vacuum ) mass of @xmath29100 ev , matter - enhanced mixing with a lighter @xmath1 would occur below the region where the neutron - richness of the wind material is determined @xcite .",
    "therefore , such mixing is severely constrained if the @xmath3-process indeed occurs in the neutrino - driven wind in a supernova .",
    "figure [ mix ] shows the parameters for mixing between @xmath4 and @xmath1 that are incompatible with supernova @xmath3-process nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath14-@xmath1 mixing parameters @xmath30@xmath31 at @xmath32 several ev@xmath10 reported by the lsnd experiment @xcite lie in the incompatible region .",
    "thus only the lsnd parameters at @xmath33 several ev@xmath10 are compatible with supernova @xmath3-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "the lsnd parameters at low @xmath34 are also consistent with the results from the karmen experiment @xcite .",
    "one may ask what happens if the lsnd parameters at @xmath32 several ev@xmath10 turn out to be true . in this case ,",
    "supernova @xmath3-process nucleosynthesis can still occur if for example , a light sterile neutrino @xmath6 is introduced so that @xmath4 with the highest average energy will be turned into harmless @xmath6 before they can mix with the @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "of course , one can consider many other possibilities of neutrino mixing that are compatible with supernova @xmath3-process nucleosynthesis . in any case ,",
    "supernova @xmath3-process nucleosynthesis provides a potential probe for mixing between @xmath4/@xmath5 and @xmath35/@xmath36 at the level of @xmath8 for @xmath9  ev@xmath10 . to establish this probe on a solid basis requires us to check the supernova laboratory against the standards of terrestrial experiments .",
    "a terrestrial neutrino oscillation experiment consists of a known neutrino source and a detector with unambiguous signals for neutrino oscillations . in the supernova laboratory ,",
    "the hot neutron star is the neutrino source .",
    "the most crucial aspect of this source is the robust hierarchy of average neutrino energies . as the neutrinos move away from the neutron star",
    ", various scenarios of neutrino mixing can occur .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 emerging from the mixing region are detected by the capture reactions on neutrons and protons , respectively .",
    "the signal that we are looking for is the production of @xmath3-process elements such as eu and u in supernovae .",
    "if this signal is observed , any scenario of neutrino mixing that would cause neutron destruction by the @xmath1 to dominate neutron production by the @xmath2 is forbidden .",
    "note that the use of supernova nucleosynthesis to study forbidden scenarios of neutrino mixing only relies on the _ necessary _ condition for an @xmath3-process to occur in the neutrino - driven wind  the wind material must be neutron rich .",
    "provided that we can prove the supernova origin of the @xmath3-process elements , we do not have to understand the exact details of supernova @xmath3-process nucleosynthesis in order to use the supernova laboratory in the `` forbidden '' mode for studying neutrino mixing . on the other hand ,",
    "if we also know the exact characteristics of supernova neutrino emission and of the neutrino - driven wind , we can even determine whether a certain neutrino mixing scenario is required based on the _ sufficient _ conditions for supernova @xmath3-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "however , great improvements in our understanding of supernovae have to be made before the supernova laboratory can be used in the `` required '' mode for studying neutrino mixing . as the supernova origin of the @xmath3-process elements",
    "is the basis for using supernova nucleosynthesis to study neutrino mixing in either the forbidden or the required mode , it will be the focus of the following discussion .",
    "i first present indirect arguments for the supernova origin of the @xmath3-process elements based on recent observations of @xmath3-process elemental abundances in metal - poor stars and consideration of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "two possible direct tests are discussed next .",
    "the astrophysical site for the @xmath3-process has to provide a large neutron abundance .",
    "this can be achieved by having @xmath2 capture on protons dominate @xmath1 capture on neutrons in a supernova .",
    "alternatively , neutron - rich material may be obtained in the merger of a neutron star with another neutron star or a black hole .",
    "in fact , supernovae and neutron star mergers are considered as the two leading candidate sites for the @xmath3-process .",
    "an important distinction between these two sites is the vast difference in the event rate .",
    "massive stars that explode as supernovae are a small fraction of all stars . the progenitor system for neutron star mergers must have two massive stars in a binary .",
    "furthermore , this binary must survive the two supernova explosions that produce the two compact objects for the eventual merger .",
    "a rather high estimate of the neutron star merger rate in the galaxy is @xmath37 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is still @xmath38 times smaller than the galactic supernova rate .",
    "let us assume that supernovae are the major source for the @xmath3-process and consider @xmath3-process enrichment of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the ejecta from each supernova is mixed with an average mass @xmath39 of ism ( mostly h ) swept up by the supernova remnant ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for a supernova rate that is proportional to the mass of gas , an average ism in the galaxy",
    "is enriched by supernova ejecta at a frequency of @xmath40 , where the supernova rate per unit mass of gas is estimated using @xmath41 and @xmath42 for the present galaxy .",
    "consequently , an average ism would be enriched with a solar @xmath3-process composition ( denoted by the subscript `` @xmath43 '' ) by @xmath38 supernovae over a period of @xmath44  yr .",
    "this then determines the @xmath3-process abundances resulting from a single supernova , e.g. , ( eu / h)@xmath45  ( eu / h)@xmath46 with eu / h being the abundance ratio of eu to h. in the spectroscopic notation @xmath47 , we have @xmath48 @xcite .    the observed eu abundances in many metal - poor stars @xcite are shown in figure [ eu ] .",
    "the `` metallicity '' is defined by [ fe / h ]  @xmath49 .",
    "the low values of [ fe / h ] for the stars indicate that they were formed at very early times when the ism had been enriched by only a small number of supernovae .",
    "the lowest eu abundances observed in metal - poor stars are in agreement with the @xmath3-process enrichment resulting from a single supernova discussed above .",
    "the ejecta from each neutron star merger is mixed with approximately the same amount of ism as swept up by a supernova remnant .",
    "however , as the galactic rate of neutron star mergers is @xmath38 times smaller than that of supernovae , an average ism would be enriched by the ejecta from only @xmath29 neutron star merger over a period of @xmath44  yr .",
    "consequently , the eu abundance resulting from a single event would be @xmath50 if neutron star mergers were the major source for the @xmath3-process .",
    "this is in clear disagreement with the data in figure [ eu ] @xcite .",
    "supernovae also provided fe enrichment of the ism at [ fe / h ]  @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "figure [ eu ] shows that there is a correlation between the abundances of eu and fe at [ fe / h ]  @xmath51 .",
    "this can be explained as the result from mixture of the eu and fe produced by many supernovae if supernovae are the major source for the @xmath3-process . on the other hand ,",
    "an average ism would be enriched in fe by many supernovae between the occurrence of two successive neutron star mergers due to the vast difference in the event rate .",
    "consequently , the correlation between the abundances of eu and fe , especially its early onset at [ fe / h ]  @xmath52 , would be very difficult to explain if eu enrichment were provided by neutron star mergers while fe enrichment was provided by supernovae @xcite .",
    "therefore , consideration of galactic chemical evolution and observations of @xmath3-process elemental abundances in metal - poor stars strongly favor supernovae over neutron star mergers as the major source for the @xmath3-process . furthermore , the total amount of @xmath3-process ejecta required from each supernova to explain the observed @xmath3-process elemental abundances in metal - poor stars is consistent with the amount of material ejected in the neutrino - driven wind @xcite . in summary , there is strong evidence for the supernova origin of the @xmath3-process elements .",
    "as described in the introduction , the @xmath3-process initially produces very neutron - rich unstable progenitor nuclei . during the decay towards stability , some progenitor nuclei decay to the excited states of their daughters",
    "the gamma rays from the de - excitation of the daughters constitute the signal for the presence of these @xmath3-process progenitor nuclei .",
    "if such gamma rays are detected from a future supernova , then we will have proven the supernova origin of the @xmath3-process elements .",
    "a supernova becomes transparent to gamma rays after approximately one year of expansion .",
    "therefore , the relevant @xmath3-process progenitor nuclei must have lifetimes of @xmath53  yr .",
    "three most promising nuclei are @xmath54sb , @xmath55ce , and @xmath56os .",
    "the typical gamma - ray flux from a supernova at a distance of 10 kpc is @xmath57  @xmath58  @xmath59  s@xmath60 @xcite . to detect such fluxes requires a future supernova and a new detector with a sensitivity of @xmath61  @xmath58  @xmath59  s@xmath60 .",
    "therefore , while this is the most direct means to prove @xmath3-process production in supernovae , it is also the hardest .",
    "if we can find suitable @xmath3-process progenitor nuclei with lifetimes much longer than one year , we may search for the decay gamma rays from the remnant of a past supernova .",
    "as a longer lifetime means a smaller decay rate , to ensure a substantial gamma - ray flux requires a nearby supernova remnant ( snr ) .",
    "the vela snr is at a distance of @xmath62  pc .",
    "the age of the pulsar in this snr is @xmath63  yr . the relevant @xmath3-process progenitor nucleus for gamma - ray detection is @xmath64sn with a lifetime of @xmath65  yr and several prominent decay gamma rays .",
    "the expected gamma - ray fluxes due to decay of @xmath64sn in the vela snr are @xmath57  @xmath58  @xmath59  s@xmath60 @xcite .",
    "a new snr near vela was discovered recently through its x - ray emission and the gamma rays from decay of @xmath66ti . as @xmath66ti has a lifetime of only @xmath67  yr",
    ", the age of the new snr is @xmath68  yr . in this case , we can search for decay gamma rays from a number of actinides with lifetimes of @xmath38  yr .",
    "the expected fluxes are again @xmath57  @xmath58  @xmath59  s@xmath60 @xcite .",
    "as we can see , to prove @xmath3-process production in supernovae by gamma - ray astronomy requires a new detector with a sensitivity of @xmath61  @xmath58  @xmath59  s@xmath60 . by comparison ,",
    "the sensitivity of the compton gamma - ray observatory just demissioned was @xmath69  @xmath58  @xmath59  s@xmath60 , and that of the integral experiment to be launched within the next few years is @xmath70  @xmath58  @xmath59  s@xmath60 .",
    "perhaps a sensitivity of @xmath61  @xmath58  @xmath59  s@xmath60 can be reached within the next decade .",
    "there is yet another way to prove @xmath3-process production in supernovae if we take advantage of the occurrence of supernovae in binaries .",
    "approximately half of the stars are in binaries .",
    "some binaries initially consist of a massive star and a low - mass star .",
    "after the massive one explodes as a supernova , it is possible for the neutron star or black hole produced in the supernova to remain in orbit around the low - mass star . furthermore , a fraction of the @xmath3-process ejecta from the supernova would be intercepted by the low - mass star .",
    "therefore , @xmath3-process production in supernovae will be proven if we detect @xmath3-process abundance anomalies on the surface of the binary companion to a neutron star or black hole @xcite .",
    "large overabundances of supernova products such as o , mg , si , and s have been observed recently in the binary companion to a black hole @xcite . with the use of the hubble space telescope and the keck observatory , perhaps this kind of observation can be extended successfully to the @xmath3-process elements within the next few years .",
    "i have discussed the role of neutrinos in heavy element production in supernovae , especially the effects of neutrino mixing on supernova @xmath3-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "the neutron - richness of the material in the neutrino - driven wind in a supernova is sensitive to mixing between @xmath4/@xmath5 and @xmath35/@xmath36 at the level of @xmath8 for @xmath9  ev@xmath10 .",
    "a necessary condition for an @xmath3-process to occur in the wind is that the wind material must be neutron rich .",
    "provided that the supernova origin of the @xmath3-process elements can be proven , this necessary condition can be used to eliminate any scenario of neutrino mixing that would cause neutron destruction by the @xmath1 to dominate neutron production by the @xmath2 .",
    "i have presented indirect arguments for the supernova origin of the @xmath3-process elements based on recent observations of @xmath3-process elemental abundances in metal - poor stars and consideration of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "i have also discussed two direct tests for @xmath3-process production in supernovae : detection of gamma rays due to decay of @xmath3-process progenitor nuclei from a future supernova or nearby supernova remnant and observation of @xmath3-process abundance anomalies on the surface of the binary companion to a neutron star or black hole .",
    "hopefully , these tests will prove the supernova origin of the @xmath3-process elements in the near future , thereby establishing supernova @xmath3-process nucleosynthesis as an extremely sensitive probe for neutrino mixing .",
