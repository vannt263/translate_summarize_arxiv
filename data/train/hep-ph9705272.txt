    "one of important problems in the supersymmetric standard model ( susy - sm ) is how a susy higgs mass term , the @xmath0-term , is derived naturally within the framework of supergravity ( sugra ) . because the @xmath0-term is not a soft susy breaking term and a natural order of such a mass @xmath0 is the gravitational scale @xmath5 in sugra . ] .",
    "this problem is called the @xmath0-problem @xcite",
    ". some types of natural mechanisms of @xmath0-term generation have been proposed , e.g. the case with khler potential including a higgs mixing term @xcite and a superpotential including a suitably suppressed mass term @xcite .",
    "in addition to the supersymmetric mass term , soft susy breaking mass terms also contribute to the higgs mass terms .",
    "explication of susy breaking mechanism is an important and unsolved problem .",
    "superstring theory ( sst ) is only the known candidate for unified theory including gravity and is expected to give a natural solution due to some non - perturbative effects .",
    "recently there have been various remarkable developments in studying non - perturbative aspects of sst @xcite , but susy breaking mechanism has not been fully understood yet . for the present",
    ", we can derive formulae for soft susy breaking terms assuming the existence of nonperturbative superpotential which induces susy breaking in string models @xcite .",
    "further these soft terms can be parametrized simply using several parameters in most cases .",
    "for example , under the assumption that only the dilaton field @xmath6 and/or the overall moduli field @xmath7 trigger susy breaking by their @xmath1-term condensations , soft scalar masses , gaugino masses and @xmath8-parameters are written model - independently by the gravitino mass @xmath9 and the goldstino angle @xmath10 in the case with the vanishing vacuum energy @xcite .",
    "we can extend such a parametrization into cases with several moduli fields @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath11-parameter depends on the @xmath0-term generation mechanisms @xcite .",
    "therefore @xmath0 and @xmath11 parameters are usually treated as arbitrary parameters .",
    "the more arbitrary parameters exist , the harder we analyze and the less we have a predictivity .",
    "it is important to select @xmath0-term generation mechanism in some way .    in this paper , we study several @xmath0-term generation mechanisms based on the radiative breaking scenario of electroweak symmetry breaking within the framework of string theory .",
    "examining the parameter space leading to successful electroweak symmetry breaking , we probe a realistic @xmath0-term generation mechanism . we take into account @xmath2-term contributions to soft scalar masses @xcite in our analysis .- term contribution @xcite and susy grand unified theory ( susy - gut ) with @xmath2-term contributions @xcite . ]",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "string models , in general , have extra gauge symmetries including an anomalous @xmath12 symmetry and extra massless matter fields other than the susy - sm ones .",
    "we can reduce gauge group and massless spectrum through symmetry breaking along flat directions @xcite . as discussed in recent papers @xcite , sizable @xmath2-term contributions can appear through such flat direction breaking .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we give our basic assumptions , formulae of @xmath0-term and @xmath11-term , and our strategy . in section 3 ,",
    "we study several types of @xmath0-term generation mechanisms based on the radiative breaking scenario and show which type is hopeful .",
    "section 4 is devoted to conclusions and discussions .",
    "we take the susy - sm with soft susy breaking parameters expected to be derived as a low - energy theory from orbifold models through flat direction breaking as a starting point of our analysis .",
    "let us first list our basic assumptions .    1 .",
    "the susy is broken by the @xmath1-term condensations of dilaton field @xmath6 and/or moduli fields @xmath13 .",
    "2 .   the vacuum energy @xmath14 vanishes , i.e. , @xmath15 , at the tree level .",
    "3 .   for the third family of the quark doublet @xmath16 , the up - type singlet @xmath17 and the higgs doublet @xmath18",
    ", their modular weights are @xmath19 .",
    "4 .   the top yukawa coupling @xmath20 does not depend on moduli fields , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "the modular weight of the higgs doublet @xmath22 is @xmath23 ( or @xmath24 ) .",
    "the product @xmath25 of higgs doublets is gauge invariant under all gauge symmetries which are broken along a flat direction .",
    "7 .   effects of moduli - dependent threshold corrections for gauge couplings and gaugino masses are negligibly small .",
    "the kac - moody levels satisfy @xmath26 .",
    "the gaugino masses @xmath27 , @xmath11 and @xmath0 are all real . 10 .",
    "the dependence of dilaton and moduli fields is small in the @xmath0-parameter , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "the third and fourth assumptions can be justified from the fact that the coupling @xmath20 is strong and allowed as a renormalized coupling in the untwisted sector .    here",
    "we discuss the overall - moduli case ( @xmath29 ) for simplicity . under the above assumptions ,",
    "we can obtain the following formulae of soft scalar masses @xmath30 , the @xmath8-parameter @xmath31 among @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath18 , and the gaugino mass @xmath34 , @xmath35 where we use the following parameterization @xmath36 here @xmath37 is a @xmath2-term contribution and we get the relation @xmath38 from the assumption 6 and the fact that its contribution is proportional to broken diagonal charges of scalar field .",
    "the natural order of @xmath39 is expected to be @xmath40 from some explicit models @xcite .    in the limit of the moduli dominant susy breaking , we can not neglect moduli - dependent threshold corrections , but we do not consider such a case for simplicity in this paper .",

    "we use the value @xmath46gev as the top quark mass from the current experiments . through our analysis , we take the gauge coupling unification scale @xmath47gev as an energy scale where boundary conditions are imposed . hence it is supposed that the above formulae ( [ smass0])([gmass0 ] ) hold at @xmath48 . by the use of renormalization group equations ( rges ) of the susy - sm @xcite , soft scalar masses of @xmath22 and @xmath18 at the weak scale ( we use the @xmath49-boson mass @xmath50 )",

    "there can be an admixture of several @xmath0-term generation mechanisms and , in this case , @xmath0 and @xmath11 parameters are given as @xmath74 where the indices @xmath75 and @xmath76 run over all @xmath0-term generation mechanisms .",
    "finally we discuss a multi - moduli case briefly .",

    "our strategy , @xmath120bottom - up approach , is more generic and applicable than the usual one , @xmath120top - down approach , where a realization of the radiative breaking scenario is examined by defining the parameters @xmath121 , @xmath0 and @xmath11 at @xmath48 and checking if the quantities renormalized at @xmath50 satisfy stationary conditions ( [ mini1])([mini2 ] ) .",
    "in this section , we examine which type of @xmath0-term generation is hopeful by taking the cases ( @xmath0 - 1)(@xmath0 - 3 ) as examples and comparing @xmath113 and @xmath114 with @xmath115 and @xmath116 determined by @xmath0-term generation mechanism .",
    "we also give remarks of several extensions . for our analysis , it is convenient to define the following functions , @xmath122 the @xmath123 and @xmath124 should be satisfied the conditions @xmath125 and @xmath126 by definition if we assume the radiative breaking of electroweak symmetry and the @xmath75-th type of @xmath0-term generation mechanism .",
    "first we give allowed regions for @xmath113 and @xmath114 in the limit of dilaton dominant susy breaking in fig.1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the ranges of @xmath127 and @xmath128 are @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the ranges of @xmath131 and @xmath132 are @xmath133 and @xmath134 . here",
    "we take @xmath135 , it is necessary to incorporate the contribution of yukawa couplings other than top quark neglected here . ] , @xmath136 and @xmath137gev .",
    "the value @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) corresponds to @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) , @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) and @xmath144 ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "the inequality @xmath137gev is derived from the phenomenological constraint @xmath146gev when @xmath147 .",
    "the fig.3 shows an allowable region of ( @xmath113 , @xmath118 ) in the limit of @xmath148 . in this way , we come to a conclusion that the @xmath0-term generation mechanism can be realistic if the values of @xmath149 and @xmath150 hit the above ranges .",
    "we study the first case ( @xmath0 - 1 ) .",
    "it is shown that there is no region satisfying @xmath151 with @xmath136 from fig.1 and @xmath152 . when @xmath153 , there is a solution of @xmath151 . however , in this case , it is not realistic since the top yukawa coupling blows up below @xmath48 .",
    "this result is consistent with those in ref.@xcite .",
    "further we find no region satisfying @xmath154 with @xmath136 from in fig.2 and @xmath155 .",
    "as discussed in ref.@xcite , @xmath2-term contribution can survive even in the limit of dilaton dominant susy breaking if string model contains an anomalous @xmath12 symmetry which is cancelled by the green - schwarz mechanism @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath2-term contributions related to anomaly - free symmetries vanish at the tree level in the limit of dilaton dominant susy breaking .",
    "if we assume the existence of @xmath2-term contribution , there appears a region consistent with the condition @xmath151 .",
    "however it is a very narrow region with a relatively large positive value of @xmath118 .",
    "for example , the region with @xmath156 and @xmath157 is allowed as given in fig.3 . on the other hand ,",
    "negative @xmath2-term contribution is needed to lower the value of @xmath131 .",
    "hence it is impossible to realize these @xmath0-term generation even with @xmath2-term contribution .    in the second case ( @xmath0 - 2 )",
    ", we get the same result for @xmath11-parameter as the first one . on @xmath0-parameter",
    ", we can estimate the value of @xmath119 using the condition @xmath158 .",
    "hence the radiative breaking scenario can be realized in the models with a relatively large positive @xmath2-term contribution , i.e. , @xmath159 .    in the third case ( @xmath0 - 3 )",
    ", we have a solution even in the absence of @xmath2-term contribution .",
    "the allowable region of ( @xmath160 ) is given in fig.4 .",
    "the favorable value is @xmath161 with @xmath136 .",
    "the introduction of @xmath2-term contribution yields @xmath162 .",
    "the @xmath0-parameter is treated as a free parameter as well as the second one since the origin is unknown .",
    "we consider the effect of overall moduli @xmath1-term condensation .",
    "we have the same qualitative result for @xmath163 as the dilaton dominant case .",
    "that is , there is no allowed region in the first case , but very narrow region exists with large positive @xmath118 in the second case and there exists an allowed region with natural values of ( @xmath9 , @xmath55 , @xmath118 ) in the third case .",
    "the above fact can be understood by the use of the eqs .",
    "( [ mu])([tz ] ) directly",
    ". that is , both @xmath114 and @xmath113 are proportional to @xmath164 in the absence of @xmath2-term contribution and the limit @xmath165 , and so they decrease as @xmath166 increases .",
    "hence it is impossible to satisfy @xmath167 in the first and second case with @xmath136 .",
    "the introduction of @xmath118 does not improve the situation drastically .",
    "we discuss a multi - moduli case ( [ multi - h])([multi - b ] ) .",
    "for the case with @xmath89 and @xmath90 , we have no allowable regions for @xmath167 and @xmath168 because this case corresponds to the first case ( @xmath0 - 1 ) .",
    "we can check that there exists an allowable region with @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "we can carry out the case with @xmath172 .",
    "for @xmath169 and @xmath136 , we find the following fact .",
    "compared with the case with @xmath95 , the value of @xmath127 and @xmath128 decreases and increases , respectively and the absolute value of @xmath114 decreases .",
    "the difference between the values in the case with @xmath95 and @xmath172 increases as @xmath166 increases .",
    "hence the similar conclusion holds for the reality of the radiative breaking scenario as the dilaton dominant case with @xmath95 .    in the case of an admixture of several @xmath0-term generation mechanisms , we need a dominant contribution of the third mechanism ( @xmath0 - 3 ) to get an allowable region with natural values of ( @xmath9 , @xmath103 , @xmath173 , @xmath118 ) .",
    "we discuss the case ( @xmath0 - 4 ) .",
    "as we have an extra light singlet field @xmath71 , the rg flows of @xmath174 and @xmath175 should be modified owing to the effect of the yukawa coupling @xmath176 .",
    "this case can be applied to a similar strategy discussed in the last section .",
    "the difference is that @xmath107 receives rge effects as an @xmath8-parameter above @xmath50 and so we must compare the renormalized quantity with not @xmath11-parameter but @xmath177 at @xmath48 .",
    "it is not discussed here further because the renormalized quantity contains an unknown parameter @xmath176 .",
    "we have given a generic method to select a realistic @xmath0-term generation mechanism based on the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking scenario and studied which type is hopeful within the framework of string theory .",
    "the @xmath0-term generated by some non - perturbative effects , i.e. , ( @xmath0 - 3 ) , can be hopeful to realize the radiative symmetry breaking scenario even in dilaton dominant supersymmetry breaking .",
    "we have discussed effects of the moduli @xmath1-term condensation and @xmath2-term contribution to soft scalar masses . in the case of overall moduli",
    ", we have the same qualitative result as in the limit of dilaton dominant susy breaking , that is , the first mechanism is impossible to realize the radiative scenario , the second one is required to a large @xmath2-term contribution of @xmath178 and the third one is hopeful .",
    "our method to select a realistic @xmath0-term generation mechanism is so generic and powerful that we can apply it to the case with an improvement of approximation and more complex situations .",
    "for example , the improvement by the incorporation of 1-loop effective potential @xcite , the case with a large @xmath55 , the case with large moduli - dominant threshold corrections for gaugino masses , other assignments of modular weight for matter fields and the modular dominant susy breaking case . and",
    "@xmath11 are studied in the multi - moduli case with a large non - universality between higgs masses . ] in the above situations , extra contributions @xmath179 and @xmath180 are added to eqs.([h ] ) and ( [ barh ] ) , respectively .",
    "these studies have to be considered systematically to select a realistic string model .",
