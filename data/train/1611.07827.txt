    "inert doublet model ( idm ) is a special type of the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) that respects a discrete @xmath4 symmetry under which the standard model ( sm ) fields are _ even _ while the inert doublet additional @xmath5 scalar doublet @xmath6 is _ odd _ , therefore the neutral component of @xmath6 could be a dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "only the sm higgs doublet acquires a non - zero vacuum expectation value and hence is a source of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "the inert doublet does not couple with the fermions of the sm .",
    "after ewsb in the scalar sector this model has five physical states : the sm - like higgs boson @xmath7 as well as two charged scalars , @xmath8 , and two neutral ones , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the inert doublet scalars have been studied in @xcite aiming at their mass reconstruction at a linear collider .",
    "a detailed study recently presented in @xcite shows that all inert scalars can well be identified and their masses can be measured up to a reasonable accuracy at a future linear collider .",
    "the observation of inert scalars at the lhc has also attracted attention . for a list of recent works one may refer to @xcite .",
    "these studies have been done mostly based on the production of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 followed by the @xmath15 and @xmath16 assuming @xmath9 as the dark matter candidate . in one of the most recent works in the list ( @xcite ) a di - jet plus missing",
    "transverse energy signature of the inert doublet model events has been studied .",
    "the studied benchmark points ( which are different from ours ) are shown to be observable at a minimum integrated luminosity of 500 fb@xmath17 .",
    "there has been also a study of idm trilepton signals at the lhc in @xcite at an integrated luminosity of 300 fb@xmath17 .",
    "however , the single electroweak gauge boson production ( @xmath18+jets and drell - yan @xmath19+jets ) has not been considered .    in this work",
    ", a scenario is considered in which the scalar @xmath9 is the dark matter candidate , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "we propose a new set of benchmark points which satisfy all the recent experimental and theoretical constraints .",
    "the analysis is performed in two categories : _ di - lepton plus di - jet _ and _ tri - lepton _ final states , all of them produced through @xmath21 at the center of mass energy of 14 tev .",
    "the lepton denoted by @xmath22 is either an electron or a muon .",
    "therefore signal events include both electrons and muons in the final states .",
    "the following processes are considered as the signal in our studies : @xmath23concerning the decay channels , @xmath8 decays to @xmath24 and @xmath10 decays to @xmath25 , however , at all the benchmark points under study , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , therefore those decays can only occur via a virtual @xmath28 and @xmath29 boson . after introducing in [ inert doublet model ] the model and setting up the notations , in [ benchmark points ]",
    "we provide the benchmark points for this study .",
    "the simulation tools used for the analysis described in [ software setup ] . the event generation and the analysis of our benchmark points",
    "are given in [ signal and background processes , signal and background cross sections , event selection and analysis ] .",
    "finally , we discuss and conclude in [ discussion , conclusions ] .",
    "idm is an extension of scalar sector of the sm by addition of a scalar doublet @xmath6 to the sm - like higgs doublet ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the inert doublet is odd under the discrete @xmath4 symmetry , whereas all of the sm fields are even .",
    "the two scalar doublets can be written as , _ s=122g^ + v+h+ig^0 , _",
    "d=122h^ + h+ia , [ higgs_vev ] where @xmath31  gev denotes the vacuum expectation value of the sm - like higgs doublet .",
    "the scalar potential for the idm reads : @xmath32\\notag\\\\ & + \\frac{\\lambda_1}{2}(\\phi_s^\\dagger\\phi_s)^2+\\frac{\\lambda_2}{2}(\\phi_d^\\dagger\\phi_d)^2 + \\lambda_3(\\phi_s^\\dagger\\phi_s)(\\phi_d^\\dagger\\phi_d)\\notag\\\\ & + \\lambda_4(\\phi_s^\\dagger\\phi_d)(\\phi_d^\\dagger\\phi_s ) + \\frac{\\lambda_5}{2}\\big[(\\phi_s^\\dagger\\phi_d)^2+(\\phi_d^\\dagger\\phi_s)^2\\big ] .",
    "\\label{potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the masses and interactions of scalar section are fixed by parameters , ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "after ewsb the physical masses of scalars are expressed as : @xmath34 with @xmath35 defined as , @xmath36 .",
    "the scalar and pseudoscalar mass splitting is related to @xmath37 : m_h^2-m_a^2=_5v^2 note that in order to have the neutral scalar @xmath9 to be the lightest scalar of dark sector one requires @xmath38 , which will be the case in our analysis .",
    "the theoretical and experimental constraints on idm reduce the parameter space considerably . in the following two subsections we outline these constraints and then in the next section we propose our benchmarks points which respect all the following constraints .      we enlist below the theoretical constraints on the idm parameters :    * _ stability _ : the tree level vacuum stability constraints the potential quartic coupling parameters as : _ 10 ,  _ 20 ,  + _ 3>0 ,   + 2_l>0 . *",
    "_ global minimum _ : in order to have a global minimum of the inert potential , we impose the following bound on the mass parameters @xcite : . * _ tree - level unitarity _ : the constraints from the perturbative unitarity of @xmath39 scattering of the vector bosons in the sm is taken into account . * _ perturbativity _ : we also require that all couplings remain perturbative , i.e. we take 4@xmath40 as upper limits .      *",
    "_ sm - like higgs _ : we employ the sm - like higgs boson mass @xmath7 to be @xmath41  gev @xcite and its total width to be @xmath42  mev @xcite . * _ gauge boson width bound _ : the width of the sm gauge bosons w and z put the following constraint on the mass parameter @xcite : @xmath43 * _ dark matter _ : we take into account the following dm searches bounds : * * we consider 2@xmath44 lux2016 experimental direct searches exclusion bound on the dark matter scattering cross section  @xcite . * * we also employ the planck measurement 2@xmath44 limits on dark matter relic density , @xmath45 @xcite . *",
    "_ charged scalar _ : * * lep limit on the charged scalar mass of @xmath46  gev @xcite is taken into account . moreover ,",
    "the exclusion bounds from susy searches at lhc and lep @xcite are also considered .",
    "* * limit on the charged scalar total width , @xmath47  gev , to avoid bounds from long lived charged particle searches @xcite . *",
    "_ ewpo _ : electroweak precision observables ( ewpo ) bound at 2@xmath44 level is also considered  @xcite .",
    "the idm has seven free parameters , out of which two ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) are fixed to get the electroweak vev @xmath31  gev and the sm - like higgs mass @xmath50  gev .",
    "the remaining five parameter @xmath51 can be extracted for the physical parameters namely , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "taking into account all the above mentioned theoretical and experimental bounds , we propose the following benchmark points ( bp ) which have the potential for observation at the lhc .    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "comparing the results of the two analyses , i.e. , the di - lepton plus di - jet channel ( @xmath54 ) and the trilepton channel ( @xmath55 ) , one may realize that the overall shape of the signal distribution is almost the same . however , there is less background in the di - lepton plus di - jet channel and more signal due to the use of the hadronic decay of the @xmath18 boson .",
    "these reasons result in a higher significance .",
    "the @xmath56 background plays the more important role in trilepton analysis .",
    "however , it has less effect in the di - lepton plus di - jet analysis .",
    "the reason is that the signal in di - lepton plus d - ijet channel , has missing transverse energy from the dark matter candidate ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the @xmath56 background should undergo @xmath57 and @xmath58 decays to mimic the signal .",
    "there is no real missing transverse energy in such events and this background is well suppressed by the cut on missing transverse energy .    on the other hand , in the trilepton analysis , the @xmath56 background has to experience @xmath59 and @xmath58 decays which produce a source of missing transverse energy through the @xmath18 leptonic decay .",
    "this feature of @xmath56 background makes it difficult to suppress in the trilepton analysis resulting in a 3@xmath44 evidence of the signal in the best case . in di - lepton plus di - jet channel , bp1 , bp2 and bp3",
    "will be observable at 5@xmath44 at integrated luminosity of 300 fb@xmath17 .",
    "we presented the lhc potential for a dark matter search by introducing an analysis based on inert double model framework .",
    "a new set of benchmark points which respect all experimental and theoretical bounds were introduced as working points .",
    "the analysis was performed at center of mass energy of 14 tev .",
    "two main channels , i.e. , the di - lepton plus di - jet and trilepton channels were analyzed .",
    "results show that distinguishable signals can be obtained at lhc in the di - lepton plus di - jet channel with significances exceeding @xmath60 for 300@xmath3 .",
