    "one dimensional ( 1d ) electron systems can be experimentally realized @xcite and their properties can be measured with increasing precision .",
    "realistic models are very difficult to study and most of the theoretical predictions for such systems ( for some recent experiments see @xcite ) are based on a number of _ conjectures _ , whose mathematical proof is quite hard .",
    "kadanoff @xcite and luther and peschel @xcite proposed that a large class of interacting 1d fermionic systems , quantum spin chains or 2d spin systems belongs to the same universality class .",
    "the critical indices appearing in the correlations are not the same ( on the contrary , the indices depend on all details of the hamiltonian ) , but they verify universal _",
    "extended scaling relations _ between them , with the effect that all indices can be expressed in terms of any one of them .",
    "usually , such hypothesis is formulated by saying that there exists a quantity @xmath0 , whose value depends on the model , such that the critical indices can be expressed by simple universal relations in terms of @xmath0 .",
    "the validity of such relations can be verified in the _ luttinger model _ , which was solved by mattis and lieb @xcite .",
    "haldane @xcite observed that in general even the knowledge of a single exponent is lacking , while the thermodynamic quantities are usually much more accessible , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "he conjectured that certain relations between the parameter @xmath0 and thermodynamical quantities , like the compressibility , are universal properties in a large class of models which he named _ luttinger liquids_. in the case of models which can be analyzed by _",
    "bethe ansatz _ and belonging to such class , the haldane conjecture allows the exact computation of critical indices ; indeed the bethe ansatz by itself allows only the ( partially rigorous ) computation of spectral properties but not of the exponents .",
    "the haldane relations can be verified in the case of the _ luttinger model _",
    ", where the exact solution of @xcite allows to calculate all the spectral quantities and the correlations .",
    "in the case of the xyz spin chain model , whose ground state energy can be computed by the bethe ansatz @xcite , the relations can be verified _ assuming _ the validity of the kadanoff extended relations .",
    "the haldane conjecture , stating that such relations should be valid in a general class of models ( solvable or non - solvable ) has been the subject of an impressive number of studies , see @xcite for a review ; we mention the rg analysis in @xcite ( valid only for the luttinger model ) and the ( heuristic ) probabilistic approach in @xcite .",
    "while such analyses give deep insights , a proof of the conjecture for generic non - solvable models is still lacking .    in recent times , some of the kadanoff relations have been proved in @xcite for several ( solvable and non - solvable ) planar spin models , by rigorous renormalization group methods . in this paper",
    "we will extend such results to prove one of the haldane relations for generic non - solvable lattice fermionic models or quantum spin chains with short range weak interaction . for definiteness ( but our results , as it is evident from the proof ,",
