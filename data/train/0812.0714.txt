    "a standard modeling technique for various complex systems are cellular automata . in fact they are ideally suited for models of diverse phenomena as coffee percolation , highway traffic and oil extraction from porous media .",

    "quantum cellular automata provide model for analyzing quantum computational processes and quantum computational complexity . in his famous paper @xcite",
    ", feynman discusses this idea in order to obtain a model for quantum computing which can be more powerful than a classical computer .",
    "quantum cellular automata also play a role in view of quantum computational complexity .",
    "this aspect has been studied by bernstein and vazirani @xcite by using the concept of quantum turing machines .",
    "watrous ( see e.g. @xcite ) continued this discussion by relating quantum turing machines to quantum cellular automata .",
    "last but not least , there may also be interesting applications besides quantum information theory , for instance , quantum cellular automata could serve as ultra - violet regularized quantum field theories .    in this paper , we are concerned with the `` quantized version '' of cellular automata based on the concepts that are outlined in the article of schumacher and werner @xcite .",
    "in order to motivate the concept for `` quantum '' cellular automata , we briefly review here the idea of reversible classical cellular automata from an algebraic point of view . in this context a complex classical system consists of single cells that are labeled by a countable set @xmath0 . for many applications",
    "this set is given by a regular cubical lattice @xmath1 of dimension @xmath2 . in our later discussion , we restrict our considerations to this case . to each cell @xmath3 a finite set of states @xmath4 is associated , so that the classical configuration space of the total system is given by all functions from @xmath0 into the set @xmath4 .",
    "a further important aspect is concerned with the local action of cellular automata which means that when the automaton is applied , the updated state of a single cell @xmath3 only depends on the states of a finite set @xmath5 of `` neighboring '' cells . in the case of a regular cubic lattice @xmath1 ,",
    "the neighboring scheme is usually chosen to be translationally invariant .",
    "here one takes some finite set @xmath6 and defines the neighbors of a cell @xmath7 according to @xmath8 . in mathematical terms , a reversible classical quantum cellular automata is given a bijective map @xmath9 such that for each @xmath3 there exists a function @xmath10 which satisfies @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 is a function in @xmath13 and @xmath14 denotes the restriction of @xmath12 to the neighborhood @xmath15 .    in the case of a regular lattice structure @xmath1 ,",
    "translation invariance is an additional requirement for the automaton @xmath16 .",
    "the translation group @xmath17 acts naturally on the configuration space @xmath18 according to @xmath19 .",
    "translation invariance for @xmath16 means that @xmath16 commutes with all translations @xmath20 . as a consequence the cellular automaton @xmath16",
    "is completely determined by its `` local rule '' @xmath21 .",
    "namely , the local rule @xmath22 at any cell @xmath7 can be calculated from the local rule @xmath23 at the origin by @xmath24 .    in order to motivate the quantized concept ,",
    "we reformulate the classical quantum cellular automata algebraically . if @xmath4 is a finite set , then the configuration space @xmath13 is compact in the tychonov topology .",
    "the observable algebra of the classical system is given by the abelian c*-algebra of continuous functions @xmath25 which is canonically isomorphic to the tensor product @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the abelian c*-algebra of functions on the single cell configuration space @xmath4 .",
    "in this picture , a reversible cellular automaton @xmath16 induces an automorphism @xmath28 on @xmath25 by the pullback @xmath29 .",
    "the functions in @xmath25 with values in the interval @xmath30 $ ] can be regarded as classical observables .",
    "such an observable is localized in a subset @xmath31 if the corresponding function @xmath32 only depends on the restriction @xmath33 of a classical configuration @xmath12 . with abuse of notation we express this fact as @xmath34 .",
    "thus if we restrict the automorphism @xmath28 to observables that are localized in a single cell @xmath7 the resulting observable is localized in the neighbor hood of @xmath7 .",
    "this can be verified as follows : if an observable @xmath32 is localized at @xmath7 , then the value @xmath35 only depends on @xmath36 .",
    "the application of the automorphism @xmath28 therefore gives @xmath37 , where @xmath22 is the local rule at @xmath7 .",
    "thus the automorphism @xmath28 propagates the localization region of an observable only into its neighboring cells .    the basic idea to quantize the concept of cellular automata is to replace the classical systems by quantum systems , i.e. the abelian c*-algebra @xmath38 is replaced",
    "be a non - abelian one .",
    "the system under consideration is now described by a tensor product @xmath39 where to each cell @xmath7 there is a ( finite dimensional ) c*-algebra @xmath40 associated with .",
    "we require here , that to each cell @xmath7 an isomorphic copy of a fixed c*-algebra is assigned , i.e. @xmath41 . since @xmath0 can be any countable set , we have to deal here with infinite tensor products .",
    "however , this is well defined in terms of the so called inductive limit .",
    "the algebra @xmath42 is usually called the `` quasi - local '' algebra of observables . for each finite subset @xmath43",
    "there is a natural `` local '' subalgebra @xmath44 of the quasi local algebra .",
    "the operators @xmath45 are identified with operators in @xmath46 by filling the remaining tensor positions @xmath47 with the unit operator .",
    "the concept of a reversible quantum cellular automaton is defined as follows :    definition [ def : qca ] a reversible quantum cellular automata ( qca ) is a * -automorphism @xmath28 of the quasi local algebra @xmath42 that fulfills the `` locality condition '' : for each cell @xmath3 and for each operator @xmath48 the operator @xmath49 is localized in the neighborhood of @xmath7 .    as definition  [ def : qca ] indicates , the concept of a qca works for any type of lattice @xmath0 with an appropriate neighborhood scheme where the locality requirement is the essential ingredient . in the subsequent analysis we focus on regular cubic lattices",
    "@xmath1 only .",
    "in this case we have a natural action of the lattice translation group @xmath17 by automorphisms @xmath20 on the quasilocal algebra where @xmath20 is determined by @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "we now consider those qcas that respect the symmetry of lattice translations .    definition [ def : qca_invariant ] a translationally invariant reversible qca is a reversible qca @xmath28 that commutes with the lattice translation group : @xmath52 .    in the subsequent we always refere to the translationally invariant situation .",
    "the translation symmetry can be exploited for the structural analysis of qcas .",
    "in fact , a translationally invariant qca is completely determined by its local rule at the origin .",
    "recall that the local rule @xmath53 at @xmath54 is the restriction of the qca @xmath28 to the algebra @xmath55 .",
    "due to the locality condition , there is a finite subset @xmath6 such that @xmath56 . to be compatible with translation invariance",
    ", the neighborhood scheme can be chosen such that @xmath8 and the `` global rule '' , which is just the automorphism @xmath28 , can be expressed in terms of the local rule @xmath53 by @xmath57 thus a translationally invariant qcas can be described in terms of its local rule only . in particular , if the single cell algebras are finite dimensional , the consruction of the qca is a problem in finite dimensions .",
    "a strategy for constructing a qca is based on finding a valid local rule .",
    "one has to choose a * -homomorphism @xmath58 and has to check the commutator condition @xmath59=0 $ ] for all @xmath60 and for all @xmath3 with @xmath61 .",
    "assuming that the single cell algebra @xmath55 is finite dimensional , there are only finitely many conditions to be tested . for a comprehensive review on this issue , we refere here to the work of schumacher and werner @xcite .    although there are only finitely many conditions to check , a general systematic classification of qcas is a highly non - trivial and still unsolved task .",
    "but there are particular classes of qcas for which a complete and explicit classification is possible , as the class of clifford ( or quasifree ) quantum cellular automata which we review here in the following .",
    "the results that we are presenting here are based on our previous article @xcite .",
    "to explain the concept of clifford quantum cellular , we consider a regular cubic lattice @xmath17 .",
    "to each cell we associate a full matrix algebra @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a prime number .",
    "moreover we choose a basis of weyl operators in @xmath64 .",
    "these operators are generalizations of the pauli operators and are constructed by shift and multiplier unitaries . to be more precise , we consider an orthonormal basis @xmath65 of the hilbert space @xmath66 that is labled by elements @xmath12 of the finite field @xmath67 .",
    "one way to define the weyl operators is to determine its action on the basis @xmath65 according to @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the @xmath63th root of unity . as a consequence ,",
    "the weyl operators fulfill the relation @xmath70 which shows that the weyl operators form a unitary projective representation of the additive group @xmath71 .    for the special case @xmath72 , which corresponds to qubits , the corresponding weyl operators are related to the pauli matrices @xmath73 by @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we are now concerned with the quasi local algebra @xmath42 which is given by the infinite tensor product of single cell algebras @xmath62 over the regular lattice @xmath17 .",
    "the weyl operators for the infinite system are given by tensor products @xmath77 where the `` phase space '' vector @xmath78 is a function from the lattice @xmath17 to the vector space @xmath79 with finite support .",
    "note that the finite support condition guarantees that only finitely many tensor factors are different from the identity which implies that @xmath80 is a well defined unitary operator that belongs to quasilocal algebra .",
    "moreover , the complex linear hull of the weyl operators is norm dense subalgebra of @xmath42 .",
    "i this sense , the weyl operators form a `` basis '' for the quasi local algebra .    obviously , the weyl operators of the infinite system fulfill the relation @xmath81 which implies the commutation relation @xmath82 note that the symplectic form @xmath83 for the infinite system is well defined since it is evaluated only for function with finite support .",
    "this relations justifies to interprete the functions @xmath78 as vectors in a discrete phase space  denoted by @xmath84 in the following  with symplectic form @xmath83 .",
    "we are now prepared to give a precise definition of clifford quantum cellular automata .",
    "definition a clifford quantum cellular automata ( cqca ) @xmath28 is a translationally invariant reversible qca which maps weyl operators to multiples of weyl operators .",
    "thus there exists a function @xmath85 as well as a phase - valued function @xmath86 such that @xmath87 holds for all phase space vectors @xmath78 .",
    "a simple cqca is given by lattice translations .",
    "the lattice translations act on the phase space vectors @xmath78 by just translating the function @xmath88 . with abuse of notation",
    "we use the same symbol for the action on phase space as for the action on the quasilocal algebra . by construction",
    "the covariance relation @xmath89 follows immediately .",
    "hence , the lattice translations @xmath20 are cqcas in the sense of the definition given above .",
    "as we will see , the translation invariance together with the condition to map weyl operators to multiple of weyl operators is sufficient to determine a cqca .",
    "this means , that the locality is a consequence of these conditions . to deal with the translation symmetry in an appropriate way",
    ", we identify the phase space @xmath90 as a two dimensional module over the ring @xmath91 of functions from the lattice @xmath17 into the finite field @xmath71 having finite support . the multiplication in the ring is the convolution of functions which is given by @xmath92 we are now prepared to state the first structure theorem on cqcas .",
    "we refere here the reader to our article @xcite for a complete discussion of the proof in which uses techniques from the theory of projective representations of symplectic abelian groups ( see e.g. @xcite ) as well as results from the theory of covariant completely positive maps @xcite .",
    "theorem for each cqca @xmath28 , there exists a two - by - two matrix @xmath93 with entrees in the ring @xmath91 and a translationally invariant phase valued function @xmath94 such that @xmath95 and @xmath96 fulfills the cocycle condition @xmath97 moreover , the map @xmath98 preserves the symplectic form @xmath83 , i.e. @xmath99 .",
    "we sketch here just the basic idea of the proof : it follows from the weyl relations that each automorphism @xmath28 that maps weyl operator to multiples of weyl operators according to ( [ eq : cliff ] ) induces a @xmath71-linear map @xmath100 on phase space that preserves the symplectic form .",
    "moreover , the condition to be an automorphism implies that the phase valued function @xmath96 fulfills ( [ eq : cocycle ] ) where , for this moment , we have to repace the operator @xmath98 by @xmath100 .    by taking advantage of the translation invariance ,",
    "the phase valued function @xmath96 is translationally invariant and the symplectic map @xmath100 commutes with the lattice translations , it follows that @xmath100 is given by the convolution @xmath98 with a matrix - valued function with finite support .",
    "note that a two - by - two matrix @xmath101 with entries in the ring @xmath91 can equivalently be seen as a function that maps a lattice site @xmath102 to a two - by - two matrix with entries in the finite field @xmath71 .",
    "the convolution with a phase space @xmath78 vector is given by @xmath103 where @xmath104 is usual matrix multiplication .",
    "the localization region of a weyl operator @xmath80 is just the support of the function @xmath78 . if the support of @xmath78 is just a single site @xmath7 , then @xmath105 has support in @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the support of @xmath101 . therefore , the application of the corresponding cqca yields an operator @xmath108 which is localized in @xmath106 . as a consequence",
    ", the support of @xmath101 determines the neighborhood scheme of the qca .",
    "we also shown in @xcite that each matrix - valued function @xmath101 for which the convolution @xmath98 preserves the symplectic form @xmath83 a phase valued function @xmath96 can be found , such that the equation ( [ eq : cqca ] ) defines a cqca .",
    "therefore , the classification of cqcas is equivalent to characterize all two - by - two matrices @xmath109 with entries in the ring",
    "@xmath91 whose convolution @xmath98 is symplectic . in accordance with @xcite",
    ", we call the convolution @xmath98 a `` symplectic cellular automaton ( sca ) '' .",
    "for the further analysis of cqcas , we have a closer look at the ring and module structure of the phase space @xmath110 .",
    "as already mentioned @xmath84 is a two dimensional module over the ring @xmath91 where the product is the convolution .",
    "a function @xmath111 acts on a phase space vector by @xmath112 .",
    "a symplectic cellular automaton ( sca ) , which induces a cqca , is then a module homomorphism .",
    "namely , since the convolution in @xmath91 is commutative , we observe that @xmath113 .    to take advantage of the translation symmetry in an appropriate manner , we have introduced the `` algebraic fourier transform '' , which identifies the ring @xmath91 with the commutative ring of laurent polynomials @xmath114\\ ] ] generated by the variables @xmath115 and its inverses @xmath116 . for a function @xmath111 the corresponding laurent - polynomial is simply given by @xmath117 where we write @xmath118 for a handy notation . to view the elements in @xmath91 as formalpolynomials ,",
    "gives us a convenient book - keeping at hand .",
    "namely , the convolution turns into a product of polynomials , i.e. for two functions the identity @xmath119 holds .",
    "we mention here that the ring @xmath120 is a `` divison ring '' which means that @xmath121 implies that either @xmath122 or @xmath123 .",
    "morover , the only invertible elements in @xmath120 are the monomials @xmath124 with @xmath102 .    with help of this ring isomorphism @xmath125 , the phase space can be identified with @xmath126 and , since a sca is a module homomorphism , its fourier transform just acts by matrix multiplication . to be more precise ,",
    "a sqca is given by a two - by - two matrix @xmath127 with entries in the polynom ring @xmath120 acting on a phase space vector by @xmath128    after applying the algebraic fourier transform , the symplectic form is a @xmath120-valued bilinear from @xmath129 on @xmath130 that can be calculated according to @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the involution on the ring @xmath120 which replaces in the polynomial @xmath133 the variable @xmath134 by its inverse @xmath135 . in the lattice space",
    ", this corresponds to a reflection at the origin .",
    "the form @xmath129 is related to the underlying symplectic form @xmath83 by @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the inverse algebraic fourier transform sending a polynomial @xmath32 to a function @xmath138 on the lattice .",
    "it is not difficult to observe , that @xmath129 is a module homomorphism in the second argument , i.e. @xmath139 and that it fulfills the relation @xmath140 .",
    "thus @xmath129 is antisymmetric for reflection invariant polynomials . in this context ,",
    "a helpful lemma for the characterization of scas is the following :    lemma a two - by - two matrix @xmath141 with entries in the polynom ring @xmath142 is a symplectic cellular automaton , if and only if , it preserves the form @xmath129 , i.e. the identity @xmath143 holds .",
    "according to this lemma , the characterization of cqcas ( hence scas ) reduces to the problem of finding two - by - two matrices with entries in the ring @xmath120 which preserve @xmath129 . since we deal here with module homomorphism",
    " a linear structure over the ring @xmath120  we have reduced a problem in infinitely many degrees of freedom to an effectively two - dimensional problem .",
    "there is an important subring in @xmath120 , which we denote here by @xmath144,which consists of all polynomials that are invariant under the reflection @xmath145 which means @xmath146 .",
    "for @xmath147 , the corresponding function @xmath138 in lattice space is then given by a palindrome string @xmath148 starting at the left boundary of the support @xmath149 and ending at the right boundary @xmath150 .",
    "for this reason , we call @xmath144 the polynom subring of palindromes in @xmath120 . if we look at the properties of the form , @xmath129 , we see that it is a non - degenerate antisymmetric @xmath144-bilinear form on @xmath151 . in analogy , that the symplectic group of @xmath152 is given by the special linear group @xmath153 a first guess is , that the group of sca is given by all two - by - two matrices with entries in the palindrome subring @xmath144 having ring - valued determinant equal to one . indeed ,",
    "if we choose a matrix @xmath154 , then we observe by a straight forward calculation that @xmath101 preserves the form @xmath129 .",
    "if we multiply @xmath101 with a monomial @xmath155 , which corresponds to a lattice translation by @xmath156 , then we observe that @xmath157 .",
    "thus if @xmath101 is a sca then @xmath158 is a sca too .",
    "indeed , all scas are of this type . the precise statement",
    "which we have established in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  3.4 ) is the following :    theorem [ thm : main ] the group of clifford quantum cellular automata acting on a @xmath2-dimensional lattice with single cell algebras @xmath64 is isomorphic to the direct product @xmath159 of the lattice translation group and the special linear group of two - by - two matrices with entries in in the palindrome subring @xmath144 .",
    "this theorem can be used to build up a simple cooking recipe for constructing cqcas .",
    "firstly , take two palindromes @xmath160 . recall that palindromes are easy to get .",
    "namely , for the case that @xmath161 is not a palindrome you just make one by taking @xmath162 . secondly , factorize the polynomial @xmath163 in the subring @xmath144 into two palindromes @xmath164 .",
    "finally , you get your cqca by building the matrix @xmath165 for this type of recipe , to find all possible factorizations of the polynomial @xmath166 is the crucial problem which can be quite cumbersome . however , there is allways the trivial solution which is given by @xmath167 and @xmath168 .    concerning the factorization problem , at least for a one dimensional lattice @xmath147",
    "the situation can be tackled .",
    "here one takes advantage of the fact that the ring @xmath169 is a so called `` euclidean ring '' ( see e.g. @xcite ) and an extended euclidean algorithm for finding greatest common divisors can be applied .",
    "this yields in an even stronger classification result of one - dimensional cqcas than provided by the dimension independent theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "we have shown the following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.11 ) :    theorem [ thm : one - dim ] every clifford quantum cellular automata @xmath101 acting on a one dimensional lattice with single cell algebras @xmath64 can be factorized into a product of a unique shift @xmath155 and elementary cqcas of the following two types : the first type is a shear transformation @xmath170 depending on an integer @xmath171 .",
    "the second type depends on a constant @xmath172 according to @xmath173    the automata @xmath174 are constant matrix valued polynomials which implies that they act on each lattice site independently .",
    "the have zero propagation speed since their neighborhood scheme only consits of the origin .",
    "on the other hand the propagation of the localization region of an observable is induced by the shear automata @xmath175 .",
    "their local rule propagate from the origin into the cells @xmath176 .",
    "in this note , we have discussed some aspects on the structure of quantum cellular automata where we have mainly focused on our results on clifford quantum cellular automata @xcite .",
    "we have characterized the group of cqcas in terms of symplectic cellular automata on a suitable phase space . with the help of the concept of algebraic fourier transform ,",
    "this phase space can be identified with two - dimensional vectors of laurent - polynomials , and symplectic cellular automata can be described by two - by - two matrices with laurent - polynomial entries .",
    "we have reported that these entries must be reflection invariant and that up to some global shift the determinant of the matrix must be one , so the group of cqcas is isomorphic to the direct product of the lattice translation group with the special linear group of two - by - two matrices with reflection invariant polynomials as matrix elements .",
    "besides the core results , that we have presented here , there is a correspondence between 1d cqcas and 1d translationally invariant stabilizer ( graph ) states ( see e.g. @xcite for the notion of stabilizer ( graph ) states ) . for a fixed translationally invariant pure stabilizer state , which is in particular a product state ,",
    "every other translationally invariant pure stabilizer state can be created by applying an appropriate cqca .",
    "a further natural question is concerned with lattices with periodic boundary conditions . here",
    "the techniques from infinitely extended lattices can be applied to a certain extend .",
