    "in recent years there has been much progress in working with branes in landau - ginzburg models , in the framework of matrix factorizations .",
    "this approach was first proposed by m. kontsevich and was later introduced in the physics literature in @xcite .    in the simplest form ,",
    "the idea is that the branes that preserve b - type supersymmetry can be classified by factorizations of the landau - ginzburg superpotential invoving matrices of arbitrary rank .",
    "moreover , all correlators involving bulk and boundary chiral ring elements can be computed through a relatively simple procedure from the data of the factorization @xcite .",
    "the landau - ginzburg models that describe the tensor product of @xmath2 minimal models have been studied with particular attention and all the boundary states known for minimal models have been mapped to matrix factorizations of the corresponding landau - ginzburg potentials @xcite . moreover , the lg classification of b - branes has served as useful guidance in the study of minimal models : this has been the case , for example , for the construction of boundary states corresponding to permutation branes @xcite .",
    "b - branes in landau - ginzburg orbifolds were briefly discussed in @xcite and were more systematically studied in @xcite .",
    "later , @xcite filled in some gaps and proposed a formula for boundary correlators in orbifold models , generalizing the results of @xcite .",
    "essentially , if the lg model is orbifolded , in addition to a factorization of the superpotential one needs to specify a representation of the orbifold group .",
    "the spectrum is then computed by solving some equivariance equations that implement the orbifold projection . however , although the formalism is quite general , the explicit examples considered in the physics literature have been mostly restricted to landau - ginzburg orbifolds that describe gepner models .",
    "this class of examples is especially interesting , because not only is there vast availability of solid results on the cft side , but these are also the models relevant for the landau - ginzburg / calabi - yau correspondence @xcite and several examples of mirror symmetry @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to analyze explicitly a few examples of landau - ginzburg orbifolds that do not correspond to gepner models .",
    "mostly , we will consider non - abelian orbifolds , single out some class of factorizations - and representations of the orbifold group - and compute the spectrum of boundary operators for these factorizations .",
    "the general technology to do this is already in place , as mentioned above .",
    "the only new element here is perhaps the prescription to construct fractional branes .",
    "this is already implicit in the earlier work on @xmath3 orbifolds , but when considering non - abelian orbifold groups is becomes necessary to give a more systematic prescription to choose the representations associated to a given matrix factorization .",
    "we will restrict our analysis to representations of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the irreducible representations of the orbifold group and @xmath6 is a ( generally reducible ) representation that depends on the choice of factorization .",
    "this choice proves to be useful computationally , as most computations can be reduced to equations for matrices of the same size as @xmath5 instead of @xmath7 .",
    "this simplification is one of the main results of the paper .",
    "we will not discuss here any applications or comparisons with other models , but there are a few directions that it might be worth exploring .",
    "some that come to mind are : boundary states for non - abelian orbifolds of minimal models ; mirror symmetry for non - abelian landau - ginburg models ; branes in permutation orbifolds of calabi - yau compactifications .",
    "we hope to investigate some of these applications of the present work in the future .",
    "in section [ general ] we review some general facts about matrix factorizations and set up the notation and conventions used in the rest of the paper .",
    "we focus in particular on landau - ginburg orbifolds , and discuss the construction of fractional branes in these models .",
    "we also review the tensor product construction of factorizations and boundary operators introduced in @xcite , which is crucial in carrying out most of the computations in this paper . in section [ s2ex ] we analyze in detail the orbifold @xmath8 .",
    "although this is a very simple and abelian orbifold , it contains many elements that return in more complex cases and it is therefore a good warm - up example . in section [ s3ex ]",
    "we consider the orbifold @xmath9 . here",
    "we focus on a specific factorization and construct an orbit of fractional branes .",
    "we also show how the computation of the spectrum can be conceptually simplified and reduced to a few simple equations .",
    "the explicit results in matrix form are collected in the appendix , both for completeness and comparison with the simple form of the answer obtained in the main text . in section [ dnex ]",
    "we study our last example , the orbifold @xmath10 .",
