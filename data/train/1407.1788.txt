    "almost every type of pulsating star has been found as a component in an eclipsing binary system .",

    "we present the analysis of an eclipsing binary with a pulsating component discovered in the _ kepler _ dataset .",
    "kic8560861 ( hd183648 ) is a relatively long - period ( @xmath11d ) , marginally eccentric ( @xmath12 ) eclipsing binary system which exhibits mmag pulsations with periods on the order of a few days .",

    ": tidaloscillation ] we discuss the characteristics and the possible tidal origin of the detected oscillations .",
    "the photometric analysis is based on photometry from the _ kepler _ space telescope @xcite .",
    "hd183648 was observed both in long and short cadence mode between 2009 and 2013 .",
    "the long cadence ( time resolution of 29.4min ) dataset covers nearly the whole length of kepler s 4-y life - time ( quarters 0  16 ) , while it was observed for only 30d in q3.2 in short cadence ( time resolution of 58.9s ) mode .",
    "the mast database indicates @xmath21percent contamination , depending on the quarter in question .",
    "we have downloaded the target pixel files for all quarters and performed several checks by using pyke tools .",
    "first , we verified that all signals come from one object ; that is , no contamination is seen from a close - by blended object within kepler s resolution ( 4arcsec ) .",
    "this was done by examining the amplitude of the ( visible ) signals in individual pixels .",
    "any signal coming from a different source would be revealed by a displaced pixel showing a higher amplitude of that signal .",
    "we also checked that no signal was lost due to the assigned target aperture mask . due to the brightness of the star and saturation on the _ kepler _ photometer ,",
    "the target aperture mask was elongated .",
    "along the elongation axis , we still detect signal from the star , and we assume the flux could be still detected in pixels outside the target aperture .",
    "however , we have determined that the contribution of these peripheral pixels outside of the target aperture is negligible .",
    "we estimate that the lost flux from the star is less than 0.01percent .",
    "we obtained high and medium resolution spectra at five observatories .",
    "we took 2 spectra in 2010 at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) , usa , using the echelle spectrograph at the mayall 4-meter telescope with a resolution of @xmath22 in the spectral range @xmath23 .",
    "34 spectra were taken on 11 nights in 2012 with the eshel spectrograph mounted on a 0.5-m ritchey - chrtien telescope at the gothard astronomical observatory ( gao ) , szombathely , hungary , in the spectral range @xmath24  with a resolution of @xmath25 .",
    "the wavelength calibration was done using a thar lamp .",
    "the same instrument was used at piszkstet observatory ( po ) , hungary mounted on the 1-m telescope , where we took 36 spectra on 16 nights in 2012 and 2013 .",
    "a detailed description of the instrument can be found in @xcite .",
    "we obtained 5 spectra at apache point observatory ( apo ) , usa , using the arces echelle spectrograph on the 3.5  m telescope with a resolution of @xmath26 in the spectral range @xmath27 .",

    "the presence of oscillations at integer harmonics of the orbital frequency is not surprising .",
    "as described above , these oscillations are produced by a combination of tidal ellipsoidal effects , reflection effects , and doppler beaming ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in a circular orbit , the reflection and doppler beaming effects contribute mainly to variation at @xmath31 , while the tidal effect contributes mainly to variation at @xmath32 .",
    "for an eccentric orbit , each of these effects contributes variations at every harmonic of the orbital frequency ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in hd183648",
    ", the low eccentricity implies that these effects only contribute at low harmonics of the orbital frequency .",
    "indeed , we only observe modulation at @xmath31 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 . in what follows",
    ", we assume all modulation arises from the primary since its light dominates the luminosity of the system .    the especially odd feature of hd183648 is the phase of the oscillation at @xmath33 .",
    "in typical nearly circular eclipsing binaries which show ellipsoidal variations , the eclipses occur near the minima of the ellipsoidal modulations , while the maxima occur one quarter of an orbital period later .",
    "the phase of this modulation is intuitive : the maxima occur away from eclipse when the equilibrium tidal distortion , @xmath35 components . ]",
    "causes the star to present a larger surface area toward the line of sight .",
    "however , in hd183648 , the oscillation at @xmath33 shows the opposite phase , with maxima near the eclipses ( phases 0 and 0.5 ) .",
    "there are three possible explanations for the strange features of the oscillations at orbital harmonics in hd183648 .",
    "the first is that non - adiabatic effects near the surface of the star are strongly affecting the temperature perturbation created by the equilibrium tidal distortion of the primary star .",
    "tidal ellipsoidal variations are typically modelled by using von zeipel s theorem to calculate the surface temperature perturbations . in this case , the tidally depressed regions ( where the surface gravity is stronger ) are hotter , creating a luminosity fluctuation of the same phase as described above ( i.e. , the luminosity maxima occur away from eclipses ) .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , non - adiabatic effects can completely alter the temperature perturbations in hot stars with radiative envelopes like the primary in hd183648 . for hot stars ,",
    "the luminosity variation is typically dominated by temperature variations ( rather than surface area distortion ) , and the phase of this variation can be arbitrary .",
    "therefore , non - adiabatic effects may be strongly altering the luminosity variations produced by the equilibrium tidal distortion of hd183648 , leading to the strange phase of the oscillation at @xmath32 .",
    "a second explanation is that dynamical tidal effects are important . in stars with radiative envelopes ,",
    "dynamical tides are composed of stellar gmodes that are nearly resonant with the tidal forcing frequencies .",
    "as with the equilibrium tide , the dynamical tide produces observable oscillations at exact integer harmonics of the orbital frequency @xcite .",
    "the phase of the luminosity fluctuations produced by dynamical tides can be different from that of the equilibrium tidal distortion ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , potentially creating the observed oscillations .",
    "however , in most cases the luminosity oscillations produced by the dynamical tide are smaller than that of the equilibrium tide ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so a gmode unusually close to resonance may be needed to produce the oscillation at @xmath32 .",
    "a third possibility is that non - linear interactions are affecting the mode phases and amplitudes .",
    "we discuss this in greater detail below .",
    "a full calculation of tidal excitation of non - adiabatic oscillation modes in rotating stars is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "instead , we simply calculate the expected luminosity fluctuation and phase of the adiabatic equilibrium tidal distortion , using the stellar parameters of table[tab : syntheticfit ] .",
    "the tidal distortion causes luminosity fluctuations of form @xmath36 where the integer @xmath37 is the orbital harmonic of the oscillation , @xmath38 is its amplitude , and @xmath39 is its phase relative to periastron when @xmath40 .",
    "we calculate the amplitude of the equilibrium tide as described in @xcite , using von zeipel s theorem to calculate the flux perturbation .",
    "we also calculate the expected phase of the equilibrium tide luminosity fluctuation , which is depending on whether the amplitude @xmath38 is positive or negative , which in turn depends upon , e.g. , the sign of the hansen coefficients used to calculate the tidal potential for eccentric orbits ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we calculate these coefficients , and adjust the phase @xmath41 such that the amplitude @xmath38 is positive . ]",
    "@xmath42 where @xmath43 is the argument of periastron listed in table[tab : syntheticfit ] .",
    "we plot these results in fig.[kic85plot ] .",
    "it is evident that although the magnitude of the observed luminosity fluctuations are similar to those expected from an adiabatic equilibrium tide , the phases are completely different .",
    "hopefully , a more in depth investigation of tidally excited oscillations in this system will provide constraints on the tidal dynamics at play .",
    "top : observed luminosity fluctuations and luminosity fluctuations due to the equilibrium tidal distortion ( calculated using von zeipel s theorem ) as a function of the orbital harmonic @xmath44 .",
    "bottom : observed cosine phase of the luminosity fluctuations and the expected phase for the equilibrium tide . although the observed oscillation amplitude at @xmath45 is near the expected equilibrium tide amplitude , it is out of phase from the expected equilibrium tide phase . ]    finally , we emphasize that it is important to consider the rapid rotation frequency of the primary in hd183648 relative to the orbital frequency .",
    "if the primary s spin axis is aligned with the orbit , the stellar rotation period is about 1.6d , implying the rotation frequency is @xmath46 . in this scenario , the observed gmodes ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) can not be prograde modes ( in the rotating frame of the star ) because their minimum frequency in the inertial frame is @xmath49 .",
    "moreover , the tidally excited oscillations are retrograde oscillations in the rotating frame of the primary ( although they are prograde in the inertial frame ) .",
    "note that in the rotating frame , the tidal forcing frequencies are @xmath50 . since @xmath51",
    "the absolute values of the forcing frequencies are much larger in the rotating frame , allowing for excitation of gmodes with frequencies ( in the rotating frame ) @xmath52 .",
    "as described above , the dominant two oscillation frequencies @xmath47 and @xmath48 are separated by exactly @xmath32 , which is the third largest amplitude oscillation observed .",
    "it is well known that combination frequencies of this sort are indicative of non - linear mode coupling ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , there are now many cases of combination frequencies in close binaries which appear to be caused by non - linear mode coupling with tidally excited modes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of hd183648 , the non - linear coupling causes interactions between two gmodes ( corresponding to @xmath47 and @xmath48 in table[freqs ] ) and a tidally excited oscillation at @xmath32 .",
    "at least one of the gmodes may be self - excited , perhaps because one of the stars is a @xmath53dor variable .",
    "indeed , the primary of hd183648 lies near the hot end of the @xmath53dor instability strip , while the secondary lies near the cool end .",
    "the observed frequencies @xmath47 and @xmath48 are on the low side , but are compatible with @xmath53dor pulsations @xcite .",
    "the primary also lies within the @xmath54-scuti instability strip , although no p - modes are observed .",
    "the tidally excited oscillation is either composed of the equilibrium tide ( which is dominated by the @xmath55 , @xmath56 fmodes ) or the dynamical tide ( which is dominated by an @xmath57 gmode ) .",
    "the modes interact via a parametric resonance , redistributing energy amongst the three modes .",
    "this transfer of energy changes the phases of the observed oscillations , and it may be possible that this is affecting the phase of the @xmath32 oscillation .",
    "it is also possible that @xmath47 and @xmath48 are not self - excited modes , but instead are non - linearly tidally driven modes .",
    "the signature of non - linear tidal excitation is that @xmath58 where @xmath37 is an integer ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in hd183648 , @xmath59 ,",
    "which is compatible with non - linear excitation of @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( although this does not explain the large amplitude of @xmath60 ) .",
    "non - linear tidal driving was observed in a similar system examined by @xcite .",
    "we have presented a complex photometric and spectroscopic analysis of hd183648 , a marginally eccentric ( @xmath12 ) , wide ( @xmath61 ) , detached eclipsing binary system with a low amplitude pulsating component .",
    "the photometric analysis of the extremely accurate _ kepler _",
    "q16 long cadence photometry incorporated disentangling of the eclipse and pulsation features , an eclipsing light curve solution and extended orbital period study via an etv analysis .",
    "the spectroscopic investigations were based on ground - based high- and medium resolution spectra obtained with various instruments ( echelle spectrograph at kpno , arces echelle spectrograph at apo , hamilton echelle spectrograph at lick observatory , and eshel spectrograph of gao , mounted on two telescopes at szombathely and piszkstet , in hungary ) between 2011 and 2013 . the spectroscopic data were mainly used for radial velocity analysis and for determination of stellar atmospheric properties and evolutionary states .",
    "furthermore , the spectral disentangling technique made it also possible to detect the spectral lines of the secondary star despite its small ( less than 5% ) contribution to the total light of the system .",
    "this fact allowed us to calculate dynamical masses and hence , relatively accurate stellar parameters .",
    "however , we emphasize that all of the various investigations were carried out in a complex and interdependent manner .",
    "namely , the results and constraints of the radial velocity and etv analysis were incorporated in the light curve analysis and vice versa , in an iterative manner ; similarly , the quantitative spectral analysis was constrained at the same time by the outputs of the light curve analysis . in this way we were able to find a solution consistent with both the observations and the theoretical constraints .",
    "we found that the binary is composed of two main sequence stars with an age of @xmath2gyr , having fundamental parameters of @xmath62m@xmath4 , @xmath63r@xmath4 for the primary , and @xmath64m@xmath4 , @xmath65r@xmath4 for the secondary .",
    "both stars were found to be rapid rotators with @xmath66kms@xmath67 and @xmath68kms@xmath67 which in the aligned case correspond to rotation periods @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .    we have found various types of eclipse timing variations in our analysis .",
    "we showed that the short time scale ( @xmath71d ) periodic variation is a false positive due to an apparent beating between orbital and pulsational frequencies .",
    "the parabolic variation , which indicates a period increase with a constant rate , however , is suggested to be a real effect .",
    "the most plausible explanation is presence of an additional , distant , third body in the system .",
    "clear indicators of apsidal motion have been found as well .",
    "we found a significant discrepancy between the theoretically computed and observed apsidal advance rates .",
    "this can be explained either with the insufficiently short time coverage of the apsidal motion cycle , which has a period of the order of ten thousand years , or perturbations from a tertiary component .",
    "another alternative explanation is precession induced by dynamical tides @xcite .",
    "we made efforts to separate the oscillatory features from the binary characteristics , but there are strong connections between binarity and the detected oscillations .",
    "first , the difference of the two most dominant oscillation frequencies is equal to the twice of the orbital frequency , which indicates a binary origin .",
    "furthermore , the most enigmatic feature of the out - of - eclipse part of the light curve is a sinusoidal variation with similar frequency and amplitude expected for the ellipsoidal effect , but with a completely opposite phase .",
    "finally , there is a low amplitude oscillation at three times the orbital frequency , in addition to the inverse ellipsoidalvariation at twice the orbital frequency .",
    "these phenomena are likely due to tidal effects .",
    "the oscillations at two and three times the orbital frequency are most likely tidally induced oscillations .",
    "however , it is unclear whether they are produced by hydrostatic equilibrium tides or by tidally excited g - modes .",
    "if they are equilibrium tides , non - adiabatic effects must be strongly altering their observed phase .",
    "if they are g - modes , they must be resonantly excited to account for their large amplitudes .",
    "finally , the observed combination frequency @xmath72 indicates that non - linear mode coupling with the tidally excited oscillations is occurring .",
    "we are hopeful that a more detailed tidal analysis of hd 183648 may explain these observations and yield constraints on tidal dissipation theories .",
