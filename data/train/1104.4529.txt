    "the search for the higgs boson / bosons and the study of their properties tops the priority list of the on going experiments at the lhc at 7 tev as well as of the upcoming experiments at the highest attainable energy of 14 tev .",
    "this will shed light on the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) and the generation of the particle masses .",
    "the higgs sector of the very successful standard model ( sm ) of particle physics responsible for ewsb is indeed very simple .",
    "it consists of a single neutral , scalar higgs particle .",
    "however , this economical higgs sector turns out to be the achilles heel of the sm .",
    "the scale of ewsb is expected to be around 100 gev . on the other hand the naturalness or the hierarchy problem",
    "@xcite comes into play , should there be some new physics beyond the sm characterized by a much higher energy scale .",
    "the very existence of the new scale tends to push up the ewsb scale far beyond the expected magnitude .",
    "for example , the higgs boson mass blows up to values closer to the new scale , in contrast to the preferred range @xcite @xmath3 suggested by ew precision data ( the hierarchy problem ) , unless the parameters of the sm are extremely fine tuned ( the naturalness problem ) .",
    "even the absence of any compelling evidence in favour of a new physics model does not allow us to overlook the above issues , since one can not wish away the planck scale , the scale of gravity which is always there .    the above theoretical inconsistency has led to several extensions of the sm .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model(mssm ) @xcite removes the above problem elegantly in the limit of exact supersymmetry ( susy ) and stabilizes the higgs mass .",
    "however , susy must be broken by the soft breaking terms , since the negative results of sparticle searches at various colliders indicate that the superpartners ( or the sparticles ) must be considerably heavier than the corresponding particles . in spite of susy breaking ,",
    "the naturalness problem remain under control , provided the masses of the sparticles are @xmath4 1 tev @xcite or smaller .    in the mssm the higgs sector must necessarily be extended and the spectrum consists of two neutral scalars ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) , one neutral pseudo scalar ( @xmath7 ) and two charged scalars ( @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "enormous amount of work has been done in developing the strategies for searching these bosons at the lhc @xcite . adding any new dimension to the above studies is not the aim of this paper .    however , at the lhc these higgs bosons are likely be produced along with a variety of superpartners of the standard model particles - the sparticles .",
    "in particular the strongly interacting sparticles may indeed be produced in numbers much larger than that of typical higgs induced events . even if a small fraction of such events pass through the selection criteria for the dedicated search of any of the above higgs bosons , then the shape of certain distributions expected for higgs production alone may change significantly , indicating that the higgs boson may be part of a framework larger than the sm .",
    "such an unexpected shape is likely to be prominent near the tails of the distributions under study where contributions from the higgs signal as well as the sm background are naturally small . in this paper",
    "we shall illustrate this possibility with a specific example .",
    "some of the above issues have recently been addressed in the context of charged higgs search by a counting experiment during the lhc-14 tev run @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that both in the unconstrained mssm and in the minimal supergravity(msugra ) model @xcite , susy events can seriously affect the size of the charged higgs signal unless additional selection criteria are introduced . on the other hand , the combined squark - gluino and charged higgs events may establish physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) physics at a confidence level higher than that attainable by the higgs signal alone .",
    "this enhancement would disfavour not only the sm but also its extensions with two higgs doublets .",
    "after this important hint regarding bsm physics , a clean charged higgs sample may be recovered by additional kinematical cuts .",
    "it needs to be emphasized that the above issues are relevant in any extension of the sm with a new particle sector as well as an extended higgs sector .    in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on the search for the lighter cp even scalar higgs boson(h ) .",
    "the h boson in the mssm has properties very similar to the sm higgs boson in a large volume of the parameter space ( the so called decoupling region ) .",
    "thus the discovery of a single neutral higgs scalar , which is a likely scenario in the early stages of the lhc experiment , will yield very little information regarding the underlying theory . the situation may change dramatically if susy is realized in nature in such a way that a sizable number of sparticle induced events change the characteristics of the expected h signal significantly .",
    "this can convincingly establish the bsm origin of the discovered boson .",
    "even the discovery of one or more heavier higgs boson with no counterpart in the sm , would indicate only an extended higgs sector but not the existence of new heavy sparticles .",
    "the mass of h is always bounded from above ( @xmath9 gev ) @xcite in supersymmetric theories . as a consequence",
    "the search strategy for it is very similar to that for the standard higgs boson with mass within the above bound especially in the decoupling region .",
    "if @xmath10 gev , an important discovery channel would be the inclusive di - photon + x channel with a relatively modest integrated luminosity ( @xmath11 ) of a few tens of @xmath12 at the 14 tev run of the lhc ( see figure 10.38 of @xcite ) . here",
    "x stands for any other particle accompanying the h signal .",
    "this signal stems from h production at the lhc via several channels , followed by the one loop decay @xmath13 .",
    "the suppression of the signal due to the tiny branching ratio ( br ) of this decay ( @xmath14 ) is adequately compensated by the relatively low sm background . in the mssm also a small peak in the @xmath15 invariant mass distribution around the h mass would establish the h signal ( see figure 11.37 of @xcite ) .",
    "among various models of softly broken supersymmetry the gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) models @xcite ( to be briefly reviewed below ) predict a large number of di - photon + x events at lhc energies coming from the production of strongly interacting sparticles . in this paper",
    "we wish to focus on the impact of these events on the di - photon invariant mass distribution to be studied by the dedicated h - search experiments with utmost care .    in these models",
    "the gravitino with negligible mass turns out to be the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and , hence , the carrier of missing energy .",
    "if the lightest neutralino ( @xmath16 ) is the next lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) , it can decay into the lsp and a photon with a large br . in r - parity conserving supersymmetry , sparticles are produced in pairs and each of them eventually decay , through a cascade , into a gravitino - photon pair . each susy event in this scenario will , therefore , have the @xmath17 + x topology . thus the pair production of squarks and gluinos in any combination having a large cross section may leave their signature in the observed @xmath15 invariant mass distribution .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly describe different gmsb scenarios and the present collider constraints on them .",
    "we also define our benchmark points for the analysis . in section 3 ,",
    "we present our main results on the di - photon invariant mass distribution in gmsb models at the lhc",
    ". our emphasis will be on the ongoing lhc experiments .",
    "however , the possibilities for the 14 tev experiments will also be briefly touched upon .",
    "our conclusions will be summarized in section 4 .",
    "to begin with we shall review the constraints from different collider experiments on the parameter space of the minimal gmsb ( mgmsb ) model @xcite .",
    "we also wish to add a few points regarding the approximations in obtaining these bounds and the resulting uncertainties which have not been sufficiently elucidated in the current literature . in this model",
    "the soft breaking parameters are generated via the gauge interactions of the sm . as a result the sparticles with the same sm quantum numbers but different flavours acquire the same mass .",
    "this keeps the potentially dangerous flavour changing neutral current induced processes under control .    in the mgmsb model",
    "there is an observable sector consisting of the mssm fields .",
    "the supersymmetry breaking sector consists of a gauge singlet chiral superfield y , identified with the goldstino superfield in the simplest version of the model .",
    "the scalar and auxiliary components of y are assumed to develop vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) denoted by s and f respectively . in the early versions of this model",
    "the dynamics of generating these vevs were not specified .",
    "the model also has a messenger sector consisting of superfields @xmath18 having the gauge interaction of the sm .",
    "the messenger superfields interact with y via a tree level interaction in the superpotential .",
    "this generates a supersymmetric mass of @xmath19(m ) of the messenger fields , usually referred to as the messenger scale .",
    "a susy breaking mass squared splittings of the order f is also generated within the messenger supermultiplets .",
    "this susy breaking is communicated to the observable sector by gauge interactions between the messenger and the observable fields via higher order processes .",
    "a restriction in the messenger sector comes from the requirement of the unification of the coupling constants of the standard model . if the messenger superfields form complete gut multiplets ( e.g. , 5 or @xmath20 of su(5 ) ) , the value of the unification scale or the gut scale ( @xmath21 ) does not change .",
    "however , coupling constant unification constrains the number of messenger superfields(n ) to be @xmath22 5 .",
    "the simple mgmsb model is characterized by five parameters @xcite @xmath23 , m , @xmath24 , tan @xmath25 and sign(@xmath26 )    where @xmath23 = f / s is the susy breaking scale in the observable sector , m is the messenger mass scale , @xmath24 is the number of messenger multiplets belonging to the 5 + @xmath20 representation of su(5 ) , tan @xmath25 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the neutral higgs fields in the observable sector and @xmath26 is the higgs mixing parameter in the superpotential with magnitude fixed by the radiative symmetry breaking condition .",
    "it bears recall that the soft breaking trilinear ( a ) and bilinear ( b ) parameters are generated by higher order processes and are small at the messenger scale m. the weak scale parameters are then obtained by the standard renormalization group ( rg ) evolutions .",
    "the sparticle spectrum at the weak scale can be computed by both suspect version 2.41 @xcite and isajet @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of this model has been discussed by various authors @xcite    the current experimental lower bound on the higgs boson mass from lep @xmath27 gev @xcite poses the strongest constraint on the parameter space of the mgmsb model .",
    "given the input parameters one can compute the higgs mass including higher order corrections .",
    "in this paper @xmath27 gev will be henceforth referred to as the stronger bound on the computed h - mass .",
    "however , there is an estimated theoretical uncertainty of about 3 gev on the computed h - mass due to yet unknown higher order effects@xcite . in view of this a point in the parameter space with computed @xmath28 111.4 gev ( the weaker h - mass bound ) may still be acceptable .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mh_tb ] we present @xmath29 computed as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "we take @xmath30=173 gev , @xmath31=@xmath32 , @xmath24=1 .",
    "it follows that for tan @xmath25 = 5 ( tan @xmath25 = 20 ) the stronger h - mass bound yields a lower bound @xmath33 257 tev ( 118 tev ) .",
    "if , however , the theoretical uncertainties are taken into account and the weaker @xmath29 bound is used instead , relaxed bounds @xmath33 161 tev ( 79 tev ) are obtained .",
    "it is interesting to note that for @xmath34 , @xmath35 gev which corresponds to gluino mass ( @xmath36 ) and average squark mass ( @xmath37 ) of approximately 2 tev and 3 tev respectively .",
    "thus should the higgs mass bound continues to be pushed upwards , the squark - gluino search at the lhc , as predicted by mgmsb , will be quite challenging .",
    "the @xmath38 and cdf collaborations have put strong constraints on nlsp ( @xmath39 ) mass . in order to obtain quantitative results",
    "they consider sps8 slope in the mgmsb model which has only one parameter @xmath23 .",
    "the other parameters are fixed and given by @xmath31=2@xmath23 , @xmath40=15 , @xmath24=1 and @xmath41 .",
    "the lifetime of the @xmath39 is not fixed by these parameters and it is assumed to be sufficiently short .",
    "it means that the photon coming from the decay of @xmath39 is prompt .",
    "the gaugino pair production processes are expected to be dominant at the tevatron .",
    "the decay of two @xmath39 produce two photons and gravitinos that give rise to missing energy .",
    "the latest constraint is from @xmath38 collaboration who have obtained a lower bound 124 tev on the scale @xmath23 with 6.3 @xmath12 of data at run ii @xcite .",
    "we have computed the leading order ( lo ) cross sections for the dominant susy processes at tevatron energies ( mainly electroweak gaugino pair production ) using pythia @xcite . the next to leading order(nlo ) cross section and the k factor with renormalization scale(@xmath42)= factorization scale ( @xmath43)= 2@xmath44 is computed by prospino @xcite .",
    "our cross section for @xmath23=124 tev ( assuming sps8 point ) is in good agreement with the result in @xcite .",
    "we find that the above bound corresponds to an upper bound on the susy production cross section of 4.5 fb . for promptly decaying @xmath16 this",
    "@xmath45 yields @xmath46 174 gev .",
    "this bound is indicated in the @xmath23 - tan@xmath25 plane ( figure [ fig : scan ] ) by the horizontal line . for comparison the stronger and weaker h",
    "- mass bounds are also indicated in the same figure .",
    "it follows that the d0 bound on @xmath45 supersedes that from the stronger ( relaxed ) @xmath29 bound for tab @xmath47 15 ( 6.5 ) .",
    "it follows that irrespective of the uncertainties in @xmath29 due to higher order corrections and the choice of tan @xmath25 , values of @xmath23 smaller than 124 tev are disfavoured .",
    "this bound also supersedes the earlier cdf lower bound on susy scale 107 tev@xcite .",
    "the assumptions underlying this bound will be critically examined below .    strictly speaking",
    "the @xmath38 bound is valid for the snowmass slope sps8 with variable @xmath23 .",
    "the other parameters are m = 2 @xmath23 , @xmath24 = 1 , tan @xmath25 = 15 and sign ( @xmath48 0 . for @xmath49 2 ,",
    "the scenario reduces to a @xmath50 nlsp scenario which is not under consideration in the present paper .",
    "however , keeping other parameters fixed and varying tan @xmath25 we have checked that neither the cross sections of the dominant processes ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 pair production @xcite ) at the tevatron energy nor the @xmath53 and @xmath54 masses vary appreciably with tan @xmath25 .",
    "this is , however , expected since over the scanned parameter space the above gauginos are wino like to a very good approximation and have masses controlled by the @xmath55 gaugino mass @xmath56 at the weak scale .",
    "the cross section , therefore , shows only a mild tan @xmath25 dependence .",
    "the bino - like @xmath16 mass on the other hand is determined by the @xmath57 gaugino mass parameter ( @xmath58 ) at the weak scale related to @xmath56 by the gaugino mass unification condition .",
    "we shall , therefore , use the @xmath38 bound throughout this analysis unless the electroweak gauginos happen to be significantly mixed , which is often the case for non - minimal models to be discussed below .",
    "the neutralino mass bound from tevatron has an important advantage .",
    "the predicted @xmath29 depends sensitively on @xmath30 ( recall the @xmath59 dependence in the radiative corrections to @xmath29 ) .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath23 consistent with the weaker or stronger h - mass bound as a function of @xmath30 is presented in figure [ fig : top_sen ] for two values of tan @xmath25 : 5 and 20 .",
    "the top masses on the x - axis are allowed by the current bound obtained by a recent cdf measurement @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "these curves illustrate the uncertainty in @xmath45 due to the present error in @xmath30 .",
    "the neutralino mass bound , on the other hand , shows no strong @xmath30-dependence . throughout this paper",
    "we shall use @xmath30 = 173 gev .    in summary , while choosing the representative points for calculating the susy contribution to the di - photon invariant mass spectrum in the gmsb model , the @xmath45 from the weaker h - mass bound ( neutralino mass bound ) should be used for tan @xmath61 6.5 ( tan @xmath62 6.5 ) .",
    "another theoretical uncertainty comes from the choice of the messenger scale m. in table [ m_variation ] we present the variation of the sparticle spectrum with m. we find that the variation of m within moderate ranges does not affect the spectrum and , hence , the collider signatures drastically .    [ 0.90 ]    .__variation of sparticle masses as a function of the messenger scale ( @xmath63 ) for fixed susy scale and @xmath64 in the minimal gmsb model . _ _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     of course a suitable cut can easily eliminate these unwanted events .",
    "for example , the distribution in figure [ fig : eff ] suggests that a cut of @xmath65 300 can eliminate the susy contributions around the higgs mass peak , while the higgs signal and the sm backgrounds remain practically unaffected . before the cut",
    ", however , the non - standard origin of the higgs boson will be revealed by the @xmath66 distribution .",
    "the susy events around the higgs peak can also be eliminated by putting an upper cut on the @xmath0 . however , as already discussed the @xmath66 distribution provides a strong hint for the presence of new heavy particles , whereas large @xmath0 can come from massless particles and/or jet energy mis - measurements .",
    "in this paper we analyze the invariant mass distribution of the di - photons to be minutely studied by the dedicated higgs search experiments in the di - photon + x channel at the lhc . in the sm only a tiny peak at @xmath29 above the sm background is expected . in gmsb models , in contrast , the di - photons stemming from squark - gluino events may distort the tail of the distribution far away from the higgs mass peak revealing the non - standard origin of the higgs boson .",
    "in this paper we explore this possibility both at lhc 7 tev and 14 tev experiments by considering benchmark points in different gmsb models - minimal as well as non - minimal ( table 5 ) @xcite .",
    "we also consider a simplified model recently employed by the cms collaboration to interpret their negative results for susy search in the ggmsb models and illustrate the above point through a detailed parameter space scan .",
    "we first consider the minimal gmsb @xcite model subject to the lower bounds on @xmath29 from lep and on the lightest neutralino ( nlsp ) mass ( or equivalently on the scale @xmath23 ) from tevatron ( see figures [ fig : mh_tb ] and [ fig : scan ] ) .",
    "the resulting lower bounds on the squark - gluino masses are so strong that di - photon events induced by sparticle production with tiny cross - sections are unlikely to affect the h - signal .",
    "this has been illustrated with the help of two benchmark points ( bp i and ii , table [ bp_mgmsb ] ) in section 3 .",
    "the @xmath38 and the cdf experiments actually constrain quantity @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the total sparticle production cross section within the kinematic reach of the tevatron , br ( @xmath69 is the branching ratio underlying each single photon event . the bounds on @xmath23 or the nlsp mass in the mgmsb model are derived with the assumption that the above br is one .    if br @xmath70 is significantly smaller than 1 , the limit on @xmath68 and , consequently , on @xmath23 or the nlsp mass become weaker .",
    "this can happen in the mgmsb model ( table [ branching ] ) and , more importantly , in its generalizations ( table 6 ) . while extracting @xmath45 from the tevatron data in different models we have taken this possible reduction into account and have selected our benchmark points accordingly ( see table [ bp_nonminimal ] ) . in some of the models the total squark - gluino cross sections are significantly larger than the expected values in the mgmsb model and the relevant brs are not too small either ( see table [ cross ] ) .",
    "more recently it has been shown that the distinct features of these phenomenological models can be incorporated into theoretically well - motivated models@xcite .      1 .",
    "the di - photon + x events from sparticle production may change the shape of the tail of the @xmath71 invariant mass distributions which will be analyzed with utmost care by the lhc experiments .",
    "this distortion was shown to be statistically significant in several benchmark scenarios of the non - minimal gmsb models for both lhc 7 tev ( table [ result_7 ] ) and 14 tev ( table [ result_14 ] ) experiments . in both cases",
    "the traces of new physics beyond the higgs sector may show up at the early stages of the experiments with @xmath11 insufficient for the discovery of the h boson in the di - photon + x channel .",
    "similar conclusions follow by analyzing a simplified model @xcite ( figures [ fig : reach7 ] and [ fig : reach14 ] ) .",
    "other observables like the effective mass distribution of the di - photon events may also contain hints of new physics consisting of heavy particles ( figure [ fig : eff ] ) .",
    "unexpected shapes of this distribution may disfavour not only the sm but i ) extensions of it with larger higgs sectors but no new heavy particles , ii ) models with other susy breaking mechanisms like msugra which do not have natural sources of di - photon events from sparticle production and iii ) the mgmsb model subject to the constraints from lep and tevatron .",
    "3 .   the squark - gluino induced @xmath71 events may contaminate the peak of the invariant mass distribution at @xmath29 ( see table [ inv_h ] ) . to improve the purity of the h - signal one may implement cuts on suitable kinematical variables like an upper cut on the effective mass ( see figure [ fig : eff ] ) or an upper cut on the missing energy which eliminate the sparticle induced events in the higgs peak .",

    "<S> the invariant mass distribution of the di - photons from the decay of the lighter scalar higgs boson(h ) to be carefully measured by dedicated h search experiments at the lhc may be distorted by the di - photons associated with the squark - gluino events with much larger cross sections in gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) models . </S>",
    "<S> this distortion if observed by the experiments at the large hadron collider at 7 tev or 14 tev , would disfavour not only the standard model but various two higgs doublet models with comparable h - masses and couplings but without a sector consisting of new heavy particles decaying into photons . </S>",
    "<S> the minimal gmsb ( mgmsb ) model constrained by the mass bound on h from lep and that on the lightest neutralino from the tevatron , produce negligible effects . </S>",
    "<S> but in the currently popular general gmsb(ggmsb ) models the tail of the above distribution may show statistically significant excess of events even in the early stages of the lhc experiments with integrated luminosity insufficient for the discovery of h. we illustrate the above points by introducing several benchmark points in various gmsb models - minimal as well as non - minimal . </S>",
    "<S> the same conclusion follows from a detailed parameter scan in a simplified ggmsb model recently employed by the cms collaboration to interpret their searches in the di - photon + @xmath0 channel . </S>",
    "<S> other observables like the effective mass distribution of the di - photon + x events may also reveal the presence of new heavy particles beyond the higgs sector . </S>",
    "<S> the contamination of the h mass peak and simple remedies are also discussed .    </S>",
