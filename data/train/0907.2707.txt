    "a necessary prerequisite for understanding any medium response to the traversal of a high - energy parton is to understand in detail how the parton deposits energy ( i.e. how much energy on average and with what distribution in energy and in space - time ) .",
    "the measurement of single inclusive high @xmath0 hadron suppression ( @xmath1 ) has proven to be very useful for making an overall characterization of the energy loss . however , there are a variety of parton energy - loss formalisms that currently give approximately equal goodness - of - fit to the experimental data , but with very different implications for the quenching power of the medium  @xcite .",
    "to be clear , the @xmath1 comparison allows one to tightly constrain this quenching power within a given model , but not to discriminate between models .",
    "it has been proposed that di - jet ( as well as direct photon - jet and fully reconstructed jet ) observations will provide this discriminating power .",
    "first measurements via di - hadron correlations at high @xmath0 have been made by the star experiment , though they are somewhat statistics limited in the @xmath2 baseline measurement  @xcite . in the context of two parton energy - loss models ( zoww  @xcite and pqm  @xcite ) , we show in figure  [ fig_constraint ] the calculation results for @xmath1 and @xmath3 as a function of the quenching power ( either @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) . also shown are the resulting modified @xmath6 ( including experimental statistical and systematic uncertainties , but not theoretical uncertainties ) when confronted with the @xmath1 and @xmath3 data .",
    "it is striking that the best fit is a larger ( smaller ) quenching implied from @xmath3 as opposed to @xmath1 for zoww ( pqm ) model .",
    "there are also recent results with asw energy - loss embedded in a hydrodynamical medium that result in a somewhat more consistent description of both @xmath1 and @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "this provokes one to question what has been learned since this was a more discriminating observation .",
    "we can speculate that in a model with the same average energy loss , but smaller fluctuations ( i.e. a larger number of lower energy radiated gluons ) , one might have more surface bias and thus a lower @xmath3 for the same @xmath1 .",
    "currently other model differences such as medium geometry make it challenging to discriminate between the underlying energy - loss physics mechanisms .",
    "the techqm effort  @xcite is working to resolve these issues , but it is undermined if the community simply claims that `` all models roughly agree with the data . ''",
    "the resolution to discriminating between the parton energy - loss formalisms will not come exclusively from theory ; and there are additional experimental handles , including as an example the recent measure of @xmath1 versus reaction plane  @xcite .",
    "( black solid line ) and @xmath3 ( red solid line ) ( left y - axis ) as a function of @xmath4 or @xmath5 . also shown ( right y - axis )",
    "are @xmath7 for @xmath1 ( black dashed line ) and for @xmath3 ( red dashed line ) when comparing theory to experimental data  @xcite . ]",
    "the ridge is defined as a correlation in momentum space between particles that are extended over many units in pseudo - rapidity ( @xmath8 ) and relatively narrow in azimuthal angle ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "in fact , there are multiple observations of ridge - like phenomena ( which may or may not originate from a common physics mechanism ) .",
    "there are preliminary results of a hard ridge where a high @xmath0 trigger particle ( 3 - 12 gev/@xmath10 ) is correlated with a moderate @xmath0 associated particle ( 2 - 4 gev/@xmath10 )  @xcite .",
    "there are also preliminary results of a soft ridge where the two correlated particles are simply required to have @xmath11 gev/@xmath10  @xcite . in between the two ( which was referred to as the just right ridge )",
    "are published results from the phobos experiment with trigger particles with @xmath12 gev/@xmath10 and associated particles with @xmath13 gev/@xmath10  @xcite .",
    "preliminary studies from phenix and star of the transverse momentum spectra , hadron chemistry ( i.e. baryon / meson ratios ) , and centrality scaling have been shown  @xcite .",
    "these reveal that the @xmath0 spectra in the ridge is similar to that of the bulk medium ( with some indications of being slightly harder ) .",
    "this is in striking contrast to the much harder @xmath0 spectrum of jet fragmentation .",
    "there is significant enhancement of the baryon / meson ratio in the ridge , quite similar to the bulk medium ( and again in contrast to vacuum jet fragmentation ) .",
    "finally the ridge yield appears to scale per trigger particle as the number of participating nucleons ( similar to the bulk medium ) . note that for the hard and just right ridge",
    ", the ridge yield is only of order a one percent modulation of the yield of the bulk medium .",
    "this is not true for the soft ridge where the yield is a much larger fraction , though the experimental methodology is very different ( as we discuss later ) .",
    "one additional comment regarding the ` hard ridge ' relates to the question of whether the ridge persists up to the highest @xmath0 trigger particles . results from phenix  @xcite show no evidence for the ridge with trigger particle @xmath0 @xmath14 5 gev/@xmath10 .",
    "however , as noted in the publication , due to the limited pseudo - rapidity acceptance , if the jet peak is increasing with trigger @xmath0 , it may be that the result is not sensitive to the smaller ridge contribution .",
    "this appears to be the case since star preliminary results show a significant ridge yield for 0 - 10% central au - au events that appears constant all the way up to @xmath15 8 gev/@xmath10 with @xmath16 2 gev/@xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the various theoretical models can be grouped into two categories .",
    "the first are referred to as * causation models * ( i.e. where @xmath17 ( for example a jet parton losing energy ) causes @xmath18 ( the ridge ) ) .",
    "the second are referred to as * auto - correlation models * ( i.e. where @xmath19 causes @xmath17 and @xmath19 also causes @xmath18 , such that @xmath17 and @xmath18 are auto - correlated ) .",
    "most causation models assume that the cause of the ridge is a quenched jet .",
    "examples include calculations where the radiation from the jet is broadened in rapidity due to collective flow   @xcite and where the radiation from the jet is broadened by turbulent color fields  @xcite .",
    "however , in both of these cases the ridge has a gaussian shape in pseudo - rapidity with @xmath20 units .",
    "it is difficult for models with quenching parameters that reproduce the suppression of high @xmath0 hadrons to achieve a broader ridge width .",
    "note that these models would also provide no explanation for the soft ridge. the phobos experiment has shown the just right ridge to have a width that extends over four units of pseudo - rapidity  @xcite .",
    "one might have concerns that this four units in pseudo - rapidity might be quite different in rapidity .",
    "since phobos includes associated particles down to @xmath0 = 0.035 gev/@xmath10 , for @xmath8 = 4 , that would only be @xmath21 1 for protons and @xmath22 2.5 for pions .",
    "however , the phase space contributions at this lowest @xmath0 are not very large . in addition ,",
    "the star preliminary results indicate a width of @xmath23 1.4  @xcite , and since the @xmath0 associated particles are much higher , pseudo - rapidity and rapidity are much closer .",
    "thus , these causation models are essentially ruled out as the dominant mechanism for producing the ridge .     as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "shown in comparison are calculations from various theoretical models described in the text .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]   as a function of @xmath8 . shown in comparison",
    "are calculations from various theoretical models described in the text .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    another causation model is the momentum kick model  @xcite .",
    "the model includes an effect that is similar to an initial state @xmath24 scatter , but from the jet parton .",
    "the soft partons are given a momentum kick ( given by the parameter @xmath25 ) , which is tuned to match the data ( where the kick is assumed to be exactly along the direction of the jet parton ) .",
    "one concern in this model is that one needs to know the y and @xmath0 distribution of the soft partons , and an arbitrary distribution set could essentially match any possible ridge data .",
    "thus , it is critical to demonstrate that these distributions are not arbitrary ( e.g by having additional ( non - ridge ) tests and constraints on them ) . with the currently published parameter set",
    ", this model gives a reasonable description of the ridge yield and full extent of @xmath8 = 4 as shown by the phobos data .",
    "one can also compare the width of the ridge in @xmath9 , which has been a somewhat overlooked key feature of the ridge . as shown in figure  [ fig_ridge_theorycomp ] , this model significantly over - predicts the width of the ridge in @xmath9 and has a trend for a wider ridge width at larger rapidity gap .",
    "one can understand this effect by considering the case where phobos measures a trigger particle at pseudo - rapidity + 1.5 and the associated particle at pseudo - rapidity = -2.5 ( to get a gap of 4 units ) . since the momentum kick @xmath26 is always along the trigger parton ,",
    "some of the kick is longitudinal ( and thus there is less focusing in @xmath27 ) .",
    "finally , the causation model  @xcite postulates that the away - side jet produces a back - splash in the medium .",
    "thus , the large range in pseudo - rapidity is caused by the away side jet swing ( assuming the initial two partons that scattered have @xmath28 or vice versa ) .",
    "this interesting idea requires a full simulation of the time scales involved to create the correlation to further test this picture .",
    "the second main category of explanations are auto - correlation models. a common feature of these models is that there is a local hot spot ( in the transverse plane ) in the initial collision ( i.e. at the earliest time ) .",
    "this hot spot expands longitudinally ( and thus in rapidity space ) and produces both the trigger and associated particle by different mechanisms .",
    "however , because they originate from a common location in the transverse plane , they may both be correlated with the radial vector in the overlap region ( and thus auto - correlated into an extended ridge in @xmath8 and narrow in @xmath9 ) .",
    "one such calculation is the jet induced ridge model  @xcite . in this picture",
    "there is no specific description of the longitudinally extended hot spot , and thus there is no quantitative prediction of the width in @xmath8 .",
    "however , the trigger particle is focused along the transverse radial direction via jet quenching ( since the radial vector represents the shortest path out of the medium ) .",
    "the associate particle ( many units in rapidity away ) is focused via radial flow from the outwardly exploding medium .",
    "we have re - calculated the results from this model and find that for any jet quenching attenuation parameter ( @xmath29 which exponentially suppresses particles traversing a given path length ) , the narrowest possible ridge in @xmath9 is approximately 0.8 radians . as shown in figure  [ fig_ridge_jetinduced ] , the trigger particle does not experience sufficient focusing to describe the ridge width in @xmath9 . also , it is notable that for @xmath30 fm , the single hadron nuclear modification factor is already @xmath31 ( significantly lower than published experimental data ) . note that the ridge is too wide in @xmath9 both for the star and phobos data ( as also shown in figure  [ fig_ridge_theorycomp ] ) .     as a function of the trigger particle @xmath0 and for various range of associated particle @xmath0 .",
    "the results are shown for pions and protons .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]   as a function of the trigger particle @xmath0 and for various range of associated particle @xmath0 .",
    "the results are shown for pions and protons .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    it is striking that the radial flow is much more effective at focusing the associated particle in the above model .",
    "thus , an alternative model is that both trigger and associated particles are focused by radial flow .",
    "this was originally proposed in  @xcite and is incorporated into the other calculations  @xcite .",
    "however , they also implement a specific description of the hot spot s longitudinal correlation ( namely color glass condensate or glasma flux tubes ) .",
    "this provides a reasonable description of the soft ridge from the star preliminary data .",
    "this model would not have a prediction for the hard ridge case . at this conference ,",
    "a hybrid model was proposed  @xcite where focusing by radial flow is only for the soft ridge and at higher @xmath0 trigger there is an increasing contribution from jet induced ridge correlations .",
    "this model gives a better description ; however , for very high @xmath0 triggers ( e.g. @xmath14 8",
    "gev/@xmath10 ) it should predict identical results to the jet induced ridge and fail to describe the experimental data .",
    "we performed a simple calculation , shown in figure  [ fig_ridge_jetinduced ] , of the ridge width in @xmath9 assuming focusing of the trigger and associated particle by radial flow only . in the case of radial flow ,",
    "the higher the @xmath0 of the particles , the larger the implied radial boost received and thus the more focusing along the radial direction .",
    "this simple calculation was performed assuming a temperature @xmath32140 mev and a linear boost profile with @xmath33 .",
    "the exact widths are sensitive to these parameters and the linear boost profile assumption",
    ". however , this type of model makes a specific prediction , that for moderate @xmath0 trigger and associated particles , if the particles are protons instead of pions , the focusing is substantially larger .",
    "this prediction needs to be checked experimentally .",
    "a model that takes this soft boosted picture into a full hydrodynamic regime is by takahashi _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . in this calculation",
    "they have fluctuating event - by - event initial conditions from nexus , then followed by spherio hydrodynamic evolution , and completed with cooper - frye hadronization . in this picture , the longitudinally extended hot spot ( from the underlying nexus dynamics ) results in a very clear ridge - like structure .",
    "it is notable that there is an additional jet - like peak , despite the fact that the model has in principle no jets traversing the hydrodynamic medium .",
    "more precise predictions for these ridge features as a function of trigger and associated particle @xmath0 are needed as next steps .    at the conference ,",
    "r. hwa pointed out that the narrow width of the ridge in @xmath9 could be an artifact of the zyam normalization .",
    "since one forces a zero point in the correlation function ( which turns out to be at @xmath34 ) , it is difficult to find a width in @xmath9 greater than 0.3 - 0.4 units .",
    "thus , for the phobos and star ridge results , the width values shown could be under - estimates . as shown in figure  [ fig_zyam_check ] , we have calculated how much the true normalization would have to differ from the zyam normalization in order to accommodate a much wider ridge ( utilizing the published phobos raw correlation function data  @xcite ) .",
    "we have constrained the ridge width in @xmath9 to fixed values ( stepping over a wide range ) and then left as free parameters the ridge yield , the away side structure ( broken into a punch through peak centered at @xmath35 and two shoulder peaks centered at @xmath36 ) , and the @xmath37 modulated background normalization .",
    "we find that for any value of the ridge width in @xmath9 , one can achieve an equally good description of the experimental data . as shown in the lower left panel , if there is a 1% deviation in the background normalization from zyam one can have a width in @xmath9 of 0.6 units , and for 3% a width of 0.8 units . in the case of the phobos data",
    "however , they have also checked that the zyam normalization follows an expected scaling with centrality ( which is akin to the absolute normalization technique  @xcite ) .",
    "though it deserves additional scrutiny , it appears that even a 1% normalization difference from zyam is unlikely .",
    "the star hard ridge results also should be checked with absolute normalization . note also that if the normalization is different by 1% , such that the ridge @xmath38 units ( in agreement with the momentum kick model for example ) , the ridge yield would be much larger ( then in disagreement with the momentum kick model ) .",
    "-2.0 : -4.0 ( i.e. away from the near - side jet peak ) .",
    "we have forced the ridge width to specific values ( stepping over a large range ) and always find a good fit to the experimental data given a particular ( free parameter ) background normalization level ( deviating from zyam ) .",
    "the upper panel shows the experimental data and example fits with a ridge width of @xmath39 0.3 and 0.6 radians .",
    "the lower panel shows how the normalization level deviates from zyam for different forced ridge widths .",
    "note that a 1% deviation in the normalization can increase the ridge @xmath40 from 0.3 to 0.6 , and a 3% deviation can increase it to 0.8 .",
    "( right panel ) @xmath41-hadron azimuthal correlations  @xcite .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]   -2.0 : -4.0 ( i.e. away from the near - side jet peak ) .",

    "the lower panel shows how the normalization level deviates from zyam for different forced ridge widths .",
    "note that a 1% deviation in the normalization can increase the ridge @xmath40 from 0.3 to 0.6 , and a 3% deviation can increase it to 0.8 .",
    "( right panel ) @xmath41-hadron azimuthal correlations  @xcite .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    a point that deserves more attention is that the soft ridge has a width in @xmath39 0.9 - 1.2 units  @xcite .",
    "however , this preliminary analysis is not done with zyam , but fitting all components expected in the correlation function with floating normalizations .",
    "as the data moves towards publication , a full quantification of the correlated uncertainties in these parameters is crucial , as they currently have a much larger ridge yield and much wider width than the ridge results that utilize zyam . as previously mentioned , the soft ridge yield is very large ( a substantial fraction of the entire yield ) , which would also be true if we forced the ridge width to be @xmath14 1.0 units for the phobos correlation .",
    "we note that in the above test we performed with the phobos data , we can get an equally good fit to the data ( i.e. within @xmath42 from the best fit ) for any normalization varying from zyam ( even greater than 15% ) .",
    "thus , in that particular test , the fit alone gives essentially no constraint on the ridge width and yield .",
    "the models with an auto - correlation of soft boosted trigger and associated particles appears quite compelling .",
    "this physics must be there at some level .",
    "however , the ridge structure appears to persist even for trigger @xmath0 @xmath14 8 gev/@xmath10 .",
    "this seems to contradict many other pieces of evidence that 8 gev/@xmath10 @xmath0 particles are not predominantly soft thermal particles with a very large radial boost .",
    "in the hybrid approach  @xcite , the ridge should show a significant broadening at high @xmath0 as one transitions to the jet induced case .",
    "this effect is not seen , though perhaps it is masked by the zyam normalization .",
    "it will be important to do more checks for both the phobos and star ridge cases .",
    "data shown at this conference on three - particle correlations should also be of great interest , though the models at this point are already challenged by the existing two - particle correlation data and trends .",
    "di - hadron azimuthal correlations have also revealed interesting physics on the opposite side of the trigger particle . for the case of moderate @xmath0 trigger particles and",
    "low to moderate @xmath0 associated particles , there appears to be a split - peak on the away side .",
    "it has been postulated that this structure is a mach - cone from a super - sonic parton  @xcite or gluon cerenkov radiation or other medium disturbances .",
    "the star experiment has published exciting results on three - particle correlations  @xcite .",
    "it is notable that there are now observations of similar phenomena from cern - sps data that challenge the various theoretical models as a response of the medium ( without significant dissipation ) .",
    "simplified models can reproduce the main features of the experimental data  @xcite , but full hydrodynamic calculations of a medium response have not .",
    "additional attempts within the context of ads / cft are also being made .",
    "shown in figure  [ fig_zyam_check ] are results that indicate a broad away side correlation for modest trigger @xmath0 particles , but no statistically significant indication for higher @xmath0 particles of anything except a single gaussian peak .",
    "most medium response models should predict a continued response for higher @xmath0 trigger particles , though none is currently seen .",
    "we note that it is not ruled out that the `` punch - through '' peak ( or potentially tangential emission ) may be subsuming the medium response .",
    "this is a key additional experimental test of the various explanations .",
    "an alternative picture is emerging that proposes that the away - side structure is due to auto - correlations of an initial hot - spot with the transverse geometry and flow  @xcite .",
    "one particular idea relates to strong initial state fluctuations that produce event - by - event spatial anisotropies that can translate into surprising momentum anisotropies with various fourier coefficients ( for example @xmath43 ) .",
    "there are also pictures in - between where parton recombination couples these soft medium particles with those from the initial di - jet partons  @xcite ( relating both the away - side and ridge structures ) .",
    "these ideas are getting serious consideration and need to also be confronted with the full set of experimental observables in a quantitative manner .",
    "this exciting area of heavy ion physics has the potential to teach us an enormous amount about the hot partonic medium created . to realize this potential",
    ", experimentalists will need to continue to work hard to publish results with fully quantified systematic uncertainties and theorists will need to continue to learn from cases where data and theory agree and where they disagree .",
