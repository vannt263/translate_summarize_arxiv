    "double - lined spectroscopic binaries , and in particular their eclipsing variant ( eb - sb2s ) , are important astrophysical testbeds that provide a wealth of constraints on stellar models .",
    "eb - sb2s are the primary provider of accurate stellar masses and radii .",
    "when coupled with accurate atmospheric temperatures , the orbital solution of eb - sb2s geometrically fixes the distance with great accuracy , becoming a critical testbed even for _ hipparcos _ astrometric parallaxes .",
    "if the components of a binary were born together , then they lie on the same isochrone .",
    "this constrains their metallicity and stellar models that reproduce them , including recent refinements such as the efficiency of overshooting and the role of atmospheric sedimentation of heavy elements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite provide a recent and updated review of astrophysical results based on the study of binaries .    the radial velocity experiment ( rave )",
    "is an ongoing multi - fiber spectroscopic survey based on the uk schmidt telescope at the anglo australian observatory . with",
    "a goal of observing 1 million stars , the survey has so far gathered more than 400,000 spectra in the magnitude range between @xmath3 .",
    "the wavelength range of spectra covers the near - infrared ( near - ir ) interval from @xmath4 to @xmath5 with a resolving power of @xmath6 , typically with a high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ; mean value of 45 ) .",
    "this range is virtually free from any telluric lines .",
    "the doppler shift of the lines permits us to measure the radial velocity to a precision of @xmath7 , and several prominent metallic and hydrogen spectral lines make it possible to derive accurate stellar atmospheric parameters and chemical composition ( see @xcite ; @xcite for more details ) .",
    "so far two data releases have been published ( @xcite , @xcite , hereafter z08 ) , and a third one will soon be released .    the primary goal of the rave survey is to measure precise radial velocities and atmospheric parameters of up to a million normal single stars with known proper motions and photometric data .",
    "the atmospheric parameters are used to infer the absolute magnitude and to estimate the distance to the targets @xcite .",
    "this in turn fixes all six phase space coordinates and galactic orbits .",
    "when coupled with information on metallicity and chemical abundances ( which rave also provides ) , the rave survey is well suited to investigate galactic structure and dynamics @xcite .",
    "the unbiased sample of input stars selected for rave also includes , of course , a minority of peculiar and spectroscopic binary stars .",
    "the ability of rave spectra to identify and properly characterize spectra with special features has already been demonstrated by the study of luminous blue variable supergiants in the large magellanic cloud @xcite and diffuse interstellar bands over the rave wavelength range @xcite .",
    "double - lined binary stars are not specifically tackled by the rave main analysis pipeline .",
    "the aim of this paper is to discuss a tool parallel to the main pipeline to identify double - lined binary star candidates ( and to distinguish them from other types of peculiar stars , in particular those showing emission line cores ) , and to derive the radial velocity and atmospheric parameters of both components .",
    "the analysis is carried out on the rave second data release .",
    "single - lined binaries collected from repeated observations will be treated in a separate paper . ",
    "[ section_classification ] discusses the sb2 detection method , based on the shape of the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) . in  [ section_simulation ]",
    "we evaluate the performance of our method on a sample of synthetic binary spectra .",
    "two tables in ",
    "[ section_list ] list all the binary candidates we have discovered among rave stars from the second data release , along with radial velocities and effective temperatures of both components .",
    "the identification of all peculiar and sb2 spectra in the rave survey is relevant because ( 1 ) it cleans the survey products from potentially faulty results , ( 2 ) offers a list of objects interesting per se and worthy of further and individual consideration , and ( 3 ) will eventually allow for a population study of those types of objects .",
    "the large ( and continuously growing ) number of spectra recorded by the rave survey makes it impossible to evaluate all of them by hand .",
    "the identification of peculiar and sb2 spectra has to be carried out by automated procedures . to gain specific experience and to provide a comparison ground for the results of the automated procedure",
    ", we have nevertheless performed an eye inspection on each of the @xmath825,000 spectra included in the second rave data release .    for the purpose of identification of peculiar and sb2 spectra ,",
    "we have adopted a method based on the properties of the ( ccf ) between the observed spectrum @xmath9 and a synthetic template spectrum @xmath10 , @xmath11 with integration covering the whole spectral range @xmath12 and the synthetic spectrum taken from the library of @xcite , the same as adopted for the main rave @xmath13 analysis pipeline .",
    "the procedure works by examining several properties of the observed spectra and the ccf in a few steps . as an input it requires a flux - normalized observed spectrum , its s / n value , and a rough estimate of the effective temperature .",
    "the latter two values are already provided by the main rave analysis pipeline .",
    "we have also tested other numerical methods that are commonly used for the purpose of classification - artificial neural networks , support vector machines and principal component analysis .",
    "none of those methods worked well for our purposes , most likely due to the overwhelming number of different morphological features that are present in the observed spectra , which are extremely hard to efficiently represent in a training sample . for this reason we focused on the cross - correlation method ,",
    "which is detailed in the following section .",
    "the goal of the classification pipeline is to separate different types of spectra and to discover spectra with systematic or other observational errors .",
    "it is required that the value of the s / n ratio is greater than 13 .",
    "that limit was set in z08 where it was shown that the estimation of atmospheric parameters for spectra at lower s / n becomes unreliable and only the major spectral lines are still distinguishable .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that classification would also become unreliable below that limit .",
    "next , the minimal and maximal flux values are verified .",
    "if the minimal value ( of any single pixel ) is negative , the spectrum is rejected since it has clearly undergone some problems in background subtraction . on the other hand",
    "the limits on maximal values are more problematic because rejecting spectra with emission lines is not our goal . taking that into account we set the upper limit to @xmath14 by inspecting the normalized flux distribution of a large number of spectra .",
    "it showed that less than @xmath15 of the spectra have their maximum flux above that value , mostly as a result of an artifact .",
    "such spectra are not immediately excluded but are flagged as potential cosmic ray hit candidates .",
    "emission - line objects ( see figure [ specs_cfs](h ) ) are identified later .    in the next step ,",
    "several properties of the ccf between the observed spectrum and the synthetic template are calculated and evaluated .",
    "the template spectrum is interpolated based on the library of synthetic spectra by @xcite .",
    "we always construct the ccf using the same template . in our experience",
    ", this allows for an easier classification of unusual spectra ( e.g. , coronal emission , binaries , etc . ) because in those cases the resulting ccf is not influenced by the erroneous formally best - matching normal star template , calculated by the parameter estimation pipeline . for the template we use the average case of a dwarf with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 ( i.e. , close to solar values ) .",
    "the calculation of the ccf is done with the same template for all observed spectra .",
    "this means that the peaks of ccfs of hotter stars , for example , will be weaker but it is of no concern since we are only interested in the particular shape of the ccf and not in its strength . for the same reason , the exact values of the selected atmospheric parameters of the template spectrum are not important and the properties of the ccf do not depend strongly on the values of those parameters .",
    "the observed spectrum is then re - binned to the template s wavelength range for an easier calculation .",
    "z08 also showed that the projected rotational velocity @xmath19 is not recoverable for a slowly rotating star while the amount of @xmath20-enhancement ( [ @xmath20/fe ] ) is unreliable and can not be trusted for individual objects .",
    "therefore , both parameters are set to zero .",
    "another reason why a more careful selection of rotational velocity is not important is the fact that the width of the core of the ccf is much wider than the error of the typical rotational velocity estimate .",
    "the wings of the ccf contain information about the oscillations of the spectral continuum . by comparing the asymptotic values of the wings , it is possible to eliminate all spectra that have uneven continuum and are unsuitable for modeling .",
    "figure  [ specs_cfs](b ) shows a relatively high s / n spectrum with a strongly oscillating continuum .",
    "while the left wing converges to zero as it does in the case of a well - behaved single star spectrum , the right one does not .",
    "the difference of the two levels is a useful method for the detection of badly normalized spectra .",
    "distinguishing between different types of stellar objects ( e.g. , binary stars , emission stars , fast rotators ) is harder than detecting spectra plagued by observational and systematic errors .",
    "spectral features in the former might look similar in some cases ( split major lines in spectra of stars with chromospheric emission and double - lined binary spectra , for example ) . counting",
    "the number of peaks of the ccfs is extremely efficient in the detection of potential sb2 binaries ( figure  [ specs_cfs](c ) ) .",
    "if the ccf has more than one central peak , the spectrum is clearly double - lined and probably comes from an sb2 . in the case of blended sb2-like spectra , the ccf does not show two distinct peaks but is still asymmetric ( figure  [ specs_cfs](d ) ) . unfortunately , ccfs of spectra of stars with chromospheric emission ( figure  [ specs_cfs](f ) ) look similar to the previous case . discriminating between those two classes",
    "is possible by measuring the width of the ccf and the level of asymmetry .",
    "the width of the ccf for a spectrum showing chromospheric emission cores is equal to that of the underlying star without the emission line cores .",
    "the level of asymmetry is calculated by comparing the area under the left and right half of the ccf .",
    "it turns out that ccfs of blended binary candidates are wider and more asymmetric than those of stars with emission line cores .",
    "the border values were set by inspecting a visually classified sample of both types .",
    "stars with emission line cores usually have stronger narrow metallic lines that help to distinguish between both types . in cases where spectral lines of an sb2 candidate are too blended ,",
    "the detection of binarity is impossible .",
    "further details on this topic are described in the following section .",
    "wide and shallow spectral lines are a signature of hot stars , where the otherwise dominant triplet is weak or absent and lines from the hydrogen paschen series dominate .",
    "the ccf between such a spectrum and a template spectrum of a colder dwarf is wide and with low amplitude ( figure  [ specs_cfs](g ) ) .",
    "since lines get wider and shallower with increasing temperature , it becomes increasingly difficult to recognize sb2 binary candidates among early a - type and hotter stars , even if they are observed at quadratures and close to edge - on inclinations .",
    "fortunately , the fraction of hot stars among the high galactic latitude field rave stars is almost negligible . relatively low amplitude and very wide ccfs are also observed in spectra of contact binaries .",
    "most of the lines in such spectra display very little contrast with the underlying continuum : in addition to their intrinsic shallowness they are further widened by rapid rotation ( figure  [ specs_cfs](e ) ) .",
    "they too can be recognized by inspecting the asymmetry of the ccf .",
    "fast rotating stars are anothertype of object that shows similar ccfs . according to @xcite ,",
    "the average projected rotational velocity becomes significant ( greater than @xmath21 on average ) for stars earlier than type f5 , setting a limit at @xmath22 .",
    "if some wide - lined spectrum that does not have a clear two - peaked ccf has a temperature above this limit , it is considered to be a fast rotator rather than a blended binary .",
    "peculiar types of stars are harder to classify since spectral features of such objects span a wide range of appearances .",
    "ccfs of special cases ( figures  [ specs_cfs](h)-(j ) ) all look different from normal single star spectra .",
    "all such peculiar objects were flagged and later eye - checked to avoid any misclassification .",
    "a detailed description of the classification procedure along with the computer code is available upon request from the authors .",
    "in this section we explore which parameters have the largest impact on the probability of detection of an sb2 or a peculiar star spectrum in the rave spectra sample .",
    "we also determine the limits of parameter space beyond which their detection is no longer .",
    "it is desired that the synthetic sample mimics the observed one as closely as possible .",
    "we expect that metallicity ( [ m / h ] ) and barycentric radial velocity are both distributed the same way for binary stars as they are for single stars , with the latter values measured by z08 .",
    "the similarity between the metallicity distribution among single and binary stars is discussed by @xcite .",
    "additionally , we expect that both components should have roughly the same chemical composition and are both of the same age .",
    "although in the rave survey the number of dwarfs and giants is roughly similar , we assumed that only main - sequence binary stars are likely to be double - lined . for binaries of intermediate masses",
    "it is highly unlikely to find one consisting of two giant components .",
    "there are two reasons for this : ( 1 ) to reach the giant stage at the same time , two stars must be almost equally massive ( to within @xmath15 ) and ( 2 ) the lifespan of a giant is much shorter than the lifespan of a dwarf .",
    "combining both criteria makes the probability of finding a giant - giant sb2 very small .",
    "additionally , the morphology of a spectrum of a giant star is similar to a spectrum of a dwarf star with similar effective temperature .",
    "so even if we would be dealing with an sb2 spectrum of two giants , the classification method should not have any trouble recognizing that .    as a starting point for constructing a synthetic binary spectrum we took a distribution of temperature , metallicity and radial velocity for single star dwarfs where we only included spectra with @xmath23 and @xmath24 from the observed sample of 222,563 stars ( from the internal release not yet publicly available ) that had been previously confirmed as normal single stars by the classification method .",
    "after drawing random picks for the first star s temperature @xmath25 and @xmath26}$ ] from those distributions both values were randomly varied for typical errors of both measurements , @xmath27 and @xmath28}=0.2 $ ] .",
    "this was done in order to make both distributions smoother . using the two values we found a complete set of parameters ( mass , radius and @xmath29 magnitude ) for the first star from a yonsai - yale isochrone @xcite of appropriate iron abundance and an age of @xmath30 .",
    "this particular age was chosen so that all stars are already settled on the main sequence and the hotter ones still did not have time to turn to giants , setting the corresponding upper mass cutoff at approximately 3 solar masses .",
    "the age dependence of the stellar parameters for the stars on the main sequence can be neglected and the selection of the age of the isochrone is not very important .",
    "similarly , we also neglected the minor effect of @xmath20-enhancement and its value was kept fixed at zero during the calculation of all spectra .",
    "this provides us with all the necessary parameters for the construction of the synthetic spectrum of the first component .",
    "now we randomly select a luminosity ratio @xmath31 , which is defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the brighter star s and the fainter star s @xmath29 magnitudes , respectively .",
    "this ratio is selected from an interval of @xmath35 $ ] . from there on it is straightforward to find the position on the same isochrone with a matching @xmath29 magnitude of the second component .",
    "distributions of stellar masses , radii , mass ratios and luminosity ratios in the final sample are shown in figure  [ sample_dists_2 ] .",
    "the orbital period was chosen randomly from a distribution fitted to observations in @xcite , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 and @xmath39 is in days .",
    "a similar distribution was also found in numerical simulations of star cluster evolution by @xcite .",
    "a limit on the short period was selected at @xmath40 , because the period distribution for eclipsing binary stars in @xcite shows a strong cutoff there . on the longer end",
    "we took a generous limit of two years . at such long orbital periods the orbital velocities",
    "become so small that the fraction of detectable binaries becomes negligible . for a binary system of two solar twins on a circular orbit ,",
    "the maximal velocity amplitude is equal to @xmath21 for a period of two years . knowing the orbital period , the semimajor axis and orbital velocities were calculated using kepler s third law .",
    "we assumed that all systems have circular orbits .",
    "this only holds true for very short period systems @xmath41 .",
    "the eccentricity of systems with @xmath42 can be significant with a mean of about 0.3 , according to @xcite . nevertheless , the differences of orbital velocities of such systems compared to the velocities of similar systems with circular orbits are in small most cases , justifying the upper assumption .",
    "the orbital phase and orbital inclination to the line of sight were selected randomly .",
    "the rotational velocities of both stars were calculated by assuming that the stars co - rotate with the system s orbital rotation .",
    "the minimal rotational velocity was set at @xmath43 , similar to the value typically obtained by rave s parameter estimation pipeline for slowly rotating single stars .",
    "while this value is unrealistically high , it simulates the marginally lower resolving power of the observed spectra compared to the synthetic ones , where the difference is easily compensated for by slightly wider lines of faster rotators .",
    "some of the close binary systems were removed from the simulation since their rotational velocity exceeded the highest velocity supported by the spectra library from @xcite .",
    "the overall number of such systems is very small and their omission should not affect the end results of the simulation .",
    "synthetic spectra were then scaled according to the luminosity ratio @xmath31 , doppler - shifted to their projected orbital velocities , summed and normalized , and finally , the barycentric radial velocity drawn from the distribution shown in figure  [ sample_dists ] was applied . to simulate the observational errors ,",
    "gaussian noise was added to the binary spectrum according to the randomly selected value of s /",
    "n from the distribution also shown in figure  [ sample_dists ] .",
    "errors in the normalization of the continuum were simulated by introducing five cosine functions with random phases , frequencies , and amplitudes matching typical variations in observed spectra .",
    "we generated @xmath44 such binary spectra that were then classified with the method described in the previous section .",
    "one of the results yielded by the simulations is the distribution of system periods at which the binarity is detectable .",
    "the limitations on the short- and long - period ends come from two different factors .",
    "the spectral lines of short - period binaries are widened because of the co - rotation of both components .",
    "another reason for the widening is velocity smearing during the exposure which becomes significant only for the systems with the shortest periods ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "combining both effects can blend the lines of even a relatively well separated system , making detection more difficult . on the long period end",
    "the detection probability is affected by the limited resolving power of the spectrograph and the fact that binarity detection strongly depends on the noticeable double peaks of the relatively wide triplet lines .",
    "for example , a binary system of solar twins orbiting around each other on a circular orbit with a period of one year and seen along a line of sight close to orbital plane is just on the threshold of detection when observed at a quarter phase .",
    "figure  [ period_hist ] compares the distribution of the input binary systems and those recovered by our analysis .",
    "the dashed lines show the distribution of periods given in equation  ( [ eq_period_distribution ] ) , while the shaded gray histogram shows the input period distribution .",
    "the systems with the shortest periods are missing partly because it was not possible to model spectra of fast rotating cool stars and partly because we removed all systems that exhibited roche overflow , i.e. , in which the stellar radii became greater than the radius of the roche lobe @xmath46 given by @xcite , @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the semimajor axis and @xmath49 denotes the mass ratio .",
    "the solid line in figure  [ period_hist ] shows the number of systems that were confirmed as binaries by our classification method .",
    "the number of modeled systems is small below @xmath50 and predictions there should not be trusted .",
    "the detection ratio becomes very high for systems with periods between 1 and @xmath51 . for systems with periods",
    "between 10 and @xmath52 the detection rate is still significant . for @xmath53",
    "the number of recovered binaries rapidly drops , becoming negligible at @xmath54 .",
    "the dependence of the ratio between the number of properly classified and all binary systems ( detection ratio ) on various parameters is shown in figure  [ detection_ratio ] .",
    "for all synthetic spectra the classification was done at only one orbital phase , i.e. , for a `` single shot . ''",
    "a tight relation between mass ratio @xmath49 and luminosity ratio @xmath31 comes from the fact that only main sequence stars were included in the simulation sample .",
    "more interestingly , both s / n diagrams ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) show that the detection is almost independent of the s / n as long as @xmath57 or equivalently @xmath58 .",
    "the detection ratio is equal to the simulation average of @xmath59 .",
    "a slightly worse detection is observed at @xmath60 , while the seemingly lower detection ratio at @xmath61 is a consequence of the small number of such systems in the simulation .",
    "the detection clearly depends strongly on the system period @xmath39 and the difference between the projections of the orbital velocities of stars @xmath62 .",
    "the detection ratio is higher than 80 percent for @xmath63 as long as @xmath57 .",
    "it seems that it begins to decrease at shorter periods but this again comes from the fact that very few systems were modeled in this region . for @xmath64 ,",
    "the detection is still better than @xmath65 and falls toward 0 at roughly @xmath54 .",
    "the unexpectedly high yield of binaries at short periods and @xmath66 can be explained as the result of the incorrect classification of rapidly rotating cool stars as blended binaries .",
    "the same properties can be seen on the diagrams that show the dependence of the detection ratio on the velocity difference . at @xmath67",
    "the probability of detection is greater than @xmath68 as long as @xmath57 .",
    "observed spectra sometimes have a slightly lower resolving power than the model ones because of non - optimal focusing .",
    "taking that into account it is safe to take @xmath69 as a lower limit .",
    "below that value the probability for detection quickly vanishes .",
    "the simulation shows that the target population consists mostly of binary systems with relatively well separated spectral lines ( @xmath70 ) and mass ratios close to unity ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "consequently , this implies that only shorter period binaries with @xmath72 will be detected , independent of the s / n , and additionally justifies the circular orbit assumption .",
    "since the orbital period is not measurable from a single observation , it is convenient to plot the distribution of orbital periods for all systems with a given @xmath62 ( shown in figure  [ p_dist ] ) .",
    "the range of orbital periods at lower velocities is greater than at higher velocities , meaning that it is possible to guess the system s period more precisely for binaries with better separated lines .",
    "the fraction of sb2 binaries that are classified as normal single stars in the observed sample is of minor concern for studies of galactic structure .",
    "mistakenly treating a blended sb2 spectrum as a single one does not yield extremely wrong results because the centroid of the blended correlation peaks should be close to the systemic velocity . as for the atmospheric parameters ,",
    "the similarity of both components ensures that the single star spectrum fit will still be some average of both spectra and will thus not be far from the proper solution for each component .",
    "usually , only the rotation velocity is overestimated , but this parameter is not measurable from rave spectra with noteworthy precision anyway .",
    "we ran our automated classification method on the 23,321 stars in the rave second data release ( z08 ) with computed atmospheric parameters and an s / n@xmath73 .",
    "a total of 467 spectra was labeled as sb2 candidates . upon checking all of them manually ,",
    "only 129 of them ( belonging to 123 different stars ) could undoubtedly be confirmed as sb2 candidates , implying a success rate of 0.3 . for 102 of these 129 spectra ,",
    "the automated classification was able to measure the separation in radial velocity , the individual temperatures and the luminosity ratio .",
    "these data are summarized in table  [ table_binary_solutions ] .",
    "the first six columns of the table report the star and spectrum identification as given in the rave second data release ( accessible through www.rave-survey.org ) , s / n is the spectrum signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath62 is the difference between red and blue doppler - shifted lines , @xmath74 error is an error of that estimate , and @xmath31 is the luminosity ratio of the less luminous to the more luminous component . @xmath25 and @xmath75 are blueshifted and redshifted component s effective temperatures , respectively .",
    "the 27 spectra for which the automated procedure could not reliably derive the separation in orbital velocity , the luminosity ratio and temperatures of the two stars are given in table [ table_binary_list ] .",
    "all 22,854 spectra classified as `` normal single stars '' by the automated procedure were checked manually one by one , and none of them appeared to be an undetected sb2 candidate . we can conclude that the automated procedure has been successfully detecting essentially all genuine sb2 candidate spectra present in the rave second data release .",
    "the extra spectra picked out by the automated procedure are spurious detections caused by cool stars with wider than usual absorption lines .",
    "the preliminary eye - inspection check carried out on the sample of rave second data release flagged 107 stars as potential sb2 objects .",
    "our automatic classifications confirmed 71 of them .",

    "the common way of finding the best fitting solution is to define a criterion for the goodness of fit , which is usually the sum of squares of the difference between the observed ( @xmath76 ) and modeled ( @xmath77 ) spectra , where the sum goes through all wavelength bins .",

    "this method has two big advantages over more traditional algorithms like the nelder - mead simplex .",
    "the final solution of the latter depends on the initial starting point on the grid of synthetic spectra .",
    "moreover , because we are using a linear interpolation of synthetic spectra between the grid points , descending methods have a bias for finding a solution close to some grid point .",
    "parameter space sampling methods on the other hand have a better feel for the area surrounding the global minimum and therefore a better chance of finding it .",
    "unfortunately , none of the tested methods gave reasonable results in performing a completely unconstrained fitting .",
    "it often happened that the method returned a solution consisting of a giant and a dwarf both with similar temperatures and a luminosity ratio close to unity .",
    "while this solution might formally be the best - fitting one , it is still not physically feasible and can not be trusted . to overcome the problem we limited the solutions to the main - sequence stars , same as we did in the construction of the synthetic sample for the described simulation ( see  [ sec_synthetic_sample ] ) .",

    "generally , they are larger for blended cases , where positions of lines are harder to locate and for faster rotating stars that have wider lines . errors on individual spectral types and luminosity ratio were estimated from four re - observations .",

    "the average effective temperature difference between the two solutions for the same object is equal to @xmath78 with a standard deviation of @xmath79 , similar to what is returned by the multinest method .",

    "it is likely that all of them are close binary systems .",
    "the spectrum of hd 101167 is particularly interesting since it shows three components ( bottom plot in figure  [ indv_specs ] ) .",
    "three lines as well as the @xmath87 and @xmath88 lines are clearly triple .",
    "the best - fitting solution suggests that the system consists of two early type g stars at roughly @xmath89 and one late type g star at @xmath90 .",
    "a proposed explanation is a hierarchically ordered triple system with a fainter and cooler star orbiting around the center of mass of a closer system of two hotter components .",
    "hd 101167 is extraordinarily similar to the triple g - type system cn lyn , already studied over the rave wavelength range by @xcite .",
    "this paper presents a method to identify sb2 candidate spectra among a sample of stellar spectra covering the near - ir triplet region at a resolution of @xmath91 , and a list of discovered binaries in the latest rave data release . from repeated observations of the same objects it is also possible to detect sb1 spectra , which will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "joining both types will give a basis for the population study of binary stars in the rave survey .    the classification method based on the ccf proved to work efficiently for the detection of potential double - lined spectroscopic binaries .",
    "the gain of discovered sb2 binary candidates in the selected dr2 sample of the rave survey was small compared to other higher resolution surveys , but still significant .",
    "out of 25,850 examined spectra we discovered 123 ( @xmath92 ) unique sb2 candidate spectra .",
    "only seven were previously known .",
    "if we extrapolate this ratio to the entire rave sample and assume that the majority of candidate spectra indeed belong to binaries , more than 2000 new sb2 binaries of different kinds will be discovered in the upcoming data releases and will be treated in forthcoming papers .",
    "the list of discovered binaries also includes several unusual objects . among them",
    "are a few binary spectra that show signs of chromospheric activity , several close or contact binaries and a triple system hd 101167 .",
    "the detection simulation performed on a large representative sample of synthetic binary spectra showed that the majority of short period binaries @xmath93 are discovered if the luminosity ratio is @xmath94 . assuming that most of the binaries lie along the main sequence the luminosity ratio translates to a mass ratio of @xmath95 . at longer periods",
    "the detection rate gets progressively smaller , and finally at around @xmath54 the probability for detection vanishes .",
    "fitting the selected sample of binary spectra proved that it is possible to measure doppler shifts with errors comparable to the rv errors of single stars .",
    "the solutions for temperatures and surface gravities from which we derived spectral types were unreliable when fitting the spectra completely unconstrained .",
    "we got better results with the assumed main - sequence solutions for both components .",
    "there is still room for improvement .",
    "using a more sophisticated model than only a main - sequence assumption could provide even more reliable information on spectral types and also on chemical composition of binaries .",
    "other comparable large - scale spectroscopic surveys are the geneva - copenhagen ( gc ) survey @xcite and the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "while the latter is not suited for sb2 observation due to a low resolving power , the former was particularly successful with binary detection .",
    "@xcite reported that out of @xmath96 stars around @xmath97 were either visual or spectroscopic binaries and 510 ( @xmath98 ) of them showed double lines .",
    "the detection of such a high fraction of binaries was possible because of several repeated observations of each object in the longer time span and because of the better resolution of the coravel spectrometer .",
    "we ran the detection simulation with the same distribution of re - observations as in the gc survey and the efficiency of sb2 detection was approximately @xmath65 higher than in the case of only one observation per object .",
    "unfortunately , the number of discovered sb2 spectra in the gc survey with velocity difference greater than @xmath99 is not available so a direct comparison of efficiency between the gc and rave surveys can not be done",
    ".    the described classification method could also be useful for the forthcoming gaia mission .",
    "the spectral data provided by the mission will be very similar to the rave data , meaning the method will be applicable without any significant modifications .",
    "the enormous scale of gaia observations and the fact that each object will be observed many times during the lifetime of the mission will yield a large amount of potential new sb2 objects .",

    "<S> we devise a new method for the detection of double - lined binary stars in a sample of the radial velocity experiment ( rave ) survey spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the method is both tested against extensive simulations based on synthetic spectra , and compared to direct visual inspection of all rave spectra . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on the properties and shape of the cross - correlation function , and is able to recover @xmath0 of all binaries with an orbital period of order @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> systems with periods up to @xmath2 are still within the detection reach . </S>",
    "<S> we have applied the method to 25,850 spectra of the rave second data release and found 123 double - lined binary candidates , only eight of which are already marked as binaries in the simbad database . among the candidates , </S>",
    "<S> there are seven that show spectral features consistent with the rs cvn type ( solar type with active chromosphere ) and seven that might be of w uma type ( over - contact binaries ) . </S>",
    "<S> one star , hd 101167 , seems to be a triple system composed of three nearly identical g - type dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> the tested classification method could also be applicable to the data of the upcoming _ gaia _ mission . </S>"
