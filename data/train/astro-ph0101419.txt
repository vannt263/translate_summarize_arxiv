    "neutral hydrogen along the line of sight to distant quasars produces numerous lyman alpha ( ly@xmath0 ) absorption features in quasar spectra , known as the ly@xmath0   forest \" @xcite . at redshifts @xmath12 , high - resolution optical spectroscopy with hires @xcite on the keck 10 m telescope has enabled the statistics of ly@xmath0  absorbers to be determined to high precision @xcite .",
    "recent observations using uves at the vlt have probed absorbers at redshifts @xmath13 @xcite . in conjunction with these observations ,",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) have forwarded a self - consistent physical picture for the origin of ly@xmath0  forest absorbers ( @xmath14 ) , in which they arise from highly photoionized gas tracing the dark matter potentials in mildly nonlinear large - scale structures ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",

    "* ) captures the essential physics of optically - thin ly@xmath0  absorbers : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the optical depth , @xmath17 is the local density of baryons ( assumed to trace the dark matter ) , and @xmath18 is the photoionization rate . the fgpa has been utilized in various forms to constrain many physical parameters associated with high - redshift ly@xmath0  forest absorption , such as a measurement of @xmath19 @xcite and the mass power spectrum at @xmath20 @xcite , and implicitly in the determination of the metallicity of the diffuse igm @xcite and the  equation of state \" of the igm @xcite .    at redshifts @xmath21 ,",
    "the ly@xmath0  transition falls in the ultraviolet , requiring more challenging space - based observation .",
    "the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ quasar absorption line key project @xcite obtained uv quasar spectra for a large sample of quasars @xcite using the _ hst _ faint object spectrograph ( fos ) . unlike keck / hires , fos is unable to resolve individual ly@xmath0  absorption features , having a resolution of @xmath22  km / s .",
    "nevertheless , this sample greatly expanded our understanding of the properties and evolution of ly@xmath0  forest absorbers from @xmath23 .",
    "one surprising result was that the rate of evolution of absorbers slows dramatically at @xmath24 ; this was initially indicated by the large number of ly@xmath0 lines detected in the first observations of 3c 373 @xcite and confirmed with a larger number of sight lines from the fos key project @xcite .",
    "cosmological hydrodynamic simulations suggested that this was a result of the diminishing ionizing background in concert with the decline in the quasar population after @xmath25 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter dhkw ) .",
    "fos data also suggested that high - column density absorbers are evolving away faster than low - column density ones @xcite , which dhkw suggested was due to the increase in the relative cross - section of lower - column absorbing gas .",
    "dhkw also showed that the observed correlation between absorber equivalent width and impact parameter @xcite arises purely due to the clustering of matter , not due to a physical association of absorbers with in large gaseous halos of individual galaxies .",
    "thus qualitatively , ly@xmath0  absorbers at low redshift are well - described by current structure formation models .",
    "still , due to the low resolution of fos and the computational difficulty of running simulations to @xmath26 , a detailed quantitative agreement of simulations with observations analogous to that obtained at high redshift has yet to be achieved .    _",
    "hst s _ goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) has yielded some complementary results regarding low-@xmath7 ly@xmath0  absorbers . in the intermediate - resolution mode usually employed in qso absorption line studies ,",
    "the ghrs provided an instrumental resolution of @xmath2719  km / s , which is comparable to the widths of ly@xmath0  lines , making a determination of individual absorber column densities and @xmath3-parameters possible , though not straightforward @xcite .",
    "the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ can be used to detect higher lyman series lines at wavelengths shortward of the _ hst _ bandpass and thereby enable a curve - of - growth analysis to more accurately estimate line widths @xcite .",
    "the resulting widths were typically half of that obtained by direct profile fitting of ghrs data , which @xcite interpreted as an indication of non - thermal components in ly@xmath0  absorbers .",
    "the deployment of the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) aboard _ hst _ has significantly improved our ability to study low - redshift ly@xmath0  absorbers .",
    "the intermediate - resolution fuv echelle mode of stis has a resolution of 7  km / s fwhm and enables detection of absorbers with @xmath28 .",
    "this resolution , similar to that of keck / hires , allows virtually all ly@xmath0  absorbers to be fully resolved , facilitating a robust comparison with high - resolution hydrodynamic simulations . in this paper",
    "we determine the column density and linewidth distributions from stis spectra of quasars pg  0953 + 415 ( @xmath29 = 0.239 ) and h1821 + 643 ( @xmath29 = 0.297 ) , and we compare them to carefully - constructed mock quasar spectra drawn from a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation of a @xmath2cdm universe .",
    "we find that the agreement between simulations and observations is quite good , and lends strong support to the physical picture of the low - redshift intergalactic medium provided by hierarchical structure formation models .",
    "dhkw suggested that the physical state of the gas giving rise to ly@xmath0  absorption at low redshift is fundamentally similar to that at high redshift , with the exceptions that a dynamically equivalent patch of gas at low redshift gives rise to an absorber with significantly lower column density ( see their figure  10 ) , and collisionally ionized hot gas plays an increasingly important role to lower redshift .",
    "with stis data , we can now probe these low-@xmath30 absorbers that are predicted to be physically similar to the high-@xmath7 forest absorbers .",
    "if the fgpa provides a reasonable description of weak low-@xmath7 absorbers , it may be possible to apply many of the same techniques used to determine physical properties of the igm at high redshift to stis data . in this paper",
    "we present such applications , including an estimate of the extragalactic photoionization rate . despite large systematic uncertainties in the modeling ,",
    "our measurement is among the most sensitive to date .    in  [ sec :",
    "sims ] we describe the stis observations of the two low - redshift quasars , the hydrodynamic simulations we will use for comparison , and the construction and analysis of artificial spectra . in  [ sec : stats ] we present the column density and line width distribution from stis data alongside the distributions from carefully - constructed artificial spectra . in ",
    "[ sec : phys ] we explore the physical state of gas giving rise to the sorts of absorbers seen in these stis spectra , and make a preliminary determination of the igm temperature from the @xmath31 distribution . in ",

    "we present our conclusions in  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "the stis observations of pg0953 + 415 and h1821 + 643 were obtained by @xcite and @xcite to study low - redshift absorbers as well as the relationships between the various types of absorption systems and galaxies .",
    "after the publication of those papers , more observations were obtained , and modest improvements in the data reduction procedures were implemented . a detailed description of the observations , data reduction , and complete line lists are found in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "here we provide a brief summary .",
    "both qsos were observed with the medium resolution fuv echelle mode ( e140 m ) .",
    "h1821 + 643 was observed with the @xmath32 slit , while pg0953 + 415 was observed with the @xmath33 slit for better throughput .",
    "this stis mode provides a resolution of @xmath34 46,000 ( 7 km / s fwhm ) with the @xmath32 slit @xcite ; the fwhm is only slightly degraded with the @xmath35 slit , but the broad wings of the line spread function are more prominent ( see figure 13.87 in the stis instrument handbook , v4.1 ) .",
    "this mode provides spectra extending from 1150 @xmath36 1710   with only a few small gaps between orders at @xmath37 1630  , redwards of the ly@xmath0  forest .",
    "the data were reduced with the stis instrument definition team software .",
    "the individual spectra were flatfielded , extracted , and wavelength and flux calibrated with the standard techniques .",
    "then a correction for scattered light was applied using the method developed by the stis team , and the individual spectra were combined with weighting based on signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "finally , overlapping regions of adjacent orders were also coadded weighted by s / n .",
    "we employ a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation of a @xmath2-dominated cold dark matter model , run with ptreesph @xcite , having @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , inflationary spectral index @xmath42 , and rms fluctuation amplitude @xmath43 .",
    "we use @xmath44 dark matter particles and @xmath44 gas particles in a periodic cube 11.111@xmath45  comoving mpc on a side and a gravitational softening length of 3.5@xmath45  comoving kpc ( equivalent plummer softening ) .",
    "further details may be found in dhkw .",
    "we choose @xmath19 to match recent observations of the deuterium abundance @xcite , and adopt a uv background from @xcite . in post - processing",
    "we adjusted the intensity of the uv background slightly in order to match the evolution of the number density of absorbers ( @xmath46 ) with rest equivalent width @xmath47  ( the  matched lcdm \" curve in figure  4 of dhkw ) , by assuming the optical depth in artificial spectra is inversely proportional to the photoionization rate .",
    "this simulation is otherwise the same as the  lcdm \" run in dhkw .    from this simulation",
    "we generate artificial spectra whose characteristics closely model those of pg0953 + 415 and h1821 + 643 ; see @xcite for a more detailed description of this procedure .",
    "we assume zero metallicity , so all features in the artificial spectra are lyman series lines .",
    "the flux is interpolated to the wavelength of each pixel in the observed spectrum , and gaussian random noise is added based on the noise value at the nearest pixel in the observed spectrum with a similar flux .",
    "we convolve the spectrum with the stis line spread function of the slit used to observed each quasar , interpolated to the pixels wavelength .",
    "we fit a continuum to both observed and artificial spectra using a median filter in a sliding 100-pixel ( @xmath48  km / s ) window .",
    "we adjust the median filter so that in each set of artificial spectra , there is on average no net flux subtracted by the continuum fitting ( i.e. we recover the true continuum , on average ) .",
    "we generate 20 artificial spectra for each quasar , for a total of 40 .",
    "we fit voigt profiles to the observed and artificial spectra using autovp @xcite .",
    "we choose a @xmath49 detection threshold for identifying ly@xmath0  absorbers , using the procedure described in @xcite with a 20  km / s detection window .",
    "we only consider lines between the ly@xmath0  and ly@xmath50 emission peaks so as to reduce confusion with higher - order lyman series and metal lines , and do not include any absorbers within 5000  km / s of the ly@xmath0  emission peak .",
    "spectral regions containing galactic ism lines or extragalactic metal lines identified in the data are discarded , and any lines identified in the artificial spectra in those wavelength regions are discarded as well , ensuring that each artificial spectrum has the same redshift path length as its corresponding quasar spectrum . note that considerable care must be exercised in the identification of the milky way features since the spectra have sufficient sensitivity to show weak ism lines such as the and resonance transitions ; similarly , several extragalactic metal lines are present in the wavelength range of interest ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an 80  sample of h1821 + 643 is shown in figure  1 , at three stages .",
    "the first ( top panel ) shows the unnormalized observed spectrum , with the continuum fit as the thick solid line , and the @xmath51 noise vector at the bottom .",
    "the middle panel shows the normalized spectrum with voigt profile identifications indicated by the tick marks ( some of the marked lines are milky way or extragalactic metal lines which are discarded ) .",
    "the bottom panel shows the corresponding segment from an artificial h1821 + 643 spectrum , with the same analysis procedure having been applied .",
    "while there may be biases associated with our particular continuum fitting , line identification , and voigt profile fitting algorithms , the application of the identical routines to both simulations and observations facilitates a fair comparison between the two .",
    "we do not expect these biases to be significant since we are fully resolving virtually all ly@xmath0  absorbers , and continuum fitting is relatively straightforward since the low-@xmath7 forest is sparse .",
    "any systematic biases that do arise will , in most cases , be reflected equally in the statistics of both the simulations and observations .",
    "our @xmath52mpc simulation volume is small compared to the scale of linearity at @xmath26 , hence our derived statistics are subject to cosmic variance .",
    "we do not attempt to estimate this , since to do so would require running a suite of simulations that is beyond our current capabilities .",
    "we note that our randomly chosen volume is typical , containing no anomalously large mass concentrations or voids .",
    "as we will show , most ly@xmath0  absorbers arise in moderate overdensity regions that are well - sampled even within our small volume , though the contribution from coupling to waves larger than our boxsize is not included .",
    "we leave a systematic study of these effects for future work .",
    "the distributions of column densities and doppler widths @xmath3 obtained by fitting voigt profiles to spectral features have historically been used to characterize the statistics of ly@xmath0  forest absorbers . though these statistics reflect the old paradigm that ly@xmath0  absorbers arise from isolated thermally - broadened clouds , an assumption that is likely to be incorrect in detail ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such statistics still represent a fair statistical characterization of the absorber population , more so at low redshift than at high redshift because line blending is less severe and individual absorbers can more easily be identified .    at high redshift",
    ", statistics based on the distribution of flux in the ly@xmath0  forest have gained favor ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) due to their simplicity , ease of implementation , and robustness of comparison with models . at low redshift , these statistics are somewhat more difficult to apply reliably , because they require that the opacity in the forest be predominantly due to ly@xmath0  absorption , whereas at low-@xmath7 the relative contribution from metal and ism lines is greatly increased .",
    "thus we will leave flux statistics for future work , and focus here on voigt profile statistics .",
    "we identify 33 ly@xmath0  absorption lines in the ly@xmath0  region of pg0953 + 415 , and 56 in h1821 + 643 , using autovp .",
    "there are more absorbers in h1821 + 643 because the average signal - to - noise ratio per @xmath53  km / s pixel in this wavelength range is higher , s / n@xmath54 compared to @xmath55 for pg0953 + 415 , so more weak absorbers are indentified .",
    "the total redshift path length is @xmath56 for pg0953 + 415 and @xmath57 for h1821 + 643 , not including discarded regions that cover @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "this path length is for absorbers above our completeness limit , which we will show is @xmath5 ; for weaker absorbers , the effective path length is smaller ( see , for example , the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but by construction is still identical in the data and the artificial spectra .",
    "we will only quote statistics for absorbers above our completeness limit .",
    "the mean redshift of our entire absorber sample is @xmath10 .",
    "the column density distribution is defined as the number of lines per unit redshift @xmath7 per unit column density @xmath30 , and is generally parameterized as a power law in @xmath30 , @xmath60 at @xmath12 , @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "recent work with vlt / uves suggests a similar slope ( @xmath62 ) down to @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "this is predicted to steepen significantly at low redshift ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "ghrs observations by @xcite indicate a somewhat steeper slope of @xmath64 , but that was obtained by assuming a particular @xmath3 for all absorbers ( varied between 20 and 30  km / s ) rather than by determining @xmath3 and @xmath30 independently from profile fitting .",
    "an alternative statement of this trend is that high-@xmath30 absorbers are predicted to evolve away faster than low-@xmath30 ones .",
    "the analysis in  5.2 of @xcite suggests no significant difference between the evolution of absorbers with @xmath65 and @xmath66 , contradicting fos results @xcite as well as model predictions .",
    "however , figure  18 of @xcite suggests that between @xmath67 , stronger absorbers evolve away significantly faster than weaker ones from @xmath68 .",
    "figure  2 shows the column density distribution of identified absorbers in the two stis spectra ( combined ) along with the corresponding results from 40 artificial spectra .",
    "the simulations and observations show very good agreement , in both the slope and the amplitude of @xmath69 .",
    "the best - fit slopes for @xmath70 are @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "thus we find that the the column density distribution has steepened considerably since @xmath20 , at least for absorbers with @xmath73 , in general agreement with figure  18 of @xcite .",
    "we do find a slope that is somewhat steeper ( by @xmath74 ) than that found from the ghrs sample @xcite .",
    "note that we only include @xmath75 bins in this fit ; had we included the bin at @xmath76 , the slopes would reduce to @xmath77 .",
    "this bin is only slightly incomplete ( as we discuss below ) , but it illustrates that completeness must be carefully assessed before an accurate determination of @xmath50 can be made .",
    "the dotted line in figure  2 shows the column density distribution for a set of artificial spectra where the s / n ratio has been increased by a factor of 5 , allowing weaker absorbers to be identified .",
    "no significant differences are seen for @xmath75 .",
    "this tests the completeness of the observations ( and simulations ) at low @xmath30 , showing that the absorber sample in pg0953 + 415 and h1821 + 643 is complete down to @xmath78 , and @xmath79% complete to @xmath80 .",
    "the similar shape of the turnover below this value indicates that the noise level in the artificial spectra are faithfully mimicking that in the stis data .",
    "the agreement in amplitude of @xmath69 depends on the chosen value of the photoionization rate used to generate the artificial spectra , as we will explore further in ",
    "[ sec : ggh ] .",
    "the best - fit amplitudes for the simulated and observed absorbers are @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively .",
    "recall that the ionizing background was set to obtain agreement with @xmath46 of absorbers with @xmath47(@xmath66 ) measured by the key project s sample of fos quasar spectra ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which probes a different column density regime than these stis spectra .",
    "the general agreement between these independent data sets lends further support to the overall model .",
    "the @xmath3-parameter distribution has historically provided a significant challenge for theories of the ly@xmath0  forest . at high redshift ,",
    "absorbers are predominantly broadened by bulk flow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but thermal broadening is not negligible @xcite .",
    "hence the @xmath3-parameter distribution can probe the temperature of ly@xmath0  forest gas @xcite .",
    "the derived temperatures seem to suggest that intergalactic gas at @xmath20 is heated by some other process in addition to equilibrium photoionization , such as helium reionization @xcite . though some observational constraints are beginning to emerge @xcite , theories for when and how reionization occurs are quite uncertain , making an _ a priori _ prediction of @xmath3-parameters difficult .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that a robust prediction of the @xmath3-parameter distribution for comparison with keck / hires data requires exceptionally high numerical resolution @xcite , higher for instance than in the simulation analyzed here .    at low redshift",
    ", it is unclear whether simulation predictions of @xmath3-parameters are more or less robust .",
    "certainly reionization is far enough in the past that the igm is expected to have returned to an equilibrium ionization condition .",
    "however , the character of the low-@xmath7 igm has changed dramatically . in particular , though a substantial fraction of the baryons remains in cool , photoionized gas , a significant component of intergalactic gas now resides at temperatures exceeding that from photoionization , due to shock heating from infall onto large - scale structure ( dhkw ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter d01 ) .",
    "furthermore , it is possible that non - thermal processes such as supernova heating also heat the igm ( * ? ? ?",
    "* though see d01 and croft et al .",
    "the simulation used here includes these physical processes ( it is simulation  d2 \" in d01 ) , but they are more complex than just photoionization heating and adiabatic cooling , involving highly uncertain theoretical issues such as escape fraction of feedback energy and the contribution of small - scale shocks to igm heating ( see d01 for discussion ) .",
    "furthermore , the baryonic mass fraction in various intergalactic components depends on @xmath19 and cosmology ( dhkw ) in a way that is difficult to predict analytically , as we will discuss in  [ sec : ggh ] .    with these caveats in mind ,",
    "we present in figure  3 a comparison of the @xmath3-parameter distribution in our two stis quasar spectra and the artificial spectra .",
    "we only show the distribution for absorbers above our completeness limit of @xmath70 , but including absorbers down to @xmath76 makes little difference in the results .",
    "remarkably , despite all the potential pitfalls , the agreement between simulations and observations is quite good .",
    "the median @xmath3-parameter is observed to be 22  km / s , while the simulations predict 21.5  km / s .",
    "the average @xmath3 is observed to be 25  km / s , and predicted to be 23  km / s .",
    "a k - s test shows no statistically significant difference between the @xmath3 distributions from the observations and simulations .",
    "these quoted values include the contribution from the stis line spread function ; correcting for this lowers these values by @xmath83  km / s , yielding an intrinsic median @xmath3-parameter of @xmath84  km / s .",
    "the dotted line shows the distribution of thermal widths for the artificial sample , which we will discuss in  [ sec : temp ] .    the median @xmath3 value is lower than the @xmath85  km / s typically found at @xmath86 @xcite , though a higher s / n spectrum finds somewhat lower @xmath3 values @xcite",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the prediction that the unshocked igm is cooler at low-@xmath7 due to the lowered intensity of the photoionizing background , but could also be a result of lowered bulk flow broadening due to differential hubble expansion across the absorbing structures .",
    "we will explore the relative importance of these effects in  [ sec : temp ] .",
    "our @xmath3-parameters do not follow an extrapolation of the trend seen by @xcite , that @xmath3 generally increases with decreasing redshift for @xmath87 .",
    "they are also significantly smaller than @xmath3-parameters derived from profile fitting ghrs data ( @xmath88  km / s , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , we are in agreement with a curve - of - growth analysis using fuse and ghrs data by @xcite , who find @xmath89  km / s and @xmath90  km / s .",
    "as we will discuss further in  [ sec : temp ] , larger column density absorbers are wider , and figure  6 shows that at the median @xmath91 of the @xcite sample , our median @xmath3-parameter is @xmath92 .",
    "this agrees quite well with their value of 28  km / s , given the small samples involved .",
    "our stis data probes weaker lines than the fuse sample , and hence results in a smaller median @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite find that , for partially saturated lines , direct profile fitting of ghrs data overstimates the @xmath3-parameter by a factor of two on average , and thereby calls into question the validity of profile fitting .",
    "it is true that results from profile - fitting a saturated ly@xmath0  line can have large uncertainties .",
    "however , the vast majority of our lines are not saturated ( @xmath93 ) , so our statistics , particularly our median @xmath3 value , should not be too sensitive to this effect .",
    "furthermore , as evidenced by our agreement with the curve - of - growth study of @xcite , we are at most only slightly overestimating @xmath3-parameters . the 7  km",
    "/ s resolution of our data insures that we can adequately sample individual ly@xmath0  absorbers profiles , since the smallest ly@xmath0  absorber widths are significantly larger .",
    "note that we do find a number of metal and ism lines that have widths comparable to the resolution @xcite , indicating that if such ly@xmath0  lines existed , they would have been detected .",
    "the agreement of the predicted and observed @xmath3-parameter distributions is actually better than that obtained in a similar comparison at high redshift @xcite .",
    "this surprising result may be because stis observations do not yet have high enough s / n to show discrepancies with the simulations . or it may be that since low-@xmath7 forest requires less deblending of absorption features , the @xmath3-parameter distribution is more robustly predicted .",
    "alternatively , we may have simply been fortunate with this simulation , and future higher - resolution , larger - volume simulations will show discrepancies .",
    "for now we are encouraged by the good agreement , and will proceed on the assumption that it is not a spurious coincidence , but rather reflects the basic validity of the underlying physical model .",
    "the good agreement between the observed and simulated absorber statistics suggests that the simulations are accurately describing the origin of weak ly@xmath0  absorbers at low redshift . in this section",
    ", we investigate the physical conditions in the simulated igm that give rise to weak ly@xmath0  absorbers .",
    "these studies are similar in spirit to those in dhkw , but with a focus on the weak absorber population seen in these stis spectra .",
    "we also investigate the relationship between the @xmath3-parameter distribution and the temperature of the igm .      at high redshift , there is a tight relationship between density @xmath17 and temperature @xmath94 in the gas producing the ly@xmath0  forest , arising from the balance between photoionization heating and adiabatic cooling due to hubble expansion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at low redshift",
    ", shocks have heated a significant fraction of even diffuse intergalactic baryons above the equilibrium photoionization temperatures , diluting this tight relation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * dhkw )",
    ". however , this shock - heated gas tends to have a low ionization fraction , and hence is less likely to give rise to ly@xmath0  absorbers , while a substantial amount of baryonic matter remains in the cool , diffuse igm ( see figure  1 in d01 ) .",
    "thus ly@xmath0",
    "absorbing gas may still have a reasonably tight @xmath95 relation .",
    "figure  4 shows the temperature @xmath94 vs. density @xmath96 of all absorbers identified in our 40 artificial spectra .",
    "the density and temperature of an absorber are taken to be those at the location of the absorber s maximum optical depth , and the density is shown in units of the mean baryonic density at the absorber redshift .",
    "a significant fraction of the absorbers lie along a relatively tight relation in @xmath95 space arising from photoionization , but there are also many shock - heated absorbers at higher @xmath94 .",
    "the photoionized absorbers follow the fitting formula @xmath97 shown as the dashed line , whose slope is similar to that seen at high redshift @xcite . for comparison , we show contours encompassing 50% and 90% of all gas in our simulation . in the density range of stis ly@xmath0  absorbers ,",
    "the absorbers range of temperatures is significantly smaller than that of all baryons .",
    "evidently , ly@xmath0  absorbers preferentially ( though not uniquely ) trace out gas in an equilibrium photoionized state .",
    "the fgpa indicates a power - law relationship between the optical depth and the underlying gas density . at low redshift ,",
    "this relationship becomes contaminated by hot gas that lies off the @xmath95 relation as seen in figure  4 , resulting in absorbers with more widely varying ionization fractions , and hence more widely varying underlying densities .",
    "figure  5 show plots of column density @xmath30 vs. density of underlying gas for the absorbers identified in the 40 artificial spectra . as suggested by figure  10 of dhkw ,",
    "there is substantially greater scatter at low redshift as compared to high redshift .",
    "the line shows a similar fit to that in dhkw , @xmath98 ^{0.7}\\ ; 10^{-0.4 z},\\ ] ] corrected for the difference in @xmath18 used ( discussed further in ",
    "[ sec : ggh ] ) .",
    "this is a reasonable fit to the artificial stis absorbers , though there is a hint of greater scatter than in the @xmath26 absorber population of dhkw .",
    "this may be because dhkw used s / n=30 per pixel , whereas our stis spectra have s / n@xmath99 per pixel , resulting in larger errors in profile fitting to obtain @xmath30 , especially at lower column densities . in figure  5 ,",
    "the left and right panels show the results from h1821-like and pg0953-like artificial spectra , respectively .",
    "the most deviant outliers in density ( at low column densities ) arise in the lower - s / n pg0953-like spectra , indicating that s / n issues may be important .",
    "given the large scatter , it is difficult to unambigously assign an underlying density to an absorber of a given @xmath30 , though a trend clearly exists .",
    "while higher quality data may tighten this relation somewhat , as of now it appears the fgpa is not nearly as tight a relation at low redshift as compared to high-@xmath7 .",
    "thus techniques such as recovery of the mass power spectrum @xcite will face greater challenges in this regime .      since higher column density systems arise from higher density gas , and higher density gas has higher temperatures",
    ", one would expect that @xmath3 should be correlated with @xmath30 .",
    "in particular , the smallest @xmath3 parameters at a given @xmath30 should mainly reflect the temperature of the underlying absorbers , as thermal broadening should dominate in the narrowest lines .",
    "this fact has been used at high redshift to constrain the temperature and  equation of state \" ( i.e. the @xmath95 relation , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the igm @xcite , and a similar argument has been extended to low redshift as well @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that recovering the igm temperature is actually easier at low-@xmath7 , because at high redshift , narrow lines can arise from voigt profile fitting the asymmetric wings of larger lines , and may be confused for true narrow absorbers .",
    "this occurs much less frequently in the sparser low redshift forest .",
    "figure  6 shows a plot of @xmath30 vs. @xmath3 for the absorbers identified in pg0953 + 415 and h1821 + 643 ( left panel ) and absorbers in our artificial spectra ( right panel ) . the dashed curve shows a running median of @xmath3 parameters with @xmath30 , with variance in each bin .",
    "there is a clear trend for larger @xmath3-parameters at larger column densities , as would be expected by the above argument .",
    "we can quantify this relation as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : rhocol ] we confirmed that equation  ( [ eqn : colspa ] ) is a reasonable fit to stis absorbers ( though with large scatter ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : rhot ] ) gives our @xmath95 fit to photoionized absorbers , which are the coolest at any given density .",
    "combining these relations and using @xmath100 for pure thermal broadening , we obtain an estimate for the minimum @xmath3 parameter as a function of column density and redshift : @xmath101 ^{0.21}\\ ; 10^{-0.12z}\\ ;   { \\rm km / s}.\\ ] ] this relation is shown as the solid line in the two panels of figure  6 , for @xmath102 ( the mean redshift of the observed sample ) . it is a good approximation to the lower envelope of absorber @xmath3-parameters for @xmath103 in our artificial spectra ( right panel ) . below this column density , presumably blending is more frequent , and narrow lines from line wings dilute this relationship .",
    "also , noise can cause some weak lines to appear narrower than they really are , since weaker lines have larger profile fitting uncertainties . as seen in the left panel ,",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : bcol ] ) is consistent with a lower envelope for all but the weakest stis absorbers as well , though a larger sample of absorbers will be required before such a relation may be recovered directly from the observations .    comparing the solid line",
    "( pure thermal broadening ) with the dashed line ( median @xmath3 ) in figure  6 suggests that thermal broadening is responsible for a substantial portion of the absorber widths , with @xmath104 for a typical absorber .",
    "this fraction remains fairly constant with @xmath30 .",
    "this is also seen in figure  3 , where the dotted line shows the histogram of thermal widths for @xmath70 absorbers ; its median value is @xmath105  km / s .",
    "the contribution from thermal broadening is therefore greater than at high redshift , where bulk flow broadening dominates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : bcol ] ) was obtained from fits to the particular simulation used here ; it is not true in general . in order to measure the temperature of the igm unambiguously ,",
    "it is important to test equations  ( [ eqn : rhot ] ) and ( [ eqn : colspa ] ) over a wider range of parameter space .",
    "nevertheless , the good agreement with the @xmath3-parameter distribution , as well as the significant contribution of thermal broadening to this distribution , suggests that these simulations are accurately characterizing the  equation of state \" of the low-@xmath7 igm .",
    "our measurement is given by equation  ( [ eqn : rhot ] ) , indicating a temperature of @xmath106  k at the mean density .",
    "increasing the temperature by more than a factor of two would produce thermal @xmath3-parameters alone that are larger than observed , so we place an upper limit at @xmath107k .",
    "since this fit is only for our current simulation , it is subject to the uncertainties in modeling , but at least at high redshift measurements of @xmath94 are not very sensitive to such uncertainties @xcite .",
    "note that we are measuring here the temperature of equilibrium photoionized ly@xmath0  forest absorbers only , and this does not exclude the possibility that the igm contains a component of hotter gas that may give rise to , say , absorption @xcite .",
    "a similar technique has already been used to determine the temperature of the igm from ghrs data , obtaining a value of @xmath108  k for @xmath109 @xcite , in agreement with our result . with more stis data and better simulations ,",
    "this type of analysis should be able to robustly measure the temperature of the low - redshift igm in the near future .",
    "as stated in  [ sec : stats ] , the agreement between the observed and simulated column density distribution amplitude is in principle a test of the ionization state of the absorbing gas . because the absorbing gas for @xmath93 is optically thin , @xmath110 , so changing the ionization fraction of ly@xmath0  forest absorbers will shift the simulated @xmath69 in the horizontal direction , and alter the agreement with observations .",
    "it is straightforward to determine the shift in @xmath30 that produces the best agreement with observations , then translate that into a value for @xmath18 .",
    "this yields @xmath111 at an average redshift of @xmath10 , up by @xmath112  dex from the value of @xmath18 originally used to construct the artificial spectra .",
    "figure  7 shows this value of @xmath18 ( filled circle ) in relation to other predicted and observed values .",
    "the error bars on this value are discussed below .",
    "the value derived here is close to the  matched lcdm \" curve from dhkw ( solid line ) , since it was this @xmath113 that produced the good agreement with the observed @xmath69 seen in figure  2 .",
    "this value is even closer to that predicted from the evolution of the quasar population by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dashed line ) and three - fourths of a similar prediction by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dotted line ) at @xmath102 . a recent calculation accounting for emission from qsos , seyferts and starbursts @xcite",
    "is shown as the diamond at @xmath26 , and is quite consistent with our measurement .",
    "figure  7 also shows various measurements that constrain @xmath18 at low redshift ( a more complete discussion may be found in * ? ? ?",
    "the open circle at @xmath114 comes from the proximity effect @xcite , the open square comes from modeling the radial truncation of in the isolated spiral ngc  3198 @xcite , and the two downward triangles show upper limits from h@xmath0 emission due to photoevaporation off nearby clouds @xcite .",
    "an actual measurement using this last technique is in preparation ( r. weymann , private communication ) . @xcite",
    "used metal absorption line ratios in the halo gas of ngc  3067 to model the required photoionizing background , and their lower limit is shown as the upward triangle . note that all these methods assume that the ionizing radiation is metagalactic and not local , despite measuring the field close to an observable object .",
    "conversely , weak ly@xmath0  absorbers are typically far from galaxies @xcite",
    ". additionally , our statistical errors are smaller than those of any of the above measurements , but as we now discuss , our modeling uncertainties dominate .",
    "the fgpa ( eq .  [ eqn : fgpa ] ) indicates that @xmath16 depends on the density of the absorbing gas in addition to @xmath18 .",
    "the exponent of this dependence is approximately 1.6 at high redshift . in the previous section we showed that low redshift absorbers are consistent with this relation , though the spread is significantly greater .",
    "what is less certain is how the density of the absorbing gas varies as one changes @xmath19 , cosmology , and numerical parameters in the simulations .    at high redshift , nearly all the baryons are in the ly@xmath0  forest ,",
    "so the fgpa can be used to directly probe @xmath19 @xcite . at low redshift ,",
    "the fraction of gas giving rise to ly@xmath0  absorbers is significantly smaller ( @xmath115 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because many of the baryons have moved into other phases ( dhkw , * ? ? ?",
    "though modeling uncertainties are large ( as we discuss below ) , the cosmological simulations generally predict that at the present epoch roughly 1/3 of the baryons are in diffuse photoionized gas , 1/3 are in the shock - heated igm , and 1/3 are in virialized systems such as galaxies and clusters ( see d01 and references therein )",
    ". studies of low - z ly@xmath0  absorbers suggest that the diffuse photoionized igm contains a considerable fraction of the baryons @xcite .",
    "the shock - heated igm is more challenging to detect , but detections of at low redshift suggest that the predicted hot gas is indeed present ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though since absorption can occur in photoionized gas and ly@xmath0  lines can originate in hot gas ( see , e.g. ,  4 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there may be some double - counting in estimates of baryon reservoirs traced by various qso absorbers .",
    "exactly how much baryonic matter remains in gas traced by ly@xmath0  absorbers is uncertain .",
    "one estimate may be obtained if we consider that low-@xmath7 absorbers preferentially arise in the so - called  diffuse \" ( i.e. photoionized ) phase of dhkw and d01 , as suggested by figure  4 . in d01 ,",
    "the baryon fraction in this phase varies by as much as a factor of two ( @xmath116% ) among their simulations having various volumes , resolutions , and hydrodynamic algorithms .",
    "furthermore , those simulations all were based on @xmath2cdm universes with similar @xmath19 .",
    "while this world model has gained much support recently @xcite , dhkw s analysis of several different cosmologies also indicates a possible variation of a factor of @xmath117 in the baryon fraction in this phase due to the differing rates of structure formation .",
    "additionally , there is some uncertainty in @xmath19 itself , and uncertainties in @xmath118 come into play as well since the observed quantity is usually the combination @xmath119 . due to these variations , combined with @xmath120 ,",
    "our best estimate for a @xmath51 systematic uncertainty in the determination of @xmath18 is roughly a factor of @xmath121 .",
    "clearly this dominates over the statistical error quoted above .",
    "thus we will claim a preliminary measurement of @xmath122 from the ly@xmath0  forest , at @xmath10 .",
    "this value is shown as the filled circle in figure  7 ; the horizontal error bar indicates the redshift range covered by our stis spectra .",
    "for the spectral shape proposed by fardal et al .",
    "( similar to that of haardt & madau and approximately @xmath123 ) , this translates to @xmath124 at 912 .",
    "our preliminary result would clearly benefit from improved simulations to better quantify the uncertainties involved .",
    "unfortunately , analytic or semi - analytic methods such as that of @xcite are not applicable to this problem , since the physics of the diffuse igm at low-@xmath7 involves a complex dynamical interplay of non - equilibrium structures .",
    "a proper quantification would involve performing a suite of large - scale hydrodynamic simulations exploring the relevant parameters , something that is beyond our current computational capability .",
    "still , despite the large and poorly quantified uncertainties in the value derived here , ours is among the best observational constraints on the metagalactic photoionization rate to date , and offers hope that a more precise determination may be forthcoming soon .",
    "we have examined the intergalactic ly@xmath0  absorber population in stis spectra of pg0953 + 415 and h1821 + 643 , and compared it to that in artificial spectra drawn from a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation of a @xmath2cdm universe . the good spectral resolution ( 7  km / s ) and relatively high",
    "s / n of these stis spectra yield an unprecedented view into the weak absorber population at low redshift .",
    "we find :    * the column density distributions agree quite well in slope and amplitude .",
    "the measured slope is @xmath125 , considerably steeper than that seen at high redshift ( @xmath61 ) , indicating that strong absorption line systems have evolved away faster than weak ones . *",
    "the @xmath3-parameter ( linewidth ) distributions agree quite well , with an intrinsic median @xmath3-parameter of @xmath126  km / s . this value is lower than that seen at high redshift , suggesting that the igm has cooled and/or bulk flow broadening has lessened .",
    "the median @xmath3-parameter increases with @xmath30 , indicating that denser igm gas is hotter . from a comparison of @xmath3-parameters with the expected thermal linewidth ,",
    "thermal broadening has an increased contribution to linewidths at low-@xmath7 , with @xmath104 .",
    "* ly@xmath0  absorbers preferentially arise in gas having temperatures close to that expected from photoionization , with @xmath127 , though there is substantial scatter to higher temperatures due to absorbers arising in the shock - heated igm . *",
    "the density - column density relation , a.k.a .",
    "the fluctuating gunn - peterson approximation , is considerably less tight at low redshift than at high-@xmath7 .",
    "a trend still exists , consistent with that seen at high redshift , but shows greater scatter . * the minimum @xmath3-parameter as a function of column density faithfully yields the temperature - density relation in the igm .",
    "the simulation analyzed here suggests @xmath128  k , with an upper limit of @xmath9  k , for ly@xmath0  absorbing gas at the cosmic mean density . *",
    "the amplitude of the column density distribution may be used to place constraints on @xmath18 , the metagalactic photoionization rate at low-@xmath7 .",
    "we find , at @xmath129 , @xmath130 , with systematic uncertainties in modeling being the dominant source of error .    in summary ,",
    "weak ly@xmath0  absorbers in the low - redshift igm seen with stis appear to be physically similar to high redshift ly@xmath0  absorbers , arising in non - equilibrium large - scale structures that are highly photoionized by the metagalactic uv flux , as suggested by dhkw .",
    "uncertainties from our current simulation limit our ability to extract all possible quantitative information contained even in this small sample of stis spectra , so improved simulations will be required to confirm the results presented here .",
    "still , these preliminary results indicate that we are close to understanding the low redshift ly@xmath0  forest at a level similar to what has been achieved at high redshift .",
    "this would be a remarkable achievement for studies of the nearby intergalactic medium using ultraviolet spectroscopy , and analogous to what has transpired recently with high-@xmath7 forest studies , promises to open up a new realm for observational tests of theories of cosmology , structure formation , and the evolution of intergalactic baryons .",
