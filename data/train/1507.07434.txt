    "teleparallelism @xcite is an equivalent approach of general relativity with deep implications which can not be provided by the standard metric formulation of gravity .",
    "for example , it provides a correct definition for the local energy - momentum tensor of the gravitational field which can not be expressed in terms of the metric .",
    "this formulation is based on the use of the vierbein , along with a connection of vanishing curvature , as basic objects , not aiming to define another gravitational theory , but to describe anew einstein s gravity itself .",
    "torsion turns out to be the appropriate quantity for this reformulation .",
    "the einstein - hilbert lagrangian is expressed ( up to boundary quantities ) in terms of torsion , so that only up to first order derivatives in the dynamical quantities ( vierbein / connection ) appear in the new lagrangian .",
    "this lagrangian is a particular quadratic combination of torsion which is called torsion scalar @xmath0 . as a result ,",
    "the einstein equations have also their torsion analogue . as the metric formulation ,",
    "also the teleparallel one is both diffeomorphism and local lorentz invariant . by employing the weitzenbck connection as solution of the connection equation of motion ( vanishing curvature , but non - vanishing antisymmetric piece of the connection when expressed in coordinates , and hence non - vanishing torsion ) ,",
    "the vierbein remains as the single dynamical variable and only the lagrangian lacks local lorentz invariance .",
    "notice that in practice the teleparallelism condition of vanishing curvature is implemented through the weitzenbck connection , and therefore the teleparallel approach is different than other approaches ( e.g. @xcite ) where torsion introduces a new dynamical field beyond the fields ( metric , vierbein ) describing the einstein sector . not only einstein gravity but",
    "also gauss - bonnet gravity has been shown to possess its teleparallel representation through another torsion scalar @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "modifications of einstein or gauss - bonnet gravity , different than the curvature based modifications @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath3 @xcite have been constructed based on @xmath0 , @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 @xcite theories have been investigated which in the covariant formulation are also diffeomorphism and local lorentz invariant .    beyond the purely gravitational sector , there are in nature various sorts of matter fields .",
    "scalar fields for example are predicted by fundamental theories and may be present in the universe at large scales mixed up with baryonic matter , and so be present in ordinary stars .",
    "spherically symmetric configurations for self - gravitating scalar fields with various types of interactions have been derived as solutions of the coupled einstein - scalar system @xcite . at cosmological scales",
    "the scalar field dynamics allows to investigate the features of the early universe , or a quintessence scalar field can be interpreted as the present dynamical dark energy sector @xcite .",
    "the appearance of a non - minimal coupling of the form @xmath6 is motivated by many reasons , such as the variability of the fundamental constants , the kaluza - klein compactification scheme , the low - energy limit of superstring theory , e.tc .",
    "a non - minimal derivative coupling between matter and gravity is the next step of generalization , particularly if the newton s constant depends on the gravitational field source mass @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "a first step was made in an attempt to probe the effect of torsion to general relativity when this is treated in its teleparallel reformulation , so the torsion scalar @xmath0 was coupled to a scalar field @xmath7 in four spacetime dimensions . since for a diagonal vierbein , a simpler coupling of the form @xmath8 does not possess spherically symmetric solutions ( however for three dimensions see @xcite ) , a non - minimal derivative coupling of the form @xmath9 was considered .",
    "this is a novel coupling which provides only second order equations of motion .",
    "the metric - based analogous coupling of the form @xmath10 gives higher order equations of motion @xcite , while the sector @xmath11 of the general horndeski lagrangian also is a healthy theory with second order field equations @xcite .",
    "of course , the above derivative coupling between torsion and matter is not the only one that can be constructed , but other combinations of @xmath12 with quadratic ( of even higher ) powers of torsion could be presented . in @xcite",
    "static spherically symmetric solutions were studied for the above coupling with torsion , however after the formulation was developed , only a general class of large - distance linearized solutions around its asymptotic anti - de sitter ( ads ) form was found . here",
    ", we will extend the analysis and find other ( general and special ) large - distance solutions in the non - linearized regime however , which turn out to be black hole solutions of the theory .",
    "the approximated solutions found have the meaning that they become of higher and higher accuracy as we restrict in particular regions of the parameter / integration constants space , which is not however fine - tuned or particularly narrow .",
    "the regime of applicability of these solutions is for any distance larger than some length scale determined by these parameters .",
    "a general such black hole solution turns out to have asymptotics which deviate from the ads form and are of the hypescaling violating lifshitz form .",
    "our work is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the basic elements and equations of the model appeared in @xcite are briefly presented so that to make the present work autonomous . in section iii",
    "we proceed with the essential steps in order to simplify the master equation of the problem and facilitate our quest for finding large - distance non - perturbative spherically symmetric solutions of the theory . in section",
    "iv we consider a special solution ( i.e. for a particular value of the integration constant of the scalar field ) and find black holes and other solutions along with the scalar field profile and the potential . in section v a dynamical systems analysis reveals the global phase portrait of all the local solutions and serves to obtain an intuition for the approximations made in order to obtain the solutions of the next section .",
    "in section vi a general from the viewpoint of the number of integration constants black hole solution is found , its asymptotic behavior is analyzed and some astrophysical perspective of the solution is elaborated .",
    "finally , section vii is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "we will consider the following non - minimal derivative coupling of a scalar field @xmath7 with torsion @xcite @xmath13\\ , , \\label{tnonminimal}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the potential of the scalar field and the parameter @xmath15 has dimensions of length square , so @xmath16 introduces a new length scale .",
    "the torsion scalar @xmath0 is defined by @xmath17 where the tensor @xmath18 is @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the contortion tensor .",
    "the connection @xmath21 is assumed to satisfy the teleparallelism condition of vanishing curvature @xmath22 ( indices @xmath23 refer to tangent space , while @xmath24 are coordinate ones ) . in terms of an arbitrary orthonormal vierbein @xmath25 ( with dual @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) , i.e. @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the minkowski metric , the torsion is defined by @xmath30 and is a tensor under local lorentz transformations and under diffeomorphisms .",
    "the metric is assumed to be compatible with the connection @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath32 , and so @xmath33 , where @xmath34 denotes covariant differentiation with respect to @xmath31 .",
    "the importance of the torsion scalar @xmath0 is that it provides after variation with respect to @xmath35 the einstein equations , i.e. @xmath36 equals @xmath37 up to a total divergence , where @xmath38 is the ricci scalar of the christoffel connection @xmath39 .",
    "a curvature - based analogue of the above non - minimal coupling is the term @xmath10 .",
    "the basic difference between these two is that while the curvature coupling provides higher than second derivatives ( and therefore ghosts ) , here , the torsion coupling gives only second order equations of motion . in some sense , the coupling in ( [ tnonminimal ] )",
    "can be said that it is closer to the curvature coupling @xmath11 which also provides second order equations of motion , and indeed at the level only of background cosmology these two couplings coincide .",

    ", we adopt the weitzenbck solution of the equations of motion @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath45 in the frame @xmath35 we will work with , therefore , @xmath46 in all coordinate frames .",
    "we are interested in extracting static spherically symmetric solutions of the four - dimensional scalar - torsion gravity described by the action ( [ tnonminimal ] ) . due to the spherical symmetry ,",
    "the general form of the metric is diagonal @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the two - dimensional sphere , and @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are three unknown functions .",
    "one could have chosen the gauge with @xmath52 , but it turns out to be more convenient to let the function @xmath51 free . as a next step in order to extract a vierbein that gives rise to the above metric , we choose the simplest diagonal vierbein of the form @xmath53 substitution of ( [ vierb1 ] ) in the field equations ( [ equationeomega1 ] ) , ( [ equationphi ] ) provides the following set of equations of motion @xmath54&\\!\\!=\\!\\!&0\\label{2}\\\\ \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\ !",

    "an interesting characteristic , usual in teleparallel gravity , is the appearance of the off - diagonal equation ( [ 4 ] ) , although the metric ansatz ( [ sphermetric ] ) and the vielbein ( [ vierb1 ] ) are diagonal .",
    "this does not happen in the equations of motion derived from curvature - based actions , and in general , the extra equation imposes difficulties in finding solutions in the torsion formulation . equations ( [ 1])-([eqmsc ] ) have the reparametrizion invariance , so for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , the equations remain form invariant .",
    "this implies that one of these equations is not necessary because it arises from the others .",
    "thus , we remain with four independent equations for four unknowns @xmath62 ( @xmath51 is not considered in the enumeration of the unknowns due to the choice of the radial gauge ) , so there is no arbitrary function left . as a result",
    "the previous system has basically a unique solution and this gives us a hope to extract some information on the structure and behaviour of the derived solutions not constrained by a prefixed potential .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that if @xmath63 where a dot denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath7 , the system of equations ( [ 1])-([eqmsc ] ) reduces to the master equation for @xmath64 @xmath65 where @xmath66 the integration constant @xmath67 with dimensions of inverse length square is introduced through the relation @xmath68 arising from ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "after equation ( [ jsi ] ) is solved , the potential , the scalar field profile and the metric can be found .",
    "namely , the potential @xmath69 is found from @xmath70 and the scalar field @xmath71 is obtained from @xmath72 the lapse function @xmath73 is found from @xmath74^{2}=\\frac{z(x)}{y(x)}\\ , , \\label{dlnrn21}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 finally the metric takes the form @xmath76 note that as far as @xmath15 and @xmath67 remain unrelated , the coupling @xmath15 appears only through the combination @xmath77 and this is due to the initial interaction term @xmath78 .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate the behavior of another physically meaningful quantity which is the energy - momentum tensor @xmath79 of the scalar field @xmath7 .",
    "this arises by variation with respect to @xmath35 of the scalar field action , i.e. of the second integral appearing in ( [ tnonminimal ] )",
    ". one can find from ( [ 1])-([4 ] ) the on - shell components of @xmath80 as @xmath81 , @xmath82 , which express the energy density and the pressures of the scalar field .",
    "since @xmath83 , it arises @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "we start by writing equation ( [ jsi ] ) as @xmath86 which also takes the form @xmath87 if we define @xmath88 equation ( [ kfi ] ) takes the form @xmath89 which is simpler than the initial equation ( [ jsi ] ) .    equation ( [ dhj ] ) for @xmath90 becomes autonomous @xmath91 if @xmath92 equation ( [ ujf ] ) becomes @xmath93 it is convenient to define @xmath94 , @xmath95 . the parameters @xmath96 are not independent ,",
    "but they obey the relations @xmath97 , @xmath98 , where @xmath99 .",
    "it is seen that for @xmath100 , the parameter @xmath101 can take any positive value , while for @xmath102 it is @xmath103 .",
    "the inequality ( [ ela ] ) gets the form @xmath104 finally , equation ( [ ujd ] ) becomes @xmath105 equation ( [ ujm ] ) is also written as @xmath106 or also @xmath107 although ( [ wdh ] ) is a first order differential equation , significantly and unexpectedly simpler than the initial equation ( [ jsi ] ) , there is no known method how to solve it .",
    "however , its characteristic form with the presence of the inverse powers of @xmath108 will enable us to find `` large''-distance non - perturbative solutions .",
    "as always , the word large is meant in comparison with scales and integration constants of the problem , and depending on them , the corresponding distances can be relevant for a physical situation .",
    "note that the system of equations ( [ 1])-([eqmsc ] ) for vanishing scalar field @xmath109 and a cosmological constant as the potential @xmath14 has the standard schwarzschild-(a)ds solution .",
    "a vanishing scalar field means that @xmath110 and then it is @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , while @xmath114 of ( [ kfi ] ) , ( [ dhj ] ) become infinite .",
    "moreover , the autonomous equation ( [ ujf ] ) can not recover this limit since the inequality ( [ era ] ) is never satisfied .",
    "the reason is that the exponential factor in ( [ dhj ] ) becomes significant in this limit .",
    "however , although the general solutions to be derived will not be continuous deformation of schwarzschild , this does not necessarily mean that they will not capture some interesting phenomenology , for example they could be related to galactic scales or beyond .",
    "in the limit @xmath115 the theory posseses solutions , including black holes , with non trivial scalar field and potential . for @xmath115 , the scalar field @xmath116 and ( [ dxdphiv ] )",
    "is not defined due to that @xmath117 vanishes .",
    "however , the `` normalized '' field @xmath118 obeys @xmath119 which is a meaningful equation .",
    "similarly , although @xmath120 in ( [ dhj ] ) , however this equation still makes sense .",
    "indeed , if we define the `` normalized '' variable @xmath121 , ( [ dhj ] ) becomes in this limit @xmath122 where there is no free parameter left in ( [ nkb ] ) .",
    "then , ( [ dxdphiv ] ) becomes @xmath123 and equations ( [ dlnrn21 ] ) , ( [ gij ] ) are meaningful .",
    "finally , the metric ( [ jsb ] ) becomes @xmath124 the potential @xmath14 is found from ( [ wij ] ) to be @xmath125 we will find as a warm up large - distance solutions in the above limit .    for @xmath126",
    "we get from ( [ nkb ] ) @xmath127 if @xmath128 , then @xmath129 or equivalently @xmath130 the variables @xmath131 are dimensionless and we can check by numerically solving ( [ wqk ] ) that every solution extends to large values of @xmath132 .",
    "thus , for @xmath133 we get from ( [ wqk ] ) @xmath134 with general solution @xmath135 where @xmath136 is integration constant . then , @xmath137 where @xmath138 is another integration constant .",
    "depending on @xmath139 , this solution can indeed correspond to large values of @xmath140 , since we see that large values of @xmath140 can correspond to large values of @xmath132 . integrating equation ( [ dlnrn21 ] ) we find @xmath141 . finally ,",
    "rescaling the time @xmath142 , there arise two sorts of metrics @xmath143 or @xmath144 thus , there exist four different metrics .    depending on the constants @xmath139 , the metric ( [ qwf ] )",
    "may possess horizon . to be concrete ,",
    "let us consider the first case of ( [ elc ] ) with @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "then , it is obvious that large values of @xmath140 correspond to @xmath147 ( or @xmath148 ) , which means @xmath149 . from ( [ vle ] ) it is also @xmath150 , while the quantity @xmath151 is large even for @xmath152 . on the other hand , the horizon of ( [ qwf ] ) corresponds to @xmath153 , which means @xmath154 .",
    "this value can be made arbitrarily larger than @xmath155 by choosing @xmath156 sufficiently small , and so the existence of the horizon within our approximation has been shown . in this case ,",
    "( [ qwf ] ) with the first of ( [ elc ] ) is the black hole @xmath157 and the solution is certainly valid outside the horizon .",
    "asymptotically , it gets an ads form @xmath158 the length scale introduced here is @xmath159 and the corresponding effective cosmological constant @xmath160 .",
    "similarly , for the second case of ( [ elc ] ) with @xmath161 and @xmath146 , it is obvious that large values of @xmath140 correspond to @xmath147 ( or @xmath148 ) , which means @xmath162 . from ( [ vle ] )",
    "it is also @xmath150 , while the quantity @xmath151 is large even for @xmath152 . on the other hand",
    ", the horizon of ( [ qwf ] ) corresponds to @xmath153 , which means @xmath163 .",
    "this value again can be made arbitrarily larger than @xmath164 for @xmath156 sufficiently small , and so in this case ( [ qwf ] ) with the second of ( [ elc ] ) forms another black hole @xmath165 asymptotically , it also gets another ads form @xmath166 with @xmath167 .",
    "concerning the scalar field @xmath168 , we find from ( [ rll ] ) for the two black hole solutions ( [ eef ] ) , ( [ eof ] ) respectively @xmath169 notice that the scalar field diverges at the position of the horizon and also asymptotically .",
    "the scalar field is a secondary hair since it does not introduce a new non - trivial integration constant ( i.e. @xmath7 is not varied independently of the black hole parameters ) .",
    "finally from ( [ ery ] ) , since @xmath170 , we find the potential @xmath14 respectively @xmath171 where @xmath172 is a @xmath173 sign . from ( [ elv ] ) , converting @xmath140 to @xmath168 , we can easily find @xmath174 respectively @xmath175\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , \\text{or}\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , f^{-2}=4\\tau^{2}\\big [ e^{\\mp\\tau(\\tilde{\\phi}-\\tilde{\\phi}_{0})}\\!-\\ ! \\sigma e^{\\mp 2\\tau(\\tilde{\\phi}-\\tilde{\\phi}_{0})}\\big ] .",
    "\\label{qjs}\\ ] ] substituting ( [ qjs ] ) into ( [ cdf ] ) we find @xmath176 .",
    "note that for any solution with specific @xmath139 the corresponding potential @xmath14 that supports the solution also depends on @xmath139 .",
    "we could rescale @xmath168 to @xmath177 or @xmath178 , but still @xmath139 remain in @xmath14 . at spatial infinity it is @xmath179 ,",
    "therefore the potential becomes for the two cases @xmath180 or @xmath181 , and for @xmath182 these values coincide with the corresponding values of @xmath183 . for @xmath184 ,",
    "these values of @xmath14 are positive , therefore the cosmological constant coming from the potential in the action is positive , while the effective cosmological constant @xmath185 of asymptotically ads space is negative .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the growth of a non trivial profile of the scalar field which is coupled to the torsion and modifies the asymptotic form of the spacetime . in @xcite a similar discrepancy between @xmath185 and @xmath14 has been found , but not for positive @xmath14 which is the case here .",
    "a positive value of @xmath14 has the merit that it can be related to the vacuum energy of spacetime . on the other hand , in @xcite and other solutions",
    "the asymptotic value of @xmath14 is the same as @xmath183 .",
    "note also that at the horizon the potential @xmath14 is finite . concerning the components of the energy - momentum tensor we have @xmath186 .",
    "therefore , although the scalar field diverges at the horizon , its energy density and the pressures are finite there .",
    "asymptotically , still the energy density of the scalar field and the pressures remain finite .",
    "finally , notice that due to the higher order pole at the horizon , the temperature vanishes in analogy to the reissner - nordstrom solution .     for @xmath187 ,",
    "the second order autonomous differential equation ( [ ujf ] ) can be converted into a two - dimensional dynamical system with one function the variable @xmath189 and as second function some combination containing the derivative @xmath190 , e.g @xmath191 . to study the system it is better to convert into dimensionless variables .",
    "we define @xmath192 where @xmath193 and @xmath194 is real .",
    "so , instead of the equation ( [ ujf ] ) we have the following equivalent system @xmath195 where @xmath196 .",
    "we can find the fixed points of this system by setting @xmath197 .",
    "then , we find these fixed points to be @xmath198 for @xmath199 , @xmath103 there is exactly one fixed point ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "there are two negative eigenvalues @xmath201 of the linearized system , thus the fixed point is attractor ( stable node ) , as also seen in fig .",
    "1 . in fig . 1 , 2 , 3 the horizontal axis is @xmath202 and the vertical @xmath194 , and the arrows show increasement of the radius @xmath140 .",
    "moreover , due to the pole @xmath203 in ( [ dgh ] ) , the phase portraits are separated into two quadrants , the upper one with @xmath204 and the lower with @xmath205 . for @xmath206 , @xmath207",
    "there is again exactly one fixed point ( @xmath208 ) . in this case , the two eigenvalues @xmath209 have opposite signs , therefore the fixed point is saddle , as also seen in fig .",
    "2 . finally , for @xmath210 , @xmath211 there is no fixed point , as it is seen in fig .",
    "the values ( [ hek ] ) of @xmath202 are the same found in @xcite studying the asymptotic behaviour of equation ( [ jsi ] ) . from the above analysis it becomes clear that only for @xmath199 ( case a of @xcite ) the fixed point is attractor and indeed corresponds to a large - distance asymptotic solution . for @xmath212 ( case b of @xcite )",
    "the fixed point is saddle and does not correspond to an asymptotic solution",
    ". it would be interesting for @xmath199 to investigate beyond the linearized asymptotic behavior found in @xcite , also the non - perturbative regime of the solution , however , this will not be studied in the present paper . in the present paper",
    "we will find the large - distance non - perturbative solutions which correspond to large values of @xmath213 as shown in the upper quadrants of fig . 1 and 2 .",
    "these solutions will be now shown that are attracted by stable fixed points at infinity .     for @xmath214 , @xmath215     for @xmath216 , @xmath217    due to that the dynamical system ( [ qfh ] ) , ( [ dgh ] ) is non - compact , there could be non - trivial fixed points at infinity , i.e. at the asymptotic region of the phase portrait @xmath218 .",

    "the critical points @xmath232 at infinity are obtained by setting @xmath233 in ( [ fqwf ] ) and solving for @xmath234 , thus @xmath235 this equation has for any @xmath236 two roots for @xmath232 , one positive and one negative",
    ". therefore , there are always two fixed points at infinity , one in the upper quadrant of the @xmath237 plane and the other in the lower quadrant , as are also depicted in the uncompactified plots of fig . 1 , 2 , 3 . since @xmath238",
    "we can not rely on the linearized analysis to examine the stability of these fixed points and numerical examination is needed .",
    "indeed , it can be seen numerically that for the parameters of fig . 1 , 2 a stable fixed point exists for @xmath239 ( for which it is @xmath240 ) and an unstable fixed point exists for @xmath241 ( for which it is @xmath242 ) , in agreement with the phase portraits of fig . 1 , 2",
