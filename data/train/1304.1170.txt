    "wide - field photometric surveys have enabled the identification of at least 15 stellar debris streams in the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "roughly the same number of cold substructures have been found in velocity space @xcite .",
    "in addition to helping us reconstruct the accretion history of the galaxy , they can also serve as sensitive probes of the galactic potential @xcite .",
    "globular cluster streams are particularly interesting in this regard as they are the coldest stellar substructures yet discovered @xcite .",
    "a large sample of such streams will ultimately enable us to map the distribution of galactic dark matter with much greater spatial resolution than has been possible to date .",
    "detailed analyses of these streams may also enable us to better characterize the dark matter sub - halos believed to populate the galactic halo . @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine the 2mass point source catalog @xcite and the wide field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) all - sky release @xcite for evidence of nearby streams in regions of the sky as yet unexplored in other surveys .",
    "we briefly describe our analysis in section [ analysis ] .",
    "we characterize the stream in section [ discussion ] and we discuss evidence that the stream may be associated with the globular cluster ngc 288 in section [ ngc288 ] .",
    "we make concluding remarks section [ conclusion ] .",
    "data comprising wise bands w1 ( 3.4 ) and w2 ( 4.6 ) , along with matching 2mass j ( 1.25 ) photometry , were extracted from the wise all - sky release and analyzed using the matched filter technique described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "matched - filtering has been used to detect halo streams to very low surface densities in sloan digital sky survey data @xcite . while 2mass data have been used to map the sagittarius stream using m giants @xcite , both wise and 2mass data are more limited in this application for main sequence stars due to their much fainter magnitudes .",
    "sdss experience has shown that matched - filter techniques over large areas work well only if the main sequence turnoff of a population is detectable . moreover , while wise goes somewhat deeper than 2mass j , the w1-w2 colors of stars are very nearly degenerate compared with the photometric uncertainties . combining wise bands w1 and w2 with",
    "2mass j improves the situation , providing both color discrimination and greater depth than is possible with 2mass photometry alone . with a limiting magnitude of j @xmath2 ,",
    "the wise and 2mass data can probe main sequence populations out to a distance of @xmath3 kpc .",
    "an additional issue with the wise all - sky data are the presence of significant , magnitude - dependent , photometric biases at faint magnitudes resulting from an overestimate of background levels .",
    "since these biases can exceed 30% at the faintest magnitudes , this has serious consequences for filtering of sources based on color .",
    "aperture magnitudes are less affected by this bias but they are much noisier due to aperture contamination .",
    "we consequently measured this bias in w1 and w2 by comparing profile - fitting measurements with aperture photometry using several million well - fit , isolated stars in the region @xmath4 r.a .",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath6 dec @xmath7 .",
    "we generated a look - up table of photometric bias versus magnitude at half - magnitude intervals and interpolated this table to compute appropriate corrections for profile - fitted photometry .",
    "we constructed matched filters based on the padova database of theoretical stellar isochrones @xcite . all stars with @xmath8",
    "were used , and we dereddened both wise and 2mass photometry as a function of position on the sky using the dirbe / iras dust maps of @xcite , corrected using the prescription of @xcite .",
    "we use only stars with cc flags of 0 , photometric quality flags of `` a '' , `` b '' , or `` c '' , @xmath9 , and the ext flag = 0 , to select on uncontaminated , unresolved objects with snr @xmath10 . for the present search",
    ", the color - magnitude distribution of field stars was sampled using @xmath11 stars in a broad region extending from the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) to the south galactic pole .",
    "the filters were simultaneously applied to the entire wise and 2mass catalogs , and the resulting weights were combined to yield all - sky , filtered surface density maps .",
    "figure 1 shows the filtered star count distribution in the region of the south galactic pole using a filter whose basis is an isochrone with z = 0.0025 , an age of 12 gyrs , and is shifted so as to optimally sample populations at a distance of 1.9 kpc .",
    "this distribution was constructed by combining the weights of stars in 0.2   bins based on their distances from the @xmath12 and @xmath13 main sequence and giant branch color - magnitude loci .",
    "apparent in figure 1 is a long , narrow feature spanning some 24   across the southern sky .",
    "the orientation of the feature does not precisely align with lines of either constant r.a . or dec , or constant ecliptic longitude or latitude , indicating that the feature is not an artifact of sampling or data quality discontinuities in either of the two surveys .",
    "the feature shows no correlation with reddening maps of the area ( where e(b - v ) is typically @xmath14 ) , nor does it correlate with the 2mass j_msnr10 values ] , which estimate the depth of the 2mass survey as a function of sky position .",
    "the feature is also localized in color - magnitude space , which would not be the case if the feature were due simply to variations in completeness .",
    "we conclude that the feature is not an artifact , but a bona fide stellar debris stream .",
    "other curvilinear features are evident at various locations across the sky , but at much lower signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "the visible stream runs through phoenix , eridanus , hydrus , tucana , and becomes lost at its southern end near the smc .",
    "given the rather blue filters we are using and the magnitude limits of the wise and 2mass surveys , we regard it as extremely unlikely that the new stream could be associated with the smc .",
    "moreover , the orientation of the stream is nearly perpendicular to the smc s orbital path @xcite . we designate the new stream alpheus , after the river in the _ illiad . _",
    "the northern end of the stream appears to end fairly abruptly at ( ra , dec ) = ( 27.7 , -45.0 ) . over the interval @xmath15 ,",
    "the path of the stream is well fit in celestial coordinates ( to within 1 ) by a polynomial of the form :    @xmath16    color - magnitude hess diagrams ( cmds ) for alpheus are shown in figure 2 .",
    "these distributions were determined using equation 1 to select stars within @xmath17 of the centerline of the stream .",
    "similar regions , @xmath18 wide on either side of the stream and laterally offset by @xmath19 , were used to sample the field star population . scaling the latter to the former by area , the cmds in figure 2 are subtractions of the two . while not strong , a turn - off and upper main sequence are clearly visible . for j - w1 ,",
    "the sequence is matched reasonably well using a padova isochrone having [ fe / h ] = -1.0 , though the uncertainty is quite large because the isochrones for different metallicities are rather closely spaced at these wavelengths .",
    "the j - w2 cmd is less convincing , suggesting a somewhat bluer sequence .",
    "based on the stronger j - w1 sequence , figure 2 suggests an uncertainty on the order of at least 0.5 dex .",
    "deeper follow - up surveys in visual bands and spectroscopy of individual stars will be required to better constrain the metallicity of the stream .    a number of curvilinear features are evident in figure 1 , and one might ask how alpheus compares in terms of significance .",
    "we can make use of the `` t - statistic '' of @xcite , which measures the median contrast along its length between a putative stream and the surrounding field .",
    "the t - statistic for alpheus , comparing with the field extending the length of the stream and @xmath20 to the north and @xmath21 to the south in ecliptic coordinates , is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the stream is detected at the @xmath22 level , and the lateral full - width - at - half - maximum of the stream is @xmath23 . at a distance of 1.9 kpc ( see below ) this corresponds to a spatial extent of @xmath24 pc .",
    "this is similar to the widths of other streams that are known or believed to have been generated by globular clusters @xcite , suggesting that the progenitor of alpheus was itself a globular cluster .",
    "the next - most convincing overdensity is detected at @xmath25 , and we will consider this and other features in a forthcoming paper .    following @xcite we shift our filter brightward and faintward to estimate the stream s distance . combining results for j - w1 and j - w2 , we find that the signal - to - noise ratio of the northern half of the stream peaks at a distance modulus of @xmath26 mag , while the southern half of the stream peaks at @xmath27 mag .",
    "the uncertainties are quite large due to a combination of the small number of stars , large photometric errors at the faint limit , and the relatively narrow range of stellar colors at these wavelengths .",
    "this would put the northern half of the stream at a mean sun - centric distance of @xmath28 kpc , while the southern half is at @xmath29 kpc .",
    "we note that a simple ratio of filtered stream to background signal peaks at 2.3 kpc in the southern half and 3.9 kpc in the northern half .",
    "however , the stream is not nearly as apparent or continuous using such a filter , nor does such a filter match the cmd in figure 2 .",
    "summing the color - selected , background - subtracted , but otherwise unweighted star counts over a width of @xmath23 we find the number of stars in the stream to w1 @xmath2 to be @xmath30 .",
    "the quoted uncertainty is largely due to the shot noise contributed by the several thousand field stars with similar colors lying along our line of sight to the stream .",
    "the average surface density is @xmath31 stars deg@xmath32 , with peaks of @xmath33 stars deg@xmath32 .",
    "based on its relatively low concentration and fairly eccentric , retrograde orbit , ngc 288 has a relatively high predicted destruction rate @xcite , and both @xcite and @xcite found a significant population of extratidal stars in the vicinity of the cluster .",
    "figure 4 shows projections of three possible orbits of the cluster , integrated using the galactic model of @xcite .",
    "all integrations use a cluster distance of 8.3 kpc and a radial velocity of -47 kms@xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the three different orbits are based on proper motions of @xmath35 mas / yr , @xmath36 mas / yr @xcite ( a ) , @xmath37 mas / yr , @xmath38 mas / yr @xcite ( b ) , and @xmath39 mas / yr , @xmath40 mas / yr @xcite ( c ) .",
    "two of the orbit integrations ( a and b ) lie nearly parallel to the new stream , offset to the east by @xmath41 .",
    "orbit c is also nearly parallel to the stream , but is offset @xmath42 to the west .",
    "tracing around the integrated orbits , the visible portion of the stream begins at @xmath43 kpc from the cluster and ends at @xmath44 kpc . over the 24   extent of the stream ,",
    "the leading arm of orbit a predicts a heliocentric distance ranging from 3.8 kpc at the southern end to 5.1 kpc at the northern end .",
    "similarly , orbit b ranges from 5 kpc to 6.2 kpc , and orbit c ranges from 7.2 kpc to 7.5 kpc .",
    "the near coincidences in the position , orientation , and distance gradient of the stream , particularly with orbit a , suggest a possible association with ngc 288 .    given the retrograde motion of ngc 288 , the stream would constitute the leading arm of the ngc 288 s tidal tails .",
    "we would expect these stars to have dropped inwards towards the galactic center before being carried forward along their new orbits . that the stream lies to the inside of putative orbits a and",
    "b is consistent with this picture .",
    "an offset of 2.5   at a distance of 1.9 kpc corresponds to @xmath45 pc in projection .",
    "though this offset is somewhat larger than the current tidal radius of ngc 288 ( @xmath46 pc , @xcite ) , we expect escaped stars to have residual velocities that will carry them somewhat farther from the cluster .",
    "indeed , @xcite and @xcite found extratidal stars extending to at least 150 pc in the immediate vicinity of ngc 288 .",
    "our metallicity estimate for stars in the stream is also consistent with a measured value of [ fe / h ] = -1.24 ( z @xmath47 ) for ngc 288 @xcite . as noted earlier , while the stream appears strongest using isochrones with z = 0.0025 ( fe / h @xmath48 ) , due to the small number of stars and the narrow range of colors at these wavelengths , the stream is only marginally less apparent ( s / n @xmath49 ) using an isochrone with z = 0.0015 .",
    "2mass and wise colors are not very sensitive to metallicity , and given the additional uncertainty contributed by our substantial corrections to the wise profile - fit photometry , we consider the agreement to be quite good .",
    "if we adopt a proper motion for ngc 288 of @xmath50 mas / yr , @xmath51 mas / yr , we arrive at orbit d in figure 4 .",
    "this value of the proper motion was arrived at by both forcing the orbit to pass through ngc 288 , and to pass 2.5   to the east along the length of alpheus.the heliocentric distance of this orbit in the range @xmath52 is reduced to between 2.3 and 3.1 kpc which , to within the uncertainties , is in agreement with our distance estimate for the stream .",
    "the adopted value of @xmath53 is in good agreement with the measured values , while the value of @xmath54 is @xmath55 from the mean of the three measurements . combining the measurement uncertainties with inaccuracies in our adopted model for the galactic potential , we consider the association of the stream with ngc 288 plausible , if not proved .",
    "validation of our hypothesis will require radial velocity measurements for a significant number of stream stars .    that the stream does not visibly connect with ngc 288 in figure 4",
    "may simply be due to the limiting magnitude of the wise and 2mass surveys . at the northernmost point of the visible stream",
    ", the ngc 288 orbit model predicts that the heliocentric distances rapidly increase to 8.3 kpc at the position of ngc 288 .",
    "as we use our filters to probe beyond 3 - 5 kpc , the turn - off and subgiant branch fall below our limiting magnitude and we are forced to rely wholly on the rgb for our signal . however , the rgb is much more sparsely populated and more highly contaminated by foreground stars than is the turn - off region .",
    "we detect ngc 288 itself only by virtue of the relatively large number of rgb stars in the cluster itself .",
    "it is also possible that the stream has been partially disrupted by a dark matter subhalo or other perturber of significant mass and/or favorable trajectory .",
    "however , examinations of the pal 5 and gd-1 streams @xcite have not identified gaps anywhere near 4 kpc in length .",
    "we consequently consider this an unlikely possibility , but one which will need to be tested with deeper observations .",
    "using the 2mass and wise all - sky catalogs , we identify a new , 24-long , moderately metal - poor stellar debris stream in the southern hemisphere which we designate alpheus . at a distance of @xmath56 kpc ,",
    "the stream is much nearer than other spatially mapped streams that have been found to date .    based on near coincidences in position , orientation , distance , distance gradient , and metallicity",
    ", we suggest that the stream may be the leading tidal arm of the globular cluster ngc 288 .",
    "testing this hypothesis will require both deeper imaging in the visible bands and spectroscopy .",
    "deeper imaging by the skymapper survey @xcite should enable us to reach well down the main sequence to better characterize the stream and extend its path across the sky .",
    "based on existing proper motion measurements for ngc 288 as well as our attempt to estimate an orbit that would connect alpheus with the cluster , we would predict radial velocities in the range @xmath57 km s@xmath34 at the northern end of the stream , and @xmath58 km s@xmath34 at the southern end .",
    "if indeed alpheus is associated with ngc 288 , these measurements will also enable more comprehensive modeling of the orbit of ngc 288 and the shape of the galactic potential towards the south galactic pole .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge several probing questions by an anonymous referee which helped us to improve and clarify the manuscript .",
    "we also thank s. van den bergh for suggesting a new source of stream designations .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the wide - field infrared survey explorer , which is a joint project of the university of california , los angeles , and the jet propulsion laboratory / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration .",
    "it also makes use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation ."
