    "to completely understand the strengths and limitations of statistical physics , it makes sense to try to derive it from physical principles , without relying on ad hoc assumptions .",
    "along these lines , over the past twenty years , ideas from quantum information have led to new insights into the foundations of statistical physics @xcite .",
    "in particular , some progress has been made recently towards understanding how and when thermalization occurs @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that a large class of states of systems with weak intensive interactions ( e.g.  one dimensional systems ) will thermalize . in @xcite thermalization",
    "was shown to occur , also for a large class of states , for systems in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "( we will compare the results of @xcite to ours in more detail in section  [ sec : thermalization ] . )",
    "more recently , the equivalence of the microcanonical and canonical ensemble ( i.e.  a thermal state ) was proved for finite quantum lattice systems , when correlations in the thermal state decay sufficiently quickly @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    here , we prove thermalization results for closed quantum systems in two parts .",
    "first , we build on previous equilibration results ( such as ref .",
    "a requirement for equilibration is that the effective dimension , defined in section  [ sec : equilibration ] , is large . while there are physical arguments for this to be true @xcite and it is also known to be true for most states drawn from the haar measure on large subspaces @xcite , there are no known techniques to decide whether a given initial state will equilibrate under a given hamiltonian . here , we prove that a large effective dimension is guaranteed for local hamiltonian systems if the correlations in the initial state decay sufficiently quickly and the energy variance is sufficiently large .",
    "the latter is known for thermal states with intensive specific heat capacity and may , for large classes of states , be computed straightforwardly . the second part of thermalization is to show that the equilibrium state is locally indistinguishable from a thermal state . we prove that this is the case if the correlations in the corresponding thermal state decay sufficiently quickly and the relative entropy difference between the equilibrium state and the corresponding thermal state is sufficiently small .    as an application",
    ", we answer the following question . given a closed quantum system that is initially in a thermal state , and suppose we locally quench or disturb it somehow , will it re - equilibrate to a thermal state ? understanding the extent to which thermal states are robust against local external noise is important , e.g. , in decohering quantum simulations implemented in optical lattice systems ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , where such noise can be caused by the absorption and re - emission of a photon .",
    "these questions of re - equilibration have a long tradition and return to equilibrium was shown to occur for infinite lattice systems in the seventies @xcite , by making what were effectively transport assumptions :  on an infinite lattice , it is possible for information to leave a region and never return , which is not true for finite systems .",
    "this fundamental difference highlights the importance of finite - size considerations .",
    "we discuss the connection to the results on infinite lattices further in appendix  [ sec : robinson ] .",
    "return to equilibrium has also been shown for finite quantum systems coupled to infinite reservoirs after a coupling has been turned on @xcite , and a rough argument for stability of thermal states was given recently in terms of energy probability distributions in @xcite . here , we prove that a system in a thermal state , after being locally disturbed , re - equilibrates to a thermal state provided correlations decay sufficiently quickly .",
    "in contrast to what is known for infinite lattice systems , our results give finite - size estimates and our methods and assumptions are entirely different . it is important to emphasize that finite - size bounds are crucial for physical applications , particularly those in quantum thermodynamics @xcite , where thermal states are usually considered to be free resources .",
    "addressing to what extent thermalization occurs will also have impact on the nature of protocols for extracting work using small quantum thermal machines .",
    "we consider a @xmath0-dimensional hypercubic lattice with @xmath1 sites . we suppose that each site is associated with a @xmath2-dimensional quantum system , e.g. , a spin . on this finite quantum spin lattice , we let @xmath3 denote the hamiltonian governing the dynamics and assume that it is @xmath4-local , i.e. , that it is of the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 acts only on lattice sites that are no more than @xmath4 sites separated from @xmath7 , i.e. , only on sites @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "we further assume that the @xmath6 are bounded in operator norm and use units with @xmath10 and boltzmann s and planck s constants set to one , so that @xmath11 .",
    "we write @xmath12 for the state at time @xmath13 and denote the time - average state by @xmath14 we let @xmath15 denote the energy variance of a state @xmath16 with the respect to a hamiltonian @xmath3 , @xmath17}-\\mathrm{tr}^2[\\rho h]$ ]",
    ". we will be interested in subsystems , @xmath18 , of the whole lattice and denote the rest of the system by @xmath19  the _ bath _ or _",
    "environment_. we denote their hilbert space dimensions by @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "given a state of the whole system @xmath16 , we write @xmath22 $ ] and @xmath23 $ ] for the reduced states on the subsystem and environment , respectively .    to discuss",
    "whether two states are close we must consider what one can measure in practice .",
    "mostly , we will consider the local distinguishability of two states , @xmath16 and @xmath24 , given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the trace distance . with this ,",
    "our results extend naturally to coarse - grained observables .",
    "an example of such an observable could be the magnetization of spins on a large region or even the whole lattice .",
    "we may write a coarse - grained observable as @xmath27 , where the @xmath28 are non - overlapping subsystems and @xmath29 acts only on subsystem @xmath28 .",
    "for example , one could take the magnetization per spin @xmath30 .",
    "then local indistinguishability also implies that expectation values of such observables are close : assuming @xmath31 we have @xmath32}-{\\mathrm{tr}\\ !",

    "thus , we cover a large variety of physically realistic measurement possibilities for distinguishing between states .    throughout , we will often consider states with exponentially decaying correlations .",
    "this is guaranteed to be the case for , e.g. , thermal states above a critical temperature @xcite and for ground states of gapped @xmath4-local hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "we define exponentially decaying correlations in the following way .",
    "[ exp dec cor ] a state @xmath16 has exponentially decaying correlations if there is a correlation length @xmath34 and a @xmath35 ( both independent of the system size @xmath36 ) , such that , for any two lattice regions @xmath37 and @xmath38 , one has @xmath39\\subset x\\\\ \\text{supp}[q]\\subset y\\\\ \\|p\\|,\\|q\\|=1}}{\\left| \\frac{{\\mathrm{tr}\\ ! \\left[\\rho p q\\right]}- { \\mathrm{tr}\\ ! \\left[\\rho p\\right]}{\\mathrm{tr}\\ ! \\left[\\rho q\\right]}}{|x||y| } \\right|}\\leq ke^{-\\mathrm{dist}(x , y)/\\xi}.\\ ] ]    here , the distance between the two regions @xmath37 and @xmath38 is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is some metric on the lattice .",
    "due to recurrences , a closed finite system will never truly equilibrate , not even locally .",
    "hence , for finite systems one asks a slightly different question instead @xcite : does a system spend most of its time close to some fixed state ?",
    "if we denote the fixed state by @xmath24 , this means that @xmath42 is small , i.e. , for the majority of times , @xmath43 and @xmath24 are locally indistinguishable .",
    "the most natural example to look at is equilibration to the time - average state . for this case , it was proved in @xcite that @xmath44 where we recall that @xmath45 denotes the hilbert space dimension of the subsystem @xmath18 . here , @xmath46 is the degeneracy of the most degenerate _ energy gap _ , one defines @xmath47 . ]",
    "i.e. , @xmath48 if the hamiltonian has no degenerate energy gaps",
    ". typically , one expects @xmath46 to be small .",
    "in fact , even the existence of degenerate energy gaps is a measure zero constraint on the hamiltonian . also appearing in equation ( [ eq : lpsw ] ) is @xmath49 , known as the effective dimension , which is defined by @xmath50,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the energy projector corresponding to the energy @xmath52 . if the spectrum of @xmath3 is non - degenerate , then the above is equal to @xmath53}$ ] , i.e. , the purity of the equilibrium state .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : lpsw ] ) implies that equilibration occurs when @xmath49 is large .",
    "the fraction of times during which @xmath54 is at most @xmath55 , which follows from markov s inequality .",
    "this result is quite powerful :  it holds for any decomposition of the total system into a subsystem @xmath18 and bath @xmath19 .",
    "this division need not correspond to a spatially localized subsystem .",
    "for example , one could apply the result to multi - point correlation functions over arbitrary distances .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was argued on physical grounds that we should expect @xmath49 to be exponentially large in the system size .",
    "the argument relied on the exponentially increasing density of energy levels for generic physical systems .",
    "furthermore , in ref .  @xcite it was shown that most states drawn at random from a large subspace via the haar measure would typically have large effective dimension .",
    "however , it is not clear that one can take these arguments for granted in all situations of physical interest :  e.g. , in the setting of a local ( or global ) quench or measurement . and there are plenty of physical models for which it is known that the initial state will not have an effective dimension that is exponentially large in the system size .",
    "for example , take any system with a quadratic fermion hamiltonian ( e.g.  the xy model ) . if the number of excitations @xmath56 is fixed and there are @xmath36 modes in total , then the relevant hilbert subspace has dimension @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , the effective dimension is at most polynomial in @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , just calculating the effective dimension for a particular system means computing the overlaps of the state with energy eigenvectors , which is as hard as diagonalizing the hamiltonian in general .",
    "so there is a need for concrete lower bounds on the effective dimension . here",
    ", we prove such a bound , which holds for @xmath4-local hamiltonians and states with exponentially decaying correlations .",
    "[ lem:4 ] * lower bound on the effective dimension : *  suppose the initial state @xmath16 @xmath58or its time average @xmath59 has exponentially decaying correlations as in def .",
    "[ exp dec cor ] .",
    "let the whole system evolve according to a bounded @xmath4-local hamiltonian , and let @xmath16 have energy variance @xmath15 with respect to this hamiltonian .",
    "then there is a constant @xmath60 independent of @xmath36 such that @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "this is proved in appendix  [ app : berry - esseen ] and uses a berry - esseen theorem for quantum lattice systems @xcite . by the assumption on the decay of two - point correlations ,",
    "@xmath63 is upper bounded independent of @xmath36 .",
    "often , it is also lower bounded , e.g. , for thermal states with intensive specific heat capacity @xmath64 , which is given at inverse temperature @xmath65 by @xmath66 .",
    "furthermore , for large classes of states ( e.g. , product states or matrix product states ) it is straightforward to compute @xmath15 such that the question of whether a system equilibrates may be answered directly , without knowledge of the overlap of the initial state with the energy eigenstates .",
    "the requirement that @xmath67 needs to be sufficiently large is reasonable : if the initial state is not sufficiently spread over many eigenstates one can not expect equilibration .",
    "an interesting application of lemma  [ lem:4 ] and eq .",
    "( [ eq : lpsw ] ) together is to a quench scenario .",
    "if the initial state is a ground state of some hamiltonian with exponentially decaying correlations ( e.g. , the ground state of a gapped @xmath4-local hamiltonian ) , then after quenching to any other local hamiltonian , equilibration will occur provided the energy variance @xmath15 ( with respect to the post - quench hamiltonian ) is sufficiently large .    finally , it is important to mention that a full understanding of how long it takes for a quantum system to equilibrate is still lacking .",
    "rigorous estimates of the timescale in a general setting lead to extremely large upper bounds for the timescale @xcite ( often these bounds also involve @xmath68 such that our results are applicable ) . for some quadratic models ,",
    "the timescale is known to be much shorter @xcite .",
    "interesting results also exist showing fast timescales for equilibration in the setting of random hamiltonians , states or measurements @xcite . on the other hand , examples have been constructed of reasonable translationally invariant models with extremely long equilibration timescales @xcite .",
    "in the previous section , we discussed the fact that equilibration occurs with great generality to the time - average state @xmath69 .",
    "but that is only part of thermalization .",
    "the second part is to see whether the time - average state is close to a thermal state .",
    "we thus need a practical way to decide whether , locally , @xmath69 is close to a thermal state .",
    "the following lemma ( see appendix  [ app : therm ] for a more quantitative version ) , recently obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , achieves this by relating the local trace - norm distance of two states to their difference in relative entropy .",

    ", the two states are locally close ( on average over all cubic subsystems of size @xmath77 ) .",
    "also , maybe surprisingly , the size of the subsystem need not be fixed but may also increase as a power law in @xmath36 .",

    "we do so by combining eq .   with lemma  [ lem:4 ] and [ lem : bc main text ] : let the initial state @xmath16 ( or @xmath69 ) have exponentially decaying correlations , evolve according to a bounded @xmath4-local hamiltonian @xmath3 , and have energy variance @xmath15 .",

    "this is true , e.g. , when the hamiltonian is translationally invariant and has no degenerate energies . without requiring translational invariance or making some other transport assumption , we can not guarantee that every subsystem thermalizes .",
    "this is reasonable :  we could consider models where small subsystems retain some memory of their initial state .",
    "in fact , we could replace the requirement that @xmath69 be translationally invariant by the requirement that there is transport in the following sense .",

    "instead we assume that the thermal state has exponentially decaying correlations .",
    "this is always satisfied for @xmath97 @xcite and , for @xmath98 , if the temperature is above a certain critical temperature @xcite .",
