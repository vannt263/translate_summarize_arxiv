    "gillespie s stochastic simulation algorithm has recently gained popularly as a method for simulating the evolution of biochemical systems .",
    "its advantage lies in its ability to capture the inherent stochasticity present in a chemical reaction system , and provide a full statistical description of the evolution of the system  a point not addressed by traditional mass action theory , which , through a mathematical model of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , is able to capture only ensemble averaged behaviour and assumes a continuum of reactant concentrations .",
    "despite the fact that the deterministic mass action theory and the stochastic model of gillespie s algorithm are equivalent in the limit of large system sizes ( both assuming the well - mixed assumption ) , it is widely accepted that the stochastic model is more appropriate for biochemical applications , for the reason that biochemical systems commonly involve very low numbers of reactant molecules .",
    "however , recent studies in the phenomenon of dynamic disorder of biomolecules reveal further stochasticity in certain biochemical systems that has yet to be accounted for by either of the two models : biochemical systems with randomly fluctuating rate constants .",
    "dynamic disorder refers to the fluctuation of the conformational state of a biomolecule , which may be attributed to the minimization of energy landscapes @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations are also associated with causing the fluctuation of the reaction rate constant of the biomolecule due to its changed conformational states @xcite .",
    "the effects of fluctuations due to dynamic disorder has been actively investigated by experimentalists @xcite , whilst models to describe this phenomenon , both on the molecular level and on the macroscopic kinetics level , have also been studied @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that a subdiffusion of the conformational fluctuations based on fractional brownian motion model was proposed by @xcite , in which a key assertion was the molecule s long - range memory of its conformational fluctuations resulting in fluctuations on a broad range of time scales . in all the findings",
    ", it is widely realized that the effects of dynamic disorder on the reaction kinetics of biochemical reaction systems differ from the behaviour of systems where dynamic disorder is absent , and are not detectable by ensemble experiments or models .",
    "one case in point is shown in @xcite , where experiments on the @xmath0-galactosidase enzyme reaction have uncovered interesting statistical properties  heavy - tailed behaviour and correlation in the product formation rates  which are not predicted by models with non - random rate constants .",
    "in particular , careful statistical analysis in @xcite lead the authors to propose that the rate constants in this enzyme reaction system take on a continuum of values and has a stationary gamma distribution .    in light of the findings in the single enzyme reaction ,",
    "the purpose of this paper is to propose a modification of gillespie s algorithm to allow for random rate constants to be incorporated into the simulation .",
    "whilst we retain the idea of the original algorithm , which is to simulate a sample trajectory for the time evolution of the system by simulating the successive occurrences of every reaction in the system , we extend the underlying stochastic model to account for both the simulation of the waiting time between reactions , as well as the simulation of the time evolution of the fluctuating rate constant . in essence , the stochastic model for the evolution of the chemical system is a joint distribution @xmath1 that models the interdependency between the waiting time @xmath2 and the changing rate constant @xmath3 .",
    "the joint distribution is a matter of modelling , thus would of course depend on the physical properties of the reactant molecules .",
    "however , what we propose here is a general framework that forms a starting point for how one might go about the modification of the gillespie s algorithm .",
    "subsequently , we specialize the general framework to the single enzyme example investigated in @xcite , and illustrate a successful way to incorporate physical constraints on the slowly interconverting conformers into model for the joint distribution .",
    "it is here that the basic idea of markov chain monte carlo is applied as a model to enforce the physical constraints , and numerical simulations from the algorithm thus derived are in good concert with the experimental results .    before proceeding ,",
    "we note how this paper differs from other works relating to the gillespie s algorithm",
    ". one major limitation of the algorithm is its slowness , thus one broad area of research focuses on speeding up the algorithm .",
    "examples of these methods include the @xmath2-leaping method @xcite , used to simulate more than one reaction at once , and the quasi - ssa and multiscale techniques , used for simulating stiff systems that possess reactions that occur on multiple time scales @xcite .",
    "simulations can also fully or partially employ the use of the equivalent chemical master equation @xcite .",
    "such speed - ups are not intended to change the fundamental stochastic properties of the chemical system , but typically to merely make approximations to the stochastic model or its chemical master equation to achieve better computational efficiency .",
    "other works have studied more fundamental modifications of the system model , such as fluctuating rate constants of white noise type @xcite , or biochemical systems possessing rate constants that vary with time as a result of external factors such as cell growth or temperature changes @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , no works have addressed the general issue of randomly fluctuating rate constants , particularly the kind exhibited in the presence of dynamic disorder where the rate constants vary over a wide range of time scales comparable to or slower than the time scale of the reactions .",
    "finally , we remark that there seems to be no easy way to reduce the problem of dynamic disorder into the original framework of gillespie s algorithm ; even if the conformational changes were to be represented as a finite number of basic reactions in the chemical system , such a reduction is inadequate for reproducing the full dynamics of a system that actually has a continuous range of conformational states and rate constants ( see @xcite and its accompanying supplementary material ) .",
    "before launching into the modifications of the gillespie algorithm , we briefly review the ideas in the original algorithm .",
    "the gillespie algorithm is derived from a probabilistic model of chemical reactions at the level of molecular interactions . given a system of chemical reactions @xmath4 , indexed by @xmath5 , of the form",
    "@xmath6 we associate with each reaction @xmath4 a constant @xmath7 with the property that + @xmath8 the constant @xmath7 takes the interpretation in the ssa as the rate constant of the chemical reaction . denote by @xmath9 the stoichiometric coefficient representing the total number of possible combinations of @xmath4 reactant molecules available .",
    "the _ propensity _ @xmath10 describes the rate for reaction @xmath4 to occur , in the sense that @xmath11 is the probability that reaction @xmath4 will occur in the next infinitesimal time interval @xmath12 .",
    "it is then shown that the waiting time @xmath2 for the next reaction in the system to occur is exponentially distributed with rate @xmath13 and density @xmath14 additionally , @xmath15 is the probability that the reaction that occurred is @xmath4 .",
    "the ssa produces a sample trajectory starting from an initialized the reactant state space at time @xmath16 , followed by iterative simulation of subsequent reaction steps .",
    "each reaction step is simulated by generating a random number @xmath2 from the density and a random index @xmath5 for the reaction @xmath4 , then updating the reactant state space and time step accordingly .",
    "having been motivated to accommodate random rate constants into the ssa , we present a framework that allows us to extend the ssa to situations where the rate constant is a random variable .",
    "for ease of presentation , we first consider a single reaction scheme involving only one reactant .",
    "subsequently , extending the derivation to reactions with more than one reactant , or to a system of reactions is straightforward .",
    "thus , consider @xmath17 the rate constant @xmath18 is a continuous - time markov process , which represents the time evolution of the fluctuating rate constant .",
    "further properties of the process @xmath19 can be any physically relevant assumptions . in this paper",
    ", we are primarily interested to have @xmath19 possess a stationary distribution with density given by @xmath20 .",
    "the stationarity of @xmath19 is a natural assumption in view of analogous steady state assumptions on the conformational state of a biomolecule @xcite .",
    "the choice for the stationary density is a modelling issue that depends upon the reaction in question , or may be suggested from experimental data .",
    "for example , the gamma distribution was proposed in @xcite , @xmath21 with parameters @xmath22 and where @xmath23 is the gamma function .",
    "although the quantity @xmath3 is a randomly fluctuating process and is no longer constant , we will continue to use the term ` rate constant ' to refer to values that @xmath19 takes at a given time @xmath24 .",
    "we will also refer to the distribution of @xmath19 as the ` rate distribution ' .",
    "the starting point for the modification of the ssa is the idea that , given the rate constant at the time of the last reaction to be @xmath25 , we want to derive a model for the joint density @xmath26 of the waiting time @xmath2 for the next reaction to occur and the rate constant @xmath27 at the time when the next reaction occurs . upon elucidating a model for @xmath26 ,",
    "the algorithm proceeds similarly to the original ssa in a reaction - stepwise fashion , except that now a pair of random numbers @xmath28 is drawn according to @xmath26 , and both the time step and rate constant must be updated . in this way",
    ", the algorithm sees only the rate constants @xmath29 at reaction times , and ignores any underlying properties of the underlying process @xmath19 .",
    ", we are implicitly assuming the markovian property for both the reaction system and the process @xmath19 . the former case can be justified if we assume a well - mixed reaction system , in the sense that each reacting particle s location is uniformly distributed within the reaction volume .",
    "the latter case is a modelling assumption that is made in this paper for simplicity and illustrative purposes . under other compelling physical motivation ,",
    "one may be compelled to develop a non - markovian model for the @xmath29s . ]    determining the joint density @xmath26 is an issue of modelling , and should based on properties of the reactants and chemical system . in general settings , using a joint distribution is a central aspect of the modified algorithm because it captures a wide range of cases where @xmath2 and @xmath27 may or may not be correlated .",
    "one case is a scenario where the process @xmath19 is modelled to evolve as an independent variable on which the distribution of @xmath2 depends as a dependent variable ; the other end of the spectrum are situations where @xmath28 are independent , given @xmath25 .",
    "however , a more delicate and interesting structure of interdependence between @xmath2 and @xmath27 could arise in scenarios where , on the one hand the fluctuations of @xmath27 depend on the length of waiting time allotted , while on the other hand the waiting time depends on the dynamics of the rate constant .    to make the problem of modelling the joint density more tractable ,",
    "it is convenient to factorize the joint density @xmath26 into conditional densities , @xmath30 here , we use @xmath31 as a generic notation for a density . either the first or second equality may be used for constructing the model .",
    "suppose we are given a model for @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the algorithm then proceeds reaction - stepwise as shown in the following table .",
    "the algorithm works analogously if we know @xmath34 and @xmath35 instead .      in order to use the modification of the gillespie s algorithm",
    ", one has to first construct a model based on one of the two conditional density factorizations in . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the latter factorization .",
    "thus , we consider the conditional density @xmath36 , a.k.a . the transition kernel of @xmath19 , to be a model for how @xmath27 fluctuates over the waiting time interval of length @xmath2 ,",
    "given that it starts at @xmath25 .",
    "in general , the transition kernel @xmath36 should represent any physically relevant description of the @xmath3-dynamics .",
    "such a description should be constructed to incorporate information about the stationary distribution , as well as the physical constraints on the dynamics of @xmath3 , that for instance could arise systems where reactants exhibit slow interconversion between conformational states ( e.g. @xcite ) , or in systems with rapid fluctuation of rate constants ( e.g. @xcite ) . in section [ section : single enzyme reaction ] , we will show a case study of slowly interconverting conformers in which we construct the transition kernel with help from the metropolis - hastings algorithm . however , for this section , we will assume that @xmath36 is given to us .",
    "suppose @xmath36 has been determined .",
    "we use the second equality in equation to obtain @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the conditional expected value of @xmath27 given @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the stoichiometric number associated with the number of reactant molecules . in particular , we have derived in appendix [ appdx : tau , c0 ] that @xmath41 this formula indicates that the effective propensity of the reaction is @xmath42 , in the sense that @xmath43 is the probability that the reaction occurs in the infinitesimal time interval @xmath44 .",
    "we observe that the distribution of @xmath2 depends only on the transition dynamics of the process @xmath19  specifically , it depends only on the _ conditional mean _ of @xmath19 in the waiting time interval .",
    "this is an important observation , because it simplifies the modelling demands to rest only on providing a model of @xmath33 .",
    "once @xmath33 is determined , the model for @xmath32 is automatically available , thereby reducing the complexity of the model .",
    "since the cumulative distribution function of @xmath32 is @xmath45 sampling from the density @xmath46 can be achieved by inverting the expression @xmath47 for @xmath2 , where @xmath48 is a uniform random variable on @xmath49 $ ] . in other words , defining @xmath50 , we find @xmath2 by the transformation @xmath51 however , a closed form formula for @xmath52 may not always be readily available , except for special forms of the function @xmath53 ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , and hence numerical approximation procedures will have to be applied to compute @xmath2",

    "this is characterized by rapidly fluctuating dynamics of the rate constant in a shorter time scale than the reaction waiting times .",
    "thus , the approximation aspect of this model assumes the process @xmath19 to be characterized by infinitesimally small correlation lengths , so that the rate constant at the next reaction is independent of its value at the last reaction .",
    "this approximation leads to setting @xmath54 .",

    "in addition to making a simple extension to multiple reactions , we propose a method to model the joint distribution @xmath80 that can be applied quite generally .",
    "a major consideration in the modelling comes from the paper by english et al @xcite , in which it was proposed that the single enzyme reaction exhibits dynamic disorder with the rate constant @xmath3 distributed according to the gamme distribution .",
    "more importantly , the dynamic disorder was suggested to be a result of conformational fluctuations of the enzyme that occur at time scales much larger than product formation time lengths .",
    "we focus our attention for the time being on the product formation reaction step , @xmath81 .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : dynamic disorder mm ] ) holds with the assumption that interconversion of conformers occur much slower than the reaction .",

    ", it should be remarked that the use of the metropolis - hastings algorithm is solely as a way to construct a markov chain possessing a stationary distribution .",
