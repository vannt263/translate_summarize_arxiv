    "the hunt for higgs in the standard model ( sm ) and beyond has been given a big boost with the recently discovered resonance at @xmath4 gev , observed by atlas @xcite and cms @xcite at @xmath5 . while this particle resembles in most features the sm higgs boson , the data hints of enhancements in the @xmath0 event rates ( although this signal is , at about 2@xmath6 , not sufficiently statistically secure ) , as well as depressed rates into @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which could hint at extended symmetries .",
    "the signals are also consistent with the findings at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath0 signals persist with more statistics , they would be an encouraging sign of physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",
    "this possibility has already inspired many explorations in literature @xcite .",
    "the decay into @xmath0 is loop - induced and thus , sensitive to new physics contributions .",
    "the simplest explanation would be the presence of a charged boson in the loop , most likely a charged higgs boson which appears in most bsm scenarios .",
    "in addition , if taken at face value , the suppression of the leptonic modes could be an indication that the neutral boson observed is not a pure sm state , but a mixed state , in which the other component has depressed couplings to leptons .",
    "there are additional hints that more than one higgs bosons might have been observed .",
    "for instance , cms observes an additional excess in @xmath0 and @xmath9 channel at @xmath10 gev @xcite , which also seems to provide a best fit to the tevatron data @xcite .",
    "additionally , lep has observed an excess in @xmath11 near @xmath12 gev @xcite .",
    "this has lead several authors @xcite to investigate the possibility that the data could be fit by not one , but two higgs bosons ; or two degenerate , or nearly degenerate , higgs bosons @xcite .",
    "motivated by these observations , we investigate one of the simplest extensions of the sm , the higgs triplet model ( htm ) with nontrivial mixing in the neutral sector .",
    "we probe whether the cp - even higgs states can explain the signal at 125 gev , and either the additional state at 98 gev , or the one at 136 gev .",
    "the htm has two important ingredients lacking in the sm .",
    "first , it provides an explanation for small neutrino masses @xcite through the seesaw mechanism @xcite : even if the boson at the lhc turns out to be completely consistent with the sm boson , the sm leaves the question of neutrino masses unresolved .",
    "second , the model includes in its higgs spectrum one singly - charged and doubly charged boson , making loop - enhancements of decays into @xmath0 possible .",
    "the neutral higgs sector of the htm has been studied previously @xcite .",
    "various authors have provided analyses showing the @xmath0 signal suppressed with respect to the sm @xcite .",
    "an exception to this is in @xcite , where it was shown that in the case where the triple boson coupling is negative , the decay rates to @xmath0 are enhanced .",
    "but most of the authors have considered the htm for the case in which the mixing in the cp - even neutral bosons is negligible , with the exception of @xcite , where the mixing is assumed to be maximal .",
    "for negligible mixing , the neutral boson visible at lhc is sm - like ( a neutral component of a doublet higgs representation ) with the same tree - level couplings to fermions and gauge bosons , but which also couples to singly and doubly charged higgs bosons , possibly a source on enhancement for the @xmath0 signal .",
    "the production cross sections and decays to @xmath13 and @xmath14 are unchanged with respect to the sm .",
    "should these rates be different , new particles must be added to the model to provide a viable explanation @xcite .",
    "we revisit the model for the case where the mixing is non - negligible , and both states are mixtures of doublet and triplet higgs representations .",
    "we study the tree - level and loop induced ( @xmath0 and @xmath15 ) decays of the two bosons for the case in which @xmath16 gev , @xmath17 gev ( motivated by the cms data ) ; for the case where @xmath18 gev , @xmath19 gev ( motivated by the lep excess ) ; and for the case where the two higgs are degenerate in mass and @xmath20 gev , which is motivated by the case where there is a single boson observed at the lhc . we do not assume specific mixing , but rather study the variation in all parameters due to mixing , and comment on the case where the mixing is negligible as a limiting case .",

    "we have shown that a very simple model , in which only one extra ( triplet ) higgs representation is added to the sm to allow for neutrino masses , shows promise in being able to explain the present data at lhc , and indicated how , with more precise data , this higgs sector can be validated or ruled out .",
