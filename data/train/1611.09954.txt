    "observations of the polarization of synchrotron radio emission from the jets of blazars provide a probe of the underlying magnetic field structure that is thought to play an important role in the dynamics of these highly relativistic flows .",
    "low levels of circularly polarized intensity ( stokes @xmath1 ) have been detected in a number of blazar jets @xcite . while typically @xmath20.5 % of the total intensity ( stokes @xmath3 ) , circular polarization ( cp ) can give us insight into the underlying nature of the jet plasma @xcite . unlike linear polarization ( lp ) , which can be altered by faraday rotation in magnetized plasma both within and external to the jet , cp is produced at levels @xmath4 by the basic synchrotron process , or at potentially higher levels through faraday conversion from lp to cp as the radiation propagates through the jet .",
    "a measurement of the fractional cp ( @xmath5 ) emanating from the jet can probe the charge asymmetry of leptons within the jet plasma , and therefore the ratio of the number of positrons to protons @xcite .",
    "lp from blazars at high radio frequencies ranges from several percent or less to tens of percent , with the higher values tending to occur downstream of the most compact emission ( the `` core '' ) seen on very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) images ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the lp of blazars at optical wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and in the millimeter - wave core @xcite is both variable and weaker than the @xmath6-@xmath7 value from synchrotron emission in a uniform magnetic field , characteristics that can be explained through turbulent disordering of the field .",
    "motivated by such observations , @xcite has developed the turbulent extreme multi - zone ( temz ) model for blazar emission .",
    "the temz model consists of thousands of individual cells of plasma that propagate relativistically across a standing shock in the jet ( figure 1 ) .",
    "each cell of plasma within the model contains a distinct magnetic field that combines a turbulent component with an underlying ordered component .",
    "the aggregate of the emission from these cells is able to reproduce ( in a statistical sense ) the lp that is typically seen in blazars , including the observed level of variability in both degree and position angle @xcite .",
    "the turbulent nature of the magnetic field within the temz grid naturally creates a birefringent environment in which circularly polarized emission can potentially be produced through faraday conversion @xcite .",
    "here we develop a numerical algorithm to carry out polarized radiative transfer through the temz model .",
    "we have embedded this algorithm into the ray - tracing code radmc3d ( see http://ascl.net/1202.015 ) , which we use to image the temz grid .",
    "this makes it possible to compute both lp and cp intensity images as a function of both time and frequency that include the effects of faraday rotation as well as lp to cp conversion .",
    "we combine the turbulently disordered magnetic field with an ordered component , varying the ratio between the two .",
    "the results can be compared to vlbi images as well as to single - telescope polarization measurements .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  2 we summarize the temz model , in  3 we outline the radiative transfer theory adopted in our study , and in  4 we list the model parameters and present an initial ray - tracing calculation through an ordered magnetic field . in  5 we investigate the effect turbulence has on the birefringence of the plasma , while in  6 we carry out a ray - tracing calculation through a disordered magnetic field .",
    "in  7 we compute integrated levels of fractional circular polarization , while in  8 we present synthetic multi - epoch observations . in  9",
    "we explore internal faraday rotation within the temz model . in  10 we investigate how cp depends on plasma composition . in  11 we study spectral polarimetry . finally , ",
    "12 contains our summary and conclusions .",
    "in the temz code @xcite , the jet plasma is divided into thousands of cylindrical cells ( as depicted in figure [ fig1 ] ) , each with uniform physical properties .",
    "simulated turbulence is realized through an adaptation of a scheme by @xcite , in which each cell belongs to four nested zones ( with dimensions of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 cells ) , with each zone contributing a fraction of the turbulent magnetic field and density of the cells that it contains .",
    "these contributions follow a kolmogorov spectrum to determine the relation between the size of the zone and the fraction of the turbulent field component or electron density ( which can include positrons as well ) that the zone provides to its cells .",
    "an ordered component of the magnetic field can optionally be included , superposed on the turbulent field .",
    "the energy density of the particles injected at the upstream end of the jet varies according to a power - law red - noise spectrum .",
    "the magnitudes of the turbulent field and density of each zone are computed randomly within a log - normal distribution , while the direction of the field is also determined randomly at the upstream and downstream borders of the zone and rotated smoothly in between .",
    "this scheme qualitatively reproduces both the randomness of turbulence and correlations among turbulent cells located near each other .",
    "the direction of the turbulent velocity of each cell is chosen randomly ( with magnitude set at a specified fraction of the sound speed ) , and this velocity is added vectorially to the systemic velocity .    the turbulence is assumed to endow the plasma with relativistic electrons that follow a power - law energy distribution . when a plasma cell crosses a standing oblique ( conical in three dimensions ) shock in the millimeter - wave core , its electrons",
    "are heated solely via compression if the magnetic field is not close to parallel to the shock normal , or accelerated to considerably higher energies ( while maintaining the power - law form ) if the field is more favorably oriented ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the component of the magnetic field lying perpendicular to the shock normal , as well as the density , are amplified by the shock compression .",
    "downstream of the shock , a conical rarefaction decompresses the plasma ; beyond this point the emission is considered to contribute only a small fraction of the flux and hence is ignored .",
    "temz computes the synchrotron emission and absorption coefficients in each cell as viewed by the observer , taking into account doppler beaming , the aberrated direction of the magnetic field ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and light - travel delays .",
    "it also calculates inverse compton emission and full time - dependent spectral energy distributions , but the present work is not concerned with these features .",
    "in order to compute both lp and cp at radio frequencies , we need a numerical algorithm to solve the full stokes equations of polarized radiative transfer ( summarized in @xcite ) . in particular , we solve the following matrix along individual rays passing through the temz grid :    @xmath12 q_{\\nu } \\\\[16pt ] u_{\\nu } \\\\[16pt ] v_{\\nu } \\end{array } \\right| = \\left| \\begin{array}{c } \\eta_{\\nu}^{~ i } \\\\[16pt ] \\eta_{\\nu}^{~ q } \\\\[16pt ] \\eta_{\\nu}^{~ u } \\\\[16pt ] \\eta_{\\nu}^{~ v } \\end{array } \\right|\\ ] ]    here , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the frequency - dependent stokes parameters , while @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent , respectively , the emission and absorption coefficients for the corresponding stokes parameters .",
    "the effects of faraday rotation and conversion are governed by the @xmath19 and @xmath20 terms , respectively .",
    "finally , the path length through each cell of plasma is given by @xmath21 .",
    "this matrix has an analytic solution outlined in @xcite .",
    "we apply this analytic solution along individual rays passing through the temz grid ( depicted by a red line in figure [ fig1 ] ) , following the polarized radiative transfer from cell to cell .",
    "we embed this polarized radiative transfer scheme into the ray - tracing code radmc3d .",
    "this code allows one to cast thousands of rays through the temz grid , producing synthetic maps of the resultant polarized emission .",
    "the exact analytic solutions to equation [ eqn1 ] for @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , as well as an expression for the optical depth @xmath22 of each temz cell , are given in appendix a. radmc3d was designed to handle radiative transfer through non - relativistic media .",
    "analytic expressions that account for the effects of relativistic aberration of the rays cast by radmc3d are also outlined in appendix a. in  5 and appendix a we carry out several tests of our algorithm .",
    "table [ tab1 ] lists the various adjustable parameters of the temz code , which include the ratio of ordered magnetic field to the mean turbulent field , the parameter of greatest importance to the present study . as an initial test of the polarized radiative transfer algorithm ,",
    "we have performed a ray - tracing calculation through the vector - ordered magnetic field shown in figure [ fig2 ] . for this calculation ( and the computations below ) ,",
    "the temz grid is composed of over @xmath23 individual plasma cells grouped into eight concentric cylindrical shells forming the recollimation shock depicted in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "these cells of plasma were then mapped onto a uniform @xmath24 cartesian grid through which the ray - tracing calculation was performed .",
    "this grid was input into the radmc3d code , which cast @xmath25 individual rays forming @xmath26 square - pixel maps of the resultant polarized emission .",
    "radmc3d uses a first - order cell - based scheme in which the path length ( @xmath21 ) through each cell is determined and all plasma quantities are zone - centered .",

    "table [ tab1 ] lists the values of the other temz model parameters used in our calculations .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows maps of the fractional circular polarization ( @xmath56 ) emerging from the temz grid . unlike observations that typically show only one sign of cp in a given blazar ,",
    "these synthetic maps contain both positive and negative cp that appear simultaneously .",
    "the levels of circular polarization in these maps reach @xmath57 .",
    "the highest levels of circular polarization observed to emanate from an extragalactic jet are @xmath58 - @xmath59 in the radio galaxy 3c  84 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these preliminary results are encouraging , but the magnetic field structure used here is highly idealized and is unlikely to be realized in the astrophysical context of an actual blazar jet .",
    "after performing the initial ray - tracing calculation presented in  4 , we applied our scheme to the case of a turbulent magnetic field .",
    "one would expect that the increased disorder in the field would increase the birefringence of the jet plasma , leading to increased faraday conversion , as found by @xcite .",
    "it might also cause depolarization of the emission due to the lack of a systematic vector - ordered magnetic field component .",
    "the interplay between these two effects should govern the level of cp produced in a turbulent temz grid . in order to explore these effects in a quantifiable manner ,",
    "we have tracked several emission parameters pertaining to cp production along a random sight - line through the temz model .",
    "as a first test , we recorded the fractional cp ( @xmath60 ) from cell to cell along a given sight - line ( see upper panel of figure [ fig4 ] ) . in one test case ( shown in red in the upper panel of figure [ fig4 ] ) , we plot only the fractional cp intrinsic to each cell . in another test case ( shown in blue in the upper panel of figure [ fig4 ] )",
    ", we also allow faraday conversion to attenuate the emission from cell to cell along our sight - line .",
    "one can clearly see that as our ray passes through the turbulent plasma , faraday conversion increases the observed level of @xmath60 beyond what would be intrinsic to each cell .",
    "we also call attention to the high levels of @xmath60 that are produced within the temz model ( @xmath61 for this particular sight - line ) . these `` extreme '' cp pixels",
    "get `` washed '' out when we convolve our resolved emission maps with a circular gaussian beam ( illustrated in  6,7 below ) , resulting in integrated levels of cp @xmath62-@xmath63 .    as summarized in @xcite and @xcite , the production of cp within blazars most likely results primarily from faraday conversion in a turbulent jet plasma .",
    "this process occurs over two stages .",
    "initially , linearly polarized emission originates from within the jet via synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons entrained in the jet s magnetic fields .",
    "if we choose a suitable reference axis , this process will generate stokes q. internal faraday rotation then converts q into u as the synchrotron radiation propagates through regions with different field orientations ( the cells in the temz model ) , which act as internal faraday screens ( see  9 ) .",
    "faraday conversion , a process uniquely intrinsic to relativistic plasma , then transforms u into v. therefore , the production of cp within a blazar jet is dependent upon both the faraday rotation depth ( @xmath64 ) and the faraday conversion depth ( @xmath65 ) through the intervening jet plasma along the line of sight .",
    "these faraday depths are themselves dependent upon the optical depth ( @xmath22 ) of the jet plasma : @xmath66 and @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath22 are given in appendix a ; their values are specific to the synchrotron process ( see equations [ eqna2 ] , [ eqna11 ] , and [ eqna12 ] , respectively ) .",
    "it then follows that the observed levels of fractional cp are proportional to these faraday depths , @xmath70 . as a second test of cp production in the temz grid , in the lower panel of figure [ fig4 ]",
    "we plot the faraday rotation and conversion depths from cell to cell along the same sight - line shown in the upper panel of figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "while the conversion depth @xmath65 of each cell remains fairly small along this particular sight - line , we do indeed see a marked increase ( in degree ) of the rotation depth @xmath64 along the ray .",
    "it is plausible that this increased internal faraday rotation towards the edge of the jet drives the increase in cp present in the upper panel of figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "an additional test of our cp algorithm is presented in the final section of appendix a.",
    "we proceed to explore the effect that a more turbulent jet environment would have on the cp emission maps produced by radmc3d .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] illustrates the more disordered magnetic field used in our second calculation .",
    "all of the model parameters listed in table [ tab1 ] remain the same as for the ordered field computations , except here @xmath71 , the ratio of the ordered helical magnetic field to the total magnetic field within each temz cell , is set to 0.1 ( figure [ fig5 ] ) . as discussed in  5 , the expectation is that the increased disorder in the turbulent temz field will lead to increased levels of cp .",
    "the images from this second ray - trace are shown in figures [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] .",
    "we convolve these resultant images with a circular gaussian beam with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath72 that is small enough to illustrate the main features of the images .",
    "the increased level of turbulence in this simulation is evident in every image .",
    "we also convolve the images ( shown in appendix b ) with a beam of fwhm  @xmath73as that roughly corresponds to the angular resolution of the longest baselines of a global vlbi array ( or one including an antenna in space ) at short radio wavelengths , for comparison with potential future observations .",
    "the integrated levels of circular polarization ( @xmath74 , shown in the middle panel of figure [ fig7 ] , and discussed in detail in  7 below ) reach @xmath752.6% , which is still in rough agreement with observations of circular polarization in blazars ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , we find very localized levels of fractional circular polarization that can reach as high as @xmath7515% in a disordered ( upstream of the shock ) temz field ( see upper panel of figure [ fig4 ] and figure [ fig14 ] in appendix a ) . in all instances the fractional lp ( @xmath76 )",
    "is much larger than the fractional cp ( @xmath60 ) ; however , @xmath76 always remains below @xmath77 ( the theoretical maximum for synchrotron emission with @xmath78 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the dashed white line in the upper left panel of figure [ fig6 ] delineates an area within which we compute several additional emission properties ( see  7 ) .",
    "the images presented in figure [ fig6 ] are obtained at an observing frequency of @xmath79 .",
    "the i map is positive definite .",
    "the q , u , and v maps exhibit a range of positive and negative values . in figure [ fig6 ]",
    "we plot only positive values for ease of visualization .",
    "a study of the temporal and spectral variability of these synthetic image maps is presented in  8 and  11 .",
    "an animation of the temporal variability in each of the stokes parameter maps over the course of the 5000 time steps of the simulation ( roughly 1000 days in the observer s frame ) can be viewed at http://people.bu.edu/nmacdona/research.html .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ fig7 ] presents a map of linearly polarized intensity ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the orientation of the lp as projected onto the plane of sky is demarcated by electric vector position angles ( evpas ) @xmath81 .",
    "these evpas are shown as black line segments in the upper panel of figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "the value of @xmath81 within a given pixel is computed based on the local values of q and u within that pixel : @xmath82 . as a further test of our algorithm",
    ", we tune our observing frequency until the emission emanating from the temz grid reaches the optically thick limit . as @xmath83",
    "we observe the polarization vectors to rotate by @xmath84 , as predicted by the theory of synchrotron self - absorption @xcite .",
    "images obtained of the polarized intensity in the co - moving frame of the plasma ( similar to figure [ fig3 ] ) clearly show ordering of the initially turbulent magnetic field downstream of the shock .    for all of the calculations presented in this paper , the angle of the jet to our line of sight ( @xmath85 )",
    "is set to @xmath41 .",
    "all of our model parameters are similar to those used by @xcite to model bl lacertae . in the future",
    ", we plan to carry out a more detailed study of the effect that varying degrees of jet inclination can have on the observed levels of cp",
    ". this test will be crucial in determining whether the sign of @xmath60 is sensitive to the large scale orientation of the jet s magnetic field with respect to our line of sight ( see @xcite ) .",
    "at the resolution of vlbi polarized intensity images published thus far , the structure displayed in figures [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] would only be partially resolved or even unresolved . in order to make comparisons between the levels of cp present in our simulations and existing measurements , we therefore compute integrated levels of fractional cp and lp .",
    "this is accomplished by first defining an annulus around the jet emission in our initial i map ( the white dashed circle in the upper left panel of figure [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "we then compute @xmath86 and @xmath87 in each pixel within this annulus , creating the maps of fractional polarization shown in figure [ fig7 ] . to acquire integrated levels of polarization",
    ", we then compute averages of the four stokes parameters within the annulus : @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 . based on these averages",
    ", we compute integrated levels of fractional circular polarization : @xmath92 and fractional linear polarization ( see figure [ fig7 ] ) : @xmath93    as discussed in  6 , the levels of fractional polarization present in figure [ fig7 ] are in rough agreement with observations of cp . in  8 below , we carry out a temporal analysis in which we monitor these integrated levels of polarization over the course of the entire temz simulation . the presence of both negative and positive levels of cp ( simultaneously ) within our maps is a distinct feature that has not been seen in observations of blazar jets , but this may be the result of the cores only being partially resolved by vlbi observations",
    ". it will be of interest to compare our lp synthetic images with the results of upcoming observational campaigns that will image several blazars on @xmath94 scales with various vlbi arrays , including radioastron plus ground based antennas , the global millimeter vlbi array ( gmva ) , and the event horizon telescope ( eht )",
    ". the sensitivity and resolution of these combined arrays should be sufficient to probe the location(s ) in the jet where faraday conversion occurs .",
    "there have been several multi - frequency studies of the temporal variability of cp observed in blazar jets . in particular ,",
    "the university of michigan radio astronomy observatory ( umrao ) has carried out several dedicated programs with single 26 m dish observations at frequencies of 4.8 , 8.0 , and 14.5 ghz ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these campaigns have detected cp at faint but statistically significant levels in a number of blazar jets ( e.g. , 3c 273 , 3c 279 , 3c 84 , and 3c 345 ) .",
    "a marked feature in the temporal variability of cp in these sources is the occurrence of sign reversals in the handedness of the observed fractional cp .",
    "these sign changes occur over a range of timescales ( month to years ) .",
    "it has been suggested that these sudden reversals in the sign of @xmath60 indicate the existence of turbulent magnetic fields within the radio cores of these objects ( see @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite pointed out , however , that there are long time spans ( decades in some cases ) over which the sign of @xmath60 can remain constant .",
    "@xcite suggested that in these objects faraday conversion occurs as the radio waves propagate through a rotationally twisted rather than turbulent magnetic field .",
    "since the twist could result from rotation of the field lines at the base of the jet ( e.g. , if the footprint of the field is in plasma orbiting the black hole ) , cp sign reversals would be quite rare .",
    "these two physical scenarios highlight the potential of using observations of temporal variability in cp as a probe of the underlying physics of jets .    in order to investigate these two scenarios ,",
    "we have carried out a time series analysis of the integrated levels of fractional cp produced by the temz model using two different magnetic field grids : ( i ) the ordered helical magnetic field geometry presented in figure [ fig2 ] , and ( ii ) the turbulent magnetic field depicted in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "we have run the temz model over 5000 time steps .",
    "each time step ( as outlined in @xcite ) is determined by how long it takes one plasma cell to advect down the jet by one cell length ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) . with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath50 and viewing angle of @xmath95 ( table 1 ) , this corresponds to @xmath96 days in the observer s frame .",
    "all images in our time series analysis have been convolved with a circular gaussian beam , one much smaller than that of current vlbi arrays , and one comparable to the highest resolutions available at present . finally ,",
    "as illustrated in figures [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] , we compute integrated levels of fractional circular polarization @xmath74 based on averages of v and i computed within an annulus surrounding the jet emission .",
    "these integrated values are then recorded from one time step to the next , creating synthetic multi - epoch observations .",
    "we perform this analysis for both grids at frequencies of @xmath97 15 , 22 , and 43 ghz .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig8 ] , in which the upper panel illustrates the temporal variability in @xmath74 for the ordered field case , whereas the lower panel highlights the corresponding variability in @xmath74 for a disordered field .",
    "the average value of @xmath74 for each temz run is listed ( for each frequency ) in the lower right of each panel .",
    "the sign of @xmath60 over multiple epochs in the ordered field case , is in keeping with the predictions of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in contrast , when the field is disordered , we indeed see successive reversals in the sign of @xmath74 . at @xmath97 43",
    "ghz the value of @xmath74 is predominantly positive for both runs , whereas at @xmath97 15 and 22 ghz the value of @xmath74 tends to be negative . in ",
    "11 below we carry out a more detailed analysis of the spectral behavior of @xmath98 .",
    "the temporal variability of @xmath60 for a disordered field supports the interpretation proposed by @xcite that reversals in the sign of cp are an observational signature of turbulence within the jet plasma .",
    "we also find a sizable difference in the overall level of cp between the ordered and disordered magnetic field models , as discussed in  5 .",
    "after creating synthetic radio images of the temz model at @xmath99 (  6 &  7 ) , we proceeded to map the amount of internal faraday rotation occurring within the jet . in figure",
    "[ fig9 ] , we present a map of the degree ( @xmath100 ) : @xmath101 by which the orientation of the observed lp angle ( @xmath81 ) is rotated by in each pixel between a ray - tracing calculation in which we include the effects of faraday rotation within the plasma ( @xmath102 ; as discussed in  5 , see equation [ eqn2 ] ) and an identical calculation in which we suppress the effects of faraday rotation within the plasma ( @xmath103 ) . if the faraday rotation is internal to the jet ( as is the case here , since there is no plasma external to the jet in our computations ) , this degree of rotation will be : @xmath104 ( @xcite ) . in equation [ eqn7 ]",
    ", @xmath105 is the faraday rotation depth through the jet plasma , @xmath53 is the lower limit of the electron power - law energy distribution , and @xmath106 is equal to the product of the lepton charge number of the plasma ( @xmath107 ) with the fraction of magnetic field that is in an ordered component ( @xmath108 ) . here , @xmath109 where @xmath110 are the number densities of the electrons / positrons respectively .",
    "within each temz cell the magnetic field is vector - ordered and unidirectional , implying @xmath111 .",
    "we explore different plasma compositions in  10 , but for this calculation we assume a normal plasma with no positrons ( @xmath112 ) . as with our maps of fractional linear and circular polarization ( figure [ fig7 ] ) , we only compute @xmath100 within the white dashed annulus shown in the upper left panel of figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "we find very localized regions of relatively high rotation ( @xmath113 at 43 ghz ) .",
    "it is within these regions that faraday conversion ( which is also proportional to @xmath105 ) should drive the production of cp .",
    "it is useful to compare our map of stokes v ( lower right panel of figure [ fig6 ] ) to the above map of faraday rotation .",
    "the rough similarity of these figures highlights the potential of using polarimetric observations obtained on scales of tens of @xmath114 to constrain where in blazar jets cp is being produced through faraday conversion .",
    "the calculations presented above (   4 - 9 ) have assumed a pure electron - proton plasma within the jet ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "some admixture of positrons within the jet plasma should also be explored . in order to incorporate plasma composition into our ray - tracing calculations ,",
    "we have modified the following emissivity term in our polarized radiative transfer routine ( see appendix a , equation [ eqna12 ] , and @xcite for a more complete discussion ) to include a term accounting for the plasma content of the jet : @xmath116 ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath117 . within an individual temz cell ,",
    "the local magnetic field vector is uniform and unidirectional , implying @xmath118 , while @xmath107 is given in  9 above ( equation [ eqn8 ] ) .",
    "the number density of protons is @xmath119 , since astrophysical plasmas are electrically neutral . in our computations ,",
    "a `` normal '' plasma is assigned a proton to positron ratio of 1000 ( @xmath120 ) , while for a pair plasma the ratio is set at 0.001 ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "figure [ fig10 ] presents a comparison of the resultant emission from snapshots of the temz results with the two different plasma compositions .",
    "it is evident in these images that cp is indeed a highly sensitive probe of the plasma content of the jet .",
    "as discussed in  5 , there are two distinct physical processes by which circularly polarized emission can be produced within a relativistic jet .",
    "cp can emanate either _ intrinsically _ ( @xmath122 ) from synchrotron emission or through faraday _ conversion _ ( @xmath123 ) ; @xcite .",
