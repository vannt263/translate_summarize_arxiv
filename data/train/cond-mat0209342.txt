    "the investigation of the specific heat @xmath2 is an important tool for understanding the nature of the superconductivity and anisotropy of the superconducting gap @xmath3 on the fermi surface @xmath4 .",
    "historically the relative specific heat jump @xmath5 was used to establish the bcs picture@xcite for the conventional superconductors having nearly isotropic gap .",
    "subsequently the thermodynamics of clean anisotropic - gap superconductors was analyzed in the weak coupling approximation by pokrovsky and ryvkin .",
    "@xcite they have found that anisotropy suppresses the value @xmath5 in comparison to its isotropic value 1.43 .",
    "this inequality is not satisfied in classical low - temperature superconductors partly because they are not extremely clean , but also since the weak coupling approximation has a poor precision .",
    "geilikman and kresin @xcite have proved that the first correction due to interaction increases @xmath5 and thus disguises the anisotropy effect .",
    "the modern superconductors display really high anisotropy .",
    "in particular , superconductivity is highly anisotropic in mgb@xmath1 .",
    "this fact is the main motivation of this work .",
    "it is well known that only superconducting crystals of very high quality can reach the theoretical clean - limit asymptotics . as a rule ,",
    "the reduced specific heat jump is sample - dependent and understanding of this disorder dependence is a challenging problem .",
    "the latter is especially important for mgb@xmath6 a compound now being in the limelight of superconductor materials science .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to derive the dependence of the critical temperature and the relative specific heat jump @xmath7 on the elastic scattering time of the charge carriers at the critical temperature @xmath8 for two - band superconductors having in mind application to mgb@xmath1 .",
    "for this purpose we need corresponding formulae for a general dirty anisotropic superconductor .",
    "such equations were derived in @xcite .",
    "we reproduce them here for readers convenience and because there occurred several misprints in the cited work which we correct here . in the @xmath9-approximation the electrical resistivity of the normal metal @xmath10",
    "is determined by this scattering time .",
    "thus , our formula can be used for the investigation of correlations in the experimentally determined @xmath5 versus @xmath11 plot .",
    "the comparison of the theoretical curve and the experimental data can reveal the gap anisotropy @xmath12 and the scattering rate @xmath13 .",
    "the gap can depend on both the quasimomentum @xmath14 and the band index @xmath15    the applicability of the weak - coupling theory to mgb@xmath1 is contentious .",
    "however , experimental results on the relative specific heat discontinuity@xcite indicate that the anisotropy effect is more profound than the effect of interaction . for this compound ,",
    "the reduced specific heat @xmath5 is definitely smaller than the weak - coupling bcs value 1.43 .",
    "moreover the temperature dependence of the specific heat of the superconducting phase is described fairly well@xcite by the two - band model@xcite and the relative specific heat jump agrees@xcite with the moskalenko s weak - coupling formula.@xcite the comparison of the latter and the _ ab initio _ strong - coupling calculations@xcite for mgb@xmath1 shows that the decrease of @xmath5 due to different values of the superconducting gap for different bands is at least 2 times bigger than the increase of this reduced specific heat jump due to the strong coupling effects .",
    "we discuss this point in the concluding discussion .",
    "in this section we reproduce some results for an anisotropic clean superconductors obtained by different authors many years ago and derive equation for the specific jump discontinuity in this case .",
