    "circumstellar disks are of fundamental importance for the physical processes of star and planet formation . during protostellar evolution , disks provide the primary channel for accreting interstellar gas and dust that ultimately make up a star .",
    "circumstellar disks are also the formation sites of planetary systems such as our own solar system . characterizations of the frequency and lifetimes of such disks is important for developing an understanding of disk evolution and planet formation .",
    "circumstellar disks are most readily detected and identified by their infrared emission .",
    "in particular , the optical - infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of stars with circumstellar disks are expected to display a characteristic power - law shape or signature ( e.g. , lynden - bell & pringle 1974 ) .",
    "this expectation has been largely confirmed by observations ( e.g. , rucinski 1986 ; adams , lada and shu 1987 , beall 1987 , etc . )",
    "moreover , the detailed shape of a disk s sed is also expected to be sensitive to the structure and mass of the disk ( e.g. , adams , lada & shu 1988 , kenyon and hartmann 1987 , wood et al 2001 , etc ) .    because of the difficulty in obtaining the sufficient wavelength coverage necessary to construct seds of disk - bearing stars , most statistical studies of the frequencies and lifetimes of circumstellar disks have relied on using measurements of infrared excess at a single wavelength ( usually the longest wavelength permitted by ground based imaging systems , typically either 2.2 microns or 3.4 microns ) , as a proxy for disk identification",
    ". measurements of such near - infrared excesses in embedded clusters have indicated high disk frequencies for the youngest stars but relatively short disk lifetimes ( e.g. , haisch , lada & lada 2001a ) . however , ground - based measurements based on excess detection at a single wavelength in the near - infrared are inherently limited ; they are useful for detecting the presence of disks but provide little information about the more detailed nature ( mass , structure , etc . ) of disks ( wood et al .",
    "moreover , such measurements are subject to systematic uncertainties in such assumed parameters as the adopted intrinsic colors of stars and extinction law assumed and these uncertainties could directly impact the derived statistics .",
    "spitzer  _ satellite has greatly improved the ability to confidently identify and study circumstellar disks by making it possible to obtain seds for young stellar objects over an interesting range of wavelength extending well into the mid - infrared wavelength bands in reasonable amounts of observing time ( e.g. , hartmann et al . 2005 ; sicilia - aguilar et al .",
    "mid - infrared wavelengths are ideal for studying disks because these wavelengths are well removed from the peak of the underlying stellar energy distribution resulting in much greater excesses over the underlying stellar photosphere .    as part of the _ spitzer  _ gto program a number of young embedded clusters",
    "have been imaged with both the irac and mips cameras with the goal of investigating disk evolution .",
    "the first paper resulting from this program examined two clusters ( tr  37 and ngc  7160 ) of differing age ( 4 and 10 myr respectively ) but at the same distance ( 900 pc ) from the sun ( sicilia - aguilar et al .",
    "these clusters exhibited significantly different disk fractions ( 48% and 4% , respectively ) suggesting significant disk evolution between 4 and 10 myr in these systems .",
    "in addition evidence for disk evolution within the clusters was also suggested by the identification of a small but significant population of disk bearing stars with optically thin inner disk regions and infrared excesses only at wavelengths longward of 4.5 @xmath1 m . in this paper",
    "we present and analyze _",
    "spitzer  _ observations of the ic  348 cluster which is the nearest ( 320 pc ) , relatively rich , embedded cluster to the sun and thus a prime target for the cluster disk evolution program . situated at one end of the perseus molecular cloud complex ,",
    "ic  348 is at an intermediate age ( 2 - 3 myrs ) for embedded clusters and only partially embedded in natal gas and dust .",
    "its proximity has made it an important laboratory for investigating early stellar evolution and star formation .",
    "the cluster has been extensively studied and a great deal of effort has been directed toward determining its membership , primarily through spectroscopic investigations with the result that most of its members are likely known and confirmed ( e.g. , luhman et al . 1998 ; 2003 ; 2005 ) .",
    "the confirmed membership is relatively large ( @xmath0 300 stars ) covering a wide range in mass from 0.02 to 5 with excellent statistical representation . because of the cluster s proximity , _",
    "spitzer  _ observations enable us to accurately measure the frequency of infrared excess and circumstellar disks around the lowest mass stars down to and below the hydrogen burning limit . in this way we are able to obtain for the first time a robust disk census at the peak of the stellar imf .",
    "previous studies of the disk population in this cluster have produced differing estimates of the disk fraction .",
    "near - infrared @xmath5 observations produced an estimate of the disk fraction of @xmath0 15% for the population ( lada & lada 1995 ) while longer wavelength @xmath6 ( 3.4 microns ) observations yielded a disk fraction of @xmath0 @xmath7 for the 100 brightest members ( haisch , lada & lada 2001b ) . similarly , h@xmath4 observations ( herbig 1998 ) appeared to suggest a disk fraction of @xmath0 50% . at the same time searches for millimeter - wave continuum from disks in the cluster failed to detect a single disk suggesting that as a whole the disk masses in ic  348 were lower than those that characterize the taurus cloud complex ( carpenter 2002 ) .    in this paper",
    "we report new measurements on the disk fraction based on _",
    "spitzer  _ satellite observations at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 and 24.0 microns using the irac and mips cameras .",
    "we are able to construct the seds of @xmath0 300 confirmed members of the cluster and derive improved and more accurate disk frequencies enabling the investigation of disk evolution in considerable more detail than possible in previous studies .",
    "as a part of the guaranteed time observations of the irac and mips instrument teams , we obtained images of ic  348 at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 , and @xmath8with irac and mips on the _ _",

    "at each cell in the map , images were obtained in the 12  s high dynamic range mode , which provided one 0.4  s exposure and one 10.4  s exposure .",
    "the map was performed twice with offsets of several arcseconds between the two iterations .",
    "the resulting shallow maps had centers of @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( j2000 ) for 3.6 and @xmath18  and @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( j2000 ) for 4.5 and @xmath13 , dimensions of @xmath21 , and position angles of @xmath22 for the long axes .",

    "were combined into one mosaic at each of the four bands using custom idl software developed by robert gutermuth .",
    "point sources in these data were identified with the task daofind under the iraf package apphot .",
    "aperture photometry for these sources then was extracted with the task phot using a radius of two pixels ( @xmath31 ) for the aperture and inner and outer radii of two and three pixels for the sky annulus .",
    "we selected these relatively small apertures and sky annuli to provide the best possible subtraction of background emission from the parent cloud of ic  348 , which is bright and spatially variable at mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "for an aperture radius of 10 pixels and a sky annulus extending from 10 to 20 pixels , we adopted zero point magnitudes ( @xmath32 ) of 19.670 , 18.921 , 16.855 , and 17.394 in the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8  @xmath1 m bands , where @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "we then applied aperture corrections of 0.274 , 0.298 , 0.543 , and 0.769  mag to the photometry .",
    "the photometry from the shallow and deep images were merged into one catalog .",
    "we used sources found in both catalogs to characterize our photometric uncertainties .",
    "a total of 764 , 817 , 308 and 223 overlapping sources were found in bands 1 - 4 , respectively . of these @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    "had observed 1 sigma scatter less than 0.1 magnitudes .",
    "only @xmath38 of the overlap sources had 1 sigma variations which were greater than the 3 sigma predicted photometric errors calculated from the aperture photometry and which includes sky background , read and shot nosie .",
    "these estimates of the photometric accuracy are particularly relevant for known cluster members , which fall predominately within this overlap region . in this",
    "combined data set , one bright star , hd  23180 ( @xmath39 ) , lacks unsaturated measurements at 3.6 and @xmath40 .",
    "observations of ic 348 using the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ; rieke et al .",
    "2004 ) were taken in february 2004 .",
    "the cluster was mapped using scan mode with 12 0.5-degree scan legs and half - array cross - scan overlap , resulting in a total map size of about 0.5 x 1.5 degrees including overscan and overlapping completely the irac observations .",
    "the total effective exposure time per point at @xmath41  is about 80 seconds .",
    "the mips images were processed using the instrument team data analysis tool , which calibrates the data and applies a distortion correction to each individual exposure before combining into a final mosaic ( gordon et al .",
    "point source photometry was performed on the 24 @xmath1 m mosaic using psf fitting with _",
    "daophot_. except in a few cases where faint sources lay near bright extended background emission , the measurement errors are dominated by the 10% uncertainty in the absolute flux calibration .",
    "we do not consider data from the other two mips channels in this contribution .",
    "in this paper we consider only the observations of @xmath42 cluster stars with confirmed membership by luhman et al ( 2003 ) .",
    "these cluster members were initially selected from a complete magnitude - limited sample of stars whose optical - infrared colors placed them above the main sequence for the distance of this cluster .",
    "spectra and near - infrared photometry exists for a significant fraction of these candidate members .",
    "membership for these stars was assessed on the basis of the following factors : known proper - motions , the presence of li absorption , spectroscopic indication of low surface gravity , photometric evidence of extinction , presence of emission lines and/or infrared excess .",
    "the membership sample is thus not biased toward disk bearing stars since the selection was not limited to stars with observed signatures of disks such as emission - line or infrared - excess stars .",
    "the sample is known to be complete within a 16 by 14 arc minute region centered on the cluster for stars with masses greater than 0.03 solar masses and for visual extinctions less than 4 magnitudes ( luhman et al .",
    "this area encompasses 75% of the confirmed members examined in this paper . in table",
    "[ tab : catalog ] we present a catalog of the irac and mips photometry for all sources .",
    "we combined our _",
    "_  _ irac  _  and _ mips  _  data with ground - based near - infrared and optical observations from the literature to construct spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for all the sources in the catalog .",
    "we present an atlas of these seds for the members of ic  348 in appendix [ app : atlas ] .",
    "the examination of the optical - infrared sed of a target star provides the most robust method for the identification of the presence of a circumstellar disk .",
    "the shape of the sed can distinguish a disk origin for observed infrared excesses from other possible causes and moreover is sensitive to such parameters as disk structure , orientation and if extended to millimeter - wavelengths , the size distribution of emitting particles .",
    "a particularly useful measure of the shape of an sed is its slope ( e.g. , lada 1987 ) .",
    "here we use the @xmath43  slope of the irac sed for each of the 263 sources in our catalog / atlas that was detected in all four irac bands to identify stars with disks and obtain a census of the circumstellar disk population in the cluster .",
    "we obtain our metric for the sed slope , @xmath4 , from a simple power - law , least - squares fit to the four irac bands for each star .",
    "the results of this procedure are shown in figure [ sedslopes ] where we plot the slopes we derived for the stars in ic  348 as a function of spectral type .",
    "for reference we also derive the same diagram for stars in taurus with published irac data ( hartmann et al .",
    "2005 ) .    in both clouds the sources primarily cluster around two distinct bands , one centered on an @xmath4 @xmath44 -1.0 and the other centered on an @xmath4 @xmath44 -2.7 corresponding to disk - bearing and diskless stars , respectively .",
    "examination of the sed slopes in taurus shows a distinct separation between objects within the two bands .",
    "this separation between diskless stars and disk - bearing stars has been noticed previously and has been interpreted to indicate a rapid transition between the two phases of evolution ( kenyon & hartmann 1995 ; wood et al . 2002 ) . in the sed atlas in appendix [ app : atlas ]",
    "we compare individual source optical - infrared seds to two disk models calculated from a monte carlo radiative transfer code ( bjorkman & wood , 2001 ; wood et al .",
    "2002 ; walker et al .",
    "the model disks extend from the dust destruction radius to 200 au and are purely reprocessing disks with no accretion . for both models",
    "the disk mass is 3% of the stellar mass and the radial dependence of the disk surface density is @xmath45 . the dust size distribution used in the models",
    "is described in wood et al .",
    "one model is flared consistent with the requirements of vertical hydrostatic equilibrium while the other has a scale height reduced by a factor of 3 to approximate a disk which is spatially flatter as would be expected for a disk that has experienced significant mid - plane settling of its emitting dust . from a comparison of the observed seds , sed slopes and models",
    "we find that sources with disks that match the models ( flared or flat ) are characterized by @xmath4 @xmath3 -1.8 . from an examination of the sed slopes of apparently diskless stars in taurus",
    ", we find that diskless stars ( i.e. , stellar photospheres ) can be characterized by @xmath4 @xmath46 -2.56 .",
    "we note that the value of @xmath47 for stellar photospheres can vary with spectral type .",
    "indeed , we have examined the dependence of @xmath47 on spectral type for dereddened diskless stars in taurus and found that it can be well approximated by a linear function which is displayed in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure [ sedslopes ] .",
    "the variation in @xmath4 is small across the range of spectral types under consideration .",
    "therefore for simplicity , we adopt a single photospheric value of @xmath48 , which corresponds to the predicted slope for an m0 star ( -2.66 ) plus a buffer of 0.1 to account for the typical precision of these sed fits ( see , for example , table [ tab : alphafits ] ) .",
    "sources characterized by -2.56 @xmath46 @xmath4 @xmath46 -1.80 we term anemic disks and are possibly transition objects , such as heavily depleted , optically thin disks , disks with inner holes , etc .",

    "[ med_seds ] we plot the median seds for each of the three sed types ( thick disk , anemic disk , diskless photosphere ) for the different spectral classes ( see appendix [ app : median ] for the derivation of ic  348 median seds ) .",
    "we note that anemic disks display very small excesses primarily only at the longest wavelengths and even where detected they typically have fluxes below that expected for an optically thick disk .",
    "comparison with the median sed of taurus disk - bearing stars with spectral types between k2-m0 indicates that for the stars in this spectral type range the circumstellar disks in ic 348 and taurus are very similar in nature .",
    "although for m0-m2 the median ic348 sed falls below the taurus sed suggesting perhaps that some disk evolution or dust settling may have occured in ic  348 , similar to the situation in the 4 myr cluster tr  37 ( sicilia - aguilar et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "we compute the disk fractions as a function of spectral type and mass and plot the result in figure [ diskfreq_sed ] . here",
    "we display the fraction of sources for which @xmath4 @xmath3 -1.80 ( optically thick disks ) , the fraction of sources with -1.8 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath3 -2.65 ( anemic or thin disks ) and the total disk fraction as a function of spectral type and stellar mass .",
    "the stellar mass is derived by converting the spectral types to effective temperatures using a subgiant temperature scale ( luhman 1999 ) and the effective temperatures to masses using the baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) pre- main sequence evolutionary model calculations appropriate for a 2 - 3 myr cluster .",
    "this is a satisfactory conversion for our purposes since at these ages nearly all these stars are on convective tracks in the hr diagram .",
    "the disk fraction appears to be a function of spectral type ( mass ) .",
    "the disk fraction is lowest for stars with spectral types earlier than k6 and highest for stars with spectral types between k6-m2 , that is , for stars with masses around 1 solar mass . for later spectral types there appears to be a definite decline in the disk fraction . given the level of uncertainty on the individual points , the significance of this drop is difficult to assess .",
    "however the fact that the four contiguous lowest mass bins are systematically lower than the preceeding two bins suggests that the fall off is real . to better assess the variation of disk fraction with spectral type we can calculate the disk fractions over wider intervals of spectral type and mass .",
    "more specifically , for all stars earlier than k6 we find disk fractions of 11 @xmath2 8% and 8 @xmath2 8% for optically thick disks and anemic disks , respectively . for stars between k6-m2",
    "we find the corresponding disk fractions to be 47 @xmath2 12% and 9 @xmath2 5% and for stars between m2-m6 ( which make up the last four bins of figure [ diskfreq_sed ] ) we find the corresponding disk fractions to be 28 @xmath2 5% and 26 @xmath2 5% .",
    "the decline of the optically disk fraction for the later spectral type / lowest mass stars is apparently significant .",
    "the fraction of all cluster members detected in all four irac bands with optically thick disks is found to be 30 @xmath2 4% , while the total disk fraction ( optically thick @xmath49 anemic disks ) for this population of sources is 50 @xmath2 6% .",
    "we note here that our disk census applies to the entire cluster membership .",
    "if we restrict our sample to only those cluster members located within the inner 16 by 14 arc min region of the cluster known to be complete for @xmath50 @xmath3 0.03 ( luhman et al .",
    "2003 ) , we derive nearly identical disk fractions as those computed above for the larger sample but with somewhat larger uncertainties .      in figure [ irac_cc ]",
    "we plot the irac color - color diagram for the cluster .",
    "we have labeled the points in the figure with different symbols which correspond to stars whose irac sed slopes indicated whether they were diskless or surrounded by thick or anemic disks respectively .",
    "there is a continuous sequence in color from diskless stars to stars with progressively large excesses and increasingly substantial disks .",
    "the stars are clearly spatially segregated according to the nature of their surrounding disks , unlike previous irac only studies of embedded clusters we find the gap between disk - bearing and diskless stars to be filled by stars with anemic disks .",
    "not all cluster members were detected in all irac bands , however , essentially all the members were detected at 4.5 @xmath1 m . consequently , to obtain a more complete disk census for the entire cluster membership ,",
    "we need to rely on analysis of shorter wavelength data and employ color - color diagrams .",
    "we have used the data in table 1 to construct color - color diagrams combining @xmath5 photometry with @xmath40  irac photometry for the ic  348 cluster members in order to identify sources with infared excesses and compile a more complete excess / disk census for the cluster .",
    "infrared excesses are derived in color - color diagrams from comparison of the observed colors with the intrinsic colors of normal diskless stars .",

    "these boundaries are trajectories that parallel the reddening vector for stars of the differing spectral types .",
    "although figure [ jhk4_cc_all ] shows the reddening boundaries for three spectral types , we have calculated the total disk fraction for the cluster as a function of spectral type by using the appropriate reddening boundary for eight spectral type bins from a stars to late m stars and counting the number of stars to the right of that boundary . the disk fraction determined in this manner",
    "is plotted in figure [ diskfreq_cc ] .",
    "the result for the entire population is very similar to that derived above using sed slopes for the somewhat more restricted sample of sources detected in all four iras bands .",
    "this figure confirms the decline in disk fraction with spectral type below a solar mass . the fact that the disk fraction derived in this way is lower than the total disk fraction from figure [ diskfreq_sed ] indicates that most anemic disks do not show excess at @xmath55 .",
    "we did not calculate the disk fraction for stars later than m6 since this was done in an earlier contribution by luhman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) who employed irac only color - color diagrams to derive the disk fraction for the brown dwarf population in ic 348 from the _ spitzer  _ observations .",
    "they found the disk fraction for stars later than m6 to be 42 @xmath2 13% .",
    "this is higher than the disk fraction derived for the earlier type m stars and the cluster as a whole and may indicate a slight increase in the disk fraction below the hydrogen burning limit .    in figure [ jhk4_cc_all ]",
    "the stellar colors are plotted as different symbols with the filled circles representing stars found to have optically thick disks from analysis of their seds while the plus signs correspond to stars identified as possessing anemic disks .",
    "the diagram suggests that a reasonably accurate census of the thick disk fraction can be measured by adopting the m6 reddening boundary without consideration of the individual spectral types of the target stars . thus if spectral types are not available using the @xmath56 m color - color diagram with the m6 reddening boundary can produce a good estimate of the primordial disk fraction for a young stellar population .",
    "the disk fractions we derive for the ic  348 cluster in figure [ diskfreq_cc ] are significantly lower than that ( @xmath0 50% ) derived by haisch et al .",
    "( 2001b ) using ground - based @xmath6 band observations in a similar analysis .",
    "the difference is attributable to two factors .",
    "first , haisch et al . examined a magnitude limited ( @xmath57 mag . )",
    "sample of 107 stars , about a third the size of the sample considered here .",
    "spitzer  _ sample is dominated by late m stars which have a lower disk fraction than the k and early m stars that dominated the magnitude - limited haisch et al . sample .",
    "second , and more significant , is that there appears to be a difference in the observed 3 @xmath1 m colors of the stars in the two samples .",
    "if we examine the 95 sources in common between our two studies we derive a disk fraction of 36% from an analysis of the @xmath5 _ irac  _  3.6 @xmath1 m color - color diagram using the same boundary for the reddening band as adopted by haisch et al . this difference in derived disk fraction appears to be largely the result of the fact that the @xmath58 m colors of the stars in the present study appear to be bluer than the @xmath59 colors of haisch et al .",
    "the origin of this difference is not clear but may be due to systematic calibration uncertainties the 3.6 @xmath1 m observations .",
    "however based on analysis of the stellar seds , it appears that the irac data produce the more a reliable measure of the disk / excess fraction .    in figure [ irac_mips ]",
    "we plot an irac - mips color - color diagram for those sources in the cluster detected at @xmath60 .",
    "different symbols represent the different disk types ( thick and anemic ) as well as diskless stars as determined from irac colors .",
    "sources with thin or anemic disks form a narrow band with little dispersion in 3.6-@xmath61 color but a wide extent in @xmath62 color .",
    "this band forms the lower boundary to the extent of thick disk sources in this color - color plane .",
    "the distribution of anemic disk sources appears to be less concentrated in the @xmath63  color than that of the thick disk sources . for the anemic disks the contrast between inner and outer disk emission increases as the @xmath64  color increases .",
    "the six anemic sources with the largest @xmath60  excesses represent objects with the largest contrast between inner and outer disk emission and may be disks with significant inner holes .",
    "the majority of anemic disk sources do not appear to possess such significant inner holes .",
    "we also note the presence in figure [ irac_mips ] of two small groupings of stars whose @xmath65 color is close to zero magnitude .",
    "eight out of nine of these stars show no indication of infrared excess in any of the irac bands , while one ( source # 8 , see table [ tab : catalog ] ) is identified as an anemic disk by its sed slope .",
    "three of these sources have @xmath66 m colors close to zero magnitude , characteristic of diskless photospheres out to 24 @xmath1 m wavelength .",
    "two are g stars ( # s 11 & 22 ) and one is a k star ( # 10363 ) . a fourth source , an a star ( # 3 ) , also exhibits a near photospheric @xmath67 m color but appears to have a slight excess in the 24@xmath1 m band .",
    "a second grouping of five stars is clustered around an @xmath66 m color of @xmath0 1.4 magnitudes .",
    "four of these stars appear to be diskless in the irac bands but clearly exhibit excess at 24 @xmath1 m .",
    "two of the stars are early type a stars ( # s 7 & 25 ) while another is an f star ( # 30 ) and one is a g star ( # 20 ) .",
    "these stars could either be extreme examples of anemic ( transiton ) disks or very young debris disk systems . to distinguish between these two possible interpretations",
    "requires knowledge of whether the circumstellar material producing the 24 @xmath1 m excess is remnant primordial disk material or newly generated dust produced by collisions between planetesimals and this is very difficult to ascertain with the exisitng observations for such a young cluster .",
    "we have obtained a detailed census of circumstellar disks among the members of the ic  348 cluster using observations from the _",
    "spitzer  _ satellite coupled with extensive ground - based data from the literature .",
    "the total disk fraction for the cluster membership is found to be 50 @xmath2 6% but only 30 @xmath2 4% of the members bear optically thick primordial disks . both these fractions are lower than previously estimated from ground - based @xmath6 band observations , although they are consistent with a normal extrapolation of the measured ground - based k @xmath68 band excess fraction ( lada & lada 1995 ) .",
    "our observations provide evidence once again for rapid disk evolution in clusters . if all stars in this cluster started out with circumstellar disks ,",
    "then our data indicate that between roughly @xmath69 of the cluster members have lost their primordial disks in only 2 - 3 myrs .",
    "however we also find that the disk fraction for this cluster is also a function of spectral type and thus stellar mass .",
    "the early type stars exhibit a very low disk fraction consistent with earlier findings ( haisch et al . 2001b ) and suggesting that @xmath0 90 % of stars earlier than k6 have lost their disks in only 2 - 3 myrs .",
    "the disk fraction peaks for late k and early m stars , which are solar mass objects at the age of the cluster and roughly 50% of these solar analogs have managed to retain their original disks over the lifetime of the cluster .",
    "surprisingly the disk fraction drops for later spectral type stars that dominate the cluster membership .",
    "only about 30% of these stars have retained optically thick disks , suggesting perhaps that their rate of evolution is between that of the early type stars and solar type stars .",
    "an expected consequence of disk evolution is a change in disk structure due to the settling of small dust grains toward the disk midplane .",
    "this produces a reduction in the scale height of the emitting particles and an overall decrease in the level of excess emission across the disk sed .",
    "recently evidence for such evolution in seds of young stars was obtained in sptizer observations by sicilia - aguilar et al .",
    "these authors compared the seds of stars in three stellar gourps of differing age , taurus ( 1 - 2 myr ) , tr  37 ( 4 myr ) and ngc  7160 ( 10 myr ) .",
    "in addition to the expected overall decrease in disk fraction with age , they found a correlation of disk flux or infrared excess with age , such that the stars that retained disks exhibited lower disk fluxes with increasing age .",
    "the disk fluxes at the shorter wavelengths , presumably from the inner disk regions , seemed to decrease more rapidly than those at the longest ( i.e. , @xmath70 ) wavelength .",
    "as mentioned earlier and shown in figure [ med_seds ] , the median sed for ic  348 disk bearing stars is very similar to the corresponding median sed for taurus sources , suggesting similar disk structure for corresponding sources in the two clouds .",
    "thus , even though ic  348 has a lower overall disk fraction , its surviving disks do not seem significantly different in structure than those in taurus .",
    "in figure [ sed_evolution ] we display the seds of four sources taken from our atlas of seds as a representative sample of various sed shapes we find for cluster stars .",
    "these objects are of similar spectral type ( m0 - m2 ) but exhibit different levels of infrared excess due to circumstellar disks .",
    "they range from a strongly flared disk to a diskless photosphere .",
    "these seds clearly represent systematically varying disk structure for sources within the cluster . for comparison",
    "appropriate synthetic stellar photospheres and two disk models of differing scale height but similar inclination ( i.e. , i @xmath71 60@xmath72 ) are also plotted for each star ( see appendix 1 for details ) .",
    "comparison with the model disks and photospheres suggests that the decrease in disk emission from top to bottom is likely a result of a change in disk scale height .",
    "this , in turn , may be a sign of disk evolution due to dust settling .",
    "if so , this suggests that the rate of disk evolution can vary within a single , similarly aged , population of young stars .",
    "it is interesting in this regard that we find that for cluster members with spectral types earlier than m2 , @xmath73 of the disk - bearing stars have seds that closely match the prediction of the most flared model disk ( i.e. , the upper disk model curve in figure [ sed_evolution ] ) while 90% of the disk - bearing stars with spectral types later than m4 exhibit seds that lie below this model , coincident with or slightly above the prediction of the reduced scale height disk model ( i.e. , the lower disk model curve ) .",
    "thus the disks around the lowest mass , late - type stars are flatter and presumably more evolved than the disks around the earlier type and solar mass stars .",
    "this is interesting given that the disk fraction around these later type stars is also lower or more evolved than that for the solar mass stars in the cluster .",
    "however , it is interesting to note here that modeling of disks around brown dwarfs in ophiuchus also suggested flatter disk structure for such very low mass objects ( natta et al 2002 ) .",
    "the rapid disk evolution times suggested by our observations are a challenge for theories of planet formation which typically require periods of order 10@xmath74 years or longer to build jupiter mass objects .",
    "however , our data also suggest that the disk evolution time scale is a function of stellar mass and may peak for stars similar in mass to the sun .",
    "thus in ic  348 the conditions for planet building may be most favorable around stars with masses similar to our sun .",
    "we have so far considered the properties of optically thick disks which are likely to be primordial , protoplanetary disks .",
    "we have also identified a population of anemic or optically thin disks in the cluster .",
    "these disks appear to be typically detected only at the longest wavelengths , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the fraction of sources surrounded by such disks ranges from about 8% for the earliest type stars to 25% for the later type stars .",
    "however while such anemic disks are a small portion of the disk - bearing early - type ( @xmath46k6 ) stars , they represent a large fraction ( 1/2 ) of the disk - bearing late - type ( @xmath3m3 ) stars .",
    "this perhaps is another indication of more advanced evolution for the disks around lower mass stars .",
    "source 72 , whose sed is shown in figure [ sed_evolution ] , is an interesting object because it is an example of an anemic disk whose @xmath41  ( outer disk ) emission is as bright as that from the thick and flared primordial disks shown in the upper two panels of figure [ sed_evolution ] .",
    "this suggests the presence of a significant inner disk hole with a fairly pronounced ring of outer disk emission .",
    "examination of the seds in the atlas suggests that the evolution from a flared to a flat disk structure that is implied by the arrangement of seds in figure [ sed_evolution ] is fairly typical in that the @xmath77  flux almost always drops with the fluxes at shorter wavelengths .",
    "this is consistent with what one might expect if disks evolved more or less homologously ( e.g. , wood et al .",
    "sources such as 72 represent an exception .",
    "their strong excess at @xmath77  could either result from a sequence of inside - out evolution in which the dust in the outer disk remained puffed up as the dust in the inner disk rapidly settled or perhaps a sequence in which dust in the outer disk first settled to the mid - plane and then later was puffed up again as the inner disk cleared .",
    "only 37% of the anemic disk sources have been detected at @xmath60 .",
    "these are the sources identified in the irac - mips color - color diagram ( figure [ irac_mips ] ) .",
    "this low detection fraction is the result of inadequate sensitivity at @xmath60 and so these particular sources are clearly the objects with the largest @xmath60 excesses among the anemic disk population .",
    "only 6 ( or 33% ) of these sources exhibit @xmath63 colors as extreme as source 72 .",
    "the remaining anemic sources have @xmath63  colors which span a similar range as those of optically thick disks .",
    "in addition , examination of the individual seds shows that about half the anemic disks detected at 24 @xmath1 m appear to be thin at 24 @xmath1 m . these facts suggest that most disks may undergo substantial evolution without developing significant inner holes , that is , the inner and outer regions are more or less simultaneously being depleted by the evolutionary process .",
    "however , it is not clear from our observations whether the rates of inner and outer disk evolution could still differ somewhat for these sources .",
    "the data we have analyzed and discussed provides insights into inner ( .1 - 5.0 au ) disk evolution as traced by small dust grains .",
    "it is not clear whether the evolution of the gaseous component of the disk proceeds in a similar manner or on a similar timescale . one proxy for tracing the evolution of",
    "the gas is via measurements of disk accretion onto the central star via observation of atomic emission lines .",
    "in particular the h@xmath4 emission is thought give an indication of the level of disk accretion onto the star . indeed , hartigan et al .",
    "( 1990 ) found a correlation between optical veiling , which is an indirect measure of accretion , and h@xmath4 emission .",
    "moreover these authors also found a correlation between veiling and infrared excess implying a correlation between the presence of a dust disk and h@xmath4 emission strength .",
    "a similar result was found by hartmann ( 1998 ) who showed that stars with strong h@xmath4 emission in taurus tended to have large k - l infrared excess . in figure [ irac_vs_halpha ]",
    "we compare the h@xmath4 equivalent widths with the irac sed slopes of stars in the cluster .",
    "typically an equivalent width of 10 angstroms is taken to be indicative of the presence of accretion and stars with equivalent widths greater than this are designated as ctts ( classical t tauri stars ) .",
    "sources with smaller equivalent widths are designated as wtts ( weak - lined t tauri stars ) and are believed to be non - accreting objects or objects with very low accretion rates .",
    "this boundary between accretion and chromospheric emission is somewhat arbitrary and likely is not exactly appropriate for either very early or very late type stars .",
    "( for example , white and basri ( 2003 ) suggest that for stars between k0 and k5 the boundary should be near 3 angstroms ; only three of stars in our sample earlier than k7 have equivalent widths between 3 - 10 angstroms . )",
    "figure [ irac_vs_halpha ] shows a definite correlation between h@xmath4 equivalent width and sed slope .",
    "in particular sources with slopes @xmath78 indicative of optically thick circumstellar disks have the strongest emission lines . of the stars classified as ctts and actively accreting objects ,",
    "68% possess optically thick disks and 11% are associated with thin or anemic disks . of the stars classified as non - accreting wtts ,",
    "12% are associated with robust optically thick disks and 22% with thin disks .",
    "these data are not consistent with the notion that gaseous accretion disks exist for significant periods of time after the small dust emitting grains have gone away .",
    "this suggests that the gaseous and dust components of disks evolve on similar time scales .",
    "indeed , it appears more likely that dust disks can persist for at least some time after gaseous accretion has been terminated .",
    "we have combined _ spitzer  _ gto and existing ground - based , optical - infrared observations to obtain an accurate census and investigate the nature of the disk population of the young embedded cluster , ic  348 .",
    "we have constructed optical - infrared seds for all know members of the cluster spanning a spectral type range from a0 to m8 .",
    "this range includes stars at and somewhat below the hydrogen burning limit . from analysis of these results",
    "we summarize our primary findings as follows :    1)- from analysis of the optical - infrared seds of the cluster members we determine the fraction of disk - bearing stars to be 50 @xmath2 6% .",
    "however only 30 @xmath2 4% of the member stars are surrounded by robust , optically thick or primordial disks while 20% of the member stars are surrounded by optically thin or anemic disks .",
    "these measurements are lower than previous estimates for this cluster .",
    "these measurements suggest that in the 2 - 3 myr since the cluster formed , 70% of the stars have lost all or most of their primordial circumstellar disk material .",
    "2)- the disk fraction is a function of spectral type .",
    "the lowest disk frequency is found for early type stars .",
    "only 11 @xmath2 8% of stars earlier than k6 possess optically thick disks .",
    "the disk fraction peaks for stars of k6-m2 spectral types .",
    "these pms stars have masses similar to the sun and the fraction of such stars with robust , thick disks is 47 @xmath2 12%",
    ". for m2-m6 stars the overall disk fraction is found to decline to a value of 28 @xmath2 5% .",
    "thus it appears that disk longevity and the conditions for planet formation are most favorable around the solar mass stars in this cluster .",
    "3)- the optically thick disks around the lower mass , later type ( @xmath3 m4 ) stars in the cluster appear to be spatially flatter than those around the earlier type stars .",
    "this may indicate a greater degree of dust settling and more advanced evolution in the disks associated with the late m population .",
    "4)- a population of optically thin or anemic disks is identified .",
    "the fraction of stars accompanied by such disks ranges from 8 @xmath2 8% for early type stars to 26 @xmath2 5% for m type stars .",
    "however the fraction of disk - bearing stars with anemic disks is small for stars earlier than k6 , but is roughly 50% for m stars .",
    "these disks are almost exclusively detected at the longest wavelengths @xmath79 @xmath80 8 @xmath81  corresponding to the outermost disk regions probed by the _ spitzer  _ observations .",
    "we find that 37% of the anemic disk population is detected in the mips @xmath70  band . in a few cases",
    "the @xmath77  emission is as strong as that predicted for a flared , optically thick disk suggesting that dust emission from the outer disk may persist or even strengthen in spite of significant inner disk evolution and dissipation . however",
    ", for most anemic disk sources detected at 24 @xmath1 m , the data are consistent with the possibility that the inner and outer disk regions ( as traced by _ spitzer  _ ) evolve homologously and are more or less simultaneously depleted of dusty material as they age .",
    "5)- we find that the presence of an optically thick primordial disk is correlated with gaseous accretion as measured by h@xmath4 emission . a large fraction ( 68% ) of stars classified as ctts ( by their measured h@xmath4 equivalent widths )",
    "are surrounded by robust primordial disks .",
    "few such stars are diskless . on the other hand ,",
    "12% of the stars classified as wtts are associated with thick disks , while 64% appear to be diskless .",
    "this result suggests that active accretion and the evolution of the dust disks are strongly coupled .",

    "we know a priori that the observed spectral energy distributions of very young stellar objects probably do not correspond to those of typical main sequence dwarfs for three straightforward reasons : 1 ) very young pms star seds are distorted by the reradiation of stellar light by a circumstellar disk , 2 ) their seds can be distorted by rapid rotation and/or active chromospheres @xcite and 3 ) the large radii instrinsic to contracting pms stars requires that they have more giant - like surface gravities .",
    "empirically we know that the latest spectral classes correspond to subgiant gravities @xcite and display unusual optical colors @xcite . sorting out the shape of the spectral energy distribution of young stars requires a set of sources with refined photometry covering the optical and mid - ir and with excellent spectral types .",
    "the ensemble of data we have collected for ic  348 satisfies those requirements probably better than any other young stellar cluster or star forming region ; further , the _ spitzer  _ data presented here allows us to parse diskless stellar photospheres from disked stars with excellent precision .",
    "typical photospheric seds for ic  348 stars would provide a good starting place for detailed tests of model atmospheres .    another valuable reason for deriving the typical seds of ic  348 stars is to model the evolution of circumstellar disks .",

    "placing the typical seds from ic  348 into such a sequence may prove useful for refining both time and environmental variations in inner disk properties ; moreover , no other young cluster dataset probes a statistically significant population of sources down to and below the hydrogen burning limit as we have collected for ic  348 .",
    "given our goal of providing median seds that correspond to the typical observed star or star / disk system in the 2 - 3 myr ic  348 cluster , we present in figure [ med_seds ] median spectral energy distributions for diskless stars in ic  348 , members with anemic disks and members with thick disks , while breaking the ensemble population into ten spectral type bins .",

    "<S> the observations are sufficiently sensitive to enable the first detailed measurement of the disk frequency for very low mass stars at the peak of the stellar imf . using measurements of infrared excess between 3.6 and 8 @xmath1 m we find the total frequency of disk - bearing stars in the cluster to be 50 @xmath2 6% . </S>",

    "<S> both these values are below previous estimates for this cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the disk fraction appears to be a function of spectral type and stellar mass . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of stars with optically thick disks ranges from 11 @xmath2 8% for stars earlier than k6 , to 47 @xmath2 12% for k6-m2 stars to 28 @xmath2 5% for m2 - m6 stars . the disk longevity and thus conditions for planet formation appear to be most favorable for the k6-m2 stars which are objects of comparable mass to the sun for the age of this cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the optically thick disks around later type ( @xmath3 m4 ) stars appear to be less flared than the disks around earlier type stars . </S>",
    "<S> this may indicate a greater degree of dust settling and a more advanced evolutionary state for the late m disk population . </S>",
    "<S> finally we find that the presence of an optically thick dust disk is correlated with gaseous accretion as measured by the strength of h@xmath4 emission . </S>",
    "<S> a large fraction of stars classified as ctts possess robust , optically thick disks and very few of such stars are found to be diskless . the majority ( 64% ) of stars classified as wtts </S>",
    "<S> are found to be diskless . </S>",
    "<S> however , a significant fraction ( 12% ) of these stars are found to be surrounded by thick , primordial disks . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that it is more likely for dust disks to persist in the absence of active gaseous accretion than for active accretion to persist in the absence of dusty disks . </S>"
