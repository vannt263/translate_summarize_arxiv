    "interplanetary dust interior to the solar system s asteroid belt is called the zodiacal dust , which comes from comet comae and asteroid collisions , just like the dust in any debris disk .",
    "at least 16% of nearby solar - type stars harbor cold , outer debris dust much denser than the dust in the solar system s kuiper belt @xcite .",
    "sensitive new far - ir surveys probing similar stars for cold dust down to about 10 times the solar system kuiper belt level find a detection rate of @xmath0 ( eiroa et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "unfortunately , we know little about warmer exozodiacal dust ( exozodi ) in the inner reaches of nearby systems , i.e.  within the stars habitable zones .",
    "about 1% of nearby solar - type stars show a large amount of emission from warm dust ( @xmath1 times the expected zodiacal dust emission in the wavelength range from 8.5  @xmath2 m  to 12  @xmath2 m ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , a more sensitive survey for exozodiacal dust around a smaller set of nearby stars with the keck nulling interferometer ( kin ) found mostly non - detections ( discussed further below ; * ? ? ?",
    "as will be shown , background flux from our local zodiacal dust and the exozodi will likely dominate the signal of an earth - analog exoplanet ( an exoearth , for short ) in direct images and spectra , even if exozodi levels are no greater than the solar system level .",
    "furthermore , debris disks often display dust structures , such as narrow rings ( e.g.  hr  4796a ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , clumps ( e.g.  @xmath3  eri ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and warps@xmath4inclined sub - disks ( e.g.  au  mic ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a notable example of a warped disk ",
    "the famous @xmath5  pictoris system  is shown in figure  [ fig : betapic ] .",
    "such structures are thought to be produced by the dynamical influence of a planet , as are the clumps of zodiacal dust leading and trailing the earth in its orbit @xcite .",
    "dust clumps are likely to be the most troublesome source of confusion in direct imaging of earth - size planets , since dynamical clumps orbit the star , though not necessarily with the same period as the perturbing planet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , exozodiacal dust complicates direct imaging of exoplanets in two ways : 1 ) as a source of noise and 2 ) as a source of confusion .",
    "the exozodical dust levels around nearby stars will be as important to the success of efforts to find and characterize earth - like exoplanets as the fraction of stars with potentially habitable planets ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "there is a strong need to sensitively probe nearby stars for small amounts of dust in their habitable zones . in this paper",
    ", we will first demonstrate the effect of exozodi emission as a source of increased noise in direct imaging of exoplanets , then assess the current knowledge of debris dust abundances and expected progress toward increasing our knowledge .",
    "debris disk observers typically express the amount of dust in a debris disk using the system s fractional dust luminosity , @xmath7 , which is the light absorbed by the dust and reemitted at thermal wavelengths ( infrared to millimeter ) relative to the stellar luminosity .",
    "this parameter , often also called the fractional infrared luminosity , is determined by integrating the total long - wavelength excess flux seen in a disk spectral energy distribution ( sed ) over frequency .",
    "therefore , it can be measured from unresolved photometry , more easily at long wavelengths where the stellar emission is relatively faint .",
    "@xmath7  is not a unit of optical depth , dust mass , or surface brightness . in the optically thin case ,",
    "it is proportional to the dust mass but is affected by grain properties like size and composition .    in the context of direct exoearth observations",
    ", the abundance of debris dust in habitable zones is typically given in units of `` zodis , '' which arose as a convenient way of quickly expressing some sort of ratio to the solar system zodiacal dust .",
    "however , extreme caution must be taken when interpreting the unit , since different workers have used different dust properties when constructing their one zodi .",
    "the definition adopted largely depended on what was useful or possible for the analysis at hand .",
    "for example , @xcite defined one zodi ( spelled `` zody '' ) as the effective emitting area of the solar system s zodiacal dust .",
    "@xcite took one zodi to be the fractional dust luminosity of the zodiacal dust ( @xmath7  @xmath8 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in order to relate the dust abundances of known debris disks to the solar system ( by this standard , @xmath5  pictoris has about 10,000 zodis of cold dust ) .",
    "others assume one zodi is a debris disk that is identical to the solar system s zodiacal dust in _ every respect _ , including total mass , spatial distribution , grain size distribution , albedo , scattering phase function , etc .",
    "( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ", we will refer to such a disk as a zodiacal - twin disk ; around a sun - twin star , we call it a solar system - twin disk and it has @xmath7  @xmath8 .",
    "however , care must be taken when applying a zodiacal - twin disk to a star different than the sun , since such a disk around another type of star may not be both self - consistent and truly identical to the zodiacal dust in every way .",
    "zodipic is a publicly available code frequently used to calculate zodiacal - twin disks for any type of star , using the zodiacal dust model in @xcite , which was itself based on fits to observations of the zodiacal dust emission with the cobe dirbe instrument .",
    "the code does not change the dust density distribution when varying the central star , as expected for a zodiacal - twin disk .",
    "however , the inner disk radius set by the dust sublimation temperature does move outward with increasing stellar luminosity , to prevent an unphysical situation with dust at impossibly high temperatures .",
    "the unfortunate consequence of this is that the total dust mass and @xmath7  value of a zodipic zodiacal - twin disk decreases as the stellar luminosity increases .    nonetheless , for direct observations of exoplanets at any wavelength , it is the surface brightness of the dust thermal or scattered emission near the location of the exoplanet that matters .",
    "while @xmath7  can be measured for debris disks , it is not straightforward to convert @xmath7  into a surface brightness ; one must assume the spatial distribution of the dust , as well as many other properties that are also typically unknown ( e.g.  albedo ) .",
    "but declaring one zodi to be a zodiacal - twin disk is also perilous . for most debris disks , we do not know if the inner dust matches the zodiacal dust and in some cases we know it can not ( e.g.  hd  69830 ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , this definition is typically applied to stars that are not identical to the sun without any adjustment to the radial dust distribution , which is not likely to provide an accurate comparison to the solar system ( discussed further below ) .",
    "because of these problems , we eschew use of the unit `` zodi '' in this paper , although we acknowledge its convenience and anticipate its continued usage .      in the next section of this paper ,",
    "we show the impact of exozodi emission on direct observations of exoearths at optical wavelengths . to do this",
    ", we need a reference value for the scattered light surface brightness . for a solar system - twin disk viewed at @xmath9 inclination ( the most likely value in a random distribution of inclinations ) , the modeled surface brightness at a projected separation of 1  au in the plane of the disk ( the quadrature position for a planet ) and @xmath10  @xmath2 m  is about @xmath11  mag  arcsec@xmath12 .",
    "other brightness values calculated with zodipic appear in table 1.b-1 of the tpf - c stdt final report .",
    "the inclination of the system strongly affects the observed surface brightness ; at 1  au , the surface brightness of a zodipic zodiacal - twin disk viewed edge - on is nearly 3  times greater than when viewed face - on .    to apply the above surface brightness value to another star , we take advantage of the fact that by definition the habitable zone is the region around a star where an earth - like planet receives the right amount of energy for it to have liquid water on its surface",
    "therefore , the habitable zone moves with changing stellar luminosity to keep the incident flux constant , such that @xmath13 where eeid stands for `` earth equivalent insolation distance . ''",
    "no matter the star , bodies in the habitable zone always receive about the same total amount of flux ; if their physical properties are the same , they also reflect or emit about the same total flux .",
    "one consequence of this is that the absolute bolometric magnitude of an earth - twin in the habitable zone does not change from star to star , assuming the same viewing geometry .",
    "another is that , assuming identical grain properties and inclination , the same amount of dust in the habitable zones of different stars has roughly the same surface brightness .",
    "therefore , we can reasonably adopt the surface brightness at 1  au of a solar system - twin disk viewed at @xmath9 inclination as a reference value for the exozodi brightness at the eeid for all stars .",
    "the movement of the habitable zone with stellar luminosity explains the aforementioned problem with applying an unmodified zodiacal - twin disk to stars that are not sun - like . for an earlier - type@xmath4later - type star",
    ", the eeid will be at a larger@xmath4smaller radius than 1  au , probing a more@xmath4less distant region of the zodiacal - twin disk where the surface density may not be the same ; in fact , the @xcite model says it should be lower@xmath4higher . if one was expecting the same amount of dust in the star s habitable zone as in the solar system s , the zodiacal - twin disk would need to be stretched@xmath4shrunk in radius by the square - root of the stellar luminosity .",
    "the importance of zodiacal and exozodiacal background emission is shown by comparing the counts from both sources to the counts from an exoearth .",
    "note that the following discussion applies to ordinary high - contrast imaging , such as would be performed with a coronagraph .",
    "the impact of exozodi on mid - ir nulling interferometers intended for direct exoearth observations ( e.g.  esa s darwin mission concept ) is extensively discussed in @xcite . following the approach in @xcite and assuming a uniform exozodi distribution near the planet location ,",
    "the counts ratio is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number of pixels in a critically sampled , diffraction - limited point - spread function ( psf ) from a partially obscured circular aperture ( @xmath16 ) ; @xmath17 is the angular area of a pixel at wavelength @xmath18 for a telescope of diameter @xmath19 ; @xmath20 is the surface brightness of the local zodiacal dust , which depends on the direction to the target star ( a generic value is @xmath21  mag  arcsec@xmath12 at @xmath10  @xmath2 m ) ; @xmath3 is the exozodi surface brightness at the eeid relative to the brightness of a solar system - twin disk ; @xmath22 is the surface brightness at the eeid ( 1  au ) of a solar system - twin disk viewed at @xmath9 inclination ( @xmath23  mag  arcsec@xmath12 for @xmath10  @xmath2 m ) ; @xmath24 is the absolute magnitude of the planet ( @xmath25  mag for an earth - twin orbiting at the eeid , viewed at quadrature ) ; and @xmath26 is the distance to the system in pc .",
    "the left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : impact ] shows the counts ratio versus exozodi brightness ( @xmath3 ) , assuming @xmath10  @xmath2 m , @xmath27  pc , the parameter values given above , and three different telescope diameters . for a 4-meter telescope ,",
    "the counts from the local zodiacal dust plus a solar system - twin disk of exozodi viewed at @xmath9 inclination are about 5  times greater than the counts from the earth at 10  pc .",
    "while this may sound disastrous , astronomers commonly observe targets that are fainter than the surrounding background , at the price of increased noise and longer exposure times . assuming background - limited imaging and including unsuppressed light from the central star , the time to detect an exoplanet at some @xmath28 in an image is @xmath29\\ ] ] where @xmath30  is the specific flux for zero magnitude in the image bandpass ( @xmath31 in @xmath32 band ) ; @xmath33  is the image bandpass width ; @xmath34  is the total facility throughput ; @xmath35 ; @xmath36  is the contrast level at the position of the exoplanet with respect to the theoretical airy peak of the stellar image ( @xmath37 for instruments designed for direct imaging of exoearths ) ; and @xmath38  is the stellar apparent magnitude ( for more details on the derivation of this equation , see * ? ? ?",
    "the terms within the square brackets of equation  [ eq : time ] account for the background sources : the first for local zodiacal dust , the second for exozodi , and the third for unsuppressed starlight .",
    "the third term is much smaller than the sum of the other two for all known mission concepts designed for direct exoearth observations at optical@xmath4near - ir wavelengths .",
    "this equation does not include any dark current or read noise , which are negligible compared to the other noise terms .",
    "the important points to take away are that in this idealized situation 1 )  the exposure time decreases as @xmath39  one factor of @xmath40 for the collecting area and another for the smaller psf leading to less background blended with the planet  and 2 )  the time increases linearly with increasing exozodi surface brightness .",
    "this is shown in the left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : impact ] , where the imaging time is also plotted for the three telescope diameters .",
    "the goal of a mission to obtain direct exoearths observations is to maximize the number of planets imaged and then characterized with spectra , while maintaining a reasonable mission architecture and lifetime .",
    "the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : impact ] shows how @xmath6 and the exozodi level combine to impact the performance of such a mission ( ignoring confusion ) .",
    "the plot was created using a simple mission planning code that chooses real stars within 30  pc of the sun for observation until the mission lifetime is reached ( the mission parameters and planning code are detailed in * ? ? ?",
    "it shows that the smaller @xmath6 is , the lower the exozodiacal dust level that can be tolerated while still obtaining direct observations of a sufficient number of exoplanets over the mission lifetime .",
    "the analysis in this section demonstrates the primary effect of exozodi on direct exoearth observations , i.e.  increased background noise and longer exposure times .",
    "however , equation  [ eq : time ] applies exactly only in the ideal case of uniform background emission and no systematic errors ( i.e.  no speckles ) .",
    "furthermore , the methods used to extract the exoplanet signal from the background will affect the @xmath28 achievable .",
    "if the background contains no unresolved structures , then matched filtering should be an efficient way of identifying point - sources like exoplanets ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however",
    ", since unresolved dust clumps and other background sources ( e.g.  stars and galaxies ) should often be present , this technique will not resolve all confusion issues .",
    "another option is to produce a model for the exozodi emission , fitting to portions of the exoplanet image , then subtract the model from the image .",
    "this should remove smoothly varying exozodi emission fairly easily . to account for unresolved dust clumps , more complex dynamical modeling of the whole system ( dust and exoplanets together )",
    "may be required .",
    "there are also observing strategies to mitigate sources of confusion ( e.g.  multi - epoch imaging , multi - color imaging , or even direct spectroscopy ) .",
    "but as of this writing , the problem of confusion for direct exoplanet imaging has not been thoroughly studied .",
    "now that we have established the importance of exozodi , we assess our knowledge of the debris dust levels around nearby solar - type stars . assuming the stellar spectrum is well - described by a rayleigh - jeans law ( as it typically is at mid - ir and longer wavelengths ) and the dust thermal emission is single - temperature blackbody radiation , the fractional dust luminosity",
    "may be expressed as @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the dust and stellar fluxes at some frequency @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the dust temperature , and @xmath46 is the stellar effective temperature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for blackbody grains , assuming all the dust is at the same temperature is equivalent to assuming that all the grains are at the same distance from the star ( i.e.  a ring - like disk ) .",
    "in reality , grains of different sizes will have different temperatures at the same distance .",
    "that being said , most debris disk seds are fairly well - described by either a cold ( @xmath47  tens of  k ) single - temperature blackbody  an outer dust ring  or the sum of a cold blackbody and a warmer one  outer and inner dust rings , an architecture reminiscent of the solar system s kuiper and asteroid belts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "for each instrument , the @xmath49 photometric uncertainty at the observation wavelength ( column  5 of table  [ tab : sens_data ] ) was converted into an uncertainty on the flux relative to the stellar flux at that wavelength ( @xmath50 in column  6 ) .",
    "we then replaced @xmath51 in equation  [ eq : lir ] with three times the relative flux uncertainties and plotted @xmath7 as a function of @xmath52 .",

    "emission from dust warmer@xmath4cooler than @xmath53 can be detected with reduced sensitivity .",
    "however , in most systems , emission from dust at temperatures near @xmath53 will swamp any emission from much warmer@xmath4cooler dust , which is why a survey for habitable zone dust is best done with an instrument that operates near 10  @xmath2 m .",

    "a recent kin exozodiacal dust survey found an average value of 0.4 for the fraction of dust emission transmitted through the fringes , assuming unmodified zodiacal - twin disks @xcite .",
    "the null leakage error must be divided by this transmission factor to give the correct uncertainty on the relative flux . however , the correct factor assuming a ring - like dust distribution , as we have done here , is not presently known and could be as large as 1 .",
