    "within the last few years it has become possible to undertake large surveys of galaxies at very large redshifts ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "simple photometric techniques keyed to the passage of the lyman break through broad - band filters allow efficient selection of high redshift galaxy candidates ( steidel , pettini & hamilton 1995 ; steidel _ et al . _  1996a , b ; madau _ et al . _",
    "1996 ) which can then be confirmed and studied thanks to the large spectroscopic throughput of the low resolution imaging spectrograph on the w.m .",

    "it is now feasible to study the large - scale distribution of star - forming galaxies at high redshift ( steidel _ et al . _  1998",
    "; giavalisco _ et al . _  1998",
    "; adelberger _",
    "et al . _",
    "1998 ) , and to obtain large enough samples of galaxies that accurate luminosity functions , color distributions , and the like for @xmath12 objects can be compiled ( e.g. , dickinson 1998 ; steidel _ et al . _",
    "the advantage of large and reasonably well defined samples is that they allow direct comparisons to the predictions of galaxy and structure formation models ( e.g. , baugh _ et al . _  1998",
    "; governato _ et al . _  1998",

    "; somerville , primack , & faber 1998 ; coles _ et al . _  1998",
    "; bagla 1998 ; jing & suto 1998 ) .    most of the work up to the present has concentrated on the redshift regime @xmath13 , for primarily practical reasons .",
    "these are the lowest redshifts at which the so - called `` lyman - break '' technique can be applied using ground - based photometry .",
    "also , at @xmath6 the spectroscopic features that are most useful for determining the redshifts of lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) fall within the wavelength range for which optical spectrographs are most efficient , and in which the night sky background is minimal . as discussed by steidel _",
    "et al . _  1998b ,",
    "while conceptually it is straightforward to extend the lyman - break technique to higher redshift ( one simply uses a filter system that is shifted to longer wavelengths ) , the spectroscopic confirmation of photometrically selected objects becomes far more difficult .",
    "the lyman - break technique has already been used in a very powerful way in the hubble deep field to estimate the star formation history of the universe in coarse redshift bins defined by galaxies lyman breaks passing through the f300w , f450w , and f606w filters ( madau _ et al . _  1996",
    "; madau , pozzetti , & dickinson 1998 , hereafter mpd ) .",
    "it has now become a major industry to place any observation of high redshift objects in the context of their implied contribution to the history of star formation , using the hubble deep field ( hdf ) observations as the basis for comparison at high redshifts ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "possibly one of the most important results from a series of papers by madau and others is the large apparent increase in ultraviolet luminosity density between redshift bins centered at @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which suggests a rapid increase in the co - moving volume - averaged rate of star formation over a rather short interval of cosmic time .",
    "this intriguing result appears to be consistent with what is observed for the space density of luminous , high redshift qsos ( e.g. schmidt _ et al . _  1995 ,",
    "kennefick _ et al . _  1995 ,",
    "shaver _ et al . _",
    "1998 ) , and implies that at @xmath17 one is entering the `` dark ages , '' the epoch when star formation was first turning on in galaxies .",
    "some other studies using photometric redshifts in the hdf , however , did not find evidence for such a clear change in the uv luminosity density over this redshift range ( e.g. sawicki _ et al . _  1997",
    "; pascarelle _ et al . _",
    "1999 ) .",
    "there are several reasons to be concerned about results based solely on the hubble deep field , however .",
    "first , the hdf , while clearly the highest quality image of the sky ever obtained , is after all only a very small piece of sky ( @xmath18 arcmin@xmath19 ) , and samples a relatively small volume at any redshift .",
    "since observations of the lyman - break galaxies at @xmath12 in ground - based surveys have shown that high redshift ( luminous ) star - forming galaxies are strongly clustered ( steidel _ et al . _  1998a ,",
    "giavalisco _ et al . _",
    "1998 , adelberger _",
    "et al . _",
    "1998 ) , one might be concerned about sample variance associated with a relatively small volume .",
    "moreover , even if the hdf provided a fair sample of the universe , the redshift distributions of f300w and f450w dropouts are not well known empirically . as a result , the effective volumes used by madau _",
    "et al . _  to calculate the star - formation densities at @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    "were based upon models of the spectral - energy distributions and lyman - continuum opacities of galaxies , and not on spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "we have found , in our large survey at @xmath6 , that the effective redshift selection function imposed by a particular set of photometric selection criteria is not a simple `` boxcar '' as assumed by madau _",
    "et al . _",
    "objects near the assumed boundaries of the @xmath22 function are under  represented due to photometric errors , and , more importantly , to the fact that there are substantial variations in the spectra of galaxies at a given redshift .",
    "these variations are due , among other things , to the stochastic nature of the line blanketing in the lyman @xmath23 forest , to the amount of intrinsic reddening by dust , and to whether lyman @xmath23 is in emission or absorption .",
    "while such subtleties may not seem important for the rather crude luminosity densities estimated from photometric redshifts , they undoubtedly have at least some effect on the implied luminosity densities , and the magnitude of this effect is difficult to estimate without spectroscopic redshifts .    in view of the importance of confirming the decline in the far - uv luminosity density between @xmath12 and @xmath5 , and the fact that we now have a substantial sample of galaxies in the redshift range @xmath24 from our relatively wide - angle ground - based surveys , we have undertaken to compile wide - field photometry and spectroscopic confirmation of lyman - break galaxies in a redshift interval @xmath0 .",
    "although comparatively low spatial resolution and significantly brighter backgrounds make it difficult to reach the depth of the hdf from the ground , it is feasible to to survey much larger fields ; our present survey aims to exploit this advantage .",
    "we have attempted to reach depths for @xmath5 lbgs that are comparable to our existing survey at @xmath6 , over a region @xmath8 times larger than the hdf .",
    "the @xmath25 survey has been based entirely on the custom @xmath26 filter system ( described in detail in steidel & hamilton 1993 ) , with effective wavelengths of 3650 , 4750 , and 6930  , respectively .",
    "it turns out to be remarkably efficient , for the purposes of selecting lyman - break galaxies at @xmath27 , to add one passband ( @xmath28 , with an effective wavelength of 8100  ) to our existing imaging data , and to select @xmath29-band dropouts using the @xmath30 system in a manner entirely analogous to the way we have used @xmath26 at @xmath12 .    in this paper",
    ", we present the initial results of our galaxy survey with an expected median redshift of @xmath31 , to demonstrate the feasibility of extending spectroscopic lyman - break galaxy surveys to higher redshifts , and to make a preliminary estimate of the star formation luminosity density for comparison to the analogous value at @xmath12 , all based on data that are independent of the hubble deep field .",
    "the photometric selection criteria , as for our @xmath12 sample , are based upon a combination of the expectations from modeling the spectral energy distributions of star - forming objects at high redshift , combined with practical considerations such as allowing for photometric errors , and steering away from regions in the @xmath32 color  color plane that are obviously contaminated with objects that are _ not _ at very high redshift ( i.e. , `` interlopers '' ) .",
    "our intention initially was to err on the side of caution and obtain redshifts for objects with a rather broad range of colors , since we did not know _ a priori _ where in the @xmath32 color  color plane the population of @xmath33 objects would lie .",
    "we defined the initial color selection criteria with the observed range of intrinsic @xmath12 galaxy colors in mind .",
    "as will be discussed elsewhere ( adelberger _ et al . _",
    "1999 ) , the colors of the galaxies in our @xmath34 sample are consistent with standard bruzual and charlot ( 1996 ) models of continuous star formation , altered by the statistical opacity of the igm ( following madau 1995 ) and a component of optically thick h  i in the galaxy itself , and reddened by applying a version of the starburst galaxy obscuration relation of calzetti ( 1997 ) extrapolated to wavelengths shorter than 1200  color of the models . ] the range of uv colors observed in the @xmath12 sample is well represented by such models with @xmath35 ranging from zero to @xmath360.3 magnitudes , with a median color ( which can be thought of as the spectrum of the `` typical '' lyman - break galaxy in the @xmath12 sample ) corresponding to @xmath37 for the adopted reddening curve ( note that this corresponds to an extinction at rest - frame @xmath38   [ the observed @xmath39 band ] of about a factor of 4 ) . all magnitudes and colors used in this paper are reported on the `` ab '' system ( oke & gunn 1983 ) .",
    "our @xmath32 photometric selection criteria were designed to select galaxies at @xmath5 with a range of intrinsic seds similar to what is observed in our @xmath26 sample at @xmath6 . in figure 1a , we have plotted the tracks in the @xmath32 color  color plane for the model spectra which closely match the observed galaxies at @xmath12 ; the same model galaxies are plotted in figure 1b to show their location relative to the color selection window used for the @xmath12 sample .",
    "there are two different color selection windows indicated in figure 1a .",
    "the shaded region is the one actually used to select objects for spectroscopic follow - up , which was intended to be relatively broad in order to explore the color ",
    "color space ( and the effects of photometric scatter ) somewhat ; the bold line encompasses the region which we will use as our primary selection window for comparison with the @xmath12 data .",
    "the latter was adopted because it would result in comparable effective volumes near @xmath31 and @xmath40 in our two surveys if galaxies had the same range of intrinsic colors at these redshifts , and also because ( as we shall see below ) it turns out that one can eliminate a substantial fraction of the interlopers by keeping the @xmath41 colors relatively blue . this selection window is defined by @xmath42    the `` median color '' galaxy model ( the middle of the three color - color tracks shown in figure 1a ) enters the primary selection window at @xmath43 , and exits again at @xmath44 , so that this would be the _ a priori _ expected redshift range of a galaxy sample similar to the one observed at @xmath12 .",
    "this figure also shows that bluer ( i.e. , less reddened ) galaxies are expected to be biased somewhat toward the higher redshifts , and redder ( i.e. , more reddened ) ones toward the lower redshifts ; this is the main effect that makes the realized @xmath22 function different from a `` boxcar '' ( see , e.g. , steidel _ et al . _  1998b , and figure 4 ) . in figure 1a",
    "we have also plotted the color tracks for a template elliptical galaxy , with only k - corrections applied ( i.e. , no spectral evolution ) .",
    "note that the locus of unevolved early type galaxies comes very close to the selection window for the @xmath33 galaxies for @xmath45 .",
    "a combination of photometric errors and intrinsic variations in galaxy spectral - energy distributions can scatter some early - type galaxies at these redshifts into our selection window .",
    "it turns out that such objects are the sole source of `` interlopers '' for the @xmath27 sample , and we suggest below ways that their contribution can be minimized . note also that no contamination by stars is expected ( unlike in the @xmath12 sample  see figure 1b ) .",
    "with the exception of dsf1550 , all of the fields included here have been part of our extensive survey for @xmath12 galaxies ; the field centers are given in table 1 .",
    "the imaging data were obtained at the william herschel telescope ( 3c 324 and b2 0902 + 34 ) , palomar 200-inch hale telescope ( cdfa , cdfb , dsf2237a , dsf2237b , ssa22a , ssa22b , and b2 0902 + 34 ) , and the ctio 4 m telescope ( dsf1550 + 08 ) during the interval 1996 - 98 .",
    "all of the imaging data and the photometric methods employed will be presented in detail elsewhere ; in brief , the photometry was performed in a manner identical to that used for the @xmath46 galaxy searches , which is described ( for example ) in steidel , pettini , & hamilton ( 1995 ) , with the exception that we have used a modified version of the focas ( valdes 1982 ) image detection and analysis routines that one of us ( kla ) has optimized for our purposes .    for fields in which existing @xmath26 catalogs were already on hand , we simply registered the @xmath28 image onto the same coordinate system and obtained the @xmath28 magnitudes and @xmath41 colors through the same matched apertures .",
    "we have performed our object detection on the @xmath39 band images because they are in most cases significantly deeper than in the @xmath28 band .",
    "however , the selection of candidate @xmath33 galaxies has been made using the @xmath28 band total magnitudes .",
    "( this procedure is unlikely to present any significant biases , given that the expected colors are quite blue in @xmath41 , and our @xmath39 images typically reach @xmath47 magnitudes deeper than the @xmath28 images ) .",
    "the typical depths of our images , in @xmath48seeing , are 29.3 , 28.5 , and 28.0 magnitudes per square arc second for @xmath29 , @xmath39 , and @xmath28 , respectively , within a 1  aperture ( 1 @xmath49 ) .",
    "thus , an object with @xmath50 is approximately a @xmath51 detection in the @xmath28 band , with considerable dynamic range available to measure colors in the @xmath29 and @xmath39 bands .",
    "we have chosen to limit the object catalogs to @xmath52 in order to provide a relatively high level of photometric completeness and ensure that there would be sufficient dynamic range to detect breaks in the @xmath53 colors .",
    "we will discuss completeness issues in  4 below .",
    "the photometric selection criteria summarized in figure 1a ( shaded region ) were used to isolate candidates for @xmath27 objects .",
    "all such candidates were examined visually in order to remove objects that were clearly spurious ( these usually were found near very bright stars ) .",
    "a summary of the number of remaining candidates in each field is given in table 1 .",
    "a composite 2-color diagram from the 10 fields included in this paper is shown in figure 2 .      all of the galaxy spectra were obtained using the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( oke _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) on the keck ii 10 m telescope , between 1997 march and 1998 october . for the observing runs in 1997",
    ", we generally included several slits targeting @xmath33 candidates on masks designed primarily for our @xmath12 lbg survey ; as a consequence , most of these spectra were obtained using the 300 line / mm grating blazed at 5000    and with a grating tilt optimized for the 40007000   range . a more efficient configuration , with better sensitivity in the crucial 6000 - 7500   range , was to use a 150 line / mm grating blazed at 7500 ; this was used in the 1998 observing runs and increased the spectroscopic success rate by about a factor of 23 for both @xmath5 galaxies and lower redshift interlopers ( e.g. ,",
    "a single slit mask , with 16 candidate objects , yielded 7 successful redshifts in the @xmath54 and one @xmath55 interloper in the dsf1550 field in 1998 may  the remaining 8 candidates had inadequate s / n for identification ) . slit widths on the masks were either 10 or 14 , resulting in spectral resolution ranging from 10 - 12  for the 300 line configuration and 20 - 25  for the 150 line configuration .",
    "typical total exposure times per mask were 2 hours , usually broken into individual exposures of 1200 or 1800s , with small dithers along the slitlets between exposures in order to sample different parts of the detector and to allow the option of various schemes for the removal of fringes at redder wavelengths .",
    "the data were reduced using a suite of custom iraf scripts .",
    "examples of @xmath5 galaxy spectra are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the onset of strong lyman @xmath23 forest blanketing is very apparent in the spectra of these galaxies . as in the @xmath12 sample",
    ", there is a wide variety of spectroscopic properties , ranging from lyman @xmath23 in emission with rest - frame equivalent widths up to @xmath56  , to objects with very strong lyman @xmath23 absorption and accompanying strong lines of various interstellar transitions of low ions , to objects that have lyman @xmath23 in both absorption and in emission ( see , e.g. , the spectrum of hdf g4 in figure 3 ) .",
    "there is an obvious spectroscopic bias against objects that do not have strong emission lines , but even with this bias about half of our successful redshifts are based purely on absorption features .",
    "the substantial fraction of absorption - dominated spectra in our @xmath5 sample may be due in part to the large intrinsic luminosities of the galaxies ; we see some evidence in our @xmath6 sample , which reaches fainter intrinsic luminosities , that brighter objects tend to have absorption - dominated spectra .",
    "these effects will will be quantified elsewhere .",
    "unsuccessful redshifts were invariably due to lack of adequate s / n .",
    "this is a more serious problem at @xmath5 than at @xmath6 , largely because the spectral features used to identify redshifts are moved from 45006000   to 65007500  , where the sky is 1.52 magnitudes brighter . as a result",
    "our success rate for identifying redshifts is @xmath363050% at @xmath5 , compared to @xmath57% at @xmath6",
    ". objects with strong lyman @xmath23 emission lines are clearly less likely to fall into the `` unsuccessful '' category , as the continuum s / n is much less important than for the absorption line objects , and for this reason it is likely that most of the spectra which remain to be identified do not have lyman @xmath23 emission with large equivalent width . in the range of continuum luminosity that we are currently probing",
    ", even very sensitive narrow - band searches would turn up only a relatively small fraction of the galaxies ( cf .",
    "et al . _",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the magnitudes , colors , and redshifts of all 48 of the spectroscopically confirmed @xmath17 galaxies are summarized in table 2 .",
    "also summarized are the same quantities for the galaxies identified as interlopers ; all 73 of the objects with redshifts are indicated with shaded `` dots '' on figure 2 . from figure 2 , it is clear that most of the objects in the selection window with red @xmath41 colors are interlopers .",
    "as mentioned above , by tightening the color selection window to include only objects having @xmath58 , one immediately eliminates 11 of the 25 interlopers , most of which have @xmath59 , as expected from figure 1a ; only 2 out of 48 of the bona fide high redshift galaxies are excluded , is the most intrinsically luminous lyman break galaxy in our entire sample of more than 700 at @xmath60 .",
    "the relatively red @xmath41 color in this case is due to significant blanketing of the @xmath39 passband by the lyman alpha forest . ] .",
    "in addition , applying the requirement that the galaxies must have @xmath61 ( this will tend to screen out @xmath62 early type galaxies , which will typically have @xmath63 ) eliminates an additional 2 interlopers in the spectroscopic sample , and has no effect on the true high redshift sample for objects with redshifts .",
    "thus , with this adjustment of the color selection criteria ( which one would have chosen in any case in order to observe the same types of galaxies seen in the @xmath12 sample , as demonstrated in figure 1 ) , the contamination of the spectroscopic sample can be reduced from 25/73 to 12/60 , with the loss of only 2 true high redshift galaxies . as can be seen from table 1 , applying the new color cut",
    "reduces the number of candidates from 244 to 207 .",
    "we regard this sample of 207 candidates as our primary photometric sample without the cut , and @xmath64 , or a difference of much less than 1 @xmath49 ) ] , and the estimated contamination by interlopers is @xmath65 .",
    "the observed surface density of @xmath33 galaxies to a limit of @xmath67 , @xmath68 arcmin@xmath69 , is significantly smaller than the observed surface density of @xmath12 galaxies to @xmath70 , @xmath71 arcmin@xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath28 band samples the far  uv continuum of @xmath5 galaxies at very similar rest wavelengths as the @xmath39 band at @xmath46 ( by design ) , so that k - corrections between the two should be negligible ; however , obviously one is sampling different parts of the luminosity function because of the larger luminosity distance for the @xmath33 sample .",
    "our approach for comparing the two samples will be to truncate the @xmath6 sample at an apparent @xmath39 magnitude that corresponds to an absolute far  uv flux density equivalent to @xmath67 at @xmath72 ( the median redshift of the @xmath33 sample ) .",
    "this apparent magnitude is cosmology dependent : @xmath73 for einstein - de sitter , @xmath74 for @xmath75 open , and @xmath76 for @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "the first step is to correct the samples for contamination by interlopers .",
    "the @xmath33 surface density was statistically corrected for contamination based on the spectroscopic results , as described above . at @xmath12 , the only known interlopers ( other than qsos , which we have also removed from the sample ) are galactic stars , which we have found empirically to have a surface density to @xmath79 along the sightlines we sample of @xmath80 arc min@xmath69 ( and essentially zero at fainter apparent magnitudes ) .",
    "thus , both samples have comparable contamination by interlopers , and both interloper populations ( stars and early type galaxies ) tend to populate the bright end of the apparent magnitude distribution ; all corrections for contamination have been made as a function of apparent magnitude .",
    "once interlopers have been removed from the samples , we can begin to estimate the comoving luminosity density at @xmath6 and @xmath5 from the observed surface density of @xmath81 and @xmath29 dropouts .",
    "the main complication is that some fraction of the galaxies brighter than our magnitude limits at these redshifts are undoubtedly missing from our sample because of photometric errors , blending with foreground objects , and  more seriously  because they may have intrinsic colors which do not match our selection criteria .",
    "in order to investigate this incompleteness quantitatively , we have run monte - carlo simulations in which large numbers of artificial objects with a range of colors and magnitudes are added to our real images , and then recovered using the same methods employed for the real photometry .",
    "the complete results of these simulations will be presented in adelberger _",
    "et al . _  ( 1999 , a99 ) ; but for the present they are useful mainly because they yield an estimate of the effective volume of our surveys as a function of apparent magnitude , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the probability a galaxy of apparent magnitude @xmath84 ( in @xmath39 at @xmath6 and @xmath28 at @xmath5 ) at redshift @xmath85 will be detected in our images and appear to match our photometric criteria , and @xmath86 is the comoving volume per arcmin@xmath87 at redshift @xmath85 . as shown in a99 , dividing the observed surface density of high redshift candidates by @xmath88 defined in this way compensates for our various selection biases and incompletenesses , and produces a maximum likelihood estimate of the comoving number density of galaxies with magnitude @xmath84 at the observed redshifts . the galaxy number density estimated with this procedure",
    "is corrected not only for the usual `` detection incompleteness '' due to the declining probability of detecting a galaxy in our images at the faintest magnitudes ( caused by both photometric errors and problems related to blending with foreground objects% , due mostly to blending effects . ] ) , but also for `` color incompleteness '' due to detected galaxies having measured colors that may erroneously place them outside of our color - selection window , and even to some extent for the `` template incompleteness '' which would arise if some fraction of high - redshift galaxies had true colors that lay outside of our color - selection window .",
    "this last correction is possible because our @xmath26 sample ( for example ) could contain galaxies at @xmath89 much redder than the typical color we assume , and galaxies at @xmath90 much bluer , and we can therefore use data from these redshifts to estimate the fraction of galaxies whose colors will not match our selection criteria at @xmath91 , where most of our sample lies .",
    "we will return to this below .",
    "the effective volumes calculated from our monte - carlo simulations are provided , as a function of apparent magnitude , in tables 3 and 4 .",
    "the incompleteness corrections implied by these effective volumes are significant , but because the corrections are comparable ( to within @xmath36 30% ) for the @xmath6 and @xmath5 samples , they do not strongly affect our estimate of the change in luminosity density over this range of redshift .",
    "very similar relative volumes at @xmath6 and @xmath5 would result , for example , from simply assuming a boxcar selection function with half - width given by the standard deviation ( see figure 4 ) of the redshifts in each sample .",
    "the incompleteness corrections are important when we attempt to derive absolute uv luminosity densities at @xmath6 and @xmath5 , but this calculation is subject to other , probably larger , uncertainties , as we discuss below .      from these effective volumes",
    "it is straightforward to compute luminosity functions from the observed surface density of @xmath81 and @xmath29 dropouts .",
    "it is of primary interest to compare the luminosity functions , and the integral luminosity densities , in the two redshift intervals .",
    "the most recent compilation from the hubble deep field data is that of madau , pozzetti , & dickinson ( 1998 , mpd ) , which suggests a factor of @xmath92 decline in the luminosity density between @xmath93 and @xmath33 ( the original madau _ et al . _",
    "1996 paper estimated the same decline at a factor of @xmath94 ) .",
    "in contrast we see little evidence in our ground - based sample for luminosity density evolution from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "figure 5 compares the @xmath81- and @xmath29-dropout luminosity functions for an einstein - de sitter cosmology .",
    "the agreement in both the shape and normalization of the bright end of the luminosity functions at @xmath12 and @xmath33 is quite striking , and depends only mildly on cosmology ( the other 2 cosmologies considered make the @xmath33 luminosity function slightly brighter relative to that at @xmath12 ) . to construct this plot from the comoving number density of objects with apparent magnitude @xmath95 , which we estimated above , we used the relationship @xmath96 and adopted ( for simplicity ) @xmath97 luminosity distances of @xmath98 cm for all objects in our @xmath6 sample , and @xmath99 cm for all objects in our @xmath5 sample .",
    "these luminosity distances are appropriate for objects at the median observed redshifts of @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the corresponding luminosity distances for @xmath102 open and @xmath103 flat are @xmath104 cm at @xmath100 and @xmath105 cm at @xmath106 .",
    "the results of integrating the luminosity distributions over the same range of intrinsic luminosity ( the smallest luminosity corresponds to the faintest objects in the @xmath33 sample , which is @xmath67 , or @xmath107 for the einstein - de sitter model @xmath108 km  s@xmath109mpc@xmath109 [ see figure 5 ] ) , as well as the ratios of the luminosity densities in the two redshift intervals , are given in table 5 . in assigning errors to these luminosity densities ,",
    "we have attempted to account for poisson counting statistics , uncertainties in the contamination corrections , and for systematic uncertainties in the effective volumes discussed above .    for all cosmologies",
    "we consider , the observed uv - luminosity density integrated to the luminosity equivalent of @xmath110 at @xmath72 shows no significant change between @xmath3 and @xmath111 , in apparent conflict with several analyses based upon the hdf alone ( e.g. madau _ et al .",

    "the number of @xmath122 dropouts in the hdf was taken from the catalog of dickinson ( 1998 ) ; the @xmath123 dropouts are from table 3 of madau _ et al . _  ( 1996 ) .",
    "the @xmath122 dropout points fall rather nicely along the schechter ( 1976 ) function with faint - end slope @xmath132 defined by the ground - based sample alone , but this is likely at least partly fortuitous : removing the @xmath133 criterion from our @xmath122 dropout definition would have changed our estimated effective volume by only 14% , but would have increased the number of @xmath122 dropouts by about 45% and significantly altered the luminosity function shape .",
    "the large number of dropouts excluded by the @xmath133 criterion have colors similar to those expected for galaxies at @xmath134 , suggesting that a significant fraction of the @xmath122 dropouts in the hdf may be associated with a single galaxy over - density at @xmath135 .",
    "this would not be completely unexpected ; even in one of our much larger ground - based fields , `` ssa22a , '' almost half of the @xmath81 dropouts lie within the narrow redshift interval @xmath136 ( steidel _ et al . _",
    "regardless of the exact cause of these changes , it appears that seemingly minor adjustments to color - selection criteria in the hdf can have serious effects on the normalization and shape of derived luminosity functions , and this illustrates that caution is required in interpreting the results from a single small field as universal .",
    "measuring consistent luminosity functions in several fields spread over the sky would provide some assurance that the derived luminosity densities may be close to their universal values , but currently this is possible only at the relatively shallow depths reached in ground - based samples .",
    "nevertheless , we have fit a schechter ( 1976 ) function to the combined hdf + ground - based luminosity function shown in figure 8 , after excluding the faintest hdf point which may suffer from incompleteness , and we find , with formal 68.3% confidence , that @xmath137 and @xmath138 . the fit is determined largely by the ground - based data , and so our confidence in it is not entirely eroded by our reservations about the hdf .",
    "this estimate of the faint - end slope @xmath23 is considerably steeper than previous estimates ( e.g. dickinson 1998 , pozzetti _ et al . _  1998 ) .",
    "at @xmath5 it is more difficult to gauge the consistency between the ground - based data and the hdf , because there is very little luminosity overlap between the two samples ; only a single @xmath123 dropout in the hdf would have been bright enough to be included in our ground - based sample",
    ". a naive fit to the points in the bottom panel of figure 8 would favor a faint - end slope of @xmath139 , but because of our concerns about sample variance in the hdf , we have chosen to plot ( instead of an actual fit ) our @xmath6 luminosity function redshifted to @xmath5 in an @xmath128 cosmology ( i.e. , with @xmath140 shifted by the relative distance modulus between @xmath141 and @xmath72 ) , and multiplied by 0.8 ( cf .",

    "this matches our @xmath33 data well at the bright end , but over - predicts the number of fainter hdf @xmath123-dropouts by about a factor of two , and the integrated luminosity density by about a factor of 2.5 ( see the discussion in  5.1 ) . a combination of deeper ground - based data and the hdf - south should help decide whether the disagreement of the hdf @xmath123 dropouts at the faint end truly signals a different luminosity function shape at @xmath5 , or is a further indication that the hdf does not provide a fair sample of the universe .",
    "figure 8 contains most of the available information on the star - formation density at @xmath6 and @xmath5 , and we have used it as a basis for re - evaluating the star - formation history of the universe derived previously by many authors , most famously madau _",
    "et al . _  ( 1996 ) .",
    "our result is shown in the top panel of figure 9 .",
    "for consistency we estimated the star - formation density of the universe at all redshifts by integrating luminosity functions down to @xmath142 , which corresponds roughly to @xmath143 , our faintest data point , at @xmath6 .",
    "as discussed above , the luminosity functions at @xmath6 and ( especially ) @xmath5 have not been convincingly measured down to @xmath142 , and this is one of the many large uncertainties that underlie a diagram such as figure 9 . at @xmath6",
    "we adopted the @xmath144 , @xmath145 schechter - function fit derived above for the luminosity function .",
    "at @xmath5 we used the luminosity function form shown in the bottom panel of figure 8 ; as discussed above , this luminosity function agrees well with the @xmath5 data at the bright end , but is apparently inconsistent at the faint end with the small number ( 13 ) of @xmath123 dropouts in the hdf .",
    "the estimate of the star - formation density at @xmath59 relies upon luminosity functions at lower redshifts in a similar way : because the high - redshift cfrs data do not extend fainter than @xmath146 , the faint - end slope from lower redshift points was assumed in calculating the integral luminosity density at @xmath59 .",
    "the ground - based point at @xmath12 is in very good agreement with that from mpd based solely on the hdf , because the new effective volume is similar to that assumed in the past , but we find no evidence for a sharp decline at any redshift larger than @xmath59 .",
    "if we were to integrate the luminosity functions over all luminosities instead of over @xmath147 , the total luminosity density for our @xmath6 and @xmath5 points would be increased by an additional factor of @xmath148 , whereas the @xmath149 points would increase by only @xmath150% .",
    "this is due to the different faint - end slopes ( @xmath145 and @xmath151 ) that we have assumed at @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "it is clear that the real uncertainties in the absolute placement of any of the points in figure 9 are much larger than the error bars would indicate when uncertainty in the shape of the luminosity function at unobserved magnitudes is taken into account .",
    "the star - formation densities we have calculated so far assume that the far - uv continua of lyman - break galaxies have not been extinguished by dust , but of course the observed colors of these galaxies suggest that this is unlikely to be the case . in principle we could correct each galaxy s magnitude for dust extinction based upon its implied @xmath35 , construct new luminosity functions at @xmath6 and @xmath5 , and then integrate these to obtain dust - corrected star formation densities .",
    "unfortunately it is difficult to estimate @xmath35 for galaxies in our @xmath5 sample , because the @xmath39 and @xmath28 filters do not provide a long enough wavelength baseline , and in any case the @xmath5 spectroscopic sample is still rather small . for simplicity",
    "we have instead corrected our @xmath6 and @xmath5 star - formation densities for extinction by multiplying each by a factor of 4.7 , appropriate for the calzetti ( 1997 ) reddening law with typical @xmath154 ( cf .",
    "figure 6 ) .",
    "this correction is reasonably well justified for the @xmath6 sample , where we know the distribution of @xmath35 .",
    "its justification at @xmath5 depends upon the assumptions that dust properties are the same at @xmath6 and @xmath5 and that galaxies have the same underlying seds ; these assumptions are at least consistent with the limited data , as ( for example ) figure 4 shows .",
    "the extinction - corrected luminosity densities are shown in the bottom panel of figure 9 . in this figure",
    "we have also applied reddening corrections to the points at other redshifts . for internal consistency",
    "we assumed the same mean @xmath155 and calzetti extinction law for galaxies in other samples , so that differences in extinction corrections depend only on the different rest wavelengths probed at different redshifts . under these assumption ,",
    "the ratio of extinction corrections at @xmath156 and @xmath157 is set by the ratio of the effective extinction at @xmath158  to that at 2800  , or a factor of approximately 1.7 , implying a multiplicative correction to the @xmath157 points of 2.7 .",
    "the implied correction at @xmath159 is consistent with the corrections deduced by glazebrook _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) from h@xmath23 spectroscopy of galaxies from the canada - france redshift survey sample , as are the corrections implied at @xmath160 in comparison to the results of tresse & maddox ( 1998 ) .    because the faint ends of luminosity functions have not been well established at high redshifts , and the uncertainties in dust extinction are large at all redshifts , it is probably safest not to read very much into figure 9 .",
    "the point is that there is little compelling evidence , in view of the uncertainties involved , for the `` peak '' in universal star formation density at @xmath161 that has been assumed by many authors .",
    "the precise relationships between the star - formation densities estimated with various techniques ( e.g. uv continua , h@xmath23 , sub - millimeter ) are ambiguous because of the uncertainties in both relative normalization and in quantitative interpretation ( see , e.g. , kennicutt 1998 ) . on the other hand , the consistency of the method we have used to quantify the uv luminosities being produced by star formation at @xmath12 and @xmath5 , coupled with more secure knowledge of the relevant volumes being probed because of the extensive spectroscopic sub - samples , allows for a much more robust differential determination than has been possible up to this time .",
    "while we still regard our result as tentative because of the relatively small size of the @xmath5 spectroscopic sample , it should serve as a caution against reaching premature conclusions about the extent to which the universal star formation history is understood .",
    "there is not strictly speaking any conflict between the results we have presented and analyses based solely on the hubble deep field ( e.g. madau _ et al . _",
    "1996 , mpd , etc . ) .",
    "our ground - based data are consistent with hdf at both @xmath6 and @xmath5 in the range of apparent magnitudes that overlap , although this range is very small at @xmath5 .",
    "the hdf provides the only data on fainter lbgs at these redshifts . in ",
    "4.3 we re - analyzed the hdf using improved estimates of the intrinsic spectral - energy distributions of high - redshift galaxies , and we found , like previous authors , that the co - moving luminosity density of faint lbgs in the hdf appears to be roughly 2 times lower at @xmath5 than @xmath6 . this may indicate that the shape of the luminosity function changes significantly between redshifts @xmath5 and @xmath6sawicki _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1997 ) reached this conclusion on somewhat different grounds  but the good agreement of the the @xmath6 and @xmath5 luminosity functions at the bright end , where they are the best determined , makes us suspect instead that the luminosity function may have the same shape at fainter magnitudes as well , and that the small number of @xmath123 dropouts is due to sample variance in the hdf .",
    "this would not be unexpected given the strong clustering that lbgs are known to exhibit .",
    "although the clustering strength of faint lbgs at @xmath5 is not likely to be measured in the near future , we can explore this hypothesis further by assuming that the hdf @xmath123-dropouts have the same clustering strength as brighter lbgs at @xmath6 .",
    "in our ground - based sample at @xmath6 , the variance of galaxy counts @xmath162 about the mean @xmath163 in random regions with angular size similar to the hdf is larger than the poisson variance @xmath164 by an amount @xmath165 with @xmath166 . because projection effects are comparable in the @xmath6 ground - based and @xmath5 hdf samples , a similar value of @xmath167 would hold for the hdf @xmath123-dropouts if they exhibited the same clustering as lbgs in our @xmath6 ground - based sample .",
    "if the @xmath168 luminosity function shown in the bottom panel of figure 8 were the correct lbg luminosity function at @xmath5 , one would expect an hdf - sized field ( @xmath18 arcmin@xmath19 ) to contain an average of about 23 @xmath123-dropouts with an rms of 7.5",
    ". the observed number of @xmath123-dropouts , 13 , is therefore inconsistent with this scenario at only the @xmath169 level .",
    "the formal level of inconsistency would be smaller still if we had taken proper account of other uncertainties ( e.g. effective volumes , incompleteness corrections , and so on ) in this crude calculation .",
    "the null hypothesis of identical luminosity function shapes at @xmath6 and @xmath5 can not be ruled out with much confidence .      in calculating the obscuration ",
    "corrected luminosity density as a function of redshift for the lbg samples as in figure 9 , we have implicitly assumed that the mean extinction corrections for the @xmath33 sample are the same as those at @xmath12 . while our lever arm for measuring the uv spectral energy distributions of the @xmath33 galaxies is not really adequate for independent assessment of their implied `` reddening '' , the assumption that the distribution of galaxy colors is the same at @xmath33 as observed at @xmath6 has yielded a predicted redshift distribution that is in good agreement with the information on @xmath22 at @xmath33 .",
    "measurements at longer wavelengths ( e.g. , j or possibly even z band ) of the @xmath170 galaxies and a larger spectroscopic sample will make this kind of assumption more secure . we have also shown that the typical inferred obscuration of @xmath12 galaxies is entirely consistent with obscuration estimates based on independent measurements at smaller redshifts ; for these reasons we regard it as a reasonable assumption that the mean obscuration at @xmath33 is not radically different from that at @xmath12 . a full discussion of the effects of obscuration on the normalization and shape of the far  uv luminosity function is deferred to another paper ( adelberger _ et al .",

    "many have remarked in retrospect that it would not be surprising if star formation density and agn number density followed similar histories , since the formation of galaxies capable of prodigious star formation and those able to develop massive central black holes are likely to be correlated to some extent ( e.g. , magorrian _ et al . _",
    "1998 ) . on the other hand , in light of the data presented here , it is probably not difficult to come up with reasons why they might not behave in precisely the same way , particularly at the highest redshifts ( c.f .",
    "haehnelt and rees 1993 ) .",

    "while it is not yet clear how much overlap there will be between luminous sub - millimeter sources and lyman - break galaxies , if there is any correlation with the bright end of the ( observed ) uv - selected galaxy luminosity function and potential sub - millimeter sources , then it might be expected that the luminosity density of sub - mm ( rest - frame far ir ) sources will remain high at @xmath33 . on the other hand , if the brightest sub - millimeter sources are related primarily to agn activity ( or , similarly , to the same physical processes that result in agn activity) the only published , positive identification of a high redshift sub - mm source indeed has an agn component ( ivison _ et al . _",
    "1998) then one might instead expect a peak in the @xmath173 range with a substantial decline at higher redshift . ultimately , differences in the redshift distributions of luminous uv and luminous far  ir sources could prove interesting ; however , a meaningful comparison between the scuba results and those presented here is not possible at present because , as we have shown , the luminosity densities require an accurate knowledge of the effective volume of a survey and also the luminosity distribution .",
    "neither is available for the scuba sources pending larger spectroscopic samples , no matter how elaborate a model one constructs .      in a comprehensive investigation of the universal star formation history and the implications and constraints provided by cosmic backgrounds at various wavelengths , mpd ( see also calzetti & heckman 1998 ) considered a number of different star formation histories , including one designed to mimic the traditional `` monolithic collapse '' . in this model",
    ", there is no decline in the luminosity density produced by star formation at @xmath9 , so that the star formation history looks similar to the extinction - corrected points in figure 9 . in order to reproduce the observed data for the uv luminosity density in the hdf ,",
    "it was necessary to add dust extinction whose importance was an increasing function of redshift . given the new data , as shown above , it is possible to accommodate a similar star formation history without requiring that the role played by dust change in any way as a function of redshift . as pointed out by mpd , because of the limited time involved at the highest redshifts , the only significant impact of having a larger amount of star formation at high redshift is to exceed the mean metallicity as expressed in the chemical abundances of high redshift damped lyman @xmath23 systems near @xmath12 .",
    "however , it may well be that the dlas do not , and in fact are not expected to , trace the same objects as appear to be producing the bulk of the high redshift stars and metals ( pettini _ et al . _  1999 ,",
    "somerville , primack , & faber 1998 , mo , mao , & white 1998 ) .",
    "once this constraint is removed , it appears that more high - redshift star formation is not in strong contradiction with any of the observable integrated backgrounds ( cf . calzetti & heckman 1998 ) .",
    "an interesting question is whether the observed constant star - formation density between redshifts 3 and 4 is consistent with hierarchical models for structure formation .",
    "an upper limit to the star - formation density at a given redshift is the rate at which gas can cool within the virialized objects at that redshift . if the lyman - break galaxies which we observe are associated with only the most massive virialized dark halos , as we have argued in adelberger _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) , then bremsstrahlung emission will likely be a major component of the cooling rate and supernova feedback will be nearly negligible . in this case , assuming self - similar gas distributions , the hot gas in an observed galaxy would lose energy at a rate @xmath174 .",
    "the hierarchical scaling relations @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 ( e.g. kaiser 1986 , navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) then imply @xmath178 . approximating the rate at which cold gas",
    "is produced , @xmath179 , as @xmath180 gives @xmath181 .",
    "we can estimate the ratio of typical galaxy masses in our @xmath182 and @xmath183 samples using the press - schechter ( 1974 ) model as described ( for example ) in adelberger _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) . for the @xmath184 power spectrum shape suggested by local measurements , the galaxies in our @xmath5 sample would have typical masses a factor of 3 , 1.3 , 2 times lower than galaxies of comparable abundance in our @xmath6 sample for @xmath185 , @xmath186 open , and @xmath187 flat .",
    "we would therefore expect our samples of galaxies at @xmath6 and @xmath5 to receive newly cooled gas at comparable rates ; using the expression above , we estimate that @xmath179 is about 1.2 , 0.9 , 0.7 times higher in @xmath6 sample than our @xmath5 sample  though it would be a mistake to take these numbers too seriously , as our estimate of @xmath179 is rather crude .",
    "perhaps a better estimate of the cooling rate is @xmath188 , proposed ( for @xmath185 ) by white & frenk ( 1991 ) , but this would not substantially alter our conclusion that comparable amounts of newly cooled gas are available in our @xmath6 and @xmath5 samples .",
    "the point is that two general characteristics of hierarchical models  objects which form at higher redshift are less massive and more dense than objects which form at lower redshift  have opposite effects on the rate at which gas cools in virialized objects , and , over the redshift interval @xmath5 to @xmath6 , these opposite effects largely cancel out under a range of plausible assumptions .",
    "this suggests that the observed constant star - formation density between @xmath5 and @xmath6 is by no means unexpected in hierarchical models  and indeed it was predicted as early as 1991 , long before the relevant observations were made , by white & frenk ( 1991 , fig .",
    "a separate question is whether the constant star - formation density is consistent with the prescriptions of semi - analytic models for turning cooled gas into stars .",
    "the arguments of the previous paragraph suggest that typical star formation rates in massive halos will need to scale moderately with halo dark mass @xmath189 and more strongly with redshift @xmath85 to successfully reproduce the constant star formation density we have observed .",
    "our uncertainty in the evolution of the star formation density from @xmath5 to @xmath6 is still rather large , and we will not press this argument further here ; but in principle it will be possible with observations such as these to empirically constrain the relationship between halo dark mass and star formation rate .",
    "this largely unconstrained relationship has proven in the past to be a fertile source of free parameters for semi - analytic models ; that may not be the case much longer .",
    "the very steep faint end slope ( @xmath145 ) of the current composite @xmath12 lbg luminosity function ( figure 8) , if taken at face value , suggests that a large fraction of the luminosity density at @xmath12 could be produced by objects that are beyond the detection limits for color - selected high redshift galaxies even in hubble deep field data .",
    "however , in the context of hierarchical galaxy formation models , if the star formation rates are related to the dark matter halo masses in a monotonic way ( cf .",
    "et al . _",
    "1998 ) , then at some point the luminosity function is expected to become much less steep than the mass function because of feed - back effects ( e.g. , cole _ et al . _",
    "for this reason , it would probably be incorrect to assume that the galaxy far  uv luminosity function could remain as steep as observed to arbitrarily faint magnitudes . the implications for galaxy formation models of the far  uv luminosity function and its evolution at high redshift will be explored in much more detail in adelberger _",
    "et al . _",
    "finally , the faint end slope we derive for the @xmath12 lbg luminosity function is very similar to that determined for far  uv selected galaxies at @xmath190 , @xmath191 ( treyer _ et al . _  1998 ) .    the current uncertainties in the observed uv luminosity function at @xmath27 ( and therefore the uncertainties in epoch - to - epoch comparisons )",
    "will certainly be reduced as more redshifts are obtained , and it is clearly interesting in light of the discussion above to probe fainter into the @xmath33 luminosity function with wide - angle surveys .",
    "more spectroscopy will allow more precise estimates of the effective volume imposed by a given set of color selection criteria , and will allow a better determination of the range of galaxy properties observed at a given redshift .",
    "there is of course the possibility of extending this type of survey to higher redshifts , as shown by recent successes in identifying galaxies at @xmath192 ( dey _ et al . _  1998",

    "the difficulty will come in gathering enough statistics to quantify the galaxy population at extreme redshifts , as one will be forced to still fainter apparent magnitudes ( in order to observe the same range of intrinsic luminosities ) and longer wavelengths for the follow - up spectroscopy , and the surface densities will begin to be so small that one will not be able to make optimum use of multi - object spectrographs on large telescopes .",
    "a concern is that galaxies without strong lyman @xmath23 emission at much higher redshifts are likely to be extraordinarily difficult to confirm spectroscopically . on the other hand , systematic searches for much higher redshift galaxies , and follow - up spectroscopy ,",
    "would be easily within reach with ir cameras and spectrographs on ngst .",
    "we have presented new photometric data covering 828 square arc minutes , and spectroscopic redshifts for 48 of the 244 candidates to @xmath110 , for lyman - break galaxies in the redshift range @xmath0 .",
    "these objects were selected using criteria that facilitate a direct comparison to the properties of the lyman - break galaxies in a larger sample covering the range @xmath4 . besides demonstrating the feasibility of assembling large samples of @xmath27 galaxies with ground - based imaging and spectroscopy ,",
    "we have reached the following principal conclusions :    \\1 .",
    "the spectroscopic properties of lbgs at @xmath27 are very similar to those of the brighter lbgs at @xmath6 .",
    "there is a wide range of spectroscopic properties , and the lyman @xmath23 line appears only in absorption for @xmath193 of the spectroscopically confirmed objects . we have used the results of the spectroscopy to fine - tune the @xmath5 color selection criteria to minimize contamination by lower redshift interlopers , and to maximize the completeness of the photometrically selected samples .",
    "we see no evidence in our ground - based samples for a significant change in either the shape or normalization of the lbg luminosity function between redshifts @xmath3 and @xmath171 . of our results , this is the one which depends upon the fewest assumptions .",
    "it holds for each of the cosmologies we consider ( @xmath128 , @xmath194 open , @xmath195 flat ) , and is largely independent of our newly estimated incompleteness corrections .",
    "if there is any large change in the uv - luminosity density between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , it must be due to objects too faint to be included in our ground - based sample .",
    "we agree with several previous authors that the hdf provides some evidence that these intrinsically faint lbgs are rarer at @xmath5 than @xmath6 , but the evidence is meager  there are only 13 @xmath123 dropouts in the hdf .",
    "we have shown that the expected sample variance for a volume the size of the hdf s renders the apparent deficit of @xmath196 galaxies statistically insignificant .",
    "we have developed a working model of the distribution of lbg colors which , when folded in with our color selection criteria and the observational uncertainties , successfully reproduces the observed colors as a function of redshift and the observed redshift distributions in the spectroscopic samples . within the context of this model ,",
    "the observed far - uv colors imply that a typical lbg suffers about 1.6 mag .",
    "of extinction at 1500  in the rest frame ( cf .",
    "et al . _",
    "1998 ) , with a range from zero extinction to @xmath197 magnitudes .",
    "if we apply an internally consistent extinction correction to the observed luminosity density points , and assume that dust plays an equal role at all redshifts , we find that the emissivity per unit co - moving volume due to star formation remains _ essentially flat _ for all redshift @xmath9 ; hence , it is not clear that the beginning of the epoch of star formation has yet been identified .",
    "we have presented a new composite @xmath6 far  uv luminosity function , based on a combination of data from our ground based survey and from a re - analysis of the hdf data based on our improved estimate of the survey effective volumes .",
    "the luminosity function at @xmath6 is well fit by a schechter function with a faint end slope of @xmath198 , considerably steeper than previous estimates . a similar fit results from using the ground - based sample alone .",
    "such a steep faint end slope allows for the possibility that a large fraction of the luminosity density at high redshift lies beyond even the detection limits in the hubble deep field .",
    "the lack of adequate constraints on the behavior of the lbg luminosity functions at faint magnitudes , particularly at @xmath27 , is an additional , possibly large , source of uncertainty in estimating the total luminosity density at high redshifts .",
    "the similarity of the ( observed ) @xmath33 and @xmath12 bright - end luminosity functions indicates a significant difference in the evolutionary behavior of universal star formation as compared to the space density of luminous agns .",
    "the apparent constancy of the uv luminosity function between @xmath12 and @xmath33 has interesting implications for the redshift distribution for the newly discovered population of luminous sub - millimeter sources , and for the star formation prescriptions in semi - analytic models of galaxy formation .",

    "<S> we present initial results of a survey for star - forming galaxies in the redshift range @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this sample consists of a photometric catalog of 244 galaxies culled from a total solid angle of 0.23 square degrees to an apparent magnitude of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopic redshifts in the range @xmath2 have been obtained for 48 of these galaxies ; their median redshift is @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> selecting these galaxies in a manner entirely analogous to our large survey for lyman break galaxies at smaller redshift ( @xmath4 ) allows a relatively clean differential comparison between the populations and integrated luminosity density at these two cosmic epochs . over the same range of uv luminosity , the spectroscopic properties of the galaxy samples at @xmath5 and @xmath6 are indistinguishable , as are the luminosity function shapes and the total integrated uv luminosity densities ( @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we see no evidence at these bright magnitudes for the steep decline in the star formation density inferred from fainter photometric lyman - break galaxies in the hubble deep field ( hdf ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hdf provides the only existing data on lyman - break galaxy number densities at fainter magnitudes . </S>",
    "<S> we have reanalyzed the @xmath6 and @xmath5 lyman - break galaxies in the hdf using our improved knowledge of the spectral energy distributions of these galaxies , and we find , like previous authors , that faint lyman - break galaxies appear to be rarer at @xmath5 than @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this might signal a large change in the faint - end slope of the lyman - break galaxy luminosity function between redshifts @xmath6 and @xmath5 , or , more likely , be due to significant variance in the number counts within the small volues probed by the hdf at high redshifts ( @xmath8 times smaller than the ground  based surveys discussed here ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the true luminosity density at @xmath5 is somewhat higher than implied by the hdf , as our ground - based sample suggests , then the emissivity of star formation as a function of redshift would appear essentially constant for all @xmath9 once internally consistent corrections for dust are made . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that there may be no obvious peak in star formation activity , and that the onset of substantial star formation in galaxies might occur at @xmath10 . </S>"
