    "these concepts , first laid out by @xcite , lead to the following three approaches :    ( 1 ) : :    detect radio emission like that from hlx-1 in its hard x - ray state ,    where hlx-1 is a strong imbh candidate in an extragalactic star    cluster with a stellar mass of @xmath10 @xcite .",

    "( 2 ) to be able to reach the regime of imbh masses , deeper x - ray and radio surveys that detect candidate clusters at lower luminosities are needed .",
    "importantly , the mass term in the fundamental plane implies that , in the hard - x - ray state , the radio emission from imbhs should be much brighter than that from stellar - mass bhs .",
    "this makes radio detections effective at filtering out contamination from the x - ray - emitting stellar - mass bhs often found in star clusters .",

    "owing to the large angular size of the galaxy , we used four pointing centers separated by 45 to provide relatively uniform sensitivity to the central regions of the galaxy .",
    "the pointing centers locations and observation dates appear in table 1 .",
    "each vla pointing was observed for one hour , giving 41 m of time on target , using a correlator integration time of 3 s. the target elevation lay between 23@xmath16 and 32@xmath16 in all cases .",
    "the observing bandwidth was split into two 1024-mhz basebands centred at 5.0 and 6.0 ghz , each comprised of eight spectral windows of width 128 mhz , each of which was split into sixty - four 2-mhz channels .",
    "we used 3c147 to set the amplitude scale to an estimated accuracy of about 3% , and j1048 + 7143 as the secondary calibrator to derive the atmospheric and instrumental complex gains on a per - antenna basis .",
    "the position assumed for j1048 + 7143 was @xmath17 and @xmath18 with one - dimensional errors at 1@xmath2 of 2 mas .",
    "given the observing strategies , the one - dimensional astrometric error at 1@xmath2 is estimated to be 01 .",

    "were imaged with the casa task clean using a robustness parameter of 0.5 to obtain the best compromise among sensitivity , spatial resolution and sidelobe suppression ; an nterms parameter of 2 to accommodate the large fractional bandwidth ; and the gridmode parameter set to `` widefield '' and the wprojplanes parameter set to 128 to correct for the effects of non - coplanar baselines .",
    "the images were dominated by the emission from the low - luminosity active galactic nucleus ( llagn ) in m81 , and required self - calibration , initially in phase , and then in amplitude and phase , down to a timescale as short as the correlator integration time of 3 s. the final , self - calibrated images of all four quadrants were restored with the same circular gaussian restoring beam of fwhm of 15 , and then mosaicked together , cutting off the response of the primary beam at the 10% level . in the mosaic , the llagn is point - like and has a flux density of 81@xmath133 mjy .",

    "figure 2 shows the vla cutouts for the 206 probable gcs .",
    "the 1@xmath2 rms noise level among the cutouts varies from 4.3 to 51  @xmath22jy  beam@xmath23 , a range expected given the primary beam cutoff invoked .",
    "an individual one - tail detection threshold of 3@xmath2 is adopted to minimize the risk of a false - positive detection of one or more targets when examining the ensembles of 206 probable gcs and 200 improbable gcs @xcite .",
    "only one of the 200 improbable gcs , i d 146 from @xcite , was detected with enough significance to serve as a crosscheck of the radio and optical astrometry .",
    "the vla cutout of i d 146 appears in figure 3 .",
    "the radio emission is somewhat resolved but dominantly compact .",
    "the radio peak has a total offset of @xmath24 when compared to the optical position reported by @xcite . assuming that the peaks should physcially coincide , such an offset is consistent with the error estimates cited above for the radio and optical data .",
    "moreover , finding resolved radio emission from i d 146 is consistent with its classification as an improbable gc : if it was a probable gc hosting an imbh in the low - hard state , any radio emission should be spatially unresolved .",
    "from figure 2 , none of the 206 probable gcs in m81 is detected above its local 3@xmath2 level at 5.5 ghz .",
    "the associated radio luminosities are @xmath25 erg s@xmath23 , using a definition that implicitly assumes a flat radio continuum spectrum up to 5.5 ghz .",
    "figure 4 conveys the radio luminosities and stellar masses of each of the 206 probable gcs . at these radio luminosities ,",
    "accreting stellar - mass compact objects in the hard x - ray state would have radio luminosities too faint to be detected @xcite .",
    "what about contamination from flaring radio emssion associated with a transition from the hard x - ray state to the soft x - ray state ?",
    "indeed , such flaring is thought to be the explanation for the stellar - mass bh in m31 that achieved a peak 5-ghz luminosity of @xmath26 erg s@xmath23 and then decayed on a timescale of days @xcite .",
    "however , the lack of radio detections in figure 4 implies that such flaring emission from stellar - mass bhs can not be a major contaminant for these single - epoch observations of the probable gcs in m81 .",
    "( stronger inferences about flares will be reported elsewhere in conjuction with radio monitoring observations . )",

    "[ motivation ] , namely analogs of hlx-1 (   [ hlx ] ) , x - ray detected clusters (   [ x - ray ] ) , and predictions of a semi - empirical model (   [ model ] ) . in the analysis to follow , it is important to keep in mind that only 40% of the probable gcs have been spectroscopically confirmed @xcite .",
    "hlx-1 is a strong imbh candidate , of mass @xmath27 , in an extragalactic star cluster with an observed stellar mass of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the host cluster s observed mass resembles those of the probable gcs in m81 , but the age of the host cluster s light - dominating stars , about 20 myr , is significantly younger than gcs , which are older than 10 gyr @xcite .",
    "still , the host cluster might be more massive and older than deduced so far , if it is actually the remnant of a stripped dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "as the latter authors note , such extra mass could also help retain the gas from which the younger stars formed .",
    "near 7 ghz hlx-1 can achieve a flaring luminosity of @xmath29 erg s@xmath23 during transits from its hard to soft x - ray states @xcite , and a steady luminosity of @xmath30 erg s@xmath23 while in its hard x - ray state @xcite . if that steady emission is doppler boosted by a factor of about five to ten , as @xcite argue , its side - on luminosity is about @xmath31 erg s@xmath23 .",
    "given these various radio luminosities for hlx-1 , figure 4 makes it clear that no hlx-1 analog resides in any of the 206 probable gcs in m81 .",
    "@xcite found the same result for 337 candidate gcs in ngc1023 and concluded that ( i ) hlx-1 is accreting gas related to the formation and/or presence of the 20-myr - old stars in its host cluster or ( ii ) the hlx-1 phenomenon is just so rare that no radio analog is expected in ngc1023 .",
    "the same two conclusions apply in the case of m81 .",
    "@xcite used extensive _",
    "chandra _ data to localize several hundred x - ray sources in m81 , and a. zezas ( 2015 , private communication ) is investigating their matches with probable gcs . in the interim , we used version 1.1 of the chandra source catalog @xcite to identify x - ray sources within the optical positional uncertainty of m81 s probable gcs .",
    "we also required that an x - ray detection had enough significance to establish a luminosity in the 0.5 - 10 kev band .",
    "this led to detections of @xcite ids 273 and 284 as sources cxoj095547.0 + 690551 and cxoj095549.7 + 690531 with luminosities of @xmath32 erg s@xmath23 and @xmath33 erg s@xmath23 , respectively .",
    "these detections are consistent with prior _ chandra _ results @xcite .",
    "importantly , @xcite noted that the two x - ray sources , detected in 16 or 17 observations , were always in a hard x - ray state , a requisite for applying the empirical fundamental - plane relation among the x - ray luminosity , @xmath34 , the radio luminosity , @xmath35 , and the bh mass , @xmath36 .",
    "as we wish to estimate masses , we employ the @xcite regression of the contracted sample of @xcite .",
    "inserting the above values for @xmath34 and figure 4 s upper limits to @xmath35 into that regression , we estimate bh masses at 95% confidence of @xmath37 for i d 273 and @xmath6 for i d 284 .",
    "the clusters stellar masses are known from figure 4 , and lead to estimates for the bh mass fractions of @xmath38 for i d 273 and @xmath39 for i d 284 .",
    "we comment further on these estimates in   [ model ] .",
    "as cautioned in   [ motivation ] , we can not rule out contamination from x - ray - emitting stellar - mass bhs . indeed , that is the more likely explanation because few imbhs are known , whereas many x - ray binaries are associated with extragalactic gcs .",
    "it is also noteworthy that no probable gc in m81 has an x - ray luminosity as high as that of hlx-1 in its hard state , @xmath40 erg s@xmath23 @xcite .",
    "this absence of an x - ray analog of hlx-1 is consistent with the absence of a radio analog of hlx-1 (   [ hlx ] ) .",
    "however , since our limits on the radio luminosity are over an order of magnitude lower than even a de - boosted version of hlx-1 , we are also able to rule out the presence of less extreme sources , even in the case where such a system was heavily absorbed and viewed edge - on , such that the x - ray emission would not be particularly remarkable .",
    "we adopt the semi - empirical model of @xcite to predict the mass of a putative imbh that , if experiencing hard - x - ray - state accretion in a gc , is consistent with the upper limit on the radio luminosity .",
    "following @xcite we conservatively assume that the imbh in a gc accretes at a fraction @xmath41 of the bondi rate from a medium with a gas density @xmath42 @xmath43 .",
    "such values yield a prediction for the hard - state x - ray luminosity @xmath34 .",
    "then , the empirical fundamental - plane regression for the @xcite contracted sample is employed to predict the associated radio luminosity @xmath35 . in this way , a detection of , or upper limit to , a radio luminosity maps to a detection of , or upper limit to , an imbh mass .",
    "figure 5 shows the results of applying this conservative , semi - emipirical model to the 206 probable gcs in m81 .",
    "the best radio luminosity constraint for an individual gc implies a 3@xmath2 imbh mass of @xmath44 . to reach a lower mass regime ,",
    "the aips task stack was used to form a weighted - mean image stack ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the cutouts of all 206 probable gcs .",
    "that stack , presented in figure 6 , measures the the mean contribution to the total radio emission from the probable gcs .",
    "for the all - cluster stack , the 3@xmath2 radio - luminosity upper limit corresponds to an imbh mass of @xmath45 .",
    "however , the gcs stellar masses , @xmath46 , range from about 10 thousand to 8 million solar masses , suggesting that it is physically more relevant to focus only on the more massive gcs . like @xcite ,",
    "we thus focus on the gcs whose putative imbhs have masses that are less than half the combined mass of their stars . the 49 gcs meeting that criterion",
    "are listed in table 2 and plotted with dark symbols in figure 5 .",
    "the column contents of table 2 are : column 1 , the i d from @xcite ; column 2 , the stellar mass based on the v - band ( f606w ) magnitudes from @xcite and that band s mass - to - light ratio for gcs from @xcite ; column 3 , the imbh mass based on the semi - empirical model ; and column 4 , the ratio of the imbh mass in column 3 to the stellar mass in column 2 .",
    "each of the 49 massive gcs in table 2 has a stellar mass @xmath47 .",
    "fully 13 of these massive gcs have upper limits to their bh mass fractions , @xmath48 , in the range @xmath49 .",
    "such upper limits are thus below the remarkable value of 0.15 reported for m60-ucd1 @xcite .",
    "the attributes of i d 273 in table 2 deserve special mention : applying the semi - empirical model leads to estimates of a bh mass of @xmath50 and a bh mass fraction of @xmath51 . for comparison ,",
    "applying the empirical fundamental plane , as in   [ x - ray ] , led to estimates of @xmath5 and @xmath38 .",
    "we also used the aips task stack to form a weighted - mean image stack of the cutouts of these 49 massive gcs .",
    "figure 7 shows that stack , a measure of the the mean contribution to the total radio emission from the 49 massive gcs .",
    "the stack s 3@xmath2 radio - luminosity upper limit corresponds to an imbh mass of @xmath52 for m81 , a stronger constraint than the upper limit of @xmath53 for ngc1023 @xcite .",
    "the mean stellar mass of the massive gcs in m81 is @xmath54 .",
    "taking the ratio of these values leads to a bh mass fraction @xmath55 for m81 , improving over the equivalent fraction of less than 0.16 for ngc1023 @xcite .",
    "the bh mass fraction of less than 0.08 for the massive gcs in m81 is well below the bh mass fraction of 0.15 for m60-ucd1 @xcite .",
    "still , it should be kept in mind that the interpretation of the bh mass fraction for m81 is affected by unknowns like the distribution function of imbh masses and the fraction of massive gcs occupied by an imbh .    within the context of this semi - empirical model , the vla constraints on individual gcs and stacks of gcs are beginning to probe the domain of imbhs in extragalactic gcs .",
    "these constraints for m81 can be improved with longer vla exposures or similar exposures with the next - generation vla ( ngvla ; * ? ? ? * ) . for perspective , assuming a sufficient dynamic range given m81 s llagn , a one - hour exposure with the ngvla at a frequency of 10 ghz could reach an rms noise of 0.45  @xmath22jy  beam@xmath23 for an individual gc .",
    "such an ngvla value would be very close to the rms noise achieved in figure 6 only after stacking the vla images of all 206 probable gcs in m81 .",
    "we used a four - pointing vla mosaic at 5.5 ghz to search for the radiative signatures of imbh accretion from 206 probable gcs in m81 , a spiral galaxy at a distance of 3.63 mpc .",
    "none of the individual gcs were detected .",
    "similarly , only upper limits were obtained from weighted - mean image stacks of all 206 gcs and of the 49 massive gcs with @xmath56 .",
    "we examined the implications of these data for imbhs , if any exist in these gcs .",
    "our principal findings are as follows :    1 .",
    "the 206 gcs in m81 lack radio analogs of hlx-1 , a strong imbh candidate in a star cluster in the early - type galaxy eso243 - 49 .",
    "this suggests that hlx-1 is accreting gas related to the 20-myr - old stars in its host cluster or that the hlx-1 phenomenon is so rare that no radio analog is expected in m81 .",
    "two gcs exhibit hard - state x - ray emission . from the empirical fundamental - plane relation ,",
    "their x - ray and radio luminosities suggest individual imbh masses , @xmath36 , of less than @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and associated bh mass fractions , @xmath48 , of less than 0.18 and 0.21 . with only upper limits to the radio luminosities , we can not rule out the likely scenario of contamination from x - ray - emitting stellar - mass bhs in these gcs .",
    "3 .   a semi - empirical model developed for milky way gcs converts the upper limits on radio luminosities to upper limits on imbh masses . applying this model to m81 , over a dozen individual gcs appear to have upper limits on the bh mass fractions , @xmath48 , that are below the noteworthy value of 0.15 reported for m60-ucd1 . also , the m81 stacks correspond to imbh masses of @xmath59 for all the gcs and to @xmath52 for the massive gcs .",
