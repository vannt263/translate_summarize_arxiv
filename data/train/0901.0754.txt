    "since the celebrated paper by edwards and anderson@xcite , mean - field theory of spin glass ( sg ) has been extensively investigated .",
    "the replica theory@xcite is one of the most successful achievement that has revealed the nature of the low temperature phase of mean - field sg models .",
    "parisi s pioneering work provided the replica method with implementation of replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) .",
    "originally , @xmath0 step rsb ( @xmath0rsb ) was proposed as `` a sequence of approximated solutions '' to the true solution and the full rsb solution was derived as a @xmath4 limit .",
    "this approach has actually proven to be exact recently@xcite for the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model@xcite . although this introduction of rsb is motivated by de almeida - thouless ( at ) condition@xcite , which is the instability of replica symmetric ( rs ) solution with respect to replica couplings , it should be noted that at instability is only one of the possible scenario for rsb@xcite and that the origin of rsb is in general model - dependent .",
    "in addition , a 1rsb solution for various mean - field sg models@xcite is stable with respect to further rsb perturbation , and @xmath0rsb rarely appears for @xmath5 .",
    "these facts suggest that there is another mechanism to break the replica symmetry and it distinguishes 1rsb from full rsb ( frsb ) .",
    "recently , the authors have shown@xcite that @xmath6-body sk model , which is a typical model to exhibit a sg transition to 1rsb phase , actually has another reason to break the replica symmetry above the gardner temperature@xcite .",
    "it is the monotonicity condition of the cumulant generating function of the free energy @xmath7 , whose limiting value at @xmath8 is the averaged free energy , rather than the at condition that causes rsb@xcite .",
    "the relevance of these conditions is reversed at the gardner temperature , where the transition between 1rsb and full rsb takes place .",
    "furthermore , it is proved that if the monotonicity is broken in the absence of external field , which ensures the smallest overlap parameter @xmath9 , then the correct 1rsb solution is given by the rs solution at @xmath10 , which is defined as the monotonicity breaking point , @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "this has revealed that the continuation of the cumulant generating function @xmath7 to @xmath13 is strongly restricted by a kind of thermodynamic constraints and that it naturally induces the 1rsb solution in the case of a fully connected mean - field sg model . regarding @xmath14 as a fictitious inverse temperature",
    ", we can resort to the thermodynamics for extracting high - temperature , or replica , limit(@xmath15 ) from low - temperature behavior(@xmath16 ) .",
    "these facts strongly suggest that 1rsb is a consequence of the monotonicity breaking and frsb is that of at stability breaking .",
    "finite connectivity sg model has been considered as a first non - trivial extension of the mean - field theory , and challenged in many literatures . as a straight - forward extension from the case of fully connected model ,",
    "perturbation theories in the region of the large connectivity or near the transition temperature have been studied in the replica formalism@xcite .",
    "another replica calculation@xcite has succeeded to derive an exact expression of the free energy under a non - trivial ansatz called factorized ansatz .",
    "the difficulty in these works appears in the search for an rsb saddle - point , because rsb is defined using the symmetry of a saddle - point in the theory .",
    "in contrast , the cavity method turned out to be an alternative and promising approach to study the finite connectivity models within 1rsb scheme@xcite .",
    "the key concept of this method is the complexity@xcite , logarithm of a number of the pure states , which enables one to deeply understand the microscopic structure of configuration space .",
    "it is found that the non - negativity condition of the complexity is relevant for the 1rsb cavity scheme , that provides a general procedure for mean - field type models including finite connectivity sg .    in this paper",
    ", we further examine the possibility of 1rsb scenario suggested in our previous work , which might be important for a better understanding of the sg theory and also the replica method itself .",
    "the model discussed is a finite - connectivity ising sg model with @xmath0-body interactions .",
    "the reason why this model is considered as a good example is twofold . first our construction of 1rsb solution is applicable to the finite - connectivity sg model , because rs solution can be explicitly obtained .",
    "second , we see a direct correspondence between the guiding principle of introducing 1rsb in the replica method and the cavity method@xcite .    the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rep ] , we review our previous work@xcite for complete and detailed instructions of our scheme , in which a construction of a 1rsb solution from rs ansatz is explained . then a sg model defined on a sparse random graph is introduced and the 1rsb solution for the model obtained by our scheme is presented .",
