    "experimental data on hadronic resonances have largely shifted from elastic scattering to production processes over the past decade . nevertheless , the thus observed hadrons are supposed to be identical to the corresponding ones first seen in elastic scattering .",
    "this generally accepted uniqueness of resonance mass and width , irrespective of the underlying process , reflects itself in the universality of the pole structure of the resonance amplitude or subamplitude . however",
    ", this does of course not mean that a resonance is produced with a fixed probability in all processes where it shows up .",
    "this will depend on microscopic details of a specific production process , the corresponding vertex functions , and possibly also on effects from final - state interactions with other particles produced alongside .",
    "clearly , theory has not managed to keep up with this fast experimental development .",
    "this is no surprise in view of the extremely difficult dynamics at the quark level involved in a three - meson decay , not to speak of decays to even more mesons .",
    "nevertheless , it would already be significant progress if one could use an amplitude ansatz with the correct resonance - pole structure , as derived from a demonstrably working model for elastic meson - meson scattering and meson spectroscopy .    in this spirit",
    ", we propose to start from the so - called resonance - spectrum expansion ( rse ) in order to obtain such an ansatz .",
    "for that purpose , we construct here the amplitude for the production of a pair of interacting mesons out of a quark - antiquark pair , using a previously developed coupled - channel model @xcite , and its reformulation @xcite in terms of an expansion in the radial confinement spectrum of the @xmath8 pair , the rse .",
    "we assume thereby that the decay processes @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 take place in cascades of two subsequent @xmath8 pair - creation processes , triggered by a weak process and resulting in one spectator meson plus a pair of rescattered mesons . for the decay @xmath5 , we assume that one of the @xmath9 mesons is formed in the weak process , whereas the remaining @xmath10 pair stems from @xmath8 pair creation . in either case",
    ", the spectator meson is supposed to be formed in the first step of the cascade process , alongside a @xmath8 pair .",
    "the latter pair is supposed to couple to the pair of rescattered mesons .",
    "accordingly , we substitute the three - meson vertex for the final process by the transition potential of ref .  @xcite .",
    "this interaction couples @xmath8 to a pair of mesons .",
    "this pair is supposed to interact via quark loops , which is described by the rse ladder sum .",
    "the quark loops , representing the dynamics of the two interacting mesons , can be written in a closed analytic form @xcite , and , consequently , the full production amplitude as well .",
    "this is not the case for the initial three - meson vertex  either weak or strong  which is here just represented by a complex coupling constant .",
    "the rse has the advantage that all possible resonances for a given set of quantum numbers are contained in one expression .",
    "therefore , the overlapping of resonances and their possible mixing @xcite is automatically taken care of .",
    "also , by employing spherical bessel and hankel functions for meson - meson distributions , the expressions become automatically real below threshold , thus curing the problem of subthreshold complex phases occurring in other methods @xcite .",
    "but it has yet another advantage . the elastic two - meson ( @xmath11 ) scattering amplitude , which can be written in the form @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 represents the born term of the transition potential @xmath14 and @xmath15 the two - meson propagator , leads for production to an expression of the form @xmath16 as a result , we obtain for production , in an analytically exact manner , just the common denominator of the elastic scattering amplitude for all coupled scattering channels .",
    "hence , the pole structure of elastic scattering is , with our method , manifestly preserved in production .",
    "of course , resonance line shapes can be different for elastic scattering and production , since those also depend on the numerators of the corresponding rse expressions .",
    "the three - meson vertex for the final process , here represented by the transition potential of ref .",
    "@xcite , results , through bauer s formula @xcite , in a form factor determined by a spherical bessel function , which depends on the angular momentum of a specific two - meson channel .",
    "this automatically yields the form factors and centrifugal barriers that other approaches have to provide empirically ( see e.g.refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the initial vertices for strong cascades might be treated as well within the recoupling scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite , but we shall leave this for later study . here , the initial three - meson vertices are just represented by complex coupling constants , as in the isobar model ( see e.g.ref .",
    "@xcite for a practical application ) , to be adjusted to the data .",
    "nevertheless , it should be mentioned that from the recoupling scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite one obtains values for the initial - process coupling constants which are very similar in magnitude to the ones used here .",
    "this indicates that the cascade assumption is very reasonable , but most probably that also some dynamics has to be considered for the initial processes , before all can be predicted by theory . in the prsent paper",
    ", it is our aim to demonstrate that the final production vertex can be handled in a very elegant way through the rse .",
    "we shall compare our results to data taken by the bes @xcite , e791 @xcite and focus @xcite collaborations .",
    "it turns out that the data can be very well described by our amplitudes .",
    "however , contrary to the focus analysis @xcite , we shall find here that the background in their data is negligible . in refs .",
    "@xcite there are similar conclusions with respect to the data of e791 @xcite , lass @xcite and besii @xcite .",
    "it is very fortunate that such data exist nowadays .",
    "twenty years ago it would have been impossible to verify whether results as presented here make any sense at all .",
    "today , we may even discover that data are very well described .",
    "the organisation of this paper is as follows . in section  [ rse1",
    "] , we discuss the details of the rse for elastic scattering .",
    "the production amplitude for the rse is derived in section  [ swavestudy ] , and the @xmath0-wave predictions are compared to the data . in order to improve the description of the data via rse amplitudes , we show that at least also @xmath1-waves must be included , which is discussed in section  [ pwavestudy ] . in section  [ rse2 ]",
    "we give some more discussion of the details of the rse amplitudes for elastic scattering .",
    "section  [ conclusie ] contains our conclusions .",
    "the rse has been developed @xcite for the description of meson - meson scattering resonances and bound states , in a non - perturbative approach that aims at unquenching the @xmath8 confinement spectrum .",
    "it consists of a simple analytic expression which can be straightforwardly applied to all possible non - exotic systems of two mesons .",
    "the rse goes beyond simple spectroscopy , since it describes the scattering amplitude , not only at a resonance , but also for energies where no resonance exists .",
    "in contrast to models which have to rely upon numerical methods of solution , the rse has the additional advantage that the pole structure of its scattering amplitude can be studied in great detail , owing to its closed analytic form .",
    "the expression for the amplitude can even be analytically continued , in an exact manner , to below the lowest threshold , where bound states show up as poles on the real energy axis .",
    "the rse easily handles many coupled meson - meson channels , or coupled systems with different internal flavours . as such",
    ", it is an ideal expression for the study of scattering theory in general , i.e. , the study of resonance structures and their relation to some of the many @xmath0-matrix singularities , as well as the concept of riemann sheets and analytic continuation anywhere in the complex energy plane .",
    "the basic ingredients of the rse are confinement and quark - pair creation . in its lowest - order approximation ,",
    "a permanently confined quark - antiquark system is assumed , having a spectrum with an infinite number of bound states , related to the details of the confining force .",
    "we shall denote the energy levels of this confinement spectrum by @xmath17 ( @xmath18 , 1 , 2 , @xmath19 ) . here",
    ", we assume that the confinement spectrum is given by @xmath20 which choice is anyhow rather immaterial for the purpose of our present study .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 represents , to lowest order , the ground - state mass of the @xmath22-wave of the quark - antiquark system , which is related to the effective flavour masses of the system .",
    "the strength of the confinement force is parametrised by @xmath23 and gauged by the level splittings of the system . in experiment",
    "one can not directly measure the quantities @xmath21 and @xmath23 , because of the large higher - order contributions .",
    "consequently , the lowest - order system is purely hypothetical .",
    "nevertheless , one can obtain some order - of - magnitude insight by examining mesonic spectra with more than one experimentally known recurrency .    from the @xmath24 charmonium and bottomonium states",
    ", one may conclude that the average level splitting is of the order of 380 mev , leading to @xmath25 mev , independent of flavour .",
    "the latter property is compatible with the flavour blindness of qcd , confirmed by experiment @xcite .",
    "indeed , the level splittings of the positive - parity @xmath26 mesons seem to confirm that flavour independence can be extended to light quarks @xcite . from the ground states of the recurrencies",
    "one may then extract the order of magnitude of the effective quark masses , e.g.  @xmath27 gev ( in the rse @xcite we find for twice the effective charm mass the value 3.124 gev ) , or @xmath28 gev ( 0.812 gev in the rse ) .",
    "for the choice ( [ t00ho ] ) of confinement force , we determine @xmath29 .",
    "once the effective flavour masses and @xmath23 are fixed @xcite , we may describe other systems , like scalar mesons and mixed flavours @xcite .    through quark - pair creation",
    "the @xmath8 system is coupled to those two - meson systems which are allowed by quantum numbers . in principle",
    ", many different two - meson channels can couple to one specific quark - antiquark system . here",
    ", since we study the properties of the channel lowest in mass , we will strip the rse of all other possible two - meson channels , thereby assuming that their influence far below their respective thresholds will be negligible . via consecutive quark - pair creation and annihilation",
    ", a @xmath8 pair may also couple to pairs of different flavour , for instance @xmath30 . here",
    ", as we study pion - pion scattering near threshold , we shall assume that the coupling of a light pair of flavours to strange - antistrange can be ignored .",
    "the intensity of quark - pair creation is in the rse parametrised by the flavour - independent parameter @xmath31 . in principle",
    ", it has to be adjusted to the data .",
    "however , one may get an idea of the right order of magnitude by the following reasoning .",
    "for small values of @xmath31 , one may determine the width of the ground - state resonance in the one - channel case ( pion - pion here ) by @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 represents the average distance at which light quark pairs are created , and which can also be defined in a flavour - independent fashion @xcite .",
    "note that this picture of a relatively well - defined interquark distance at which pair creation is favoured qualitatively agrees with very recent unquenched lattice simulations of string breaking @xcite .",
    "even our values of @xmath33 , at least for heavy quarks , are roughly in agreement with the latter lattice predictions . for light quarks , @xmath33 is about 0.6 fm , as we will see later on .",
    "if we take , for example , the @xmath34(1370 ) resonance width of 0.20.5 gev , then we obtain @xmath35 0.600.95 .",
    "this is of the order of 1 , which would not allow the approximation ( [ rsewidth ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we actually employ here a value for @xmath31 which is of the same order of magnitude as our estimate ( see caption of fig .",
    "[ t00figures ] ) .",
    "the rse amplitude suitable for our purposes results from the ladder sum in quark - pair creation @xcite , and has for @xmath2 elastic scattering the form ( @xmath36 and @xmath15 represent respectively the quark - loop box and the two - pion propagator . ) @xmath37 & = & { \\frac{\\textstyle 1}{\\textstyle 8\\pi^{2}}}\\ , \\sum_{\\ell = 0}^{\\infty}\\ , ( 2\\ell + 1 ) p_{\\ell}\\left(\\hat{p}\\cdot{\\hat{p}\\,}'\\;\\right)\\ , { { \\frac{\\textstyle \\raisebox{15pt}{$2\\lambda^{2}\\mu pa\\ , j_{\\ell}(pa)\\ , j_{\\ell}(p'a)\\ , { \\displaystyle \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty } } { { \\frac{\\textstyle \\raisebox{3pt}{$g_{n\\ell}^{2}$}}{\\textstyle \\raisebox{-3pt}{$e_{n1}-e(p)$}}}}$}}{\\textstyle \\raisebox{-15pt}{$1 - 2i\\lambda^{2}\\mu pa\\ , j_{\\ell}(pa)\\ , h^{(1)}_{\\ell}(pa)\\ , { \\displaystyle \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty } } { { \\frac{\\textstyle \\raisebox{3pt}{$g_{n\\ell}^{2}$}}{\\textstyle \\raisebox{-3pt}{$e_{n1}-e(p)$}}}}$ } } } } \\;\\;\\ ; , \\label{tfull}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is defined in eq .",

    ", the latter is an impossible task , of course .",
    "however , omitting meson - meson channels has an influence on the resulting resonance pole positions .",
    "thus , the coupling constants of the remaining channels act as effective parameters , which must be adjusted in order to reproduce the elastic scattering data . at low energies",
    ", there is a negligible effect on pole positions and resonance shapes from meson - meson channels with much higher thresholds . accordingly",
    ", their omission has little influence on @xmath31 .",
    "so , for energies below 1 gev , it is a reasonable approximation to restrict the allowed meson - meson channels to those containing a pair of pseudoscalar mesons , and even to only @xmath2 and @xmath3 , for the isoscalar and isodoublet cases , respectively .",
    "the only situation where this philosophy does not work well here is for the @xmath63(800 ) pole .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath64 channel takes @xcite about half of the total coupling , but nevertheless does not contribute significantly to the @xmath63 pole position , since this high - lying channel is strongly damped there . as a consequence , in this case",
    "the effective coupling for @xmath3 to @xmath65 @xmath66 comes out some 35 percent below the average flavour - independent value of @xmath31 .",
    "the effective average interaction radius @xmath33 mainly controls the resonance width , which is relatively sensitive to the omission of higher thresholds , as can be observed from table  [ modelparameters ] .",
    "the effective flavour masses @xmath67 mev and @xmath68 mev , as well as the average mesonic level splitting @xmath25 gev , have been determined in ref .",
    "these parameters generate the quenched quark - antiquark spectrum , which should be compared to corresponding lattice calculations .",
    "for example , in a very recent preprint @xcite the scalar collaboration found 1.58@xmath690.35 gev for the lightest isoscalar scalar meson and 1.71@xmath690.54 gev for its isodoublet partner , which in the rse ( ref .",

    "( [ t00ho ] ) for @xmath70 ) at 1.29 and 1.39 gev , respectively .",
    "however , by assuming the latter values in the quenched approximation , one can in the rse even determine the lowest @xmath0-matrix poles @xcite , by adjusting the model parameters @xmath33 and @xmath31 to the available elastic @xmath0- @xcite and @xmath1-wave @xcite scattering data .",
    "moreover , as mentioned above , the very string - breaking picture underlying the rse , and even the empirically found values for @xmath33 have received strong support from recent unquenched lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "therefore , the rse is really capable of relating experiment to qcd , via the lattice .    in previous work @xcite , and also for the theoretical curves in red shown in fig .",
    "[ kpifigures ] , we used a value of 1.31 gev for the ground state of the @xmath65 @xmath66 confinement spectrum , which is about 80 mev below its value following from eq .",

    "the corresponding @xmath63 pole thus moves from @xcite @xmath71 mev to @xmath72 mev .",
