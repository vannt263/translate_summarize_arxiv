    "one of the proposals for explaining the present accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite is modifying einstein s theory of gravity by introducing corrections to the einstein - hilbert lagrangian .",
    "these theories , called `` modified gravity theories '' @xcite follow this idea that the accelerated expansion of the universe may be has a geometric interpretation instead of adding the exotic forms of energy sources , dubbed `` dark energy '' @xcite . in the other words , in this perspective the dark energy is a manifestation of a modified gravitational interaction rather than a new form of energy density .",
    "the situation is reminiscent of the problem of precession of mercury s orbit . in the mid - nineteenth century",
    "the anomalous behavior of mercury firstly was attributed to some unobserved ( `` dark '' ) planet in the solar system while it was mainly due to the failure of newton s theory of gravity in the strong gravitational field regime . in this view",
    ", it seems that as long as the dark energy particles @xcite have not been observed directly , the `` geometric '' candidates have important role .",
    "the simplest form of the modified gravity theories can be obtained by replacing the ricci scalar @xmath3 with an arbitrary general function @xmath2 in the einstein - hilbert action , usually called @xmath2 theory of gravity .",
    "for a recent review of this theory see @xcite .",
    "metric @xmath2 gravity model is dynamically equivalent to a bd scalar tensor theory with coupling constant @xmath1 @xcite . by using this equivalence",
    ", one can easily find the prediction of metric @xmath2 gravity for the ppn parameter @xmath4 .",
    "this parameter in the bd theory has the form @xmath5 .",
    "thus the value of this parameter in the metric @xmath2 gravity is @xmath6 which it is not in agreement with the experimental bound @xmath7@xcite .",
    "however , considering this model in the einstein frame has some satisfactory features .",
    "for example , @xmath2 gravity can display the chameleon behavior in this frame which helps to relax the weak field limit problem of @xmath2 gravity @xcite .",
    "chameleon effect is firstly interpreted using the scalar tensor framework of dark energy @xcite . in this theory",
    "the effective mass of the scalar field is a function of the curvature of space - time and consequently it can be large at the solar system and small on the cosmological scales .",
    "this behavior appears in the minimally coupled scalar tensor theory if there exists an energy transfer between the dark energy fluid and the ordinary matter fluid .",
    "since the quintessence model @xcite is a minimally coupled scalar tensor theory , the chameleon mechanism can be appeared . on the other hand ,",
    "metric @xmath2 gravity theories are conformally equivalent to models of quintessence in which matter is coupled to the dark energy , thus the chameleon effect can occur in the conformal frame @xcite .    the noninteracting quintessence models can be divided into two categories @xcite .",
    "`` freezing '' models : in these models the equation of state parameter of dark energy , @xmath8 , has an arbitrary value initially and decreases with time and asymptotically approaches @xmath9 .",
    "`` thawing '' models : these models have a value of @xmath10 initially , and it increases with time .",
    "there is a subset of freezing models which display tracking behavior @xcite . in the tracking models",
    ", @xmath8 has an arbitrary value initially and it is nearly constant during the tracking era . when the tracking era terminates then @xmath8 decreases and asymptotically approaches -1 .",
    "the important feature of these models is that the evolution of the scalar field is insensitive to the initial conditions and the dark energy density drops with a slower rate than the matter energy density and finally overtakes it .",
    "albeit , these models can not provide a solution to the so - called coincidence problem because other fine - tunings are needed on the free parameters of these models in order to have an appropriate amount of dark energy compatible with observation in the present days@xcite .    in our recent paper@xcite we derived some conditions for existing the stable tracker solutions in the einstein frame of metric @xmath2 gravity models .",
    "it is found that the tracker solutions with @xmath11 exist if @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a dimensionless function defined by relation in the next section .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to find out the necessary conditions for the existence of thawing behavior in the einstein frame of metric @xmath2 gravity theories .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section ii we start with bd scalar tensor theory ( with an arbitrary @xmath15 ) . as mentioned before",
    ", this theory behaves as an interacting quintessence model in this frame .",
    "we derive some necessary conditions on the form of the potential @xmath0 in order to lead to the thawing behavior for @xmath8 . in section iii , by setting @xmath1 in the results , we present a general description of the behavior of the thawing @xmath2 in the einstein frame and finally conditions on the form of @xmath2 gravity have been derived . throughout this work we have chosen the unit @xmath16 , the metric signature is @xmath17 and the universe",
    "is assumed to be spatially flat .",
    "the effective action for bd scalar tensor theory is given by @xmath18\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the ricci scalar , @xmath20 is the potential of the scalar field and @xmath21 represents the matter lagrangian density .",
    "note that all tilded quantities are in the jordan frame .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath15 should be large to pass the experimental testes .",
    "the observational constraint on @xmath15 is @xmath22 @xcite . under the conformal transformation @xmath23",
    "where @xmath24 and @xmath25 , one can obtain the einstein frame action @xmath26 \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 .",
    "we see that in the einstein frame the scalar field couples conformally to matter via the function @xmath28 but couples minimally to the gravity sector . for a spatially flat frw universe ,",
    "the modified friedmann equations are given by @xmath29 \\end{split}\\ ] ] and the equation of motion of the scalar field is @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the equation of state parameter of the ordinary matter with the energy density @xmath33 in the einstein frame .",
    "also @xmath34 and @xmath35 represent the energy density and pressure of the dark energy respectively .",
    "the conservation equations of the scalar field fluid and the cosmic fluid are @xmath36 and the energy density of matter @xmath33 , pressure @xmath37 , cosmic time @xmath38 and the scale factor @xmath39 are related to their jordan frame counterparts through @xcite @xmath40 during the matter dominated era , by using equation ( [ scalar field eom ] ) , one can introduce an effective potential as follows @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a conserved quantity in the einstein frame @xcite , which is related to @xmath33 via the relation @xmath43 .",
    "since the late time evolution of the universe is of interest here and also our main purpose is to explore the role of the interaction term ( which is nonzero for the matter component ) , we neglect the radiation component and assume that the universe contains only dust and dark energy .",
    "it is interesting to note that the interaction term is commonly assumed to be zero in the radiation dominated era , but recently cembranos and _ et al _ @xcite have shown that this interaction term can lead to strong impact on cosmology in the radiation dominated era due to the finite temperature radiative corrections . in the other words",
    ", there exists another source term for scalar field given by the conformal anomaly which leads to a nonzero trace of energy momentum tensor in the radiation dominated era ( note that the rhs of is the trace of energy momentum tensor ) . considering the conformally coupled scalar field with a quadratic coupling function and vanishing potential , the above effect leads to a temporary contracting phase in which the temperature increases@xcite .",
    "however , as mentioned before , we aim to study here the late time evolution of the universe and so we assume that the universe is filled with non - relativistic matter .",
    "following reference @xcite , we introduce the variables @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 defined by @xmath47 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath48 . by these definitions",
    ", it is an easy job to show that the equations and become @xmath49 where @xmath50 for thawing models @xmath51 and so @xmath52 .",
    "thus it is convenient to express the above equations with respect to @xmath53 in order to exploit its smallness by expanding quantities to the lowest order in @xmath53 .",
    "also we assume that @xmath54 @xmath55 .",
    "this assumption , as considered in @xcite , is necessary to have an increasing dark energy density parameter i.e. @xmath56 .",
    "however , the results can be generalized to the opposite case @xmath57 .",
    "now , by using @xmath58 and @xmath59 , one can rewrite the equations in terms of @xmath53 and @xmath60 as @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 it is clear from equation that for thawing models @xmath64 during the cosmological history of the universe @xmath65 .",
    "thus by using we can write equation as follows @xmath66 this equation is obtained earlier in @xcite in which , the non - minimal quintessence with nearly flat potentials has been considered .",
    "equation is not a simple differential equation and for solving it , we will make some assumptions which are satisfied for thawing models .",
    "first assume that @xmath67 , by retaining terms up to the first order in @xmath53 , the equation takes the following form @xmath68 another useful equation can be obtained by using the equation of motion of the scalar field @xmath69-\\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{8}{3}}\\beta}{2-\\gamma } \\frac{1-\\omega_{\\varphi}}{\\omega_{\\varphi}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation can be written to the first order in @xmath53 as follows @xmath70-\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\beta\\frac{1-\\omega_{\\varphi}}{\\omega_{\\varphi}}\\ ] ]    for uncoupled quintessence , where @xmath71 is zero , the rhs of equation is approximately constant and moreover it has an small amount ( note that @xmath67 ) for thawing solutions . thus if @xmath72 then the thawing behavior can occur @xcite .",
    "in the general case where @xmath71 is not zero , then the rhs can not be regarded as a constant . since @xmath60 is appeared in the denominator , hence the second term in the rhs is dominated initially and has a large value .",
    "thus the lhs can not have a small value as well as can not be a constant .",
    "when @xmath60 gets larger , the effect of the interaction becomes weaker .",
    "thus , at late times , the nearly flat region of the potential leads to the thawing uncoupled quintessence .",
    "so , unlike the noninteracting quintessence model , nearly flat potentials can not lead to the thawing behavior when an explicit energy transfer between the scalar field fluid and the matter fluid exists . in this case , as mentioned in @xcite , with nearly flat potentials , @xmath8 firstly increases with time and then , when the interaction becomes weaker , it decreases and approaches asymptotically to a value near @xmath9 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath8 with nearly flat potentials has been plotted in fig.[nearly flat ] by solving equation numerically .",
    "note that this behavior is due to the special form of interaction which appeared here ( i.e. @xmath73 ) .",
    "now we are ready to make the second assumption .",
    "taking into account equation and assuming that the value of the term within the bracket to be approximately constant for thawing solutions , this equation gives @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a positive constant .",
    "hereafter we shall refer to this equation as the `` thawing condition '' . for potentials in which @xmath76 decreases as @xmath77 increases ( @xmath78 )",
    ", the lhs of the equation is increasing . on the other hand",
    ", the rhs is increasing because @xmath60 increases .",
    "hence , the thawing condition can not be satisfied .",
    "thus , the thawing condition shows that it is necessary @xmath46 increases with time when @xmath77 and @xmath60 are increasing , i.e. @xmath79 it is clear from the thawing condition that if @xmath80 then @xmath46 is nearly constant and so @xmath81 .",
    "one can find other simple conditions on the form of @xmath0 by using the thawing condition .",
    "for this purpose , let us rewrite as follows @xmath82 it is clear from this equation that the second term in the rhs is dominated initially and so @xmath83 . as mentioned before , the interaction becomes weaker at late times .",
    "thus , there exists a time @xmath84 , at which @xmath85 at this time @xmath86 and after it @xmath87 .",
    "thus , it is necessary that the potential has a maximum in order to have thawing behavior . in the other words , a value of the scalar field",
    ", @xmath88 should exist such that @xmath89    now let us to justify the thawing condition . by these assumptions",
    "( @xmath67 and ) , equation takes the very simple following form @xmath90 in which @xmath91 .",
    "note that if @xmath80 , then this equation becomes precisely the equation obtained earlier by scherrer and sen @xcite .",
    "this differential equation has an exact solution as follows @xmath92^{2 } \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is an integration constant depending on the initial conditions and @xmath94 is the gauss hypergeometric function .",
    "this equation gives an analytical expression for the state parameter of dark energy as a function of its density parameter for the thawing non - minimal quintessence model .",
    "it generalizes the result obtained in @xcite for thawing minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "the behavior of @xmath8 as a function of @xmath60 has been shown in fig.[beta0.5 ] for various values of @xmath75 .",
    "the @xmath71 has been chosen to be @xmath95 , the value will be used in the next section in the case of @xmath2 gravity models .",
    "in fact , the value of @xmath75 should be such that @xmath8 has a value near @xmath9 today .    for confronting the model with observational data",
    ", it is needed to express @xmath53 and @xmath60 in terms of cosmic red shift or cosmic scale factor . by substituting the solution in the equation",
    ", we obtain a differential equation for @xmath60 in which the gauss hypergeometric function is appeared . here",
    ", we have solved it numerically and the result has been compared with the exact solution of the equation when @xmath96 , in fig.[numericallomega ] .",
    "thus as it is clear from fig.[numericallomega ] , the difference between these solutions is small when @xmath97 and consequently one can use the solution of when @xmath96 i.e. @xmath98^{-1}\\ ] ] in order to find out an approximated expression for @xmath53 as a function of @xmath39 .",
    "now let us consider @xmath99 gravity in the einstein frame .",
    "it is sufficient to set @xmath1 ( and so @xmath100 ) in equation in order to have thawing behavior in the einstein frame .",
    "also in the context of @xmath99 gravity , the scalar field @xmath77 is related to the curvature scalar of the jordan frame as follows @xmath101 where @xmath102 . as it is clear from fig.[beta0.5 ] ,",
    "@xmath75 has been chosen near to @xmath103 in order to have @xmath8 near @xmath104 . in this case , as it has been shown in fig.[numericallomega ] , @xmath60 evolves as the dark energy density parameter of @xmath105cdm model in which @xmath8 is always approximated to @xmath9 .",
    "now , we want to find out explicit conditions on the form of the function @xmath99 in order to have thawing behavior in the einstein frame .",
    "taking into account equations and , one can easily verify that if @xmath106 then @xmath107 and for @xmath108 @xmath109 also , by using and , it is necessary that the form of @xmath99 be such that there exists @xmath110 for which @xmath111 note that for having nonsingular conformal transformation ( equations and ) we have assumed @xmath112 .",
    "equations - are the necessary conditions on the form of @xmath99 for raising to the thawing behavior and they are not sufficient conditions .    now , let us to find out an explicit example for thawing potentials .",
    "for this purpose , assume that @xmath113 where , @xmath114 is a positive constant .",
    "this assumption leads to the following form of dark energy density parameter @xmath115 which is an increasing function of @xmath77 and @xmath116 is an integration constant . using @xmath117 and equations , and",
    ", we obtain @xmath118 where @xmath119 .",
    "if @xmath114 is a small quantity ( @xmath120 ) , then the solution with minus sign can yield to the thawing behavior . for seeing this ,",
    "@xmath8 has been plotted in fig.[example ] for various values of @xmath114 . by substituting equation into equation and expanding the rhs of equation to the second order in @xmath114 (",
    "note that we have assumed that @xmath114 is small ) , we get @xmath121 which has the following solution @xmath122    where @xmath123 is a positive integration constant .",
    "it is obvious from this that @xmath124 has a maximum and so it is consistent with our pervious results . by setting @xmath116 to be zero and using equation ,",
    "let us rewrite equation as a function of the scalar field as follows @xmath125 this potential satisfies the conditions and and it is a two parameter potential ( @xmath123 and @xmath114 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath114 should be small and for @xmath126 it should be @xmath127 .",
    "thus , the only free parameter in this model is @xmath123 . as mentioned before , this free parameter should be fin - tuned by using the observational data .",
    "the observational fact is that the energy density of dark energy and the energy density of cosmic matter fluid are approximately in the same order .",
    "since the potential has been obtained with respect to @xmath60 ( equation ) it is easy to make an estimation on the values of @xmath123 to reproduce the acceleration expansion .",
    "albeit , we assume that the major contribution to the energy of the scalar field is due to the potential term ( note that this is the case for all thawing potentials ) .",
    "the density parameter of dark energy is @xmath128 by using this equation and we obtain @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the current value of the hubble parameter . by taking into account that the current value of @xmath131 satisfies the bound @xmath132 , we have plotted the region of parameter space able to cover the above observational constraints , in fig .",
    "[ fintuning ] .",
    "this region varies from @xmath133 to @xmath134 and from @xmath135 to @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is a dimensionless variable defined as follows @xmath138 note that for making a more precise estimation one should use numerical solutions of the field equations and taking into account the effect of the kinetic term of energy density of the dark energy , see the third paper of @xcite and also @xcite for more details .",
    "now , for finding the corresponding @xmath99 function , assume that @xmath99 differs from einstein s general relativity by a small perturbation as follows @xmath139 where @xmath140 is a very small parameter . by substituting this in equation , using and taking @xmath141 ,",
    "one reaches to the following first order differential equation up to the first order in @xmath140 @xmath142 which has the solution of the form @xmath143 where @xmath144 since @xmath114 is a positive constant , @xmath145 is a negative real number .",
    "thus , the perturbation procedure is valid if the curvature of space time is sufficiently high such that @xmath146 .",
    "consequently , the model can lead to the thawing behavior only in the beginning of matter dominated era .",
    "however , for larger values of @xmath77 , let us expand the potential again . before proceeding , we expect that @xmath147 contains some terms of @xmath19 with powers smaller than @xmath145 . because such a term can have effect in the late times ( large @xmath77 ) , where the curvature is small , while it can be neglected compared with @xmath148 where the curvature is larger .    if @xmath77 is large enough such that @xmath149 then one can write the potential as follows @xmath150 it is easy to show that the @xmath99 function corresponding to this potential is @xmath151 where @xmath152 it is possible to make an estimation on the value of @xmath114 by assuming that the potential is a solution of differential equation when @xmath153 .",
    "thus , @xmath154 and consequently @xmath155 . by this amount for @xmath114 ,",
    "@xmath156 is negative and also it is smaller than @xmath145 ( m=-3.45 ) , as we expected .    as a result",
    ", the following model @xmath157 can lead to the thawing behavior in the matter dominated epoch and late times .",
    "note that this model satisfies the condition .",
    "also , as we required , it s corresponding potential in the einstein frame has a maximum .",
    "we have considered bd scalar tensor theory in the einstein frame . in this frame",
    ", bd theory behaves like an interacting quintessence .",
    "it is necessary that the potential @xmath0 has a maximum in the region where the scalar field rolls in order to have thawing behavior .",
    "also the potential should satisfy the condition @xmath158 .",
    "the thawing condition shows that for non - interacting quintessence model , potential should satisfy the condition @xmath159 @xcite .    in the last section , by setting the bd coupling constant @xmath15 to zero , we have studied the thawing behavior of @xmath99 gravity models in the einstein frame .",
    "it is important to note that for power law @xmath99 gravity models , such as , the equation of state parameter of dark energy ( in the einstein frame ) firstly increases with time and then decreases .",
    "this behavior is due to the form of the corresponding potential of these models in the einstein frame . for these models , @xmath46 is constant and as we have mentioned in section ii , @xmath8 evolve as fig .",
    "[ nearly flat ] .",
    "the sign of the power of @xmath19 depends on the present day value of @xmath8 and it s magnitude depends on @xmath75 . as it is clear from fig .",
    "[ nearly flat ] , choosing different values for @xmath75 leads to different values of @xmath8 at the present day .    as an example for thawing @xmath99 models , we have proposed the model given by .",
    "the corresponding potential has a maximum and the condition @xmath158 is satisfied .",
    "so , in the beginning of the matter dominated era @xmath46 is not approximately constant , ( see equation ) , and @xmath8 increases slowly as it has been shown in fig .",
    "[ example ] . also this model leads to a nearly flat potential in the late times which is satisfactory . at sufficiently late times ,",
    "the interaction term in equation is negligible and we expect our model behaves like a non - interacting thawing quintessence @xcite .",
