    "especially molecular dynamics ( md ) calculations for polymers in order to reveal the dynamical behavior of the chain structure have been carried out .",
    "md calculations for long - chain polymers , however , have been limited by the massive computational costs due to the very long relaxation times of entangled long - chain polymer melts . according to reptation theory , the relaxation time of an entangled polymer melt consisting of chains with @xmath0 monomers scales as @xmath1 .",
    "this means that a prohibitively long simulation time is needed to relax a dense polymer melt .",
    "moreover , a complex system such as an entangled polymer melt exhibits a huge number of local - minimum energy states in the free energy surface .",
    "energetic barriers much larger than the thermal energies separate the initial configurations from the final equilibrium states , which leads to relaxation times far greater than currently accessible computational resources allow .    the coarse - grained ( cg ) approach for polymer molecules , in which multiple atoms are combined into a large bead , enable us to extend the spatial and time scales of the simulation .",

    "methods for overcoming the local energy minimum on the energy surface have been intensively studied @xcite .",
    "the multicanonical md method @xcite enables sampling over a much larger phase space , and was applied to a cg model of protein folding @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "md simulations for long - chain polymer melts are performed by a hybrid md / continuum method , in which the dynamics of the atoms is coupled with the those of the continuum degrees of freedom concurrently .",
    "this hybrid method was originally proposed by our group , and it has been applied to a simple one - dimensional system @xcite , in which the spring force of the continuum acts on the atomic chain system and generates large - scale fluctuations and a variety of atomic phonon modes in the atomic chain . in the present paper , the hybrid method",
    "is applied to a polymer melt consisting of long - chain polymers .",
    "we demonstrate that the large - scale fluctuation induces a large number of states of the long - chain polymers , which overcomes the energetic barriers , and leads to the fast convergence towards the final equilibrium state .",
    "our purpose is to show the result of accelerating md calculations using the md / continuum hybrid method and the effectiveness of this method for long - chain polymer simulations .",
    "we describe a single polymer as a bead - spring chain in which monomers of the polymer are represented by spherical beads .",
    "the beads have an excluded volume described by the repulsive force of the 12 - 6 lennard jones potential . @xmath3 where the cutoff radius @xmath4 is set as @xmath5 .",

    "the elastic continuum surrounds the md cell including the cg polymer model and the elastic stress acts on the md cell . in the case of a constant - pressure md method @xcite , the constant pressure acts on the md cell .",
    "the constant pressure is replaced by the elastic stress of the continuum in the hybrid method as shown in fig.[hybrid ] .",

    "@xmath20 are the reduced displacements of the springs in volume units . @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the masses of the particles and the springs , and @xmath23 is the inertial mass for the motion of the volume @xmath14 , which is also presented in the standard constant - pressure md method @xcite .",
    "@xmath24 is the potential energy between the particles of the cg polymer model .",
    "the fourth term @xmath25 corresponds to the elastic potential energy of the first spring ( @xmath26 ) as is illustrated in fig.1(c ) .",

    "it is shown in fig.[re ] that the curve of @xmath57 obtained by the hybrid method at @xmath58 is consistent with that of the final equilibrium state .",
    "the curve obtained by the conventional method at @xmath58 is far from the equilibrium , and even at a simulation time of @xmath59 , it still does not converge to the equilibrium .",
    "@xmath54 for long distances @xmath60 have statistical errors due to the small number of polymers ( 10 polymer chains in the present calculation ) .",
    "as the @xmath61 reaches chain length @xmath0 , there exist less and less pairs of monomers , and larger statistical errors .",
    "these errors are enhanced by the small number of polymer chains and are thus influencing the result for large @xmath61 .     and @xmath62 ) are shown . ]",
    "the fluctuation of the end - to - end distance @xmath41 of the hybrid model means that the chain structure of the polymer is fluctuating wildly during the simulation .",
    "the time convolution of the internal pressure of the cg polymer system and the volume of the md cell is shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ p_v ] that the internal pressure and the system volume are widely fluctuating .",
    "it can also be seen that the time convolution of the volume is out of phase with the internal pressure .",
    "these large - scale fluctuations arise in the polymer system ; low pressure induces a large expansion of the volume , and a large pressure compresses the system .",
    "hence the number density of the system is also widely fluctuating .    , and the constant - pressure md calculation is continued after that . ]",
    "these large fluctuations in the polymer system are generated by the vibrations of the springs .",
    "the motion of the springs is connected with that of the md cell as is described by equation [ eq8 ] .",
    "the large - scale dynamics of the elastic continuum leads to the fluctuation of the cg polymer system and results in the fast convergence to the equilibrium .",
    "if only small stress of the elastic continuum acts on the cg polymer system , the convergence is not improved .",
    "it is confirmed in fig .",
    "[ endtoend100 ] that a small vibration of the springs induces small fluctuations in the polymer system , and the convergence is not improved compared to the conventional method in this case .     and the internal pressure .",

    "the gray line indicates the result obtained in the case of a small fluctuation by the hybrid method , while the solid line indicates the result in the case of large - scale fluctuations . ]",
    "due to the large - scale fluctuations , the trajectory of the polymer spreads over a wide phase space and a wide range of energy .",
    "the present cg polymer model has a bending potential , which is closely associated with the chain structure and its flexibility .",
    "the probability distribution function of the bending potential is shown in fig .",
    "[ pdf ] . in the convensional method , an early state ( @xmath63 )",
    "is trapped in a limited local energy range around @xmath64 , which is separated from final equilibrium states of the energy around @xmath65 .",
    "in contrast , a much wider energy range is coverd by the hybrid method .",
    "this suggests that the hybrid method more easily allows us to overcome energetic barriers separating the initial state from the final equilibrium state .",
    "a large variety of chain structures is generated and its trajectory is over a much wider phase space than that of the conventional method .        in our previous studies@xcite ,",
    "a one - dimensional model was calculated by the hybrid method and the large - scale fluctuation causes the generation of a variety of phonons in the particle system .",
    "the phonons obtained by the hybrid model reproduced those by large - scale all - atom calculations .",
    "it was shown that the hybrid model enables us to extend the _ spatial scale _ to much larger values . in the present study ,",
    "the hybrid method is applied to the long - chain polymer that has very slow diffusion dynamics . the required simulation time to reach the equilibrium state of the polymer melt is reduced drastically .",
    "the present hybrid model thus enables us to reach a much wider _ time scale _ than that by the conventional md method .",
    "although the present model is simple , the hybrid method can be applied to more realistic and complex systems such as polycarbonate @xcite and protein molecules .",
    "the equilibrium structure and various properties at finite temperatures can be obtained with reasonable computational cost .",
    "we couple a cg polymer model and an elastic continuum using the hybrid method .",
    "the polymer melt consisting of the cg polymers is simulated and it is shown that fast convergence towards the equilibrium state of the polymer melt is achieved .",
    "the elastic continuum of the hybrid model acts on the polymer system and produces large scale fluctuations .",
