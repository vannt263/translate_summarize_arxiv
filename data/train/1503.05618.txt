    "white dwarfs ( wd ) are the typical endpoint of the evolution of most main sequence stars .",
    "because nuclear reactions do not occur in their deep interiors , the evolution of wds can be considered as a relatively simple and well understood gravothermal cooling process @xcite .",
    "actually , the evolutionary cooling times are now very accurate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , providing a reliable way of measuring the wd cooling age from the temperature and surface gravity measured observationally .",
    "wds are hence very useful tools in astronomy .",
    "for example , the wd luminosity function ( lf ) is an important statistical instrument which has been used not only to derive an accurate age of the galactic disk in the solar neighborhood @xcite but also to constrain the local star formation rate @xcite .",
    "moreover , the wd mass function ( mf ) has been successfully employed over the years as a tool to test the theory of stellar evolution , offering information on stellar mass loss .",
    "this function has also been used to study how the evolution of close binaries is able to produce low - mass wds @xcite , thus helping to asses the contribution of the distinct evolutionary scenarios in producing the current population of galactic binaries in which one of the components is a wd .",
    "finally , the wd age function ( af ) is also a valuable tool for constraining the wd formation history @xcite .    with the advent of modern , large - scale surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ?",
    "* ) or the super - cosmos sky survey @xcite , the size of the current observational wd samples has increased dramatically .",
    "this has allowed producing more accurate lfs , mfs and afs @xcite . however , the major drawback of most studies is the complicated target selection algorithms , which incorporate observational biases that are almost impossible to quantify in numerical simulations that aim at reproducing the ensemble properties of the observed samples .",
    "significant observational efforts have also allowed to unveil the population of wds within 20pc of the sun @xcite .",
    "this sample is considerably less numerous than those mentioned above , however it is claimed to be reasonable complete and can therefore be considered as a volume ( rather than magnitude ) limited sample , which suffers effectively from no selection biases .",
    "the lamost ( large sky area multi - object fiber spectroscopic telescope ) spectroscopic survey of the galactic anti - center ( lss - gac ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) follows a well - defined selection criteria aiming at providing spectra for stellar sources of all colours in the galactic anti - center ( including wds ) so that they can be studied in a statistically meaningful way .",
    "lss - gac started operations in 2011 and will provide a significantly larger sample of wds than those within 20pc of the sun . in this paper",
    "we derive preliminary observed lf , mf and af of wds identified within the first data release of lss - gac , and use a state - of - the - art monte carlo population synthesis code adapted to the characteristics of the survey to simulate the wd population in the galactic anti - center .",
    "we apply the lss - gac selection criteria to the simulated samples , carefully evaluate all possible observational biases , and derive synthetic lfs , mfs and afs .",
    "this exercise allows us to perform a meaningful comparison between the outcome of simulations and the observational data .",
    "lamost is a quasi - meridian reflecting schmidt telescope located at xinglong observing station in the hebei province of china @xcite .",
    "the effective aperture of lamost is about 4 meters .",
    "lamost is exclusively dedicated to obtain optical spectroscopy of celestial objects .",
    "each `` spectral plate '' refers to a focal surface with 4,000 auto - positioned optical fibers to observe spectroscopic plus calibration targets simultaneously , equally distributed among 16 fiber - fed spectrographs .",
    "each spectrograph is equipped with two ccd cameras of blue and red channels that simultaneously provide blue and red spectra of the 4,000 selected targets , respectively .",
    "the lss - gac is a major component of the lamost galactic survey @xcite . by selecting targets uniformly and randomly in ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) and ( @xmath4 , @xmath6 ) hess diagrams @xcite ,",
    "the lss - gac main survey aims at collecting @xmath73,700  9,000 low resolution ( @xmath8 ) spectra for a statistically complete sample of @xmath9million stars of all colours down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath1017.8mag ( 18.5mag for limited fields ) , distributed in a contiguous sky area of over 3,400 deg@xmath11 centered on the galactic anti - center ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) .",
    "the simple yet non - trivial target selection of the survey makes possible to study the underlying stellar populations for any given type of target , such as wds .",
    "in addition to the main survey , the lss - gac also includes a survey of the m31/m33 area , targeting hundreds of thousands of objects in the vicinity fields of m31 and m33 , and a survey of very bright ( vb ) plates , targeting over a million of randomly selected very bright stars ( @xmath14mag ) in the northern hemisphere during bright / grey nights .",
    "targets for the lss - gac main survey are selected for spectroscopic follow - up from the xuyi schmidt telescope photometric survey of the galactic anti - center ( xstps - gac ) catalogue @xcite .",
    "the xstps - gac survey was initiated in october 2009 and completed in march 2011 .",
    "photometry in sdss @xmath15 , @xmath4 and @xmath16 bands was acquired with the xuyi 1.04/1.20 m schmidt telescope located at the xuyi station of the purple mountain observatory , p.r.china .",
    "the xstps - gac surveyed an area of about 5,400deg@xmath11 , from @xmath17 to 9@xmath18 and @xmath19 to + 60@xmath20 to cover the lss - gac main survey footprint , plus an extension of @xmath21deg@xmath11 to the m31 , m33 region to cover the lss - gac m31/m33 survey area .",
    "the resulting catalogues contain about 100 million stars down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath22mag ( @xmath23 ) , with an astrometric calibration accuracy of 0.1arcsec @xcite and a global photometric calibration accuracy of @xmath242 per cent ( * ? ? ?",

    "most of the stars are from the b plates .",
    "the raw data were reduced with the lamost 2d pipeline ( version 2.6 ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , following the standard procedures of bias subtraction , cosmic - ray removal , 1d spectral extraction , flat - fielding , wavelength calibration , and sky subtraction .",
    "the lamost spectra are recorded in two arms , 3,700 ",
    "5,900  in the blue and 5,700  9,000  in the red .",
    "the blue- and red - arm spectra are processed independently in the 2d pipeline and joined together after flux calibration .",
    "flux calibration for the lss - gac observations is performed using an iterative algorithm developed at peking university by @xcite , achieving an accuracy of about 10 per cent for the whole wavelength ranges of blue- and red - arm spectra . a detailed description of the target selection algorithm , survey design , observations , data reduction , and value - added catalogs of the first lss - gac data release is presented in @xcite . in the current work we only consider spectra obtained by the main lss - gac survey . a list including the names of the plates employed for the main survey is provided in tablea1 ( see appendix ) .",
    "in this section we describe our methodology for identifying wds within the lss - gac spectroscopic data base .",
    "we do this following two independent but complementary routines .",
    "the first identifies wds by @xmath29-template fitting all lss - gac spectra , the second selects wds by applying a well - defined colour cut to the xstps - gac photometric catalogue .",
    "we also estimate the spectroscopic completeness of the lss - gac wd sample .",
    "we use the @xmath29-template fitting method described by @xcite to identify lss - gac wds .",
    "this routine was originally developed to search for sdss wd - main sequence binaries ( wdms ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however its mathematical prescription can be easily implemented to the lss - gac data for identifying single wds . as the first step",
    ", a given wd template is used to fit the entire lss - gac spectroscopic data base and the resultant reduced @xmath30 values are recorded .",
    "those @xmath30 , together with the overall s / n ratios of the lss - gac spectra are represented in a 2d map and an equation of the form ,      is defined so that all systems below this curve ( @xmath32 ) are considered as wd candidates , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are free parameters defined for each template .",
    "an example is illustrated in fig.[f - chi ] .",
    "the form of eq.(1 ) is defined to account for systematic errors between template and observed spectra , which become more important the larger the s / n is .",
    "the particular shape of the curve is carefully evaluated for each template as a compromise between the number of excluded / selected spectra . in other words , we aim at selecting as many wd candidate spectra as possible of similar spectral features as the templates used ( note that , strictly speaking , the only free parameter we are considering in the fitting process is the normalization factor ) .",
    "however , the number of selected targets can not be too large , as otherwise the automatization becomes useless .",
    "the spectra of all wd selected candidates are then visually inspected and systems that are not wds are simply excluded .",
    "this exercise is repeated for all wd templates considered . in this case ,",
    "our templates are the result of adding artificial gaussian noise to 45 da ( hydrogen - rich ) carefully selected wd model spectra provided by @xcite that cover a broad range of wd effective temperatures ( 6,000k-60,000k ) and surface gravities ( 7 @xmath359dex ) .",
    "the model spectra were binned to the lss - gac resolving power .",
    "four of our considered wd templates are shown in fig.[f - temp ] .",
    "obviously , using only da wd templates restricts our search to hydrogen - rich wds .",
    "however , as we show below ( section[s - compl ] ) , the number of non - da wds currently observed by the lss - gac is rather small .",
    "moreover , it has to be stressed that the presence of a small fraction of non - da wds does not seem to influence significantly the shape of the lf @xcite",
    ".    as already mentioned , lss - gac spectra are the result of combining a blue and a red optical spectrum obtained from two separate arms . given that single wds are blue objects , in principle ,",
    "the blue arm spectra alone should allow us to efficiently identify such stars . to investigate this",
    ", we separately applied the above described routine to all blue - arm lss - gac spectra as well as to all combined ( blue- and red - arm ) spectra and compared the results .",
    "we found that the number of identified wds differed significantly .",
    "specifically , we identified @xmath36 per cent more objects using the combined , blue plus red , spectra .",
    "moreover , all wds identified using only the blue - arm spectra were included in the list of targets found using the combined lss - gac spectra .",
    "the overall shape of the continuum spectrum is hence required for efficiently selecting single wds .",
    "we found this effect to be most important when selecting wds against hot ( a ) main sequence stars in which the strengths of the balmer lines are similar .",
    "this was also the case when selecting wds amongst low s / n ( @xmath37 ) spectra .",
    "for these two reasons , we decided to only consider the combined lss - gac spectra of s / n ratio above 5 in this work .",
    "this excluded 15,442 lss - gac spectra for which the default 2d pipeline ( section[s - gac ] ) failed to deliver usable red- and/or blue - arm spectra .",
    "it also excluded 622,112 spectra of s / n ratios below 5 .",
    "this requirement is further supported by the fact that reliable stellar parameters ( necessary for obtaining reliable lf , mf and af ) can not be derived for low s / n ratio wd spectra @xcite .",
    "thus , the total number of lss - gac spectra considered in this work was 306,600 , of which 20,029 were selected as wd candidates by our @xmath29-template fitting method . a visual inspection revealed that 94 of those are genuine wds , 81 of da type ( see table[tab : numbers ] ) .",
    "we also identified 26 wdms binaries . with the exception of j080357.21",
    "+ 334138.6 , these binaries are already included in the lamost wdms binary catalogue by @xcite .      in the previous section we searched for da wds by @xmath29-template fitting all lss - gac spectra . here",
    "we complement this with an independent strategy based on xstps - gac @xmath15 , @xmath4 and @xmath16 photometry ( section[s - gac ] ) .",
    "this exercise relies simply on applying a well - defined cut to the xstps - gac @xmath38 and @xmath39 colours ( see table1 of @xcite and fig.[f - colcut ] of this paper ) .",
    "@xcite provide two additional colour cuts , using the @xmath40 and @xmath41 magnitudes respectively , however these are not used here because the xstps - gac does not provide magnitudes in those filters .",
    "16,824 sources fall within the area defined by our cut and visual inspection of spectra of those targets confirms 78 as wds , of which 70 are das  see table[tab : numbers ] .",
    "the vast majority of the remaining targets are single a , f main sequence stars whose colours overlap with those of cool wds .",
    "the contamination by quasars is negligible as these sources are generaly too faint to be observed by the lss - gac survey .",
    "63 ( 57 ) of these 78 ( 70 ) wds ( das ) are already discovered following the above described @xmath29-template fitting method .",
    "thus , the colour method adds 15 new objects ( 13 of which are das ) to our sample .",
    "the total number of lss - gac wds thus raises to 105 , and among them we classify 90 as da wds ( table[tab : numbers ] ) .",
    "the complete lss - gac da wd sample is provided in tablea2 ( see appendix ) .",
    "two important conclusions can be drawn from the above exercise .",
    "first , the @xmath29-template fitting method failed to identify @xmath42 per cent of the whole lss - gac da wd sample . visual inspection of the spectra of those systems revealed that they were either of low s / n ratios ( @xmath43 in the blue - arm spectra ) , or were subject to artifacts of a bad flux calibration / merging of the two - arm ( blue plus red ) spectra , or a combination of both .",
    "although those effects clearly affect the identification of da wds when applying the @xmath29-template fitting method , they do not influence the colour selection of da wds .",
    "secondly , the da wd colour cut we applied missed @xmath44 per cent of the whole da wd sample identified .",
    "a closer inspection revealed the @xmath15 magnitudes of these targets to be unreliable .",
    "this caused those objects to fall far from the colour locus expected for da wds ( see fig.[f - colcut ] ) .",
    ".[tab : numbers ] number of wds ( including das , dbs , etc . ) and das alone identified by the @xmath29-s / n template fitting and colour methods , in common by the two methods , independently by each method , and missed by both methods . the total number of lss - gac wds and das are provided in the last row .
