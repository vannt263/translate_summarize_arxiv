    "recently time  reversal ( t ) violation has been measured in the @xmath4 system @xcite .",
    "however , the origin of t violation , as well as cp violation which also has been obtained experimentally in @xmath4 meson system , remains unclear . in the standard model ( sm )",
    "both violations comes from a phase of the cabibbo - kobayashi  maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite .",
    "it is well known that sm predicts sizeable cp violation in the @xmath5 meson system ( see @xcite ) .",
    "detecting cp violation constitutes one of the main research directions of the working b meson factories @xcite .",
    "these machines have already provided the first evidence for cp violation in b system , namely @xmath6 @xcite . in search of other sources of cp violation one",
    "needs to investigate new processes . in this work",
    "we study the t  violating effects in the baryonic @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) decays using the most general form of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "large number of @xmath9 baryons are expected to be produced in tevatron , lhc , etc .",
    ", which is a great opportunity to examine the sm predictions for various decay modes of @xmath9 .",
    "these decays are also very sensitive to the new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the interest to baryonic decays can be attributed to the fact that only these decays can give valuable information about the handedness of the quarks . it should be noted that t  violating effects in the @xmath2 and @xmath10 decays were studied in the supersymmetric model in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "it is well known that for a general three  body decay the triple spin",
    " momentum correlations @xmath11 are t ",
    "odd observables , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the spin and momenta of final particles .",
    "so , in order to organize t ",
    "odd quantities we have two possibilities :    * either we choose lepton polarization as the polarization of final particles , or * we choose only @xmath1 baryon polarization .    in the @xmath7 decay ,",
    "experimentally only one polarization state of the particles can be measured . in principle",
    "one can use either polarization of the lepton or polarization of the baryon in studying t  odd observables . the first possibility , i.e. , the lepton polarizations in the @xmath7 decay was studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the present work we prefer choose the second possibility , namely , @xmath1 baryon polarization in investigating the t  violating effects .",
    "it should be noted here that , lepton polarization effects for the @xmath10 were studied comprehensively in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , using the most general , model independent form of the effective hamiltonian , we derive the expression for the t",
    " odd transverse polarization of @xmath1 .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the numerical analysis and concluding remarks .",
    "the matrix element of the @xmath14 decay at quark level is described by the @xmath15 transition . the decay amplitude for the @xmath15 transition , in a general model independent form ,",
    "can be written in the following way ( see @xcite )    [ e1 ] + c_lr^tot |s_l ^b_l |_r _ _ r + c_rl |s_r ^b_r |_l _ _ l + c_rr |s_r ^b_r |_r _ _ r + c_lrlr |s_l b_r |_l _ r + c_rllr |s_r b_l |_l _",

    "+ i c_te ^ |s _ s _ }  , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the chiral operators and @xmath18 are the coefficients of the four  fermi interaction .",
    "part of these wilson coefficients and structures does already exist in the effective hamiltonian of the @xmath19 transition in the sm .",
    "the first two of the coefficients @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the nonlocal fermi interactions which correspond to @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the sm , respectively .",
    "the following four terms describe vector type interactions .",
    "two of these vector interactions containing the coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath25 do also exist in the sm in the forms @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "therefore @xmath24 and @xmath25 represent the sum of the combinations from sm and the new physics in the following forms [ e2 ] c_ll^tot c_9^eff- c_10 + c_ll  , + c_lr^tot c_9^eff+ c_10 + c_lr  .",
    "the terms with @xmath28 and @xmath29 describe the scalar type interactions .",
    "the last two terms in eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) correspond to the tensor type interactions .",
    "the amplitude of the exclusive @xmath30 decay can be obtained by sandwiching the matrix element of the @xmath31 decay between initial and final state baryons .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) that , in order to calculate the amplitude of the @xmath14 decay the following matrix elements are needed [ e3 ] & & |s _ ( 1 _ 5 ) b _ b  , + & & |s _ ( 1 _ 5 ) b _ b  , + & & |s ( 1 _ 5 ) b _ b  .",
    "explicit forms of these matrix elements in terms of the form factors are presented in appendix  a of @xcite . using the parametrization of these matrix elements ,",
    "the matrix form of the @xmath14 decay can be written as [ e4 ] + i _ q^+q _ ] u__b +    4 c_t |^ |u_u__b + 4 c_te ^ | _",

    "explicit expressions of the functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 are given in appendix  a of @xcite .",
    "obviously , the @xmath14 decay introduces a lot of form factors .",
    "when the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) has been used , the heavy quark symmetry reduces the number of independent form factors to two only @xmath37 and @xmath38 , irrelevant with the dirac structure of the relevant operators @xcite , and hence we obtain that [ e5 ] ( p _ ) |s b ( p__b ) = |u_u__b  , where @xmath39 is an arbitrary dirac structure , @xmath40 is the four  velocity of @xmath9 , and @xmath41 is the momentum transfer .",
    "comparing the general form of the form factors with ( [ e5 ] ) , one can easily obtain the following relations among them ( see also @xcite ) [ e6 ] g_1 f_1 = f_2^t= g_2^t = f_1 + f_2  , + g_2 f_2 = g_3 = f_3 = g_t^v = f_t^v =  , + g_t^s f_t^s = 0  , + g_1^t f_1^t = q^2  , + g_3^t m__b + m _  , + f_3^t - m__b - m _  , where @xmath42 .",
    "these relations will be used in further numerical calculations .    as has already been stated , in order to study the t  violating effects , we need spin polarization of @xmath1 baryon . spin vector @xmath43 of @xmath1 baryon can be expressed in terms of the unit vector @xmath44 along the @xmath1 spin in its rest frame as , [ e7 ] s_= , +  , and choose the unit vectors along the longitudinal , transversal and normal components of the @xmath1 polarization to be [ e8 ] _",

    "@xmath44 along @xmath1 baryon can be written in the following form [ e9 ] = _ 0  , where @xmath49 corresponds to the unpolarized differential decay rate , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath0 represent the longitudinal , normal and transversal polarizations of @xmath1 , respectively . the unpolarized decay width in eq .",

    "after lengthy and straightforward calculations , we get the following expression for @xmath57    [ e12 ] + 8 m__b + m_m__b + 8 m_m__b + 16 m_m__b ( [ d_1^(c_t+c_te ) f_t^v ] - [ d_1^c_te f_t^v ] ) + 8 m",

    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ e12 ] ) that , for @xmath0 to have nonvanishing value ,    * interactions of new type must exist , and , * combinations of different wilson coefficients must have a weak phase .",
    "it should be noted that in the sm @xmath58 ( see @xcite ) and hence it is strongly suppressed .",
    "for this reason , if a large value for @xmath0 is measured in the experiments , it could be considered as an unambiguous indication of the existence of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "it should be remembered that the electromagnetic interaction of final particles can induce @xmath0 , but this contribution is negligibly small , which is of the order of @xmath59 .",
    "in this section we will investigate the sensitivity of the transversal lepton polarization to the new wilson coefficients .",
    "the main input parameters in eq .",
    "( [ e12 ] ) are the transition form factors . for transition form factors we will use the results from qcd sum rules approach in combination with hqet @xcite , which reduces the number of form factors into two independent ones",
    ". the dependence of these form factors on @xmath60 can be expressed as [ e13 ] f(q^2 ) =  , where parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 are listed in table 1 .",
    "@xmath63    in further numerical analysis , for the values of the wilson coefficients @xmath64 , and @xmath65 we will use next  to leading order logarithmic approximation results at renormalization point @xmath66 @xcite . it should be noted that , in addition to the short distance contribution , @xmath67 also receives long distance contributions from the real @xmath68 resonant states of the @xmath69 family . in the present work we do not take into account the long distance effects .",
    "furthermore in carrying out numerical calculations we vary all new wilson coefficients in the range @xmath70 .",
    "the experimental bounds on the branching ratio of the @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xcite suggest that this is the right order of magnitude range for the vector and scalar interaction coefficients .",
    "moreover we assume that tensor interactions also vary in this region .",
    "as we have already noted , in order to obtain considerably large value for @xmath0 , the new wilson coefficients must have weak phase .",
    "for simplicity we assume that all new wilson coefficients have a common weak phase @xmath73 .",
    "it follows from the explicit expression of @xmath0 that it depends on @xmath60 , magnitude and phase of the new wilson coefficients .",
    "the dependence of @xmath0 is eliminated by performing integration over @xmath60 , i.e. , we analyze the averaged @xmath0 , which is defined as [ e14 ] p_t =  .",
    "the dependence of the averaged @xmath3 on the wilson coefficients @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath29 and on the phase @xmath73 for the @xmath79 decay is presented in figs .",
    "( 1)(6 ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath76 and on the weak phase for the @xmath80 decay is depicted in fig .",
    "( 7 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath3 on the remaining wilson coefficients @xmath81 and @xmath82 for the @xmath83 decay is not presented since for all these choices @xmath3 is negligibly small ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "it can easily be seen from these figures that @xmath3 attains at its largest value for @xmath76 about @xmath85 , for @xmath86 , for @xmath87 , for @xmath78 , @xmath29 about @xmath88 and about @xmath89 for @xmath74 for the @xmath90 decay .",
    "the situation for the @xmath91 decay is similar to the previous case .",
    "it is observed that @xmath92 displays even stronger dependence only on @xmath76 and reaches its maximum value of @xmath93 , and for @xmath74 about @xmath94 , while for all remaining wilson coefficients other than these two @xmath95 is negligibly small ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "these behaviors can be explained as follows . in the massless lepton limit ( neglecting scalar type interactions for simplicity )",
    "the expression for @xmath0 reduces to [ e15 ] p_t & ~ & \\ { a [ c_br^c_rr - c_rl- c_sl^2 c_10+c_lr - c_ll ] + b [ c_rl^+c_rr^ 2 c_10+c_lr - c_ll+ 2 c_9 + c_lr+c_llc_rr^-c_rl^ ] }  , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are functions of @xmath60 and ratio of the form factors . in this work",
    "we will assume that @xmath21 and @xmath20 are defined in the same way as in the sm , since the measured branching ratio of @xmath99 decay is in a very good agreement with the sm prediction @xcite@xcite .",
    "the first term in eq .",
    "( [ e15 ] ) can safely be neglected since @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "we also observe that the expression in eq .",
    "( [ e15 ] ) involves @xmath77 and @xmath76 in the combinations of the form & & ~[c_rr^c_10 + c_9^eff ]  , + & & ~[c_rl^c_10 - c_9^eff ]  .in the sm @xmath65 and @xmath67 have opposite signs and have almost equal magnitudes ( see for example @xcite ) , which explains the reason why @xmath0 gets larger values for @xmath76 compared to the other new wilson coefficients .",
    "for all other choices @xmath0 is proportional to the lepton mass and for this reason @xmath0 is quite small the coefficients @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "finally we would like to discuss briefly the detectibility of @xmath104 in the experiments . experimentally , to measure @xmath3 of a particular decay with the branching ratio @xmath105 at the @xmath106 level , the required number of events are @xmath107 .",
    "for example , if @xmath108 then , to measure @xmath109 at @xmath110 level , @xmath111 @xmath9 decays are required . since at lhc and",
    "btev machines @xmath112 pairs are expected to be produced per year @xcite , the detectibility of @xmath92 is quite high in these colliders .    99    cplear collaboration , a. angelopoulos _ et .",
