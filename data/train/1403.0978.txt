    "a spin glass ( sg ) is a complex system characterized by both quenched randomness and frustration , which lead to the irreversible freezing of spins to states without the long - range spatial order below the glass transition temperature ( @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "theoretical approaches for understanding sg transitions are generally concerned with the study of mean - field level calculations performed using infinite - range interaction models , of which the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model @xcite is a prototype .",
    "some infinite - range interaction sg models have recently sparked interest in relation to the so - called inverse transitions .    since tammann s hypothesis @xcite a century ago , there has been substantial interest in a different class of phase transitions known as inverse transitions ( melting or freezing ) . in these phase transitions ,",
    "an ordered phase is more entropic than a disordered one , whereby the ordered phase may appear at a higher temperature than the disordered one .",
    "such inverse transitions have already been observed experimentally in physical systems such as of liquid crystals @xcite , polymers @xcite , high-@xmath1 superconductors @xcite , magnetic thin films @xcite , and organic monolayers @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , from a theoretical point of view , there have been various attempts to identify a suitable model for inverse transitions .",
    "spin - glass models have been suggested to be candidates for inverse freezing , wherein the sg phase becomes one with higher entropy .",
    "the ghatak - sherrington ( gs ) model @xcite is a spin-1 spin - glass model with a crystal field and it is especially well known as a prototypical sg model for inverse freezing @xcite .    in ordinary sg systems , in general , the second - order phase transition from paramagnetic ( pm ) to sg occurs as temperature is decreased .",
    "however , according to crisanti and leuzzi @xcite , there seems to be a second reentrance as well as inverse freezing in the gs model .",
    "( see fig . 2 in refs .",
    "this implies that phase transitions are likely when the phase is varied successively in the order pm @xmath2 sg @xmath2 pm @xmath2 sg as the temperature is reduced . in other words",
    ", there seems to exist two different sgs , i.e. , a sg in the higher - temperature region [ higher - temperature spin glass ( htsg ) ] and a sg in the lower - temperature region [ lower - temperature spin glass ( ltsg ) ] .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the theoretical validity for the existence of such separated sgs using a simple gs - like model .    for this purpose , we study a quantum version of the gs model by adding a transverse tunneling field , similar to the manner in which the quantum version of the sk model has been studied by considering quantum tunneling with a transverse field @xcite .",
    "we expect the quantum gs model to clarify the changes in the existence and features of the two sgs with respect to the transverse field .",
    "herein we use one - step replica symmetry breaking ( 1rsb ) for theoretical investigations instead of the replica symmetry ( rs ) @xcite and the full replica symmetry breaking ( frsb ) @xcite .",
    "we select the 1rsb because it provides more physically meaningful results than rs does and numerical values of order parameters more easily than frsb does .",
    "although 1rsb is approximated with respect to the exact frsb ansatz , it is a good approximation around transition lines because at criticality the thermodynamics is not very sensitive to the ansatz chosen , as shown in refs .",

    "when @xmath75 is larger than 1.015 , there exists only one sg phase , instead of the two separated sg phases .",
    "since schupper and shnerb @xcite focused on the inverse freezing of the gs model , they selected large values of @xmath75 ( e.g. , 6.0 ) . in order to observe sg splitting ,",
    "however , it is better to select @xmath75 values smaller than 1.0 because when the degeneracy of the empty states of @xmath9 ( @xmath14 ) is larger than one of the filled states of @xmath9 ( @xmath13 ) , the pm phase gap generating the sg splitting becomes wider .",
    "in the present work , we proposed an expanded spin - glass model , the quantum gs model , in order to obtain more meaningful evidence for the second reentrance observed in the gs model . by obtaining the 1rsb solutions of the quantum gs model , we could check the detailed pm - sg phase boundaries depending on the crystal field @xmath7 and the transverse field @xmath8 .",

    "the htsg and ltsg show certain differences in shape and phase boundaries .",
    "such sg splitting becomes more distinctive when @xmath75 is less than 1 .",
    "we verified that the empty states of @xmath9 are thus crucial for the occurrence of sg splitting .",
