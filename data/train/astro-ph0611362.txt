    "gro j1411 - 64 is the strongest variable unidentified mev source located near the galactic plane .",
    "it was dicovered by comptel / cgro during 1995 march - july ( viewing periods 414 - 424 ) , during which the source went on a burst event at mev energies ( zhang et al .",
    "the source was detected at @xmath2 7@xmath0 in the 1 - 3 mev band by combining the 7 viewing periods ( vps , the periods of observations in cgro ) , according to which the best location was measured at ( l , b ) = ( 311.5@xmath3 , -2.5@xmath3 ) and the source was referred as gro j1411 - 64 .",
    "the _ flare duration _ was several months and the rather steep spectral shape obtained while the source was flaring would predict a bright , hard x - ray source , if there is no break in the spectrum , which is explored here . in",
    "what follows , we present the results of the integral observations of this source , as well as of xmm - newton observation of its best location and , followingly , the comment concerning the possible nature of this source .",
    "gro  j1411 - 64 was observed by integral during 2004 december 30 - 2005 january 6 . in total , 102 science windows ( scws ) were carried out to have 210 ks of effective exposure .",
    "data reduction was performed using the version 5.0 of the standard offline science analysis ( osa ) software , and the spectra were fitted with xspec of ftools 5.3.1 .         and upper limit 2 @xmath0 .",

    "i d : 0204010101 ) .",
    "the data were pipeline - processed with the xmm - newton science analysis software ( sas ) version 6.1 .",
    "after removal of background flares , a total of 15.8 , 15.8 and 14.6 ks of good data survived for mos1 , mos2 and pn respectively .",
    "no hint of signal was found for new hard x - ray sources within the location uncertainty of gro  j1411 - 64 from individual scws of the integral instruments . to improve the statistics ,",
    "mosaic maps were obtained for ibis/ isgri and jemx by combining all data .",
    "the images of ibis/ isgri were produced in the energies 20 - 100 kev , see fig . 1 for the map in the 20 - 40 kev band as an example .",
    "the circle holds the 4-@xmath0 error region of gro  j1411 - 64 obtained by comptel during its flare in 1995 ( zhang et al .",
    "2002 ) . from the possible counterparts of gro  j1411 - 64 discussed in zhang",
    "et al.s paper ( 2002 ) , only the circinus galaxy shows up in this error region as seen by integral .",
    "the most significant detection of circinus galaxy is in the energies 20 - 40 kev , at a confidence level of 38@xmath0 .",
    "the mosaic map of jemx shows no significant source feature is visible from within the 4-@xmath0 error region . for spi ,",
    "the circinus galaxy is at the 6@xmath0 level in the 20 - 40 kev range , and it is the only source detected within the location of gro  j1411 - 64 , the region of our search .",
    "the light curve for the circinus galaxy , detected mainly by ibis / isgri , is rather constant .",
    "the circinus galaxy was investigated by soldi et al .",
    "models of cutoffpl plus wabs in xspec can fit the data well , with a reduced @xmath4 of 1.1 ( 7 dof ) .",
    "the resulting parameters are consistent with those in soldi et al .         upper limits . ]",
    "gro  j1411 - 64 shows likely persistent emission in 0.75 - 1 mev band during its low state ( fig .",
    "2 ) , where the source was detected at @xmath5 by comptel ( fig.3 ) .",
    "the corresponding spectrum of the low state can be represented by a power law shape with spectral index 2.5@xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . circinus galaxy can be safely ruled out as the counterpart due to its spectral extrapolation well below the ones at mev energies .",
    "the isgri / spi upper limits combined to spectra of both flare / low states shows the existence of a maximum in the power output at hard x - rays , which might remind us to consider the microblazar as the possible source nature .",
    "a total of 31 x - ray sources were formally detected by the sas source detection algorithm in the epic data .",
    "nine of these were excluded due to detector defects and other artifacts , in a careful inspection .",
    "the resulting 22 reliable and statistically significant sources ( likelihood @xmath1 ) are shown in fig .",

    "the hard excess exhibited by the xmm - newton data is apparent in that figure , and might be suggestive of a large compton bump that would peak in the several @xmath7 kev region , fitting well with the comptel detections .",
    "however , the fact that the xmm - newton image does not cover the full comptel source location and the non - detection by integral of any reliable counterpart , would make the assumption that xmmu j141255.6 - 635932 is the counterpart to gro j1411 - 64 , although spectrally consistent , only tentative and risky .",

    "the observations , subsequent analysis and theoretical investigations pursued shed light upon the nature of gro j1411 - 64 .",
    "the combined integral , xmm - newton and comptel observations reveal no obvious counterpart at high energies ( hard x - rays and gamma - rays ) .",
    "nevertheless , the unique peak of the power output at these energies resembles the sed seen in microquasars , and suggests at work by a similar scenario .",
    "however , an analysis using a microquasar model consisting on a magnetized conical jet filled with relativistic electrons which radiate through synchrotron and inverse compton scattering with star , disk , corona and synchrotron photons shows that it is hard to comply with all observational constrains ( fig .",

    "this fact and the non - detection at hard x - rays introduce an a - posteriori question mark upon the physical reality of this source .",

    "glast observations would help improving the location of the mev source if radiation at higher energies is not completely suppressed , and would open the door for more efficient multiwavelength searches of the counterpart .",
    "however , it is true that the nature of this comptel source might not be constrained further if this detection was a one - time only transient phenomena .",
    "glast will only be able to help if a candidate counterpart is caught in the act ( flaring / quiescent state of an agn or a more rare galactic object ) .",
    "having at hand glast observations , in any case , will make our currently reported investigation to naturally fit into the testing of any hypothesis on the nature of gro j1411 - 64 .",
