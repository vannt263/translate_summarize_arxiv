    "the reversed anisotropy in the susceptibility of @xmath41 is observed@xcite , indicating that the cef ground state has changed from the @xmath20 states to other states .",
    "although the susceptibility can not be fit well , it is natural to assume the cef ground state for the doped system as @xmath42 , because the estimated splitting from the ground state @xmath20 is small in the undoped system ( cepd@xmath2al@xmath3 ) .",

    "the magnetic order is considered to be influenced by the orbital anisotropy of the @xmath9 electrons , which is reflected in the susceptibility anisotropy , and also by the conduction - band structures .",
    "we obtain the conduction - band structures of cepd@xmath2al@xmath3 from the band calculation using abinit@xcite for the non-@xmath9 counterpart system , in which la are substituted for ce . in the band calculation , we adopt the troullier - martins pseudopotential@xcite , and the exchange - correlation term is determined according to perdew and wang@xcite .",

    "this sequence is in good agreement with the observed one for ce(pd@xmath0m@xmath1)@xmath2al@xmath3 with increasing @xmath10 . in order for the theoretical results to correspond with the experimental ones quantitatively , it is required to shift @xmath10 by approximately + 0.1 , which corresponds to the change of the conduction - electron number by 0.2 .    to dissolve this discrepancy",
    ", it must be allowed to assume a small change in the conduction - band structures . if the 18th conduction band , which are thoroughly unoccupied in our band calculation as plotted in fig .",
    "[ figdos ] , are lowered so that it possesses small electron fermi surfaces with the filled electron number @xmath247 , we may obtain effectively smaller electron filling numbers for the 16th and 17th bands . under this modification in the conduction - band structures , we can relate the @xmath5-af order for @xmath248 ev , the f order in the vicinity of @xmath202 , and the @xmath12-af order for @xmath249 ev to the af order of cepd@xmath2al@xmath3 , the f order of ce(pd@xmath0m@xmath1)@xmath2al@xmath3 for @xmath7 , and the af order for @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath5-af order is caused by the rkky interaction through the structure of the 16th conduction band , while the @xmath12-af order is due to the 17th band , and the f order is caused by the crossover from the 16th to the 17th band .",
    "finally , we discuss the justification of the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) . in our model ,",
    "the stable magnetic order is determined mainly by the signs of the rkky interaction between the neighboring ce sites .",
    "therefore , the stable ordering vector will not alter substantially even if the approximation is improved beyond the mfa , but the transition temperature will be largely changed . as a conclusion ,",
    "the mfa is sufficient inasmuch as the relative stability between the various magnetism is concerned .",
    "a calculation based on an improved approximation is left in a future issue .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the variation of the ordering vectors of ce(pd@xmath0m@xmath1)@xmath2al@xmath3 on the basis of the anisotropic rkky interaction model , using the realistic conduction - band structures obtained by the band calculation .",
    "it is understood that the conduction - band structures play an important role in determining the ordering vectors , in the way similar to the nesting effect in the hubbard model . by treating the substitution of ag or cu for pd atoms as the electron doping to the conduction bands of cepd@xmath2al@xmath3 , which are obtained from the band calculation",
    ", we have obtained the variation of the ordering vectors consistent with experimental results for ce(pd@xmath0m@xmath1)@xmath2al@xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath5-af order of cepd@xmath2al@xmath3 is caused by the movement of the iso - energy surface of the 16th band to the central plane of the fbz with increasing @xmath179 .",
    "on the other hand , the af order for @xmath11 is caused by the movement of the iso - energy surface of the 17th band , for which the ordering vector is predicted to be @xmath12 .",
    "the f order for @xmath7 is caused by the crossover of the main conduction band from the 16th to the 17th band .",
    "thus , we have obtained the variation of the ordering vectors with increasing @xmath63 , which is consistent with that for ce(pd@xmath0m@xmath1)@xmath2al@xmath3 , using the anisotropic rkky model with the realistic conduction - band structures .",
    "the numerical calculation has been carried out by the sx8 supercomputer in yitp , kyoto university .",
    "the conduction - band structures have been obtained through the use of the abinit code , a common project of the universite catholique de louvain , corning incorporated , and other contributors ( url http://www.abinit.org)@xcite .",
    "it relies on an efficient fast fourier transform algorithm@xcite for the conversion of wavefunctions between real and reciprocal space .",
