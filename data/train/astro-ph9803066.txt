    "new high resolution spectra are presented for the high - redshift @xmath2 lensed system behind a2390 .",
    "figure 1 shows a section of the spectrum aligned along the long axes of the two main arcs .",
    "this clearly shows that the ly@xmath1 emission is spatially - separated from the continuum light and redshifted with respect to the interstellar lines , indicating an outward flow of enriched gas thought to be typical of starburst galaxies ( lequeux et al .",
    "all stellar and interstellar features are common to both spectra , confirming these arcs are images of one single highly - magnified galaxy .",
    "note the ly@xmath1 absorption is seen only in the southern portions of both arcs , coincident with the stellar continuum and with no associated ly@xmath1 emission , indicating absorption of this line where the hi column is high . a lens model for this system",
    "is discussed in frye & broadhurst ( 1998 ) .",
    "keck infrared observations were also taken to study the stellar populations of this galaxy , by comparing flux ratios on opposite sides of the 4000   break ( bunker , et al .",
    "these proceedings ) .",
    "the famous ` straight ' arc was first observed spectroscopically by pell , et al .",
    "1991 at z=0.913 .",
    "the straightness and length of this arc led to difficulties in finding a reasonable lens model ( kassiola , et al .",
    "we present here new keck spectra taken along this arc confirming the known redshift , z=0.913 , but also revealing that the redshift of component a of this arc ( in the notation of pell et al ) is in fact an unrelated galaxy at z=1.033 .",
    "thus the straight arc comprises two unrelated galaxies , close in projection .",
    "interestingly , low ionization metal lines are found at @xmath3 against the spectrum of the higher redshift galaxy , indicating an extended gaseous halo around this lower redshift galaxy , similar to the halos detected against bright qsos ( bergeron , et al .",
    "1992 , steidel , et al .",
    "1994 , churchill , et al . 1996 ) as shown in figure 3 .",
    "two - dimensional spectrum of two arcs at z=4.040 , taken along the long axes of the arcs .",
    "the northern and southern components extend 5 and 3 arcsec above and below the central cluster elliptical , the bright white central strip .",
    "the blue end is at the left hand side of the chip and the pixel scale is 0.21 arcsec / pix .",
    "ly@xmath1 emission , seen in each component as a bright spot in the blue is spatially separated from the broad clearly visible continuum and the damped ly@xmath1 absorption .",
    "high resolution keck spectra of two arcs at z=4.040 ( 8 resolution ) .",
    "the upper two panels show the spectra of the southern and northern arcs .",
    "( see fig .",
    "the interstellar lines of siii , oi , cii , and siiv are clearly seen in both images , used in determining the redshift .",
    "these metal lines lie blueward of the centroid of the ly@xmath1 emission by 300km / s .",
    "this behavior is common to all high quality high redshift and local starburst galaxy spectra and indicates global outflow of gas .",
    "keck spectra taken at two different positions along the straight arc .",
    "two unrelated galaxies are found at z=0.913 and z=1.033 , corresponding to components c and a respectively ( in the notation of pell , et al .",
    "in addition interstellar lines of mgii and feii at the redshift of component c are seen in absorption towards the higher redshift component a ( indicated by dashed lines extending downward into the middle panel ) , evidence for an extended gaseous halo ."
