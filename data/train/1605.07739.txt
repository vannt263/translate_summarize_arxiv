    "since the method we use to measure the transit noise of atoms has not been used previously , it allows us to investigate the validity of the standard basic physics principles , which we feel is important and was also done here .",
    "furthermore , a new method of measurement can open up new approaches to understanding atom photon interactions .",
    "we expect this conceptually simple method to bring about further insight into their properties .",
    "our approach of measuring transit noise is applicable to any atoms or molecules , regardless of the density , pure or mixed , as long as a resonant light source is used . in particular , properties of atoms in buffer gas and rubidium atoms have played an important role in various active areas of fundamental fields of study in physics , such as atomic clocks@xcite , bose einstein condensation of cold atoms@xcite , as well as some applications to other fields@xcite .",
