    "this implies that orbits starting on the arc @xmath233 move toward the arc @xmath169 .",
    "but this gives rise to a contradiction , in fact for these orbits we have @xmath230 , they can not accumulate to a point somewhere in the generalized quadrilateral with vertices @xmath235 , @xmath244 , @xmath23 and @xmath236 because the origin is the only fixed point , thus they must intersect the limit cycle somewhere between points @xmath229 and @xmath23 , which is impossible because the system is autonomous and cauchy s uniqueness and existence assumptions are guaranteed .",
    "let us take a limit cycle , @xmath245 , and consider its homothetic by a factor @xmath246 .",
    "take a point @xmath247 and its homothetic one @xmath248 , let @xmath237 be the straight line passing through these two points .",
    "comparing again the slopes , as we did in  , we get : @xmath249 for all @xmath250 and @xmath251 . here",
    "the equal sign appears because we are considering also @xmath252 .",
    "hence trajectories starting on @xmath253 will go inward and accumulating to @xmath245 .",
    "similarly , considering @xmath254 homothetic of @xmath245 by a factor @xmath255 , and comparing again slopes we will obtain that @xmath245 is internally attracting .",
    "this proves that @xmath245 is globally hyperbolic , hence unique ."
