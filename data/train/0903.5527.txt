    "in the last few years the number of discussed matter contents for the different ages of our universe has increased . besides the original dust , radiation and cosmological constant terms ,",
    "researchers have come to include other contributions to the right - hand side of einstein equations , being quintessence and phantom energy some of the most usual .",
    "the consideration of these new terms has been motivated by the attempts of explaining the experimentally inferred accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of these new matter contents , which do not satisfy some of the classical energy conditions , has as a consequence the appearance of new types of singularities which did not come up in former models , such as big rip @xcite and sudden singularities @xcite , and other non - singular features , such as bounces or extremality events .",
    "all of these have been comprised under the name `` cosmological milestones '' by catton and visser @xcite together with the classical big bag and big crunch singularities .    in that paper",
    "the authors perform a classification of flrw cosmological models in terms of the first coefficients of a generalised puiseux expansion of the scale factor in time coordinate around one of these cosmological milestones .",
    "these coefficients are used to determine violations of energy conditions and appearance of polynomial scalar curvature singularities and derivative curvature singularities .",
    "generically the classification depends on just the first three exponents of the puiseux expansion .",
    "what we would like to do now is to complete the classification by considering other definitions of singularities .",
    "geodesic incompleteness is commonly accepted as an indicator of the existence of a singularity in a space - time @xcite and may happen even in cases where there is no polynomial scalar curvature singularity .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that even in the cases where a causal geodesic is incomplete , this does not mean that finite objects are necessarily crushed on approaching the singularity .",
    "these are considered weak singularities . in our classification",
    "we take into account this fact with the most common definitions of strong singularities .",
    "this involves calculation of causal geodesics in the corresponding space - times .",
    "this topic is reviewed in section [ sec2 ] . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "geodesic equations are solved for the power expansion of the scale factor and the differentiability of the geodesics is analysed . finally , in section [ sec4 ]",
    "the strength of the singularities , if any , is discussed in relation to the values of the exponents of the power expansion .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "more details about this issue may be found in @xcite .",
    "generally calculation of geodesics in a space - time is a cumbersome task , since it requires solving a system of four ordinary quasilinear differential equations .",
    "geodesics are parametrised by their proper time , @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the components of the metric tensor of the space - time in the coordinate chart provided by @xmath2 .",
    "proper time is defined up to a change of scale and origin , @xmath3 , and hence it is also called affine parameter .",
    "we denote by a dot derivatives with respect to proper time .",
    "a geodesic is said to be complete if it can defined for all values of @xmath4 . on the contrary",
    ", it is said to be incomplete in the past ( future ) if it can be extended just to a value @xmath5 instead of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "geodesics are defined as the curves @xmath8 on the space - time for which the length functional , @xmath9=\\int_{s_{0}}^{s_{1 } } ds,\\quad ds^2=-d\\tau^2=g_{ij}dx^idx^j,\\ ] ] has a extremum .",
    "the corresponding euler - lagrange equations , @xmath10 may be written in terms of the christoffel symbols for the metric tensor , @xmath11 plus an additional equation , @xmath12 which simply states that we are using proper time as parameter .",
    "the constant @xmath13 takes value one for timelike , zero for lightlike and minus one for spacelike geodesics .",
    "we use spherical coordinates , @xmath14 , with the usual ranges and @xmath15 is coordinate time .",
    "geodesics are therefore described providing @xmath16 .    in the case of flrw cosmological models ,",
    "@xmath17 the large number of isometries allows us a quick integration of geodesic equations .    since the space - time is homogeneous and isotropic , geodesics are straight lines and hence we may restrict the discussion to a plane @xmath18 , @xmath19 , choosing as origin of coordinates one of the points of the geodesic .    furthermore , changing the radial coordinate to @xmath20 it is easy to check that @xmath21 is another generator of isometries and therefore @xmath22 is conserved along geodesics .",
    "we are left then with just one equation , @xmath23 and the quadrature @xmath24 which may be integrated after solving the equation in @xmath15 and therefore need not be considered here .    at this point",
    "it is clear that all information about the geodesics is encoded in the scale factor @xmath25 .",
    "we consider just future - pointing geodesics , @xmath26 .    without losing much generality , we assume that the expansion , @xmath27 where the exponents @xmath28 are real and ordered",
    ", @xmath29 is valid close to a cosmological milestone at @xmath30 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath31 must be positive in order to have a positive scale factor .",

    "is required for the analysis of singularities , we focus only on lightlike and timelike geodesics .",
    "lightlike geodesic equations are straightforwardly integrated , @xmath41    at lowest order , @xmath42    since generically @xmath15 behaves as a power @xmath43 of proper time , different levels of regularity appear depending on the value of @xmath33 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for @xmath33 lower or equal than minus one , lightlike geodesics do not reach the cosmological milestone at @xmath30 , since it would take them an infinite proper time to reach it .",
    "they therefore do not see the singularity .",
    "this limiting case , which corresponds to a model with @xmath44 when the universe is flat , has been named superphantom and considered in @xcite .",

    "another definition is due to krlak @xcite , for which the singularity is strong if the derivative of the volume is negative close to the singularity . obviously , if a singularity is strong according to tipler s definition , it is strong according to krlak s , but not conversely .",
    "these definitions are meant to be used for gravitational collapse and therefore do not consider the possibility of big rip singularities . but these may be included in the framework just reversing a sign .",
    "both definitions have been written in an amenable form by clarke and krlak @xcite in terms of integrals of riemann components along the geodesics .    in our case",
    "the situation is even much simpler since the space - time is conformally flat and the weyl tensor vanishes .",
    "for instance , a lightlike geodesic meets a strong singularity , according to tipler s definition , at proper time @xmath5 if and only if @xmath75 diverges as @xmath4 tends to @xmath5 .",

    "however , lightlike geodesics do not reach the big rip singularities for exponents @xmath33 lower or equal than minus one .    the results of catton and visser in @xcite are more restrictive , since they do not deal with the strength of the curvature singularities . for them",

    "the only models which are free of such singularities are those with @xmath39 and natural exponents @xmath28 , @xmath112 and those with @xmath92 , @xmath94 , @xmath93 and natural exponents @xmath113 , @xmath112 .    this is not surprising , since derivatives of the curvature tensor do not appear in our equations .    however , the main difference between both results arises from the fact that curvature singularities do not see that lightlike geodesics do not reach the singularity in finite proper time .",
    "though this classification of singularities conveys the idea of ubiquous singularities in flrw cosmological models , it is worthwhile mentioning that singularities mostly appear in models with vanishing , divergent or non - smooth scale factors .",
