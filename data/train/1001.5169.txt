    "we present here the notes of three lectures given by one of us at the xviii international fall workshop on geometry and physics in benasque .",
    "the course considers some aspects of tomographic mappings , a vast and very active area of different applications of integral geometry .    as a motivation , we start with the physical problem of the tomographic imaging of a two dimensional body by the measurements of the intensity attenuation of a beam of particles passing through it",
    ". then , we will introduce the radon transform , which is the key mathematical tool for reconstructing the tomographic map of both the wigner quasi - distribution of a quantum state and the probability distribution on the phase space of a classical particle .",
    "the original transform was introduced by j.  radon @xcite , who proved that a differentiable function on the three - dimensional euclidean space can be determined explicitly by means of its integral over the planes .",
    "we will consider the straightforward generalization of the radon transform to codimension - one hyperplanes in @xmath0 and will study its main properties .",
    "moreover , we will prove the original radon inversion formula , by making use of potential theory .",
    "we will then look at a first generalization of the radon transform : the @xmath1-transform which , roughly speaking , is defined on a larger space .",
    "we will show how it can be inverted very easily by using the fourier transform .",
    "then , we will unveil the relation between radon and @xmath1 , thus exhibiting an alternative , much simpler inversion formula .",
    "then , we will consider a broader framework and look at the more general problem of expressing a function on a manifold in terms of its integrals over certain submanifolds .",
    "this has become an important topic in integral geometry with many applications ranging from partial differential equations , group representations , and x - ray technology .",
    "the focus will be on invariant ( or equivariant ) transformations under some symmetry groups from the space of functions on one geometrical space to the space of functions on another geometrical space .",
    "we will also exhibit two examples that can be framed in the above setting and work out their respective inversion formulae : the radon transform on codimension-@xmath2 planes and the john transform on unit spheres in @xmath3 .",
    "we will then show a simple mechanism that allows to generalize the radon transform , and its inverse , to more general families of codimensione - one submanifolds . as examples",
    ", we will look at two families of curves in the plane : the family of all circles passing through a fixed point and at the family of all equilateral hyperbolas with one fixed asymptote .",
    "finally , we will show how the above techniques can be used in the quantum case .",
    "a straightforward generalization derives from the phase - space description of quantum mechanics through wigner quasi - distribution functions .",
    "we will see how the homodyne detection scheme can be considered as the weyl quantization of the radon transform .",
    "there is a huge literature on tomography and it is impossible to be complete in the references .",
    "we apologize in advance for any shortcomings in this respect .",
    "there are several classical references : we suggest for a group - theoretic approach the book by helgason @xcite and for the connection with partial differential equations the book by john @xcite .",
    "additional general references are gelfand and shilov @xcite and strichartz @xcite . finally , for an up - to - date overview of the many applications of the radon transform",
    "we refer to the book by deans @xcite , which includes also an english translation of the 1917 paper by radon , that announced the transform s discovery .",
    "consider a body in the plane @xmath4 , and consider a beam of particles ( neutrons , electrons , x - rays , etc . ) emitted by a source .",
    "assume that the initial intensity of the beam is @xmath5 .",
    "when the particles pass through the body they are absorbed or scattered and the intensity of the beam traversing a length @xmath6 decreases by an amount proportional to the density of the body @xmath7 , namely @xmath8 so that @xmath9 a detector placed at the exit of the body measures the final intensity @xmath10 , and then from @xmath11 one can record the value of the density integrated on a line . if another ray with a different direction is considered , with the same procedure one obtains the value of the integral of the density on that line .",
    "see fig [ detector ] .",
    "the mathematical model of the above setup is the following : given a normalized positive and smooth function @xmath12 , namely @xmath13 and @xmath14 define for all possible lines @xmath15 in the plane @xmath4 the quantity @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the euclidean measure on the line @xmath15 . in this way",
    ", we have defined an operator @xmath18 that maps a smooth function @xmath19 on the plane @xmath4 into a function @xmath20 on @xmath21 , the manifold of the lines in @xmath4 . along with the transform @xmath22 , it is convenient to consider also the dual transform @xmath23 which to a function @xmath24 on @xmath21 associates the function @xmath25 on @xmath4 given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the measure on the compact set @xmath28 which is invariant under the group of rotations around @xmath29 and for which the measure of the whole set is @xmath30 .     using its signed distance @xmath31 from the origin and a unit vector @xmath32 perpendicular to the line.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we ask the following question : if we know the family of integrals @xmath33 , can we reconstruct the total density function @xmath19 ?",
    "the answer is affirmative and in the following we will see how to obtain this result .    in order to write the integral ( [ sharp lambda ] ) in a more convenient form , let us parameterize @xmath34 in the following way @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the ( signed ) distance of the line @xmath15 from the origin , and @xmath37 is a unit vector perpendicular to @xmath15 .",
    "this means that the cartesian equation of @xmath15 is @xmath38 by considering a pair @xmath39 of cartesian axes associated to the line @xmath15 , where @xmath31 is parallel to @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is perpendicular to @xmath40 , we obtain the following parametric equation for @xmath15 @xmath42 see fig . [",
    "fig : radon 2d ] . with a little abuse of notation",
    ", we have @xmath43 that is called the _ radon transform _ of @xmath19 .",
    "observe that the ( [ eq : doublecovering ] ) is a double covering of @xmath34 , because the pairs @xmath44 and @xmath45 correspond to the same line @xmath15 .",
    "however , one has @xmath46 and thus @xmath20 depends only on the line @xmath15 and not on its parameterization .",
    "let us generalize the above definitions to the case of a @xmath47-dimensional space .",
    "let @xmath19 be a function defined on @xmath0 , integrable on each hyperplane in @xmath0 and let @xmath48 be the manifold of all hyperplanes in @xmath0 .",
    "the radon transform of @xmath19 is defined as follows @xmath49 where @xmath17 is the euclidean measure on the hyperplane @xmath15 .",
    "thus we have an operator @xmath18 , the _ radon transform _ , that maps a function @xmath19 on @xmath0 into a function @xmath20 on @xmath50 , namely @xmath51 .",
    "its dual transform , also called _ back projection operator _ , @xmath23 associates to a function @xmath24 on @xmath50 the function @xmath25 on @xmath0 given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the unique probability measure on the compact set @xmath54 which is invariant under the group of rotations around @xmath29",
    ".     using its signed distance @xmath31 from the origin and a unit vector @xmath40 perpendicular to @xmath15.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    let us consider the following covering of @xmath48 @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the unit sphere in @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the equation of the hyperplane @xmath15 is @xmath57 with @xmath58 denoting the euclidean inner product of @xmath59 .",
    "[ fig : radon nd ] . observe that the pairs @xmath60 are mapped into the same hyperplane @xmath61 .",
    "therefore ( [ double covering ] ) is a double covering of @xmath48 .",
    "thus @xmath48 has a canonical manifold structure with respect to which this covering mapping is differentiable .",
    "we thus identify continuous ( differentiable ) functions @xmath24 on @xmath48 with continuous ( differentiable ) functions @xmath24 on @xmath62 satisfying @xmath63 .",
    "we will work in the schwartz space @xmath64 of complex - valued rapidly decreasing functions on @xmath0 .",
    "we recall that @xmath65 if and only if @xmath66 and for all multiindices @xmath67 and @xmath68 results @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes the euclidean @xmath29 , and @xmath71    in analogy with @xmath64 we define @xmath72 as the space of @xmath73 functions @xmath24 on @xmath62 which for any integers @xmath74 and any differential operator @xmath75 on @xmath56 satisfy @xmath76 the space @xmath77 is then defined as the set of @xmath78 satisfying @xmath79 .    if @xmath65 its radon transform ( [ sharp lambda1 ] ) can be written in a simple way , by using the dirac @xmath80 distribution , as @xmath81 in the same way if @xmath82 one has @xmath83 using ( [ radon transform nd ] ) and ( [ flat ] ) it is easy to check the duality relation between the radon transform @xmath18 and its dual @xmath84 , namely for every @xmath65 and @xmath82 one gets @xmath85 indeed , @xmath86    now , consider a unit vector @xmath87 .",
    "we define _ the tomogram of @xmath19 along @xmath40 _ the function @xmath88 physically , this means that we fix a direction @xmath40 and we look at the variation of the intensity of all the rays that interact with the body in that direction .",
    "we also define the family @xmath89 of tomograms associated to @xmath19 .",
    "the following result shows how the radon transform maps a joint probability density function @xmath19 of @xmath47 random variables into a family of probability density functions @xmath89 of a random variable .",
    "let @xmath65 be a nonnegative and normalized function , namely @xmath90 then , for all @xmath87 it results that @xmath91    let us fix @xmath87 .",
    "observe that for all @xmath36 @xmath92 moreover , @xmath93    the radon transform has a peculiar behavior under translation .",
    "given a displacement @xmath94 , consider the translation operator defined by @xmath95 one has the following property    [ lm : translation ] let @xmath96 and @xmath94 .",
    "then for any @xmath97 @xmath98    by setting @xmath99 we get @xmath100    the following lemma , which is the infinitesimal version of lemma  [ lm : translation ] , shows how the radon transform and its dual intertwine the laplacian on @xmath0 , @xmath101 with the laplacian on @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "let @xmath96 and @xmath104 .",
    "then @xmath105    by lemma  [ lm : translation ] we get @xmath106 therefore , by considering an orthonormal basis @xmath107 of @xmath0 , for all @xmath108 and @xmath87 one has that @xmath109 and thus @xmath110 therefore , since @xmath87 , by summing over @xmath111 we have the first equality in ( [ eq : intertwine ] )",
    ".    as for the second relation , observe that @xmath112 whence @xmath113 therefore , @xmath114    the radon transform is closely connected with the fourier transform .",
    "let us recall some basic facts about the fourier transform .",
    "for any function @xmath115 with @xmath116 , we define its fourier transform as @xmath117 with @xmath118 .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that the fourier transform is a bijection of @xmath119 onto itself , and its inverse reads @xmath120 in short , for any @xmath115 , one has that @xmath121 . using standard duality arguments the fourier transform can be extended to the space of temperated distributions @xmath122 ( and thus also to its subspace of square summable functions @xmath123 , where it can also be proved to be unitary ) . in particular , we recall that @xmath124 and thus @xmath125    we will show that the @xmath47-dimensional fourier transform of a function @xmath19 on @xmath0 is the @xmath30-dimensional fourier transform of its tomogram @xmath126 for all @xmath97 . this result is known as the _ fourier slice theorem_.    [ r - f ] consider @xmath65 , @xmath127 and @xmath87",
    ". then @xmath128    the thesis follows immediately from the definitions .",
    "indeed @xmath129    now we will address the problem of the range of the radon transform with domain @xmath64 .",
    "the following lemma is crucial .",
    "[ homogeneous ] if @xmath65 , then for any integer @xmath130 and any @xmath131 , the integral of its tomogram , @xmath132 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath133 in the cartesian components @xmath134 .",
    "this is immediate from the relation @xmath135    in accordance with this lemma we define the space @xmath136 as follows : @xmath137 if and only if @xmath82 and for any integer @xmath130 the integral @xmath138 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath133 in @xmath134 .",
    "the radon transform is a linear one - to - one mapping of @xmath64 onto @xmath136 .",
    "[ th : radonbijection ]    the proof uses the well - known fact that the fourier transform maps @xmath64 onto itself and lemma   [ homogeneous ] . for more details",
    "see @xcite . in the next section",
    "we will give a constructive proof , by explicitly exhibiting the inverse mapping .",
    "now we want to obtain the inversion formula , namely we want to prove that one can recover a function @xmath19 on @xmath0 if all its tomograms @xmath89 are known . in order to get this result",
    "we need three preliminary lemmata .",
    "[ sharp flat ] let @xmath65 and @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 .",

    "is the potential at @xmath29 generated by the charge distribution @xmath19.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the physical meaning of lemma  [ sharp flat ] is the following : if @xmath19 is a charge distribution , then the potential at the point @xmath29 generated by that charge is exactly @xmath153 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] .",
    "notice , however , that the potential of a point charge scales always as the inverse distance _",
    "independently _ of the dimension @xmath47 , and thus it is coulomb only for @xmath154 .",
    "the only dependence on @xmath47 is in the strength of the elementary charge @xmath143 .",
    "this fact will be crucial in the following : we will see that the associated poisson equation involves an @xmath47-dependent ( fractional ) power of the laplacian .",
    "[ lm : hatv ] let @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 .",

    "[ lm : anbn ] let @xmath143 and @xmath156 as in lemmata  [ sharp flat ] and [ lm : hatv ] .",

    "( [ eq : andef ] ) of lemma  [ sharp flat ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath169 and the thesis follows .",
    "now we are ready to prove the inversion formula for the radon transform .",
    "let @xmath65 .",
    "then @xmath170 where @xmath171 , with @xmath172 , is a pseudodifferential operator whose action is @xmath173    first of all observe that if @xmath174 statement ( [ inversion formula ] ) is trivial , so assume that @xmath175 .",
    "let @xmath176 , we get by lemma   [ sharp flat ] @xmath177 so that , if @xmath178 , we have @xmath179 therefore , again by lemma [ sharp flat ] , we have @xmath180 from ( [ an bn1 ] ) we get the inversion formula ( [ inversion formula ] ) .",
    "equation  ( [ inversion formula0 ] ) says that , modulo the final action of @xmath181 , the function @xmath19 can be recovered from its radon transform @xmath182 by the application of the dual mapping @xmath84 : first one integrates over the set of points in a hyperplane and then one integrates over the set of hyperplanes passing through a given point .",
    "explicitly we get @xmath183 which has the following remarkable interpretation .",
    "note that if one fixes a direction @xmath87 , then the function @xmath184 is a plane wave , i.e.  a function constant on each plane perpendicular to @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ inversion formula ] ) gives a representation of @xmath19 in terms of a continuous superposition of plane waves .",
    "a well - known analogous decomposition is given by fourier transform .",
    "when @xmath154 , one recovers the inversion formula originally found by radon @xcite @xmath185      now we consider the following question on the localization properties of the radon transform : given a function @xmath19 can we reconstruct it in a compact region @xmath186 , using only the tomograms of @xmath19 on hyperplanes @xmath15 that pass through @xmath186 ? by looking at the inversion formula ( [ inversion formula ] ) one would naively think that the answer be positive . by following a nice argument given by john @xcite",
    ", we will show that in fact this can not be true in two ( and , in general , even ) dimensions .",
    "the reason is the well - known fact that waves can not be localized in two dimensions : a pebble dropped in a pond produces ripples that propagate along expanding disks . on the other hand , in one dimension waves",
    "remain localized : a local perturbation of the pressure in an organ pipe propagates by translating its support .",
    "this is a fortunate accident that allows us to enjoy a bach s fugue without hearing an endless annoying echo of each tune .",

    "let us fix a time @xmath191 .",
    "the solution to this equation is given by the celebrated poisson s formula @xcite @xmath192 where @xmath193 denotes the gradient in @xmath4 .",
    "therefore the support of @xmath194 is a subset of @xmath195 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we consider the radon transform of ( [ wave equation ] ) we get , for every @xmath87 , a cauchy problem for the wave equation in @xmath102 @xmath196 observe that @xmath197 has its support in @xmath198 . the solution of eq .",
    "( [ wave equation rt ] ) is @xmath199 thus the function @xmath200 has its support in @xmath201 .",
    "so we see that if one wants to reconstruct the function @xmath194 in the set @xmath202 one can not consider only the tomograms on the lines that intersect @xmath202 , because they are all equal to zero .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : localization ] .",
    "indeed , from @xmath203 for @xmath204 we have that @xmath205 on the other hand , the inversion formula ( [ inversion formula ] ) for @xmath206 yields @xmath207 the seeming contradiction derives from the fact that the pseudodifferential operator @xmath208 is nonlocal .",
    "in fact , by ( [ eq : fractionallap ] ) it is an integral operator that depends also on the values of @xmath209 for @xmath210 . of course , this is a peculiar behavior of the even dimension .",
    "for odd @xmath47 in the inversion formula ( [ inversion formula ] ) we have an integer power of the laplacian that is a _ bona fide _ differential operator and thus is local .",
    "in this section we introduce another covering of the homogeneous space @xmath48 that uses an additional parameter , which is absent in the classical tomographic framework of radon .",
    "this choice of parametrization of @xmath48 gives an easier inversion formula , although this approach is completely equivalent to that considered in the previous section .",
    "we define the following covering @xmath211 where the cartesian equation for @xmath15 is @xmath212 of course the additional parameter with respect to radon is @xmath213 .",
    "now , if @xmath65 we can define the @xmath1-transform of @xmath19 as follows @xmath214 this tomographic mapping was introduced by manko and marmo , who gave seminal contribution towards its significance @xcite . also for this transform we can define the tomograms , precisely for every @xmath215 we define @xmath216 .",
    "it easy to check that also this transform maps a probability density on @xmath0 into a family of probability density functions @xmath102 , namely if @xmath65 is a positive and normalized function , then for all @xmath215 , @xmath217 is positive and normalized .",
    "let us now consider the relations between radon and @xmath1 transform .",
    "obviously , from @xmath218 one can immediately recover @xmath219 by setting @xmath220 : @xmath221 however , notice that , although @xmath20 is the restriction of @xmath222 to the unit sphere @xmath56 , there is actually a bijection between the two transforms .",
    "therefore , they carry exactly the same information .",
    "indeed , since the dirac distribution is positive homogeneous of degree @xmath223 , i.e.  @xmath224 ) @xmath225 for @xmath226 . in words , the tomogram @xmath218 at a generic point @xmath215 is completely determined by the tomogram at @xmath227 . but the latter is nothing but the radon transform , by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ff0 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we get the bijection @xmath228    finally , let us look at an inversion formula as in the case of the radon transform .",
