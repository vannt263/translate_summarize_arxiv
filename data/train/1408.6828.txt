    "games of cyclic dominance play a prominent role in explaining the intriguing biodiversity in nature @xcite , and they are also able to provide insights into darwinian selection @xcite , as well as into structural complexity @xcite and prebiotic evolution @xcite .",
    "cyclical interactions have been observed in different ecological systems .",
    "examples include marine benthic systems @xcite , plant systems @xcite , and microbial populations @xcite .",
    "cyclic dominance also plays an important role in the mating strategy of side - blotched lizards @xcite , the overgrowth of marine sessile organisms @xcite , the genetic regulation in the repressilator @xcite , and in explaining the oscillating frequency of lemmings @xcite and of the pacific salmon @xcite .",
    "the list of examples where the puzzle of biological diversity can be explained by the interaction topology of the food web among those who struggle for life is indeed impressively long and inspiring @xcite .",
    "in addition to the closed loops of dominance in the food webs that govern the evolution of competing species and strategies , experiments have shown that the key to the sustenance of biodiversity is often spatial structure . in vitro experiments with _ escherichia coli _ , for example , have shown that arranging the bacteria on a petri dish is crucial for keeping all three competing strands alive @xcite . on the other hand , in vivo experiments with bacterial colonies in the intestines of co - caged mice , which can be considered as locally well - mixed populations , have revealed that mobility alone is sufficient to maintain coexistence @xcite . solely because the bacteria were able to migrate from one mice to another , the biodiversity was preserved .",
    "motivated by such intriguing experimental observations , theoretical explorations of the relevance of spatial structure in evolutionary games have also received ample attention in the recent past @xcite .",
    "the importance of spatial structure has been put into the spotlight by the discovery that interaction networks like the square lattice can promote the evolution of cooperation in the prisoner s dilemma game through the mechanism that is now known as network reciprocity @xcite .",
    "in essence , network reciprocity relies on the fact that cooperators do best if they are surrounded by other cooperators .",
    "more generally , the study of spatial games has revealed the need for realistic models to go beyond well - mixed populations @xcite . to understand the fascinating diversity in nature and to reveal the many hidden mechanisms that sustain it",
    ", we can not avoid the complexity of such systems .",
    "cyclical interactions are characterized by the presence of strong fluctuations , unpredictable and nonlinear dynamics , multiple scales of space and time , and frequently also some form of emergent structure . since many of these properties are inherent also to problems of nonequilibrium statistical physics , theoretical research on spatial rock - paper - scissors ( rps ) and related games of cyclic dominance",
    "has a long and fruitful history @xcite , much of which is firmly rooted in methods of statistical physics that can inform relevantly on the outcome of evolutionary games on structured populations .",
    "cyclical interactions are in many ways the culmination of evolutionary complexity , and they may also arise spontaneously in evolutionary games where the number of competing strategies is three or more .",
    "for example , cyclic dominance has been observed in public goods games with volunteering @xcite , peer punishment @xcite , pool punishment @xcite and reward @xcite , but also in pairwise social dilemmas with coevolution @xcite or with jokers @xcite .",
    "counterintuitive complex phenomena that are due to cyclic dominance include the survival of the weakest @xcite , the emergence of labyrinthine clustering @xcite , and the segregation along interfaces that have internal structure @xcite , to name but a few examples .",
    "importantly , the complexity of solutions increases further and fast if the competing strategies are more than three .",
    "figure  [ web ] depicts a transition towards more and more complex food webs from left to right , which support the formation of defensive alliances @xcite and subsystem solutions @xcite that are not possible in the simplest rps game .",
    "although the outcome of evolutionary games with cyclic dominance may depend on the properties of the interaction network , the topology of the food web , and on the number of competing strategies , there nevertheless exists fascinatingly robust universal behavior that is independent of model particularities .",
    "while we may have only begun to scratch the surface of the actual importance of cyclic dominance in nature @xcite , the time is ripe for a survey of theoretical advances that may guide future experimental efforts .",
    "like by the evolution of cooperation @xcite , in games of cyclic dominance too the evolutionary game theory @xcite is proving to be the theory of choice for the study of these beautifully simple yet fascinating systems .",
    "the organization of this review is as follows . in section",
    "ii we focus on mean - field and zero - dimensional rps models to give a comprehensive prologue to the overview of the spatial rps game in section  iii . within the latter , we separately review the impact of different interaction networks and mobility , and we describe the derivation and the proper use of the complex ginzburg - landau equation to describe the spatiotemporal properties and the stability of the spiraling patterns . in section",
    "iv , we depart from the rps game where the cyclic dominance is explicitly encoded in the food web by considering social dilemmas and other evolutionary games .",
    "we separately review games where cyclical interactions emerge spontaneously , the role of time - dependent interactions , the impact of voluntary participation , and we survey evolutionary games where an alliance between two strategies acts as an additional independent strategy .",
    "from there , we focus on cyclical interaction between four and more competing strategies , which opens the door towards reviewing the emergence of defensive alliances and large networks of competitive species .",
    "we conclude with a summary and an outlook towards promising future research efforts .",
    "while the emphasis of this review is on cyclic dominance in structured populations , it is useful to start by considering the simplest setting to study rps games which is the mean field limit of well - mixed populations where all individuals can interact with each other .    a generic rps game between individuals of three species",

    "( [ dom1 ] ) corresponds to one species dominating and displacing another ( dominance - removal ) with rate @xmath7 , whereas in eq .",
    "( [ dom2 ] ) there is a zero - sum dominance - replacement with rate @xmath8 .",
    "recent experiments have shown that in addition to cyclic dominance , some species can mutate .",
    "for instance , _",
    "e.  coli _ bacteria are known to mutate  @xcite , and it was found that the side - blotched lizards _",
    "uta stansburiana _ are not only engaged in cyclic competition , but they can also undergo throat colour transformations  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore also instructive to assume that each species can mutate into one of the other species with a rate @xmath9  @xcite , according to @xmath10 additional evolutionary processes that should be specified are those encoding the movement of individuals .",
    "however , these are irrelevant in the absence of spatial structure and will therefore be introduced in the next section . in the mean field limit of population size @xmath11 ,",
    "the dynamics of the system evolving according to eqs .",
    "( [ dom1])-([mut ] ) is aptly described by the following rate equations for the densities @xmath12 of @xmath0 s , @xmath13 of @xmath1 s and @xmath14 of @xmath2 s : @xmath15+\\mu(b+c-2a)\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{d b}{d t } & = & b\\left[q\\rho_{\\emptyset } + z(c - a ) -pa\\right]+\\mu(a+c-2b)\\\\ \\frac{d c}{d t } & = & c\\left[q\\rho_{\\emptyset } + z(a - b ) -pb\\right]+\\mu(a+b-2c),\\nonumber % \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 denotes the density of empty sites .",
    "these rate equations admit a steady state @xmath17 in which @xmath18 and @xmath2 coexist at the same density @xmath19 encompass three types of oscillatory dynamics :    1 .   when @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the eqs .",
    "( [ re ] ) can be rewritten as the rate equations of the may - leonard model  @xcite . in this case , the above coexistence state is unstable and there are also three absorbing stationary states corresponding to the population being composed of only @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath2 . as in the may - leonard model ,",

    "when @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath24 , a supercritical hopf bifurcation arises at the value @xmath25 of the bifurcation parameter : the coexistence steady state is a stable focus when @xmath26 , while it is unstable when @xmath27 and the dynamics is thus characterized by a stable _ limit cycle _ of frequency @xmath28 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the state @xmath5 plays no role in the dynamics and one recovers the cyclic lotka - volterra model  @xcite . the sum and product of the densities , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ,",
    "are conserved by ( [ re ] ) which results in nested _ neutrally stable closed orbits _ around the coexistence fixed point which is a neutrally stable center  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the cyclic dominance - replacement scheme with asymmetric rates @xmath33 is also characterized by a marginally stable coexistence fixed point @xmath34 surrounded by neutrally stable orbits on which the mean field dynamics takes place , see fig .",
    "[ mf_portrait ]  @xcite .     in a well - mixed population .",

    "the red flow that erratically spirals out from the coexistence fixed point is a single trajectory obtained by simulating the stochastic dynamics in a finite population of size @xmath37 .",
    "this illustrates how demographic fluctuations are responsible for the extinction of two species ( here @xmath0 and @xmath2 ) after a time of order @xmath3 .",
    "see the main text for details , as well as @xcite , from where this figure is adapted . ]",
    "the evolution in well - mixed populations of finite size , @xmath38 is usually described in terms of birth - and - death markov chains , see e.g.  @xcite . in this case , the interactions between a finite number of discrete individuals lead to fluctuations that may drastically affect the dynamics . in particular , in the presence of absorbing states , fluctuations are responsible for the extinction of two strategies and the fixation of the surviving one , see fig .",
    "[ mf_portrait ]  @xcite .",
    "questions concerning the mean time necessary for two species to go extinct and the probability that one specific strategy survives have recently attracted significant attention and were mostly addressed by means of stochastic simulations .",
    "these are often efficiently carried out using the gillespie algorithm  @xcite : for instance , cyclic competition and reproduction according to eqs .",
    "( [ dom1])-([rep ] ) are implemented by allowing at each time increment a reproduction event with probability @xmath39 , a dominance displacement move with probability @xmath40 and a dominance replacement update with probability @xmath41 .",
    "when @xmath42 and @xmath22 and the mean field dynamics is characterized by heteroclinic cycles , the mean extinction time has been found to be of order @xmath43 .",
    "the existence of quantities conserved by the mean field dynamics allows some analytical progress in the case of cyclic dominance with replacement ( @xmath30 ) for which it was shown that two species die out after a mean time that scales linearly with the system size @xmath3  @xcite . in this class of models with asymmetric rates",
    ", it was also shown the survival probability follows an intriguing  law of the weakest \" : the strategy with the smallest dominance rate is the most likely to survive and to fixate the population  @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ mf_portrait ] .",
    "some other aspects of extinction in rps games in finite and well - mixed populations have been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and studied in further details in ref .",
    "in a structured population , or alternatively , in a spatial system , the interactions between players are defined by an interaction network and are thus limited . because players have only limited interactions with their neighbors , a strategy ( or species ) will not necessarily meet its superior ( or predator ) .",
    "this restriction has far - reaching consequences , because it enables pattern formation , and through that the survival of all three competing strategies with a time - dependent frequency akin to the red queen @xcite .",
    "for example , it is possible to observe propagating fronts and spiral waves between the competing strategies @xcite , which are particularly fascinating and complex if the invasion rates between different pairs of strategies are significantly different @xcite . in general , self - sustained oscillations of all three strategies",
    "are possible in spatially homogeneous populations @xcite and result from periodic dynamics around a long - lived metastable coexistence state whose life time is determined by the system size ( or the size of the population ) @xcite . hence ,",
    "if the system size is sufficiently large all possible combinations of invasion fronts appear , resulting in a time - independent constant frequency of strategies , depending only on the invasion rates between the three competing strategies .    in comparison to a well - mixed population , a spatial system allows us to introduce an additional microscopic process that has no effect if everybody interacts with everybody else , namely site exchange between strategies or between an individual player and an empty site .",
    "this gives rise to mobility , which arguably has a profound impact on the outcome of the rps game as it can both promote and impede biodiversity @xcite .",
    "in contrast to well - mixed systems , where as seen intrinsic noise can jeopardize the coexistence of species @xcite , depending on the level of mobility , species coexistence can be more easily maintained than under well - mixed conditions   @xcite and stochastic effects can have counterintuitive effects at some bifurcation point be reduced by stable patterns in spatial systems @xcite .",
    "the mentioned mixing of strategies ( directly or via empty sites ) can also influence the cyclic competition in aquatic media @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the degree of mixing determines the way of extinction , like the annihilation of domains , heteroclinic orbits , or traveling waves in a finite system @xcite .",
    "the rps game can also be regarded as a cyclical lotka - volterra model , and indeed it has been shown that a two - species lotka - volterra system with empty cites can give rise to global oscillations @xcite . in general , however , it is important to acknowledge that the structure of the interaction network and mobility can both have a significant impact on the evolutionary outcome of cyclical interactions , and in the following subsections we review this in more detail , as well as survey the usefulness of the complex ginzburg - landau equation .      in a structured population species should contact in real - space and their interaction is characterized by an appropriate graph .",
    "lattices are the simplest among these interaction networks , where every player has the same number of neighbors . by far",
    "the most widely used is the square lattice , although alternatives such as the honeycomb lattice , the triangular lattice , and the kagom lattice are frequently employed as well to study the relevance of the degree of players and the role of clustering .",
    "while the square and the honeycomb lattice both have the clustering coefficient @xmath44 equal to zero , the kagom and the triangular lattice both feature percolating overlapping triangles , such that their clustering coefficient is @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively . in general , lattices can be regarded as an even field for all competing strategies where the possibility of network reciprocity is given @xcite . furthermore , as there are many different types of lattices , it is possible to focus on very specific properties of cyclical interactions and test what is their role in the evolutionary process . in some cases , like by the competition of bacteria @xcite or for the description of parasite - grass - forb interactions @xcite , lattices are also an apt approximation of the actual interaction network . in more complex systems",
    ", however , the description of interactions requires the usage more intricate networks , which typically have broad - scale degree distribution and small - world properties @xcite .",
    "the question how the topology of the interaction network affects the outcome of cyclical interaction , and game theoretical models in general @xcite , is one of great interest .    as an initial departure from lattices towards more complex interaction topologies , it is possible to consider networks with dispersed degrees .",
    "as demonstrated by masuda and konno , the resulting heterogeneity can help to maintain the stable coexistence of species in cyclic competition @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to introduce permanent shortcut links that connect distant players , thereby effectively introducing small - world properties .",
    "in contrast to lattices , on small - world networks the frequencies of competing strategies oscillate even in the large system size limit , as shown @xcite .",
    "the explanation behind this observation lies in the fact that the introduction of shortcuts introduces quenched randomness into the interaction network . if the magnitude of this randomness exceeds a threshold value ,",
    "i.e. , if the number of shortcut links is sufficiently large , the amplitude of frequency oscillations can be so large that the system will always terminate into an absorbing state during the evolutionary process .",
    "these results lead to the conclusion that not only the limited interaction range that is imposed by structured populations , but even more so the explicit spatial distribution of competing species is the crucial property that determines coexistence and biodiversity @xcite .",
    "this observation becomes particularly interesting if we compare it with the observations made in the realm of spatial social dilemma games , where the limited interaction range was found to be the decisive factor for the promotion of cooperation based on network reciprocity @xcite .",
    "properties that are typical of small worlds can be introduced not only by means of permanent shortcut links between distant players , but also by means of temporary long - range links that replace nearest - neighbor links with probability @xmath47 .",
    "this process is typically referred to as annealed randomness @xcite .",
    "but while topological properties of annealed and quenched small worlds may be very similar , there is a relevant difference in the evolutionary outcomes of cyclical interactions taking place on them .",
    "namely , annealed randomness no longer gives rise to oscillatory frequencies of the three competing strategies in the rps game . for sufficiently large values of @xmath47 ,",
    "the oscillations are replaced by steady state behavior @xcite , as is commonly observed on regular lattices .",
    "interestingly , similar results were also reported for a four - strategy cyclic dominance game in @xcite .",
    "but as we will review later , the transitions between stationary and oscillatory states in cyclical interactions can in fact be driven by many different mechanisms , even if the interaction network thereby remains unchanged .",
    "the topology of the interaction network may also change as a result of a particular coevolutionary rule , as studied frequently before in the realm of social dilemma games .",
    "note that when not only individual strategy but also other player - specific character ( such as connectivity , strategy adopting- or passing capacity , etc . ) may change in time then we can observe parallel evolutions , co - evolution of strategies and other quantities , see @xcite for a review .",
    "in particular , rewiring could be the consequence of invasions between strategies @xcite .",
    "although games of cyclic dominance received comparatively little attention in this respect , there is a study by demirel et al .",
    "@xcite , which builds exactly on this premise .",
    "namely , the loser of each particular instance of the game can either adopt the winning strategy ( an invasion occurs ) , or it can rewire the link that brought the defeat .",
    "it was shown that nonequilibrium phase transitions occur as a function of the rewiring strength , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ demirel ] .",
    "the observation of the `` stationary @xmath48 oscillatory @xmath48 absorbing @xmath48 stationary '' phase transitions is conceptually similar to those observed in the realm of interaction networks with annealed randomness . in general , it is thus possible to conclude that oscillatory behavior in coevolving networks is a robust phenomenon  a conclusion which is further corroborated by agent - based simulations showing that coevolving networks can influence the cycling of host sociality and pathogen virulence @xcite .      as briefly explained above , besides the properties of the interaction network , mobility , as is the case in general for evolutionary game theoretical models @xcite , can also play a decisive role in the maintenance of biodiversity in games of cyclic dominance .",
    "the consideration of mobility has both theoretical and practical aspects . theoretically , the question is whether mobility affects the stability of spatial patterns that typically emerge in structured populations , and if yes , how ?",
    "from the practical point of view , it is important to acknowledge the fact that in real life prey and predators are frequently on the move in order to maximize their chances of survival .",
    "accordingly , their neighborhoods change , which is in agreement with the effect that is brought about by mobility in simulations . the crucial point to clarify",
    "is whether mobility simply shifts the evolutionary outcomes towards those observed in well - mixed populations , or whether there emerge unexpected phenomena that disagree with mean - field predictions . as we will review in what follows , the introduction of mobility in structured populations is certainly much more than simply a transition towards well - mixed conditions .",
    "pioneering work on the subject has been done by reichenbach et al .",
    "@xcite , who showed that mobility ( or migration ) has a critical impact on biodiversity .",
    "in particular , small mobility that is below a critical threshold promotes species coexistence , while large mobility that is above the threshold destroys biodiversity . behind",
    "these observations are spontaneously emerging spiral patterns , which in general sustain the coexistence of all three competing strategies @xcite . under the influence of mobility , however , the spirals grow in size , and above the critical threshold , they outgrow the system size causing the loss of biodiversity .",
    "accordingly , in @xcite it was thus argued that mobility can both promote and jeopardize biodiversity in rps games .    as most studies on this subject , in this section we will focus on rps games on two - dimensional square lattices of total size @xmath3 ( here , linear size is @xmath49 ) .",
    "the population s composition changes according to the dominance - removal reactions given by eq .",
    "( [ dom1 ] ) and reproduction reactions given by eq .",
    "( [ rep ] ) ( i.e. @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which yields degenerate heteroclinic cycles at mean field level ; see sec .",
    "[ non - spatial ] ) .",
    "furthermore , it is assumed that individuals can move by swapping their position with any neighbor at rate @xmath52 according to the scheme @xmath53 where @xmath54 . in many references",
    ", mobility is measured in continuum limit by introducing the mobility or diffusion coefficient @xmath55 where @xmath3 is the system size , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "to focus on the effects of mobility @xmath56 on pattern formation and biodiversity , the rate of competition @xmath7 and reproduction @xmath6 can initially be set fixed at @xmath57 .",
    "starting from random initial conditions where each lattice site is with equal probability either occupied by rock @xmath0 , paper @xmath1 , scissor @xmath2 or left empty , we find that the emerging spatial patterns depend sensitively on mobility . as shown in the top row of fig .",
    "[ mobandcom ] , as mobility increases from left to right , the characteristic scale of spiral waves increases as well .",
    "it was found that at a critical value of mobility , @xmath58 for @xmath59 , the length scale of the spiralling patterns outgrows the system size resulting in two species dying out and the dynamics settling in the absorbing of the remaining species  @xcite .",
    "the diversity is lost , whereby the extinction probability is defined as the disappearance of two species after a waiting time that is proportional with the system size .",
    "as the system size increases , this probability approaches zero if @xmath60 , and it tends to @xmath57 if @xmath61 .",
    "in contrast to mobility , competition promotes coexistence of species because the typical length of the spatial patterns decreases with increasing competition rate @xmath7 .",
    "this is illustrated in the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ mobandcom ] from left to right .",
    "macroscopic spiral waves emerge at @xmath62 , but they become smaller and fragmented as @xmath7 increases .",
    "the fragmentation is due to the fact that large competition rates introduce empty sites around small patches that contain all three competing strategies ( i.e. at the spiral core ) , which in turn leads to the disintegration of macroscopic spirals typically observed away from the core .",
    "the diversity is therefore favored at larger values of @xmath7 , as they effectively prevent the spirals outgrowing the system size .",
    "similar phenomenon can also be observed in the generic metapopulation model . in the latter case , however , the fragmentation is a consequence of the meeting of spiral fronts , as illustrated fig .",
    "[ ssa_different_mobilities ]  @xcite .",
    "since pattern formation obviously plays a critical role in warranting the coexistence of the three competing strategies , it is particularly important to understand how the spatial patterns evolve .",
    "prepared initial conditions are strongly recommended in such cases , as they can help identify critical processes that may either enhance or destroy the stability of coexistence .",
    "the emergence of spirals can be engineered if the evolution is initiated from three roundish areas , each holding a particular strategy , while the rest of the lattice is empty @xcite .",
    "based on such a procedure , it has been shown that there exists a critical competition rate @xmath63 below which single - armed spirals in finite populations are stable .",
    "for @xmath64 the spirals break up and form disordered spatial structures because too many empty sites allow the emergence of competing mini spirals @xcite .",
    "this transition is demonstrated in the top row of fig .",
    "[ spirals ] from left to right .",
    "although monte carlo simulations are applied most frequently for studying spatial evolutionary games ( see reviews @xcite and @xcite for details , and @xcite for the use of the spatial gillespie algorithm  @xcite ) , when density fluctuations are neglected , the dynamics of the spatial rps game on a domain of unit size can be described by the following of partial differential equations obtained by letting the lattice spacing @xmath65 vanish in the continuum limit @xmath11 : @xmath66 where @xmath67 labels the two - dimensional position , while @xmath68 and @xmath69 denote the density of empty site and the diffusion coefficient ( on a domain of unit size , @xmath69 coincides with @xmath56 ) , respectively .",
    "this set of partial differential equations can be solved numerically by standard finite difference methods , and as illustrated in the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ spirals ] , the results are similar to those obtained via monte carlo simulations .    by exploiting further the potential of prepared initial conditions , it is also possible to observe multi - armed spirals , as well as pairs of anti - spirals with a finite number of arms and pairs @xcite .",
    "we show examples of this fascinating pattern formation in fig .",
    "[ multispirals ] .",
    "an in - depth qualitative analysis reveals that such multi - armed spirals and anti - spirals are more robust to mobility that single - armed spirals , persisting not only at small but also at intermediate mobility rates .",
    "in addition to prepared initial conditions , periodic currents ( or localized forcing ) can also be applied to evoke specific spatial patterns . if a periodic current of all three strategies is applied at the center of the lattice , target waves can be observed , as reported in @xcite .",
    "such phenomena emerge due to the interplay between local and global system dynamics , in particular the intermittent synchronization between the periodic current and the global oscillations of the density of the three competing strategies on the spatial grid . in fig .",
    "[ target ] we show how the global target wave ( top row from left to right ) emerges due to the emergence of resonance between the periodic current and the global oscillations ( bottom row from left to right ) .",
    "the impact of mobility can also be studied in off - lattice simulations , where the radius of the interaction range crucially affects coexistence . in particular , a transition from coexistence to extinction is uncovered with a strikingly non - monotonous behavior in the coexistence probability @xcite .",
    "close to the minimal value of the coexistence probability and under the influence of intermediate mobility , it is even possible to observe transitions between spiral and plane waves over time , as depicted in fig .  2 of @xcite .",
    "in general , strong mobility can either promote or impair coexistence depending on the interaction range , although diversity is quite robust across large regions of the parameter space @xcite .",
    "importantly , these phenomena are absent in any lattice - based model , and it is possible to explain them using partial differential equations similar to eq .",
    "( [ pde ] ) .",
    "off - lattice simulations of rps and related evolutionary games are still relatively unexplored .",
    "partly this is surely due to significantly higher computational resources that are needed to simulate such systems in comparison to traditional spatial games , yet on the other hand , the efforts may be well worth while as the off - lattice setup is closer to some actual conditions than lattice - based simulations .",
    "another interesting phenomenon to consider that is directly related to mobility is epidemic spreading .",
    "the effects of epidemic spreading on species coexistence in a spatial rps game have been studied in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that in the absence of epidemic spreading , there exist extinction basins that are spirally entangled for @xmath70 , while basins of coexistence emerge for @xmath71 . moreover , it has been discovered that intra - species infection promotes coexistence , while inter - species spreading fails to evoke the same effect @xcite .    to close this subsection",
    ", we note that many more interesting and counterintuitive phenomena are observable when more than three strategies compete for space . in a four - strategy system , for example , when a two - strategy neutral alliance may emerge , the intensity of mobility is able to directly select the winning solution of the subsystem @xcite . more specifically , if the mobility is small the rps - type cyclic dynamics is dominant , while if the mobility is large the two - strategy neutral alliances take over . further fascinating examples related to cyclical interactions between more than three strategies are reviewed in section  [ four ] .      in the previous section ,",

    ". however , the topology of the interaction network can play a key role , much the same as by the rps game @xcite . specifically ,",
    "if the interaction network has sufficiently strongly pronounced small - world properties ( there exists a threshold in the fraction of shortcut links that must be exceeded ) , then the stationary three - strategy phase gives way to an oscillatory three - strategy phase @xcite . further strengthening the analogies between the rps game and the public goods game with volunteering",
    ", we note that oscillations in the latter can also be evoked not only through changes in the topology of the interaction network , but also through changes in the payoffs , as illustrated in fig .  1 of @xcite .    interestingly , the so - called joker strategy , introduced by arenas et al .",
    "@xcite , is conceptually different from the loner strategy , but has a similar impact on the evolution of cooperation in social dilemmas .",
    "in particular , in finite well - mixed populations oscillations emerge spontaneously , and this irrespective of the system size and the type of strategy updating @xcite , thus adding yet further support to the relevance of cyclic dominance in evolutionary games .",
    "if the competing strategies in an evolutionary game are more than two ( with some exceptions , as described in subsection  [ time ] ) , this opens up the possibility for the spontaneous emergence of cyclic dominance with much the same properties that characterize the classical rps game .",
    "sometimes , however , three competing strategies are more than three , because some subsystem solutions , typically composed of a subset of the three original strategies , manifest as an additional `` strategy '' .",
    "the fourth `` strategy '' is not exactly equivalent to the original three strategies because it only emerges during the evolutionary process , yet its involvement in the closed loop of dominance is just as important .",
    "these rather exotic solutions , which can be observed only in structured populations , have recently been reported in the spatial public goods game with pool punishment @xcite , and in the spatial ultimatum game with discrete strategies @xcite .    in the spatial public goods game with pool punishment , we initially have three competing strategies , which are cooperators ( @xmath2 ) , defectors ( @xmath144 ) , and pool punishers ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "quite remarkably , at certain parameter values ( see @xcite for details ) , defectors and pool punishers form a stable alliance , which effectively manifests as a strategy , and this strategy forms a closed loop of dominance with cooperators and defectors .",
    "cyclic dominance ensues , where in addition to the two pure strategies @xmath2 and @xmath144 , the @xmath145 alliance is the third competing strategy . as a consequence ,",
    "the characteristic spatial patterns feature propagating fronts made up of all the mentioned competitors , as illustrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ pool ] .",
    "the peculiarity of the above - described solution indicates that it may not be satisfactory to describe the actual state of a three - strategy system by a single `` point '' in a ternary phase diagram .",
    "namely , just the fractions of the competing strategies do not necessarily determine the actual state of the system in an unambiguous way , and this is because spatiality offers an additional degree of freedom in comparison to solutions that can be observed in well - mixed populations .",
    "as described in @xcite , this new degree of freedom may give rise to an additional `` strategy '' that is as such not present at the start of the evolutionary process .",
    "importantly , although such evolutionary solutions may at first glance appear as special and perhaps even limited outcomes of a particular evolutionary game , we emphasize that they may in fact be common place . to corroborate this , we review a completely different evolutionary game , namely the spatial ultimatum game with discrete strategies @xcite . unlike in the public goods game , in the ultimatum game",
    "the focus is not on the aversion of the tragedy of the commons , but rather on the evolution of empathy and fairness @xcite .",
    "while discrete strategies still cover the whole @xmath146 proposal - acceptance parameter plane , the discreetness takes into consideration the fact that in reality these levels are coarse - grained rather than continuous .",
    "thus , instead of the infinite number of continuous strategies , we have @xmath3 discrete strategies @xmath147 , defined according to their @xmath146 interval ( see @xcite for details ) . if @xmath148 , we have @xmath3 different classes of empathetic players who can compete with an additional strategy @xmath0 that is characterized by an arbitrary @xmath146 pair .",
    "most crucially , the finite number of competing strategies enables pattern formation , and as illustrated in the right panel of fig .  [ pool ] , cyclic dominance may emerge spontaneously where a member in the closed loop of dominance can be an alliance of two strategies .",
    "this example , in addition to the previously described one concerning the spatial public goods game with pool punishment @xcite , thus corroborates the fact that in structured populations three competing strategies can in fact be more than three .",
    "extensions of the classical rps game to more than three competing strategies are straightforward ( see fig .  [ web ] ) , and in addition to their obvious appeal from the theoretical point of view @xcite , such games also find actual applicability in describing competition in microbial populations @xcite and larger ecological food webs and communities @xcite .",
    "based on the review of results concerning the rps and related three - strategy evolutionary games with cyclic dominance , it is little surprising that the complexity of spatial patterns , and indeed the complexity of evolutionary solutions in general , increases drastically as we increase the number of strategies that form a closed loop of dominance .",
    "the spontaneous emergence of defensive alliances and numerous stable spatial distributions that are separated by first and second - order phase transitions are just some of the phenomena that one is likely to observe .",
    "the reason behind the mushrooming number of stable solutions with the rising number of competing strategies lies in the fact that the solutions of subsystems , where some strategies are missing , can also be solutions of the whole system .",
    "the final stationary state can thus be determined not only by the competition of individual strategies , but also by the competition of subsystem solutions ( defensive alliances ) that are characterized by their own composition and spatiotemporal distribution of strategies ( we have already reviewed two such examples in fig .  [ pool ] ) .",
    "consequently , the general understanding of evolutionary games with many competing strategies requires the systematic analysis and comparison of all possible subsystem solutions , i.e. , solutions , that are formed by just a subset of all available strategies .",
    "the simplest generalization of the rps game is towards a four - strategy cyclic dominance game @xcite .",
    "as reported in @xcite , the formation of spiral patterns takes place only without a conservation law for the total density , and like in the three - strategy case , strong mobility can destroy species coexistence .",
    "cyclic dominance among four strategies also gives rise to so - called `` neutral '' strategies , who do not invade each other  an option that is not available among three competing strategies . in the absence of mixing , neutral strategies",
    "can easily result in population - wide frozen states , where only those strategies are present who do not invade each other .",
    "more precisely , the coexistence of all four strategies is limited only to a rather narrow range of invasion rates , whereas otherwise the system evolves into a frozen state where only neutral strategies are present @xcite .",
    "this observation further supports the fact that the topology of the food web alone can not unambiguously determine the evolutionary outcome of cyclical interactions .",
    "in addition , the invasion rates and the interaction range are likewise crucial parameters that determine the transitions from coexistence to uniformity among cyclically competing strategies @xcite .",
    "globally synchronized oscillations in a four - strategy cyclic dominance game are also possible , as reported in @xcite and presented in fig .",
    "[ global ] .",
    "in fact , rulquin and arenzon @xcite have shown that such coexistence phases require less long - range interactions than three - strategy phases , although intuitively one would expect the opposite .",
    "since the emergence of long distance , global synchronization states is thus possible even when the food web has multiple subloops and several possible local cycles , this leads to the conjecture that global oscillations might be a general characteristic , even for large , realistic food webs .",
    "in addition to the coexistence of all competing strategies , the emergence of `` frozen '' states , and global oscillations mentioned above , curvature driven domain growth is also possible when the evolutionary dynamics is governed by interactions of equal strength among more than three strategies @xcite . in this case",
    ", the time dependence of the areas of different domains , which can be quantified effectively by means of the length of domain walls , conforms to the well - known algebraic law of the domain growth process @xcite .",
    "the subject that deserves particular attention within the realm of cyclic dominance between more than three strategies is the formation of alliances .",
    "as described in the introductory paragraphs of this section , alliances play a key role in the fascinating complexity and multitude of solutions that grace such systems , particularly through the formation of subsystems solutions that together with the pure strategies form the complete solutions of the whole system .",
    "alliances can emerge in strikingly different ways , although the most common one is the formation of so - called defensive alliances .",
    "for example , in a four - strategy predator - prey system , two neutral strategies can defend each other from the two external invaders @xcite , hence the name a `` defensive alliance '' .",
    "the protective role of an alliance can also be observed when three cyclically dominating strategies are present . in this case",
    ", they can protect each other from an external invader by invading the predator of their prey @xcite .",
    "we also emphasize that cyclically dominant strategies may not necessarily form defensive alliances , even if the governing food web is complex and large .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ web](d ) the strategies @xmath149 form a subsystem solution , but this is not an alliance as it is vulnerable against the invasion of an external strategy . on the other hand , the strategies @xmath150 form an actual alliance , and a membership in the latter can effectively protect all three strategies within the loop from an external invasion .    moreover , if the number of competing strategies is high enough , it is also possible to observe the competition between the different alliances @xcite .",
    "alliance - specific invasion rates , however , can break the symmetry of the food web , and subsequently only a single alliance survives @xcite .",
    "the complexity of a six - species predator - prey food web with alliance - specific invasions rates also enables noise - guided evolution within cyclical interactions @xcite , which is deeply rooted in short - range spatial correlations and is conceptually related to the coherence resonance phenomenon in dynamical systems via the mechanism of threshold duality @xcite .",
    "when it comes to the study of alliances within games of cyclic dominance , the general question to answer is which strategies are capable to form alliances ? as we have reviewed above , two strategies are sufficient to form an alliance , but of course three or even more strategies could also form one . the phase diagram presented in fig .",
    "[ 2_or_3 ] demonstrates that in fact all the mentioned alliances can be present in the stable solution of the system , depending also on the parameter values that determine invasion and mixing in the studied six - species predator - prey system @xcite .",
    "the key property that determines wether an alliance is viable or not is its ability to invade other alliances or resist such an invasion itself . like by the competition among pure strategies , here too the appropriate approach is to measure directly the velocity of invasion between competing domains that contain specific subsystem solutions @xcite . the use of special initial conditions , like the one illustrated in fig .",
    "[ dco ] ( remnants of the straight vertical interface that separated two three - strategy cyclic alliances can still be clearly inferred ) , is thereby very useful and recommended .",
    "unlike by pure strategies , however , here we first need to partition the population and wait for the appropriate subsystem solutions to emerge before removing the barriers along the interfaces .",
    "importantly , the formation of alliances is not always the consequence of specific relations within the governing food web .",
    "alliances may also emerge spontaneously during the evolutionary process , for example due to payoff relations between the competing strategies that are due to multi - point ( group ) interactions .",
    "the phenomenon was observed in the spatial public goods game , where in addition to cooperators and defectors both pool ( @xmath151 ) and peer ( @xmath152 ) punishers competed for space @xcite .",
    "figure  [ dco ] illustrates an example of the spontaneous emergence of two three - strategy cyclic alliances .",
    "notably , either the @xmath153 or the @xmath154 alliance can be stable solutions of the whole system at specific values of the punishment cost and fine .",
    "but if they meet , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ dco ] , the @xmath154 alliance will invade the @xmath153 alliance . remarkably , the invasion process between the two alliances is effectively the same as it would be between two pure strategies .",
    "as by the competition among pure strategies @xcite , by the competition of alliances too the role of mobility ( or diffusion ) is likewise important . within the framework of a nine - species predator - prey model @xcite , it has been shown that below a critical mobility rate , the system exhibits expanding domains of three different defensive alliances , each consisting of three cyclically dominant species .",
    "due to the neutral relationship between these three defensive alliances , a voter - model type coarsening starts @xcite , and after a sufficiently long time only one alliance survives if the system has finite size . above the critical mobility rate ,",
    "however , the three defensive alliances can all coexist @xcite . in a way , the effect of high mobility is thus the opposite to the one observed in the rps game .",
    "there high mobility rates jeopardize diversity and lead to the survival of a single strategy @xcite , while the coexistence of defensive alliances may receive unexpected support .",
    "further related to the impact of mobility on the survival of alliances , a recent study has demonstrated that mobility - dependent selection can prefer either a three - strategy cyclic alliance or a neutral pair of two - strategy alliances within a four - strategy system @xcite .    at this point",
    ", we again emphasize that it is not enough to simply separate random mixtures of selected strategies that are involved in particular alliances and monitor the evolution . before the barriers along the interfaces",
    "are removed , a sufficiently long relaxation time has to be taken into account , which allows the actual subsystem solutions ( rather than just the random mixtures of the involved strategies ) to emerge . only then will the actual competition between the alliances unfold and give correct insights into the power relations between them . in the absence of such a procedure",
    ", it may easily happen that one of the considered subsystem solution can not evolve fast enough , for example due to requiring a longer relaxation time than another subsystem solution , and thus it becomes impossible to properly compare their viability .",
    "a specific example to that effect concerns a five - strategy predator - prey system @xcite , where if the mobility is strong enough the dominance between the competing alliances can vanish simultaneously .",
    "this phenomenon is then also accompanied by a divergence in the density fluctuations of individual strategies . in the absence of mobility , however , the dominance between the alliances does not vanish simultaneously , and only a sharp peak in the density fluctuations can be observed instead of the power - law divergence .",
    "the phenomena observed in the realm of this five - strategy predator - prey system in fact outline a more general type of behavior , namely the mobility - induced reversal of the direction of invasion between the competing alliances , thus highlighting yet again that the topology of the food web does not always ( in fact it does so only rarely ) determine the final evolutionary outcome in structured populations .",
    "as we hope this review clearly shows , cyclical interactions are a fascinating subject which has the power to captivate with the complexity and beauty of the governing evolutionary dynamics , and which in addition to this has many real - life applications that we have only begun to fully appreciate .",
    "we have reviewed main results in well - mixed populations with the focus on oscillatory dynamics and the extinction to absorbing states due to finite system size .",
    "we have also reviewed results on the classical rps game in structured populations .",
    "we have first focused on the important role of the topology of the interaction networks , which may induce oscillatory states , although the latter can be evoked by changes in the game parametrization too .",
    "we have also focused extensively on mobility , which has many practical implications as in real life prey and predators are frequently on the move in order to maximize their chances of survival . we have emphasized that mobility can either promote or jeopardize biodiversity , and it may give rise to fascinatingly rich pattern formation , including spiral and target waves , multi - armed spirals with two , three and four arms , as well as anti - spirals .",
    "mobility can also affect the basins of coexistence and extinction through intra - species and inter - species epidemic spreading .",
    "an alternative metapopulation modeling approach is also reviewed , where the distinction of pair - exchange and hopping processes allows us to discriminate movement in crowded and in diluted regions .",
    "the resulting nonlinear mobility promotes the far field breakup of spiral waves and enhances their convective instability . within this metapopulation formulation ,",
    "we have also derived perturbatively the complex ginzburg - landau equation .",
    "in addition to the review of the well - mixed and spatial rock - paper - scissors game , we have also given special attention to evolutionary games where cyclic dominance emerges spontaneously , for example between only two competing strategies through time - dependent learning , among three strategies in public goods game with volunteering , punishment or reward , as well as by means of the introduction of the joker strategy .",
    "we have reviewed how alliances may effectively act as strategies and close the loop of dominance in three - strategy evolutionary games , including the public goods game with pool punishment and the ultimatum game with discrete strategies .",
    "from there onwards , we have surveyed cyclic dominance when the competing strategies are more than three , where we have emphasized the possibility of competition between alliances .",
    "we have highlighted the importance of the correct preparation of special initial conditions that allow proper monitoring of the invasion relations between the alliances , and we have given prominent exposure to the fact that alliances may also form spontaneously , without support from specific relations within the governing food web .",
    "there are still unexplored problems related to cyclic dominance in evolutionary games that merit further attention .",
    "while physics - inspired studies account for the majority of recent theoretical advances on this topic , there also exist much experimental and theoretical work that was outside the scope of this review .",
    "competitive intransitivity and the coexistence of species in intransitive networks @xcite , as well as community - scale biodiversity in ecological systems with a large number of species @xcite and the governing large competitive networks @xcite , are just some of the topics that we did not cover in detail . while we have mentioned several experiments and empirical data that corroborate the importance of cyclical interaction in the introduction , covering this in detail could easily amount to an independent review .",
    "in addition to the often - cited examples mentioned in the introduction , most recent experimental research suggests that we may have only just begun to scratch the surface of the actual importance of cyclic dominance in nature @xcite",
    ". it would be desirable for the fundamental theoretical advances to become more in sync with the experiments by means of more dedicated and precise mathematical modeling .",
    "it is worth noting that cyclic dominance could be crucial not just to understand biodiversity , but also social diversity @xcite .    in terms of future fundamental research",
    ", we would like to point towards the basically unexplored subject of cyclic dominance in group interactions .",
    "in social dilemmas , the transition from pairwise to group interactions @xcite brings with it many qualitative changes in the evolutionary dynamics ( see @xcite for a review ) , and the reasonable expectation is that the same would hold true in games of cyclic dominance too .",
    "we have recently considered the impact of different interaction ranges in the spatial rps game , and found that the transition from pairwise to group interactions can decelerate and even revert the direction of the invasion between the competing strategies @xcite .",
    "these results thus indicate that , in addition to the invasion rates and other properties of cyclic dominance games already reviewed here , the interaction range is at least as important for the maintenance of biodiversity among cyclically competing strategies , and thus deserves further attention .",
    "motivation for future research can also be gathered from coevolutionary games @xcite , where cyclical interactions can still be considered as being at an early stage of development . while initially many studies that were performed within the realm of social dilemma games appeared to be valid also for games that are governed by cyclical interactions , recent research has made it clear that this is by far not the case .",
    "the incentives are thus there to reexamine the key findings , which were so far reported only for pairwise games on coevolutionary networks , also for games that are governed by cyclical interactions .",
    "we conclude by noting that devising and studying cyclic dominance systems with greater practical applicability and predictive power , including more complex interaction networks and larger numbers of competing strategies , should also be well within the scope of viable forthcoming research .",
