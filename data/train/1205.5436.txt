    "during the last two decades , projectile fragmentation and separation at high energies has become one of the most important methods for the production of exotic nuclei .",
    "production and separation of such species can be performed at energies of around 500 to 1000 @xmath0 mev at the sis / frs facility  @xcite at gsi in darmstadt , germany . at riken in wako ,",
    "japan , the ribf facility with the bigrips separator  @xcite allows to perform such experiments at energies of up to 350 @xmath0 mev .",
    "considerably lower energies of up to 140 @xmath0 mev are attained at the a1900 separator  @xcite at nscl in east lansing , usa , whereas the ganil / lise facility at caen , france , operates below about 80 @xmath0 mev  @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "the main advantage of high - energy projectile fragmentation as a production method lies in the fact that very clean fragment beams can be produced ; the contaminants become less and less important with increasing energy . moreover",
    ", the high energies allow unambiguous event - by - event isotope identification of the fragments produced . again , the higher energies help in suppressing unwanted charge states of the fragments .    all of the above - mentioned facilities rely on good estimates of fragmentation",
    "cross sections in order to predict the production rates of exotic nuclei , together with ion - optical transmission calculations with codes like mocadi  @xcite or lise++  @xcite .",
    "one important tool to predict fragmentation cross sections is a universal analytical formula called epax  @xcite .",
    "this formula allows to calculate the yields from fragmenting all non - fissile projectiles in the range of projectile masses , @xmath1 , between about 40 to 209 .",
    "in particular , the formula tries to take properly into account the influence of the projectile proton or neutron excess onto the neutron - to - proton ratio of the fragments .",
    "the cross sections are assumed to be energy - independent , which seems to be supported by most of the measured data , even though no systematic studies of the bombarding - energy dependence have been performed for targets like @xmath2be .",
    "the epax parametrization aims at reproducing the bulk of the measured cross sections within a factor of two for fragment masses down to about half the projectile mass .",
    "this latter restriction is no severe limitation since the highest transmission in an ion - optical projectile - fragment separator is always attained for small mass and charge differences between projectiles and fragments .",
    "the previous version of the formula , epax 2  @xcite , has proven to give rather realistic estimates of many production cross sections of exotic nuclei . as an example , the very proton - rich fragment @xmath3sn was produced with @xmath4 pb  @xcite in @xmath5xe+@xmath2be ( later remeasured to yield @xmath6 pb by straub _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , not far from the epax 2 prediction of 7.4 pb . on the other hand , large discrepancies with measured data were found for extremely neutron - rich nuclei like , e.g. , fragment yields from 1 @xmath0 gev @xmath7xe+@xmath2be , which were overestimated by epax by up to two orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore desirable to try and modify the epax 2 parameters in such a way that also the yields of very neutron - rich fragments of medium- and heavy - mass projectiles can be predicted with better accuracy .    in the following",
    ", the basic characteristics of the epax formula will be reviewed .",
    "this is followed by an explanation how the parameters of epax can be obtained by fits to recent data sets .",
    "these fits allow to get a feeling how the epax parameters vary with fragment mass and with proton or neutron excess of the projectile .",
    "the final choice of the parameters for epax 3 is then presented , together with comparisons between measured data of selected systems and the predictions of the new parametrization .",
    "as explained in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , the cross section @xmath8 of a fragment with mass @xmath0 and charge @xmath9 produced by projectile fragmentation from a projectile @xmath10 impinging on a target @xmath11 is written as @xmath12    the first term , @xmath13 , represents the mass yield , i.e. the sum of all isobaric cross sections with fragment mass @xmath0 .",
    "the second term , @xmath14 , describes the `` charge dispersion '' , the distribution of elemental cross sections with a given mass , @xmath0 , around its maximum , @xmath15 .",
    "the shape of the charge dispersion is controlled by the width parameter , @xmath16 , and the exponent , @xmath17 .",
    "the factor @xmath18 simply serves to normalize the integral of the charge dispersion approximately to unity .",
    "note that the isobar distributions are not symmetric on the neutron- and proton - rich side , therefore @xmath17 has two different values , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , on the proton- and neutron - rich side of the valley of @xmath21-stability , respectively . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the exponent @xmath17 for the neutron - rich side of the isobar distribution was chosen as @xmath22 . in the present version ,",
    "the exponent on the proton - rich side is also taken as a constant , @xmath23 , close to the value of 2.0 for a gaussian .",
    "thus , in a fitting procedure of the epax parameters to measured data , three parameters have to be obtained for each fragment mass , @xmath0 : an amplitude constant , proportional to the mass yield , @xmath13 , the centroid of the charge dispersion , @xmath15 , and the width parameter , @xmath16 . as was shown in ref .",

    "the same is true for the @xmath124 data points in fig .",
    "[ fig08 ] .",
    "the model tends to slightly underpredict , however , the lowest-@xmath9 data points , where epax 3 seems to follow the data a bit better .",
    "sn+@xmath2be , in comparison with data on a @xmath2be ( ref .",
    "@xcite , squares ) and a @xmath30sn ( ref .",
    "@xcite , circles ) target measured at 1 @xmath0 gev .",
    "the latter data points have been scaled by a factor of 0.65 . ]",
    "contrary to the neutron - rich fragments discussed in the previous subsection , cross sections for even extremely proton - rich fragments like @xmath48ni or @xmath3sn were already predicted with surprising accuracy by epax 2 .",
    "care was undertaken in the present study not to deteriorate the excellent predictive power of epax on the proton - rich side .",
    "[ fig09 ] shows that this has been achieved to a large extent .",
    "the figure shows measured cross sections for @xmath30sn+@xmath2be  @xcite , complemented by data for less exotic fragments from the system @xmath30sn+@xmath30sn  @xcite , both data sets obtained at 1 @xmath0 gev .",
    "the sn - target data were scaled by a factor of 0.65 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) ) to match the be - target data .",
    "[ fig09 ] confirms that both data sets fit together smoothly and that epax 3 describes the entire distributions rather well , very similar to epax 2 . as a benchmark test",
    ", one can check the cross section of @xmath3sn from @xmath30sn+@xmath2be fragmentation : the agreement with the measured value of @xmath125 pb  @xcite has deteriorated a bit , but not much ( version 3 predicts 7.9 pb , compared to 6.6 pb for version 2 ) .",
    "another benchmark is provided by the fragment @xmath48ni produced from @xmath35ni+@xmath35ni at 160 @xmath0 mev with a cross section of @xmath126 fb  @xcite .",
    "this is to be compared with an epax 3 prediction of 20 fb , epax 2 predicted 57 fb .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the epax parametrization contains no bombarding - energy dependent terms , following the concept of `` limiting fragmentation '' , which assumes that the cross sections for the formation of fragments rather close to the projectile are independent of bombarding energy if the latter is sufficiently above the fermi energy in nuclei ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "this concept is difficult to prove since only few systems have been investigated where identical fragments were produced at several different bombarding energies .",
    "one system is @xmath35ni+@xmath2be which was studied at 140 and 650 @xmath0 mev  @xcite .",
    "an example how well results from these two studies fit to each other was shown above in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ; other mass chains exhibit similar agreement .",
    "another study also points to the fact that around 140 @xmath0 mev energy independence is largely achieved : the reaction @xmath28ge+@xmath2be at 132 @xmath0 mev studied by tarasov _",
    "et al . _",
    "most of their cross sections of very neutron - rich fragments in the range @xmath128 are quantitatively reproduced by epax 3 .",
    "on the other hand , a comparison of two @xmath115kr - induced data sets , one measured at 500 @xmath0 mev  @xcite and the other at 64 @xmath0 mev  @xcite , do not yield identical results .",
    "epax fits to the latter yield systematically narrower width parameters , @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , the simple geometrical scaling law for two different targets , which seems to work at high energies ( see figs .  [ fig06],[fig09 ] ) , breaks down as visualized in fig .",
    "11 of ref .",
    "@xcite . in agreement with mocko _",
    "_ we conclude that an energy of 64 @xmath0 mev is below the range of validity of the epax formula .",
    "some modifications of the epax 2 parameters were shown to improve the predictive power of the epax formula in regions where too large cross sections were calculated , in particular for very neutron - rich fragments from medium - mass and heavy projectiles .",
    "in addition to a modified parameter set , a `` downscale factor '' had to be introduced for neutron - rich projectiles that depends on the neutron - excess of the projectile and scales with the neutron - excess of the fragment .",
    "the resulting epax 3 formula reproduces with rather good accuracy the bulk of the measured fragmentation cross sections as long as the incident projectile energy is larger than 130 - 140 @xmath0 mev .",
    "systematic discrepancies were found for @xmath115kr projectiles at 64 @xmath0 mev .",
    "the improvement of epax 3 compared to the previous version is confirmed by the much better agreement with the physical `` cold - fragmentation '' model cofra , which was found to reproduce well measured cross sections for the most neutron - rich fragments from @xmath7xe and @xmath31pb .",
    "the program code of the epax formula can be downloaded from the gsi document server  @xcite .",
