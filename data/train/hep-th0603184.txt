    "in the present work we shall consider the formation of thick branes in a particular generalization of kaluza  klein theory in which the riemannian structure of space time is enlarged into a weylian affine manifold where vector lengths may be not preserved along parallel transportation . more precisely , a weyl geometry is an affine manifold specified by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the metric tensor and @xmath6 is  gauge \" vector involved in the definitions of the affine connections of the manifold .",
    "the particular type of gauge geometries in which the gauge vector is the gradient of a scalar function is called conformally riemann or weyl integrable space time , since a conformal transformation maps a riemann geometry into a weyl integrable one .",
    "if laws of physics were invariant under conformal transformations , the weyl scalar function would be unobservable .",
    "however , since this is not the case , this scalar field can not be discarded in principle by a convenient gauge choice ; moreover , it is enough to dynamically break the conformal invariance of a given weyl integrable theory to transform the weyl scalar function into an observable field .",
    "thus , in this scheme , a fundamental role in the generation of thick brane configurations is ascribed to the scalar weyl field , which is not a bulk field .    on the other hand",
    ", the fact that we could live in a higher dimensional space time with extended extra dimensions turns out to be completely compatible whit present time gravitational experiments .",
    "an interesting picture arises in such scenarios : from the point of view of an observer located at a 3brane in which matter is confined , gravity is essentially 4dimensional , however , the world can be higher dimensional with infinite extra dimensions and gravity can propagate in all of them .",
    "multidimensional space times with large extra dimensions turned out to be very useful when addressing several problems of high energy physics like the cosmological constant , dark matter and the mass hierarchy problem @xcite@xcite as well as the recent non  supersymmetric string model realization of the standard model at low energy with no extra massless matter fields @xcite .",
    "the striking success of these higher dimensional scenarios motivated several generalizations in various directions including thick brane configurations @xcite@xcite .",
    "these configurations were generalized in the framework of weyl geometries for @xmath0symmetric manifolds in @xcite .",
    "moreover , localization of 4d gravity on thick branes that break reflection symmetry was presented in @xcite for a constant self  interacting potential of the scalar field @xmath7 .    in this paper",
    "we keep working in a manifold endowed with weyl structure and present the realization of such a scenario on thick brane solutions made out of scalar matter with a self  interacting potential endowed with an arbitrary parameter @xmath8 : @xmath9 , enlarging the class of potentials for which 4d gravity can be localized .",
    "thus , we begin by considering a 5dimensional weyl gravity model in which geometrical thick branes arise naturally without the necessity of introducing them by hand in the action of the theory . in order to obtain solutions which describe such configurations and respect 4d poincar invariance",
    "we implement a conformal transformation to pass from the weyl frame to the riemann one , where the weylian affine connections become christoffel symbols and the field equations are simpler , solve these equations and return to the weyl frame to analyze the physics of the solution . in what follows",
    "we shall refer to this method as the conformal technique .",
    "thus , in this way we obtain a solution that represents a localized function which does not necessarily respect reflection @xmath0symmetry and allows for both compact and non  compact manifolds in the extra dimension . by looking at the energy density of the scalar field of these solutions",
    "we interpret the field configuration as thick branes .",
    "the structure of these brane configurations depends on the topology of the extra dimension and the value of the parameter @xmath10 .",
    "we investigate as well the fluctuations of the metric around the classical background solution to understand whether 4d gravity can be described in our setup .",
    "we show that this is the case since the analog quantum mechanical problem with a volcano potential for the transverse traceless sector of the fluctuations of the metric yields a continuum and gapless spectrum of kk states with a stable zero mode that corresponds to the 4d graviton .",
    "we finally make our conclusions .",
    "let us start by considering a pure geometrical weyl action in five dimensions .",
    "this non  riemannian generalization of the kaluza ",
    "klein theory is given by @xmath11,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is a weyl manifold specified by the pair @xmath13 , @xmath5 being the metric and @xmath14 a weyl scalar function .",
    "the weylian ricci tensor reads @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the affine connections on @xmath12 , @xmath17 are the christoffel symbols and @xmath18 ; the constant @xmath19 is an arbitrary coupling parameter , and @xmath20 is a self  interaction potential for the scalar field @xmath14 .",
    "this action is of pure geometrical nature since the scalar field that couples to gravity is precisely the scalar function @xmath14 that enters in the definition of the affine connections of the weyl manifold and , thus , can not be discarded in principle from our consideration .",
    "apart from the self  interaction potential , the action ( [ action ] ) is invariant under weyl rescalings @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a smooth function on @xmath12 .",
    "thus , from these relations it follows that the potential must undergo the transformation @xmath23 in order to keep such an invariance .",
    "thus , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a constant parameter , is the form of the potential which preserves the scale invariance of the weyl manifold ( [ action ] ) . when this invariance is broken , the weyl",
    "scalar field transforms from a geometrical object into a physically observable matter degree of freedom which , in turn , generates the thick brane configurations .",
    "since we are looking for a solution to the theory ( [ action ] ) with 4-dimensional poincar invariance we shall consider the line element in the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the warp factor depending on the extra coordinate @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "thus , the 5dimensional stress ",
    "energy tensor is given by its 4dimensional and pure 5dimensional components @xmath30\\eta_{mn } , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "t_{55}=\\frac{6(a')^2}{8\\pi g_5},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the comma denotes derivatives with respect to the fifth coordinate @xmath28 .",
    "since we shall use the conformal technique to find solutions to our system , we perform the conformal transformation @xmath31 , mapping the weylian action ( [ action ] ) into the riemannian one @xmath32,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 , @xmath34 and all hatted magnitudes and operators are defined in the riemann frame . in this frame",
    "we have a theory which describes 5dimensional gravity minimally coupled to a scalar field which possesses a self  interaction potential . after this transformation",
    ", the line element ( [ line ] ) yields the riemannian metric @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "further , by following @xcite we introduce the new variables @xmath37 and @xmath38 and get the following pair of coupled field equations from the action ( [ confaction ] ) @xmath39 in general , it is not trivial to fully integrate these field equations . under some assumptions ,",
    "it is straightforward to construct several particular solutions to them .",
    "however , quite often such solutions lead to expressions of the dynamical variables that are too complicated for an analytical treatment in closed form .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , this system of equations can be easily solved if one uses the condition @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is an arbitrary constant parameter which is not allowed to adopt the value @xmath42 because the system would be incompatible .",
    "it turns out that this restriction leads to a riemannian potential of the form @xmath43 .",
    "thus , under these conditions , both field equations in ( [ fielde ] ) reduce to a single differential equation @xmath44 those authors noticed as well that by choosing the parameter @xmath45 ( while leaving the parameter @xmath41 arbitrary ) the exponential function of the right hand side of ( [ finale ] ) disappears and the equation can be easily solved .",
    "this case corresponds to having a constant self ",
    "interaction potential of the form @xmath46 in the weyl frame which , breaks the invariance under weyl rescalings .",
    "it is interesting to note that after solving equation ( [ finale ] ) with such a simplification , the obtained solution @xmath47\\ ] ] does not allow the value @xmath48 ( apart from @xmath42 ) since the constants involved in it read @xmath49    in this paper we shall consider another truncation that leads to a further simplification and to a simple solution of the equation ( [ finale ] ) .",
    "this can be done by setting @xmath48 , while leaving @xmath8 arbitrary , allowing to have a self  interaction potential @xmath50 in the weyl frame . in this sense",
    "our solution supplements the solution obtained in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this potential breaks the invariance under weyl scaling transformations for arbitrary @xmath51 and also transforms the geometrical scalar field @xmath14 into an observable one leads to a constant self  interacting potential @xmath46 in the original weyl frame , a case which was considered by @xcite and @xcite . ] .",
    "thus , after imposing the condition @xmath48 , the second term in the left hand side of the equation ( [ finale ] ) vanishes , yielding @xmath52 where @xmath53 .    by solving the latter equation for @xmath14 and integrating the relation @xmath54 one gets the following solution @xmath55 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "e^{2a}=\\left[\\frac{\\sqrt{-8\\lambda p}}{c_1}\\cosh\\left(c_1(y - c_2)\\right)\\right]^{\\frac{3}{2p}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are arbitrary integration constants , and we have set to one a constant that multiplies the warp factor .    by looking at the solution , we see that for @xmath58 it constitutes a localized object which does not necessarily preserve the reflection @xmath0symmetry ( @xmath59 ) along the fifth dimension and breaks it through non  trivial values of the shift parameter @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the 5dimensional space time is not restricted to be an orbifold geometry , allowing for a more general type of manifolds .",
    "the extra coordinate can be compact or extended depending on the signs of the constants @xmath60 and @xmath25 , and the real or imaginary character of the parameter @xmath56 which , indeed , characterizes the width of the warp factor @xmath61 .",

    "the structure of the thick branes depends on the value of the parameter @xmath10 .",

    "actually , these branes live in different disconnected regions of the weyl manifold due to the fact that the 5d curvature scalar is singular at the points @xmath81 : @xmath86,\\ ] ] where plausibly we have null scalar energy densities .",

    "it was proved useful to recast equation ( [ eqttm ] ) into schrdinger s equation form . in order to accomplish this , we adopt the following ansatz for the transverse traceless modes of the fluctuations @xmath103 and get @xmath104\\psi=0,\\ ] ] where we have dropped the subscripts in @xmath105 , @xmath106 is the mass of the kk excitation , and the potential reads @xmath107    for the particular non  compact case a ) we have found two particular cases ( @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) for which we can invert the coordinate transformation @xmath98 and explicitly express @xmath28 in terms of @xmath110 ; although the first case is more involved , it is qualitatively equivalent to the second one in the sense that their potential presents a similar behaviour . for the sake of simplicity",

    "this function represents the lowest energy eigenfunction of the schrdinger equation ( [ schrodinger ] ) since it has no zeros .",
    "this fact allows for the existence of a 4d graviton with no instabilities from transverse traceless modes with @xmath118 .",

    "this mathematical fact implies that we actually have two disconnected regions in the weyl manifold : the region @xmath121 is separated from the region @xmath122 ( since we can shift the domain of the compact dimension to @xmath123 ) by the physical singularities located at @xmath81 ( recall that the curvature scalar is singular at these points ) .",

    "our field configurations correspond to thick brane generalizations of the rs model which do not restrict the 5dimensional space time to be an orbifold geometry , a fact that can be useful in approaching several issues like the cosmological constant problem , black hole physics and holographic ideas , where there is a relationship between the position in the extra dimension and the mass scale @xcite .",

    "a remarkable fact is that in this case , the scalar curvature of the weyl integrable manifold turns out to be completely regular in the extra dimension . in the compact case",
    "b ) the situation is different : we have several pairs of thick brane configurations disconnected by physical singularities .",
    "the structure of these branes depends on the value of the parameter @xmath10 . in a special case ( @xmath80 ) we managed to perform a coordinate transformation which makes the metric conformally flat ,",
    "decompactifies the fifth dimension and simultaneously pushes the singularities of the manifold to infinity !",
    "we wrote the wave equations of the transverse traceless modes of the linear fluctuations of the metric into the schrdinger s equation form for both cases a ) and b ) .",
    "the analog quantum mechanical potential involved in it represents a volcano potential with finite bottom : a negative well located between two finite positive barriers that vanish when @xmath132 .",
    "it turned out that for the massless zero modes ( @xmath2 ) the schrdinger equation can be solved in both cases . as a result of this fact , in each case we obtained an analytic expression for the lowest energy eigenfunction of the schrdinger equation which represents a single bound state and allows for the existence of a stable 4d graviton since there are no tachyonic modes with @xmath118 .",
    "apart from these massless states , we also got a continuum and gapless spectrum of massive kk modes with positive @xmath3 that are suppressed at @xmath1 and turn asymptotically into continuum plane waves in both cases a ) and b ) , as in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
