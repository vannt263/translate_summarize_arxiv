    "a measure of volume for regions in the quantum state space is needed in a range of situations , from comparing the relative importance of different regions , to quantifying the typicality of certain quantum properties .",
    "any volume measure can be thought of as a probability distribution on the state space , with the volume of the full space normalized to unity .",
    "the choice of an appropriate measure or distribution depends on the operational situation at hand , and a variety have been used in the literature , e.g. , the hilbert ",
    "schmidt measure , the bures measure , the haar measure on the eigenbasis choice complemented by a chosen distribution on the eigenvalues , etc .",
    "( see , for example , chapter 14 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "many of these distributions are easy to state conceptually , but are difficult to sample from , i.e. , to produce a set of quantum states distributed in accordance with the chosen measure .",
    "such samples are needed for any numerical calculation over the measure , e.g. , computing the average value of a quantity over a given region . here",
    ", we make use of hamiltonian monte carlo ( hmc ) methods , adapted to the quantum situation as described in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as our work in ref .",
    "@xcite was motivated by quantum tomographic problems using a bayesian approach , we provide ready - made samples for natural prior distributions for common tomography scenarios .",
    "the same hmc code can be adapted by users to generate samples relevant for their own purposes beyond tomography .",
    "the _ state _ @xmath0 of a quantum system , also known as the statistical operator or the density matrix , is a nonnegative operator with unit trace , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath1 in a finite @xmath2-dimensional hilbert space , @xmath0 can be written as a @xmath3 matrix , fully determined by @xmath4 independent real parameters .    a _ measurement _ is described by a set of outcomes @xmath5 , where the @xmath6s are nonnegative operators , @xmath7 , with unit sum , @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is referred to as a positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) , or a probability - operator measurement ( pom ) .",
    "each @xmath6 corresponds to a detector in the measurement apparatus .",
    "the probability that the @xmath10th detector clicks , given an input state @xmath0 to the measurement apparatus , is @xmath11 according to the born rule .",
    "the nonnegative and unit - sum properties of the @xmath6s assure that each @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we write @xmath14 to denote the set of probabilities corresponding to the set of outcomes @xmath9 .",
    "the povm @xmath9 can be thought of as a map from the state space of @xmath0s to the probability space of @xmath15s , @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath9 is generally a many - to - one map .",
    "a povm @xmath9 that is one - to - one , i.e. , the probabilities @xmath15 identify a unique quantum state @xmath0 , is said to be _ informationally complete _ ( ic ) ; it is not informationally complete ( nic ) otherwise .    in quantum tomography ,",
    "it is more natural to work in the probability space , rather than in the state space : the tomographic data gathered for a chosen measurement @xmath9 tell us about the probabilities @xmath15 , not the state @xmath0 ; they are equivalent only for ic povms .",
    "hence , the discussion below will be in the probability space .",
    "one can easily generalize to a different context where the state space is the natural arena : choose a convenient ic povm to establish a one - to - one mapping from the state space of interest to the probability space .",
    "we write the volume element of the infinitesimal vicinity of @xmath15 in the probability space as @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the target distribution of our choice , and @xmath19 denotes@xmath20 @xmath21 expresses the constraints imposed on the probability space by quantum mechanics : the nonnegative and unit - trace properties of @xmath0 translate  through @xmath9into constraints on @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath21 is hence the indicator function for the subregion of the probability space relevant for quantum mechanics for a given @xmath9 .",
    "a @xmath15 is called _ physical _ or _",
    "permissible _ if it satisfies all the constraints . for low - dimensional systems",
    ", @xmath21 can be written down explicitly ; this becomes more difficult for high - dimensional systems , and is anyway not necessary for computational purposes ( see appendix a of ref .",
    "here , we explain the various target distributions and povms used to create the samples found on the website . a list of samples available for download can be found in table [ tbl : filename ] .",
    "the ready - made samples are generated in accordance with the following choices for the target distribution @xmath18 :    @xmath22    here , the @xmath18s are unnormalized  the normalization is inconsequential for the hmc algorithm as well as the samples generated .",
    "the terminology of a _ prior _ is natural for our original intended bayesian approach where a distribution @xmath18 is chosen to encapsulate our knowledge about the probability space prior to data - taking ; a user interested in other contexts should simply read `` prior '' as `` target distribution '' .",
    "the three specific priors are oft - encountered choices in quantum tomography .",
    "the primitive prior suggests that the distribution is uniform in @xmath15 over the physical probability space .",
    "the jeffreys prior @xcite is a common choice of prior when no external prior information is available . the conjugate prior is a convenient way of incorporating prior knowledge that a particular @xmath15 ( e.g. , a particular @xmath15 is the target preparation ) or region of the probability space is more likely than others . here , we employ specifically the conjugate prior with the hyperparameters set to @xmath23 .",
    "the povms used to generate the samples are common ones employed in tomography experiments . for contexts beyond tomography , the ic povms can be the chosen mapping between @xmath0 and @xmath15 .",
    "below , @xmath24 refers to the heaviside unit step function and @xmath25 is the dirac delta function .",
    "we consider two povms : the four - outcome tetrahedron povm of minimal qubit tomography @xcite , and the six - outcome pauli povm that measures the three mutually unbiased bases of the pauli matrices @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . the tetrahedron povm is a symmetric informationlly complete ( sic ) povm for dimension 2 . in the following , we have @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 for the expectation values of the pauli matrices .",
    "tetrahedron povm : :    ( @xmath33 ) @xmath34    the constraint factor @xmath21 is    @xmath35 pauli povm : :    ( @xmath36 ) @xmath37 in this    case , the constraint factor is @xmath38}\\,\\eta\\biggl(\\frac{1}{9}-\\sum_{l=1}^{3}(p_{l}-p_{l+3})^{2}\\biggr).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      here , we consider two nic povms that provide no information about @xmath39 .",

    "we choose one of them , written in vector form ( the columns ) , such that , @xmath46\\!,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the cubic root of unity , with @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we consider the scenario where each of the two qubits is measured by the four - outcome tetrahedron povm of eq .   respectively .",
    "the resulting two - qubit povm ( which is ic ) has sixteen outcomes with the single @xmath51-function constraint of unit sum , so the probability space is 15-dimensional .      in the bb84 scenario of quantum key distribution , the two parties use two four - outcome crosshair measurements of eq .   and",
    "so have sixteen outcomes for the composed povm",
    ". however , there are eight @xmath51-function constraints for the probabilities , resulting in the probability space being 8-dimensional .    on the other hand , one qubit can be measured by using the three - outcome trine measurement of eq .  , and another by the anti - trine measurement with the signs of @xmath52 and @xmath53 changed in eq .  , namely , the tat scheme",
    "the resulting povm has nine outcomes with the single @xmath51-function constraint of unit sum , so the probability space is again 8-dimensional .      for higher dimensions , such as @xmath54 and @xmath55 ,",
    "the samples are generated using the following procedure ( see footnote 11 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) : first generate a square random matrix @xmath56 with all entries being independent complex gaussian numbers , then the quantum state is constructed by @xmath57 .",
    "this gives the primitive prior for any ic povm .",
    "the method can be used in place of the hmc code ( see next section ) to generate samples according to the primitive prior for any dimension .",
    "the available samples are listed in table  [ tbl : filename ] .",
    "there are two different formats for the sample files , namely , _",
    ".mat _ and _ .txt_. the _ .mat _",
    "files are workspace files that can be directly loaded into _ matlab _",
    ", with the variables explained in table  [ tbl : check ] .",
    "the _ .txt _ files store the real and imaginary parts ( as two separate files ) of the generated quantum states . each row in the _ .txt",
    "_ files corresponds to one state , which can be easily formatted to a @xmath3 matrix row after row .",
    "different sets of povms define the same probability space if they are linearly related , so that the jacobian for the transformation between the corresponding probabilities is a numerical value .",
    "therefore , if the target distribution is the primitive prior ( i.e. , uniform over the physical probability space ) , it does not matter which povm we choose for the sampling .",
    "we denote such cases by `` @xmath58 '' in table  [ tbl : filename ] .",
    "the two - qubit quantum states generated with nic povms carry different weights ( corresponding files with suffix `` _ _ _ range _ _ '' ) , because of the nic nature of the povms used . for more details",
    ", please see ref .",
