    "mass of galactic spheroid component ( galactic bulge or elliptical galaxy itself ) is tightly correlated with mass of central black hole ( bh ) both in normal and active galaxies ( gebhardt et al .",

    "along with the lack of its cosmic evolution ( shields et al .  2003 ; kiuchi 2006 ; see however , akiyama 2005 , woo et al .",
    "2006 , and borys 2005 ) , the tightness of the correlation indicates that the growth of spheroid mass and that of bh mass ( @xmath10 ) occur almost contemporarily .    however , no direct evidence for simultaneous coevolution has been found , and thus its physical origin remains a great mystery .",
    "jet and/or outflow from an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) may govern the formation of spheroid ( silk & rees 1998 ) ; i.e. , bhs made before the bulges growth . on the contrary , radiation drag by massive stars during the bulge formation may have controlled the bh growth ( umemura 2001 ) , resulting in bulges formed prior to bhs growth .",
    "most numerical studies presume that cool , interstellar gas drives coevolution ( e.g. , kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ) .",
    "for instance , semi ",
    "analytical approaches assume a major merging of galaxies initiates the growth of bhs and bulges , and usually adopt an agn duration ( @xmath11folding accretion time scale ) around @xmath12yr and a star formation duration of @xmath13yr ( kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ; kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ) . theoretically and observationally , it is unknown which growth phase precede another .",
    "now , let us simply assume that the bh and bulge growth phases begin conjunctionally and proceed with similar durations .",
    "then , we will see enough molecular gas ",
    "fuel for the coming star formation  in the bulges of agns in the early stage of bh growth ( e.g. , in the first quarter of the agn / star formation durations ) .",
    "old agns ( e.g. , in the last quarter of the durations ) that have spent long time since the ignition of coevolution would have already consumed the gas through the past star formation , with only a tiny amount of leftover for further bulge growth .    here",
    ", we notice a subsample of agns , narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy ( nls1 ) , as possibly young agns .",
    "nls1s are characterized ( see pogge 2000 ) by ( i ) narrower balmer lines of hydrogen ( fwhm of @xmath14 @xmath15 2000 km s@xmath16 ) , relative to usual broad - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( bls1s ) and qsos having fwhm of @xmath14 @xmath17 5000 km s@xmath16 ( osterbrock & pogge 1985 ) .",
    "( ii ) they often emit strong optical 2 multiplets ( e.g. , halpern & oke 1987 ) , and show ( iii ) steep and luminous soft x - ray excess ( pounds et al .",

    "1996 ; boller et al . 1997",
    "; leighly 1999a ; hayashida 2000 ) .",
    "characteristics in ( ii)(iv ) indicate that nls1s are non - obscured objects , alike type 2 ( i.e. , obscured ) agns . currently , the most promising picture of nls1s is that they contain relatively less massive black holes ( with @xmath18 ) and higher @xmath19 ratio ( @xmath20 ; e.g. , brandt & boller 1998 ; hayashida 2000 ; mineshige 2000 ) , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the agn luminosity and eddington luminosity , respectively .",
    "nls1s occupy 1030% among type 1 agns in the local universe ( see kawaguchi 2004b ) .    high @xmath19 ratios of nls1s imply that their bhs are now growing rapidly via super - eddington accretion ( rees 1992 ; mathur 2000 ; kawaguchi et al .",
    "2004b ) . provided that a gas accretion rate onto the central bh , @xmath23 , during an agn phase does not drastically change with time ( see collin & kawaguchi 2004 ) , large @xmath24 ratios of nls1s also mean that the elapsed time since the ignition of an agn activity is shorter than that of bls1s .",
    "( if the gas accretion lasts long enough , then @xmath25 would not be so small . )",
    "bulge luminosity of nls1s are smaller than those of bls1s in general ( botte et al . 2004 ) .",
    "nls1s are likely young active galactic nuclei [ during the first 1030% of the whole agn lifetime ( @xmath13yr ; see  6 ) ] , in the process of coevolution of supermassive bhs and bulges .",
    "this is our working hypothesis in this study .",
    "we consider that they are the best and unique targets to explore how the bh - bulge coevolution proceeds .",
    "if the growth phases of bhs and bulges are really overlapped , bulges of nls1s may also be rapidly growing with a significant amount of molecular gas accumulated in their bulges .",
    "do they show large ratios of molecular - gas to bulge masses , compared with bls1s ( which are expected to be older than nls1s , based on their lower @xmath24 ratios ) ? to examine these conjecture , we need copious data for numerous nls1s , collected under the condition that the spatial resolution is less than the bulge size ( typically in the order of 1kpc )",
    ".    however , nls1s are rare among seyfert 1 galaxies , and thus we do not have many nls1s , whose co emission are detected , in the nearby universe .",
    "therefore , observations to increase the number of co - detected nls1s are fundamental for listing strong co emitters , with an eye to follow  up sub ",
    "kpc observations on them .",
    "the @xmath25bulge mass relation of nls1s and its comparison with the relation of inactive galaxies are subjects of debate ( komossa & xu 2007 , and references therein ) .",

    "let us now summarize this section .",
    "mass of new stars that will be formed ( within @xmath94yr from now on ) from the molecular gas is not a huge fraction of the current stellar masses ( 15% ) . here",
    ", we conclude that the bulges of these two nls1s do not evolve so much in this timescale .",
    "if newly born stars are to belong to the galactic disks rather than the bulges , the conclusion ( small growth in the bulge mass ) is enhanced .",
    "this result can be interpreted in some ways .",
    "( 1 ) coevolution is not simultaneous at all : bulges ( and elliptical galaxies ) were formed in the early universe ( akiyama 2005 ; woo 2006 ) , while bh growth via accretion still happens today .",
    "( 2 ) alternatively , coevolution of bhs and bulges can be ( quasi- ) simultaneous with two growth episodes overlapped or close in time .",
    "( 2 - 1 ) our result indicates that the bulge growth have finished prior to the bh growth ( e.g. , umemura 2001 ) .",
    "( 2 - 2 ) or , coevolution may occur intermittently through a number of episodic events .",
    "each coevolving agn could have very short durations of bh and bulge growth , with small increases in @xmath6 and in @xmath25 , resulting in a small fraction of molecular gas associated with the agn even in the early evolutionary stage ( nls1s ) .",
    "the total lifetime of an agn is estimated as @xmath13  yr ( martini 2004 ; jakobsen et al .",
    "2003 ) . while , a lower limit for the duration of an episodic event of an agn is about @xmath107 yr , based on the proximity effect ( e.g. , bajtlik et al . 1988 ) and the sizes of ionization - bounded narrow - line regions ( bennert et al .",
    "therefore , bh  bulge coevolution could be divided into numerous shorter events .",
    "from fir luminosity or from molecular  gas mass , the current star formation rate can be estimated . the regression relation between 40120@xmath30 m fir luminosity ( helou 1985 ) . ] and @xmath2 is typically ( for galaxies similar to the milky way ) expressed as ( see kennicutt 1998 ; tinney 1990 ) , @xmath109 .",

    "( on the other hand , observed fir luminosity by iras , shown below , includes the fir emission from entire galaxy and from agn . )",
    "inferred masses (  4.2 ) indicate that their @xmath111 are @xmath112 @xmath113 and @xmath114 @xmath113 , respectively .    by translating these fir luminosities to the star formation rate ( sfr ) by ( kennicutt 1998 ) @xmath115 their sfrs ( at their central region )",

    "[ eq : firmh2 ] and  [ eq : sfrfir ] , an error of sfr estimated from @xmath2 would be @xmath118dex .    incidentally , observed @xmath111 of the 2 iras galaxies ( measured via iras , including contributions from entire host galaxy and from nuclei ) are 2.7 @xmath54 10@xmath119 ( iras  04312 ) and 6.3 @xmath54 10@xmath119 ( iras  05262 ) .",
    "if these @xmath111 are used instead , their sfrs are evaluated to be 5 and 11 @xmath120 , respectively .",
    "since these values likely overestimate the central @xmath111 and thus central sfrs , we hereafter refer the sfrs estimated in the previous paragraph .",
    "next , we evaluate the accretion rates onto their central bhs @xmath23 , by adopting two simplified methods .",
    "firstly , we estimate @xmath23 based on bolometric luminosities , with an assumption of a constant radiation efficiency .",

    "[ we note that up to @xmath122 of the optical luminosity may originate in the host galaxies ( surace 2001 ; bentz 2006 ) .",

    "the radiation efficiency ( with respect to the rest  mass energy of the infalling gas ) is set to be 0.05 ( e.g. , shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; novikov & thorne 1973 ) .",
    "then , @xmath23 are estimated to be 1.3 and 5.2@xmath124yr , resulting in the sfr/@xmath23 ratios of 2.5 and 1.8 for iras  04312 and iras  05262 , respectively .",
    "when @xmath23 exceeds the eddington limit ( @xmath125 ) , however , the radiation efficiency drops due to the onset of photon trapping ( begelman 1978 ; abramowicz 1988 ) .",
    "thus , estimates using accretion disk models are more adequate than those using a constant efficiency ( see e.g. , kawaguchi 2003 ; collin & kawaguchi 2004 ) . here ,",
    "@xmath23 is then estimated based on optical luminosity and the ( standard ) accretion disk model with a face - on disk geometry assumed ( e.g. , bechtold 1987 ) : @xmath126 @xmath127^{1.5}.   \\label{eq : mdot}\\ ] ] with this equation , we get 19 and 76@xmath128 for iras  04312 and iras  05262 , respectively . here",
    ", we obtain yet smaller sfr/@xmath23 ratios of 0.17 and 0.12 , respectively .",
    "then , let us discuss these ratios in the context of @xmath108 relation .",
    "the ratio of bulge masses to bh masses in galaxies is about 700 ( hring & rix 2004 ) .",
    "this number is considerably larger than the sfr ",
    "to@xmath23 ratios for the two nls1s ( @xmath20 ) estimated above .",
    "what does this huge difference mean then ?",
    "our result ( the sfr  to@xmath23 ratios @xmath8 1 for the two nls1s ) can indicate that @xmath23 in nls1s is temporarily large . to compensate the intense bh growth during the nls1s , a short - term , intense starburst ( with much higher sfr than the current sfr ) happens before or in the future ( i.e. , bulge growth and bh growth phases appear without an overlapped period ) .",
    "if the duration of star formation is much longer than the duration of agn phase instead , such an intense starburst is not required .",
    "heckman ( 1989 ) showed that co and [ o iii ] lines have similar widths . while , [ o iii ] line widths",
    "are now often used as surrogate for bulge stellar dispersion @xmath85 of agns ( nelson & whittle 1996 ; nelson 2000 ; shields 2003 ; boroson 2003 ) .",
    "then , shields ( 2006 ) proposed co width as surrogate for @xmath85 ( see also ho 2007 ) , although they found a systematic difference ( @xmath129 } / \\sigma_{\\rm co } \\approx 0.15$]dex , on average , for the seven pg quasars they looked at ) . by using the co width for high redshift quasars , they examined the evolution of @xmath130 relation at @xmath131 , arguing that high-@xmath132 quasars have smaller @xmath133 ratios than quasars at @xmath134 .    here",
    ", we compare co width and [ o iii ] width using our results , in order to assess the relation between co width and [ o iii ] width for nls1s .",
    "full - width at zero - intensity ( fwzi ) , evaluated with the ranges drawn in figures [ fig : ir043spec][fig : ir052spec ] with `` flux '' labels , for the two nls1s are 384kms@xmath16 ( iras  04312 ) and 388kms@xmath16 ( iras  05262 ) .",
    "following shields ( 2006 ) , we also assume that fwhm(co ) @xmath135fwzi .",
    "then , fwhm(co ) for these two iras galaxies are about 260kms@xmath16 , which is less than their @xmath136)}$ ] widths ( 380kms@xmath16 and 365kms@xmath16 , respectively ) .",
    "this is the same trend that shields ( 2006 ) presented for pg quasars .",
    "therefore , usage of co width to estimate @xmath85 can lead a systematic error upon @xmath4 for nls1s as well .",
    "the difference between the co and [ o iii ] widths are @xmath137dex for the two nls1s , providing a factor of 4 less @xmath4 for co - based mass .",
    "the tight correlation between mass of central bhs and mass of galactic spheroid components ( galactic bulge or elliptical galaxy itself ) in galaxies and agns indicates contemporaneous coevolution of the two massive systems .",
    "however , no direct evidence for simultaneous growth has been found .",
    "we aim to reveal whether bh growth and bulge growth take place ( quasi- ) simultaneously , by determining the amount and distribution of molecular gas ( fuel for the coming star formation ) in young agns .",
    "nls1s are characterized by relatively small bh masses and high eddington ratios .",
    "larger @xmath24 ratios of nls1s than those of bls1s indicate that bhs in nls1s are now growing rapidly , and that nls1s are younger than bls1s .",
    "if the growth phases of bhs and bulges are really overlapped , bulges of nls1s may also be rapidly growing with a significant amount of molecular gas accumulated in their bulges . however , nls1s are only 1030% among seyfert 1 galaxies , and thus we do not have many nls1s , whose co emission is detected , in the nearby universe . in order to investigate the nature of molecular gas in nls1s in general , it is fundamental to increase the number of nearby nls1s with their co emission lines detected .",
    "thus , we performed @xmath0co ( @xmath1 ) observations using the nma d - configuration for two fir - bright nls1s located at @xmath138 with 56 ",
    "( 24 kpc at their distance ) resolution .",
    "we detect their co emission for the first time , with @xmath2 of @xmath3 .",
    "these molecular  gas masses are the 2nd and 4th largest masses among nls1s .    by estimating @xmath75 and @xmath4 with the co channel maps and co line widths , we get @xmath139 and @xmath104 ratios of 0.250.35 and 0.130.33 , respectively . taking account the star formation efficiency ( @xmath5 ) , the increase in @xmath6 in those nls1s in the near future",
    "is expected not to be a huge fraction ( 15% of the mass of the preexisting stars ) .",
    "this result can be interpreted in some ways .",
    "coevolution may not be simultaneous at all : bulges ( and elliptical galaxies ) were formed in the early universe , while bh growth via accretion still happens today . or , the bulge growth may have finished prior to the bh growth . alternatively , coevolution may proceed with many , occasional discrete events , where one coevolution event produces only a small amount of mass growth of bhs and of bulges .",
    "we further discuss the relation between star formation rates and accretion rates , in the context of the @xmath25@xmath4 correlation .",
    "the two nls1s turned out to have much smaller sfr/@xmath23 ratios ( @xmath81 ) than the @xmath9 ratios of normal and active galaxies .",
    "this huge difference can indicate either that bulge growth and bh growth phases appear without an overlapped period , or that the duration of star formation is much larger than the duration of agn phase .    for the two nls1s , co widths are less than their [ o iii ] widths ( by 0.150.17 dex ) , which is the same trend that shields ( 2006 ) presented for several pg quasars .",
