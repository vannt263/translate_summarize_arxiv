    "procuring accurate fundamental measurements of the masses and radii of stars remains one of the most outstanding questions in astronomy .",
    "this is crucial in the high - mass regime , which is essential for determining the slope of the initial mass function ( imf ) for high - mass stars .",
    "the sensitivity of stellar models to the initial mass can not be overstated .",
    "this , then , necessitates fundamental determinations of stellar masses with errors @xmath513@xmath6 @xcite in order to reject models with incorrect underlying physics .",
    "as emphasized in the review by @xcite , there are only 95 detached binary systems of any mass in which the mass and radius of both components are known to @xmath7 or better .",
    "all but one are eclipsing binaries , with the sole exception being the sun s nearest neighbor , @xmath8 centauri .",
    "of the 95 total systems there are only eight with @xmath9 , three with @xmath10 , and none with @xmath11 .",
    "even when applying a less stringent uncertainty cutoff , only 14 stars with @xmath11 have both their mass and radius known to @xmath12 or better @xcite .",
    "this paucity of accurately determined stellar masses and radii at the high - mass end requires an expedient redressing .",
    "fundamental measurements of properties for a statistical sample of massive stars will allow us to constrain theoretical models , anchor the imf at the high - mass end , and better comprehend stellar structure and evolution .    the cygnus ob2 association presents the ideal laboratory within which to learn about the fundamental properties of massive stars .",
    "it is the nearest massive star - forming region , making it a prime target observationally , even in spite of the extinction in the larger cygnus region , which can range up to @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , it is known to be replete with an estimated 2,600  @xmath14  400 ob stars , including 120  @xmath14  20 o - type stars , and have a total inferred mass of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the region has been the focus of several studies at a variety of wavelengths , dating back to @xcite , who initially noticed a clustering of 11 blue giants near @xmath16 cygni .",
    "@xcite were the first to obtain accurate spectral types , finding 10 to be o - type and one to be an early b - type star .",
    "the subsequent discovery of the heavily reddened and extremely luminous star cyg ob @xmath1712 @xcite was followed by seven @xcite and then 12 additional early - type stars @xcite .",
    "the first comprehensive study of the morphology of the association estimated more than 3,000 total members , of which at least 300 are early - type ( ob ) stars , and a total mass of @xmath18 @xcite .    the first synoptic optical study of vi cygnus produced _ ubv _ photometry of 799 stars in the region and obtained spectral types for 76 stars , most of which are the brightest and bluest members of the association @xcite .",
    "they found a distance of 1.7 kpc and the slope of the imf to be @xmath19 .",
    "this provided the first photometric catalog of cyg ob2 and spectroscopically identified the largest number of ob association members .",
    "@xcite performed the first variability survey of the region , obtaining _",
    "i_-band photometry of the central 6 @xmath20 12 arcmin@xmath21 .",
    "they found 29 variables , five of which are o - type , and at least five eclipsing binaries .",
    "@xcite studied the region using 2mass data to characterize the stellar population .",
    "they aver an imf slope of @xmath22 and assert that the large total mass , high central density , and overall compactness of the region require that it be classified as a young globular cluster , a claim originally made by @xcite .",
    "precise classification notwithstanding , early - type members continued to be discovered spectroscopically in the region .",
    "@xcite used 2mass photometry to identify hundreds of potential early - type stars and spectroscopically found 77 of them to be early - type members .",
    "of those , 31 had prior classifications , 24 of which are o - type and the remaining seven b - type , causing them to extrapolate that a total of 60 of their sample of 77 are o - type stars and that cyg ob2 contains between 90100 total o - type stars .",
    "@xcite took spectra of 14 of the remaining 46 and identified all 14 to be early - type , perhaps indicating that the remaining 31 ( one was discovered to have been previously studied ) are also early - type .",
    "@xcite then extrapolated the locally derived cluster luminosity function to argue that there could be tens or even one hundred similar massive open clusters within the milky way .",
    "recently , @xcite built off the canonical optical study of @xcite , spectroscopically following up 183 of their photometrically observed cyg ob2 members .",
    "seventy - three possessed extant spectral classifications as ob stars and 73 of the remaining 110 were also found to be ob stars . among these they flagged 36 probable and nine possible single - lined spectroscopic binaries ( sb1s ) as well as three new and eight candidate double - lined spectroscopic binaries ( sb2s ) .",
    "several additional binaries have been discovered in the cyg ob2 region in the past few years .",
    "@xcite presented orbital solutions for two sb1s and one sb2 that they had identified as sb - candidates in their earlier work .",
    "cygnus ob2 @xmath23 , a non - thermal radio - emitter , was confirmed as a binary @xcite , supporting the theoretical wind - wind collision scenario .",
    "two ebs in the cyg ob2 region were found via data in the nsvs survey @xcite .",
    "@xcite determined the orbital parameters of four additional ob sbs .",
    "this brings the total number of known ob binary systems with full photometric and/or spectroscopic solutions within cyg ob2 to 18 .",
    "furthermore , the uncertainty regarding the age and star - formation history of cyg ob2 makes this cluster all the more intriguing .",
    "the abundance of heavily - reddened early - type stars found by @xcite initially suggested a single epoch of star formation and a corresponding age of 13 myr .",
    "several of the early - type candidates identified by @xcite were confirmed as ob stars by @xcite , but their dubious status as cluster members casts doubt on the 11.5 myr age that their membership would necessitate .",
    "@xcite goes on to question the membership status of the remaining stars in the @xcite sample , and the presence of evolved o - stars such as the supergiant cyg ob2 @xmath179 requires an age of at least 3 myr .",
    "more recently , iphas observations by @xcite revealed a clustering of @xmath3200 a - type dwarfs primarily to the south of cyg ob2 and within the 57 myr age range .",
    "@xcite used the same method of @xcite to investigate an annular region between 1 and 2 degrees whose center lies slightly to the north of cyg ob2 .",
    "they uncovered a diffuse spread of evolved early - type stars wtih ages up to @xmath310 myr that they identify as likely being field population stars .",
    "finally , @xcite used isochrone fits to nir color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) to derive ages of 3.5 and 5.25 myr for their two fields .",
    "given the large spread in ages , it is unclear whether the central core of cyg ob2 is merely the latest in a series of epochs of star formations , if it is the product of a parent cluster , or if the populations of older and more evolved stars are simply not cluster members .",
    "the cygnus ob2 association is also interesting as a source of high - energy ( @xmath24mev ) emission . due to limitations of angular resolution , most observations thus far can not clearly separate cyg ob2 from nearby parts of the cygnus region more generally .",
    "this region is bright in gamma rays from both point sources and diffuse emission , ranging from the mev to the gev to the tev @xcite .",
    "neutrinos and gamma rays from this region will be important for testing models of cosmic ray production @xcite . with present and future instruments",
    ", it should be possible to better resolve the young cyg ob2 , which would allow the isolation of the high - energy emission from pre - explosion massive stars as opposed to post - explosion remnants .",
    "this paper describes the findings of the first deep optical two - band ( _ _ r__@xmath25 , _ _",
    "i__@xmath25 ) photometric variability survey of the cygnus ob2 region .",
    "we find 121 variables and provide variable classifications for them . in @xmath26 we give a full description of the photometric observations .",
    "the details of the photometric calibration and light curve production are in @xmath27 .",
    "we present the results of the variability search in @xmath28 and discuss the different variability classes separately .",
    "we match our variability catalog to the 2mass point source catalog in order to find nir counterparts and then to a recent x - ray survey of cyg ob2 @xcite , both of which are discussed in @xmath29 .",
    "finally , @xmath30 summarizes the results of the survey and future directions of the project .",
    "the data were obtained on the mdm 1.3 m telescope using the 4k imager , which has a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath0 and a pixel scale of @xmath31 per pixel .",
    "the observations consist of 60s exposures taken through the cousins _ r_-filter and 10s exposures taken through the cousins _",
    "the data were collected over 19 nights during the fall of 2007 , spanning september 12 - october 24 , and 18 nights during the summer of 2009 , spanning may 30 - june 25 .",
    "two pointings were used to provide greater spatial coverage of the cygnus ob2 region .",
    "the first field was centered at ( @xmath32 ) and the second field to the north at ( @xmath33 ) , both chosen in order to cover the central core of the cluster and coincide with the study of @xcite .",
    "table  [ obs ] gives an overview of the observations .",
    "figure  [ fig : fichart ] shows a 2 @xmath20 2 deg@xmath21 image of the cygnus ob2 region with overlays of this study , the previous variability study of @xcite , and the x - ray survey of @xcite .      we apply basic ccd reductions using a custom software pipeline developed by jason eastman .",
    "the routine performs overscan subtraction , trims the images , and uses dome flats to flat field the data .",
    "the 4k chip suffers from crosstalk contamination , a subtle but insidious effect , and so the procedure was modified to properly correct for this .",
    "crosstalk results from the chip being divided into four quadrants of equal pixel size that are read out by four different amplifiers simultaneously . during the readout phase ,",
    "signal from bright stars being read out on a given quadrant , referred to as the source quadrant , will reverberate through the electronics and leave residual signal on the other three quadrants , called victim quadrants .",
    "the source signal is reflected across the three axes of symmetry of the chip , making the contamination predictable and predominantly tractable .",
    "before the residual signal can be removed , a set of crosstalk coefficients , which specify the fraction of the source signal that is reflected onto each victim quadrant , must be calculated .",
    "the coefficients are small enough ( @xmath34 ) that the problem can be sufficiently dealt with via a simple solution . using a set of a few hundred images of our data from both the 2007 and 2009 seasons , we find that the coefficients are not only constant in the count regime 45000 @xmath35 counts @xmath36 65535 , but also stable across the two - year baseline .",
    "information can not be backed out of reflected signals due to saturated ( 65535 counts on the 4k imager ) sources , so pixels contaminated by saturated stars are set to zero , removed from the light curves , and otherwise ignored .",
    "we use astrometry.net @xcite to do astrometry and we extract photometry using the isis package @xcite in conjunction with the daophot / allstar package @xcite , the procedural details of which are discussed in @xcite and @xcite",
    ". we did not observe standard stars , so this requires that we match to other calibrated catalogs and apply a computed magnitude offset . for the _ r_-band data we match our full catalog to an overlapping region of stars observed by the iphas survey @xcite .",
    "we uniquely match six stars from their catalog to ours using a matching radius of 1@xmath37 .",
    "we then apply the transformation equation given by lupton et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , @xmath38 to transform the iphas sdss magnitudes into cousins _",
    "r_-band magnitudes . from this",
    "we derive the magnitude offset and calibrate our _ r_-band data . to calibrate our _ i_-band data with the catalog of @xcite we use a more stringent star selection , as there is more spatial overlap between the two data sets . for a star to be used for the calibration",
    ", it has to satisfy the following criteria : 1 ) have a unique match within 1@xmath37 , 2 ) have no additional matches within 5@xmath37 , 3 ) not be classified by them as a variable , and 4 ) not be saturated or blended in our own database .",
    "this ultimately leaves 133 stars that we then use to calibrate our _ i_-band data .",
    "as each of our fields has a different reference frame , there is a slight magnitude offset between fields that can be calculated using stars in the overlap region .",
    "we perform a variability search using the vartools light curve analysis program @xcite .",
    "we employ both analysis of variation ( aov ) @xcite and lomb - scargle ( ls ) @xcite period search algorithms .",
    "we then inspect light curves with high significance by eye to find periodic variables and use the stetson variability index @xcite to select irregular variable stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : sigma ] shows the light curve rms as a function of reference magnitude for our 23,561 @xmath4-band light curves and 12,611 @xmath39-band light curves .",
    "we find variables as deep as @xmath40 and @xmath41 and go fainter in @xmath4 due to the longer exposure time .",
    "many stars with high rms are not listed as variable because we establish the criterion that stars must exhibit simultaneous two - band variability , which eliminates false positives and mitigates any potential residual effects of crosstalk contamination from saturated sources . as described in @xcite",
    ", stars displaying variability in only one band will have a variability index near zero .",
    "only stars that exhibited clear two - band variability are selected , 121 in total .",
    "prior to discussing the parameters of the variables , the various naming conventions must be explained .",
    "@xcite numbered the first 11 stars discovered in cyg ob2 , a system that @xcite expanded for star number 12 , @xcite for stars 1319 , and @xcite for stars 2085 .",
    "we follow the convention of the literature , which is to precede these stars with schulte .",
    "all variable stars in the gcvs are identified as such .",
    "the primary numbering system is that of @xcite , for which the designation mt91 precedes star i d numbers , from 1799 .",
    "the variability study of @xcite extends this system to 975 , and is referred to as mte ( mt91 extended ) .",
    "the designations a36 and a45 ( gsc 0316100815 , 2mass j20294666 + 4105083 , respectively ) arise from the convention introduced by @xcite and followed by @xcite .",
    "stars within our own variability catalog are given a varid , and numbers increase from brightest to faintest mean @xmath4-band magnitude .",
    "@xcite performed the first variability survey of the region , detecting 455 stars in _ i_-band and finding 29 of them to be variable , including five ebs and five o - type stars .",
    "our study goes much deeper , covers significantly more area , and furthermore provides a two - band photometric catalog .",
    "we identify 121 stars that exhibit variability in both _",
    "r_- and _ i_-band . of these , 10 are ebs , nine of them newly discovered , 17 are eb - candidates , 20 are potential herbig ae / be stars , and 52 are pulsating stars .",
    "we first discuss the results of matching our catalog to the literature",
    ". then we discuss each variability class individually : first the ebs and eb - candidates , then the pulsating variables , and finally the potential herbig ae / be stars .",
    "we find 121 stars to be variable in both _",
    "r_- and _ i_-band within the cygnus ob2 association .",
    "after doing a literature search , we match our catalog to all previously known variable stars in cyg ob2 , listed in table  [ photvar ] , using a matching radius of 1@xmath37 . of the 30 known variable stars in cyg ob2 , we recover variability in at least one band for nine of them .",
    "seven stars are without matches while the remaining 14 are either saturated , photometrically constant , or outside our fov . we discuss those with matches here .",
    "v2186 cyg is an eb of the algol type with a period of 2.9788 days @xcite .",

    "i_-band , with the overall shape of the light curve resembling that of a long period variable .",
    "schulte 57 , varid 020 in our catalog , was previously classified as a variable of unknown type with a 0.728 day period .",
    "we recover the period in both bands and classify it as a pulsating star .",
    "the remainder of the stars discussed here are part of the mte system , introduced by @xcite to extend the catalog from 799 to 975 stars .",
    "they report mte 831 to be irregular with an _",
    "i_-band amplitude of 0.22 mag .",
    "it matches to our varid 050 , with a 10 day period and a 0.3 mag amplitude in both _ r_- and _ i_-band .",
    "mte 849 ( varid 021 ) is an eb of the algol type .",
    "we report a period of 2.89 days , the first known for this system .",
    "mte 876 ( varid 036 ) , previously a variable of unknown type , appears to have a characteristically pulsating light curve , with a period of 1.53 days and a 0.1 mag amplitude .",
    "we agree with their classification of mte 900 ( varid 038 ) , which varies erratically with an amplitude of 1.0 mag on long timescales , perhaps indicating that it is an irregular or long - period variable .",
    "mte 916 ( varid 011 ) similarly appears to be a long - period variable , though with a smaller 0.3 mag amplitude .",
    "@xcite classify mte 973 as a potential eb , and we find it to be constant in _ r_-band but to have a 0.2 amplitude and a 0.88 day period in _",
    "i_-band , though with no obvious eclipsing signature .",
    "in addition to the eight previously known ebs within cyg ob2 , there are 13 ob sbs in cyg ob2 , four of which are single - lined and 11 of which are double - lined .",
    "it should be noted that a few of these spectroscopic systems are also definite or possible eclipsing systems .",
    "those that are confirmed ebs , schulte 27 and a36 , are treated here as photometric variables .",
    "those that are unconfirmed , mt372 and schulte 3 , are included here only as sbs .",
    "of the 121 stars we identify as photometrically variable , 10 are ebs and 17 are eb - candidates .",
    "figure  [ fig : lc.ebs ] shows sample light curves for four of the ebs and figure  [ fig : lc.ebcands ] shows four of the eb - candidates .    to determine if any of our variable stars are sbs , we match to all confirmed and potential sbs found in the literature , most of which are from the catalog of @xcite .",
    "they present spectroscopic data for 146 ob stars within cyg ob2 , all initially discovered by @xcite , and find 73 new ob stars . restricting themselves to the 120 stars with the best data , they identify 36 probable and nine possible sb1s and three new and eight possible sb2s .",
    "table  [ specbin ] lists confirmed and potential sbs within cyg ob2 .",
    "given that the catalog of @xcite reaches a limiting magnitude of @xmath42 and our upper limit is @xmath43 , the vast majority of the stars are saturated in our catalog , and thus we find no matches .",
    "we find 52 of our stars to be pulsating variables , with @xmath4-band amplitudes ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 magnitudes .",
    "figure  [ fig : lc.pulse ] shows sample light curves of four of the pulsating variables .",
    "the periods range from @xmath30.05 to @xmath360 days .",
    "a histogram of the period distribution from 0 to 20 days is shown in figure  [ fig : perhist ] .",
    "initially identified by @xcite , herbig ae / be stars are pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars with masses @xmath44 and are the intermediate - mass analogs of t tauri stars . as a class their spectra display strong balmer emission lines and they additionally exhibit significant infrared excess relative to the stellar photospheric continuum , attributed to emission from circumstellar gas and dust @xcite .",
    "herbig ae / be stars are further characterized by aperiodic large - amplitude ( up to 4 mag ) variability with minima that initially redden and subsequently undergo a color turnaroundas the star becomes bluer as it gets fainter @xcite .",
    "they are catagorized within the class of uxors ( named after ux orion ) , since it is thought that there is no intrinsic difference between the two @xcite .",
    "we flag 20 of our variables as potential herbig ae / be stars .",
    "eight of these show large - amplitude ( @xmath452.0 mag ) variations while five of the remaining vary with lower amplitudes ( @xmath461.0 mag ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : herbig.amphist ] shows a histogram of @xmath4-band magnitude ranges for all 20 potential herbig ae / be stars .",
    "the most interesting features are the dip in amplitude in the medium amplitude range ( 1.52.0 mag ) , the subsequent rise in amplitude ( 2.02.5 mag ) , and the presence of multiple ( two ) large - amplitude ( @xmath453.0 mag ) variables . considered as a whole , the amplitude distribution for these potential herbig ae / be stars in cyg ob2 is in agreement with that found by @xcite , including the three aforementioned features .",
    "several of our candidates display variations strikingly similar to known herbig ae / be stars .",
    "four follow the pattern of misv1147 @xcite , in which there are two distinct states . the stars exhibit a calm state with variations of small ( @xmath47 mag ) amplitudes and also experience fading episodes with deep minima of @xmath31 ( varid 041 ) , @xmath32 ( varids 087 , 100 ) , and even @xmath33 + ( varid 116 ) magnitudes . figure  [ fig : herbig116 ] shows a two - band light curve of such an object .",
    "many of the remaining candidates more closely resemble rr tau , spending roughly equal amounts of time at different magnitude levels @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : herbig038 ] shows an example light curve of a continuously active star .",
    "the easiest way to confirm these as herbig ae / be stars would be to obtain spectra that display h@xmath8 emission , as well as other balmer emission lines .",
    "spectral classification that would identify these as k0 or earlier would at the least confirm them as intermediate - mass stars , though the lack of periodic signals that we find in their light curves is consistent with the results of @xcite and perhaps indicates that these candidates similarly lack the surface hot or cool spots that are common among lower - mass pms stars and that evince themselves as periodic modulations in the light curves .",
    "a population of herbig ae / be stars embedded within the central core of cyg ob2 would help to constrain the age of the cluster . without further spectral information , however , the true status of these stars remains unconfirmed .",
    "cyg ob2 suffers from high and variable extinction , @xmath48 520 magnitudes @xcite , that is largely mitigated when observing in ir or nir wavelengths .",
    "we extract all 2mass @xcite point sources within 30@xmath49 of the center of our survey and remove any with errors @xmath450.2 mag or a null value in any band ( _ j _ , _ h _ , or _ k _ ) , leaving 25,012 total sources . using a matching radius of 1@xmath37 we find unique matches to 99 ( @xmath382% ) stars in our variability catalog .",

    "the high extinction in the region can also be obviated with x - ray observations , as x - rays can penetrate extinction up to @xmath50 @xcite .",

    "eight of our ebs and eb - candidates that match and have mass estimates appear to be low - mass ( @xmath36few  m@xmath52 ) , while two are of intermediate ( 28@xmath51 ) mass .",
    "the sample of our ebs and eb - candidates with mass estimates is incomplete , but such a diagnostic would be useful for constraining the binary fraction among high - mass early - type stars .",
    "in this work we present a catalog of photometrically variable stars in the cygnus ob2 association . after generating _ r_- and _",

    "we find 10 eclipsing binaries ( ebs ) , 17 eb - candidates , and 20 potential herbig ae / be stars , with most of the rest constituting an assortment of short and medium period pulsating variables .",
    "follow - up work is underway to obtain spectra of the potential herbig ae / be stars , as h@xmath8 emission would be conclusive proof of their classification and help constrain the age of cyg ob2 .",
    "additionally , obtaining spectral types of the ebs and eb - candidates would be useful for constraining the binary fraction of massive stars .",
    "cyg ob2 has the largest number of spectroscopically identified o stars ( currently 65 ) as well as a high concentration of as many as 2,400 ob stars @xcite , making it an excellent target for finding massive binaries .",
    "additionally , accurate mass determinations of these potential early - type stars could add to the total number of known ob stars in cyg ob2 and also provide evidence for or against the proposed propensity of massive binaries to form as twins , with a mass ratio near unity @xcite .",
