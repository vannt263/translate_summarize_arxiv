    "fractional revival ( fr ) is observed when clones of a wave packet reproduce with periodicities in a localized fashion @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has been shown to occur in xx spin chains with pre - engineered couplings .",
    "specifically , in such instances , a state with a spin up initially at one end of the chain evolves after some time @xmath0 into a state for which the amplitude to find the spin up at a given site is non zero only for the two ends of the chain .",
    "the special case when the spin up localizes exclusively at the end of the chain at some time @xmath0 is referred to as perfect state transfer ( pst ) .",
    "( see and references therein . )",
    "this has cast xx spin chains as attractive systems for the design of wires that can transport quantum information with high fidelity , generate entanglement or provide remote gates .",
    "the interest in these questions is generating an abundant literature ( see @xcite for reviews and further references ) .",
    "a key advantage of these models is that the tasks are performed through the chain dynamics without the need for external control operations beyond the input / output interventions .",
    "a systematic analysis of fr at two sites in xx spin chains has been carried in @xcite . in general , fr is essentially described by two parameters that can be tuned independently .",
    "the first is connected to a prescribed one - parameter deformation @xcite .",
    "the second comes from a remarkable analytic model .",
    "let us briefly explains its features .    for the purpose of studying fractional revival it suffices to consider states with only one spin up .",
    "when restricted to the one - excitation sector , the xx spin chain hamiltonians with nearest - neighbor couplings become tridiagonal matrices @xmath1 that are diagonalized by polynomials orthogonal on the finite set of points formed by the eigenvalues of @xmath1 .",
    "one necessary condition for pst is that the matrices @xmath1 possess a special property called mirror - symmetry .",
    "if one looks for fractional revival in systems with special hamiltonians whose restrictions @xmath1 are mirror - symmetric , one generically obtains analytic models where the couplings and magnetic fields are exactly given by the recurrence coefficients of polynomials that are orthogonal on linear bi - lattices . by a linear bi - lattice we mean the set of points obtained by shifting two equally - spaced linear lattices with respect to one another : @xmath2 we assume that the chains have @xmath3 sites .",
    "interestingly , the associated orthogonal polynomials have only been discovered recently in the context of pst studies .",
    "they have been called para - krawtchouk polynomials .",
    "the corresponding fr parameter is related to the relative shift @xmath4 .",
    "now there is a procedure known as spectral surgery that allows to remove spectral points while preserving mirror - symmetry . in principle",
    "this permits to obtain any prescribed spectrum for @xmath1 and the corresponding mirror - symmetric couplings and magnetic fields by removing in this way the appropriate elements from the linear bi - lattice set . as explained in @xcite , upon performing the isospectral deformation ( mentioned above ) of surgered models",
    ", one may construct all xx spin chains with fr .",
    "the usefulness of exactly solvable models does not need to be stressed .",
    "they make possible the analytic exploration of the dynamics and are rooted in a secular tradition in theoretical physics .",
    "now it is a fact that the repeated removal of energy levels will yield expressions that are more and more complicated for the chain data and will thus have the effect of obscuring the analytic properties of the system .",
    "there is hence much interest in finding directly other manifestly analytic models with fr and this is the purpose of this paper .    the discovery of the para - krawtchouk polynomials orthogonal on linear bi - lattices has prompted the search for polynomials orthogonal on quadratic bi - lattices .",
    "these functions have been found very recently @xcite .",
    "they have been called the para - racah polynomials and are denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "as the notation suggests , they depend on 3 parameters , two of which being related to the definition of the grid or bi - lattice , in addition to the natural number @xmath6 .",
    "we shall here discuss the fractional revival properties of the xx spin chains associated to these orthogonal polynomials .",
    "mirror - symmetry requires @xmath7 . when this is so",
    ", fr will occur provided @xmath8 and @xmath9 are expressed in terms of solutions of a quadratic diophantine equation .",
    "pst will happen for a subset of the values of the parameters for which fr is realized .",
    "when @xmath10 , the models will be seen to reduce to the ones associated to the dual - hahn polynomials - a paradigm example of chains exhibiting pst . when an isospectral transformation is applied , mirror - symmetry is broken and more general models with fr are obtained and found to correspond to para - racah polynomials now with an arbitrary @xmath11 .    the paper will unfold as follows . in section 2",
    ", relevant aspects of fractional revival in xx spin chains will be reviewed .",
    "the models with mirror - symmetric couplings and magnetic fields corresponding to the recurrence coefficients of the para - racah polynomials with @xmath7 will be introduced in section 3 for @xmath6 odd , that is for an even number of sites .",
    "the conditions ( on the parameters ) for fractional revival to take place will be determined and the situations of pst will also be identified .",
    "the presentation of the models for @xmath6 even will be carried out via the spectral surgery procedure .",
    "this last point will be the object of section 3 where we shall give the couplings and magnetic fields that result when the last level of the chains with @xmath6 odd is removed . that the models reduce to the one associated with the dual - hahn polynomials",
    "will be discussed in section 5 .",
    "the shape of the couplings and magnetic fields will be depicted in plots exhibiting the differences between the odd and even @xmath6 cases as well as with the dual - hahn polynomials situation .",
    "the isospectral deformation of the mirror - symmetric chains considered up to that point will be carried out in section 6 to find analytic models with fr corresponding to the general para - racah polynomials .",
    "the classification will be done in full generality for spin chains with @xmath12 .",
    "we shall sum up to conclude .",
    "we shall consider @xmath13 spin chains with @xmath3 sites and nearest - neighbor interactions governed by hamiltonians @xmath14 of the form @xmath15 @xmath16 is the coupling constant between the sites @xmath17 and @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the magnetic field strength at the site @xmath18 , with @xmath20 .",
    "the symbols @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 stand for the pauli matrices with the index @xmath18 indicating on which @xmath24 copy of @xmath25 they act .",
    "it is easy to see that the hamiltonian @xmath14 is invariant under rotation around the z - axis : @xmath26=0 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this implies that the eigenstates of @xmath14 split in subspaces labeled by the number of spins over the chain that are up , i.e. that are eigenstates of @xmath27 with eigenvalue @xmath28 . to study fractional revival it suffices to focus on the restriction @xmath1 of @xmath14 to the one - excitation sector .",
    "the states of that subspace are naturally described by the canonical basis vectors of @xmath29 @xmath30 with the single @xmath31 in the @xmath32 position corresponding to the single spin up at the @xmath32 site .",
    "the action of @xmath1 in that basis follows from and is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is assumed .",
    "that is , @xmath1 is the following jacobi matrix @xmath35 it will be said to be mirror - symmetric with respect to the anti - diagonal or persymmetric if @xmath36 with @xmath37 in terms of the couplings and magnetic field strengths , this amounts to @xmath38 since @xmath39 , @xmath1 is clearly hermitian and has real eigenvalues .",
    "we can introduce the eigenbasis of @xmath1 : @xmath40 where the eigenvalues @xmath41 are assumed to be non - degenerate and are taken to be in increasing order @xmath42 .",
    "then , in view of , it is easy to show that we have the following expansions @xmath43 where @xmath44 are orthonormal polynomials on the finite set of spectral points @xmath41 that obey the recurrence relation @xmath45 it can be shown that @xmath1 is persymmetric if and only if @xmath46 let us now come to fractional revival at two sites . a wave packet initially localized at the site @xmath47",
    "will be revived at sites @xmath47 and @xmath6 after time @xmath0 if @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "given the normalization condition and the inconsequential overall phase , we see that fractional revival at two sites is essentially characterized by two real angles .",
    "observe that we are in a situation of perfect state transfer when @xmath50 : @xmath51 with the help of expansion , it is immediate to see that condition translates into @xmath52 note that for the right hand side of to have modulus 1 , we must have @xmath53 the implications of have been examined in @xcite to obtain a characterization of the chains with fr .",
    "the analysis proceeds in two steps .",
    "condition is first enforced when @xmath54 and @xmath55 involve only one of the two essential angles ( apart from the global phase @xmath56 ) and are expressed like this : @xmath57 the additional parameter is then introduced by subsequently performing an isospectral deformation of the jacobi matrix obtained as a result of the first step .",
    "this course will be followed here .",
    "when @xmath54 and @xmath55 take the special form , we see from that @xmath58 . simple considerations ( explained fully in @xcite ) lead one to conclude that condition must then be obeyed . in other words , the fractional revival condition requires that @xmath1 be persymmetric when @xmath54 and @xmath55 are as in .",
    "moreover , with these expressions for @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the real and imaginary parts of yield the following relations that the eigenvalues @xmath41 of @xmath1 must satisfy :    [ 19 ] @xmath59    the determination of @xmath1 and of @xmath14 as a result , is henceforth framed as an inverse spectral problem that can be solved using the theory of orthogonal polynomials .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath41 found to verify the fr conditions determine the characteristic polynomial of degree @xmath3 and the knowledge of @xmath60 at the @xmath3 points @xmath41 , as prescribed by , completely specifies this polynomial also .",
    "all the other polynomials @xmath44 can be constructed from these two by using the euclidian algorithm ( see ) and this gives @xmath1 and @xmath14 .    the generic set of eigenvalues satisfying conditions is a linear bi - lattice and the algorithm we just explained leads in this case to the para - krawtchouk polynomials .",
    "the specifications of the chain are then provided by the recurrence coefficients .    in the following",
    ", we shall not adopt this deductive approach which is explained fully in @xcite .",
    "we shall rather identify a new analytic model by proceeding in the reverse .",
    "we shall first provide a set of mirror - symmetric couplings and magnetic fields known to form the recurrence coefficients of polynomials that are orthogonal with respect to quadratic bi - lattices .",
    "we shall then determine for what values of the grid parameters are the fr conditions satisfied .",
    "the isospectral deformations that allow to relax the condition that @xmath1 is persymmetric will be presented in the last section .",
    "the analytic model introduced here is based on the para - racah polynomials @xmath61 .",

    "it can be checked directly that these @xmath67 and @xmath68 satisfy and that they hence form a persymmetric matrix .",
    "the para - racah polynomials are known @xcite to satisfy a discrete orthogonality relation on the points of the quadratic bi - lattice defined by @xmath69 now , fr will be observed when such eigenvalues obey conditions . splitting the even and odd cases and using @xmath70 , fr requires that    @xmath71    for @xmath72 .",

    "the proof is elementary and we omit it .",

    "first , the coefficients of @xmath92 yield @xmath93 which says that @xmath94 is a positive integer , that @xmath95 and @xmath90 must share the same parity and that the time for fr to occur is a multiple of @xmath96 .",
    "second , in view of , the coefficients of @xmath76 give @xmath97 the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 are thus rational numbers .",
    "recall that @xmath65 and @xmath66 implying that @xmath98 third , equating the constant terms provides    @xmath99    it is helpful to consider the sum and difference of these two equations :    @xmath100    using and , equation provides a condition on the parameters @xmath88,@xmath90 and @xmath101 : @xmath102\\alpha_1 ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 are integers and @xmath87 is a positive integer .",

    "recall that requires . for fixed",
    "@xmath123 and @xmath107 , given a set of parameters solving , we see that the corresponding model will possess pst in addition if @xmath124 this requires is also possible with @xmath125 but in this instance there will just be replications of pst at times @xmath126 .",

    "it turns out that the solutions with pst can be identified with the models presented by albanese and lawi in an unpublished paper @xcite although the authors have assumed not quite correctly that the underlying polynomials are special cases of the racah polynomials .",

    "remarkably , most of the coupling constants and magnetic fields of @xmath1 remains unchanged .",

    "remembering the expressions and for the entries of @xmath1 , it is seen that the elements of @xmath149 ( @xmath161 and @xmath162 ) correspond to the recurrence coefficients of the para - racah polynomials @xmath61 @xcite with @xmath163 for @xmath6 odd and @xmath164 for @xmath6 even .",
