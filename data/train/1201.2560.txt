    "throughout this section , we fix positive integers @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    ", a map @xmath6 can be defined as @xmath7 the map @xmath6 is called the _ chirotope _ of @xmath5 .",
    "the chirotope @xmath6 encodes the information on the combinatorial type which is called the _ oriented matroid _ of @xmath5 . in this case , the oriented matroid determined by @xmath6 is of rank @xmath0 on @xmath8 .",
    "we note for some properties which the chirotope @xmath6 of a matrix @xmath5 satisfies .    1 .",

    "the third property follows from the identity @xmath16    generally , an oriented matroid of rank @xmath0 on @xmath8 ( @xmath1 points ) is defined by a map @xmath17 , which satisfies the above three properties  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the map @xmath18 is also called the chirotope of an oriented matroid .",
    "we use the notation @xmath19 for an oriented matroid which is on the set @xmath8 and is defined by the chirotope @xmath18 .    an oriented matroid @xmath20 is called _ realizable _ or _",
    ", if there exists a matrix @xmath5 such that @xmath21 .",
    "not all oriented matroids are realizable , but we do nt consider non - realizable case in this paper .    a realization of an oriented matroid @xmath22 is a matrix @xmath5 such that @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "two realizations @xmath25 of @xmath26 is called linearly equivalent , if there exists a linear transformation @xmath27 such that @xmath28 .",
    "here we have the equation @xmath29 .",
    "the realization space @xmath30 of an oriented matroid @xmath26 is the set of all linearly equivalent classes of realizations of @xmath26 , in the quotient topology induced from @xmath31 .",
    "our motivation is as follows : in 1956 , ringel asked whether the realization spaces @xmath30 are necessarily connected  @xcite .",
    "it is known that every oriented matroid on less than @xmath32 points has a contractible realization space . in 1988",
    ", mnv showed that @xmath30 can be homotopy equivalent to an arbitrary semialgebraic variety  @xcite .",
    "his result implies that they can have arbitrary complicated topological types .",
    "in particular , there exist oriented matroids with disconnected realization spaces .",
    "suvorov and righter - gebert constructed such examples of oriented matroids of rank @xmath33 on @xmath34 points , in 1988 and in 1996 respectively  @xcite .",
    "however it is unknown which is the smallest number of points on which oriented matroids can have disconnected realization spaces .",
    "see @xcite for more historical comments .",
    "one of the main results of this paper is the following .",
    "[ mt1 ] there exist oriented matroids of rank @xmath33 on @xmath35 points whose realization spaces are disconnected",
    ".    realization spaces of oriented matroids are semialgebraic varieties .",
    "so it makes sense whether a realization space is irreducible or not .",
    "as far as the author knows , no example of an oriented matroid with a connected and non - irreducible realization space has been explicitly given .",

    "throughout this section , we set @xmath36 .",
    "this is a consequence of the computation of the following construction sequence .",
    "both operations `` @xmath46 '' and `` @xmath47 '' can be computed in terms of the standard cross product `` @xmath48 '' in @xmath49 .",
    "the whole construction depends only on the choice of the three parameters @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51        we can replace @xmath57 with @xmath58 where @xmath59 is chosen from @xmath60 .",
    "we will study the case @xmath61 .",
    "if we choose @xmath59 otherwise , we can get other oriented matroids with disconnected realization spaces .",
    "in the construction sequence , we need no assumption on the collinearity of @xmath62 .",
    "hence every realization of @xmath63 is linearly equivalent to a matrix @xmath42 for certain @xmath64 , up to multiplication on each column with positive scalar .",
    "moreover , we have the rational isomorphism @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",
    "thus we have only to prove that the set @xmath67 is disconnected ( resp .",
    "non - irreducible ) to show that the realization space @xmath68 is disconnected ( resp .",
    "non - irreducible ) .",
    "the equation @xmath69 means that @xmath70 we write some of them which give the equations on the parameters @xmath64 .",
    "note that for all @xmath71 , the sign is given by @xmath72 from the equation @xmath73 we get @xmath74 .",
    "similarly , we get @xmath75 , therefore @xmath76 from the equations @xmath77 , we get @xmath78 moreover , we have the inequalities @xmath79 from the equation @xmath80 , we get @xmath81 conversely , if we have eqs .",
