    "the de sitter ( ds ) and anti - de sitter ( ads ) space has a constant curvature with the maximal symmetry of a given dimension .",
    "the ( a)ds has thus attracted attention in understanding a quantum nature of spacetime and been applied to different physics . the present accelerating universe with a cosmological constant is an asymptotically pure ds space and the early inflationary universe also underwent a quasi - exponential expansion .",
    "the pure ds space has a cosmological horizon and emits the ds radiation with the gibbons - hawking temperature.@xcite the einstein equation for the ds space can be explained by the black hole thermodynamics.@xcite an intriguing feature of the ds radiation is the solitonic nature in the global coordinates in any odd - dimensional ds space.@xcite the discrimination of dimensions for ds radiation can be explained by the stokes phenomenon , in which a pair of instanton actions interferes destructively in odd dimensions and constructively in even dimensions.@xcite the stokes phenomenon can also be explained by the coherent destructive or constructive interference of the superadiabatic particle number.@xcite    the one - loop effective action in an electromagnetic field and in a curved spacetime reveals the interplay between quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and quantum nature of curved spacetime .",
    "a strong electromagnetic field changes the quantum vacuum structure,@xcite and an electric field with / without a parallel magnetic field pulls out virtual particles from the dirac sea and creates pairs of particles and antiparticles known as the schwinger effect.@xcite the schwinger effect in ( a)ds space entails the pair production by the electric field and the ds radiation@xcite or the suppression by the negative curvature of ads space.@xcite the one - loop effective action and the schwinger effect has been comprehensively studied in ref . .",
    "the @xmath0-wave of a scalar field in the nariari geometry of a rotating ds black hole is equivalent to a charge in a uniform electric field in @xmath1.@xcite interestingly , the near - horizon geometry @xmath2 of an extremal or near - extremal black hole deduces that the emission of charges from the black hole is related to the schwinger effect in @xmath3.@xcite the fermionic current due to the schwinger effect@xcite and the holographic schwinger effect@xcite have been studied in the ds space .    the production of particles can be explained by the ( effective ) temperature .",
    "the hawking radiation has the bose - einstein or fermi - dirac distribution with the hawking temperature and the ds radiation has a distribution , whose leading boltzmann factor can be given by the gibbons - hawking temperature .",
    "the schwinger effect in a constant or pulsed electric field has an effective temperature given by the inverse of the period of the instanton action in the euclidean time.@xcite narnhofer , peter and thirring have shown that the effective temperature for an accelerating observer in ds space is the geometric mean of the unruh temperature and the gibbons - hawking temperature,@xcite which is extended to the ads space by deser and levin,@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "recently , cai and kim have shown that the schwinger effect in ( a)ds space also has a thermal interpretation in terms of an effective temperature for the unruh effect for accelerating charge by the electric field and the curvature effect,@xcite as summarized in fig .",
    "this implies that the schwinger effect from an extremal black hole , in which the hawking radiation is suppressed due to the zero temperature , may also have such a thermal interpretation and similarly for a near - extremal black hole.@xcite        in this paper we elaborate the one - loop effective action of scalar qed in ref . and",
    "also advance a method to find the density of states for the one - loop action and the schwinger effect .",
    "in particular , the density of states is important to obtain the one - loop qed action density from the integrated one - loop action in the in - out formalism and the rate of pair production from the mean number by the bogoliubov transformation .",
    "the one - loop effective action is equivalent to all the one - loop diagrams with even number of photons and gravitons , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , whose summation is beyond the computational practicality .",
    "however , in the in - out formalism by schwinger and dewitt , the one - loop action is derived from the scattering amplitude between the in- and out - vacua@xcite @xmath4 in fact , the propagator or green function of the charge in the electric field and in the ( a)ds space gives the scattering amplitude .",
    "we study the one - loop effective action of a scalar with mass @xmath6 and charge @xmath7 in a uniform electric field in the planar coordinates of @xmath1 space @xmath8 and in @xmath3 space @xmath9 the one - loop action differs from quantum electrodynamic interaction by summing feynman diagrams .",
    "the gauge potentials are chosen to have the minkowski space limit ( @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) and the scalar curvature is @xmath12 .",
    "then the momentum mode @xmath13 in @xmath1 has the equation @xmath14 where the dimensionless parameters are @xmath15 on the other hand , the energy mode @xmath16 in the @xmath3 space is given by the equation @xmath17 where another set of dimensionless parameters @xmath18    in the @xmath1 space , the positive and negative solutions for the in - vacuum ( @xmath19 ) are given by the whittaker function as @xmath20 with @xmath21 and those for the out - vacuum ( @xmath22 ) are @xmath23 the solutions ( [ ds in - sol ] ) and ( [ ds out - sol ] ) are chosen to satisfy the quantization rule @xmath24 = i$ ] .",
    "similarly , the solutions for the in - vacuum ( @xmath25 ) for the tunneling boundary condition are @xmath26 with @xmath27 and those for the out - vacuum ( @xmath28 ) are @xmath29 the solutions ( [ ads in - sol ] ) and ( [ ads out - sol ] ) are chosen to satisfy the quantization rule @xmath30 = i$ ] for the tunneling boundary condition.@xcite",
    "using ( [ ds in - sol ] ) and ( [ ds out - sol ] ) , we recalculate the bogoliubov coefficients in the @xmath1 space@xcite @xmath31 and from eqs .",
    "( [ ads in - sol ] ) and ( [ ads out - sol ] ) , we find the bogoliubov coefficients in @xmath3 space @xmath32 hence , the mean numbers of pairs by the schwinger effect are @xmath33 @xmath34 the binding nature of @xmath3 provides an effective mass @xmath35 and thus increases the critical strength @xmath36 while the separating nature of @xmath1 gives @xmath37 and thus lowers the critical strength .",
    "note the breitenlohler - freedman bound @xmath38 for the stability of ads against schwinger emission .",
    "recently , cai and kim have proposed a thermal interpretation of the schwinger effect in the @xmath5 space .",
    "note that the mean number for the ds space is determined by the actions@xcite @xmath39 here the effective temperature and the associated temperature are @xmath40 where the gibbons - hawking temperature and the unruh temperature for the accelerating charge by the electric field are , respectively , @xmath41 on the other hand , the mean number for the ads space is determined by the actions@xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 in the minkowski limit @xmath44 , the mean number reduces to @xmath45 , as expected .",
    "the factor of two is intrinsic nature of the schwinger effect.@xcite",
    "the density of states is necessary to derive the qed action density and the pair - production rate in the in - out formalism . the energy - momentum integral of the off - shell mean number gives the density of states , @xmath46 , for a uniform electric field in the minkowski spacetime.@xcite in the case of a uniform magnetic field",
    ", the wave packet of landau states gives the density of states , @xmath47 .",
    "we now propose another method to find the density of states in the in - out formalism .",
    "for that purpose , we note that the field has the fourier integral @xmath48 using the asymptotic form @xmath49 and changing of variable @xmath50 , we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ fourier ] ) as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a function independent of @xmath53 , and @xmath54 the gaussian integral from the saddle point method gives @xmath55 in the tunneling picture , the decay of the vacuum due to the schwinger effect is determined by the magnitude square of the field @xmath56 and the momentum independent part @xmath57 determines the mean number of created pairs .    therefore , the density of states is given by @xmath58 in the minkowski spacetime @xmath59 the density of states becomes @xmath60 .",
    "finally , we obtain the pair - production rate per unit two - volume @xmath61 the density of state has been proposed for spinor qed in the ds space.@xcite",
    "from the integrated one - loop action ( [ in - out scat ] ) follows the qed action density , which is given by the bogoliubov coefficient , which is in turn expressed by gamma functions with complex arguments @xmath62 to obtain the qed action density , one uses the gamma function in the proper - time integral @xmath63 , \\label{gamma fn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and then applies the schwinger subtraction scheme to regulate divergent terms via the renormalization of the vacuum energy and charge.@xcite remarkably , the consistence relation , @xmath64 , between the imaginary part of the effective action and the pair - production rate , is the consequence of the cauchy s residue theorem applied to the gamma function ( [ gamma fn ] ) . finally , we find the qed action density in the @xmath65 space @xmath66 , \\nonumber\\\\ { \\cal l}^{(1)}_{\\rm ads } & = & \\frac{k^2 \\gamma_{\\rm ads}}{2(2 \\pi ) } \\int_{0}^{\\infty } \\frac{ds}{s } e^ { -\\gamma_{\\rm ads}s } \\cosh(\\bar{\\omega}_0 s ) \\bigl(\\frac{1}{\\sin(s/2 ) } - \\frac{2}{s } - \\frac{s}{12 } \\bigr ) . \\label{(a)ds qed}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
