    "massive stars and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in galaxies produce copious amounts of ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation .",
    "a fraction of these uv photons escape from the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the host galaxy into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , building up an extragalactic uv background ( uvb ) .",
    "following reionization , this uvb keeps the bulk of the igm ionised ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , regulates its temperature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and sets a characteristic virial temperature below which halos do not form galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the uvb is therefore an important ingredient in models of galaxy formation .",
    "moreover , the uvb encodes the cumulative history of star formation and agn activity , and depends on the redshift and luminosity - dependent escape fractions of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a detailed understanding of the time evolution of the spectral shape and intensity of the uvb ( hereafter @xmath7 ) is of critical importance in many areas of astrophysics .",
    "the amplitude of the uvb at redshifts @xmath8 is expected to be more than ten times the present - day value @xcite , and three methods have been used to attempt to measure @xmath9 at these redshifts .",
    "firstly , a background of @xmath1  ionising photons will result in recombination radiation , such as ly@xmath0 , when such photons impinge on optically - thick @xmath1  clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , searches for this ly@xmath0 fluorescence   have remained inconclusive ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the expected intrinsic surface brightness ( sb ) is low , and the signal is furthermore significantly lowered by cosmological redshifting , making this measurement very challenging .",
    "secondly , @xmath9 can be constrained by determining out to which distance a luminous source , such as a quasar , outshines the uvb , via the so - called proximity effect   ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the value inferred for @xmath9 depends on other properties of the system that are difficult to constrain , such as the time - dependence of the luminosity of the source , and the temperature and density structure of its surrounding medium @xcite .",
    "third , constraints on @xmath9 can be derived by comparing the observed transmission statistics of the ly@xmath0 forest to those measured in hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this method , which currently offers the primary constraints on @xmath9 , suffers from systematic uncertainties , because the transmission statistics also depend on the relatively poorly - known temperature - density relation of the photoionized igm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but observing the ly@xmath0 forest requires uv - spectroscopy from space .",
    "the detection of ly@xmath0 fluorescence is challenging because the amplitude of the uvb is low and the igm is more diffuse at these redshifts when compared to @xmath8 .",
    "interestingly , fluorescence could also be detected in h@xmath0 , by observing the ionisation front of neutral @xmath1  clouds photoionized by the uvb @xcite , or in the outskirts of the @xmath1  disks of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite targeted the nearby edge - on galaxy ugc  7321 , obtaining an upper limit on @xmath11 , which is the @xmath1  photoionization rate of the uvb , where @xmath12 is the photoionization cross section and @xmath13 is the frequency corresponding to the ionisation potential of hydrogen . ] . the same group also reported a detection , which has not been published at the time of writing ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the absence of firm observational constraints on @xmath9 , the current parametrisation of",
    "the uvb relies mostly on radiative transfer calculations that follow the build - up of the uvb accounting for sources and sinks of radiation .",
    "these models have input parameters that are difficult to measure , such as the emissivity and escape fraction of ionising photons from massive stars and agn in galaxies , and the distribution of @xmath1  absorbers @xcite .",
    "therefore , different models predict values of @xmath11 that differ by factors of a few , primarily because the observational data that enter the modelling are not well known . such a relatively large uncertainty in @xmath11 then impacts the reliability of other predictions , for example the outcome of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations ( see e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite argue that the value of @xmath9 predicted by @xcite underestimates the uvb at @xmath14 by a factor up to five compared to what is required by the transmission statistics of the low - redshift ly@xmath0  forest .",

    "we describe the results from new observations designed to measure @xmath15 through the experiment proposed by @xcite , who attempted to measure the uvb intensity by searching for the h@xmath0  recombination line arising from gas that is photoionized by the uvb at the edge of the @xmath1  disk in the nearby spiral galaxy ugc  7321 .",
    "the distance to this galaxy is @xmath16 and it has a mostly - unperturbed @xmath1  disk seen edge - on , thus providing the ideal conditions for measuring the h@xmath0 fluorescence induced by the uvb .",

    ", we used the muse wide field mode with slow guiding .",
    "a total of 14 exposures of 1465 s each , totalling 5.7 h on target , were acquired at the position @xmath2512:17:15.3 and @xmath2622:31:16.9 with small offsets and 90 degree rotations in between exposures .",

    "the location of the pointing was chosen to overlap with the region where the sb was expected to be maximal according to the model of @xcite , while sampling a mostly blank sky region in the bottom part of the field of view as well ( see figure [ fig : musefov ] ) .",
    "individual exposures have been reduced using the eso muse pipeline ( v1.6.2 ; * ? ? ? * ) which applies standard calibrations to the raw data , including bias subtraction , flat fielding , flux and wavelength calibrations , and baryocentric corrections .",
    "after the individual exposures have been processed with basic reduction techniques , we produce three final data sets for the subsequent analysis using : i ) the eso pipeline ; ii ) the cubextractor package ( cubex , cantalupo in prep . ) following the procedures described in @xcite and @xcite ; iii ) a custom python post - processing pipeline and the zurich atmosphere purge ( zap ) package @xcite .",
    "each of these three methods applies independent algorithms for the sky subtraction and , in some cases , for additional illumination corrections , allowing us to further test the robustness of our results with respect to different reduction techniques .    in the following ,",
    "fluxes recorded in the data cubes are converted into sb units using the pixel size of @xmath27 .",
    "we also apply a correction for galactic extinction in the direction of ugc  7321 , which we estimate to be @xmath28 from the milky way dust map @xcite . as described in @xcite , the internal extinction of ugc  7321",
    "is believed to have negligible effects at the location of our observations , and it is not considered further . the distance to ugc  7321  is somewhat uncertain , with values reported in the literature ranging from @xmath29 .",
    "we follow @xcite and @xcite in this work and assume a distance of @xmath30 , with a corresponding angular scale of @xmath31 .",
    "we note , however , that our results are based on distance - independent quantities , such as sb and relative separations in the plane of the sky .      for the preparation of the first dataset ( hereafter the eso data cube )",
    ", we perform sky subtraction on the individual exposures using the muse_scipost recipe provided within the eso pipeline . this procedure subtracts a sky model from the data , correcting for local variation of the line spread function ( lsf ) in an attempt to minimise the residuals of bright sky lines .",
    "the sky continuum level is computed internally , by selecting a range of pixels with low illumination to avoid the presence of sources .    following sky subtraction , we align all the exposures relative to each other by using continuum - detected sources as reference .",
    "subsequently , we reconstruct a final data cube using the muse_exp_combine recipe that resamples data on a regular cube of @xmath32  in the spectral directions , and @xmath33 in the two spatial directions . as a last step",
    ", we correct the absolute astrometric solution using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) imaging as reference system @xcite .",
    "we further test the quality of the flux calibration against sdss using galaxies in the field finding good agreement ( within @xmath34 ) .",
    "inspection of the final data cube reveals the presence of sky residuals with amplitude comparable to the signal we wish to detect .",
    "for this reason , we will only use the eso product as a reference grid for computing the astrometric and wavelength solution during the reconstruction of new data cubes that are post - processed with additional software , as described in the following sections .",
    "the second dataset ( hereafter the cubex  data cube ) is prepared using a combination of procedures distributed as part of the cubex  package ( cantalupo in prep . ) . at first , we reconstruct a resampled data cube for each exposure , after it has been processed for basic calibrations using the eso pipeline . at this stage , sky subtraction has not been performed , and we use the eso data cube as a common reference frame for the final astrometric solution of individual exposures .",
    "all the subsequent post - processing techniques are applied to these reconstructed data cubes , thus avoiding multiple interpolations of the data .",
    "the next step uses the cubefix procedure to minimise the residual illumination differences that are not fully corrected by flat fields across the 24 integral field units ( ifus ) which compose the muse instrument .",
    "this correction is achieved by using both the sky lines and the continuum sky emission to rescale slices segment in the spatial direction . ]",
    "relative to each others , also accounting for wavelength - dependent variations .",

    ", the sky is subtracted from the resampled cubes using the flux - conserving cubesharp procedure , which is designed to minimise the residuals arising from variations in the lsf across different ifus .",
    "the above steps are iterated twice using the products of the previous iteration to identify and mask astronomical sources within the cube . to minimise the risk of altering the astrophysical signal during sky subtraction , when computing the normalisation of the sky flux as a function of wavelength with cubesharp , we further mask the top half of the muse fov , where the h@xmath0 signal is expected to lie ( see figure [ fig : musefov ] ) . in the end ,",
    "a final data cube is reconstructed by averaging individual exposures applying a 3@xmath36-clipping algorithm .    .",
    "]      the preparation of the third dataset ( hereafter the zap  data cube ) follows a procedure similar to the one adopted for the cubex  data cube , but using python code we developed to perform the illumination correction and the zap  package @xcite to perform sky subtraction .",
    "as done previously , we resample each exposure after basic reduction with the eso pipeline onto a regular grid , using the eso data cube as reference for the astrometry and wavelength grid . at this stage",
    ", we also produce masks that trace each voxel in the reconstructed cube back to the original muse ifu , retaining also information on the pixel location within stacks . after masking continuum - detected sources",
    ", we use sky regions to map and correct the residual illumination differences first across ifus as a function of wavelength using coarse spectral bins of 100   , and then across stacks collapsing the entire cube into an image .",
    "these corrections are of the order of @xmath37 and , by construction , they preserve the mean flux across the cube as a function of wavelength .",
    "we have verified that the photometric properties of sources detected across the field are preserved when compared to the eso data cube .",
    "a major difference with cubefix is that we do not correct slices individually and we do not separate the contribution of sky lines and sky continuum when computing the scaling factors .    after this step ,",
    "we use the zap  code to perform sky subtraction . as described in @xcite ,",
    "zap  employs principal component analysis ( pca ) to describe and subtract the sky emission within each muse voxel .",
    "as for the cubex  product , we reduce the risk of subtracting astronomical signal by applying a mask in addition to the internal zap  algorithms that minimise the inclusion of pixels with sources in the computation of the pca components . to this end",

    "we exclude pixels at the position of sources detected via continuum emission , a task that is easily achieved thanks to the excellent image quality of muse . to this end",
    ", we run sextractor @xcite on a deep white image that we obtain by collapsing the data cube along the wavelength axis . for this , we choose the cubex  data product as it provides the best image quality given that the illumination correction is performed at the slice level . to ensure that the full extent of the sources are masked down to faint sb levels",
    ", we produce a segmentation map using a low detection threshold , equal to the sky root - mean - square ( rms ) . to avoid the inclusion of spurious sources , the minimum area for source detection",
    "is set to 15 spaxels , corresponding to objects of @xmath39 in diameter .",
    "visual inspection confirms that the segmentation map is successful in masking all the sources where continuum emission is seen in the deep white image .      to better understand the performance of the adopted reduction techniques , and to assess the presence of systematic errors throughout our analysis",

    "the emission line is expected to be unresolved at the moderate resolution of muse ( @xmath56 at these wavelengths ) , but as in @xcite , we assume a conservative window of @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) over which the line can be detected due to variations in the gas velocity field across the muse fov . under the general assumption that the gas is in photoionization equilibrium , the emission line is further expected to have an order of magnitude sb of @xmath59 , with the exact normalisation depending on the uvb photoionization rate and spatial location , as described in sect .

    "to maximise the signal - to - noise ( @xmath60 ) of these maps , we compute the mean sb by summing flux along the wavelength direction while weighting according to a normalised gaussian of width @xmath61 , which is matched to the muse resolution at these wavelengths .",
    "as discussed below , this procedure does not provide the best estimate for the total line flux , but it is suitable for a visual exploration of the presence of signal within maps of maximal @xmath60 .    after applying a two - dimensional ( 2d ) median filter of width 1.2 arcsec , visual inspection of these maps",
    "reveals the presence of extended emission in the north - east ( top left ) corner of the fov in both data cubes , inside the region overlapping with the 21 cm detection .",
    "conversely , no extended emission is found in the top right part of the fov , within the region where the sb is expected to be maximal in the model by @xcite , perhaps with the exception of the edge of the map .",
    "furthermore , the presence of positive fluctuation at the outskirts of the map can be noted in the south - east direction , indicating that artefacts may be present at the edge of the fov .",
    "relying again on visual inspection , we test whether the signal visible in these maps can be attributed to scattered light in one of the muse corners .",
    "having produced the final data cubes by averaging exposures at different position angles , there should be no preferential direction in the final combined cubes and , in principle , any residual illumination pattern should not appear in a single corner .",

    "additional properties of the signal seen in figure [ fig : sbmaps ] can be inferred by inspecting the mean spectra from different apertures .",
    "first of all , in agreement with the results derived from the optimally - extracted 2d maps , an emission line is detected at @xmath41  within the @xmath1  region ( left - hand panels ) .",
    "the significance of this detection exceeds @xmath70 based on statistical errors , here defined as the photon and detector noise that are estimated by propagating the variances of these contributions through the calibration and reduction procedures .",
    "however , the systematic errors are the dominant source of uncertainty , which arises from imperfect calibrations and sky residuals that are not fully corrected by the above procedures .",

    "figure [ fig:1dspec ] reveals that the emission line is detected at the wavelength where h@xmath0  recombination from ugc  7321  is expected , it is visible both in the zap  and cubex  cubes , and it appears in the region enclosed by the @xmath1  contour with @xmath38 .",
    "combined , these three pieces of evidence suggest that the signal seen in figure [ fig : sbmaps ] and figure [ fig:1dspec ] is real and that it is consistent with h@xmath0  emission from the outskirts of ugc  7321 , as expected for gas photoionized by the uvb . finally , no prominent emission is visible inside the cnt1 and the cnt2 regions ( third and fourth panels in figure [ fig:1dspec ] ) , indicating that the positive flux fluctuations that are visible at the west and north edge of the fov in figure [ fig : sbmaps ] are not related to artefacts that can mimic an emission line at the wavelength expected for h@xmath0  recombination in ugc  7321 .",
    "moreover , no prominent signal is detected when inspecting the mean spectra in the max region ( second panels from the left ) , in agreement with what was found in the sb maps . the lack of strong signal inside the region that was predicted to contain the strongest emission in the model by @xcite may appear puzzling at first .",
    "however , as we discuss in detail in sect .",
    "[ sec : uvb ] , this is fully consistent with our revised photoionization model for ugc  7321 .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the model by @xcite overestimated the extent of the @xmath1  profile , predicting a more extended sb profile than is warranted by current data .",
    "this unfortunate mismatch between the model by @xcite and the data has led us to focus our muse observations within a region of lower sb , with the brighter emission being confined in the corner of the fov , in a region that overlaps with the @xmath1  emission detected at 21 cm .",
    "focusing again on the feature at @xmath41 , it is evident from the spectra shown in figure [ fig:1dspec ] that random errors are negligible compared to the systematic uncertainty arising from residuals of bright sky lines .",
    "indeed , the wavelength of the expected signal at @xmath55  falls at just @xmath71  blueward of the @xmath72  sky line , causing a partial blend at the resolution of muse .",

    "we speculate that this effect is due to small errors in the geometric distortion correction and wavelength calibrations at the very edge of the fov .    , but for the mean spectra extracted in the @xmath1  region using independent subsets of exposures obtained at position angles of @xmath73 degrees ( labelled 0 ) and @xmath74 degrees ( labelled 90 ) .",

    "firstly , we compare the shape of the @xmath41  line with the shape of the residuals associated with the subtraction of the bright sky lines at @xmath76  and @xmath77  ( figure [ fig:1dspec ] ) .",
    "residuals in the zap  reduction , albeit strong , appear to span the entire width of these sky lines .",
    "conversely , the line at @xmath41is offset from , and does not overlap with , the wavelength position of the sky residual associated with the @xmath72  sky line .",
    "a similar behaviour is visible in the cubex  reduction , with positive and negative residuals aligned with the sky lines at @xmath76  and @xmath77 , and a clearly asymmetric profile next to the @xmath72  sky line .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that the emission line at @xmath41  is the strongest feature in these spectra , despite the sky line at @xmath72  being the faintest in this wavelength interval .    as a second test to corroborate the detection of a line at @xmath41 , we analyse independent subsets of exposures as shown in figure [ fig:1dspec_rot ] . to this end , we generate mean spectra in the @xmath1  region after reconstructing two independent data cubes , using half of the total number of exposures . to simultaneously test for subtle systematic errors associated with the instrument rotation , we group exposures according to the instrument position angle . in figure",

    "the reason for the different sb values is attributable to the fact that the cubex  reduction appears to better suppress the sky line residuals when compared with the zap  reduction .",
    "this effect can be quantified using mock data . indeed , for an input mock line of @xmath84@xmath5  at @xmath49 , we recover an integrated signal of @xmath85@xmath5  from the cubex  reduction .",
    "conversely , the zap  reduction yields an integrated sb of @xmath86@xmath5 , revealing that positive residuals of the order of @xmath87@xmath5  are present next to sky lines .",
    "far from the wings of the sky lines ( e.g. at @xmath79 ) , both reduction techniques are able to recover the input line sb to within the associated statistical errors of @xmath88 . based on this analysis , in the following we assume that the cubex  reduction yields a more accurate value for the line sb .    to estimate the amplitude of the systematic uncertainty , we proceed as follows .",
    "first , we measure the sb values for the two independent cubes which we obtain by combining independent sets of data , finding consistent values of @xmath89@xmath5  and @xmath90@xmath5  for the 0 and 90 sets , respectively .",
    "this finding rules out the presence of systematic differences associated with the instrument rotation .",
    "however , by integrating the line sb within the control regions defined above both at @xmath49  and @xmath48 , we find fluctuations which are up to one order of magnitude higher than the quoted variance based on statistical uncertainties . by comparing measurements in these control apertures",
    "we find a dispersion of @xmath91@xmath5 , which we consider a more realistic estimate of the uncertainty of our measurement .",

    "briefly , the ionisation and thermal vertical structure is solved iteratively for an input power - law spectrum with spectral slope @xmath104 .",
    "ionisation equilibrium is achieved by balancing radiative recombinations with photoionization , including the formation and propagation of recombination radiation from h  , he   and he  .",
    "for the thermal structure , photo - heating is balanced by free - free , collisional ionisation and excitation , and recombinations from h  , he  , and he  . in our calculation , we assume a number density ratio @xmath105 .",
    "a current limitation of the model is that we do not include metal lines nor dust .",
    "once the ionisation and thermal state of the gas are known , we compute the h@xmath0  emissivity as @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the proton and electron number densities , and @xmath109 is the effective case a recombination rate taken from @xcite . finally , we derive the @xmath1  column density and the h@xmath0  sb maps from an integration along the line - of - sight of the neutral hydrogen number density and h@xmath0  emissivity .",

    "focusing on the @xmath1  column density profiles , it is evident that the location of the ionisation front - where hydrogen turns from highly ionised ( @xmath131 ) to fully neutral ( @xmath132 ) - moves to smaller radii with increasing @xmath1  photoionization rate .",
    "the associated h@xmath0  sb profile behaves similarly .",
    "the sb is maximal at the location of the ionisation front , drops off rapidly towards larger radii , and slowly towards smaller radii .",
    "gas to the left of the ionisation front is neutral along the midplane ( for @xmath133 ) , and h@xmath0  emission arises from a skin of ionised gas above and below the midplane that is observed in projection at @xmath129 .    given that the shape of the @xmath1  profiles varies with @xmath11 , observations of the location of this ionisation front in @xmath1  maps can be used to constrain the intensity of the uvb ( see also e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , this measurement is clearly degenerate with the structural parameters that define the gas density distribution .",
    "this degeneracy is highlighted in figure [ fig : cnstgamma ] , which shows the @xmath1  and h@xmath0  profiles from a grid of models at constant @xmath134 , but with different parameters describing the structure of the disk .",
    "starting with a fiducial model defined by @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 ( i d 712 ) , we construct a grid varying each parameter one at the time , as shown in figure [ fig : cnstgamma2d ] .",
    "all models are observed at an inclination angle of @xmath135 deg . comparing figure [ fig : cnstdis ] and figure [ fig : cnstgamma ] ,",
    "it is clear that the location of the ionisation front is a sensitive function of the parameters describing the density distribution of the disk , making accurate determinations of the uvb intensity from @xmath1  data alone very difficult . and while the @xmath1  profiles in predominantly neutral regions can be used to constrain the choice of structural parameters for a given galaxy , co - variance among these parameters and@xmath136or local deviations of the density profile from a single exponential may lead to incorrect extrapolations at larger radii , resulting in significant errors on the inferred photoionization rate when using 21  cm data only .",
    "however , figure [ fig : cnstgamma ] shows that the value of the h@xmath0  sb interior to the ionisation front is only weakly dependent on the disk s parameters , in spite of the large scatter in the location of the ionisation front itself or in the shape of the @xmath1  profile .",
    "thus , while @xmath1  data alone provide only weak constraints on the photoionization rate , a joint analysis of the radial @xmath1  column density and the h@xmath0  sb profile has the potential of pinning down @xmath11 to better than a factor of two for fiducial values of @xmath137 ( see below ) .",
    "moreover , by exploiting muse s capability of obtaining spatially - resolved maps of the h@xmath0  sb , one can derive even tighter constraints on the photoionization rate through a joint analysis of the @xmath1  and h@xmath0  maps in two dimensions .",
    "we do not attempt such a detailed analysis here , given the large uncertainty in the current line flux measurements .",
    "thus , in the following , we simply offer a qualitative description of the advantages of resolving the spatial distribution of the h@xmath0  sb .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cnstgamma2d ] , we present the 2d maps for the same models shown in figure [ fig : cnstgamma ] . this gallery visually confirms how models illuminated by a constant uvb with @xmath134 consistently reach a mean sb of @xmath138@xmath5  interior to the ionisation front .",
    "however , differences in the underlying density distribution result in characteristic shapes of the 2d sb maps .",
    "in particular , the location and shape of the brightest regions , which originate from projections effects of the ionisation front , are sensitive to the parameters describing the density distribution and , not shown here , to the viewing angle .",
    "it follows that precise determinations of the @xmath1  photoionization rate are possible provided that one resolves these features in h@xmath0  sb maps , which can be analysed jointly with the @xmath1  column density from 21 cm maps .",
    "following the procedure outlined in the previous section , we combine information from the @xmath1  column density and the h@xmath0  sb maps to translate our measurement into a value of the @xmath1  photoionization rate .",
    "we start by constructing a grid of @xmath139 radiative transfer models for exponential disks , varying the central density in the interval @xmath140 in steps of @xmath141 , the disk scale - length in the interval @xmath142 in steps of @xmath143 , and the disk scale - height in the interval @xmath144 in steps of @xmath145 .",
    "these intervals are chosen to bracket the best - fitting parameters for ugc  7321 , as listed in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "similarly , the step size is chosen to be comparable to the statistical errors on these measurements .",
    "for each combination of disk parameters , we perform the radiative transfer calculation for seven different values of the uvb intensity , @xmath130 .    finally , @xmath1  column densities and h@xmath0  sb maps are reconstructed projecting each model along three viewing angles ( @xmath146 deg ) , with values chosen to bracket the inclination of ugc  7321  in the plane of the sky as determined by @xcite .",
    "we note that the inclination angle of ugc  7321  is uncertain , with @xcite suggesting @xmath147 deg ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this discrepancy reflects the difficulty of measuring inclinations for edge - on disks . in this work ,",
    "we prefer to adopt a lower inclination angle , which appears to better reproduce the aspect ratio of the @xmath1  disk for ugc  7321  at large radii , beyond the optical radius .",
    "we note that progressively higher inclination angles yield brighter and sharper ionization fronts , thus introducing an uncertainty in the inferred value for @xmath11 that is comparable to the error in the sb measurement .",
    "as we discussed qualitatively in the previous section , future observations that can map the extent of the ionization front will be able to reduce this additional source of uncertainty .",
    "next , we select models that best reproduce the available observations by imposing the following two constraints on the grid of projected @xmath1  and h@xmath0  maps .",
    "firstly , we demand that the semi - major and semi - minor axes measured in models at @xmath38 match the observed values of @xmath148 and @xmath149 within the associated errors .",
    "secondly , we require that the h@xmath0  sb computed in models at the same location of our muse observations is consistent with the observed value within the associated errors . after imposing these two constraints ,",
    "three models are found to provide a good fit to both the @xmath1  and the h@xmath0  observations .",
    "the best match , model i d 712 , is shown in figure [ fig : bestfit ] .",
    "the three models that best reproduce the available observations are characterised by disk parameters in the range @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 .",
    "the disk scale - length and scale - height are consistent with the best - fitting parameters inferred by @xcite , obtained by modelling the observed @xmath1  profiles . compared to their analysis , however , our models prefer smaller values for @xmath100 , that , as shown in figure [ fig : cnstgamma2d ] , result in a smaller radius of the ionisation front .",
    "this discrepancy arises from having imposed different constraints on the models . in their analysis , @xcite constrain their model to reproduce the @xmath1  profile at radii between @xmath153 , and they extrapolate the best - fitting model to larger radii .",
    "conversely , in our analysis we impose that the location of the @xmath38 contour in the model is also what is observed in the 21 cm map , without requiring that models track observations in the neutral regions at small radii .",
    "the fact that these different choices yield different best - fitting models is simply because the hi disk in the observed galaxy is not a perfect exponential . given our choice and after simultaneously computing the properties of the @xmath1  and h@xmath0  maps as a function of the @xmath1  photoionization rate , our radiative transfer calculations predict that the maximal emission in ugc  7321  should occur in a region that overlaps with the @xmath1  region ( see figure [ fig : bestfit ] ) , at radii further in than predicted by the model of @xcite .",
    "indeed , their figure 2 suggests that an extrapolation of the best - fitting @xmath1  profile is overestimating the radius of the @xmath1  contour at @xmath38 and , consequently , it is overestimating the extent of the region with maximal sb .",
    "conversely , our self - consistent calculation of the gas ionisation state and emissivity shows that the lack of significant detection in the max region where the maximal emission was originally expected is in fact fully consistent with a model in which gas at the edge of ugc  7321  is photoionized by the uvb .",
    "the models that more closely reproduce observations have @xmath1  photoionization rates in the range of @xmath137 .",
    "we emphasise that this range does not represent a formal confidence interval on @xmath11 , as it simply reflects the photoionization rates of models that are present in our grids and that provide a good description of our observations .",
    "a more formal estimate of the photoionization rate can be obtained , for instance , coupling the results of our radiative transfer code with markov chain monte carlo methods . however , given the large uncertainty currently affecting the measured sb , we defer this approach to future work .",
    "+      before comparing our findings with previous work , we note that the inferred value of @xmath11 should be regarded as a formal upper limit on the uvb photoionization rate . indeed , in addition to recombination from gas photoionized by the uvb , h@xmath0  emission in proximity to a galaxy may arise from photoionization due to local sources or from ionising photons that escape from the inner star - forming disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , processes other than photoionization may operate at the disk - halo transition , as seen for instance within the diffuse ionised medium in nearby galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with current data",
    ", we can not easily constrain the nature of the ionization mechanism , as detailed modelling would require , for instance , the detection of metal lines in deeper exposures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we note , however , that a significant contribution from local sources is unlikely , as muse observations would in fact resolve hii regions with sizes of @xmath154 pc . even accounting for smaller unresolved hii regions at the position of our observations , we do not expect star formation on scales of @xmath155 ( or @xmath156 ) in the outer @xmath1  disk of ugc  7321 .",
    "to assess instead the contribution of ionising photons from the central star - forming regions to the total ionisation budget , we use the starburst99 code @xcite to generate a spectral energy distribution @xmath157 for ugc  7321 . in this calculation",
    ", we assume a star formation rate of @xmath158 based on the observed uv flux @xcite . the maximum contribution of local sources to the photoionization rate at the position of our observations is @xmath159 where the numerical value for @xmath12 is from @xcite , and @xmath160 is the distance from the observed position to the centre of the galaxy .",
    "this calculation ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) implies that massive stars in the disk of ugc  7321  can easily account for , and exceed , the photoionization rate inferred by our observations .",
    "however , by targeting the tip of the @xmath1  disk , we maximise the optical depth seen by ionising photons that leak from the central stellar disk .",
    "as shown by the locations of the @xmath1  contours in figure [ fig : galfov ] , photons leaking along the midplane would see an optical depth at @xmath161  of @xmath162 and , although the small - scale structure of the ism is likely to be very different from that of a simple slab , the presence of column density in excess of @xmath163 makes it quite unlikely that ionising photons escape along the disk s midplane . the assumed geometry for the calculation of the optical depth at the midplane is also justified , to first order , by the fact that ugc  7321  does not exhibit a prominent central bulge and that its disk does not present notable irregularities in the stellar or @xmath1  distribution @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the h@xmath0  emission at the location of our observations is primarily driven by photoionization arising from the uvb .",
    "we think it is unlikely that other sources contribute significantly but can not rule out that ionising photons from the galaxy itself or from other sources contribute as well .",
    "therefore we can only place a formal upper limit on the @xmath1  photoionization rate of the uvb with current data , but we regard our measurement at the edge of the @xmath1  disk as a bona - fide estimate of the intensity of the ionising uvb .      in figure",

    "we have shown how detailed h@xmath0  maps of the ionisation front could be used jointly with @xmath1  maps to precisely constrain @xmath11 . to achieve better measurements of the uvb intensity , future work should however address the following two limitations of the current analysis .",
    "observationally , better precision on the sb measurement is mandatory for improving constraints on the uvb photoionization rate . with the use of mock data",
    ", we have shown that a precision of @xmath171 can be easily achieved with muse in regions close to the centre of the fov and far from sky lines .",
    "thus , thanks to improved predictions of the spatial location of the h@xmath0  emission in ugc  7321(figure [ fig : bestfit ] ) , muse follow - up observations are expected to sample more accurately the location of the ionisation front . also , by observing the east side of the galaxy with a radial velocity of @xmath172 , the h@xmath0  emission line shifts to @xmath173 , in a region away from sky lines .",
    "thus , measurements with errors below @xmath171 should be possible in the near future .",
    "as the precision of observations improves , models should be refined to reliably convert the observed sb into a measurement for the @xmath1  photoionization rate .",
    "the primary effect that should be accounted for in future analyses is the impact of local sources of ionisation .",
    "models that include only the effects of the uvb predict a characteristic shape of the h@xmath0  emission ( figure [ fig : cnstgamma2d ] ) that can be used to test whether the edge of the disk is illuminated by an external radiation field or whether local sources contribute significantly .",
    "ancillary multiwavelength observations for the star - forming disk of ugc  7321  should be used to constrain the spectral energy distribution of local sources that can be added as further contribution to the ionisation budget in radiative transfer models .",
    "additional improvements include the treatment of metals and dust in a full three - dimensional radiative transfer calculation .",
    "to further obviate to the problem of local sources , muse observations can target `` dark '' clouds , where prominent star formation is absent . this experiment has been already attempted , for instance , targeting the intergalactic cloud @xmath1  1225@xmath17401 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "deep muse observations will be able to further improve on current limits on the h@xmath0  sb , reaching levels of @xmath175@xmath5 .",
    "future experiments could also search for the population of `` relhics '' , which are dark and gas - rich halos that are predicted in @xmath176cdm simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given the simple physics that regulates the properties of these dark galaxies , accurate measurements of the uvb intensity should be possible with deep muse follow - up observations .    from our analysis and from these considerations , we conclude that new measurements of the uvb intensity at @xmath14 via h@xmath0  fluorescence appear within reach in the era of large format integral field spectrographs at 8 m class telescopes .",
    "we are grateful to joshua adams for sharing @xmath1  and h@xmath0  contours from @xcite in electronic form .",
    "we thank xavier prochaska , joshua adams , juan uson , and an anonymous referee for useful comments that have improved our work .",
