    "many extragalactic radio jets move with bulk lorentz factors @xmath1 , as evidenced by very short variability timescales , superluminal proper motion of jet features , and dilated particle lifetimes , yet the process that actually accelerates the material is not well known , and neither is the mechanism that collimates the outflow .",
    "one of the first serious models for the large scale dynamics of extragalactic radio jets is the ` twin exhaust ' model ( blandford & rees 74 , br74 throughout the rest of the paper ) . in this model ,",
    "relativistic particle pressure provides the bulk acceleration via conversion of internal to kinetic energy .",
    "the collimation comes from confinement by an external medium , the pressure of which is very likely stratified in the gravitational field of the central black hole and the host galaxy and cluster ( either in a hydrostatic equilibrium configuration or as a wind ) .",
    "pressure balance then dictates the evolution of the jet bulk lorentz factor @xmath2 , and the jet diameter @xmath3 .",
    "however , cooling processes for particles with highly relativistic random motions ( necessary to produce outflows with large bulk lorentz factors @xmath2 ) are very efficient , thus competing with and probably disabling bulk acceleration .",
    "the problem of radiative losses is similarly limiting in the case of radiatively accelerated jets ( phinney 1982 ) .",
    "furthermore , these jets rely on the presence of a strong point - like radiation source ( the terminal lorentz factor is limited by the solid angle subtended by the radiation source due to relativistic aberration ) . the same inverse compton ( ic ) scattering effects that lead to the bulk acceleration",
    "lead to even stronger radiative losses .",
    "in fact , radiation drag can actually decelerate the jet if the external radiation field is isotropic , which leads to both random energy losses _ and _ kinetic energy losses by the same process .",
    "radiative losses are much less limiting if the energy is stored in the magnetic field",
    ". organized magnetic fields have been suggested to provide both acceleration and collimation ( e.g. , blandford & payne 1982 , li , chiueh , & begelman 1992 ) , however , such solutions , in which the collimation is provided by toroidal field , seem to be hampered by instabilities ( begelman 1998 ) .",
    "furthermore , it is difficult to achieve collimation on the basis of magnetic tension alone without contribution from an external pressure source ( begelman 1995 , b95 hereafter ) .",
    "polarization measurements show that the magnetic field in jets is probably _ not _ well organized  the polarization is generally well below the maximal value of @xmath4% ; only in knots does the polarization tend towards this value ( note , however , that interpretations of polarization measurements are often ambiguous , since different field geometries can sometimes lead to the same net polarization ) .",
    "this argues for the presence of largely unorganized , chaotic fields , which could easily account for the high polarization measured in the knots if they are interpreted as shocks , compressing the field in the shock plane ( laing 1980 , b95 ) .",
    "this goes hand in hand with the fact that the field produced in the disk by dynamo processes is expected to be highly chaotic . since the conditions in the jet will likely be controlled by disk physics , we should expect the same statement to be true for the magnetic field in the jet at least close to the disk .",
    "these arguments led us to investigate the dynamics of jets containing large amounts of such disorganized magnetic fields .",
    "the rate of acceleration in a jet propelled by internal ( isotropic ) particle pressure in an external pressure gradient is limited to @xmath5 ( br74 ) , which means that the acceleration to bulk lorentz factors of @xmath6 would occur over length scales @xmath7 for external pressure gradients @xmath8 .",
    "one might think that an anisotropic pressure in the form of chaotic magnetic fields could increase the rate at which the jet is accelerated , if the excess momentum flux is oriented along the direction of the jet . we will show that under a given set of simple assumptions the rate of acceleration is actually the same as in the classic case considered by br74 , i.e. , @xmath9 .",
    "it is unlikely that the magnetic field evolves without some form of dissipation , especially if it is highly unorganized ( reconnection is a diffusive process , so strong gradients in the field , as are present if the field is highly tangled on small scales , will likely lead to increased dissipation ) .",
    "these loss processes can compete with the efficiency of bulk acceleration by removing energy from the flow reservoir .",
    "we will investigate the effects such a tradeoff might have on the dynamics and appearance of jets .",
    "we will lay out the simplifying assumptions going into this model in  [ sec : model ] .",
    "section [ sec : properties ] contains a brief discussion of allowed solutions and the sonic transition of such solutions . in ",
    "[ sec : selfsimilar ] we will discuss self - similar and asymptotic solutions and present some full analytic solutions , including a simple estimate of the effects of radiation drag . section [ sec : discussion ] contains a discussion of the aforementioned tradeoff between dissipation and acceleration , some predicted observational consequences , and an outlook on applications of this model to radio galaxies and @xmath0-ray bursts .",
    "finally , we will summarize our results in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the model we are employing here is closely related to ( and an extension of ) the ` twin - exhaust ' model put forward by br74 .",
    "we adopt a similar scenario under which the jet is launched into a stratified external medium . in the case we are considering ,",
    "turbulent and highly disordered magnetic fields dominate the internal energetics of the jet .",
    "we have tried to illustrate the overall picture we are employing in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] : interstellar magnetic field is advected inward by the accretion disk .",
    "turbulent shear then amplifies the field and tangles it up ( dynamo action ) .",
    "this effect will grow stronger with decreasing distance to the black hole .",
    "eventually , regions of very high field strength will develop .",
    "due to their buoyancy they will accelerate away from the black hole , forming an initial outflow .",
    "this outflow is then collimated by the pressure of the external medium .",
    "the jet channel is constrained by pressure balance , i.e. , the jet will expand or contract in such a way that an equilibrium solution is set up for which the flow is stationary .",
    "as the flow expands , we assume that micro instabilities and turbulence constantly rearrange the field . as in the pure particle pressure case",
    ", the flow can go through a critical point , where the radius @xmath3 has a minimum and beyond which the flow will become self - similar ( if the external pressure itself behaves self - similarly with distance to the black hole ) before the rest mass energy starts dominating the inertia , at which point the jet will reach a terminal lorentz factor @xmath10 . along the way , the field might dissipate energy via reconnection - like processes , and radiation drag might alter the dynamics .",
    "we assume that no energy or particles are exchanged between jet and environment , except for radiative losses .",
    "however , the momentum discharge ( the jet thrust @xmath11 ) need not be conserved along the jet . by assuming that quantities like @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( where a prime denotes that the quantity is measured in the comoving frame ) do not vary significantly across the jet we simplify the analysis to a quasi-1d solution .",
    "we ignore effects of shear at the jet boundaries .",
    "we assume throughout most of the paper that the advected matter is cold ( i.e. , enthalpy density @xmath14 ) .",
    "we are looking for stationary flow along the jet ( i.e. , far from the terminal shock ) , enabling us to drop time derivatives . finally , to make this quasi 1d treatment possible , we will need to make the assumption that the jet is narrow , which in our case implies that the opening angle is small compared to the beaming angle , i.e. , @xmath15 .",
    "as we will later show , this also implies that the jet is in causal contact with its environment ( as required by the assumption that the jet is in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding medium ) .",
    "we use cylindrical coordinates @xmath16 with the @xmath17-axis oriented along the jet axis .",
    "the flow velocity is not aligned with the @xmath17-axis for @xmath18 ( the jet expands ) .",
    "we assume that the sideways velocity is small compared to @xmath19 but non - vanishing , i.e. , the flow is well collimated .",
    "the magnetic field is expressed in a different basis , since the standard basis vectors @xmath20 and @xmath21 are not orthogonal in the comoving frame for @xmath22 .",
    "one axis of this new basis is aligned with the local velocity vector , @xmath23 .",
    "the second unit vector @xmath24 is coincident with the @xmath25-unit vector of the lab coordinate system .",
    "the third unit vector @xmath26 is obtained from the cross product of the other two . in the comoving frame",
    "we have @xmath27 as mentioned before , the 1d approximation is only possible if the opening angle is small compared to the beaming angle .",
    "this is because the lorentz factor will not be nearly uniform across the jet otherwise .",
    "the assumption that @xmath15 simplifies the equations of motion significantly .",
    "following b95 , who investigated similar jets in the non - relativistic limit , we assume that the magnetic field is highly disorganized . in the comoving frame , averages over the individual components and cross terms vanish while the energy density in the individual components is not zero : @xmath28 lorentz transformation of the field to the lab frame ( and to the cylindrical coordinate system aligned with the jet axis ) yields @xmath29 some of the components are now correlated .",
    "the electric field in the lab frame is @xmath30      without the presence of turbulent rearrangement of the field , flux freezing would govern the behavior of the individual components .",
    "if we assume the presence of turbulent mixing between the different field components , we might expect the field to follow a modified evolution according to @xmath31 where the subscript ff denotes the value the derivative would take under flux freezing , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are arbitrary mixing coefficients .",
    "based on this picture we therefore choose the following convenient _ ad - hoc _ parametrization of the field evolution with lorentz factor @xmath2 and jet radius @xmath3 , including rearrangement : @xmath34 this is the magnetic equation of state we use . in the case of pure flux freezing , @xmath35 for all @xmath36 . in the case of a completely isotropic field",
    "we have @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "note that this prescription is still fully general [ until we make some limiting assumptions about the @xmath41 .",
    "since the re - arrangement process mixes the perpendicular and parallel components of the field , we would expect that the field behavior is changed from flux freezing in such a way that the coefficients @xmath42 are bracketed by the values they take in the case of flux freezing . since the case of a purely isotropic field must be included in our analysis ,",
    "it is clear that this condition requires that @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we define two quantities to characterize the anisotropy of the magnetic pressure : @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the magnetic field is purely perpendicular for @xmath47 , and purely parallel for @xmath48 .",
    "the perpendicular component is purely radial for @xmath49 and purely toroidal for @xmath50 .",
    "the field is perfectly isotropic for @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "it is obvious from equation ( [ eq : magstate ] ) that @xmath53 is constant for any combination of parameters , since @xmath54 by assumption .",
    "while this parametrization alone is rather unrestrictive , we can limit it to a one parameter family by assuming that the @xmath42 are constants under _ any possible _ variation of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and that the rearrangement process does not change the total comoving energy density in the magnetic field .",
    "( otherwise the same process would have to act as an energy sink , since we assume that the magnetic field is the dominant term in the internal energy budget .",
    "we would therefore be dealing with a dissipative process , which we will address in  [ sec : dissipation ] . )",
    "we can solve for @xmath42 in terms of @xmath55 by fixing either @xmath2 or @xmath3 and demanding that the total energy density @xmath56 behave the same as it would following flux freezing : @xmath57 \\nonumber \\\\ & & +      { u'}_{\\parallel } \\left[\\mu_{\\rm 3 } d(\\gamma v ) + \\left(\\mu_{\\rm 4 } -      4\\right ) dr \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = & - 2{u'}_{\\perp}\\left(d(\\gamma v )      + dr\\right ) - 4 { u'}_{\\parallel } dr    \\label{eq : mixingcondition}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for arbitrary @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "constancy of any of the @xmath60 then implies constancy of @xmath55 and substitution of @xmath55 from equation ( [ eq : anisotropies ] ) yields @xmath61 which includes the isotropic case , where the magnetic field behaves like a relativistic gas , for which @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "it turns out that one can find special analytic solutions with constant @xmath42 that satisfy equation ( [ eq : mixingcondition ] ) without the requirement that @xmath55 be constant ( see   [ sec : selfsimilar ] ) . for these solutions the rearrangement process conserves the comoving magnetic energy density _",
    "only _ under the variations in @xmath2 and @xmath3 allowed by the bernoulli equation [ i.e. , @xmath64 and @xmath59 in equation ( [ eq : mixingcondition ] ) are not arbitrary ] .",
    "the only condition on the parameters @xmath42 for such a solution is that @xmath65 .",
    "these solutions are limited to the self - similar range , where the jet is dominated by magnetic pressure . once they approach the terminal phase ( i.e. , @xmath66 ) , the parameters @xmath42 must vary with @xmath17 . for the rest of the paper we will assume that equation ( [ eq : mixing ] ) holds unless indicated otherwise .",
    "it is unlikely that the tangled magnetic field evolves without any dissipation of its energy ( e.g. , via reconnection ) .",
    "we thus include a simple , _ ad hoc _ prescription of magnetic energy losses .",
    "we base our parametrization on the idea that the magnetic field is always in a nearly force - free equilibrium .",
    "however , it is impossible to maintain perfect force - free conditions everywhere and as the jet expands in either direction , the field responds by rearrangement between the different components ( eq .  [ [ eq : mixing ] ] ) and by dissipation of some of its energy .",
    "we therefore assume that the dissipation rate is roughly proportional to the divergence of the velocity in the comoving frame : @xmath67 or , in the lab frame @xmath68 this _ ansatz _ can easily be generalized to different @xmath69 for different field components ( e.g. , if the alfvn velocity factors into @xmath70 ) . for a more realistic dissipation model see the appendix .",
    "we will assume that the dissipated energy goes into isotropic particle pressure , which is then either ( a ) radiated away immediately as _ isotropic _ radiation in the comoving frame or ( b ) accumulated until the jet reaches a state of equipartition between particle pressure and magnetic field .",
    "we write the relativistic continuity equation as @xmath71    the energy and momentum equations are given by @xmath72 , ( @xmath73 is the stress - energy tensor , separable into a matter and an electromagnetic part ) . in the absence of gravity , this reduces to @xmath74 , which will be sufficient for the analysis through most of this paper since most of the acceleration will likely take place at distance @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the mass of the central black hole .",
    "it turns out , however , that gravity _ is _ important in discussing the critical points of the jet , in which case we approximate the covariant derivative by a newtonian potential ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "we will comment on the accuracy of this approximation in  [ sec : sonicpoints ] .    since there is no energy exchange between the jet and the environment , and using the expression for the electromagnetic field measured in the lab frame from  [ sec : magnetic ] , we can write the energy equation as @xmath78 ( neglecting gravity ) .",
    "we integrate the equation over a cross - sectional volume of the jet and convert it to a surface integral using gauss s law . the contribution from",
    "the sidewall is zero , giving @xmath79 ( where the @xmath80 are now averaged quantities ) .",
    "dividing equation ( [ eq : continuity ] ) into equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) gives the relativistic bernoulli equation .",
    "in the more general case including radiative losses and gravity we have @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the energy lost to radiation leaving the jet . we have to make some assumption about the form of @xmath82 , i.e. , the amount of energy radiated away [ cases ( a ) and ( b ) from  [ sec : dissipation ] ] .",
    "the @xmath17-momentum flux @xmath11 can be calculated in much the same way ( integrating @xmath83 across a jet cross - section ) .",
    "since the jet can exchange @xmath17-momentum with the environment , the momentum discharge need not be conserved , however .",
    "dropping terms of order @xmath84 , the integration yields @xmath85.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the sideways momentum equation is given by @xmath86 .",
    "the condition that the solution be stationary ( i.e. , @xmath87 ) gives the pressure balance condition between the jet and its environment .",
    "we assume that the internal structure of the field adjusts to maintain the given cross - section . since we _ assume _ that @xmath88 , the internal variation will be sufficiently small , @xmath89 , to justify the assumption of uniformity ( note : this assumption is only satisfied if the jet is in causal contact ) .",
    "we are thus only interested in the pressure balance condition at the jet walls , @xmath90 , which gives @xmath91 note that @xmath92 directly at the jet boundaries , since the magnetic field is assumed not to penetrate the contact discontinuity . however , since interior pressure balance demands that @xmath93 be constant , we can set @xmath94 and substitute it for @xmath95 at @xmath90 , which gives equation ( [ eq : pressure ] ) .",
    "before we start analyzing the equations presented above , it is worth noting that in the case of a cold ( @xmath96 ) jet and a magnetic field following pure flux freezing ( @xmath97 ) the only possible solution to equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) far away from the core ( i.e. , @xmath98 ) is @xmath99 , i.e. , the jet expands sideways to satisfy pressure balance , without accelerating .",
    "this is because both the kinetic energy flux and the poynting flux do not vary with @xmath3 , while they do vary with @xmath100 , so that equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) becomes an equation of @xmath2 only .",
    "thus , fixing the total jet power @xmath101 fixes @xmath2 . while a scenario like this might explain the coasting phase of the jet ( where no more acceleration occurs ) , it can not account for the initial bulk acceleration we are looking for .",
    "note that this is different than the case of anisotropic , relativistic particle pressure _ in the absence of isotropization _",
    "( i.e. , simply under adiabatic behavior of the individual components ) . in that case , the components scale like @xmath102 , @xmath103 . we might expect a behavior like this for a relativistic turbulent pressure term .",
    "the sideways pressure is simply @xmath104 . at relativistic speeds ,",
    "the solution approaches the one found by br74 , @xmath105 .",
    "thus , unlike in the magnetic case described in this paper , it is generally possible to accelerate a jet with anisotropic particle pressure without making any arbitrary assumptions about the randomization process .",
    "this is simply because _ only _ the perpendicular component of the field , @xmath106 , contributes to the poynting flux , while all components of the pressure enter equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) , which introduces a dependence on @xmath3 , making a solution @xmath107 possible . for a magnetically dominated solution to exist , on the other hand",
    ", we need a field rearrangement process at work , such as was described in  [ sec : mixing ] . but even under such favorable conditions , a proper , accelerating solution is not always guaranteed .",
    "since the jet will likely be injected with sub - relativistic speed , the question arises as to where the jet crosses possible critical points and at what velocity .",
    "if the jet is injected at large distances from the central black hole , we can neglect gravity ; if it is injected close to the hole we will have to include at least a phenomenological gravity term .",
    "as a first step , we will set @xmath108 artificially ( still assuming the presence of an external pressure gradient ) and neglect dissipation ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : energylosses ] ) gives @xmath110\\frac{dv}{vdz } \\nonumber \\\\      & + &   \\left\\{4\\left(2 - \\gamma_{\\rm ad}\\right)p ' - 2\\left(1 +        \\zeta\\right){u'}_{\\perp}\\right\\}\\frac{dr}{rdz } = 0 ,    \\label{eq : soundequation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath111 is the adiabatic index of the particles , @xmath112 .",
    "this equation has a critical point when the expression in square brackets vanishes .",
    "at such a point , the jet cross - section must satisfy @xmath113 , i.e. , the jet must go through a nozzle , the position and cross section of which are determined by the dynamics of the flow . following the notation of br74 ,",

    "we expect @xmath128 , so solutions always accelerate ( decelerate ) for @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) .",

    ". thus , at sufficiently large distances from the core for gravity to be negligible ( see  [ sec : gravity ] ) , highly anisotropic solutions with @xmath139 have to be injected at relativistic velocities to be accelerating , since @xmath140 as @xmath141 .",

    "constant pumping of magnetic energy into particle pressure can lead to equipartition between @xmath245 and @xmath147 .",
    "we can use the self - similar solution to estimate @xmath246 , where the accumulated particle pressure surpasses the magnetic energy density ( including effects of adiabatic cooling on the accumulated particle pressure , where we assume that it behaves as a relativistic gas , which gives an upper limit on the resulting pressure ) .",

    "we define the energy distribution function as @xmath249 where @xmath0 is the lorentz factor according to a particle s random motion , measured in the comoving frame , and @xmath250 are the lower and upper spectral cutoffs . since we assume that the magnetic field is dominating the internal energy budget , synchrotron losses can be very strong , provided the particle energy spectrum is flat enough so that most of the energy is at high particle energies ( i.e. , @xmath251 ) . in that case we can expect most of the energy to be radiated away immediately and the corresponding electrons will lose most of the inertia , thus the dissipated energy will not lead to a build - up of particle pressure . if , however , synchrotron losses are weak compared to dissipation ( e.g. , if the spectrum is too steep , or if synchrotron self - absorption traps most of the radiation to inhibit cooling ) , the effects of particle pressure can become important , as demonstrated in fig .

    "this simple solution is no longer possible in the presence of dissipation , which introduces a sink term into equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) . as a result",
    ", we have to use equation ( [ eq : energylosses ] ) instead .",
    "once the energy has been converted into particle pressure , it can be radiated away as isotropic radiation , which will not affect the dynamics of the jet any further ( assuming that @xmath147 is dynamically unimportant ) .",

    "the presence of ultra - high - energy particles in agn jets suggests that inverse compton ( ic ) enhanced radiation drag might be dynamically important . while odell ( 1981 ) initially suggested that pair jets might be accelerated by the compton rocket effect , phinney ( 1982 ) showed that it is hard to accelerate a plasma beyond fairly modest lorentz factors by radiation pressure without a continuous source of particle acceleration to offset the strong ic cooling of the plasma .",
    "furthermore , if the radiation source is not point - like , the terminal lorentz factor is limited by the solid angle @xmath254 the radiation source subtends . on the other hand , radiation drag can _ hamper _ the bulk acceleration of plasmas containing relativistic particles in the presence of a radiation field , if those particles are continuously reheated to overcome the ic losses .",
    "the dissipation mechanism discussed above could provide such reheating . here",

    "we assume that the ic cooling and the dissipational heating time scales are short compared to the adiabatic timescale .",
    "if this is not satisfied , the influence of radiation drag will be _",
    "reduced_. we can then expect dissipational heating to nearly balance ic losses in a near equilibrium situation .",
    "thus the amount of ic drag is controlled by how much dissipation there is . for this approximation to be valid",

    "finally , we assume that @xmath256 , where @xmath0 is the particle lorentz factor in the comoving frame .",
    "this sets an upper limit of @xmath257\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the comoving radiation energy density ( otherwise ic cooling would have lowered the upper spectral cutoff to @xmath258 ) .",
    "these assumptions allow us to eliminate @xmath259 from the equations , since the drag term and the cooling term are both proportional to @xmath259 . in a sense , then , we are presenting an upper limit on the importance of ic radiation drag over large length scales .",
    "it has to be kept in mind , though , that drag can be much more important in non - stationary situations ( like , for example , in shocks ) , which are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we assume the jet is moving through a radiation field that is locally isotropic in the lab frame .",
    "following phinney s treatment ( 1982 ) , we can calculate the loss rate and the force density due to ic scattering in the comoving frame and then transform back to lab frame to find the additional term for equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) .",
    "we find that radiation drag always decreases _ both _ the acceleration efficiency @xmath225 and the terminal lorentz factor @xmath10 by moderate amounts .",
    "it does not , however , introduce qualitatively new features . to demonstrate this , we have plotted a solution including radiation drag for otherwise identical parameters in fig .",
    "[ fig : gammaplot ] .",
    "in the following section we will investigate the observational effects of the jets we have introduced in this paper .",
    "a highly dissipative jet will radiate away a large fraction of its internal energy along the way before reaching the terminal lorentz factor @xmath10 , while a non - dissipative jet will convert all its internal energy into kinetic energy flux .",
    "since the jet will ultimately terminate and reconvert its kinetic energy flux into random particle energy when it slams into the surrounding medium , the ratio of kinetic luminosity ( which could be estimated based on the energy input into the lobes , based on the source size and its age ) to the radiative luminosity @xmath260 ( i.e. , the integrated luminosity of the jet before reaching the terminal shock ) should give us some indication of the importance of dissipation .",
    "we have already seen in   [ sec : solutions ] that the presence of dissipation can lower @xmath10 , thus lowering the kinetic energy flux at the terminal shock , @xmath189 ( dominated by cold kinetic energy flux ) , and the produced hot - spot luminosity .",
    "a given fraction @xmath261 of the terminal luminosity @xmath262 will be radiated away , which can be estimated from the hot - spot and cocoon luminosity ( calculating @xmath261 is , of course , a highly non - trivial matter ) , giving us a handle on @xmath70 .",
    "we have plotted the ratio @xmath263 in fig .",
    "[ fig : terminalgamma ] . to make that plot , we chose parameters such that in the absence of dissipation the jet would reach @xmath264 .",
    "if we had chosen a larger ( smaller ) value of this parameter , the lines in the plot would move down ( up ) , since @xmath10 depends non - linearly on both @xmath70 and @xmath265 , so this plot is only a representative one of a family of similar plots for different @xmath266 .",
    "another question is what the spatial distribution of the jet emission is , since there are several competing effects : the optical depth to self absorption ( and inverse compton up - scattering ) , doppler boosting and opening angle ( the larger of which will determine the opening angle of the cone into which most of the radiation goes ) , and of course the dissipative power of the jet itself [ depending on @xmath70 and @xmath267 , @xmath268 .",
    "this question can be asked with respect to the _ frequency integrated brightness _",
    "@xmath269 or the _ spectral brightness _ @xmath270 .",
    "if we assume that all the dissipated energy is radiated away on the spot , we can calculate the local dissipation rate , which must then be equal to the local frequency integrated jet emissivity @xmath271 in the comoving frame .",
    "this assumption depends on the injected particle energy spectrum .",
    "if the spectrum is flatter than @xmath272 , most of the energy is in the high energy particles . in that case , synchrotron cooling can be efficient enough for our assumption of on the spot radiation to be effective .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath273 , most of the energy is in the low energy particles , synchrotron radiation will not be efficient ( unless @xmath274 is very high , in which case the injected spectrum would rapidly cool to a quasi mono - energetic distribution ) , and the jet will accumulate particle pressure or radiate by other means ( note that compton cooling would be equally insufficient to balance heating in this case ) .    to investigate the first case we will set @xmath251 . given a viewing angle we can then determine the observed total intensity @xmath269 , given by @xmath275 where @xmath276 is the angle between line of sight and jet axis and @xmath277^{-1}$ ] is the doppler factor .",
    "this expression takes relativistic beaming and the relativistic corrections to foreshortening into account .",
    "one might expect that the integrated brightness peaks at a certain distance from the core , since @xmath278 is strongly peaked at @xmath279 .",
    "however , in our prescription the dissipation drops off too fast for this effect to be important .",
    "the main difference in the brightness evolution is that a dissipative jet has a different efficiency @xmath225 and generally expands less rapidly in the sideways direction ( and will reach a smaller terminal lorentz factor @xmath10 ) .",
    "this effect will become important once the jet has reached @xmath10 and only for @xmath70 large enough to significantly alter the dynamics ( @xmath280 ) .",
    "we have plotted @xmath269 as a function of @xmath17 for different values of @xmath70 , @xmath281 , @xmath282 , and a viewing angle of @xmath283 in fig .",
    "[ fig : intensity ] , arbitrarily normalized to @xmath284 to increase dynamic range ( the brightness decreases by many orders of magnitude along the jet ) .",
    "as is obvious from the plot , for small @xmath70 , only the overall normalization of @xmath269 varies with @xmath70 , whereas for large enough @xmath70 , the brightness distribution itself changes shape due to the altered dynamics . also shown are the doppler factors @xmath278 for the different parameters , which are primarily responsible for the different shapes .",
    "the situation can become more difficult in the opposite case , i.e. , if most of the radiation is trapped ( e.g. , by synchrotron self - absorption , which implies a steep spectrum , @xmath285 ) or if the deposited energy is simply not efficiently radiated ( e.g. , if @xmath286 ) . in that case the emission of dissipated energy could be delayed , leading to a relative brightness peak downstream . to briefly investigate this possibility , we assume the latter case , i.e. , @xmath286 , which is not an unreasonable choice for agns ( see  [ sec : applications ] , for example ) .",
    "we assume that the energy flux @xmath287 peaks at high energies @xmath288 : either at the spectral break of @xmath289 expected in a scenario in which high energy particles are constantly re - injected , where the spectral index @xmath290 is given by @xmath291 or at the spectral cutoff produced by synchrotron and ic cooling ( in the absence of a strong break ) .",
    "the position of @xmath288 depends on adiabatic effects , radiative cooling , and heating due to dissipation .",
    "the spectrum will be self - absorbed at low frequencies , which generally leads to an observed spectral index of @xmath292 ( for an exact treatment of the spectral shape at the self absorption turnover see de kool , begelman , & sikora 1989 ) .",
    "if we take @xmath286 or @xmath293 , the self absorbed part contributes a negligible fraction to the total brightness and most of the energy is emitted at the high end of the spectrum .    in this case",
    "it is impossible to calculate the brightness analytically as a function only of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath17 .",
    "rather , one can numerically integrate the evolution equation of the peak frequency under adiabatic cooling , dissipative heating [ we assume a self - similar transfer of energy from magnetic field to the particles such that @xmath294 , and synchrotron cooling on the basis of the solution @xmath267 given above",
    ". we can estimate the run of @xmath269 by scaling it with the brightness at @xmath288 , taking account of relativistic beaming and aberration .",
    "if we choose to normalize the intensity curves as we did in the previous case , we can get around fixing the absolute normalization of @xmath295 , since it only enters linearly into the intensity and will thus cancel out upon normalization .",
    "we used @xmath296 , along with @xmath297 and plotted the frequency integrated intensity in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonradinten ] with otherwise the same parameter values as in fig .",
    "[ fig : intensity ] , once again normalized to @xmath269 for @xmath298 .",
    "note that for large values of @xmath70 our assumption that the jet be magnetically dominated and that particle pressure be negligible can break down ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gammaeq ] ) , so curves with high @xmath70 are to be taken with a grain of salt . nevertheless , it is interesting to note that the intensity drops less rapidly with @xmath17 for larger values of @xmath70 , corresponding to the delayed emission mentioned above .",
    "the shapes of these curves depend only weakly on @xmath299 .",
    "the different bends in the curves stem from the evolution of the doppler factor ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : intensity ] ) , and the evolution of the peak frequency .",
    "the slopes of the curves are produced mostly by the evolution of the lower cutoff frequency @xmath274 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : spectrum ] ] ) , which enters the expression for the synchrotron brightness through the powerlaw normalization of the particle distribution , and by the evolution of lorentz factor and jet radius ( entering through the particle density and the integration of the emissivity across the jet ) .",
    "while the degree of polarization is highest for homogeneous magnetic fields , jets with tangled or disorganized field can exhibit a net polarization if there is a net anisotropy in the field ( laing 1980 ) .",
    "the measured polarization will depend not only on @xmath55 , but also on the viewing angle @xmath276 and the bulk lorentz factor @xmath2 .",
    "the polarization of radiation from a powerlaw distribution of electrons with index @xmath299 in a region of homogeneous field is given by @xmath300 where @xmath269 is the intensity at a given optically thin wavelength .",
    "to calculate the integrated polarization , we average across the jet . to do this we decompose the radiation into polarization along the jet axis and perpendicular to it .",
    "furthermore , we assume that field directions are distributed among all solid angles and introduce a weighting function that distributes the field orientations to the required anisotropy , @xmath301 where @xmath302 is the angle between the field and the @xmath17-axis and @xmath303 is determined by the anisotropy",
    ". we can solve for @xmath303 under the condition that @xmath304 : @xmath305 we correct the viewing angle for relativistic aberration , which has a significant impact on the observed polarization , since the average polarization will go to zero for a jet seen head on .",
    "furthermore , the angle between line of sight and magnetic field is important in determining the relative brightness of a region .",
    "figure [ fig : polarization ] shows the predicted polarization for the cases shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gammaplot ] , a spectral index of @xmath306 , and a viewing angle of @xmath283 .",
    "since the anisotropy of the jet is fixed , the variation in the polarization @xmath307 is solely caused by changes in the viewing angle due to relativistic aberration .",
    "generally , the polarization will be perpendicular to the jet axis if @xmath132 and parallel if @xmath308 . as long as equation ( [ eq : mixing ] ) holds , an extremum in @xmath307 will be present and it should indicate the position where @xmath309 , i.e. , where the viewing angle corrected for aberration is @xmath310 .",
    "note that this polarization is averaged across the jet . in order to compare these predictions to actual measurements a relatively small correction for the emission weighted averaging across the jet at different angles must be made .",
    "the qualitative predictions of this section should be unaffected by that caveat .",

    "if ( as we speculated above ) much of the particle pressure at large distances was indeed produced by dissipation , @xmath70 could be much larger .",
    "the jet probably reaches terminal @xmath331 somewhere between vlbi scales and vla scales , @xmath332 . for @xmath70 small enough to be dynamically unimportant",
    "we can assume that @xmath333 in the self similar regime .",
    "arbitrarily setting @xmath334 gives @xmath335 .",
    "the central pressure @xmath336 is then @xmath337 , which requires an rms magnetic field of @xmath338 for pressure balance ( using @xmath317 ) .",
    "the initial jet width strongly depends on @xmath184 : @xmath339 for an assumed @xmath340 .",
    "the latter value is unrealistic ( and inconsistent with the limits put on the jet width by vlbi observations , junor & biretta 1995 ) , since most of the energy output of the disk into the jet will be provided close to the black hole .",
    "it is therefore most reasonable to assume that @xmath341 and @xmath342 .",
    "the total jet power implied by the numbers given is of order @xmath343 , consistent with the estimate by bicknell & begelman ( 1996 ) .",
    "overall it seems that this model is consistent with the observed properties of m87 to first order if we adopt a pressure gradient following @xmath342 .    the total isotropic energy output of @xmath344 of grb 990123 ( bloom _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 , bloom _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) argues strongly in favor of non - isotropic gamma - ray burst ( grb ) scenarios , so jet models explaining the apparently beamed nature of these sources ( e.g. , m@xmath240sz@xmath345ros & rees 1997 , sari , piran , & halpern 1999 ) enjoy newly enhanced popularity .",
    "one of the standard scenarios for the energy sources of grbs is a massive accretion event ( either a neutron star - neutron star merger or the accretion of a neutron star by a black hole : narayan , paczy@xmath346ski , & piran 1992 ) , which leads to the formation of a disk after tidal disruption of one of the objects .",
    "since neutron stars already display large magnetic fields , one might expect strong shear amplification of this field in the disk , leading to a scenario similar to what we described in  [ sec : model ] .",
    "similarly , the hypernova approach ( paczy@xmath346ski 1998 , woosley 1993 ) can produce a precollimated outflow , which might then evolve into a jet .",
    "application of our model to grbs is , however , not as straightforward as in the case of mature radio galaxies .",
    "this is because grbs are highly time dependent ( corresponding to the adolescent stages of radio galaxies ) : the lifetime of the jet ( roughly of the order of the light travel time of the material ) is shorter than the sound crossing time of the bubble the jet blows into the environment , so a pressure balanced solution as described above ( which will be set up after the jet and the ambient material have equilibrated , i.e. , after the jet has existed for a few sound crossing times ) might not be a good approximation .",
    "the investigation of jet dynamics in the context of grbs and in the framework of tangled fields as introduced above will therefore be the subject of another paper .",
    "here we simply wish to point out the benefits of jet models in general and an approach based on our model in particular :    * acceleration of grb outflows by poynting flux has the advantage that collimation can be provided not only by the external medium , but also by the field geometry itself ( note that for @xmath52 the perpendicular component of the field does not contribute to the sideways pressure , so for @xmath347 the jet can have a large poynting flux yet orders of magnitude smaller sideways pressure than a particle dominated jet would have for the same energy flux ) . * one would not need to invoke shocks to produce emission in this context , since the internal dissipation of magnetic energy would provide a natural source of high energy particles and photons to produce gamma rays ( see thompson 1994 for an example of how internal dissipation can power grbs ) . the short term variability seen in grbs",
    "could then be explained by inhomogeneities ( e.g. , variations in the inhomogeneity of the field ) imprinted on the outflow by variability in the central engine itself , which is expected to have time scales of the same order as the ones observed .",
    "we have presented simple analytic models of jet acceleration .",
    "the jets are accelerated by tangled magnetic fields , with collimation being provided by pressure from an external medium .",
    "this is a new approach , based on begelman ( 1995 ) , as previous models of mhd jet acceleration concentrated mostly on large scale organized fields .",
    "our analytical quasi-1d approach is limited to narrow jets , for which the opening angle is smaller than the beaming angle , coincident with the condition that the jet be in causal contact with its environment .",
    "we introduce an ad - hoc process that redistributes energy between perpendicular and parallel field to facilitate efficient conversion of internal energy to kinetic energy .",
    "without such a process , stationary jet acceleration by disorganized fields is impossible . in the absence of dissipation",
    ", the rate of acceleration achieved under this scenario is the same as in the case of relativistic particle pressure , @xmath9 .",
    "we also find analytic solutions beyond the self - similar region , which enable us to calculate the terminal bulk lorentz factors of such jets . in order for these jets to reach the observed @xmath1 , they initially must be magnetically dominated .",
    "we estimate the impact of dissipation of magnetic energy on the dynamics of the flow by considering a simple , phenomenological prescription of the loss process .",
    "the presence of dissipation lowers the terminal lorentz factor @xmath10 and generally changes the rate at which the jet is accelerated ( the latter effect is noticeable only if the dissipation rate is comparable to the adiabatic expansion rate ) .",
    "we also include the effects of radiation drag in the simplest scenario , which always lowers the efficiency @xmath225 and @xmath10 .",
    "the amount of radiation drag in our model is controlled by the amount of dissipation replenishing the high energy particle pool but seems to be dynamically unimportant .",
    "we calculate the frequency integrated surface brightness for the extreme cases where all or very little of the dissipated energy is radiated away on the spot and find that , while the brightness drops off very rapidly in all considered cases due to the expansion of the jet , values of the dissipation efficiency @xmath348 can have a significant impact on the intensity as a function of @xmath17 . in the marginally non - radiative case",
    "the buildup of particle energy leads to a slower decline in intensity with @xmath17 for larger @xmath70 .",
    "finally , we apply this model to the prototypical radio galaxy m87 and find that it is consistent with the observed properties .",
