    "the milky way is known to be a spiral galaxy , and its structure has been intensively studied for many decades ( e.g. , oort , kerr & westerhout 1958 ; dame  1987 , 2001 ) . however , there is still little agreement on the detailed spiral pattern , including the number of the spiral arms ( e.g. , cohen  1980 ; drimmel 2000 ; russeil 2003 ; benjamin  2005 ; dame & thaddeus 2008 ; hou  2009 ) .",
    "spiral arms are regions of active star formation and traced primarily by h regions , where young stellar populations ( hot ob stars ) ionize surrounding gas .",
    "the major difficulty in revealing the precise spiral structure of the galaxy arises from the lack of accurate distances to the h regions .",
    "optical distance measurements such as can be obtained from photometric studies are limited in the galactic disk by the large opacity due to dust .",
    "instead , the most widely used method to map the galaxy is to adopt kinematic distances , which are derived by matching the observed radial velocities ( obtained from the doppler shift in observed frequencies ) with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) with line - of - sight velocities expected from a galactic rotation model ( e.g. , schmidt 1965 ; brand & blitz 1993 ) . the famous work done by georgelin & georgelin ( 1976 ) adopts this method ( with the help of optical observations where available ) to map h regions in the galaxy .",
    "however , significant unmodelled deviations from circular motions can cause large distance errors ( burton & bania 1974 ) .",
    "accurate and direct distance measurements without any assumption on the galactic rotation are thus of the greatest importance to delineate the true galactic structure .",

    "in addition to precise distances and absolute sky positions that locate the source in 3 dimensions in the galaxy , measurements of absolute proper motions yield the full 3-dimensional space motions ( i.e. , secular proper motions and source distances together give tangential velocities ) , which enables one to obtain full source information for galactic structure and dynamics .",
    "reid  ( 2009b ) recently refined our knowledge of the galactic spiral structure and kinematics by integrating early results from vlbi astrometry of the galaxy for total 18 high - mass star - forming regions ( hmsfrs ) with methanol , h@xmath1o , sio maser and continuum emission , carried out with the nrao very long baseline array ( vlba ) and with the japanese vera project .",

    "the brightest h@xmath1o maser channel was at @xmath50  km  s@xmath37 ( feature  7 in table  3 ) , and the visibilities of all maser channels were firstly phase - referenced to this channel by fringe fitting ( aips task fring ) using the channel and by applying the phase solutions to all the maser channels . in order to find the maser spot distribution , we imaged all channels with the aips task imagr with a wide field of view of @xmath51@xmath52 around the reference maser spot ( feature  7 ) , with 2048 pixels @xmath9 2048 pixels of size 1 mas .",

    "was used for correlation , we first imaged the phase - referenced maser data to find the positional offset of each maser  feature ( i.e. , a group of maser spots in the same position over adjacent velocity channels ) from the reference center , and then recalculated and corrected the delays for the obtained absolute positions of the maser features until the features came at the map center within 10  mas . after correcting the absolute position of the reference center for each maser feature , we used the same map center at all epochs for the same maser feature .",
    "we imaged the detected maser spots with the aips task imagr for a field of view 25.6  mas @xmath9 25.6  mas around each map center , with 512 pixels @xmath9 512 pixels of size 0.05  mas .",
    "maser positions were fitted with elliptical gaussian distributions with the task jmfit .",
    "rms noise levels in each image per channel were typically 200@xmath0600 mjy / beam .",
    "we performed least - squares fitting to simultaneously solve for the sinusoidal parallax curve and linear proper motion in right ascension ( ra ) for maser spots at consecutive velocity channels for two features that were persistent over more than a year .",
    "we did not solve for the parallax in declination because positional errors due to tropospheric zenith delay residuals were larger in declination as in other measurements ( e.g. , sato  2007 , 2008 ) and also because angular resolution was lower in declination than in ra for g14.33@xmath00.64 ( see table  1 for beam size ) , and the parallax ellipse was smaller in declination .",
    "instead , we removed the parallax obtained from ra fits to fit linear proper motion in declination .    since image distortion and positional errors due to tropospheric zenith delay residuals are severe for sources at low elevation angles associated with low source declinations including g14.33@xmath00.64 ( e.g. , honma  2008b ) , we attempted 4 different elevation cutoff values @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , below which we flagged the data with the aips task uvflg . for cutoffs above @xmath57 , imaging became difficult with high sidelobes due to insufficient data .",
    "we adopted an elevation cutoff of @xmath56 to obtain the best fitting result .",
    "for example , a typical error in the position measurement with one maser spot reduced from 0.18 mas to 0.14 mas by changing the elevation cutoff from @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "flagging low - elevation data changed the beam size of antennas to be elongated in declination , however the beam size in ra was kept almost unchanged or slightly better ( smaller ) ( see table  1 ) .",

    "thermal errors are @xmath83  mas ( i.e. , beam size @xmath4  mas , signal @xmath84  jy / beam , and noise @xmath410.1jy / beam ) and agree well with errors in the relative proper motions as listed in table  3 , which were estimated from standard deviations from the post - fit residual from the least - squares fits ( see @xmath85 and @xmath86 )",
    ".    however , for parallax and proper - motion measurements in the dual - beam data , errors in the measurements are larger than expected from thermal errors of @xmath87  mas ( i.e. , beam size @xmath4  mas , signal @xmath88  jy / beam , and noise @xmath89  jy / beam ) .",
    "the standard deviations from the fits were @xmath90  mas and thus are larger than thermal noise errors .",
    "here we do not consider the reference quasar as predominant error source since it did not show any resolved structure .",
    "also , even though the accuracy of the maser absolute position is limited by the uncertainties of the reference quasar position , the positional error of the reference quasar only adds as a constant offset to the maser spot position at each epoch and do not contribute to uncertainties in parallax and proper - motion measurements .",
    "one of the likely sources that would cause large errors in the parallax and proper - motion measurements is errors in modeling of tropospheric zenith delay ( see sato  2008 and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , the fact that a high elevation cutoff of @xmath56 yielded the best - fit result for the parallax fitting for g14.33@xmath00.34 indicates that this low - declination source is subject to tropospheric delay errors .",
    "however , if errors in modeling of tropospheric zenith delay are the predominant error source , then all maser features at the same epoch should show systematic errors in the position measurements . as can be seen in figure 2 , the deviations from the parallax fits clearly differs for the two different maser features at each eposh ( features 1 and 4 ) , which indicate that errors are random for different features at the same epoch .",
    "therefore , it is likely that errors in modeling of tropospheric zenith delay are not the predominant error source in the remaining data after having removed as much effects of the tropospheric delay errors as possible by adopting a high elevation cutoff .",
    "another likely error source in the parallax measurements is variation in maser structure . in figure 2",
    ", the tendency of deviations from the parallax fits is similar for maser spots in the same feature but different between different features ( features 1 and 4 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the variation of maser structure causes positional errors that are uncorrelated for different features but might be correlated between maser spots in adjacent velocity channels within the same feature . in our parallax measurements ,",
    "the variation of maser structure is likely the predominant error source .",
    "we estimated errors of the parallax measurements from the post - fit residuals from the least - squares fitting .",
    "for different spots within the same maser feature ( e.g. , spots 1a , 1b , 1c , and 1d in feature # 1 ) , we allow for the possibility that errors due to variation in maser structure data may be partially correlated . as a conservative approach , we assumed errors of all spots within the same maser feature at the same epoch are 100% correlated ( but random for different features ) .",
    "this means that , even though we used 7 maser spots of 1a , 1b , 1c , 1d , 4a , 4b , 4c for the measurements , we assume only 2 different maser features contribute as 2 independent spots to reduce the errors of the measurements .",
    "we obtained an error of @xmath91  mas .",
    "instead , if we assume errors due to variation in maser structure are random and uncorrelated for all the 7 spots ( 1a@xmath01d and 4a@xmath04c ) , the errors would reduce to @xmath92  mas . in reality , errors of different spots in the same feature are not likely to be 100% correlated but only partially correlated ( if not uncorrelated ) .",
    "therefore , the error estimate of @xmath91  mas in our parallax measurements is the upper limit of the errors , adopted as a conservative approach .",
    "our parallax measurement for g14.33@xmath00.64 reveals the source distance to be @xmath3  kpc , which is less than half of previously derived kinematic distances .",
    "the kinematic distances for g14.33@xmath00.64 are , for example , 2.5  kpc by molinari  ( 1996 ) from the nh@xmath33 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines ; 2.6 kpc both by walsh  ( 1997 ) and valtts  ( 2000 ) from 6.7-ghz and 95-ghz methanol maser lines , respectively ; 3.1  kpc from the h110@xmath93 line and 2.6  kpc from h@xmath1co absorption lines by sewilo  ( 2004 ) .",

    "note that a shift toward the galactic center in the position of the sagittarius arm was introduced by taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) , to correspond better with the kinematic distances of downes  ( 1980 ) .",
    "downes  ( 1980 ) estimated the kinematic distances to galactic h regions from radio observations of h110@xmath93 and h@xmath1co lines using the schmidt ( 1965 ) model , with typical errors of @xmath95 to 2 kpc for galactic longitudes @xmath96 to @xmath97 , which can be more than @xmath4150% errors for the sagittarius arm at lower galactic latitudes .",
    "although g14.33@xmath00.64 was not in the catalog by downes  ( 1980 ) , it was in the catalog by sewilo  ( 2004 ) in h110@xmath93 and h@xmath1co line observations .",
    "it can be clearly seen in figure  5 that the kinematic distance ( shown as the yellow square ) places g14.33@xmath00.64 as well as the interpolated sagittarius arm further toward the galactic center , like other sources in the arm .",
    "however , our direct parallax measurements ( red square in figure  5 ) reveals the location of g14.33@xmath00.64 to be closer to the sun and outward the galaxy , in good agreement with the sagittarius arm originally modeled by georgelin & georgelin ( 1976 ) , without the ",

    "it is most likely that the  bump in the sagittarius spiral arm toward the galactic center suggested in taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) is due to errors of kinematic distances .",
    "a more recent model by cordes & lazio ( 2002 ) , which is built upon the taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) model , also retains the  bump of the sagittarius arm toward the galactic center .",
    "both taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) and cordes & lazio ( 2002 ) give models for the distribution of free electrons in the galaxy , upon which most pulsar distances are determined using the observed dispersion measures ( dm ) , i.e. , the column density of electrons toward the pulsars ( frail & weisberg 1990 ) .",
    "these models are built by numerically fitting predicted and observed dispersion measures for pulsars with known ",
    "independent distance estimates ( taylor & cordes 1993 ) , most of which come from uncertain kinematic distances .",
    "in particular , kinematic distances are more severely affected by errors of the radial velocities for sources at low galactic longitudes than at high longitudes .",
    "for example , for the simplest assumption of circular galactic rotation with a source distance @xmath101 in the solar neighborhood ( @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the distance to the galactic center from the sun ) , the kinematic distance @xmath101 can be approximated by @xmath104 using oort s constant @xmath105 ( see e.g. , karttunen  2007 ) .",
    "errors in the kinematic distances @xmath106 are thus proportional to the errors in the radial velocities divided by @xmath107 : @xmath108 .",
    "therefore the kinematic distances toward the sagittarius arm in the inner galaxy are expected to be particularly uncertain .",
    "taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) acknowledge that pulsar distances derived from previous models generally tend to be overestimated for @xmath109 and underestimated for @xmath110 ( although they claim their own model has no significant dependence of distance errors on @xmath111 ) , which can account for the  bump of the sagittarius arm toward the galactic center at low galactic longitudes .",
    "our results as shown in figure  6 indicate that the previously expected ",
    "bump in the sagittarius arm toward the galactic center is most likely due to errors that arise from kinematic distances .",
    "russeil ( 2003 ) points out that the nearest part of the sagittarius arm is placed at @xmath112  kpc based on kinematic distances ( using the rotation curve of brand & blitz 1993 ) , while a fitted regular logarithmic arm , also based on kinematic distances , passes at @xmath113  kpc , indicating the possibility that the galaxy does not have a regular design . however , our parallax measurements suggest that the nearest part of the sagittarius arm , indeed , lies at @xmath113  kpc .",

    "arm or spur are also shown with precise parallax measurements : g59.7@xmath1240.1 ( xu  2009 ) , cep  a ( moscadelli  2009 ) , orion ( hirota  2007 ; menten  2007 ; kim  2008 ) , g232.6 + 1.0 ( reid  2009a ) , and vy  cma ( choi  2009 ; reid  2009c ) . with the five sources , reid  ( 2009b ) fitted the pitch angle of the local arm to be @xmath125 , which is larger than the pitch angles they fitted for another spiral arm , e.g. , @xmath126 for the perseus spiral arm .    in figure  6b",
    ", we also attempted a straight line fitting ( line c ) to the five local arm sources ( marked by cyan dots ) plus w51  irs2 ( green hexagon ) , which yields a pitch angle of @xmath127 , which is consistent with the pitch angle fitted with only five sources above .",
    "thus the local arm / spur may branch from the sagittarius arm near the position of w51  irs2 , which is often considered to be at the tangent point of the sagittarius arm .",
    "one possible interpretation is that the sagittarius arm bifurcates near the position of w51  irs2 into the local spur ( line c ) at a pitch angle of @xmath128 and into the other arm traced by g14.33@xmath00.64 and g35.20@xmath00.74 ( line b ) at a pitch angle of @xmath129 .",
    "another possibility is that the sagittarius arm is traced by g14.33@xmath00.64 , g35.20@xmath00.74 and g35.20@xmath01.74 ( line b ) and branches from the interior ( scutum - crux ) arm at a large pitch angle of @xmath130 .",
    "however , more sources with precise parallaxes are needed to establish clear spiral arm structure . ongoing and future parallax measurements with vera and with the vlba",
    "are expected to reveal the structure of the sagittarius arm and other spiral arms of the galaxy further in detail .",
    "it is of interest to compare our results for the distance to the sagittarius arm with studies of galactic magnetic field reversals .",
    "the galactic magnetic field has been probed most often by faraday rotation measure ( rm ) observations of linearly polarized emission from both pulsars ( e.g. , noutsos  2008 ) and extragalactic radio sources ( e.g. , brown  2007 ) .",
    "a common conclusion in many pulsar polarization studies is that the magnetic field in the local arm is clockwise while it is counterclockwise in the first quadrant ( @xmath131 ) component of the sagittarius arm , indicating the existence of a magnetic field reversal between the arms .",
    "weisberg  ( 2003 ) found from pulsar polarimetry a null in the magnetic field of a width less than 0.5  kpc extending from near the sun over 7  kpc toward @xmath132 ( figure  4 in weisberg  2003 ) , located midway between the local and sagittarius arms , which is most likely the field reversal region .",
    "weisberg  ( 2003 ) noted a `` 1-kpc wide strip '' of steady magnetic field from the local reversal ( midway between the local and sagittarius arms ) into the sagittarius arm , based on the sagittarius arm model by cordes & lazio ( 2002 ) .",
    "as previously discussed , our parallax measurements demonstrate the sagittarius arm lies at a closer distance of @xmath4  kpc , instead of previously estimated @xmath5  kpc from kinematic distances , and we find that g14.33@xmath00.64 ( this study ) and g35.20@xmath00.74 ( zhang  2009 ) trace out the near side of the sagittarius arm , which lie outside of the  bump delineated in taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) as well as in cordes & lazio ( 2002 ) .",
    "our parallax measurements thus indicate that the strip of steady magnetic field found by weisberg  ( 2003 ) is likely in the sagittarius arm , rather than in an inter - arm region exterior to the arm .",
    "this lends support to the fact that the magnetic field in the sagittarius arm is steadily and dominantly counterclockwise , and is further evidence for the conclusion of weisberg  ( 2003 ) that the field maxima tend to lie along the spiral arms , while the field reversals occur between the arms .",
    "as seen in figures 4c and 4d , the internal motions of the h@xmath1o masers in g14.33@xmath00.64 show a bipolar jet - like motion on the sky , with deviations of @xmath133  mas  yr@xmath37 from the mean , which correspond to a linear velocity of @xmath134  km  s@xmath37 at a distance of 1.12  kpc .",
    "the central radial velocity @xmath36  km  s@xmath37 of the maser emission agrees well with other molecular line velocities , and the deviations up to 10  km  s@xmath37 from the central radial velocity agree with the proper motions .    from the parallax , proper motion , radial velocity and the sky position of the h@xmath1o maser source",
    ", we can now calculate the full three - dimensional position and velocity of the source in the galaxy . by following the methods described in detail by reid  ( 2009b ) to convert from the heliocentric reference frame to a reference frame that rotates with the galaxy , we obtain the peculiar motion of the source with respect to the galactic rotation .",
    "we adopt the mean absolute proper motion ( the reference frame in figure  4d ) of ( @xmath80 , @xmath81)@xmath78(0.95 , @xmath02.50 ) mas  yr@xmath37 as the systemic motion of the source ( before the correction of the solar motion and the galactic rotation ) , with uncertainties of @xmath1352  mas  yr@xmath13610  km  s@xmath37 in each of the eastward ( @xmath66 ) and northward ( @xmath67 ) directions to allow for the possibility that the mean maser motion does not trace the systemic motion .    for the radial velocity",
    ", we adopted @xmath137  km  s@xmath37 . adopting the _ hipparcos _ solar motion values of @xmath138  km  s@xmath37 ( radially toward the galactic center ) , @xmath139 ( in the local direction of galactic rotation ) and @xmath140  km  s@xmath37 ( vertically upwards , i.e. , toward the north galactic pole perpendicularly to the galactic plane ) from dehnen & binney ( 1998 ) with the recent best - fit results for the galactic constants of @xmath141  kpc and @xmath142  km  s@xmath37 by reid  ( 2009b ) , and assuming a flat rotation of the galaxy ( i.e. , rotational velocity @xmath143 at the source location is the same as at the sun , @xmath144 ) the peculiar velocity components of g14.33@xmath00.63",
    "are obtained to be @xmath145  km  s@xmath37 toward the galactic center at the source position , @xmath146  km  s@xmath37 in the local direction of the galactic rotation , and @xmath147  km  s@xmath37 vertically out of the galactic plane toward the north galactic pole .",
    "here the uncertainties of @xmath148  km  s@xmath37 in the derived peculiar motion are directly due to the uncertainties for the proper motion and radial velocity of g14.33@xmath00.64 .",
    "the contribution from uncertainties in the galactic constants @xmath103 and @xmath149 are negligible , because the galactic rotation term is almost canceled out in the differential calculation .",
    "if we adopt the iau standard values of @xmath150  kpc and @xmath151  km  s@xmath37 instead , the resulting peculiar motion becomes @xmath152  km  s@xmath37 , @xmath146  km  s@xmath37 , and @xmath147  km  s@xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the peculiar motion of g14.33@xmath00.64 is not significant in the direction of galactic rotation ( @xmath153 ) or in the direction out of the galactic plane ( @xmath154 ) . for the source location of g14.33@xmath00.64 relative to the sun in the galaxy ,",
    "the larger peculiar velocity component of g14.33@xmath00.64 toward the galactic center ( @xmath155 ) reflects a radial velocity larger than expected from the circular rotation model , which has led to the larger kinematic distances derived in the previous studies .",
    "overall , g14.33@xmath00.64 shows no significant peculiar motion and is consistent with the circular galactic rotation model .",
    "we are deeply grateful to an anonymous referee for his / her careful reading of the paper and for a number of invaluable suggestions .",
    "we would like to express our sincere gratitude to all staff members and students at vera and kagoshima university for their continuous support .",
