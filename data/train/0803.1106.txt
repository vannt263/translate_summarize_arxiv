    "the scalar field models of de such as quintessence @xcite and k - essence @xcite predict a wide variety of variations in @xmath6 , but still the current observational data are not sufficient to rule out such models unless the equation of state shows a peculiar evolution .",

    "the simplest models that belong to this class are those that are based on the so called @xmath1 gravity theories in which the lagrangian density @xmath9 is a function of the ricci scalar @xmath10 .",

    "<S> we construct a family of viable scalar - tensor models of dark energy ( de ) which possess a phase of late - time acceleration preceded by a standard matter era , while at the same time satisfying the local gravity constraints ( lgc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling @xmath0 between the scalar field and the non - relativistic matter in the einstein frame is assumed to be constant in our scenario , which is a generalization of @xmath1 gravity theories corresponding to the coupling @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these models can be made compatible with local gravity constraints even when @xmath3 is of the order of unity through a chameleon mechanism , if the scalar - field potential is chosen to have a sufficiently large mass in the high - curvature regions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these models generally lead to the divergence of the equation of state of de , which occur at smaller redshifts as the deviation from the @xmath4cdm model become more significant . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the evolution of matter density perturbations and employ them to place bounds on the coupling @xmath3 as well as model parameters of the field potential from observations of the matter power spectrum and the cmb anisotropies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , as long as @xmath3 is smaller than the order of unity , there exist allowed parameter regions that are consistent with both observational and local gravity constraints . </S>"
