    "surveys with the _ spitzer _ space telescope have been spectacularly successful at identifying infrared excess emission associated with planetary debris disks around a- through k - type stars .",
    "the excesses at 70 @xmath2 m are associated with cool dust located at distances from the stars analogous to the position of the kuiper belt ( kb ) in the solar system ( moro - martn et al .",
    "2008 ) , although much larger numbers of objects must lie in these exo - kuiper belts to account for the detected level of emission ( trilling et al . 2008",
    "; hillenbrand et al . 2008 ; carpenter et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the most sensitive studies find 70 @xmath2 m excesses around @xmath3 15 - 20% of mature solar - type stars over the entire 10 myr to 10 gyr age range ( trilling et al .",
    "the excesses at 24@xmath2 m are generally associated with warmer dust and disappear relatively quickly as the host star ages ; about 30% of the stars of the pleiades age ( @xmath3 120 myr ) show excess emission ( sierchio et al .",
    "2010 ) whereas by the age of praesepe ( @xmath3 600 myr ) , the 24 @xmath2 m excesses have almost completely disappeared ( meyer et al . 2008 ; gspr et al . 2009 ) .",
    "because the expected lifetimes of the debris dust grains are much shorter than the ages of the stars , it is inferred that the dust originates from collisional activity in reservoirs of planetesimals left over from the planet formation process ( hence the term _ debris _ dust ) . to sustain the dust production ,",
    "it is necessary that large planetesimals ( 1000 km - sized ) or unseen planets stir the planetesimals so they continue to collide with each other .",
    "planets are also responsible for constraining the planetesimals in some zones and clearing them from others , thus determining much of the structure of the debris system .",
    "the way the patterns of debris disks activity decay with age is consistent with the expectation that the inner zones of a planetary system have relatively short dynamical time scales , whereas dynamical activity unfolds slowly at the distance of the kuiper belt .",
    "a highlight of the recent surveys is the first detection of debris disks around stars with planets ( beichman et al .",
    "2005 ; moro - martn et al .",
    "these planets orbit within several au of their parent star , whereas the cold dust emitting the observed far - ir radiation generally resides tens of au away .",
    "despite the separation between the dust and planets , it is still possible for the planet to shape the structure of the dust ( and planetesimals ) disk . in the multiple - planet system",
    "hd 38529 , for example , secular resonances excited by planets at 0.13 and 3.7 au create regions at tens of aus that are unstable for orbiting planetesimals ( moro - martn et al . 2007b ) .",
    "several additional systems have been identified as having both multiple planets ( capable of exciting secular resonances ) and orbiting debris ( indicating the presence of planetesimals ; bryden et al .",
    "2009 , su et al .",
    "presumably there are many more stars with debris - disk excesses that also harbor multiple but undiscovered planets .",
    "detailed studies of the known examples can reveal aspects of their behavior that help us understand the diversity of planetary systems . in this paper",
    "we study four of these systems : hd 128311 , hd 202206 , hd 82943 and hr 8799 . in section [ obs ]",
    "we describe the planet and debris dust detections for each one of these systems , and present new @xmath0 @xmath1 detections for the debris disks around hd 202206 and hd 82943 . in section [ sed ]",
    "we use a radiative transfer model to identify the range of parameters ( dust mass and dust location ) that would fit the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . due to the high fractional luminosity ,",
    "the grain - grain collisional time - scale is shorter than the poynting - robertson ( p - r ) time - scale for all these systems and therefore we expect the dust to trace the location of the dust - producing planetesimals . in section [ dyn ] , we use a dynamical model to assess the long - term orbital stability of the putative dust - producing planetesimals , taking into account the effect of secular resonances .",
    "putting together the results from the sed and dynamical analysis , in section [ loc ] we discuss the potential location of the dust - producing planetesimal belts .",
    "including the solar system , 19 planetary systems are currently known to have both orbiting debris and planets ( bryden et al .",
    "2009 ) , and while the majority are single - planet systems , seven of them are known to harbor multiple planets .",
    "these systems are described in figure [ arch ] and table [ multidisks ] .",
    "figure [ arch ] also shows the locations of the planetesimal belts derived either from work in the literature or in this paper .",
    "our estimates arise from sed fitting together with dynamical models that study the effects imposed by the planets on the stability of the planetesimals . in this section",
    "we describe the infrared excesses , the planet detections , and the dynamical models for the planet orbits .    for these multi - planet systems ,",
