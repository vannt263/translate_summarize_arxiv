    "the non - local spin valve ( nlsv ) , also called a lateral spin valve or spin accumulation sensor , plays an essential role in modern spintronics because of the unique ability to separate charge current from pure spin current @xcite .",
    "the nlsv is formed from two ferromagnetic ( fm ) nanowires connected by a non - magnetic ( nm ) channel material with a length @xmath1 on the order of the spin diffusion length . as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ nlsvcartoon]a ) , when a ( charge ) current is driven from the left fm contact and extracted from the nearby end of the nm channel , the spin polarization of the electrons flowing into the channel causes a transfer of angular momentum , or spin , into the nm .",
    "this spin accumulation diffuses , decaying exponentially with distance with a spin diffusion length @xmath2 .",
    "note that in the ideal case no charge current is present in the nm channel where the spin accumulation leads to a pure spin current , @xmath3 . because of the difference in chemical potential for up and down spins , the potential difference @xmath4 measured between the right fm contact and the right side of the nm channel depends on the relative alignment of the magnetization in the two fm contacts .",

    "this electrically - driven nlsv allows powerful probes of spin injection , spin accumulation , and spin transport in a wide variety of material systems @xcite .    despite decades of study , spin transport and injection even in supposedly simple metallic systems still holds open questions and surprising results , including the role of size and material effects and nature of the injection mechanisms @xcite .",
    "these open questions become more urgent as industrial use of nlsv sensors for demanding magnetic field sensing applications such as read heads in magnetic recording rapidly approaches reality @xcite . recently",
    ", thermal effects on the nlsv have proven a critical area of study , with some authors suggesting that the dominant physics driving the background resistance of the nlsv originates in thermoelectric effects @xcite , and others observing that significant joule heating plays an important role in spin injection @xcite .",

    "this thermal generation of pure spin current , usually called the spin - dependent seebeck effect ( sdse)@xcite , is still largely unexplored , and often difficult to quantify due to the need to accurately determine the thermal gradient in nanoscale structures .",
    "there is a great deal of interest in the sdse for applications in sensors and as a source for pure spin currents in possible spin - based logic @xcite , as well as for its role in spin - torque switching in response to fast or ultrafast laser fluence @xcite .        in this paper",
    "we present measurements of thermal and electrical spin injection and transport in all - metallic nlsvs made using permalloy ( py , the ni - fe alloy with @xmath9 ni ) fm and aluminum nm .",
    "in addition to quasi - dc measurements using the equivalent of the lock - in amplifier techniques common in the field , we fully characterize the voltage - current characteristics of the nlsv in both electrical and thermal spin injection configurations . as discussed in detail below , this allows description of each device using a simple analytic thermal model that includes joule heating and peltier heating or cooling .",
    "with knowledge of the thermal conductivity and seebeck coefficients of representative films that we measure using our technology for thin film thermal measurements @xcite , we determine an upper limit on the thermal gradient driving spin injection without recourse to complicated simulations or assumptions of bulk thermal properties . we also use a 2d finite element approach based on purely diffusive heat flow , though again informed by measured values of thermal conductivity and seebeck coefficients , to approach a more realistic estimate of the thermal gradient and the sdse .",
    "the resulting sdse coefficient for the py / al system at @xmath10 k that we report here is smaller in absolute value than previous reports using typical ferromagnets , though very comparable as a fraction of the absolute seebeck coefficient @xcite despite a very low efficiency of electrical injection .",

    "accurately determining the thermal gradient generated in any nanoscale metallic device is a serious challenge . even if complicated 3d finite element analysis ( fem ) is used ,",
    "having accurate values of thermal properties for the thin film constituents of the devices is important , and the role of interfaces for electron , phonon , and spin transport is difficult to quantify without great effort @xcite .",
    "furthermore , typical codes describe only diffusive heat transport , ignoring ballistic or quasi - ballistic phonon transport that is known to play a role in nanoscale metallic features on insulating substrates @xcite . in fact the previously common view that only phonons of quite short wavelength and mean - free - path dominate heat transport in bulk materials at room temperature is now understood to be incorrect , with more and more quantitative measurements showing large contributions to heat flow from parts of the phonon spectrum ignored in typical fem simulations @xcite .",
    "these issues suggest that truly quantitative determination of the sdse coefficient will be challenging and some level of disagreement between experimental groups should be expected , a situation familiar to the spintronics community .",
    "we therefore clarify that the main result of this study requires no complicated or controversial calculations of thermal gradients .",

    "we can also use a simple 1d valet - fert model for spin diffusion to make a more fair comparison of spin accumulation at the injection site between devices and injection techniques .",
    "this suggests that slachter et al.s 100 nm asymmetric nlsv where ion milling was used to remove py oxide at the interfaces showed thermal spin accumulation of @xmath75 % of electrical spin accumulation at the same applied current .",
    "our nlsvs , where py oxide likely remains at the interface , show similar thermal spin accumulation but dramatically smaller electrical spin accumulation so that the ratio is @xmath76 % .",

    "we assume the two fm / nm junctions equilibrate to two different temperatures in steady state , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , that both junctions are connected to thermal ground ( the substrate held at @xmath82 ) via the same thermal conductance @xmath83 , and that heat can flow between the two junctions via thermal conductance @xmath84 .",
    "this model is shown schematically for electrical spin injection in fig .",
    "[ ivs]a ) . note that truly ascribing physical meaning to the parameters in this simple model is difficult .",
    "for example one would normally expect that the nm channel in a typical nlsv would be coupled to the bath ( substrate ) with approximately the same thermal conductance as the junctions , though all these features are on the size scale where decoupling from the phonons responsible for heat - sinking the metal structures can lead to larger heating effects and counterintuitive behavior @xcite .    as already noted by other groups @xcite , when current is driven into the injector fm and out of one arm of the nm channel , joule heating in this current path",
    "is accompanied by either cooling or heating due to the peltier effect . whereas joule heating , @xmath85 , is always positive ,",
    "the peltier term , @xmath86 , is either positive or negative .",
    "the sign of the peltier term depends on the direction of applied current , the geometric arrangement of the two metals with respect to this current flow , and the difference in the absolute peltier coefficients of the two materials ( written here simply as the relative coefficient @xmath87 ) .",

    "this is the critical value needed to calculate the sdse coefficient , @xmath91 .",
    "first we assume that the parameter @xmath84 is given by the thermal conductance of the normal metal nanowire itself ( ignoring any heat transported by the underlying substrate ) and use the wiedemann - franz law to determine this @xmath84 from the measured resistance of the channel , @xmath92 , @xmath93 here we take the value of the lorenz number , @xmath94 from a measurement of a similar al thin film made using our micromachined thermal isolation platform @xcite .",
