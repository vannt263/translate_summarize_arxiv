    "time delays between multiple images of gravitational lenses provide the opportunity to measure the hubble constant h@xmath10 ( refsdal 1964 ) independently of local distance scale methods which rely on uncertain calibrations ( saha et al .",
    "2001 ; freedman et al .",
    "although the method is attractive for its reliance on general relativity alone and being a one - step global measurement , degeneracies inherent to the mass distribution of the lenses seem hard to break without external information ( e.g. koopmans 2001 ) .",
    "we recently showed that a combination of stellar kinematics and gravitational lensing can be used to place tight constraints on the mass distribution of early - type ( e / s0 ) lens galaxies inside their einstein radius ( koopmans & treu 2002 , treu & koopmans 2002 ; kt02 and tk02 ) .",
    "in particular , it was found that the total mass density profiles of the lens galaxies in mg2016 + 112 and 0047281 are very close to @xmath11 .",
    "both lens systems lie on the fundamental plane ( fp ; dressler et al .",
    "1987 ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ) at their respective redshifts , and are part of the sample that we selected for the lenses structure and dynamics ( lsd ) survey , currently being carried out at the keck telescope .",
    "pg1115 + 080 ( @xmath12=0.31 ; weynman et al .",
    "1980 ) is _ not _ part of the lsd survey  which focuses mainly on relatively isolated early - type galaxies  because of the presence of a massive compact group nearby that could affect the mass distribution of the lens galaxy through interaction .",
    "however , this system is particularly interesting because time delays between the lensed quasar images ( @xmath13 ) are available ( schechter et al .  1997 ; barkana 1997 ) , which can be used to measure h@xmath10 .",
    "the geometry of this lens system has been modelled in detail ( schechter et al .",
    "1997 ; keeton & kochanek 1997 ; courbin et al .  1997 ; saha & williams 1997 ; impey et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter i98 ; williams & saha 2000 ; kochanek , keeton & mcleod 2001 ; saha & williams 2001 ; zaho & pronk 2001 ) , illustrating how strongly the value of h@xmath10 depends on the mass profile of the lens galaxy .",
    "whereas @xmath11 mass models yield values of h@xmath10@xmath1450  kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 , steeper or constant m / l mass models can yield values up to 6070 kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 .    in this letter , we apply the methods developed for the lsd survey to the lens e / s0 galaxy in pg1115 + 080 to break the mass - profile degeneracy and perform an accurate measurement of the hubble constant , minimising this dominant source of systematic uncertainty .",
    "based on the lensing and kinematic constraints ( i.e. the published velocity dispersion measurement by tonry 1998 ) , we build a mass model (  2 ) which we then use to determine h@xmath10 (  3 ) .",
    "we summarise and discuss our results in  4 . throughout",
    ", we define @xmath15  kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 , and we assume @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the cosmography affects h@xmath10 only at a few percent level .",
    "hubble space telescope ( hst ) images of the gravitational lens system pg1115 + 080 are available from the hst archive .",
    "we select the images with better resolution and sampling in each of the available bands : @xmath18s exposure with the near infrared camera and multi object spectrograph ( nicmos ; go-7496 ; pi : falco ) camera 2 ( nic2 ) through filter f160w ( i98 ) ; 10 exposures on the planetary camera ( pc ) of the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) through filter f814w for a total exposure time of 15060 s ( hst go-6555 ; pi : schechter ) ; @xmath19s exposures on the wfpc2-pc through filter f555w ( hst g0 - 7495 ; pi : falco )    the images were first reduced using a series of iraf tasks based on the drizzle package ( fruchter & hook 2002 ) .",
    "this process yielded maps of bad pixels , cosmic rays , saturated pixels , and pixels affected by horizontal smearing for each individual exposure .",
    "then , we used a series of idl scripts to subtract the qso multiple images from each individual exposure , after masking the deviant pixels . for each exposure we used a library of subsampled synthetic point spread functions ( psfs ) computed with tiny tim 6.0 ( krist & hook 2001 ) covering a range of the relevant parameters , such as jitter and",
    "focus offset to simulate hst breathing .",
    "the psf giving the smallest residuals was used to remove the qso images from each exposure .",
    "the individual exposures were finally combined to produce an image of the lens galaxy .",
    "the lens galaxy is imaged at high signal to noise ratio in the f160w and f814w images , which we used to measure its structural parameters .",
    "the structural parameters are listed in table  [ tab : photo ] .",
    "an almost complete ring is visible in the f160w image ( see i98 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the signal - to - noise ratio is significantly lower in the f555w exposure and structural parameters could not be reliably measured .",
    "however , the colour f555w ",
    "f814w=@xmath20 can be reliably measured within a fixed aperture of radius @xmath21 .",
    "rest frame quantities were obtained as described in treu et al.(2001b ) using the f814w photometry , the f555w ",
    "f814w colour , and correcting for galactic extinction with e(b  v)=0.041 ( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ) .",
    "we use the parameters in the f814w filter because it is much closer in wavelength than f160w to the standard rest frame b and v bands , and the effects of possible colour gradients are therefore minimised .",
    ".surface photometry of the lens galaxy .",
    "rest frame quantities through filters b and v are computed for @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath17 and e(b  v)=0.041 ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) [ cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     additional constraints can be obtained by using the shape of the einstein ring ( kochanek et al .",
    "2001 ) , as determined by tracing its peak surface brightness in 47 independent points .",
    "we do not use the brightness maxima or minima of the ring , which are difficult to measure accurately .",
    "we assume an error of @xmath24 on the ring peak - brightness positions , chosen to yield a minimum-@xmath25 approximately equal to the number of degrees of freedom for the @xmath0 lens model .",
    "in this way , we find minimum@xmath25 values of 56 , 55 and 55 for models where the lens galaxy is modeled as a single singular isothermal ellipsoid ( i98 ) , a single pseudo - jf ( i.e. constant",
    "m / l ) profile with half - light radius equal to @xmath26 ( i.e. @xmath27 ; see keeton 2001 ) , and our best hq model embedded in a steep dark - matter halo ( see  2.2 ) , respectively ( a singular isothermal group is assumed ) .",
    "remarkably , the @xmath25 values are indistinguishable and the values of h@xmath10 in all three cases are found to be similar to those without the ring as an additional constraint .",
    "we therefore conclude that the einstein ring does not allow us to distinguish between an @xmath0 mass model , a constant m / l pseudo - jf model with break radius @xmath28 , or our best dynamical mass model , nor does it improve significantly the accuracy on h@xmath10 ( see also saha & williams 2001 ) .",
    "finally , we note that all our models give @xmath29 , consistent with barkana ( 1997 ) .    tab .",
    "3 lists the values of h@xmath10 obtained for a variety of mass models ( hq to jf luminous mass profiles , isothermal to nfw group mass profiles , isotropic to non - isotropic stellar mass distributions ) , all consistent with the available observations ( see  2.3 ) .",
    "this relatively large set of models leads to a tight range of h@xmath10=5662  kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 .    to compute the random errors we include the contributions from uncertainty in the images and lens positions , in the time - delay , in the image flux - ratios , in the slope of the dark - matter halo and in the fraction of stellar mass inside the einstein radius .",
    "the errors from the lens model and dynamical model are determined separately , assuming they are independent .",
    "in all cases the errors on h@xmath10 due to the lens models significantly dominate those due to the dynamical models . in particular , the uncertainties on the galaxy position and time - delay dominate the error budget on h@xmath10 .",
    "we combine the random errors from the lensing and dynamical models and list the 68% cl limits in tab .",
    "3 . because we re - optimize @xmath25 until @xmath30 , the error - ranges include the effects of any parameter degeneracies ( i.e. internal versus external shear ) within the context of our mass model .",
    "we adopt , as best estimate of h@xmath10 from pg1115 , the average value from the eight models considered in table  [ tab : dh0 ] , for the random uncertainty the average of the random uncertainties and for the systematic uncertainty the semi - difference between the maximum and minimum values , i.e. h@xmath31",
    "kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7(random / systematic ) .",
    "we have combined mass - to - light ratio constraints with lensing and dynamical analyses  using the stellar velocity dispersion measurement from tonry ( 1998 )  to constrain the radial mass profile of the lens galaxy of pg1115 + 080 and break its degeneracy with the value of h@xmath10 , as determined from the measured time delay .",
    "our main results are :    a steep total mass profile with @xmath32@xmath33@xmath34 , where @xmath35=2.35@xmath360.1@xmath360.05 , and an isotropic or mildly radial velocity ellipsoid , successfully reproduces the stellar velocity dispersion and the lensing constraints .",
    "a two - component mass model , with a luminous component with stellar @xmath37 as determined from the evolution of the fp , satisfies all the constraints only for a relatively steep ( compare tk02 and kt02 ) inner slope of the dark matter halo and a considerable fraction of stellar mass within the einstein radius , @xmath38 .",
    "this model explains the offset of pg1115 + 080 from the fp in terms of structural differences and does not require strong radial anisotropy of the stellar velocity distribution .    in previous work , _ ad hoc _ distributions of stellar orbits",
    "have been constructed inside a logarithmic potential also leading to a high stellar velocity dispersion ( romanowsky & kochanek 1999 ) . however , if the enclosed mass is kept fixed ( given by the lens model ) , these orbits need to be extremely radial and instability issues may arise .",
    "recent numerical analyses show that if e / s0 galaxies are offset from the fp through radial anisotropy by more than the observed scatter in the fp , they become unstable and evolve back to the fp ( nipoti et al .",
    "tangential orbits always lead to a lower central velocity dispersion .",
    "our mass model explains the offset by breaking the homology in the mass distribution , and is consistent with the anisotropy structure expected in galaxy - formation scenarios , with close to isotropic orbits in the central regions ( e.g. van albada 1982 ; see also the observations in gerhard et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "our similar analyses of two other lenses ( mg2016 + 112 and 0047281 ; tk02 and kt02 ) indicate that both lie on the fp of field e / s0 galaxies _ and _ not only have total mass profiles with slope @xmath392 within 5% , but in the case of 0047281 , a spatially resolved velocity dispersion profile allows us to rule out tangential anisotropy or significant radial anisotropy in the center of the galaxy .",
    "data for other lenses with quality comparable to 0047281 are being collected by the lsd survey , to provide more information on the mass distribution and orbital structure of e / s0 ( lens ) galaxies .    applying these dynamical constraints to the lens mass models of pg1115 + 080",
    ", we find h@xmath6  kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 including random ( 68% cl ) and systematic uncertainties .",
    "to achieve higher accuracy it will be necessary to further reduce the dominant sources of uncertainty , i.e. errors on astrometry and time delay .",
    "note that this value is significantly higher than the value of h@xmath40@xmath364  kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7found by i98 , who assumed an @xmath0 mass profile .    comparing to other lensing measurements of h@xmath10 ,",
    "our value is consistent with those derived from b1608 + 656 ( fassnacht et al .",
    "1999 ; koopmans & fassnacht 1999 ; fassnacht et al .",
    "2002 ) and b1600 + 434 ( koopmans et al .",
    "2000 ; kochanek 2002 ) , both assuming @xmath0 mass profiles .",
    "however , in other cases values of h@xmath41kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7  have been found using @xmath0 mass profiles as well ( e.g. kochanek 2002 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the @xmath0 approximation might not always appropriate for the determination of h@xmath10 from time - delays , given the intrinsic scatter in the total mass profile and fraction of dark matter in the central 12r@xmath42 of e / s0 galaxies ( see e.g. , bertin et al.1994 ; carollo et al .  1995 ; gerhard et al .",
    "2001 , for ranges of mass profiles of e / s0 galaxies ) , particularly if there is evidence for offsets from the fp .",
    "we propose that the apparent differences between h@xmath10 , inferred from different lens galaxies modelled with the same mass profiles , is therefore the result of structural , _ not kinematic _ ,",
    "non - homology of e / s0 galaxies , which might be related to differences in their formation or interaction histories ( e.g. field versus group / cluster ) .",
    "hence it appears that additional constraints , such as stellar kinematics , are essential to precisely determine the mass profile  hence h@xmath10  for at least some lens - systems with measured time - delays .    finally , as compared to local determinations of h@xmath10 ,",
    "our value is consistent with h@xmath43 kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7  from saha et al .",
    "( 2001 ; and references therein ) , but only marginally consistent with the final value , h@xmath44  kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 , from the hst key - project ( freedman et al.2001 ) .",
