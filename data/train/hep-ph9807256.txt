    "rare b meson decays , induced by flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) @xmath4 transitions are one of the interesting research area to test the standard model ( sm ) at loop level .",
    "they are informative in the determination of the fundamental parameters , such as cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements , leptonic decay constants , etc . and useful for establishing the physics beyond the sm , such as two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) @xcite , etc .",
    "since the sm predicts the large branching ratio ( @xmath5 ) , which is measurable in the near future , the exclusive decays induced by @xmath6 process become attractive .",
    "such transitions has been investigated extensively in the sm , 2hdm and mssm , in the literature @xcite- @xcite . for these transitions ,",
    "the matrix element contains a term includes the virtual effects of the top quark proportional to @xmath7 and additional terms describing the @xmath8 and @xmath9 loops , proportional to @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively . using the unitarity of ckm matrix , i.e. @xmath12 , and neglecting the factor @xmath11 compared to @xmath13 and @xmath14 , it is easy to see that the matrix element involves only one independent ckm factor , @xmath7 .",
    "this causes that the cp violating effects are suppressed within the sm @xcite .",
    "however , for @xmath15 decay , all the ckm factors @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are at the same order and this leads to a considerable cp violating asymmetry between the channels induced by the inclusive @xmath15 and @xmath19 decays .",
    "these effects have been studied in the literature for the inclusive @xmath0 decay , in the framework of the sm @xcite .",
    "the difficulties of the experimental investigation of the inclusive decays stimulate the study of the exclusive decays . however , the theoretical analysis of the exclusive decays is complicated due to the hadronic form factors which can be calculated using non - perturbative methods .",
    "the dispersion formulation of the light - cone constituent quark model is one of the method which can be used to calculate the hadronic matrix elements . in the literature ,",
    "the form factors for @xmath0 induced exclusive @xmath20 decays have been calculated in the framework of this method @xcite .",
    "the cp violation effects for these exclusive decays have been studied in the framework of the sm @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we present the leading logarithmic ( llog ) qcd corrected effective hamiltonian in the 2hdm with flavor changing neutral currents ( model iii ) for the inclusive @xmath0 decay and calculate the differential @xmath5 of the exclusive @xmath21 process .",
    "further , we study the cp - violation asymmetry ( @xmath22 ) and forward - backward asymmetry ( @xmath23 ) of dileptons for the decay @xmath24 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we give the llog qcd corrected hamiltonian responsible for the inclusive @xmath0 decay and calculate the matrix element . in section 3 , we present the @xmath5 and @xmath22 of the exclusive @xmath25 decay and analyse the dependencies of the @xmath5 and @xmath22 on the couplings @xmath26 , @xmath27 . in section 4 , we study the @xmath5 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the exclusive @xmath24 decay .",
    "section 5 is devoted to our conclusions . in appendix",
    ", we summarize the essential points of the model iii and give the explicit forms of some functions we use in our calculations .",
    "in this section , we present the llog qcd corrections to the inclusive @xmath28 decay amplitude in the 2hdm with tree level neutral currents ( model iii ) .",
    "the llog qcd corrections to the @xmath0 decay amplitude can be calculated using the effective theory . in this method , the heavy degrees of freedom , @xmath29 quark , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 bosons , in the present case , are integrated out . here",

    "<S> we observe that there is a possibility to enhance the branching ratios and suppress the cp violating effects for both decays in the framework of the model iii . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the measurements of these quantities will be an efficient tool to search the new physics beyond the sm . </S>"
