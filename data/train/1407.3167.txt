    "the discovery of a higgs - like boson by the atlas and cms experiments @xcite is considered as a milestone in illuminating the electroweak symmetry ( ew ) breaking mechanism . in case of observing no direct evidence for new physics at the lhc , one important task would be the precise measurement of the higgs boson couplings with the standard model ( sm ) particles .",
    "in other words , the precise measurement in higgs sector will be one of the main objectives of the future experiments if no new particle is found beside the higgs boson . beside the lhc",
    ", it has been shown with detailed realistic simulations that the international linear collider ( ilc ) and the compact linear collider ( clic ) can achieve high precision measurements for the higgs boson properties  @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the ilc  @xcite and clic @xcite programs will be to run at the center - of - mass energies between 200 and 500 gev to provide the opportunity for threshold scans like @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the ultimate goal of the ilc will be increasing the center - of - mass energy to 1 tev while clic aims to reach at the center - of - mass energy of 3 tev .",
    "certainly , the lhc will improve the higgs boson related measurements with more data that will be accumulated at the center - of - mass energies of 13 and 14 tev .",
    "however , it is well known that the precise measurements at the ilc or clic are complementary to the lhc in many aspects @xcite .    as the nature of the space - time may change at planck scale , a possible generalization of the ordinary quantum mechanics and quantum field theory to describe",
    "the physics at planck scale is noncommutativity in space - time .",
    "motivations for construction the models on noncommutative space - time are originating from the string theory , quantum gravity , and lorentz breaking @xcite .    in the simplest way , the noncommutativity can be described by a set of constant c - number parameters @xmath16 or equivalently can be charactrized by an energy scale @xmath1 and dimensionless parameters @xmath17 as the following :    @xmath18 = i\\theta_{\\mu \\nu } = \\frac{i}{\\lambda^{2}}c_{\\mu\\nu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is an antisymmetric tensor with the dimension of @xmath20^{-2}$ ] .",
    "a noncommutative version of the ordinary quantum field theory is obtained only by replacing the ordinary products with the so - called moyal @xmath21 product that is defined as @xcite : @xmath22    as mentioned , one can construct the noncommutative quantum field theory via weyl correspondence in which the ordinary product among the fields is replaced by the moyal @xmath21 product @xcite . to study the noncommutative effects , we concenrtate on the minimal version of the noncommutative sm @xcite . by the means of seiberg - witten maps , one can expand the matter gauge fields in noncommutative space - time in terms of the commutative fields as power series of the noncommutativity parameter @xmath23 @xcite . in the approach of seiberg - witten maps , the gauge fiels @xmath24 and matter fields @xmath25 in the noncommutative space - time",
    "can be expanded in terms of the commutative fields as power series of @xmath23 : @xmath26 in the limit of @xmath27 the noncommutative fields reduce to the fields in the commutative space - time .",
    "one of the interesting advantage of this approach is that it can be applied to any gauge theory with arbitrary representation of matter field .",
    "the minimal noncommutative sm predicts new interactions among the sm particles as well as correcting the ordinary sm vertices .",
    "this leads to interesting signals at the collider experiments .",
    "there are already several phenomenological studies on the effects of noncommutativity on various decay and scattering processes that can be found in @xcite . in most of these studies ,",
    "lower limits on the noncommutative charactristic scale have been set .",
    "one interesting effects of noncommutivity is to change the angular distributions of the final state particles in the scattering processes and in the decay of unstable particles .",
    "it is because of the violation of the angular momentum conservation in the noncommutative theory . as an example , in @xcite it has been shown that the noncommutativity affects the total cross section and the differential cross sections significantly in the @xmath28 processes .",
    "therefore , both the total and differential cross sections can be used to set lower limit on the noncommutative scale @xmath1 .",
    "the same effect is present in @xmath29 production that has been studied in @xcite at the lhc and tevatron .",
    "as mentioned previously in @xcite based on theoretical calculations , it has been found that the azimuthal distribution of the emitted higgs boson in @xmath30 process is sensitive to the noncomutativity .",
    "now , the important task is to perform a more realistic study to obtain the possible limits on the noncommutative scale using this angular distribution and the total cross section at different center - of - mass energies and more importantly at different integrated luminosities of data that will be collected by the future @xmath31 experiments .",
    "this should be done by employing advanced statistical methods that are used currently by the large experiments at the lhc and tevatron .",
    "this will help us to know what would be the outcome of the future experiments at different phases of energy and luminosity .",
    "the goal of this short report is to estimate the lower bound on the noncommutative scale @xmath1 at @xmath32 cl in electron - positron collisions with a z - boson plus a higgs boson in the final state .",
    "we set the limit using a test statistics based on the profile likelihood ratio @xcite on the angular distribution .",
    "we also set limit on @xmath1 by obtaining the upper limit on the total cross section of the signal using a bayesian approach @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the noncommutative cross section of the process @xmath33 is shown .",
    "section 3 is dedicated to use the profile likelihood ratio to extract the @xmath32 cl lower limit on the noncommutative scale . in section 3 , we also obtain the expected upper limit on the signal cross section including @xmath34 and @xmath35 bands .",
    "we show the limit as a function of the integrated luminosity .",
    "in this section we show the dependency of the total cross section of @xmath36 as a function of noncommutative scale ( @xmath1 ) as well as the differential cross section @xmath37 for different values of @xmath1 .",
    "this differential distribution has been proposed in @xcite to identify the noncommutative effects .",
    "the feynman diagram for the @xmath36 process is shown in fig.[feynman ] .",
    "as it can be seen the process proceeds though @xmath38-channel via the exchange of a @xmath39-boson .",
    "it is noteable that the @xmath12 final state can be produced via the exchange of higgs boson that is not considered because of negiligble electron yukawa coupling .",
    "[ feynman ]    the feynman rule for the vertex @xmath40 is found to be @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the z - boson mass , @xmath43 is the vacuum expectation value . in the limit of @xmath44",
    "the vertex @xmath40 goes to @xmath45 that is compatible with the sm .",
    "the corresponding matrix element has the following form :    @xmath46    where @xmath47 , and @xmath48 denotes the weinberg angle . as it has been shown in fig.[feynman ] @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the four - momenta of electron , positron , higgs boson and z boson , respectively .",
    "the center - of - mass energy is denoted by @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the width of the @xmath39 boson . to calculate the total and differential cross section ,",
    "the equations of motion of the ingoing and outgoing particles are used .",
    "the mass of ingoing particles , @xmath55 , is ignored in the calculations .",
    "then the cross section is calculated using the center - of - mass frame for @xmath56 process : @xmath57 where @xmath23 is the polar angle and @xmath58 denotes the azimuthal angle . after some algebraic manipulations the total and diffenrential cross sections are obtained . in all calculations in this work",
    "the mass of the higgs boson is set to @xmath59 gev .",
    "the right plot of fig.[sigma ] shows the relative correction from noncommutativity to the total cross section of @xmath0 at the center - of - mass energies of 1 and 1.5 tev as a function of the noncommutatuve scale @xmath1 . as it can be seen , the noncommutative correction increases with increasing the center - of - mass energy of the collisions .",
    "because of the significant sensitivity of the total cross section , it can be used to set lower limits on the noncommutative scale .",
    "in addition to the total cross section , on the left side of fig.[sigma ] the differential cross section @xmath60 at @xmath61 tev is shown . from this plot , one can see that contrary to the sm case the distribution of @xmath60 behaves like @xmath62 . as it can be seen",
    "the noncommutativity leads the higgs boson to be emitted in an anisotropic way in the transvese plane .",
    "this is due to the violation of the angular momentum conservation in our noncommutatuve model .",
    "an interesting observation is that with increasing the noncommutative characteristic scale the amplitude of the oscillation decreases and goes to zero while the minimum and maximum positions do not change . in the next section",
    ", we will set limit on the noncommutative scale using the total cross section and the oscillatory behaviour of the emitted higgs bosons in the transverse plane .     versus the noncommutative scale @xmath1 ( left ) .",

    "using the fact that the background , @xmath30 within the sm ( @xmath63 ) , has a quite different shape in the @xmath60 distribution from the signal ( a flat shape versus an oscillating behaviour ) , a test statistic can be constructed .",
    "test statistic is a powerful tool to separate between signal ( noncommutativity ) and background and can enhance the separation power in comparison with other methods .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "we use the normalized @xmath58 distribution of the higgs boson to define our test statistic as the profile likelihood ratio between the two hypotheses of _ signal+background _ and only _ background _ : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is defined as : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the poisson distribution and @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the predicted numbers of signal and background events in bin @xmath70 of the azimuthal distribution of the higgs boson , respectively .",
    "we have histogrammed @xmath60 distribution of the higgs boson for the signal and background . in each bin of @xmath58 distribution @xmath71 ,",
    "in which @xmath72 denotes the integrated luminosity .",
    "the quantity @xmath73 is the profile likelihood ratio which means that for each one of the two values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 , a fit is performed over the model parameter to find the value which maximizes the likelihood .",
    "the tools for construction of the test statistics have been implemented in the roostats framework @xcite that is a c++ class library based on the roofit @xcite and root @xcite programs .",
    "the output is the limit on the model parameter that is the noncommutative characteristic scale @xmath1 .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[cls11 ] .",
    "it shows the lower limit on the noncommutative scale as a function of the integrated luminosity . as it can be seen the lower limit on @xmath1 grows up to around 1.2 tev when the integrated lumonisity reaches around 500 fb@xmath2 . then with increasing the integrated luminisity no improvement on the lower limit on @xmath1",
    "is observed .",
    "this is because of the fact that for @xmath76 tev and larger values , the oscillating behaviour in @xmath58 distribution looks like the sm background distribution considering the uncertainties .",
    "it shoud be mentioned here that this estimation is idealistic as no detector simulation has been performed .",
    "in addition , other backgrounds like @xmath77 have not been considered as well as all theoretical and instrumental systematic uncertainties . after considering all the effects one would expect the limits to be looser . to have a rough estimation of the detector and systematic effects we vary the number of events in each bin of @xmath58 distribution by @xmath78 to consider these effects as well as the background shape uncertainty and then recalculate the limit .",
    "we apply a gaussian smearing on each bin of the standard model @xmath58 distribution in order to consider an overall systematic uncertainties which change the shape of @xmath58 distribution . using @xmath79 a random number that belongs to a gaussian distribution with a mean value of @xmath80 and a standard deviation @xmath81",

    "the earth rotation effect on the @xmath87 process also could be at similar order while precise calculation is needed .",

    "no time dependent effect on the cross section has been observed .",
    "in this letter we have concentrated on higgs plus z - boson production at a future electron - positron collider to explore the sensitivity of future accelerator experiments to the noncommutativity .",

    "we used this feature to search for the signal of noncommutative theory using a test statistic technique .",
    "furthermore , by using a bayesian approach with some conservative assumptions for the backgrounds and efficiencies , conservative estimates obtained on the noncommutative scale .",
    "we find that the higgs boson angular distribution shape shows more sensitivity to the model parameter than the total cross section .",
    "it is shown that in this channel , the lower limit of 1.1 tev on @xmath1 can be achieved using 500 fb@xmath2 of data in electron - positron collisions at the center - of - mass energy of 1.5 tev .",
