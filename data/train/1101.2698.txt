    "there are two classical laws for the molecular liquids known more than a century .",
    "long time they were considered as mere curious facts restricted to the simple van der waals equation of state ( vdw eos ) .",
    "first of them is the law of the rectilinear diameter ( lrd ) @xcite .",
    "it states that the diameter of the coexistence curve in terms of density - temperature is the straight line : @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the densities of the liquid and the gas phases correspondingly , @xmath2 is the critical density , @xmath3 is the temperature .",
    "further we put the boltzmann constant to unit : @xmath4 .",
    "another simple linear relation is the batschinski law @xcite for the vdw eos : @xmath5 where @xmath6 - is the pressure .",
    "it states that the line determined by the condition @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the compressibility factor is the straight line : @xmath9 here @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the boyle temperature in the van der waals approximation and @xmath12 are the parameters of the vdw eos ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in general case of the spherically symmetrical potential @xmath13",
    "is determined in accordance with @xcite as following : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the attractive part of the full potential @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the effective diameter of the particle so that @xmath19 .",
    "the definition for the density parameter @xmath20 will be given below .",
    "the connection between two linear relations [ diameter_class ] and has attracted attention after work of herschbach&coll .",
    "@xcite , where the line @xmath21 was named by the zeno - line and it was shown that it is indeed almost straight for the normal fluids though the deviations are noticeable for the accurate data .",
    "the straightness of the zeno - line implies the constraint on the contact value of the radial distribution function @xcite .",
    "moreover , there are correlations between these linear elements and the locus of the critical point which were discovered in series of works of apfelbaum and vorobev @xcite .",
    "the authors put forward the creative idea about the tangency of the zeno - line to the liquid - vapor binodal extrapolated to the nonphysical region @xmath22 .",
    "this allowed to connect the locus of the cp with the parameters of the zeno - line : @xmath23 which are @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "they determine the intersection points for with the corresponding axes . according to former treatments @xcite",
    ", @xmath24 is the boyle temperature , i.e. @xmath26 and @xmath25 is determined by the relation : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the virial coefficient of @xmath29-th order @xcite .",
    "the relation fails at the vicinity of the critical point ( cp ) where the singular terms appear @xcite ( see also recent works @xcite ) .",
    "nonlinear deviations from the linearities and [ zeno_apfvor ] in low temperature region , e.g. for water can be associated with the presence of the anisotropic interactions like h - bonds @xcite . despite the deviations from the exactly linear behavior the relations [ diameter_class ] and are much more general and can be considered as the nontrivial extension of the principle of corresponding states @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that both [ diameter_class ] and as well as the correlations between these linear elements and the locus of the critical point can be considered as the consequence of the global mapping between the liquid - vapor part of the phase diagram and that of the lattice gas .",
    "the latter is described by the hamiltonian : @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the site filling number and @xmath32 whether the site is empty or occupied correspondingly .",
    "the quantity @xmath33 is the energy of the site - site interaction of the nearest sites @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the field conjugated to the filling variable @xmath37 .",
    "we denote by @xmath38 the temperature variable corresponding to the hamiltonian .",
    "the density parameter is the probability of occupation of the lattice site @xmath39 .",
    "if the lrd is assumed then such mapping is given by : @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath20 and @xmath13 are some parameters , which are connected with the coordinates of the cp : @xmath42 this transformation is uniquely determined by the correspondence between the characteristic _ linear _ elements on the phase diagrams of the fluid and the lg .",
    "it is assumed that the coordinates of the cp for the lg are normalized so that @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in such a context",
    "the parameter @xmath41 represents the class of the corresponding states @xcite .",
    "note that at @xmath45 and @xmath46 with @xmath47 from [ projtransfr_nx ] we get @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the application of the transformation to the calculation of the locus of the critical point of lennard - jones fluids is given in @xcite .",
    "the strong argument in favor of the choice of the linear element [ batschinski_vdw ] with the parameters @xmath50 instead of those for the zeno - line and the comparison of the values for various potentials are given in @xcite . there",
    "[ projtransfr_nx ] was used to map the binodal of the planar ising model onto the binodal of the two - dimensional lennard - jones fluid .",
    "the aim of this paper is to discuss physical basis of the linearities and on the liquid - vapor part of the phase diagram of the fluids .",
    "we will follow the results of @xcite .",
    "we expand some arguments of @xcite , which concern the corrected interpretation of the batchinski law in a way consistent with the van der waals approximation for the eos .",
    "also we derive the relation between the thermodynamic potentials for the continuum and the lattice models of fluids .",
    "it is easy to see that linear laws [ batschinski_vdw ] and are fulfilled trivially in the case of the lattice gas ( lg ) model or equivalently the ising model .",
    "indeed , the rectilinear diameter law for the lg is fulfilled due to the symmetry of the hamiltonian with respect to the line @xmath51 .",
    "the analog of the zeno - line for the lg can be defined too . in this case",
    "it is the line @xmath52 where the  holes  are absent .",
    "this is consistent with the basic expression for the compressibility factor @xcite : @xmath53 and the definition of the zeno - line as the one where the correlations determined by the repulsive and the attractive parts of the potential compensate each other .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath52 then the perfect configurational order takes place and the site - site correlation function of vanishes : @xmath54 thus the line @xmath52 plays the role of the zeno - line on the @xmath55 phase diagram of the lg . due to simple structure of the lg hamiltonian and explicit symmetries there are degenerate[degeneration ] elements of the phase diagram .",
    "the critical isochore @xmath56 coincides with the diameter .",
    "the zeno - line is the tangent to the binodal which in this case expands up into the region @xmath57 .",
    "thus there is the degeneration of these in the case of the lg . naturally , that both mentioned degenerations for the linear elements [ diameter_class ] and of the phase diagram disappear for the real fluids .",
    "the difference of the diameter and the isochore is nothing but the asymmetry of the binodal @xcite .",
    "the difference between the zeno - line and the tangent to the extrapolation of the binodal into the low temperature region @xmath22 takes place only for the vdw eos and influences directly the approach of @xcite .",
    "the latter is based heavily of the constraint of the tangency to the extrapolation of the binodal .",
    "in fact there is no physical reasons to identify such tangent line with the zeno - line .",
    "this is possible only for the vdw eos . using the generalized van der waals approach of @xcite any eos can be approximated by the vdw eos with the corresponding parameters .",
    "the definition of the tangent linear element [ batschinski_vdw ] relies upon the van der waals approximation for the given eos and therefore does not coincide with the zeno - line .",
    "the value of @xmath20 is determined by the condition analogous to : @xmath58 this relation follows from the constraint : @xmath59 which generalizes the condition @xmath60 and implies the linear change of the compressibility factor with the temperature @xmath3 along the linear element .",
    "the proposed simple relation between the lg and the fluid may be useful for construction of the empirical eos for the real substances .",
    "recently , the nonlinear generalization of has been proposed in @xcite : @xmath61 with @xmath62 as the fitting parameter .",
    "unfortunately , the physical meaning of the parameter @xmath62 and its connection with the interaction potential was not discussed .",
    "moreover from the basic thermodynamical reasonings the extensive parameters such as number of particles in the lg and in fluid should be proportional unless the fluctuational effects are taken into account .",
    "the lasts are the source of the fluctuational induced shift of the mean - field position of the critical point @xcite . so the modification of the in order to obtain the exact position of the critical point should be based on the inclusion of the fluctuation effects and their scaling properties . in @xcite",
    "it was shown how the relations [ projtransfr_nx ] augmented with some scaling considerations allow to obtain the critical points of the lennard - jones fluids basing on the properties of the potentials . the difference between @xmath63 and @xmath13 , @xmath25 and",
    "@xmath20 is indeed essential especially in high dimensions @xmath64 @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we propose the generalization of the transformation for the procedure of the symmetrization of the binodal of the fluid which preserve the correspondence between the extensive thermodynamic quantities .",
    "we believe that the key point which determines the form of the mapping is the lrd .",
    "the linear element [ batschinski_vdw ] plays auxiliary role and defines the proper scales for the density and the temperature .",
    "as was shown earlier in @xcite the transformation allows to map the binodal @xmath65 of the lennard - jones fluid onto the binodal @xmath66 of the corresponding lattice gas model .",
    "the latter has explicitly symmetric shape with respect to the critical isochore @xmath67 : @xmath68 due to the particle - hole symmetry of the hamiltonian [ ham_latticegas ] .",
    "thus one can treat as the procedure of the symmetrization of the phase diagram . indeed , suppose that @xmath69 is the dependence of the density diameter .",
    "then the variable @xmath70 is symmetrical over the binodal . with this",
    "may be generalized as following : @xmath71 where the parametrization function @xmath72 is chosen so that to map the binodal of the fluid @xmath65 onto the binodal of the lg @xmath66 .",
    "it can be found from the common conditions of the thermodynamic equilibrium : @xmath73 .",
    "the equality of the chemical potentials is fulfilled due to symmetry of the binodal of the lg ( see also section  [ sec_trmdfunctions ] ) .",
    "the transformation is the particular case for which : @xmath74    in the simplest _ linear _ approximation for the temperature behavior of the diameter @xmath75 of the form [ diameter_class ] , obviously : @xmath76 the unknown parametrization function @xmath72 is determined by the condition @xmath77 to illustrate this procedure let us consider the classical vdw eos . using the symmetry of the lg representation [ linear_parametriz ] with respect to @xmath44 it is convenient to represent the densities of the coexisting phases as @xmath78 and @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "substituting these relations into where the pressure @xmath6 is given by we get simple algebraic equation for the value @xmath72 : @xmath81 as a function of @xmath82 . in accordance with this provides the symmetrization of the binodal of the vdw eos in terms of the lg variable @xmath82 the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ising_vdw ] .",
    "the corresponding coordinates of the critical point in accordance with [ linear_parametriz ] are : @xmath83     +    the difference between the exact values @xmath84 is caused by the deviation of the diameter for the vdw eos form the linear behavior .",
    "as we see the differences are rather small .",
    "thus simple parametrization can be applied to any eos where the deviation from the lrd can be neglected . in this case",
    "the symmetrization of the binodal described by the parametrization or [ linear_parametriz ] along with the eos for the lg could be useful in processing the data of the simulations for the coexistence curve ( cc ) of the lennard - jones fluids , where simple approximate formula : @xmath85 is used @xcite .",
    "also the proposed approach allows to avoid ambiguity in extrapolation of the binodal into the region @xmath22 @xcite .    in order to visualize",
    "how the splitting of the degenerate elements mentioned above ( see p.  ) occurs it is expedient to consider the application of the transformation to the classical eos for the lg the curie - weiss molecular field approximation ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this equation of state has the form - field conjugated to variable @xmath86 and the @xmath82-field conjugated to @xmath82 because it is irrelevant for our consideration . ] : @xmath87 the isotherms for this model eos are shown in [ fig_p_widomline ]  ( a ) .",
    "the linear character of the transformation with respect to the order parameters @xmath82 and @xmath29 allows to connect the pressure for the asymmetrical liquid @xmath88 with that of the lg as follows : @xmath89 the dependence @xmath90 will be obtained in section  [ sec_trmdfunctions ] ( see below ) .",
    "the pressure for the lg @xmath91 and in particular for eos [ cw_eos ] can be defined by the standard method ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "taking into account the conjugation of the thermodynamic variables we can write : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the thermodynamic potential for the variables @xmath94 .",
    "it is constructed easily using eos so that : @xmath95    substituting into we are able to construct the isotherms in @xmath96 plane .",
    "the result of construction of the isotherms and the binodal of the  fluid  in coordinates  pressure - density  basing on the curie - weiss eos for the lg is shown in [ fig_p_widomline ] .    in the following section we discuss the relation between the thermodynamic functions of the lg and its continuum analog in detail .     +",
    "basing on the analysis of @xcite one can expect that the transformation gives the relation between phase diagram of the lg and that of the real fluid at least as the  zeroth order approximation  .",
    "the idea that the difference between irregularity configuration for continuum fluids and regularity of configurations of lattice models is unimportant for consideration of the order - disorder transitions in the fluctuational region is due to k.s .",
    "pitzer ( see @xcite ) . but beyond the fluctuational region the shape of the holes in real or continuum liquid and that in the lattice gas causes the main difference between the configurations of these systems .",
    "from this point of view the global character of the transformation [ projtransfr_nx ] shows that the particle - hole simplified picture still can be useful .",
    "though , it is not the particle density which reflects such symmetry .",
    "rather the combination of the density of the particles and the density of the holes is the symmetrical variable ( see p.  ) .",
    "this rehabilitates the hole theory for expanded liquids @xcite .",
    "such caricature picture of the liquid state gives the possibility to relate the thermodynamic functions of these systems .",
    "let @xmath97 are the thermodynamic potentials of the grand canonical ensembles for the lg and the fluid correspondingly . here",
    "@xmath98 is the number of sites in a lattice .",
    "first it is natural to state the following relation @xmath99 between the extensive variables of these ensembles .",
    "the results of  @xcite allow to interpret @xmath100 as the volume per particle in the ideal crystal state at @xmath22 .",
    "such a state defines the lattice which may serve as the basis for the determination of the corresponding lattice gas model .    using the standard definitions : @xmath101 along with we",

    "it is given by .",
    "the compressibility is calculated using the curie - weiss eos with subsequent transformation .,title=\"fig : \" ] +    therefore @xmath108 defined by can be considered as the widom - stillinger line of symmetry for the liquid @xcite . indeed , such line is defined as the locus of maximum of correlation length where the thermodynamic response function such as the isothermal compressibility @xmath114 has maxima @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "obviously , in case of the lg it is represented by the line @xmath107 , or equivalently by the critical isochore @xmath113 .",
    "the widom - stillinger line has attracted much attention recently in the studies on supercritical states of liquids @xcite .",
    "the stated mapping between the lg and the fluid naturally explains the separation of the fluid region into the gas - like and the liquid - like states with the widom line as the border .",
    "the gas - like region is the image of the region @xmath116 where the number of holes is greater than the number of particles . for the liquid - like region @xmath117",
    "the situation is inverse .",
    "the line is the image of the line @xmath107 .",
    "therefore along this line the continuation of the subcritical behavior ( divergence ) of the isothermal compressibility @xmath118 takes place .",
    "[ fig_compress_widomline ] shows the result of the calculations for the compressibility @xmath118 in accordance with the relation [ transfm_potentials ] between the fluid and the lg .",
    "this is the locus of the compressibility maxima .    from the relation between the entropy @xmath119 of the lg and that of the fluid @xmath120 can be derived : @xmath121    the results described above",
    "illustrate the general analysis of @xcite .",
    "the mapping [ projtransfr_nx ] determines the fluid as the asymmetric model for the symmetric lg .",
    "the conservation of the rdl is due to the direct relation between the the thermodynamic potentials [ transfm_potentials ] . indeed ,",
    "if linear relation between @xmath122 and @xmath123 with the analytic coefficients holds , then the quantity @xmath124 has the rectilinear diameter .",
    "this order parameter is the combination of the density and the entropy @xcite .    in order to be physically meaningful , the transformation [ projtransfr_nx ] or its generalization should appear as the average of the transformation of the microscopic variables .",
    "we assume that there exist such transformation which leads to the symmetrization of the binodal .",
    "the similarity between the liquid - vapor part of the diagram for the fluid and that of the lg and also the separation between the liquid - like and gas -like states ( see e.g. @xcite ) allows to state that for the case of fluids there exists the  asymmetrical ",
    "microscopic observable @xmath125 such that:[page_symmorder ] @xmath126 here @xmath127 stands for the averages on the corresponding coexisting liquid and gaseous states with @xmath128 and @xmath129 . in terms of @xcite the equilibrium average",
    "@xmath130 is the density - like variable , which takes different values in the coexisting phases .",
    "the specific form of the observable depends on the hamiltonian of the fluid .",
    "such observable exists in case of penetrable sphere models where the relation between the thermodynamic potentials @xmath6 and @xmath131 is linear @xcite .",
    "in fact the right hand side in [ adiam ] can be any analytic function of @xmath3 ( including the neighborhood of the cp ) .",
    "in such case it is possible to redefine @xmath125 so that is fulfilled .",
    "then the following equation @xmath132 determines the continuation @xmath108 of the diameter into the supercritical region @xmath133 .",
    "once such observable is determined the corresponding thermodynamic potential can be defined so that @xmath134 in general @xmath135 depends on the field variables @xmath136 nonlinearly .",
    "therefore , in accordance with @xcite the density diameter shows both @xmath137 and @xmath138 anomalies .",
    "since the singularity of the diameter is of fluctuational nature the transformation should be considered as the mean - field approximation for the transformation between microscopic fields ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the fact of the global cubic shape of the cc for the molecular liquids is the long standing issue and was well known to van der waals due to studies of verschaffelt @xcite ( see also the review @xcite ) .",
    "it is also well established fact for a wide variety of the lennard - jones fluids with the short ranged interactions .",
    "the results of computer simulations are well described by the guggenheim - like expression [ cubicextrapol ] ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the transformation states that the shape of the cc for the molecular fluids is determined by that for the lg @xcite . as is known from the computer simulations @xcite the crossover to the classical behavior which is characterized by the parabolic shape of the binodal is absent for the lg with the nearest neighbors interaction . on the basis of the global character of the transformation",
    "one can assume that the same is true for the molecular fluids with the short - ranged potentials .",
    "in other words , the binodal of the molecular fluid can be described approximately by the global cubic dependence similar to in a broad temperature interval . in @xcite",
    "this statement was demonstrated for 2d and 3d lennard - jones fluids .",
    "in particular the binodal of the 2d lennard - jones fluid was obtained as the image of the binodal of the 2d ising model given by the onsager exact solution .",
    "in such a case very flat shape of the binodal dome of 2d fluid is due to the exponent @xmath139 and the global nature of the power - like dependence of the binodal of the 2d lg : @xmath140 note that @xmath141 is the analytic function of the lg temperature variable @xmath38 .",
    "the classical landau theory of the phase transitions gives the general picture which is characterized by the classical exponents for the critical asymptotics of the thermodynamic quantities @xcite .",
    "in particular the dome of the binodal is given by the the quadratic curve .",
    "but it should be stressed that the landau theory breaks the continual character of change of the thermodynamic state in passing through the cp .",
    "indeed , there is the discontinuity of the specific heat @xmath142 and therefore there is no unique critical state but still there are two coexisting phases .",
    "this discontinuity is connected with the assumption of the existence of the only strongly fluctuating quantity . for the liquid - vapor critical point",
    "such quantity is the density . indeed ,",
    "if the entropy is used as the order parameter then the finite jump of the specific heat allows to distinguish between the ordered and the disordered phase at the cp . besides , the parabolic shape of the binodal is the consequence of the usage of analytic eos with applying the maxwell construction for the pair of conjugated variables ( e.g. the pressure and the volume ) in the subcritical region .",
    "this puts the constraint of analyticity of the binodal in terms of other pair of the variables , e.g. the temperature and the entropy .",
    "note that in the vicinity of the critical point @xmath143 should be the even function of the order parameter ( see ) .",
    "one can expect that weak divergence of the specific heat admits the analyticity of the function @xmath143 .",
    "then @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the integer .",
    "obviously , this occurs in @xmath146 and @xmath147 , where the specific heat has weak logarithmic divergence or finite jump with @xmath148 and @xmath149 correspondingly . for @xmath150",
    "the specific heat diverges more strongly .",
    "therefore one could expect that the analyticity of @xmath143 breaks in this case .    to clarify where the possibility for the global cubic shape of the binodal appears let us consider the @xmath151 phase diagram of the lg ( ising model ) .",
    "we use the ising - like order parameter @xmath152 for the convenience and consider the family of the _ iso_-@xmath36 curves @xmath153 for the lg . notably , all these curves has the inflection points @xmath154 .",
    "[ fig_ising_1 ] shows the situation for the curie - weiss eos .",
    "obviously , in the vicinity of the inflection point @xmath154 determined by the condition : @xmath155 the function @xmath153 has the cubic form ( see [ fig_ising_1 ] ) : @xmath156 where the coefficients @xmath157 and @xmath158 are the odd functions of @xmath36 .",
    "naturally , the binodal as the line of the phase equilibrium is the curve which correspond to @xmath107 . from this point of view",
    "the binodal consists of two parts .",
    "they are the limiting curves of the families of cubics with @xmath159 and @xmath160 correspondingly ( see fig .  [ fig_ising_1 ] ) .",
    "therefore the binodal as the limiting curve for these families should have the cubic form : @xmath161 or , equivalently @xmath162 where @xmath163 in the mean - field approximation @xmath164 in the cp .",
    "but the analysis of the simplest curie - weiss approximation shows that it is reasonable to use the extrapolated value @xmath165 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_t3ising_widomline ] ) .     in the curie - weiss approximation .",
    "the extrapolation is shown by the dashed line.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    from we obtain the value of the amplitude for the binodal opening @xmath166 .",
    "surprisingly , this coincides with the result of the corresponding value obtained in the computer simulations for the 3d ising model @xcite . under the transformation [ projtransfr_nx ]",
    "the iso-@xmath36 lines map onto the corresponding ones in @xmath96 plane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_ising_1 ] ) . obviously , the local cubic character similar to near the inflection points takes place . approaching the cp we obtain the relation between the amplitudes of the lg and the continuum fluid : @xmath167 in accordance with the results @xcite for the lennard - jones fluids , where the attractive part of the interaction has the  @xmath168  behavior , @xmath169 in @xmath150",
    "then , from and we get : @xmath170 which is good agreement with the value obtained in computer simulations @xmath171 for potentials of  @xmath172",
    " type @xcite .",
    "this allows to treat the value @xmath173 as the corresponding exponent which conforms with the continuity of the critical state for @xmath150 for the systems isomorphic to the lg .",
    "other critical indices , except the small ones @xmath174 and @xmath175 which in the mean - field approximation are zeroth , can be obtained via the standard thermodynamic stability and scaling reasonings , so that @xmath176 etc .",
    "in this paper the explicit relations between the basic thermodynamic functions of the lg and the continuum fluid is derived within the global isomorphism approach proposed in @xcite .",
    "these relations allow to obtain the information about liquid state directly from the eos for the lattice model .",
    "it is quite remarkable since the lattice models do not contain the translational degrees of freedom . nevertheless , as it follows from the results @xcite this mapping gives rather good description for the lj fluids .",
    "in particular the stated relations can be used to connect the computer simulations for the lattice models with those for the continuum fluids ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "within such an approach the splitting between critical isochore and the diameter , the zeno - line and the tangent to the binodal at @xmath22 is naturally described .",
    "the conservation of linear character of the diameter allows to obtain simple form of the transformation between the phase diagram of the lg and the continuum fluid . obviously , the value of the critical density is the most sensitive to such approximation .",
    "but for the computer simulations the deviations from the law of rectilinear diameters are small to observe them near the cp @xcite .",
    "this explains rather good agreement of the estimates for the locus of the cp based on the parametrization for the lennard - jones fluids with the results of the computer simulations @xcite .",
    "we believe that the approach proposed could be useful in studies of the supercritical behavior basing on the eos of the lattice models especially for water @xcite where a lot of lattice models , including the models with h - bond are known . in view of the results of work @xcite it would be interesting to generalize the proposed approach in order to search the correspondence between the dynamic response functions of fluids and their lattice analogues .",
    "this poses the question about the choice of the adequate lattice model of the proper geometry and the type of the interaction which realizes the isomorphism with the corresponding fluid .",
