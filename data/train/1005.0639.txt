    "understanding the details of galaxy formation remains an important challenge in cosmology . as shown by numerical calculations",
    ", the first generation of galaxies should have formed at very high redshifts inside collapsing halos , starting at @xmath12 , corresponding to high peaks of the primordial dark matter ( dm ) density field @xcite .",
    "cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation observations suggest that reionization began at high redshifts .",
    "this means that a high abundance of luminous objects must have existed at that time , since these first luminous objects are expected to have heated and reionized their surroundings @xcite .",
    "the formation of a luminous object inside a halo necessarily requires the existence of baryonic gas there . even in halos that are too small for cooling via atomic hydrogen ,",
    "the gas content can have substantial , and observable , astrophysical effects .",
    "in addition to the possibility of hosting astrophysical sources , such as stars , small halos may produce a 21-cm signature @xcite , and can block ionizing radiation and produce an overall delay in the global progress of reionization @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the halo gas fraction at various epochs of the universe is of prime importance , particularly in the early universe .",
    "we evaluate here the possible influence of a primordial magnetic field on the halo gas fraction .",
    "as noted by @xcite , both in the linear and non - linear regimes , the accretion of gas into dm halos is suppressed below a characteristic mass scale called the filtering mass , @xmath2 .",
    "this mass scale coincides with the jeans mass , @xmath13 , if the latter does not vary in time . otherwise , @xmath2 is a time average of @xmath13 .",
    "thus , an increase in the ambient pressure in the past , causes an increase in @xmath13 and suppresses the accretion of baryons into dm halos in a cumulative fashion , producing an increase in @xmath2 .    until now ,",
    "studies focused on the uv heating of the neutral interstellar gas as the main source of pressure , for determining the filtering mass .",
    "these results are widely used in many semi - analytic models ( e.g. @xcite ) , particularly those designed to study the properties of small galaxies ( due to the high redshift character of the uv heating ) .    in this paper",
    "we add the effect of a possible random primordial magnetic field as another important source of ambient pressure .",
    "the magnetic field contributes to pressure support , which changes the jeans mass and , consequently , the filtering mass and the quantity of gas that is accreted by dm halos .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : magnetic ]",
    "we make a short review on the possible origins of primordial magnetic fields , in section [ sec : filtering ] we analyze the effect of primordial magnetic fields on the jeans and filtering masses and in section [ sec : gas ] we calculate effects on the baryon mass fraction . in section [ sec : conc ] we give our conclusions .",
    "the origin of large - scale cosmic magnetic fields in galaxies and protogalaxies remains a challenging problem in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "understanding the origin of the structures of the present universe requires a knowledge of the origin of magnetic fields .",
    "the magnetic fields fill interstellar and intracluster space and affect the evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "there have been many attempts to explain the origin of cosmic magnetic fields .",
    "one of the most popular astrophysical theories for creating seed primordial fields is that they were generated by the biermann mechanism @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that this mechanism acts in diverse astrophysical systems , such as large scale structure formation @xcite , protogalaxies @xcite , cosmological ionizing fronts @xcite , star formation and supernova explosions @xcite .",
    "another mechanism for creating cosmic magnetic fields was suggested by @xcite .",
    "they investigated the second - order couplings between photons and electrons as a possible origin of magnetic fields on cosmological scales before the epoch of recombination .",
    "studies of magnetic field generation , based on cosmological perturbations , have also been made @xcite .    in our galaxy ,",
    "the magnetic field is coherent over kpc scales with alternating directions in the arm and inter - arm regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such alternations are expected for magnetic fields of primordial origin @xcite .",
    "various observations put upper limits on the intensity of a homogeneous primordial magnetic field .",
    "observations of the small - scale cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy yield an upper comoving limit of @xmath14 for a homogeneous primordial field @xcite .",
    "reionization of the universe puts upper limits of @xmath15 for a homogeneous primordial field , depending on the assumptions of the stellar population that is responsible for reionizing the universe @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the fluctuations of the plasma predicted by the fluctuation dissipation theorem , after the quark - hadron transition ( qht ) , is a natural source for a present primordial magnetic field .",
    "they evolved the fluctuations after the qht to the present era and predict a present cosmic web of random primordial magnetic fields .",
    "the average magnetic field predicted by them over a region of size @xmath16 is @xmath17 .",
    "an average magnetic field @xmath18 over a @xmath19  kpc region at @xmath20 is , thus , predicted .",
    "following the procedure of a previous work @xcite , which studied the effects of a homogeneous primordial magnetic field , we study here the influence of random inhomogeneous primordial magnetic fields ( rpmf ) on the filtering mass @xmath2 .",
    "this quantity describes the highest dm mass scale for which the baryon accretion is suppressed significantly , as we will discuss below .",
    "first , we define the filtering scale @xcite as the characteristic length scale over which the baryonic perturbations are smoothed out as compared to the dark matter ones as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the density contrast of baryonic matter and @xmath23 , the total density contrast . for @xmath24",
    "comparable to @xmath25 , the density contrast @xmath22 is severely depressed .    as was shown by @xcite",
    ", we can relate the comoving wavenumber associated with this length scale with the jeans wavenumber by the equation @xmath26,\\label{eq : kj}\\ ] ] where a flat matter dominated universe is assumed .",
    "one finds that the overall suppression of the growth of baryonic density perturbations depends on a time - average of the jeans scale . by translating the length scales into mass scales",
    ", we can then define the jeans mass and filtering mass , @xmath27    from equations ( [ eq : mjmf ] ) and ( [ eq : kj ] ) , we can write , @xmath28\\text { , } \\label{eq : filtering}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the mean matter density .",
    "the commonly used jeans mass , with negligible magnetic fields , is the mass when the gravitational pressure at the surface of a sphere of radius @xmath30 balances the thermal pressure .",
    "an adiabatic compression of the sphere by a change in radius @xmath31 increases the thermal pressure above the gravitational pressure , causing the sphere to increase its radius and oscillate about the equilibrium value @xmath30 .",
    "when the thermal pressure is negligible and we only have random magnetic fields in the sphere , the definition of the jeans mass is similar .",
    "it is the mass when the magnetic pressure at the surface balances the gravitational pressure .",
    "an adiabatic compression of the sphere of radius @xmath30 by a change in radius @xmath31 increases the magnetic pressure above the gravitational pressure , making the sphere , again , increase its radius and oscillate about the radius @xmath30 .      for a random magnetic field , the magnetic pressure in a region of comoving size @xmath16 greater than the comoving size of a magnetic cell , @xmath0 ,",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath32 with the following expression for the rms average of the field @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath1 is the field intensity in an individual cell , and the parameter @xmath34 depends on the geometry of the field considered ( section [ sec : cell ] ) .",
    "for @xmath35 , the average is being made inside a single cell .",
    "thus , the field is indistinguishable from a homogeneous field @xcite , and we have @xmath36      equations ( [ eq : brms ] ) and ( [ eq : brms2 ] ) can be improved taking into account the turbulent enhancement of @xmath37 at large length scales , which occurs until @xmath37 reaches equipartition with the kinetic energy of the plasma .",
    "an inverse cascade effect occurs , where small magnetic structures merge to form larger magnetic structures , transferring energy to larger length scales .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that the total enhancement can be written as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the eddy turn over time of the intergalactic turbulence .",
    "the mean value of @xmath39 is @xmath40 years @xcite .",
    "thus , equations ( [ eq : brms ] ) and ( [ eq : brms2 ] ) become @xmath41    when the field reaches equipartition , the turbulent amplification stops . to take into account this effect in our calculations",
    ", we set an upper limit to the magnetic field of @xmath42 for the comoving strength of the field when averaged over 1 kpc .",
    "this is consistent with the expected values for magnetic fields in equipartition with the environment in regions around clusters and groups @xcite .",
    "this also consistent with tests that we made stopping the amplification when @xmath43 .",
    "it is to be noted that it is not the alfvenic speed , determined by @xmath1 , which sets the timescale for an overdensity to respond to perturbations .",
    "a simple example shows this .",
    "let a perturbation be made along the magnetic field , @xmath1 , in a given cell on the surface of the sphere .",
    "in that cell the alfvenic speed is determined by @xmath1 .",
    "let us assume that the perturbation enters a neighboring cell that could have its field @xmath1 perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the perturbation .",
    "in this neighboring cell the alfven velocity of the perturbation is zero since alfvenic perturbations can propagate only along the field . from the above example",
    ", we conclude that in a sphere of randomly oriented cells , the velocity of perturbations is not the alfven velocity defined by @xmath1 , but is determined by the average magnetic pressure determined by @xmath44 .",
    "we are interested in obtaining the appropriate jeans wave number , @xmath45 , for a sphere of radius @xmath16 containing randomly oriented magnetic cells of size @xmath0 with average magnetic fields @xmath1 .",
    "the usually used @xmath45 , when magnetic fields are negligible , is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the speed of sound . in such a sphere",
    ", the speed of sound sets the timescale for an overdensity to respond to perturbations , and is directly related to the pressure .    in a sphere with a homogeneous magnetic field , @xmath48 , the speed of a perturbation propagating perpendicular to @xmath48 is @xmath49 , the magneto - acoustic velocity , which sets the timescale .",
    "the energy density in the sphere is @xmath50 .    in our case of random magnetic fields ,",
    "the average energy density in the sphere is @xmath51 .",
    "we may , then , expect that the characteristic velocity in our sphere of random magnetic cells is approximately given by the expression for the magneto - acoustic velocity given above , with the energy density @xmath50 replaced by @xmath51 .",
    "defining an effective alfven velocity by @xmath52 , the characteristic velocity of a perturbation in our sphere is , then , @xmath53 .    replacing @xmath47 by @xmath54 ( in the usual expression for @xmath45 when there is negligible magnetic fields ) we then have @xmath55 which we use in this paper .",
    "thus , the jeans mass of a plasma , subject to magnetic pressure , is given by @xmath56 where we use @xmath57 , with @xmath58 being the mass of a hydrogen atom , @xmath59 the mean molecular weight and @xmath60 the boltzmann constant .",
    "this expression generalizes previous calculations of the jeans mass which only considered its limiting cases : @xmath61 , the usual jeans mass ( e.g. @xcite ) , or @xmath62 , the magnetic jeans mass ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in order to choose the correct @xmath63 from either equation ( [ eq : brms ] ) or ( [ eq : brms2 ] ) , we first calculate the ( comoving ) jeans length , @xmath64 , from equations ( [ eq : brms2 ] ) and ( [ eq : jeans ] ) , in which we assume a multi - cell regime    @xmath65 ^ 3\\text { .}\\label{eq : lm}\\ ] ]    where @xmath66 and we used @xmath67 and @xmath68    if @xmath69 , then @xmath64 is the comoving jeans length and the jeans mass is given by the solution of @xmath70 ^ 3\\text{. } \\label{eq : jeansfinal}\\ ] ]    if @xmath71 , then the average is done inside a single cell , using equation ( [ eq : brms2 ] ) , and the jeans mass is given by @xmath72 ^ 3 \\label{eq : jeanshom}\\text { .}\\ ] ]      we study primordial magnetic fields in the form of randomly oriented cells considering two possible scenarios for the seed field .",

    "thus , an average over large volumes corresponds to a random walk of all possible inclinations .",
    "this is equivalent a random walk on a 2d surface of a sphere , which implies @xmath74 .      in order to calculate the jeans and filtering masses from equations ( [ eq : filtering ] ) and ( [ eq : jeansfinal ] )",
    ", it is necessary to have an expression for the evolution of the temperature of the gas with redshift .",
    "we use the analytic fit of the temperature as a function of redshift that @xcite obtained for the results of @xcite , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the epoch before the first hii regions form , @xmath77 is the epoch of the overlap of multiple hii regions and @xmath78 is the epoch of complete reionization .    throughout this paper",

    "we use equations ( [ eq : jeansfinal ] ) , ( [ eq : jeanshom ] ) and ( [ eq : temp ] ) in ( [ eq : filtering ] ) to calculate the effect of rpmf on the filtering mass .",

    "the model proposed by @xcite leads to dipole - like field with a comoving @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "this curve deviates only slightly from the case of no magnetic field , in figure [ fig : filter7 ] .",
    "we found that most models where magnetic fields are generated during a quark - hadron phase transition  which would have dipole - like fields with @xmath84 and @xmath85 @xcite , or @xmath86 and @xmath83 @xcite  or during an electroweak phase transition  ring - like fields with @xmath87 to @xmath88 and @xmath89 @xcite  have negligible effects on the filtering mass .",
    "observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) lead to an upper limit on the homogeneous primordial magnetic field @xmath90 ( comoving ) @xcite with @xmath91 .",
    "this limit corresponds to the brown curve plotted in figures [ fig : filter8 ] , [ fig : filter8turb ] , [ fig : filter8ring ] and [ fig : filter8ringturb ]",
    ". there is , thus , a family of possible models to explain the origin of cosmic magnetic fields in the early universe that can create a difference in the filtering mass between @xmath92 and is in agreement with the cmb constraints .",
