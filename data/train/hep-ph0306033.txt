    "since the famous emc experiment @xcite at cern in 1988 there has been great interest in the polarized quark distributions of the proton and neutron .",
    "the reason for this interest in the spin dependent structure of the nucleon is that the emc experiment ( and other polarized dis experiments @xcite ) could be interpreted as showing that the quarks carry only a small proportion of the total angular momentum of the proton .",
    "a further conclusion , made using su(3 ) flavour arguments , is that the strange sea quarks in the proton are strongly polarized opposite to the polarization of the proton @xcite .",
    "both these results are much at odds with expectations based on constituent quark models of the nucleon .",
    "further experiments have generally confirmed the emc results for the proton - photon asymmetry @xmath2 and proton spin structure function @xmath3 , as well as extending these to deuteron and neutron targets @xcite and to the second nucleon - photon asymmetries @xmath4 and the related structure functions @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "all these experiments have been inclusive scattering using the virtual photon as the probe of nucleon structure . unfortunately no experiments have been performed using neutrino scattering , where one of the vector bosons is the probe .",
    "thus there is no information on the spin dependent analogue of the unpolarized structure function @xmath6 .",
    "this makes the decomposition of the measured structure functions into ` valence ' and ` sea ' parts very difficult , and flavour decomposition much harder to do than in the unpolarized case .",
    "however the hermes collaboration @xcite has recently reported the first results from its semi - inclusive scattering measurements , where final state pions and kaons are measured .",
    "this provides a method to extract the spin dependent quark distribution of a given flavour , supposing that we have enough information about the relevant fragmentation functions @xmath7 .",
    "the hermes collaboration s first semi - inclusive results have been able to extract the ratios of spin dependent to spin independent quark distributions @xmath8 .",
    "in contrast to earlier flavour decompositions @xcite , which have needed su(3 ) flavour symmetry assumptions for the sea distributions @xmath9 , the only symmetry assumption made in the hermes data analysis is that @xmath10 . in the context of the earlier results from inclusive dis , the results for the spin dependent sea quark distributions @xmath11 are rather surprising : the polarization of each flavour is very small , and compatible with zero",
    "this may imply a breaking of su(3 ) flavour symmetry .    with this new data in mind",
    ", it is important that other sources of information on the spin dependent sea quark distributions be examined . in particular model calculations of the parton distributions",
    "can provide some insight into whether the antiquark polarizations can be expected to be large or small , and whether the sign of the polarization is positive or negative .",
    "in this paper we will investigate the spin dependent sea quark distribution functions ( @xmath12 ) in the context of the meson cloud model ( mcm ) .",
    "in this model the physical nucleon wavefunction contains virtual meson - baryon components which ` dress ' the bare nucleon . the mcm provides a natural explanation for symmetry breaking among the parton distributions , in particular the flavour asymmetry in the unpolarized nucleon sea @xmath13 @xcite seen in the nmc @xcite and e866 @xcite experiments .",
    "thus it is reasonable to ask whether the violation of the ellis - jaffe sum rule @xcite can also be explained in this model . in previous calculations @xcite",
    "it has been shown that including effects of the meson cloud significantly lowers the value of @xmath14 , which is the total spin carried by the quarks and anti - quarks .",
    "this arises firstly because of ` dilution ' of the bare proton quark distributions by those of the cloud and secondly from the inclusion of non s - wave components in the cloud wavefunction , which effectively increases the proportion of the proton spin due to orbital angular momentum .",
    "boros and thomas @xcite studied the effects of strange mesons and baryons in the cloud by considering @xmath15 and @xmath16 components in the fock wavefunction of the proton and found that the polarization of the strange sea was small @xmath17",
    ". however higher mass components in the fock wavefunction , in particular @xmath18 and @xmath19 , can have important effects on the strange see .",
    "our recent investigation of the unpolarized strange sea @xcite has shown that although these higher mass components may be kinematically suppressed , they have large couplings to the nucleon , and numerically give amplitudes of similar size to the lowest mass states .",
    "also the @xmath20 is a vector meson , so any polarization of the anti - strange quark in the @xmath20 will give a contribution to the @xmath21 distribution of the proton , whereas there can be no such contribution from the @xmath22 of the kaon .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we have calculated the flavour asymmetry @xmath23 in the mcm .",
    "these results are consistent with the hermes data . here",
    "we shall extend that calculation to consider each of the light antiquark flavours separately .",
    "thus the fluctuations that contribute to @xmath24 and @xmath25 equally and make no contributions to @xmath23 are now included .",
    "in addition to the mcm contribution to the light polarised antiquark distributions there may be other contributions to these distributions . these would be mainly non - perturbative , arising from the distributions in the bare nucleon , and would need to be calculated in some model of the bare nucleon _",
    "e.g. _ the mit bag model .",
    "these contributions are not necessarily small , however we shall see that the hermes data does constrain the size of these bare distributions .",
    "perturbative contributions to the light polarised antiquark distributions , which come from qcd evolution from the model scale ( @xmath26 gev@xmath27 ) up to experimental scales , are expected to be small as the first moment of these distributions changes rather slowly with @xmath28 .    in the section 2 of this paper we review the meson cloud model , and derive the necessary expressions for calculating the polarised antiquark distributions .",
    "this will include the contributions of @xmath18 and @xmath19 components of the cloud . in section 3",
    "we present a non - perturbative calculation for the polarized parton distributions ( pdfs ) of the hyperons and mesons .",
    "the numerical results and discussions are given in section 4 .",
    "the last section is reserved for a summary .",
    "in the meson cloud model ( mcm ) @xcite the nucleon can be viewed as a bare nucleon plus some baryon - meson fock states which result from the fluctuation of nucleon to baryon plus meson @xmath29 .",
    "the wavefunction of the nucleon can be written as @xcite , |n_physical = z    [ nmcm ] where @xmath30 is the wave function renormalization constant , @xmath31 is the wave function of the fock state containing a baryon ( @xmath32 ) with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath33 , transverse momentum @xmath34 , and helicity @xmath35 , and a meson ( @xmath36 ) with momentum fraction @xmath37 , transverse momentum @xmath38 , and helicity @xmath39 .",
    "the model assumes that the lifetime of a virtual baryon - meson fock state is much longer than the interaction time in the deep inelastic or drell - yan process , thus the quark and anti - quark in the virtual baryon - meson fock states can contribute to the parton distributions of the nucleon .",
    "these non - perturbative contributions can be calculated via a convolution between the fluctuation function , which describes the microscopic process @xmath29 , and the quark ( anti - quark ) distributions of the hadrons in the fock states @xmath40 in eq .",
