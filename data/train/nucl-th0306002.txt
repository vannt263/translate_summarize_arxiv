    "the calculation of hadronic form factors within the framework of poincar covariant quantum mechanics involves the following two separate ingredients : ( 1 ) bound - state wave functions , which represent vectors in the representation space of the little group of the poincar group , and ( 2 ) current operators that are covariant under a kinematic subgroup .",

    "point - form kinematics employs the full lorentz group as the kinematic subgroup . in this case the lorentz covariant spectator currents probe the velocity structure specified by the bound - state wave function .",
