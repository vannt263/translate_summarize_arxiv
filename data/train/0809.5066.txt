    "recently there has been much interest in solid - state approaches to the study of quantum information , light - matter interactions and cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed )  @xcite .",
    "there are many potential advantages to implementing quantum protocols on a semiconductor chip .",
    "the dipole coupling of matter to the field can be fixed because of the monolithic nature of the design . moreover , an integrated design can be naturally coupled to other on - chip devices , both photonic and electronic , and is inherently scalable .",
    "strong coupling experiments in solid - state cavity qed have evolved from the 1d geometry of quantum wells in a fabry perot microcavity  @xcite to full three - dimensionally confining micropillar and photonic crystal microcavities coupled to epitaxial quantum dots  @xcite .",
    "more recently , there have been a number of significant advances  @xcite in both photonic crystal cavities and microdisks .",
    "single nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) defect centers in diamond have recently emerged as promising candidates for quantum optics and quantum information  @xcite .",
    "they act as stable sources of single photons  @xcite , and at room temperature , they have electron spin coherence times of 350 @xmath7s  @xcite and nuclear spin coherence times of 0.5 ms .",
    "these spin states can be manipulated to form a quantum register  @xcite , and coupled with reasonable strength to optical transitions such as the zero - phonon line ( zpl ) , allowing the read - out of the state  @xcite .",
    "nv centers occur naturally in bulk diamond , but their spin states can dephase in the presence of proximate nitrogen spins .",
    "recently , techniques have been developed to artificially implant nv centers in high - purity single crystal diamond , which limits the density of substitutional nitrogen atoms and the associated sources of decoherence  @xcite .",
    "although much of this research relates to bulk diamond , nv centers embedded in 20 nm sized diamond nanocrystals ( ncs ) have also been shown to have spin coherence times on the order of microseconds  @xcite .",
    "embedding these diamond ncs in an optical microcavity could allow realization of the coherent light - matter interactions crucial for certain quantum protocols . with an appropriately designed cavity , for example ,",
    "this coherence could be controlled and entangled with photon states for transfer of the quantum information  @xcite .",
    "in fact , diamond ncs of about 75 nm in size have been strongly coupled to the whispering gallery modes of silica microspheres  @xcite .",
    "our goal is to design a wavelength - scale microcavity for coupling to diamond ncs on a planar platform , which would facilitate integration with other optical devices .",
    "a major challenge in realizing strongly - coupled diamond nv centers in this system is the fact that the zpl optical transition is in the visible ( 637 nm for the negatively charged nv@xmath8 center ) .",
    "a monolithic nanocavity must therefore be designed in a visibly transparent material .",
    "one option is diamond , which has a reasonably high refractive index @xmath9 , and optical resonators have been designed for thin slabs of diamond  @xcite with @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "experimentally this is very challenging , as the growth of single crystal diamond slabs has yet to be realized , and the polycrystalline films which are readily available suffer from large scattering losses which has limited the measured @xmath0 factors to less than 1000  @xcite . in bulk single crystal diamond",
    ", moreover , it is difficult to realize these structures due to the considerable challenge of creating three - dimensionally confining defect cavities .    for material systems operating in the visible ,",
    "an alternative to diamond is a wide bandgap semiconductor , such as silicon nitride , hafnium oxide , gallium nitride , or gallium phosphide  @xcite .",
    "silicon nitride and hafnium oxide are particularly promising candidates because of their compatibility with advanced silicon nanofabrication processes .",
    "indeed , sin@xmath4 microdisks have been fabricated with @xmath0 = 3.6 @xmath11 and mode volumes @xmath12(@xmath2)@xmath3  @xcite",
    ". the moderately low refractive index of @xmath13 2.0 of sin@xmath4 has often been considered an impediment to ultra - high-@xmath0 photonic crystal nanocavity designs , which thusfar have only been demonstrated in high index semiconductors such as silicon  @xcite . to wit ,",
    "the highest reported photonic crystal cavity design in sin@xmath4 has yielded a @xmath0 factor of 12,900 with a mode volume of 1.62 ( @xmath2)@xmath3  @xcite . in this paper , we demonstrate that silicon nitride photonic crystal nanocavities can have @xmath0 factors of 230,000 with mode volumes of @xmath13 0.55(@xmath2)@xmath3 . considering the relative ease of fabrication and the natural integration of our design as part of an on - chip ridge waveguide , this remarkably high @xmath14 ratio renders this device as a highly promising platform on which to pursue visible solid - state cavity qed .",
    "although we focus on silicon nitride , these results are applicable for any low - loss material with n @xmath13 2.0 .",
    "we first discuss our systematic approach to engineer the nanocavity , which is based on a series of publications by lalanne et al .",
    "we then consider the effect on the mode @xmath0 factor of a diamond nc embedded in the center of the cavity or positioned on top of the cavity surface , and demonstrate that a @xmath0 factor greater than 95% of the bare cavity @xmath0 is obtainable for a realistic nc size of 20 nm .",
    "for the case of the nc on top of the cavity , we explore the effect of spatial location of the nc with respect to the mode center , and evaluate the effect on the mode @xmath0 .",
    "we then evaluate the cavity qed figures of merit and show that when the nc is embedded in the center of the cavity , the system is capable of realizing the strong coupling limit .",
    "because of the relatively low index of refraction ( @xmath15 = 2.0 ) of sin@xmath4 , the two - dimensional photonic bandgap of sin@xmath4 planar photonic crystal slabs is small , particularly when measured against a high index semiconductor like silicon .",
    "this makes the design of nanocavities in 2d photonic lattices challenging  @xcite . to circumvent this difficulty",
    ", we consider a nanocavity for which the photonic lattice provides only one dimensional ( 1d ) confinement , and total internal reflection provides the confinement mechanism in the other two dimensions ( 2d ) . in these `` 1d + 2 '' structures ,",
    "the effective 1d bandgap , or stopband , is considerably larger than the corresponding 2d gap in a planar structure .",
    "for example , for the phc considered in this paper , the stop - band of the `` 1d + 2 '' structure spans 13% of the center frequency , whereas the `` 2d + 1 ''",
    "hexagonal planar photonic crystal with the same pitch and hole radius yields a 2d bandgap spanning just 7% of the center frequency .",
    "the wider 1d stopband allows a greater isolation of our defect mode from the band edges and therefore higher @xmath0 factors in engineered defect cavities .",
    "recently , a similar 1d design approach yielded a @xmath0 factor of @xmath16 in a high - index material ( @xmath17 )  @xcite .",
    "a sketch of the 1d nanocavity is shown in figure  [ fig:3dview ] , which also shows a 60 nm diamond nanocrystal positioned on top of the cavity .    .",
    "the taper and photonic crystal mirror sections are symmetric about the cavity center .",
    ", width=377 ]    the design process consists of engineering three elements : ( a ) the photonic crystal mirror , ( b ) the taper , and ( c ) the cavity length .",
    "we begin by considering a free - standing sin@xmath4 ridge waveguide of thickness 200 nm and width 300 nm which supports a single te mode .",
    "these parameters are chosen as representative of our experimental wafer , and have not been optimized in any fashion .",
    "the photonic crystal parameters , namely the hole spacing @xmath18 and radius @xmath19 , are chosen to center the resulting stop - band around the wavelength of interest ( @xmath13 637 nm ) .",
    "setting @xmath20 nm and @xmath21 gives a stopband over the wavelength band 593 - 679 nm , with a mid - gap wavelength of 636 nm , as required .",
    "we can characterize the reflectivity of the mirror using the 3d finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) method by launching a waveguide mode pulse and monitoring the reflection spectrum . the reflected light is spatially integrated over a plane perpendicular to the waveguide placed 300 nm in front of the mirror , and the loss spectrum , defined as l = 1 - r , is calculated .",
    "this spectrum quantifies the amount of light which is not reflected by the mirror and is lost due to transmission and scattering losses .    as shown by sauvan et al .",
    "@xcite , the scattering losses arise in part from the mode mismatch between the waveguide and bloch mirror modes . by tapering the mirror ,",
    "the discontinuity at the interface between the cavity and mirror can be smoothed , allowing for an adiabatic transition between the modes in the two regions .",
    "the mismatch can be quantified by comparing the effective index of the bloch mode , @xmath22 , to the effective index of the waveguide mode , @xmath23 ( determined using our 3d - fdtd mode solver  @xcite ) . to gradually taper into the waveguide mode ,",
    "the final segment of the mirror should support a bloch mode such that @xmath24 , which determines @xmath25 nm . for this to work , the @xmath26 ratio should be maintained close to that of the uniform mirror , which implies @xmath27 nm .",
    "thus , we wish to smoothly taper the photonic crystal parameters ( @xmath28 ) in the mirror from ( @xmath29 ) down to the values ( @xmath30 ) next to the cavity .",
    "in fact , we found an improvement by tapering the radius to a smaller value than this rule would suggest , from 70 nm to 55 nm .",
    "factors for the best nanocavities designed for each taper are ( 13,000 ; 22,900 ; 230,000 ) for the ( 2 ; 3 ; 4)-section tapers , respectively .",
    "the inset defines the hole pitch ( @xmath18 ) and radii ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the 4-hole taper parameters ( in nm ) are ( @xmath31 ) = ( 55 , 58 , 62 , 66 ) and ( @xmath32 ) = ( 214 , 226 , 238 , 250 ) .",
    ", width=377 ]    we gauge the efficacy of 2 , 3 , and 4 hole linear tapers according to the magnitude of @xmath33 , as plotted in figure  [ fig : refloss ] .",
    "the photonic crystal mirror is 17 periods in length , which was found to saturate the in - waveguide @xmath0 factor of the nanocavities based on these designs , as discussed below .",
    "each increase in the taper length has the effect of further reducing the mismatch between mirror and waveguide .",
    "the 4-hole taper yields a significantly improved reflectivity and hence lower loss , giving a minimum mirror loss @xmath34 .",
    "the nanocavity is defined by the gap @xmath35 between two taper / mirror sections , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3dview ] . in the 3d - fdtd simulation , the cavity",
    "is excited with several randomly phased and positioned dipole sources , and the @xmath0 factor is determined from the exponential decay of the electric field ringdown in the cavity .",
    "we also verified the @xmath0 factors by monitoring the power absorbed by the simulation boundaries , as discussed below , and these agree well with the ringdown values .",
    "to accurately model in a 3d - fdtd simulation the exact taper and cavity length dimensions to the scale of nanometers while maintaining tractable simulation times , we use a graded mesh approach .",
    "the mesh grid size is 5 nm in the central 0.4 @xmath36 0.4 @xmath36 0.4 @xmath7 m simulation volume . outside this region ,",
    "the mesh grid spacing is 10 nm for the dielectric waveguide ( corresponding to 25 points per photonic lattice spacing ) , and is nonlinearly graded with distance in free - space away from the dielectric material .",
    "we verified the convergence of the graded mesh simulation with a 5 nm grid uniformly meshed simulation .",
    "we consider cavities formed by the 4-segment tapered mirrors , which gave the highest reflectivity in the above analysis .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath0 factor on the nanocavity length @xmath35 is illustrated in figure  [ fig : qv ] .",
    "the maximum @xmath0 obtained is 230,000 for @xmath37 nm .",
    "this is nearly 20 times better than the highest value reported in the literature to date  @xcite . in these simulations , we have not considered material absorption , which was shown by barclay et al .",
    "@xcite to be a limiting factor in sin@xmath4 only for @xmath0 factors in the range of a few million , or scattering due to fabrication imperfections .",
    "further optimization may be possible by optimizing the waveguide width and thickness , as well as using different ( e.g. longer ) taper forms .     with a 4-hole taper and 17 period mirror . the cavity mode electric field @xmath38 distribution is shown . ,",

    "the cavity mode electric field @xmath38 distribution is shown .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=377 ]    the mode volume is plotted as the green trace in figure  [ fig : qv ] .",
    "the cavity with the maximum @xmath0 has a mode volume @xmath39 . despite the relatively low refractive index of sin@xmath4 , this is half the effective mode volume of the recent ultra - high-@xmath0 photonic crystal cavities designed in high index semiconductors  @xcite , demonstrating the highly attractive ultra - small size of these 1d nanocavities .    the mechanism which yields the high @xmath0 factor in the 4-hole tapered nanocavities is more subtle than a simple reduction of mirror loss compared to the shorter tapers .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : refloss ] , the loss of the 2-hole taper is improved by a factor of @xmath13 3 in the 4-hole taper , but the @xmath0 factor of the optimal cavity based on each design is increased by a factor of almost 20 . in a fabry - perot cavity , one would expect the @xmath0 factor to be proportional to the inverse loss .",
    "the difference here is that the cavity mode is derived from the propagating bloch modes of the photonic crystal mirror , and the local structural perturbation which forms the cavity introduces a mode gap  @xcite capable of supporting very high @xmath0 modes .",
    "recently , we used a similar approach to design cavities based on semiconductor nanowires with @xmath40  @xcite . the tapered transition from the mirror to the nanocavity",
    "not only reduces mirror loss in the simple fabry - perot picture , but reduces radiative loss arising from delocalization of the mode profile in @xmath41-space  @xcite .",
    "there may also be a role played by radiation modes in recycling the mirror losses and increasing the @xmath0 factor , as elaborated by lalanne et al . in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for a given structure",
    ", the @xmath0 factor can be separated into in - waveguide , @xmath42 , and perpendicular , @xmath43 components using the relation @xmath44 ( in analogy to the @xmath45 , @xmath43 division common in the analysis of 2d phc microcavities  @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath42 is calculated by measuring the power absorbed at the boundary of the simulation within one half - wavelength of the surface of the waveguide , @xmath46 , and then using the definition of the quality factor , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the electromagnetic energy in the resonant mode .",
    "@xmath43 is then determined from @xmath42 and the total @xmath49 .",
    "for a 17 period mirror , @xmath50 , indicating that the waveguide losses have saturated and the total losses are completely determined by out - of - waveguide loss . with a shorter photonic crystal mirror , the total @xmath0 drops as it is limited by in - waveguide losses . with 11 periods in the mirror , @xmath49 is reduced to about half the maximum value .",
    "this provides a guide for the design of an integrated in - waveguide emitter , in which light trapped or emitted into the nanocavity would couple predominantly into the waveguide mode rather than scattering off the ridge .",
    "this was the approach of zain et al .",
    "@xcite , who designed a @xmath51 period phc mirror in a silicon - on - insulator ridge waveguide and experimentally demonstrated a @xmath0 factor of 18,500 with a transmission of 85% .",
    "now that we have optimized our photonic crystal nanocavity design , we consider exploiting this nanocavity to enhance the zero - phonon line ( zpl ) emission from a nv center in a diamond nanocrystal .",
    "coupling the emission to the nanocavity mode will lead to a purcell enhancement of the spontaneous emission rate , and as we show below , the potential to realize quantum dynamics in the strong coupling regime .",
    "the ideal placement of the diamond nc is in the middle of the nanocavity , where the nv center can interact with the maximal electric field of the cavity mode .",
    "it is important to quantify the effect of the nc on the cavity @xmath0 factor . as in the bare ( unperturbed )",
    "cavity 3d - fdtd simulations , a 5 nm mesh is used in the central volume of the simulation in order to accurately model the effects of the small volume of diamond .",
    "we consider 20 nm and 40 nm sized cubic diamond ncs .",

    "increased_. in the best cavity ( @xmath35 = 95 nm ) , the bare @xmath0 factor of 230,000 increases to 240,000 with the 20 nm nc .",
    "these results perhaps reflect a trade - off between the beneficial impact of the increased refractive index in the cavity center , which would be expected to raise the @xmath0 factor , and the deleterious effect of changing the impedance matching condition used to design the mirror tapers . as expected with the higher index cavity core",
    ", there is a reduction of about 10% in the mode volume for all cavity lengths .",
    "we conducted a similar investigation for a 40 nm cubic diamond nc located at the cavity center , and found that the @xmath0 vs. @xmath35 curve shifts to shorter cavities compared to fig .",
    "[ fig : qv ] , yielding a peak @xmath52 at @xmath53 nm , with a mode volume of 0.50 ( @xmath2)@xmath3 .",
    "the main conclusion that can be drawn from this analysis is that the cavity @xmath0 factors are not changed by more than about 10% from the bare cavity values .",
    "the highest @xmath0 factor can still be achieved , and even slightly improved , and the mode volumes are slightly reduced .",
    "experimentally , an embedded nc might be realized by depositing a 100 nm layer of sin@xmath4 on a sacrificial layer of sio@xmath54 , placing a single diamond nc in a known position , and then depositing another 100 nm layer of sin@xmath4 to cap the structure and embed the nc in the middle .",
    "the nc position could be registered with respect to external alignment markers  @xcite , or the position might be revealed after the sin@xmath4 regrowth by a bump on the top surface  @xcite .",
    "the phc nanocavity would then be patterned around the nc , followed by removal of the sio@xmath54 .",
    "we simulated the scenario of a small 20 nm bump of sin@xmath4 on top of the cavity with an embedded 20 nm nc , and found a reduction of only about 2% in the @xmath0 factor of the best cavity .",

    "consider the emission enhancement of a dipole right at the semiconductor / air interface of a uniform slab 2d photonic crystal , and show that the rate can be enhanced by 5 - 10 times near the band edges . here",
    "we model a similar scenario , except the emitter is situated on the top surface of our sin@xmath4 nanocavity .",
    "the high @xmath14 ratio of our nanocavity presents the possibility to yield much higher emission enhancements , as elaborated below , with a maximum purcell factor of 1,800 for the nc on top , and 27,000 for the cavity with an embedded nc .",
    "we consider diamond nc cubes with 3 different edge lengths : 20 nm , 40 nm , and 60 nm , and consider the effect of such a nc placed exactly above the central anti - node of the nanocavity mode .",
