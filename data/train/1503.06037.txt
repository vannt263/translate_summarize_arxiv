    "in strange nuclear physics and hadron physics , kaonic nuclei ( nuclear system with anti - kaons , @xmath6 ) have been a hot topic because they are interestingly expected to have several exotic properties , such as the formation of dense state , due to strong @xmath1 attraction @xcite .",
    "to reveal such _ expected _ exotic properties involved in kaonic nuclei , we have focused on the simplest kaonic nucleus `` @xmath0 '' which is a prototype system of kaonic nuclei . in the experimental side , new results are being reported from j - parc experiments @xcite . especially , j - parc e27 collaboration has reported some signal in their @xmath0 search experiment using deuteron target @xcite . in the theoretical side ,",
    "the three - body system of @xmath0 has been investigated with various ways as summarized in ref .",
    "the binding energy and decay width rather depend on approaches and employed potentials .",
    "however , all theoretical studies result that the @xmath0 can be bound with less than 100 mev binding energy .",
    "since there is @xmath7 threshold at 103 mev below @xmath5 threshold , those calculations indicate that the @xmath0 should be a resonant state located between the two thresholds .",
    "in addition , it is known by studies of the @xmath8 that the @xmath1 couples strongly to the @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "thus , we consider that _ 1 .",
    "resonance _ and _ 2 .",
    "coupled - channel problem _ are key ingredients in the theoretical study of the @xmath0 .",
    "we , here , employ a coupled - channel complex scaling method ( cccsm ) since this approach can simultaneously treat these two ingredients .",
    "it should be noted that the complex scaling method has greatly succeeded in studies of resonant states of stable / unstable nuclei @xcite .",
    "we have applied the cccsm to the two - body system of @xmath1-@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "( @xmath11 means @xmath12 and @xmath13 hyperons . ) since the cccsm is found to be a useful tool also for the study of hadronic system through those studies , we now tackle the three - body system of @xmath0 with the same method .",
    "we briefly explain our method to investigate the @xmath0 resonance . here , note that the `` @xmath0 '' called in theoretical studies means a coupled - channel system of @xmath5-@xmath7-@xmath14 with quantum numbers of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "basically , we follow the usual prescription of the complex scaling method @xcite to calculate complex eigenvalues of the three - body system of @xmath0 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the @xmath0 is complex - scaled , with a complex - scaling operator @xmath15 in which the coordinate and the conjugate momentum are transformed as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . diagonalizing the complex - scaled hamiltonian with a @xmath18-integrable basis functions , which are the correlated gaussian functions @xcite in our study",
    ", complex eigenvalues are obtained . among those eigenvalues , the eigenvalues which are independent of the scaling angle @xmath19",
    "correspond to the resonant states .",
    "the @xmath0 is a coupled - channel system of @xmath5 , @xmath7 and @xmath14 .",
    "we treat such a multi - channel problem as a single - channel problem with help of feshbach method @xcite in the complex scaling method .",
    "we call our method as a coupled - channel complex scaling method with feshbach projection ( _ cccsm+feshbach method _ ) @xcite .    in feshbach method , a model space ( @xmath20 space ) and outer space of the model space ( @xmath21 space ) are assigned .",
    "then , the schrdiner equation is given as a coupled - channel equation of wave functions for @xmath20 and @xmath21 spaces . by the elimination the @xmath21-space wave function , a schrdiner equation only for the @xmath20-space wave function @xmath22",
    "is obtained as @xmath23 \\phi_p = e \\phi_p$ ] .",
    "( the operator @xmath24 is a kinetic - energy operator for the @xmath20 space . ) here , the effective potential for @xmath20 space , @xmath25 , is formally written as @xmath26 with @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the green function for the @xmath21 space and \\{@xmath29 } indicates the coupled - channel potential for the @xmath20 and @xmath21 spaces with @xmath30=@xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "certainly , a single - channel schrdiner equation for the @xmath20 space can be obtained with the feshbach method .",
    "however , the problem is how to represent the @xmath28 in actual calculations .",
    "we overcome this matter with a unique nature of the complex scaling method .",
    "the closure relation is proven to hold also in the csm , including resonant states explicitly as well as bound and non - resonant continuum states .",
    "( _ extended closure relation _ , ecr @xcite ) .",
    "the ecr is known to be well described approximately with a set of finite number of the eigenstates \\{@xmath31 } which are obtained by the diagonalization of a complex - scaled hamiltonian @xmath32 with a gaussian basis function ; @xmath33 @xcite .    with help of the ecr",
    ", the complex - scaled green function @xmath34 is expressed as @xmath35 where the energy eigenvalue @xmath36 and eigenstate @xmath37 are obtained by the diagonalization of the complex - scaled hamiltonian @xmath38 with gaussian basis functions . since the non - scaled green function for the @xmath21 space is obtained from the complex - scaled green function @xmath39 by such an inverse transformation as @xmath40 , the effective potential for the @xmath20 space is @xmath41 since the @xmath39 given as eq .",
    "( [ gq_th ] ) is represented with gaussian functions , the effective potential @xmath25 is also composed of gaussian functions .",
    "therefore , it can be used as usual in the complex scaling method with gaussian basis function .",
    "we apply this technique to the calculation of the @xmath0 system . setting the @xmath1 channel as @xmath20 space and the @xmath9 and @xmath42 channels as @xmath21 space",
    ", we construct an effective @xmath1 potential @xmath43 . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath10 channels are eliminated at the step of two - body calculation .",
    "the @xmath43 plugged in the three - body hamiltonian of the @xmath5 , we solve the single - channel problem of the @xmath5 system with the complex scaling method .      the effective @xmath1 potential derived with the cccsm+feshbach method",
    "has an energy dependence .",
    "the self - consistency for @xmath1 energy has to be taken into account when bound and resonant states are considered .",
    "such a self - consistency is dealt with a manner proposed in an earlier study @xcite : the definition of the @xmath1 energy in the @xmath0 is non - trivial because the two - body @xmath1 system is a subsystem of the three - body @xmath5 system .",
    "we define the @xmath1 energy ( @xmath44 ) in two ways by considering extreme two pictures ; the anti - kaon is regarded as a field ( ansatz 1 ) or it is considered as a particle ( ansatz 2 ) .",
    "details of calculation of the @xmath44 are given in eqs .",
    "( 20 ) and ( 21 ) in ref . @xcite .",
    "also in the present study , these two ansatz are examined .",
    "we remark that this self - consistency is realized for the _ complex _",

    "first , we consider the case where the @xmath1 energy in the energy - dependent @xmath1 potential is fixed to that for the @xmath8 .",
    "in other words , the @xmath1 energy is not self - consistent in the @xmath0 , but it is self - consistent for the isolated two - body system of @xmath1-@xmath9 which forms the @xmath8 resonance . the distribution of obtained complex - energy eigenvalues is shown in the left panel of fig . [ fig1 ] . in the figure",
    ", the origin of the real energy axis corresponds to the @xmath5 three - body threshold .",
    "it is known that in the complex scaling method the continuum states appear on so - called @xmath48 line ( @xmath49 ) when the scaling angle is @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the eigenvalues along the @xmath48 line running from the origin indicate the scattering continuum states of @xmath5 three - body system",
    ". there are eigenvalues on the other line .",
    "the starting point of this line is ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) mev which is nearly equal to the complex energy of the @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "( @xmath45 denotes the higher pole of the @xmath8 . )",
    "therefore , the eigenvalues on the second line indicate the @xmath52 two - body scattering continuum states .",
    "there is a complex eigenvalue isolated from the two lines mentioned above , as marked with a red circle in the figure .",
    "this eigenstate means the @xmath0 resonance . in the case where the @xmath1 energy is fixed at that of the @xmath45 , the pole energy of the @xmath0 resonance",
    "is found to be @xmath53 mev .",
    "next , we take into account the self - consistency for the @xmath1 energy in the three - body system @xmath0 , following the two ansatz as explained in the section [ e - dep ] . as a result of the search for self - consistent solutions ,",
    "such solutions of the @xmath0 resonance have been successfully found .",
    "the resonance energy is obtained to be @xmath54 mev for ansatz 1 and ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) mev for ansatz 2 .",
    "the binding energy @xmath57 is not so dependent on the ansatz , whereas the decay width @xmath58 strongly depends on it .",
    "compared with the earlier work of the variational calculation with a chiral su(3)-based potential @xcite that is a similar type to the potential used here , the present calculation gives slightly deeper binding and narrower width .",
    "we examine the @xmath46 dependence of the solutions , since the @xmath46 value is a parameter of our @xmath1 potential .",
    "the resonance pole of the @xmath0 system is found for each @xmath46 value when it is varied from 90 mev to 120 mev .",
    "( see the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . )",
    "however , since we find that the pole for @xmath59 mev in ansatz 1 is unstable for the scaling angle @xmath19 , we discard this solution .",
    "consequently , the binding energy is obtained to be small , 20 - 30 mev .",
    "the decay width is obtained to spread widely , 20 - 65 mev .",
    "we comment on the present result .",
    "it is found that both ansatz give similar binding energy .",
    "however , they give rather different decay width ; ansatz 1 tends to give extremely small decay width , compared to ansatz 2 .",
    "the ansatz 2 seems to provide the decay width similar to that of the earlier study @xcite .",
    "complex eigenvalue distribution of @xmath5 with @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "av4 @xmath60 and a phenomenological @xmath1 potentials are employed .",
    "`` k@xmath61-d '' means the scattering continuum states of @xmath62 and deuteron . ]    as mentioned in introduction , recently j - parc e27 collaboration has reported their experimental result of @xmath0 search via @xmath63 reaction @xcite .",
    "we consider that this reaction excites @xmath4 state , not @xmath2 state of the @xmath0 that we have calculated so far , since the target of deuteron is spin 1 state and the @xmath64 reaction is expected not to flip the spin so much @xcite .",
    "hence , we have investigated a @xmath5 system with the quantum numbers of @xmath4 and @xmath3 in the same way as mentioned above . here , we set the spin and isospin of two nucleons to be @xmath65 and @xmath66 in the trial wave function of @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "we employ the av4 @xmath60 potential in which the tensor force is incorporated into the central force , and an energy - independent phenomenological @xmath1 potential @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 energy in the effective @xmath1 potential is fixed to be that of @xmath45 resonance for the simplicity .",
    "[ fig_s=1 ] shows the complex eigenvalue distribution obtained with the cccsm+feshbach method . as marked in the figure",

    "a coupled - channel problem is reduced to a single - channel problem to be handled more easily , by utilizing the extended closure relation in the complex scaling method . as a result of the search for the @xmath0 resonance pole on the complex energy plane ,",
    "the binding energy and the mesonic decay width of @xmath0 are obtained to be 20 - 30 mev and 20 - 65 mev , respectively , where we use an energy - dependent chiral su(3)-based @xmath1 potential .",
    "we consider that the @xmath0 is shallowly bound as suggested by earlier studies with variational methods using the same kinds of @xmath1 potentials @xcite .",
    "according to the recent report of j - parc e27 collaboration , a bump structure is found at @xmath69 mev in the @xmath70 invariant - mass spectrum with two protons tagged @xcite .",
    "this means that the binding energy is about @xmath71 mev similarly to the results of the past two experiments @xcite , _ if the observed state is a @xmath0 state_. if this is the case , there are large discrepancy between experimental observations and theoretical results . in addition",
    ", there has been still an essential question  `` what is the object observed in the experiments ? '' . to resolve these questions , further studies from both experimental and theoretical sides are necessary . in our future plan",
