    "chiral specificity of the bioorganic world is one of the most intriguing phenomenon of nature @xcite . it is often thought to reflect mirror breaking responsible for a life with a given ` sign of chirality ' , in the absence of any evidence of ` mirror - antipode ' life @xcite .",
    "physical origins of this symmetry breaking are not completely understood yet . along with spontaneous symmetry breaking studies , understanding that optical methods , specifically methods of nonlinear optics @xcite , could be used not just to monitor , but also to control chiral symmetry of molecules seems to be of great importance .    in this paper",
    "we investigate a possibility of excitation of the chiral - asymmetric states of the hydrogen peroxide molecule ( h@xmath0o@xmath0 ) driven by a laser pulse parameters of which ( duration and laser field intensity ) fit special requirements discussed in the paper .",
    "hydrogen peroxide molecule ( fig . [ fig1]a ) is a simplest chiral molecule geometry of which is non - invariant with respect to the coordinate inversion transformation @xmath1 .",
    "when this transformation is applied the mirror - image of the molecule can not be mapped with the original with the help of any rotation transformation because the torsional angles of the molecule @xmath2 are not equivalent .",
    "when we select between left- or right - handed frame , a choice of the direction of the vector @xmath3 from one atom to another allows us then to assign a definite sign to the torsional angle @xmath4hooh .",
    "an equilibrium value of the torsional angle in the gas phase in accordance with theoretical calculations and experimental data is @xmath5 @xcite , where positive sign corresponds to the shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a so - called @xmath6-state ( right - handed enantiomer ) and negative  to the @xmath7-state ( left - handed enantiomer ) .",
    "a rough understanding of the effect of photoinduced switching between left- and right - handed enantiomers of @xmath8 molecule may be obtained as follows .",
    "this molecule has a characteristic double well torsional potential shape .",
    "existence of the mirror symmetry of the minima of the torsional potential leads to the splitting of energy states as a result of tunneling through the lower barrier .",
    "the resulting eigen states being presented with the even and odd wave functions @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( tunneling through the higher barrier and the corresponding additional splitting are negligible @xcite ) . relatively large splitting value @xmath11 @xmath12 corresponds to the absence of stationary chiral - asymmetric states , which actually oscillate with the frequency @xmath13 between the stationary states @xmath14 @xmath10 until the symmetric equilibrium is reached . as a result",
    ", one can manipulate the chiral properties of @xmath8 molecule inducing tunneling between @xmath6- and @xmath7-enantiomers and therefore the effect of photoinduced optical rotation has an oscillating character .",

    "@xmath23 of the @xmath24 transition we get @xmath25    this means that the precession between the tunneling splitted right and left chiral states ( @xmath26 ) can be excited only due to the quadrupole interaction , whereas the dipole interaction causes only modulation of the eigen states energies , oscillating with the frequency of the exciting laser field . in other words , we can _ selectively _ excite due to the quadrupole interaction @xmath6- or @xmath7-enantiomers using one of the most fundamental quantum optics effects  coherent precession of a two - level system under the action of a coherent pulse of electromagnetic field .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the conditions under which the effect of photo - induced chirality can be studied experimentally by registering the corresponding photoinduced optical activity in a racemic mixture of left- and right - handed enantiomers of the h@xmath0o@xmath0 molecule , which shows no optical activity otherwise .",

    "the criterion of alignment of the molecules dipole moments along @xmath27 axis for 100% of the molecules in a solution under the action of dc electric field with the magnitude @xmath28 can be written as @xmath29 ( @xmath30 is the o ",

    "if we do not require that 100% of the molecules in the solution are to be aligned , we can then use relatively moderate field intensities and therefore achieve a smaller degree of alignment @xmath33 , which however may be enough to determine experimentally optical activity in the initially racemic solution .    in the frequency region of electronic susceptibility , the effect can be estimated to the lowest order under the suggestion that @xmath34 represents the part of molecules aligned strictly along the field , whereas the rest of the molecules do not contribute to the effect . then the upper estimate can be obtained by multiplying the typical specific rotation value @xmath35 deg@xmath36@xmath37/g@xmath36 dm for the media with strong optical activity by the small parameter @xmath34 , which gives us finally @xmath38 deg@xmath36@xmath37/g@xmath36 dm for the resonantly excited optical activity at @xmath39  v / cm . for a vapor at normal conditions and at the interaction length of 1  dm the rotation angle is about @xmath40 .",
    "this value is about the sensitivity limit of the linear polarization spectroscopy methods .",
    "therefore , even without going into other obstacles , it seems difficult to observe the effect of photoinduced optical rotation in the scheme with one - photon resonant excitation and using dc electric field for aligning the molecules .",
    "additional trouble is the finite lifetime @xmath41 of the chiral state due to the molecular collisions in a solution .",

    "two - photon raman excitation scheme we discuss in this paper fits the above condition and , beyond that , provides an effective excitation of the required chiral state of the molecule using lasers in the convenient frequency range .",
    "to describe free molecule s dynamics driven by the laser field we shall start with the mathematical description of free molecule s dynamics . for this",
    "it seems helpful to reduce the total molecular hamiltonian using the fact that proton to oxygen mass ratio is a small one .",
    "then the protons dynamics can be treated adiabatically with respect to the oxygen coordinates so that the dynamics of oxygen nuclei can be calculated by averaging over direction of the unit vector @xmath50 along the o  o bond .",
    "averaging along @xmath27-coordinate ( fig .",

    "this , however , does not change the effect by order of magnitude in contrast to the method of electrostatic orientation . to avoid interference of the probe field with the frequency @xmath199 with the registered at the same frequency effect in the pump field ,",
    "the beams could be slightly crossed in the sample at the angle small enough not to affect the field distribution in the active region .",
    "in conclusion , an attempt was made to answer a question : how methods of nonlinear optics can be used to induce a required sign of chirality in a racemic mixture of enantiomers of a chiral molecule ?",
    "we consider a racemic mixture of left- and right - handed enantiomers of hydrogen peroxide molecule .",
    "torsional potential of this molecule has a characteristic double - well shape minima of which correspond to the left- and right - handed enantiomers and are mirror - symmetrically spaced . as a result , a splitting of eigenstates of the torsional hamiltonian arises from tunneling through the potential energy barrier separating the two wells . for h@xmath0o@xmath0 molecule",
    "this tunneling splitting is 11.4 cm-1 and 116.34 cm-1 for the internal rotation ground and first excited states , respectively , so that the the molecule shows rapid oscillations between left- and right - handed enantiomers . in a vapor or in a solution situation",
    "is complicated due to the averaging over ensemble .",
    "analysis of molecule - electromagnetic field interaction shows that dipole interaction does not contribute to the left - right conversion process ( this interaction we can use for orientation of dipole moments of molecules in the mixture ) , but the quadrupole interaction , which leads to the excitation of coherent precession between left- and right - handed enantiomers states .",
    "this gives us a tool for controlling the chiral symmetry of the molecule .",
    "we show that biharmonic raman excitation of the splitted internal rotation levels can be effectively used for inducing optical activity in an initially racemic mixture of left- and right - handed enantiomers of h@xmath0o@xmath0 molecules .",
    "an experiment to study this photoinduced optical rotation in h@xmath0o@xmath0 vapor is proposed .",
