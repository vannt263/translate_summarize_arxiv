    "entropic contributions to the solution thermodynamics may reflect multiple configurations that occur .",
    "thus information on the conformers present should assist in accurately describing temperature variations of solvation properties .",
    "in addition , theoretical study of the molecular structure of the species participating these reactions should teach us about the molecular mechanisms involved and provide a benchmark of current theoretical tools for modeling speciation of metal ions in groundwaters@xcite .",
    "the condition of ferrous and ferric ions in solution has long been of specific interest to explanations of electron exchange processes @xcite .",
    "the hydrolysis product fe(h@xmath0o)@xmath3oh@xmath4 often contributes significantly to the rate of ferric ion reduction in water because the specific rate constant for ferric - ferrous electron exchange is about a thousand times larger for the hydrolyzed compared to unhydrolyzed hexaaquoferric ion @xcite .",
    "the net standard free energy change ( about 3  kcal / mol@xcite ) for the first hydrolysis reaction , @xmath9 is small compared to the size of the various contributions that must be considered in theoretical modeling of these solution species .",
    "in contrast to the great volume of work on electron transfer involving such species , reactions of particular interest here transfer a proton from a water ligated to a fe@xmath2 ion to a free water molecule .",
    "the second hydrolysis , @xmath10 raises more seriously the possibility of participation by several isomers in the mechanism and thermodynamics of these reactions .",
    "this work takes ferric ion hydrolysis as a demonstration system for determination of the utility of current theoretical tools for modeling of speciation of metal ions in aqueous solution . at this stage",
    "we have not considered multiple metal center aggregates .",
    "we report below encouraging agreement with experimental thermochemistries but with unexpected results that must be addressed for further progress in describing these chemical systems in molecular terms .",
    "the physical idea of treating an inner solvation shell on a different footing from the rest of the solvent has considerable precedent@xcite .",
    "friedman and krishnan referred to these approaches as _ hybrid models _ and criticized them on the grounds that individual contributions to the thermodynamic properties of final interest could not be determined with sufficient accuracy to draw new conclusions from the final results .",
    "however , particularly for highly charged and chemically complex ions , the hybrid approaches seem indispensable @xcite .",
    "computational and conceptual progress in the 25 years since that friedman - krishnan review has made these approaches interesting once again . in what follows ,",
    "we first elaborate on the calculational techniques used .",
    "an appendix discusses some of the statistical thermodynamic issues underlying these hybrid models .",
    "reliable estimation of free energies of dissociation in aqueous media requires a similarly reliable determination of the process in the gas phase .",
    "given the well known difficulties associated with electron correlation in transition metal complexes , and our intent to extend this work to larger and more complex systems , we chose to explore this problem with the b3lyp hybrid density functional theory ( dft)@xcite . this approximation is an effective compromise between accuracy and computational expense , and has been shown to give usefully accurate predictions of metal - ligand bond energies in a number of molecules@xcite . in the present application",
    "however , we were less interested in the metal - ligand bond energy than in the energies for successive elimination of protons from the h@xmath0o ligands bound to fe@xmath2",
    ". this may be a somewhat less severe test of the functional .",
    "the details of our approach and estimates of the errors follow .",
    "the geometry and vibrational frequencies of the metal complex were determined using the 6 - 311+g basis set for the metal ion and the 6 - 31 g * basis set for the ligands@xcite .",
    "the former is contracted from wachters@xcite primitive gaussian basis ( including the functions describing the 4s and 4p atomic orbitals ) and augmented with the diffuse d - function of hay@xcite .",
    "the ligand basis set contains a polarization function of d - character on the oxygen . at the optimum geometry ,",
    "a single calculation was done to determine the energy in a more extended basis ( 6 - 31++g * * ) that includes polarization and diffuse functions on both the oxygen and hydrogen centers .",
    "atomic charges were determined in this extended basis as well using the chelpg@xcite capability ( r@xmath11=2.02 ) in the gaussian94 package@xcite .",
    "all fe species are high - spin ( d@xmath12 ) treated in the spin - unrestricted formalism .",
    "one might argue , on the basis of the oh@xmath13 character expected in the product complexes , that the geometry optimization should also be done with a diffuse basis set for the ligands .",
    "this was found unnecessary by explicit calculations on the partial reaction @xmath14 the endothermicity of this reaction computed from a single point calculation with the 6 - 31+g * basis at its optimum geometry differs by only 0.2  kcal / mole from the result obtained with the smaller basis .",
    "more important are additional polarization and diffuse functions on the hydrogens ; for example , neglecting zero - point corrections , the b3lyp endothermicities are 29.2  kcal / mole(6 - 31 g * ) , 25.4  kcal / mole(6 - 31+g * ) , and 28.1  kcal / mole(6 - 31++g * * ) .",
    "a final consideration regarding basis set convergence is the importance of polarization ( f - functions ) on the metal center .",
    "this was examined by augmenting the 6 - 311+g fe basis with two f - functions ( @xmath15 = 0.25,0.75 ) split about a value ( @xmath15 = 0.4 ) optimized for fe(h@xmath0o)@xmath1@xmath2 . in this larger basis",
    "an endothermicity of 27.9  kcal / mole results compared to the value 28.1  kcal / mole obtained without the f - functions .",
    "the correction to the second hydrolysis is only slightly larger , @xmath16 0.5  kcal / mole .",
    "we thus conclude that the b3lyp deprotonation energies are nearly converged with respect to further improvements in the basis set .",
    "a conservative estimate might be associated with the change observed between the 6 - 311+g/6 - 31+g * results and the 6 - 311+g(2f)/6 - 31++g * * results , or about 2 - 3  kcal / mole .",
    "convergence of the results with respect to basis set does not address the accuracy expected with the b3lyp method .",
    "in so far as the water molecules retain their identity when bound to the metal ion , we expect the error in the hydrolysis reaction to be approximated by the error observed for the analogous reaction for a single h@xmath0o molecule .",
    "the procedure outlined above was therefore used to determine the energies and zero - point energies ( zpe ) for a number of species associated with the neutral and ionic dissociation channels of h@xmath0o .",
    "they are reported in table  [ t_0 ] , and can be used to determine the properties and reaction energies reported in table  [ t_1 ] .",
    "the h@xmath0o thermochemistries shown there are in excellent agreement with experiment . for example , the error associated with the reaction @xmath17 is underestimated by less than 2  kcal / mole .",
    "the errors in the other dissociation channels are similar .",
    "electrostatic interactions of hydrated ferric ions with the aqueous environment are expected to be of first importance in this solution chemistry .",
    "these hydrolysis reactions are written so that other contributions to the net free energy , _ e.g. _ packing , might balance reasonably .",
    "thus , continuum dielectric solvation modeling is a reasonable approach to studying these solution processes ; it is physical , computationally feasible , and can provide a basis for more molecular theory .",
    "the dielectric model produces an approximation to the interaction part of the chemical potential , @xmath18 of the solute ; in notation used below @xmath19 where for this case @xmath20 is the solute - solvent electrostatic interaction potential energy and the brackets indicate the average over the thermal motion of the solvent uninfluenced by the charge distribution of the solute .",
    "free energy contributions due to non - electrostatic interactions are neglected .",
    "we address free energy changes due to atomic motions internal to the complexes on the basis of gas phase determinations of the vibrational frequencies and partition functions .",
    "the solvation calculation treats all species as rigid ; we comment later on the consequences of this approximation and on the possibilities for relaxing it .",
    "the solute molecular surface was the boundary between volume enclosed by spheres centered on all atoms and the exterior .",
    "the sphere radii were those determined empirically by stefanovich @xcite , except r@xmath11=2.08  for the ferric ion .",
    "the ferric ion is well buried by the ligands of these complexes and slight variations of this latter value were found to be unimportant .",
    "the numerical solutions of the poisson equation were produced with a boundary integral procedure as sketched in references @xcite typically employing approximately 16k boundary elements .",
    "the accuracy of the numerical solution of the dielectric model is expected to be better than a kcal / mol for the electrostatic solvation free energy .",
    "the pertinent energies for fe(h@xmath0o)@xmath1@xmath2 and other species involved in hydrolysis processes are compiled in tables [ t_0 ] and [ t_1 ] .",
    "the magnitudes of the various components entering into the gas phase hydrolysis free energy are reported in table  [ t_1a ] , while table  [ t_1b ] adds the solvation contributions to the free energy and compares the total with experiment .",
    "table  [ t_2 ] summarizes geometrical information and partial atomic charges computed from the electrostatic potential fit are presented in table  [ t_3 ] .",
    "the structure of the fe(h@xmath0o)@xmath1@xmath2 complex , t@xmath21 symmetry , is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the b3lyp approximation gives an fe - o distance of 2.061  . by way of comparison , with the identical basis set",
    "the hartree - fock approximation yields 2.066  .",
    "these distances are similar to the recent hartree - fock results of kesson , _ et al._@xcite , r@xmath22 = 2.062  , and the gradient - corrected dft(bpw86 ) calculations of li , _ et al._@xcite , r@xmath22= 2.067  .",
    "these theory values cluster in the upper end of the range of distances ( 1.97   2.05  ) determined experimentally@xcite .",
    "neutron scattering measurements report 2.01  in concentrated electrolyte solutions @xcite .",
    "the solution exafs result ( 1.98  ) is close to the crystallographic determinations , 1.97   2.00  @xcite . in their recent review ,",
    "ohtaki and radnai discuss a number of other experiments and conclude the distance lies in the range of 2.01  2.05  @xcite .",
    "though these theory values are compatible with the upper end of this range , they are far from the exafs result ( 1.98  ) that might be the most reliable experimental determination . while investigating this question , we found that the b3lyp value is stable with respect to further improvements in the basis ; if the basis is augmented with an f - function on the metal and diffuse functions on the oxygens , the equilibrium distance decreases only slightly ( r@xmath23 = 2.053  ) . as noted above , the b3lyp result is in close agreement with that from the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "it would not be surprising , however , if the hf approximation overestimated the bond length .",
    "akesson , _ et al._@xcite have previously observed that the hf bond lengths for a series of first row transition metal hydrates are systematically too long .",
    "they find that correlation effects and the influence of the second hydration shell each act to reduce the bond length by about 0.01  . even with these corrections",
    "the theoretical bond length is still much larger than 1.98  . as an additional data point , the local - density - approximation with the present basis yields r@xmath23 = 2.013  , in better agreement with the exafs and crystallographic determinations .",
    "however , while the lda generally gives reasonable geometries for transition metal complexes@xcite , sosa , _ et al._@xcite find that it tends to underestimate the lengths of dative bonds , such as the one discussed here , and this might further support a bond length toward the upper end of the range .",
    "the atomic partial charges computed here for the hexaaquoferric ion are given in table  [ t_3 ] .",
    "note that the charge assigned to the ferric ion is substantially less than 3e , and that the magnitudes of the charges on the oxygen and hydrogen atoms are substantially greater than is common with effective force fields used for simulation of liquid water .",
    "as discussed in the appendix , a value for the absolute free energy of the ferric ion can be obtained from a free energy of formation of the fe(h@xmath0o)@xmath1@xmath2 complex from an isolated fe@xmath2 ( @xmath24 ) ion and six water molecules ( table  [ t_1a ] ) , provided that no solvation contribution is included for the atomic ion and that the actual , not standard state , species concentrations are used . that absolute free energy in aqueous solution is -1020  kcal / mol .",
    "experimental values range from -1037  kcal / mol to -1019  kcal / mol @xcite .",
    "we note that this theoretical value takes no account of solvation effects due to non - electrostatic interactions .",
    "this agreement with experiment is encouraging . in computing the absolute free energy",
    "there are a number of large contributions to the final result .",
    "this contrasts to the hydrolysis reactions where we have arranged things to encourage cancellation of errors .",
    "it is interesting to examine the components contributing to the free energy in the gas phase ( table  [ t_1a ] ) .",
    "not surprisingly , the zero - point correction , + 15  kcal / mole , is significant . under the standard conditions , hypothetical p=1  atm ideal gas with t=298.15  k",
    ", there is the large , unfavorable differential entropy contribution , + 47  kcal / mole .",
    "this arises from the necessity of sequestering six water molecules in a dilute gas .",
    "the net free energy found for the gas phase reaction is -602  kcal / mole",
    ". table  [ t_1b ] addresses the solution phase aspects of this thermochemistry .",
    "( see the appendix also . ) about half of the ideal entropy penalty mentioned is regained in the liquid because of the higher concentration of water molecules .",
    "the differential solvation free energy adds another -391  kcal / mole of ( favorable ) free energy for a net absolute free energy of hydration of -1020  kcal / mole .",
    "this estimate of the absolute free energy of the ferric ion is close to the value -1037  kcal / mole reported by li , _ et al . _ @xcite as a hydration _ enthalpy . _",
    "the li , _ et al .",
    ", _ value contains some terms that would be appropriate if the hydration enthalpy were sought and some terms that would contribute to the hydration free energy ; thus comparison of that previous value with the present result is not straightforward . in fact , the most pragmatic calculation of the hydration enthalpy within the dielectric continuum model is nontrivial .",
    "the enthalpy would be then obtained by determining a temperature derivative of the chemical potential . the appropriate temperature derivative determines the enthalpy directly or , alternatively , the solvation entropy so that the desired enthalpy might be determined by differencing with the already known chemical potential . that temperature derivative would generally involve also the temperature variation of the radii - parameters@xcite .",
    "the variations with thermodynamic state of the radii - parameters have not been well studied@xcite .",
    "there is good agreement , however , in many of the components contributing to this hydration enthalpy .",
    "_ report a gas phase energy of formation of -652.2  kcal / mole with the bpw86 gradient - corrected functional compared to the present b3lyp result of -655.2  kcal / mole , and their solvation free energy is -444  kcal / mole _ vs. _ the -441  kcal / mole found here .",
    "such close agreement is encouraging , although somewhat fortuitous .",
    "our gas phase energy of formation includes a correction , not considered by li , _ et al .",
    ", _ of some 15  kcal / mole for the zero - point energies .",
    "it is encouraging , however , that the estimates disagree by only about 15  kcal / mole , or some 1.5% . additionally , the definition of the molecular surface adopted by li , _ et al .",
    ", _ for the solvation calculation was substantially different from that used here , as were the radii - parameters used .",
    "we turn now to the first deprotonation reaction eq .",
    "[ eq : hydro1 ] .",
    "the structure found for fe(h@xmath0o)@xmath3oh@xmath4 is displayed in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the fe - o ( hydroxide ) distance is 1.76  and the fe - o ( water ) distances lengthen to 2.10   2.15  .",
    "assembling the results for the standard free energy of this reaction we find 2  kcal / mol , in surprisingly good agreement with the experimental value of 3  kcal / mol@xcite .",
    "this computed net free energy change is composed of approximately -148  kcal / mol exothermic ( favorable ) change in isolated molecule free energy and + 150  kcal / mol ( unfavorable ) net increase in solvation free energy .",
    "the solvation contribution favors the reactant side here because it presents the most highly charged ion .",
    "changes in the radius assigned to the iron atom in the range 2.06  @xmath25r@xmath262.10  lead to changes of @xmath27 1  kcal / mol in the predicted reaction free energy . this reaction was also considered by li , _",
    "et al.,_@xcite who find it to be exothermic by 14  kcal / mole .    to treat the next hydrolysis eq .",
    "[ eq : hydro2 ] we must consider fe(h@xmath0o)@xmath5(oh)@xmath0@xmath28 species . figure  [ fig3 ] shows the stable structures found .",
    "further lengthening of both the fe - o(water ) and fe - o(hydroxide ) distances is noted(table  [ t_2 ] ) in the _ cis _ and _ trans _ six - coordinate species by 0.07 - 0.14  compared to the fe(h@xmath0o)@xmath3oh@xmath4 . in the gas phase , the _ cis _ structure is predicted to be the lowest energy conformer , slightly ( 1  kcal / mole ) below the _ trans _ isomer .",
    "this preference is reversed in solution , where the _ trans _ isomer is predicted to be slightly more stable .",
    "we note that the most current force fields applied to simulation of ferric ions in solution place the _ cis _ structure significantly higher in energy than the _",
    "trans_@xcite .",
    "we were surprised to discover a stable _ outer _ sphere complex during our search for the stable _ trans _ structure .",
    "the structure is given in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the distances between the hydroxyl oxygens and the outer sphere water are typical of hydrogen bonds .",
    "explicit calculation of the vibrational frequencies show it to be a true local minimum , lying less than a kcal / mol higher in energy than the _ cis _ conformer",
    ".    the interaction of the outer sphere water with the remainder of the ferric hydrate complex can be partially characterized by finding the energy of that complex without the outer sphere partner .",
    "the structure obtained for that penta - coordinate ferric ion is shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the penta - coordinate complex can stably adopt a conformation similar to that of figure  [ fig3 ] also in the absence of the outer sphere water . in terms of the zero - point corrected electronic energy , this _",
    "sphere complex is stable with respect to loss of the h@xmath0o by about 7  kcal / mole .",
    "consideration of the entropic contributions to the free energy find the complex still stable with respect to loss of h@xmath0o , but the differential solvation contributions reverse this conclusion .",
    "thus , the dissociation of the outer sphere complex is an essentially thermoneutral process .",
    "we suspect such intermediates play an important role in the mechanism of the ligand exchange with the solvent .",
    "these three conformers lead to estimates of 16  kcal / mol , 16  kcal / mol , and 18  kcal / mol for the reaction free energy of the second hydrolysis for _ trans , outer , _ and _ cis sphere _",
    "products , respectively ; the experimental value is approximately 5  kcal / mol@xcite .",
    "we note that as in the case of the first hydrolysis , the gas phase predictions lead to an exothermic reaction ; it is the differential solvation free energy that tips the scales in favor of endothermicity .",
    "the issue of the internal motions of the complexes , and the near degeneracy of several conformers , raises also the issue of conformational entropy of these species .",
    "for example , in the second hydrolysis reaction , factors such as -rt@xmath29 arise if the three isomers discussed here are considered isoenergetic .",
    "[ however , the multiplicity of isoenergetic states will surely not be just 3 and , furthermore , entropy _ differences _ are required here . ] as another example , the t@xmath21 hexaaquo complex surely has a number of low - lying structures involving the rotation of the plane of an individual h@xmath0o .",
    "more generally , this conformational entropy would be appropriately included by computing the solvation contribution to the chemical potential , @xmath30 , of the complex according to @xmath31 where the sum indicated is over conformations @xmath32 weighted by the normalized population , the mole fractions @xmath33 of conformers when there is no interaction between solute and solvent , and further the summand is the boltzmann factor of the solvation free energies , perhaps from a physical model such as the dielectric model used here , for each conformation .

    "the treatment of the thermodynamics of flexible complexes in solution is also discussed further in the appendix and in reference @xcite . ] the solvation contribution to the chemical potential eq .",
    "[ average ] would then be combined with the isolated cluster partition function to obtain the free energies of the species involved and free energy changes for the reactions@xcite . finally , an entropic contribution , including any conformational entropy ,",
    "would be obtained by temperature differentiation of the full chemical potential .",
    "the isolated cluster partition functions would properly include an entropy associated with the multiplicity of isoenergetic conformational states .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that this conformational entropy increases progressively with hydrolysis , _",
    "i.e. _ the products here are `` less ordered , '' and have higher conformational entropy than their reactants .",
    "it is thus significant that the predicted reaction free energies are higher than the experiment ; inclusion of conformational entropy should lower these reaction free energies .",
    "we note that li , _",
    "et al._@xcite argue that inclusion of a second solvation shell substantially improves the accuracy of the thermochemical predictions .",
    "the present results do not seem to force us to larger clusters .",
    "although it is true that proper inclusion of more water molecules should permit a more convincing treatment , inclusion of more distant water molecules makes the neglect of conformational entropy less tenable . in any case ,",
    "comparison of dielectric model treatments with thermochemical results only permits limited conclusions because of the empirical adjustability of radii - parameters .",
    "given the balance of the large contributions that must be considered , the observed accuracy of the computed hydrolysis reaction free energies reactions is encouraging .",
    "evidently many structural possibilities will have to be treated for a full description of ferric ion speciation in water , eventually considering higher aggregates and anharmonic vibrational motions of the strongly interacting water molecules and other ligands .",
    "these issues are probably best pursued through development of a molecular mechanics force field to screen structures rapidly , reserving electronic structure calculations for verification of the important structures found and refinement of the force field .",
    "the energetic ordering found here for isomers of fe(h@xmath0o)@xmath5(oh)@xmath0@xmath28 is _ cis _ ( lowest ) , _ outer sphere _ , and",
    "( highest ) , but all these energies are within about 2  kcal / mol .",
    "molecular mechanics force fields might be reparameterized to account for these results@xcite .",
    "identification of prominent isomers should simplify and improve the modeling of the temperature variations of thermodynamic properties .",
    "it deserves emphasis also that substantial contributions to these reaction free energies , and to the accumulated uncertainties , are associated with the water partners in these reactions , _",
    "i.e. _ the free energies associated with solvation of h@xmath0o and h@xmath7o@xmath28 .",
    "a similar comment would apply for other common oxy - acids and ligands in water , _",
    "e.g. _ carbonate , nitrate , sulfate , and phosphate .",

    "this work was supported by the ldrd program at los alamos .",
    "lrp thanks marshall newton for helpful discussions on these topics .",
    "here we specify with greater care some of the statistical thermodynamic considerations relevant to solvation free energies obtained from cluster calculations of the present variety@xcite .",
    "we note that these issues are of minor importance for the hydrolysis reactions that are the focus of this paper .",
    "however , these considerations become more important for the absolute free energy reported for the aqueous ferric ion and for the free energy of dissociation of the outer sphere complex .",
    "we first specify more fully and explain the procedure from computing the absolute free energy of the ferric ion given in table  [ t_1b ] on the basis of cluster results obtained from density functional theory and the dielectric continuum estimate of solvation contributions .",
    "the result of the development here is a formula for the chemical potential of the ferric ion : @xmath34 here @xmath35 the number density of ferric ions in the solution , @xmath36 is the volume of the system , @xmath37 is the partition function of the isolated hexaaquoferric complex ( m = fe(h@xmath0o)@xmath1@xmath2 ) , @xmath38 is the solvation free energy of the complex , and @xmath39 is the chemical potential of the water .",
    "the conclusion drawn from this formula is that the desired absolute free energy of the hydrated ferric ion is obtained from the chemical potential change of the reaction fe@xmath2 + 6h@xmath0o @xmath40 fe(h@xmath0o)@xmath1@xmath2 except with the additional provisions that the chemical potentials should be evaluated on a fully molecular basis at the water concentration of interest and no solvation contribution should be included for the atomic ion .",

    "what about cases when more than one cluster should be considered ? how might this approach be justified more fully and how might the calculations be improved ?",

    "this argument is an adaptation of the potential distribution theorem@xcite .    in order to involve information on clusters , we express the density of interest in terms of cluster concentrations .",
    "thus , if the fe@xmath2 ion appears only once in each cluster , _",

    "adjusting the dummy summation variables them leads to eq .",
    "[ pdt ] .      a virtue of the derivation of eq .",
    "[ pdt ] sketched here is that the primordial activities @xmath69 and @xmath70 are clear from the beginning .",
    "this helps in the present circumstance where concentrations and chemical potentials of many other species and combinations will be of interest also .    combining our preceding results , we obtain @xmath71 this is a reexpression according to clusters of a basic result known both within the context of the potential distribution theorem@xcite and diagrammatic ( mathematical ) cluster expansions . for the latter context see eq .",
    "2.7 of reference  @xcite .",
    "rearranging , we obtain the desired chemical potential @xmath72 this is the result that was sought . if higher - order clusters had been considered with a suitable clustering definition , the final result would have involved a more general polynomial of @xmath69 ; higher powers of @xmath69 would appear in the sums that would replace eq .",

    "[ answer2 ] result is that the thermodynamic activity of the water appears explicitly and that contribution may be included in a variety of convenient ways , perhaps utilizing experimental results .",
    "furthermore , we see that there is no question whether a particular standard state for the water is relevant or , for example , whether only the excess part of the chemical potential of the water is required .    notice that if the cluster definition had been restrictive enough that only the atomic m = fe@xmath2 were present in appreciable concentration , _",
    "@xmath46=0 for all clusters that need be considered , then eq .

    ". then it would be sufficient to put @xmath74 , the cube of the debroglie wavelength of the ferric ion .",
    "@xmath75 is the mass of the ion , and @xmath76 is the planck constant . in any case , we define the absolute free energy of the hydrated ferric ion as the second term on the right @xmath77 . in view of eq .",

    "this eq .",
    "[ answer4 ] is the formula that was used .",
    "a generalization of interest is the case that the solvent contains more than one species that may complex with a specific metal ion .",
    "for example , suppose that ammonia may be present in addition to water , that mixed complexes may form with ferric ion , and that these complexes have been studied as clusters in the same way that the hexaaquoferric ion complex was studied above .",
    "then the result eq .",
    "[ answer2 ] is straightforwardly generalized by including the proper combinations of activities of the additional ligands possible .",
    "many _ ab initio _ electronic structure packages , such as the gaussian94 package used here , can produce molecular ( or cluster ) partition functions @xmath50 and on this basis free energies for the species and reactions considered .",
    "it should be emphasized that these are typically applicable to a hypothetical ideal gas at concentrations corresponding to pressure p=1 atm , see table  [ t_1a ] .",
    "thus , for example , these results determine the ideal chemical potential @xmath79 . however , because of the choice of hypothetical p=1  atm ideal gas standard state , those results use @xmath80 with p=1  atm . in gaussian94 , for example , this logarithmic concentration dependence is considered a translational entropy contribution and , therefore , the entropic contribution to the reaction free energy of the first reaction in table  [ t_1a ] is substantial and unfavorable . because of the dilute reaction medium associated with p=1  atm , the water molecules written as reactants in this reaction have more freedom before complexation than they do after .",
    "this is an entirely expected physical effect but inappropriate in solution . to obtain results applicable at the concentration of liquid water",
    "we determine that pressure parameter @xmath81 from the experimental density of liquid water @xmath82= 997.02  kg / m@xmath83 .",
    "the required value is p=1354  atm as indicated in table  [ t_1b ] .",
    "when this value is utilized in the expression for the translational entropy contributions , the translational entropy penalty of table  [ t_1a ] for the first reaction is about half recovered . because the second through fifth reactions of table  [ t_1a ] were written to have the same molecule numbers for reactions and products this translational entropy contribution is very minor in those cases .",
    "we note also that the experimental tabulation of reference  @xcite suggested as an experimental result for the absolute free energy of the hydrated ferric ion ( -1037  kcal / mol ) of table  [ t_1b ] requires an adjustment of about 1.9 kcal / mol @xcite for similar reasons .",
    "this adjustment is insignificant for that property with the methods used here .",
