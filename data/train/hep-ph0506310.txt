    "the data are then used to constrain the mass of the higgs boson at the quantum level@xcite , which is the last undetermined parameter of the model .",

    "although in such models the parameters are severely constrained by the rho parameter data , some new physics models would give a motivation to study phenomenology of these exotic representations .",

    "we then consider testing the @xmath1 coupling via single @xmath0 production in the @xmath2 fusion process at the lhc . in general , higgs boson production by vector boson fusion has advantages as compared to the other production processes , because the signal can be reconstructed completely and jet production is suppressed in the central region due to lack of color flow between the initial state quarks@xcite .",
