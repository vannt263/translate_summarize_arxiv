    "<S> we investigate electromagnetic propagation in uniaxial dielectrics with a transversely varying orientation of the optic axis , the latter staying orthogonal everywhere to the propagation direction . </S>",
    "<S> in such a geometry , the field experiences no refractive index gradients , yet it acquires a transversely - modulated pancharatnam - berry phase , that is , a geometric phase originating from a spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the periodic modulation of the geometric phase in propagation generates a longitudinally - invariant effective potential . </S>",
    "<S> going beyond the recent report on periodically modulated systems [ nat . photon . 10.1038/nphoton.2016.138 ( 2016 ) ] , we show that , in certain configurations , this geometric phase can provide transverse confinement and waveguiding . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical findings are tested and validated against numerical simulations of the complete maxwell s equations . </S>",
    "<S> our results introduce and illustrate the role of geometric phases on electromagnetic propagation over distances well exceeding the diffraction length , paving the way to a whole new family of guided waves and waveguides which do not rely on refractive index tailoring .    several materials in nature feature an anisotropic - i.e. , direction dependent - electromagnetic response . </S>",
    "<S> anisotropy is usually modeled by second - order tensors , in general coupling all the components of the electromagnetic field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest case corresponds to non - magnetic anisotropic dielectrics , described by the constitutive equations @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the relative permittivity tensor , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the vacuum permittivity and permeability , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> when the permittivity tensor is constant in space , for a given wavevector direction maxwell s equations support two mutually orthogonal plane - wave eigensolutions with distinct refractive indices @xcite , i.e. , exhibit birefringence . </S>",
    "<S> orthogonality is no longer maintained when the optic axis is inhomogeneously rotated in the plane normal to the wavevector , yielding a point - wise accumulation of pancharatnam - berry phase ( pbp ) upon propagation . </S>",
    "<S> only recently it has been recognized that a beam phase - front can be modified by means of the pbp @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + we refer to monochromatic waves ( angular frequency @xmath5 , time dependence @xmath6 , vacuum wavelength @xmath7 and wavenumber @xmath8 ) in uniaxial crystals ( i.e. , two out of the three eigenvalues of @xmath2 coincide ) with dielectric tensor @xmath9 in the diagonal basis @xmath10 , corresponding to the principal axes . </S>",
    "<S> the refractive indices for electric fields orthogonal or parallel to the optic axis are @xmath11 or @xmath12 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a uniaxial with a point - dependent rotation of @xmath2 around the principal axis @xmath13 , the latter coinciding with  the direction of wave propagation . in such configuration </S>",
    "<S> the ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices remain always equal to @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , and waves experience no spatial walk - off . defining @xmath16 as the local angular rotation of @xmath10 with respect to the laboratory framework @xmath17 ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> when @xmath27 , with @xmath28 an integer , the rcp wave transforms into lcp : this change in polarization state is accompanied by a dynamic phase change @xmath29 and a phase shift @xmath30 of purely geometric origin , a manifestation of pbp @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> analogous dynamics occurs for a lcp input , now leading to an inverted geometric phase , i.e. , @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> equations   show that geometric phases can modify electromagnetic wavefronts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , since diffraction is neglected , they rigorously apply only to plane waves or wavepackets propagating in the anisotropic material for distances much smaller than the rayleigh length . to analyze propagation for longer distances </S>",
    "<S> , we must go beyond the plane - wave limit implicit in eqs .   and investigate the interplay between diffraction and the pancharatnam - berry geometric phase , as we will do in the following . </S>",
    "<S> + we note that , while the pbp is maximum in the planes such that @xmath32 , it vanishes in the planes where @xmath33 , and takes intermediate values in between @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in homogeneous media , the pbp oscillates along propagation , apparently without cumulative effects . </S>",
    "<S> as we reported recently @xcite , anisotropic dielectrics with a periodically modulated transverse orientation of the optic axis can yield a net cumulative pbp versus propagation . </S>",
    "<S> + in this letter we show that significant long - term effects of the pbp on wave propagation can be obtained even in perfectly invariant media along the propagation direction , that is , in the absence of longitudinal modulations of the optic axis distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate , in particular , that the fast longitudinal modulation of the geometric phase gives rise to an effective @xmath34-invariant photonic potential through a kapitza - like effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this potential can support lateral confinement , hence paving the way to the realization of novel electromagnetic waveguides not based on refractive index changes , but on spin - orbit interactions between field polarization and wavefront . at variance with the case of longitudinally - modulated media </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , such pbp - confinement is _ independent _ of the input polarization while it is immune from distributed reflections , a relevant feature in applications . </S>",

    "<S> the angle @xmath16 is positive when the rotation is counter - clockwise from the observer s point of view . </S>",
    "<S> the labeled points ( a , b , c ) in the graphs correspond to orientation of the principal axes as sketched above . </S>",

    "<S> the inhomogeneity consists of an @xmath39dependent rotation of the uniaxial principal axes ( as sketched in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sketch_geometry ] ) , with eigenvalues @xmath40 and @xmath41 of the relative permittivity tensor independent of the spatial position . neglecting anisotropy in the diffraction operator @xcite , in the laboratory framework @xmath17 </S>",

    "<S> the paraxial approximation in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> allows neglecting the longitudinal electric field , the latter relevant for beam sizes comparable with the wavelength @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> next , we rewrite eq .   in a rotating framework </S>",
    "<S> aligned locally to the principal axes , introducing the 2d rotation operator @xmath44 around the symmetry axis @xmath45 @xmath46 with @xmath16 varying only across @xmath47 , as in fig . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath57 is a diagonal matrix , @xmath58 , constant in space due to the uniform distribution of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and reduced to a 2@xmath592 tensor due to the transverse character of the electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of terms depending on geometry ( i.e. , @xmath16 and its derivatives ) resembles transformation optics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all the terms containing @xmath60 account for power exchange between ordinary and extraordinary components : owing to diffraction , a purely ordinary ( extraordinary ) wave in any given point is partially coupled into neighboring ( transverse ) regions with different @xmath16 , thus yielding a mutual interaction between the two orthogonal polarizations , regardless of the reference system . </S>",
    "<S> consistently , the size of such terms depends on the spatial derivatives of @xmath16 . such non - abelian evolution and the absence of _ invariant modes </S>",
    "<S> _ were predicted earlier for light propagating in smoothly inhomogeneous anisotropic media @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + we apply the slowly varying envelope approximation through the transformation @xmath61 and @xmath62 , i.e. , factoring out the dynamic phase responsible for polarization rotation versus propagation . for paraxial beams , eq .   </S>",
    "<S> yields        @xmath63    equations ( [ eq : svea_ord]-[eq : svea_ext ] ) indicate that the waves are not subject to refractive index gradients , as the transverse modulation is only due to the point - wise rotation of the principal axes . for small birefringence @xmath64 , eqs .  </S>",

    "<S> @xmath73 is proportional to @xmath54 and equivalent to a time - dependent magnetic field normal to the particle spin and inducing spin - rotation ( in our case a power exchange between extraordinary and ordinary components ) . </S>",
    "<S> + following the analogy drawn above , the second terms on the rhs of eqs .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : svea_ord]-[eq : svea_ext ] ) the potential @xmath77 arises from the transverse rotation of the dielectric tensor , which acts equally on both ordinary and extraordinary components . when the coupling terms on the rhs of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : svea_ord]-[eq : svea_ext ] ) are negligible as compared to @xmath78 @xcite , the latter can lead to transverse confinement and waveguiding with wavelength - independent mode profiles determined only by the spatial distribution of @xmath16 , i.e. , the geometric arrangement of the anisotropic dielectric . </S>",
    "<S> the effective potential eq .   originates from the periodic oscillation of the geometric phase @xmath79 along @xmath34 , as the latter phase can be associated to a periodic potential @xmath80 acting on the wave . owing to the kapitza effect stemming from the transverse modulation of the effective kinetic energy @xcite , </S>",
