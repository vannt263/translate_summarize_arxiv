    "sums of cantor sets have been considered in many papers and in many different settings ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "it is also connected to spectral theory ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . the spectra of certain types of two dimensional quasicrystal models can be written as sums of two dynamically defined cantor sets @xcite .",
    "the study of sums of cantor sets also has natural connection to the study of intersections of cantor sets ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is easy to see that a sum of two cantor sets contains an interval if and only if they have stable intersection .    in @xcite ,",

    "this is a phenomena which never appears in sums of two cantor sets under the condition of @xmath6 .",
