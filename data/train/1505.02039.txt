    "structural default framework is widely used for assessing credit risk of a corporate debt .",
    "it was introduced in a simple form in the seminal work @xcite , and was further extended in various papers , see a survey in @xcite and references therein .",
    "in contrast to reduced - form models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) structural default models suffer from the curse of dimensionality when the number of counterparties grows ; however , these models provide a more detailed and financially meaningful description of the default event for a typical firm .    inspired by @xcite ,",
    "in @xcite we extended the structural framework by taking into account the fact that banks have mutual liabilities among themselves .",
    "accounting for this effect is very important in order to accurately analyze credit worthiness of individual banks and the banking network as a whole .",
    "for instance , large mutual liabilities imply that adverse shock to a bank is rapidly transmitted to the entire system , with severe implications for its stability ( @xcite ) .",
    "the authors of @xcite indicate that renegotiations between highly interconnected banks facilitate mutual private sector bailouts to lower the need for government bailouts",
    ". the relative size of mutual liabilities compared to total liabilities is fairly substantial .",
    "for instance , the relative fraction of interbank loans is 12% in the eu , 8.5% for canada ( @xcite ) , and 4.5% for us ( as per economic research website of the federal reserve bank of st .",
    "louis ) .",
    "an extended merton model with mutual liabilities and continuous default monitoring can be built by combining correlated merton balance sheet models , calibrated by using observed bank equity returns , and analyzing potential clearing of interbank liabilities in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we assumed that banks assets are driven by correlated lvy processes with idiosyncratic and common components and developed a novel pseudo partial differential equation computational method in order to make the problem of computing joint and marginal survival probabilities tractable .",
    "the effect of mutual liabilities was discussed , and numerical examples were given to illustrate its importance .",
    "obviously , the knowledge of joint and marginal survival probabilities is important for successful calibration of the model to credit default swap ( cds ) spreads and first - to - default ( ftd ) instruments .",
    "since the general case is fairly complicated , here we restrict ourselves to the case when banks assets are driven by correlated brownian motions with drifts . then",
    "in the 2d case we obtain explicit expressions for several quantities of interest including joint and marginal survival probabilities as well as cds and ftd prices . despite the fact that the model under consideration does not incorporate jumps , it is still beneficial as it enables an analytical assessment and provides a natural link to the analytical framework considered in @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ model ]",
    "we propose a model for the general case of @xmath0 banks .",
    "sections  [ ge],[surv ] present the governing equations and green s function approach to the solution of these equations for joint and marginal survival probabilities for two banks with mutual obligations . in sections  [ scds],[sftd ]",
    "the prices of cds and ftd contracts are calculated , and results of our numerical experiments are presented .",
    "we also validate our results by comparing analytical solutions with numerical solutions obtained by using a finite difference algorithm described in @xcite .",

    "the above assumptions can be generalized in a variety of ways , which will be discussed elsewhere .",

    "these default boundaries are valid if no other bank defaults till @xmath20 .",
    "now assume the opposite , i.e. that the @xmath24-th bank is the first to default at time @xmath25 , and so we are left with a set of @xmath34 surviving banks . at time @xmath35 the assets and liabilities of the @xmath7-th bank , @xmath36 , have the form @xmath37    we assume that for surviving banks mutual liabilities stay the same , while their external liabilities jump according to the rule @xmath38    surviving banks capital naturally takes a hit@xmath39    thus , each default reduces the set of surviving banks and modifies the corresponding default boundaries as @xmath40   + \\sum_{j\\ne i , j\\ne k } \\left[r_i l_{ij}(t ) - l_{ji}(t ) \\right ] , \\nonumber \\\\ \\lambda _ { ik}^=(t ) & = l_i(t ) + l_{ik}(t ) - r_{k}l_{ki}(t ) + \\sum_{j\\ne i , j\\ne k } \\left[l_{ij}(t ) - l_{ji}(t ) \\right ] , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as an example , consider @xmath41 .",

    "it can be seen that the boundary condition in at @xmath20 does nt match to the terminal condition which , according to , reads @xmath99    mathematically , this means that our problem belongs to the class of problems with a boundary ( transition ) layer at @xmath20 .",
    "financially , the behavior of the solution in this layer is determined by the detailed specification of the contract .",
    "for instance , if the bank is close to maturity , say a day before , the recovery rate could be defined to smoothly transit from @xmath30 to 1 within this last day . or , some other conditions specific to the contract in question could be issued .",
    "however , we do nt consider these details , assuming that the boundary layer is thin , and , therefore , any perturbation of the solution due to the existence of this layer , is dumped out pretty fast when moving away from this layer . in other words , as we ignore a detailed consideration of the boundary layer , our solution experiences a jump at @xmath20 . therefore , after the closed form solution is found we will compare it with the numerical solution of this problem to reveal sensitivity of the former to the value of the described effect .",
    "below we provide all the results just for two - dimensional case @xmath41 while the multi - dimensional case will be presented elsewhere .",
