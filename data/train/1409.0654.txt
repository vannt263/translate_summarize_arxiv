    "the need of applying a statistical approach arises in physics when the global properties of ensembles containing a huge number of elementary constituents are studied . in this case",
    ", the behavior of the single element ( microstate ) is irrelevant in favor of more informative averages on the whole ensemble ( macrostate ) . in this sense ,",
    "the situation is strictly analogous in both population and quantitative genetics , where the analysis of allele frequencies and phenotype distribution parameters is preferred to the genetic / phenotipic description of each individual .",
    "the analogy between quantitative genetics and thermodynamics , noted from the very beginning by r. a. fisher himself @xcite , allowed to introduce a concept of entropy for population genetics which satisfies the analogous of h - theorem @xcite .",
    "such information entropy measure ensures an exact solution at statistical equilibrium @xcite .",
    "this point of view , can be alternatively seen by defining a free fitness , namely the entropy divided by population size plus the mean fitness .",
    "the free fitness is maximized at equilibrium when natural selection and drift ( random sampling ) are at work @xcite , and provides an analogous of free energy in thermodynamics . for a summary of the correspondence between evolutionary dynamics and statistical physics",

    "interestingly , for population size @xmath0 and mutation rate @xmath1 , such that @xmath2 , the macroscopic quantities change their behavior showing a kind of _ phase transition_. moreover , abrupt and gradual changes in the optimum , as well as changes in the strength of stabilizing selection seem to induce hysteresis phenomena , which can be understood imaging that the macroscopic trajectories keep memory of the underlying genetic states .    in the present paper",
    ", we analyze such phase transition phenomena looking for a more detailed statistical mechanics description . to this aim",
    ", we perform numerical simulations of a stochastic model , extensively analyzed in the past years ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "it consists in a population of @xmath0 diploid hermaphrodite individuals , reproducing in pairs in a random mating regime , evolving under the effect of drift , selective pressure in form of viability , and mutation .",
    "following wright s seminal paper @xcite , we consider @xmath3 different biallelic genes additively combining on the character , and the individual viability following a gaussian profile in the trait .",
    "the model differs from those of ref .",
    "@xcite for the large interval of mutation rate considered here , and for the chosen fitness of the phenotype .",
    "furthermore , in our analysis , the size of the population @xmath0 plays the same role of the finite dimension in a physical system .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 diploid individuals , sexually reproducing with random mating between any pairs of individuals .",
    "each individual is represented by two sequences of @xmath3 variables , @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 stands for the two genome replicas , and @xmath6 runs on different loci ) .",
    "we refer to @xmath4 as alleles , and assume that each allele can take two values , @xmath7 . at each generation",
    ", all individuals are removed , and a new generation of same size @xmath0 is formed by off - springs of the previous individuals .",
    "a mutation rate , @xmath1 , is introduced , as the probability of an allele to mutate at each generation ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "similar models were studied in ref.s @xcite .",
    "we denote the additive polygenic phenotype random variable with @xmath9 .",
    "a stabilizing selective pressure on such a phenotype can be implemented via the survival probability of an offspring , typically known as _ viability _ , @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the suitable normalization constant , @xmath12 measures the _ strength of selection _ , and @xmath13 stands for the optimum phenotype ( hereafter , we choose for simplicity @xmath14 ) . for @xmath15",
    ", there is no selective pressure , and all the microscopic states are equivalent .",
    "whereas , for @xmath16 , the selective pressure is at maximum , and the only surviving individuals are those with @xmath17 .",
    "thus , in general , the effect of the selective pressure is to reduce the accessible phase space to those microscopic states satisfying _ in probability _ the constraint on the phenotype .",
    "let us denote with @xmath18 the initial frequency of the allele `` @xmath19 '' in locus @xmath20 .",
    "we consider for simplicity a starting population where the @xmath3 variants are @xmath7 with equal probability , namely @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "this ansatz does not restrict the generality of the analysis , in fact for finite populations , random drift rapidly homogenizes the initial distribution of allele frequencies , making the final results almost independent of the initial assumption on @xmath18 @xcite .    to describe the macroscopic state of the system",
    ", we introduce the following quantity : @xmath23 with @xmath24 where @xmath25 stands for the average over @xmath26 initially identical realizations of the system ( hereafter simply denoted by _",
    "ensemble _ of populations ) .",
    "note that the definition of @xmath27 is inspired by a statistical mechanics analogue .",
    "in fact , if the quantity @xmath28 of eq .",
    "( [ magnj ] ) resembles the magnetization per spin of an ising model of @xmath29 spins , @xmath27 of eq .",
    "( [ magn ] ) gives the average of the magnetization modulus once properly normalized @xcite .",
    "following the same analogy , we also introduce the _ susceptibility _ , as @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the _ magnetization _ @xmath28 of j - th locus is related to the _ expected _ heterozygosity ( fraction of heterozygous individuals expected on the basis of hardy - weinberg equilibrium condition ) in the same locus , denoted by @xmath32 , which is a more familiar quantity in the population genetics context .",
    "indeed , one can easily prove that @xmath33 it is worth observing , that in our case @xmath32 essentially coincides with the _ observed _ heterozygosity ( observed fraction of heterozygous individuals ) . from eq .",
    "( [ het ] ) , we see that the minimum of magnetization corresponds to the maximum of heterozygosity , and vice - versa .",
    "denoting with @xmath34 the average of @xmath32 over different loci and on the ensemble , one can easily prove that @xmath35 for a very large number of realizations .",

    "note that , for large @xmath1 , the alleles @xmath7 have roughly equal probability ( namely , @xmath41 for each locus ) , and hence the steady state does not significantly differ from the initial one . on the contrary , for small @xmath1 , in the steady state @xmath42 for each locus .",
    "in this case , the individuals are just clones , namely , for each realization , the population is represented by a unique genome that is a generic combination of @xmath7 in a neighborhood of the phenotype optimum ( exactly in the optimum for @xmath43 ) .",
    "the crossover from the state with small @xmath27 ( large heterozygosity ) to the state with @xmath40 ( small heterozygosity ) is characterized by a maximum in the susceptibility , @xmath37 .",
