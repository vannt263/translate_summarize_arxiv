    "many quantum experiments involve time - independent apparatus . by this",
    "we mean that for each run of such an experiment , the apparatus which prepares the initial state , shields it from the environment during that run and detects the outcome state is classically determined and fixed .",
    "such experiments will be called type 1 . in quantum optics , double - slit , mach - zehnder , and quantum eraser experiments",
    "@xcite are of this type .",
    "so too are high energy particle scattering experiments such as those conducted at the lhc in cern .",
    "type 1 experiments are important because they allow the focus of attention to be entirely on the dynamical evolution of states of suos ( systems under observation ) , normally regarded as the prime objective of sqm ( standard quantum mechanics ) .",
    "sqm generally describes type 1 experiments via time - independent hamiltonians .",
    "a second class of experiment , referred to here as type 2 , involves some time - dependence in the apparatus , such that any changes in the apparatus during a run are controlled externally , either by the experimentalist or by environmental factors .",
    "spin - echo magnetic resonance experiments are of this type , because the experimentalist arranges for certain magnetic fields to be rotated precisely whilst additionally , the environment introduces random external influences related to local temperature .",
    "an example of random changes controlled by the experimentalist are delayed - choice experiments such as that of jacques et al @xcite , where carefully arranged random changes are made during each run .",
    "sqm typically describes such experiments via time - dependent hamiltonians .",
    "type 2 experiments are more interesting than type 1 because they have the potential to reveal more information about the dynamics of suos than type 1 .",
    "source theory shows that in principle , type 2 experiments allow for the extraction of all possible information about quantum systems schwinger-1969 .",
    "type 1 and type 2 experiments may be collectively labelled as _ exophysical _ , because all classical apparatus interventions are external in origin . in such experiments ,",
    "the apparatus is classically well defined at each instant of time during each run , even in those situations where it changes randomly .",
    "therefore , a classical block universe price:1997 account of apparatus during each run of a type 1 or 2 experiment is possible .    in this paper",
    "we explore a third type of quantum experiment , which we label type 3 , or _ endophysical . _ in such experiments , the apparatus is modified internally by the quantum dynamics of the suo , rather than externally by the observer or the environment . an interesting question which we shall address towards the end of this paper",
    "is whether type 3 experiments can always be given a classical block universe account or whether something analogous to superpositions of different apparatus has to be envisaged ( not to be confused with superpositions of states of suos ) .",
    "this question is related to the rules of quantum information extraction as they are currently known in sqm .",
    "these rules state that quantum interference can occur in the absence of classical which - path information , the most well - known example of this being the double - slit experiment .",
    "the question here is what precisely does a lack of which - path information mean : _ if _ such as thing as a photon passed through one of the slits , would it leave any trace in principle ?",
    "even if it did , it might be believed that any such interaction a photon had with atoms at either slit would be on the quantum level , far below the scales of classical mechanical detection , and so the observer of the interference pattern would simply be unaware of such interaction .",
    "this seems wrong to us on two counts : first , there is now sufficient evidence against the notion that photons are particles in the conventional sense @xcite and second , one observer being unaware of actual which - path information held by another observer could not by itself induce interference patterns .",
    "there has to be something deeper than that in the origin of quantum interference .",
    "the neutron interference experiment discussed by greenberger and yasin greenberger+yasin-1989 explores this question by moving towards larger scales of interaction between suo and apparatus . in their experiment ,",
    "the movement of mirrors involved in their quantum erasure scheme involves a macroscopic numbers of atoms and molecules @xcite . in this case , the dynamical effects of the impact of a particle on a mirror is reversed by a second impact .",
    "what is amazing is the idea that all possible traces of the first impact could be completely erased , even though there could ( in principle ) be time for information from the first impact to be dissipated into the environment , thereby rendering the process irreversible .",
    "we take this line of thinking one step further .",
    "one of the experiments we propose and discuss here appears to involve the superposition of states of different beamsplitters , which are macroscopic pieces of apparatus .",
    "at least one of these beamsplitters has to be triggered if any interference effects are observed , but that observation can not occur if the information as to which beamsplitter is involved can be extracted by the observer .",
    "if such an experiment were carried out and quantum interference observed , then the implications would be that quantum principles apply to apparatus as well as states of suos , thereby demonstrating that the laws of quantum information are truly universal .",
    "we focus exclusively on linear quantum evolution , i.e. , one conforming with the principles of sqm as discussed for example in @xcite , rather than appeal to any form of non - linear quantum mechanics to generate self - intervention effects .",
    "we explore a number of type 3 thought experiments involving photons , which act as either quantum or classical objects at various times . as quantum objects they pass through beam - splitters and suffer random outcomes as a result . as classical objects",
    "they are used to trigger the switching on or off of macroscopic apparatus , a switching which determines the subsequent quantum evolution of other photons .",
    "we shall not discuss the nature of photons per se , except to say that they are referred to as particles for convenience only : our ideology and formalism treats them as signals in elementary signal detectors ( esds ) @xcite .",
    "everything is idealized here , it being assumed that all detectors operate with one hundred percent efficiency and that photon polarizations and wavelengths can be adjusted wherever necessary to make the scenarios discussed here physically realizable .",
    "the experiments we discuss are not necessarily based on photons : other particles such as electrons could be used in principle .",
    "we use the schrdinger picture throughout , using a hilbert space quantum register of sufficiently many qubits to model all information exchange requirements . in our notation",
    ", @xmath0 denotes a two photon signal state , equivalent to @xmath1 in standard notation and to @xmath2 in @xcite , where @xmath3 is the void or @xmath4no - signal@xmath5 state of the apparatus and @xmath6 is a signal operator creating a positive signal state at esd @xmath7 .",
    "capital letters such as @xmath8 represent complex outcome probability amplitudes .",
    "to illustrate the sort of experiment we are interested in , we start with the basic experiment shown schematically in figure 1 . a correlated , non - entangled two photon state @xmath9 is created by source @xmath10 .",
    "such states can be created by parametric down conversion and suitable filtering .",
    "photon @xmath11 is subsequently passed through beamsplitter @xmath12 and emerges in state @xmath13 or @xmath14 with amplitudes @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively , such that @xmath17 .",
    "if esd @xmath13 is triggered rather than esd @xmath14 , then a macroscopic mechanism triggers beamsplitter @xmath18 to be activated . in all diagrams ,",
    "squares denote apparatus modules such as sources of photon pairs and beamsplitters , circles denote esds and single lines denote optical pathways .",
    "dotted double lines denote signal detection followed by classical switching on of apparatus .",
    "photon @xmath7 meanwhile is sent over a sufficiently long optical path to ensure that photon @xmath11 has been detected in one of the esds @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "only then does @xmath7 enter that part of the apparatus which has been prepared by the outcome of beamsplitter @xmath12 .",
    "if the outcome was @xmath13 , then @xmath7 enters beamsplitter @xmath18 and emerges in state @xmath19 or @xmath20 with amplitude @xmath8 and @xmath21 respectively , such that latexmath:[$%    @xmath12 was @xmath23 , then @xmath18 is not switched on , so that @xmath7 is unaffected and gets registered as an unaltered photon @xmath7 .     triggers the switching on of beamsplitter @xmath18.,width=192 ]",
    "the labstate @xcite @xmath24 just before any photons are detected is given by@xmath25 in ( [ 111 ] ) , photon @xmath13 is included in the state explicitly .",
    "this is because although it is necessarily absorbed during the switching on of beamsplitter @xmath18 , the observer can determine the fact that that switching has occurred , and this is equivalent to the detection of a photon by an esd . in our formalism , esds are any processes which result in classical signal information being extracted from a quantum state .",
    "as stated above , we think of photons not as particles but as quanta of information .    from ( [ 111 ] ) we can immediately read off the three possible non - zero outcome probabilities:@xmath26which sum to unity as required .",
    "the next variant experiment is shown in figure 2 .",
    "now photons @xmath7 and @xmath11 pass through beamsplitters @xmath18 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "if detected , outcome @xmath27 of @xmath12 switches on beamsplitter @xmath28 , whereas if detected , outcome @xmath23 of @xmath12 switches on beamsplitter @xmath29 .",
    "the dynamics is calculated as follows .",
    "the initial labstate is @xmath30 .",
    "subsequently , we have @xmath31 and @xmath32 , with @xmath33 .        for the next stage",
    ", we refer to figure @xmath34 to write down the following substage evolution rules:@xmath35where @xmath36 .",
    "this gives@xmath37from this we immediately read off six non - zero correlation probabilities , such as @xmath38 , and so on .",
    "none of these probabilities demonstrates any quantum interference , because complete which - path information is available in each case .",
    "the third scenario is shown in figure 3 . in this case , the initial photon pair is passed through a pair of beamsplitters exactly as in experiment 2 .",
    "the difference lies in the next stage .",
    "photons @xmath19 and @xmath14 are sent off over sufficiently long optical paths so as to allow interference between photons @xmath20 and @xmath13 in beamsplitter @xmath28 .",
    "note that this interference essentially involves waves from different source photons @xmath7 and @xmath11 , so phase and wavelength matching would have to be arranged .",
    "provided this is the case , then the dynamics is given by@xmath39where the coefficients @xmath40 satisfy the relations@xmath41these being the most general conditions required to ensure unitarity .",
    "the labstate at this stage is therefore@xmath42if the outcome from @xmath28 is @xmath43 , then beamsplitter @xmath29 is switched on , otherwise it remains off .",
    "can trigger beamsplitter @xmath29.,width=336 ]    for the final stage , photons @xmath19 and @xmath14 are brought together so as to interact with the result of the decision made at @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath43 had been triggered , then @xmath19 and @xmath14 interact in beamsplitter @xmath29 , otherwise they evolve normally and do not interact .",
    "the dynamics is given by@xmath44where the @xmath45 coefficients satisfy the generalized beamsplitter relations@xmath46    the final labstate is given by@xmath47from which we read off the non - zero probabilities@xmath48these probabilities sum to unity as required .    in this variant experiment , two of the outcome probabilities , @xmath49 and @xmath50",
    "show interference .",
    "this interference has essential contributions from beamsplitters @xmath28 and @xmath29 in a manner which seems impossible to explain in terms of photons as classical particles .    in all experiments where quantum interference takes place",
    ", there inevitably has to be some which - path uncertainty somewhere .",
    "this does not occur in variant experiments @xmath51 or @xmath34 but does occur in variant @xmath52 .",
    "the results can be simplified somewhat by assuming each beamsplitter is symmetric , i.e. , @xmath53 .",
    "there is a well - known change of phase due to reflection at a beamsplitter , relative to the transmitted beam @xcite .",
    "if we take @xmath54 , @xmath55 , we find @xmath56 in an actual experiment , we expect that pathlengths would need to be tuned carefully in order to obtain these effects .",
    "rotating beamsplitter @xmath28 so as to interchange the roles of reflection and transmission at @xmath28 should then interchange the results for @xmath57 and @xmath50 , confirming that constructive and destructive interference is taking place .",
    "similar remarks apply to beamsplitter @xmath29 .",
    "proposed experiment 3 should be viable with current technology .",
    "if interference effects were detected as predicted , then that would demonstrate not only that classical information extraction ( at @xmath43 ) need not destroy interference taking place after that extraction , but also that such classical intervention can play an essential role in the optical paths involved .",
    "although it involves the possibility of self - intervening apparatus change , experiment 3 does not involve any erasure of such a change . to investigate this , we need to go further . to this end",
    ", we first return to the basic double slit experiment and investigate what happens when we try to detect a photon at any of the slits .",
    "the double - slit experiment with no which - path detection is shown in figure 4 .",
    "the initial labstate is @xmath58 , where @xmath59 esds @xmath60 , with @xmath61 .",
    "the dynamical rules for no - which - path detection are@xmath62where@xmath63hence the final labstate is@xmath64from which we read off the detection probabilities@xmath65these demonstrate quantum interference and sum to unity as required .",
    "now suppose that we allow for the possibility of detecting from which slit a photon came as it lands on the detecting screen .",
    "we introduce two new esds , labelled @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which give information about @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively . the experimental architecture is now given by figure 5 .",
    "assuming perfectly efficient detection at @xmath66 and @xmath67 , the dynamics is now given by@xmath70so the final labstate is now@xmath71this time , we have the probabilities@xmath72which sum to unity .",
    "moreover , the total probability @xmath73 is just the sum @xmath74 , which is the classical expectation showing no interference .",
    "we can imagine performing a variant of this experiment where detection at each slit is not perfect , i.e. , we consider a smooth transition from the complete which - path scheme of figure @xmath75 to the complete no - which - path scheme of figure @xmath76 .",
    "we replace the dynamical schemes ( [ 222 ] ) or ( 333 ) by@xmath77where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are real .",
    "the case @xmath80 corresponds to complete no - which - path information , figure @xmath81 whilst @xmath82 corresponds to complete which - path information , figure @xmath75 .",
    "the final labstate is now given by@xmath83the respective probability distributions are readily read off and the total detection probability @xmath73 at esd @xmath84 turns out to be@xmath85this shows how the quantum interference term disappears the more which - path information becomes certain , i.e. , in the limits when @xmath86 or @xmath87 .",
    "a particular feature of the double - slit experiment is that detection at just one slit alone destroys the interference term .",
    "another important feature is that elimination of which - way information is pre - determined by the observer choosing not to have any detection equipment at both slits , corresponding to @xmath88 , rather than any quantum erasure process of the type discussed in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "what is surprising is that this choice is quite sufficient to produce interference on the detecting screen even in the case where the particles are bound states such as neutrons or molecules and can not be regarded as elementary in any true sense .    before the advent of quantum mechanics ,",
    "any analysis suggesting that lack of which - path information about particle trajectories led to interference would have been regarded as fanciful .",
    "yet double - slit interference is an experimental fact .",
    "it is reasonable , therefore , to investigate the possibility that such interference could happen on even larger macroscopic scales , provided true which - way information was absent . to this end",
    "we propose the experiment discussed next .",
    "consider the detector network shown in figure 6 , a modification of the double self - intervention network shown in figure 2 .",
    "the difference is that the triggered beamsplitters @xmath28 and @xmath29 now feed onto the same pair of esds labelled @xmath43 and @xmath89 .",
    "such an arrangement would require careful matching of the beamsplitters @xmath28 and @xmath29 beforehand .",
    "the first two stages are as in experiment 2 , i.e. , we have @xmath90 .",
    "we shall employ the same method as in experiment 4 to parametrize the transition from complete no - which - path information to complete which - path information .",
    "we write@xmath91where the @xmath40 satisfy the unitarity relations discussed earlier .",
    "hence we find@xmath92which gives the total probabilities @xmath93 at esds @xmath43 and @xmath94 respectively to be@xmath95    in the limit where there is complete which - path detection , i.e. , @xmath96 or @xmath97 , we recover the results of experiment @xmath98 , taking into account that @xmath43 and @xmath89 each then have to be regarded as two esds . in the limit of complete no - which - path information ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath88 , we expect to observe interference effects at @xmath43 and @xmath89 .",
    "the only real issue is whether all which - path information involving beam - splitters @xmath28 and @xmath29 could be eliminated by mechanical means sufficiently to produce interference . by this we mean removing all traces of which beamsplitter had been triggered , equivalent to an @xmath4information black hole@xmath5 .",
    "this would undoubtedly require controlling the interaction between the triggering beamsplitters @xmath28 and @xmath29 and their environment , perhaps by intense cooling and shielding .",
    "the time scale for such erasure would undoubtedly be a critical factor also .",
    "it is possible that no technology could be devised to erase all traces of beamsplitter switching , for both practical and theoretical reasons . theoretically ,",
    "resetting a triggered beamsplitter to its untriggered state amounts to resetting a pointer , and this is expected to carry a cost in terms of irreversibility .",
    "the discussion in @xcite is relevant here .    if it really were the case that all information concerning the triggering of @xmath28 or @xmath29 could never be erased , then interference at @xmath43 and @xmath89",
    "should never be observed , according to the rules of quantum mechanics .",
    "this would mean that there really were two types of erasure .",
    "the first can be called _ quantum erasure _ , examples of which are the double - slit experiment and the experiment discussed by walborn et al .",
    "interference can be observed in such cases .",
    "the second type of erasure , _ classical erasure _ , requires physical intervention on the part of the observer .",
    "the big question then is whether classical and quantum erasure are fundamentally different or not .",
    "we believe that an experiment along the lines of our experiment 5 could be viable with current technology , but it would not be easy .",
    "a sequence of steps would be taken , attempting to remove with more and more efficiency and completeness any trace of which beamsplitter had been triggered , corresponding to @xmath78 and @xmath79 both approaching @xmath99 .",
    "it is our intuition , based on the double - slit experiment and the experiment of greenberger and yasin @xcite , that a point should come where interference at @xmath43 and @xmath89 started to manifest itself , but where that point is and whether it is attainable in practice are open questions .",
    "certainly , it would be an interesting experiment to attempt : even the slightest hint of interference at @xmath43 and @xmath89 would cast light on the fundamental questions @xmath4__is there a heisenberg cut?__@xmath5 and @xmath100__if there is such a cut , where does it start?__@xmath5 ."
