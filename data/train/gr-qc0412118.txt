    "<S> in this paper , by applying newman - janis algorithm to a spherically symmetric ` seed ' metric , we present general rotating metrics in terms of newman - penrose ( np ) quantities involving wang - wu functions . from these np quantities </S>",

    "<S> these embedded solutions can be expressed in kerr - schild forms describing the extensions of glass and krisch superposition , which is further the extension of xanthopoulos superposition . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that , by considering the charge to be a function of radial coordinate , the hawking s continuous radiation of black holes can be expressed in classical spacetime metrics for these embedded black holes . </S>",
    "<S> it is also found that the electrical radiation will continue to form ` instantaneous ' charged black holes and creating embedded negative mass naked singularities describing the possible life style of radiating embedded black holes during their contineous radiation processes . </S>",

    "<S> introduction *    in the theory of black hole expressed in spherical polar coordinates , there is a singularity at the origin @xmath0 ; whereas at infinity @xmath1 , the metric approaches the minkowski flat space . </S>",
    "<S> the event horizons of a black hole are expressed by this coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the nature of black holes depends on the radial coordinate @xmath2 . in an earlier paper [ 1 ] </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that hawking s radiation [ 2 ] can be expressed in classical spacetime metrics , by considering the charge @xmath3 to be function of the radial coordinate @xmath2 of non - rotating reissner - nordstrom as well as rotating kerr - newman black holes . </S>",
    "<S> the variable - charge @xmath4 with respect to the coordinate @xmath2 is followed from boulware s suggestion [ 3 ] that _ the stress - energy tensor may be used to calculate the change in the mass due to the radiation_. according to boulware s suggestion , the energy momentum tensor of a particular space can be used to calculate the change in the mass in order to incorporate the hawking s radiation effects in classical spacetime metrics . </S>",
    "<S> this idea suggests to consider the stress - energy tensor of electromagnetic field of different forms or functions from those of reissner - nordstrom , as well as kerr - newman , black holes as these two black holes do not seem to have any direct hawking s radiation effects . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a variable charge in the field equations will have the different function of the energy momentum tensor of the charged black hole . </S>",
    "<S> _ such a variable charge @xmath3 with respect to the coordinate @xmath2 in einstein s equations is referred to as an electrical radiation ( or hawking s electrical radiation ) of the black hole_. so , for every electrical radiation we consider the charge @xmath3 to be a function of @xmath2 in solving the einstein - maxwell field equations and we have shown _ mathematically _ how the electrical radiation induces to produce the changes of the mass of _ variable_-charged black holes . </S>",
    "<S> one may incorporate the idea of losing ( or changing ) mass at the rate as the electrical energy is radiated from the charged black hole . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the change in the mass of a charged black hole takes place due to the vanishing of ricci scalar of the electromagnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> every electrical radiation @xmath4 of the black holes leads to a reduction in its mass by some quantity . </S>",
    "<S> if we consider such electrical radiation taking place continuously for a long time , then a continuous reduction of the mass will take place in the black hole body , and the original mass of the black hole will evaporate completely . at that stage </S>",
    "<S> the complete evaporation of the mass will lead the gravity of the object depending only on the electromagnetic field , and not on the mass . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to such an object with zero mass as an ` instantaneous ' naked singularity - a naked singularity that exists for an instant and then continues its electrical radiation to create negative mass [ 1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> so this naked singularity is different from the one mentioned in steinmular _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ [ 4 ] , tipler _ et al _ [ 5 ] in the sense that an ` instantaneous ' naked singularity , discussed in [ 4,5 ] exists only for an instant and then disappears .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also noted that the time taken between two consecutive radiations is supposed to be so short that one may not physically realize how quickly radiations take place . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it seems natural to expect the existence of an ` instantaneous ' naked singularity with zero mass only for an instant before continuing its next radiation to create a negative mass naked singularity . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that it may also be possible in the common theory of black holes that , as a black hole is invisible in nature , one may not know whether , in the universe , a particular black hole has mass or not , but electrical radiation may be detected on the black hole surface . immediately after the complete evaporation of the mass , </S>",
    "<S> if one continues to radiate the remaining remnant , there may be a formation of a new mass . </S>",
    "<S> if one repeats the electrical radiation further , the new mass might increase gradually and then the spacetime geometry will represent the negative mass naked singularity . </S>",
    "<S> the classical spacetime metrics , for both stationary rotating and non - rotating , which represent the negative mass naked singularities have given in [ 1 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this paper is to give examples of rotating charged solutions of einstein s field equations from the general metric for studying the hawking s electrical radiation effects . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions derived here describe rotating embedded black holes i.e. , the kerr - newman black hole is embedded into ( i ) the rotating vaidya null radiating space , ( ii ) the rotating vaidya - de sitter cosmological universe and ( iii ) the rotating monopole space to generate the kerr - newman - vaidya , the kerr - newman - vaidya - de sitter and the kerr - newman - monopole black holes respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the definitions of these embedded black holes are in agreement with the one defined by cai et at . </S>",
    "<S> [ 6 ] , that _ when the scharzschild black hole is embedded into the de sitter space , one has the schwarzschild - de sitter black hole_. thus , these solutions describe new _ non - stationary _ rotating , kerr - newman - vaidya and kerr - newman - vaidya - de sitter , and _ stationary _ kerr - newman - monopole black holes . </S>",
    "<S> these embedded rotating solutions can be expressed in kerr - schild forms to regard them as the extension of glass - krisch superposition [ 7 ] , which is further the extension of that of xanthopoulos [ 8 ] . </S>",
    "<S> these kerr - schild ansatze show that these embedded black holes are solutions of einstein s field equations . </S>",
    "<S> it is also noted that such generation of embedded solutions in _ non - rotating _ cases can be seen in [ 9 ] . </S>",
    "<S> here we try to extend the earlier results [ 1 ] based on hawking s radiation of _ non - embedded _ </S>",
    "<S> , reissner - nordstrom as well as kerr - newman , black holes to these _ embedded _ kerr - newman - vaidya , kerr - new- + man - vaidya - de sitter and kerr - newman - monopole black holes .    </S>",

    "<S> we discuss the physical properties of the solutions observing the nature of their energy momentum tensors and weyl scalars . </S>",

    "<S> initially , when @xmath5 , @xmath3 are constant , this metric provides the non - rotating reissner - nordstrom solution and also when both @xmath5 , @xmath3 are functions of @xmath13 , it becomes the non - rotating vaidya - bonnor solution [ 13 ] .    </S>",

    "<S> the formation of negative mass naked singularities in classical spacetime metrics is being shown in [ 1 ] after the complete evaporation of the masses of _ non - embedded _ </S>",
    "<S> rotating kerr - newman and non - rotating reissner - nordstrom , black holes due to hawking electrical radiation .    here </S>",
    "<S> we shall clarify two similar nomenclatures having different meaning like hawking s radiation and vaidya null radiation . </S>",
    "<S> hawking s radiation is continuous radiation of energy from the black hole body thereby leading to the change in mass [ 1 - 5 ] , whereas the vaidya null radiation means that the stress - energy momentum tensor describing the gravitation in vaidya spacetime metric is a null radiating fluid [ 33 ] . </S>",
    "<S> so vaidya null radiation does not have any direct relation with hawking s radiation of black holes [ 10 ] .    _ </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) variable - charged kerr - newman - vaidya black hole _    as mentioned earlier in the introduction , by electrical radiation of a charged black hole we mean the variation of the charge @xmath3 with respect to the coordinate @xmath2 in the stress - energy momentum tensor of electromagnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this variation of @xmath3 will certainly lead different forms or functions of the stress - energy tensor from that of kerr - newman - vaidya black hole . to observe the change in the mass of black hole in the spacetime metric </S>",
    "<S> , one has to consider a different form or function of stress - energy tensor of a particular black hole . </S>",
    "<S> that is , in order to incorporate the hawking s radiation in this black hole ( 3.15 ) , we must have a different stress - energy tensor as the kerr - newman - vaidya black hole with @xmath190 ( 3.16 ) does not have any direct hawking s radiation effects . </S>",
    "<S> the consideration of different forms of stress - energy - momentum tensor in the study of hawking s radiation effect in classical spacetime metrics here is followed from boulware s suggestion [ 5 ] mentioned in introduction above .    </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that the kerr - newman - vaidya black hole , describing the kerr - newman black hole embedded into the rotating vaidya null radiating universe ( 3.4 ) , is quite different from the standard kerr - newman black hole . </S>",
    "<S> that is , ( i ) the kerr - newman - vaidya black hole is algebraically special in petrov classification with the weyl scalars @xmath231 , @xmath232 , where as the standard kerr - newman black hole is petrov type @xmath61 with @xmath233 , @xmath234 . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) the kerr - newman - vaidya black hole possesses the total energy - momentum tensor ( 3.16 ) , representing interaction of the null radiating fluid @xmath48 with the electromagnetic field @xmath187 , i.e. , the charged null radiating fluid ; however the energy - momentum tensor of the kerr - newman black hole is that of electromagnetic field @xmath235 , simply a charged black hole . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) the kerr - newman - vaidya black hole is a non - stationary extension of the stationary kerr - newman black hole . due to the above differences between the two black holes , it is worth studying the physical properties of the embedded black hole . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it is hoped that the study of hawking electrical radiation in the rotating kerr - newman - vaidya black hole will certainly lead to a different physical feature than that of _ non - embedded _ kerr - newman black hole .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , we consider the line element of a variable - charged kerr - newman - vaidya black hole with respect to the coordinate @xmath2 as follows ( by changing @xmath107 to @xmath5 for better understanding ) : @xmath236\\,du^2 \\cr & & + 2du\\,dr + 2ar^{-2}\\{2r(m+f(u ) ) \\cr & & -e^2(r)\\}\\,{\\rm sin}^2 \\theta\\,du\\,d\\phi -2a\\,{\\rm sin}^2\\theta\\,dr\\,d\\phi \\cr & & -r^2d\\theta^2 -\\{(r^2+a^2)^2 \\cr & & -\\delta^*a^2\\,{\\rm sin}^2\\theta\\}\\,r^{-2}{\\rm sin}^2\\theta\\,d\\phi^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath237 . then , with the variable charge @xmath4 in the above metric , there will be a different energy - momentum tensor from that of the original kerr - newman - vaidya metric ( 3.15 ) . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , we have to calculate the ricci and weyl scalars from the field equations with the functions @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> however , instead of calculating directly from the field equations , one can use the solutions given in ( 3.6 ) and ( 3.8 ) to obtain these scalars . for the completeness we present them as follows : @xmath238 , \\\\ & \\psi_3=&{-i\\,a\\,{\\rm sin}\\theta\\over 2\\surd 2\\overline r\\,\\overline r\\,r^2}\\big\\{(4\\,r+\\overline r)f(u)_{,u}\\big\\ } , \\cr & \\psi_4=&{{a^2r\\,{\\rm sin}^2\\theta}\\over 2\\overline r\\,\\overline r\\,r^2\\,r^2}\\,\\big\\{r^2f(u)_{,uu}-2rf(u)_{,u}\\big\\}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from these we observe that the variable charge @xmath4 has the effect only on the scalars @xmath41 , @xmath44 and @xmath168 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the non - vanishing of @xmath43 , @xmath239 , @xmath240,and @xmath241 indicate the different physical feature of non - statio + nary kerr - newman - vaidya black hole from the stationary standard kerr - newman black hole . one important feature of the field equations corresponding to the metric ( 4.1 ) with @xmath4 is that the expressions for @xmath41 and @xmath44 do not involve the vaidya mass function @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> so it suggests the possibility to study the hawking electrical radiation in this non - stationary black hole .    </S>",
    "<S> now for an electromagnetic field , the ricci scalar @xmath242 ( 4.3 ) has to vanish leading to the solution @xmath243 where @xmath244 and @xmath245 are real constants . substituting this @xmath246 in ( 4.2 ) and ( 4.4 ) , and after identifying the constant @xmath247 , we obtain @xmath248 . </S>",

    "<S> accordingly , the maxwell scalar @xmath124 with constant @xmath3 becomes @xmath249 which is the same maxwell scalar of the kerr- + newman - vaidya metric ( 3.15 ) if once written out from ( 3.12 ) . from the weyl scalar ( 4.7 ) we have clearly seen _ a change in the mass @xmath5 _ by some constant quantity @xmath244 ( say ) for the first electrical radiation in the embedded black hole . </S>",
    "<S> then the total mass of kerr - newman - vaidya black hole becomes @xmath250 and the metric takes the form @xmath251\\,du^2 \\cr & & + 2du\\,dr + 2ar^{-2}\\{2r(m - m_1+f(u ) ) \\cr & & -e^2\\}\\,{\\rm sin}^2\\theta\\,du\\,d\\phi -2a\\,{\\rm sin}^2\\theta\\,dr\\,d\\phi -r^2d\\theta^2 \\cr & & -\\{(r^2+a^2)^2 -\\delta^*a^2\\,{\\rm sin}^2\\theta\\}\\,r^{-2}{\\rm sin}^2\\theta\\,d\\phi^2 , \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath252 . </S>",
    "<S> since the maxwell scalar ( 4.8 ) remains the same for the first hawking radiation , we again consider the charge @xmath3 to be a function of @xmath2 for the second radiation in the metric ( 4.9 ) with the mass @xmath253 . </S>",
    "<S> this will certainly lead , by the einstein - maxwell field equations with the vanishing of @xmath44 to reduce another quantity @xmath254 ( say ) from the total mass , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ the mass becomes @xmath255 after the second electrical radiation . here </S>",
    "<S> again , we observe that the maxwell scalar @xmath124 remains the same form and also there is no effect on the vaidya mass function @xmath114 after the second radiation . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if we consider @xmath104 radiations , every time taking the charge @xmath3 to be a function of @xmath2 , the einstein s field equations will imply that the total mass of the black hole will take the form @xmath256 without affecting the mass function @xmath114 . taking hawking s radiation of charged black hole embedded in the rotating vaidya null radiating space </S>",
    "<S> , one might expect that the mass @xmath5 may be radiated away , just leaving @xmath257 equivalent to the planck mass of about @xmath258 and @xmath114 untouched ; that is , @xmath5 may not be exactly equal to @xmath259 , but has a difference of about a planck - size mass . otherwise , the mass @xmath5 may be evaporated completely after continuous radiation , when @xmath260 , just leaving the vaidya mass function @xmath114 and the electric charge @xmath3 only . </S>",

    "<S> thus , if we consider @xmath104 radiations , every time considering the charge @xmath3 to be a function of @xmath2 , the maxwell scalar @xmath124 will be the same as in ( 4.38 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however the mass will become @xmath325 without affecting monopole constant @xmath203 . </S>",
    "<S> taking hawking s radiation of charged black holes into account , one might expect that the mass @xmath5 may be radiated away , just leaving @xmath326 equivalent to the planck mass . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , the mass @xmath5 may be evaporated completely after continuous radiation , when @xmath327 , just leaving the monopole constant @xmath203 and the electric charge @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can show this situation of the black hole in the form of a classical spacetime metric as @xmath328\\,du^2 + 2du\\,dr \\cr & & + 2ar^{-2}\\{b\\,r^2-e^2\\}\\,{\\rm sin}^2 \\theta\\,du\\,d\\phi \\cr & & -2a\\,{\\rm sin}^2\\theta\\,dr\\,d\\phi - r^2d\\theta^2-\\{(r^2+a^2)^2 \\cr & & -\\delta^*a^2\\,{\\rm sin}^2\\theta\\}\\,r^{-2}{\\rm sin}^2\\theta\\,d\\phi^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath329 . at this stage </S>",
    "<S> the gravity of the surface would depend on electric charge and monopole constant , not on the mass . </S>",
    "<S> this metric has the non - zero weyl scalar @xmath330,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] describing the curvature of the remaining remnant . </S>",
    "<S> however , the maxwell scalar @xmath124 is unaffected . </S>",
    "<S> the metric describes the rotating charged monopole black hole with the horizons at @xmath331 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> as the electrical radiation has to continue , this black hole will remain only for an instant . </S>",
    "<S> hence , one can refer to the solution ( 4.41 ) as an ` instantaneous ' charged black hole with the surface gravity @xmath332\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the hawking s temperature @xmath303 . </S>",
    "<S> the entropy and angular velocity of the horizon are given as @xmath333 immediately , after the exhaustion of the kerr - newman mass , if the remaining solution ( 4.41 ) continues to radiate electrically with @xmath4 , there will be a formation of new mass @xmath271 ( say ) . </S>",
    "<S> if this electrical radiation process continues forever , the new mass will increase gradually as @xmath334 however , it appears that this new mass will never decrease . </S>",
    "<S> then , the spacetime metric will take the following form @xmath335du^2 + 2du\\,dr \\cr & & + 2ar^{-2}\\{b\\,r^2 - 2r{\\cal m}^*-e^2\\}\\,{\\rm sin}^2 \\theta\\,du\\,d\\phi \\cr & & -2a\\,{\\rm sin}^2\\theta\\,dr\\,d\\phi - r^2d\\theta^2-\\{(r^2+a^2)^2 \\cr & & -\\delta^*a^2\\,{\\rm sin}^2\\theta\\}\\,r^{-2}{\\rm sin}^2\\theta\\,d\\phi^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath336 . </S>",
    "<S> this metric has the weyl scalar @xmath337 \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] describing the gravity of the surface with negative sign . </S>",
    "<S> this metric ( 4.44 ) expresses the negative mass naked singularity embedded into the rotating mono- + pole solution i.e. , the metric can be expressed in kerr - schild ansatz based on different backgrounds as @xmath338 where @xmath339 , and @xmath340 with @xmath225 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath222 is the rotating monopole solution and @xmath283 represents the negative mass naked singularity metric tensor . </S>",
    "<S> the vector @xmath22 is a geodesic , shear free , expanding as well as non - zero twist null vector which is one of the repeated principal null vectors of both @xmath222 as well as @xmath283 . </S>",
    "<S> these two kerr - schild forms indicate that the metric ( 4.44 ) is a solution of einstein s field equations .    </S>",
    "<S> * 5 . </S>",
    "<S> conclusion *    in this paper , we have presented np quantities for a rotating spherically symmetric metric with three variables in an appendix . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the general expressions in np quantities can be used to discuss the general properties of the spacetimes . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the metric ( 2.3 ) with three variables , in general possesses a geodesic , shear free , rotating and expanding null vector @xmath22 as shown in ( 2.8 ) and ( 2.9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the non - vanishing @xmath168 , @xmath240 , @xmath241 , presented in appendix ( a2 ) suggests that the spacetime metric ( 2.3 ) is algebraically special in the petrov classification . with the help of these np quantities </S>",
    "<S> , we have first given a class of rotating solutions like , rotating vaidya - bonnor , rotating vaidya , kerr - newman and rotating de sitter . </S>",
    "<S> then , with the help of wang - wu functions , we come to the unpublished examples of rotating metrics that we combined them with other rotating solutions in order to generate new embedded rotating solutions like kerr - newman - vaidya , kerr - newman - vaidya - de sitter , kerr - newman - monopole , and studied the gravitational structure of the solutions by observing the nature of the energy momentum tensors of respective spacetime metrics . </S>",
    "<S> the embedded rotating solutions have also been expressed in terms of kerr - schild ansatze in order to indicate them as solutions of einstein s field equations . </S>",
    "<S> these ansatze show the extensions of those of glass and krisch [ 7 ] and xanthopoulos [ 8 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the remarkable feature of the analysis of rotating solutions in this paper is that all the rotating solutions , stationary petrov type @xmath61 and non - stationary algebraically special possess the same null vector @xmath22 , which is geodesic , shear free , expanding as well as non - zero twist . from the studies of the rotating solutions we find that some solutions after making rotation have disturbed their gravitational structures . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the rotating monopole solution ( 3.45 ) with @xmath229 possesses the energy momentum tensor with the monopole pressure @xmath38 , where the monopole charge @xmath203 couples with the rotating parameter @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the rotating de sitter solution ( 3.25 ) becomes petrov type @xmath61 spacetime metric , where the rotating parameter @xmath82 is coupled with the cosmological constant . after making rotation in ( 3.4 ) </S>",
    "<S> , the vaidya metric with @xmath84 becomes algebraically special in petrov classification of spacetime metric with a null vector @xmath22 which is geodesic , shear free , expanding and non - zero twist . </S>",
    "<S> the wang - wu functions in the rotating metric ( 3.10 ) play a great role in the derivation of the rotating embedded solutions discussed here . </S>",
    "<S> the method adopted here with wang - wu functions might be another possible version for obtaining _ non - stationary _ rotating black hole solutions with visible energy momentum tensors describing the interaction of different matter fields with well - defined physical properties like guth s modification of @xmath190 ( 3.39 ) etc . </S>",
    "<S> it is believed that such interactions of different matter fields as in ( 3.16 ) , ( 3.35 ) , ( 3.39 ) and ( 3.46 ) have not seen published before . </S>",
    "<S> we have also found the direct involvement of the rotation parameter @xmath82 in each expression of the surface gravity and the angular velocity , which shows the important of the study of rotating , embedded and non - embedded , black holes in order to understand the nature of different black holes located in the universe .    in section 4 , we find that the changes in the masses of embedded black holes take place due to the vanishing of ricci scalar of electromagnetic fields with the charge @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that the hawking s radiation can be expressed in classical spacetime metrics , by considering the charge @xmath3 to be the function of the radial coordinate @xmath2 of kerr - newman - vaidya , kerr - newman - vaidya - de sitter and kerr - newman - monopole black holes . </S>",
    "<S> that is , every electrical radiation produces a change in the mass of the charged objects . </S>",
    "<S> these changes in the mass of black holes embedded into vaidya , vaidya - de sitter and monopole spaces , after every electrical radiation , describe the relativistic aspect of hawking s evaporation of masses of black holes in the classical spacetime metrics . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we find that the black hole evaporation process is due to the electrical radiation of the variable charge @xmath4 in the energy momentum tensor describing the change in the mass in classical spacetime metrics which is in agreement with boulware s suggestion [ 3 ] </S>",
    "<S> . the hawking s evaporation of masses and the creation of embedded negative mass naked singularities are also due to the continuous electrical radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the formation of embedded naked singularity of negative mass is also hawking s suggestion [ 2 ] mentioned in the introduction above . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that , if one accepts the continuous electrical radiation to lead the complete evaporation of the original mass of black holes , then the same radiation will also lead to the creation of new mass to form negative mass naked singularities . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly indicates that an electrically radiating embedded black hole will not disappear completely , which is against the suggestion made in [ 2,3,5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that we observe the different results from the studies of _ embedded _ and _ non - embedded _ </S>",
    "<S> black holes . in the embedded cases here above , the presence of vaidya mass in ( 4.11 ) , the vaidya mass and the cosmological constant in ( 4.25 ) and the monopole charge in ( 4.41 ) completely prevent the disappearance of embedded radiating black holes during the radiation process and thereby , the formation of ` instantaneous ' charged black holes . in _ non - embedded _ </S>",
    "<S> cases in [ 1 ] , the disappearance of a black hole during radiation process is unavoidable , however occurs for an instant with the formation of ` instantaneous ' naked singularity with zero mass , before continuing its next radiation . </S>",
    "<S> it is also noted that the ` instantaneous ' black holes ( 4.11 ) , ( 4.25 ) and ( 4.41 ) admit the total energy momentum tensors ( 3.16 ) , ( 3.35 ) and ( 3.46 ) respectively as these tensors are not affected by the hawking s radiation .    </S>",
    "<S> it appears that ( i ) the changes in the mass of black holes , ( ii ) the formation of ` instantaneous ' naked singularities with zero mass and ( iii ) the creation of ` negative mass naked singularities ' in _ non - embedded _ reissner - nordstrom as well as kerr - newman black holes [ 1 ] are presumably the correct formulation in classical spacetime metrics of the three possibilities of black hole evaporation suggested by hawking and israel [ 34 ] . </S>",
    "<S> however , the creation of ` negative mass naked singularities ' may be a violation of penrose s cosmic censorship hypothesis [ 19 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that ( i ) the changes in the masses of embedded black holes , ( ii ) the formation of ` instantaneous ' charged black holes ( 4.11 ) , ( 4.25 ) and ( 4.41 ) , and ( iii ) the creation of embedded ` negative mass naked singularities ' in kerr - newman - vaidya , kerr - newman - vaidya - de sitter , kerr - newman - monopole black holes might presumably be the mathematical formulations in classical spacetime metrics of the three possibilities of black hole evaporation [ 34 ] . </S>",
    "<S> all embedded black holes discussed here can be expressed in kerr - schild ansatze , accordingly their consequent negative mass naked singularities are also expressible in kerr - schild forms showing them as solutions of einstein s field equations . </S>",
    "<S> it is also observed that once a charged black hole is embedded into some spaces , it will continue to embed forever through out its hawking evaporation process . </S>",
    "<S> for example , kerr - newman black hole is embedded into the rotating vaidya null radiating universe , it continues to embed as ` instantaneous ' charged black hole in ( 4.11 ) and embedded negative mass naked singularity as in ( 4.14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> there hawking s radiation does not affect the vaidya mass through out the evaporation process of kerr - newman mass . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , in the cases of kerr - newman - vaidya - de sitter as well as kerr - newman - monopole black holes we find that the vaidya mass , the cosmological constant and the monopole charge remain unaffected . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the embedded negative mass naked singularities ( 4.14 ) , ( 4.27 ) and ( 4.44 ) possess the total energy momentum tensors ( 3.16 ) , ( 3.35 ) and ( 3.46 ) respectively , as the kerr - newman mass does not involved in these tensors , and the change in the mass due to continuous radiation does not affect them . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it may be concluded that once a black hole is embedded into some universes , it will continue to embed forever without disturbing the nature of matters present . </S>",
    "<S> if one accepts the hawking continuous evaporation of charged black holes , the loss of mass and creation of new mass are the process of the continuous radiation . </S>",
    "<S> so , it may also be concluded that once electrical radiation starts , it will continue to radiate forever describing the various stages of the life of radiating black holes .    </S>",
    "<S> also , we find from the above that the change in the mass of black holes , _ embedded _ or _ non - embedded _ , takes place due to the maxwell scalar @xmath341 , remaining unchanged in the field equations during continuous radiation . </S>",
    "<S> so , if the maxwell scalar @xmath341 is absent from the space - time geometry , there will be no radiation , and consequently , there will be no change in the mass of the black hole . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can not , theoretically , expect to observe such _ </S>",
    "<S> relativistic change _ in the mass of uncharged schwarzschild as well as kerr black holes . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that these uncharged schwarzschild as well as kerr black holes will forever remain the same without changing their life styles . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , as far as hawking s radiation effect is concerned , they may be referred to as _ relativistic death black holes_.    from the study of hawking s radiation above , it is also found that , as far as the embedded black holes are concerned , the kerr - newman black hole has relations with other rotating black holes , like the charged vaidya black hole ( 4.11 ) , the charged vaidya - de sitter ( 4.25 ) and the rotating charged monopole ( 4.41 ) . </S>",
    "<S> there the later ones are ` instantaneous ' black holes of the respective embedded ones . </S>",
    "<S> it is also noted that the rotating charged de sitter , when @xmath122 in ( 4.25 ) , may be regarded as an instantaneous cosmological black hole of kerr - newman - de sitter . it is observed that the classical spacetime metrics discussed above would describe the possible life style of radiating embedded black holes at different stages during their continuous radiation . these _ embedded _ classical spacetimes metrics describing the changing life style of black holes are different from the _ non - embedded _ ones studied in [ 1 ] in various respects shown above . here </S>",
    "<S> the study of these embedded solutions suggests the possibility that in an early universe there might be some black holes , which might have embedded into some other spaces possessing different matter fields with well - defined physical properties .    </S>",
