    "the observation of the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in ultracold , atomic gases has greatly stimulated research on the properties of this fascinating quantum state of matter .",
    "@xcite    a particular interest lies in the controlled manipulation of the coherence and the entanglement of the bec state ,  @xcite which provide the basis of applications such as quantum computing and quantum communications .",
    "@xcite as an example , a new scheme of performing quantum dense coding  @xcite and teleportation  @xcite was proposed using the spatial - mode entanglement of a single massive boson coupled to a bec reservoir .",
    "@xcite here one considers a system of two coupled tightly confined potentials , each of which forms one of the spatial modes , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in order for the full dense coding protocol to work ,",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 have to share a common reference frame with which they can exchange particles .",
    "a bec consisting of an indefinite number of particles fulfills this role  @xcite and the coherent control of the bec state is essential to let a signal between @xmath2 and @xmath3 be phase - locked .    on the other hand",
    ", there have been extensive studies of decoherence , a process of loosing quantum superpositions due to entanglement between a microscopic system and its environment .",
    "@xcite the decoherence mechanism is crucial to understand the transition between quantum and classical systems  @xcite in a sense that quantum superposition between distinct states of macroscopic systems is suppressed by the decoherence process .",
    "however the environmental effects  @xcite make it difficult to probe of the decoherence of macroscopic system directly . as an alternative way , one can use the coupling of a microscopic system , such as an atomic quantum dot , to a mesoscopic or macroscopic system to probe the decoherence of the latter .",
    "for instance , there have been several proposals on the single - atom - aided probe of the decoherence of a bec .",
    "@xcite    in the theoretical schemes above , a bec state is represented as the bose - field operator , @xmath4 with the density @xmath5 and the phase @xmath6 of the condensate , of which the only available excitations at low energies are phonons with linear dispersion .",
    "however the excitations of a bec state is phononlike only for wavelengths larger than the healing length @xmath7 , where the healing length @xmath7 is defined as the distance over which the condensate wave function grows from zero to the bulk value . in general , the strong collisional interaction in the atomic quantum dot ( aqd ) can locally break a bec state to bring up the excitations of normal particles inside of the dot . the bosonic single - impurity anderson model ( b - siam )  @xcite",
    "is proposed to describe the normal excitations in the aqd as well as the condensate part .",
    "another motivation for studing the b - siam comes from a treatment of the bose - hubbard model within the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) .",
    "@xcite the dmft is an exact theory in infinite spatial dimensions  @xcite but , as an approximation for finite dimensional system , it was successful to provide comprehensive understanding about strongly correlated fermion systems .",
    "recently , a new framework of the bosonic dmft ( b - dmft ) was proposed by byczuk and vollhardt  @xcite in order to extend the idea of the dmft to correlated lattice bosons and mixtures of bosons and fermions on a lattice.@xcite in contrast to the fermionic dmft ( f - dmft ) , the lattice model for bosons is mapped into a single - impurity problem with two species of bath spectra , those from the condensate bosons and those from the normal bosons , each of which should be self - consistently determined .",
    "the resulting effective bosonic impurity model has been solved by exact diagonalization ( ed ) method .",
    "@xcite results have been presented for various phases at finite temperatures and compared to other theories and the experiments .",
    "the structure of the effective impurity model in the b - dmft is reduced to the b - siam in the absence of the bath spectrum from the condensate bosons , which is the case in the mott insulating ( mi ) phase . on the basis of the current work",
