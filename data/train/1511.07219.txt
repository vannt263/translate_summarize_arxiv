    "detailed spectroscopic studies of the nucleon excitation spectrum and the structure of these excited states have played a central role in the development of our understanding of the dynamics of the strong interaction .",
    "the concept of quarks that emerged through such studies led to the development of the constituent quark model  @xcite ( cqm ) in the 1980s . as a result of intense experimental and theoretical effort over the past 30 years ,",
    "it is now apparent that the structure of the nucleon and its spectrum of excited states ( @xmath0 ) are much more complex than what can be described in terms of models based on constituent quarks alone . at the typical energy and distance scales found within the @xmath0 states , the quark - gluon coupling is large .",
    "therefore , we are confronted with the fact that quark - gluon confinement , and hence the dynamics of the @xmath0 spectrum , can not be understood through application of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) techniques .",
    "the need to understand qcd in this non - perturbative domain is a fundamental issue in nuclear physics that the study of @xmath0 structure can help to address .",
    "such studies , in fact , represent the necessary first steps toward understanding how qcd generates mass , i.e. how mesons , baryons , and atomic nuclei are formed .    studies of low - lying baryon states , as revealed by electromagnetic probes at low four - momentum transfer ( @xmath9  gev@xmath8 ) , have revealed @xmath0 structure as a complex interplay between the internal core of three dressed quarks and an external meson - baryon cloud .",
    "@xmath0 states of different quantum numbers have notably different relative contributions from these two components , demonstrating distinctly different manifestations of the non - perturbative strong interaction in their generation .",
    "the relative contribution of the quark core increases with @xmath7 in a gradual transition to a dominance of quark degrees of freedom for @xmath10  gev@xmath8 .",
    "this kinematics area still remains almost unexplored in exclusive reactions .",
    "studies of the @xmath7 evolution of @xmath0 structure from low to high @xmath7 offer access to the strong interaction between dressed quarks in the non - perturbative regime that is responsible for @xmath0 formation .",
    "electroproduction reactions provide for a probe of the inner structure of the contributing @xmath0 resonances through the extraction of the amplitudes for the transition between the incident virtual photon - nucleon state and the final @xmath0 state , i.e. the @xmath5 electrocoupling amplitudes , which describe the physics . among these amplitudes are @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which describe the @xmath0 resonance electroexcitation for the two different helicity configurations of a transverse photon and the nucleon , as well as @xmath13 , which describes the @xmath0 resonance electroexcitation by longitudinal photons of zero helicity .",
    "detailed comparisons of the theoretical predictions for these amplitudes with their experimental measurements is the basis of progress toward understanding non - perturbative qcd .",
    "the extraction of the @xmath5 electrocouplings is needed in order to gain access to the dynamical momentum - dependent mass and structure of the dressed quark in the non - perturbative domain where the quark - gluon coupling is large  @xcite .",
    "this is critical in exploring the nature of quark - gluon confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) in baryons .",
    "current theoretical approaches to understand @xmath0 structure fall into two broad categories .",
    "in the first category are those that enable direct connection to the qcd lagrangian , such as lattice qcd ( lqcd ) and qcd applications of the dyson - schwinger equations ( dse ) . in the second category",
    "are those that use models inspired by or derived from our knowledge of qcd , such as quark - hadron duality , light - front holographic qcd ( ads / qcd ) , light - cone sum rules ( lcsr ) , and cqms . see ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview of these different approaches .",
    "it is important to realize that even those approaches that attempt to solve qcd directly can only do so approximately , and these approximations ultimately represent limitations that need careful consideration . as such , it is imperative that whenever possible the results of these intensive and challenging calculations be compared directly to the data from electroproduction experiments over a broad range of @xmath7 for @xmath0 states with different quantum numbers .",
    "comparisons of the experimental results on the @xmath5 electrocouplings to the theoretical predictions provide for crucial insights into many aspects of the dynamics , including confinement and dcsb , through mapping of the dressed quark mass function  @xcite and extractions of the quark distribution amplitudes for the @xmath0 states of different quantum numbers  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 program is one of the key cornerstones of the physics program in hall  b at jefferson laboratory ( jlab ) .",
    "the large acceptance spectrometer clas  @xcite was designed to measure photo- and electroproduction cross sections and spin observables over a broad kinematic range for a host of different exclusive reaction channels .",
    "consistent determination of @xmath0 properties from different exclusive channels with different couplings and non - resonant backgrounds offers model - independent support for the findings .",
    "to date photoproduction data sets from clas and elsewhere have been used extensively to constrain coupled - channel fits and advanced single - channel models .",
    "however , data at @xmath7=0 allows us to identify new states and determine their quantum numbers , but they tell us very little about the structure of these states .",
    "it is the @xmath7 dependence of the @xmath5 electrocouplings that reveals these details .",
    "in addition , electrocoupling data is promising for both spectrum and structure studies as the ratio of resonant to non - resonant amplitudes increases with increasing @xmath7 . finally , the electroproduction data are an effective tool to confirm the existence of new @xmath0 states as the data must be described by @xmath7-independent resonance masses and hadronic decay widths .",
    "the program goal is the study of the spectrum of @xmath0 states and their associated structure over a broad range of distance scales through studies of the @xmath7 dependence of the @xmath5 electrocouplings . for each final state",
    "this goal is realized employing two distinct phases .",
    "the first phase consists of the measurements of the experimental observables , cross sections and spin observables , in as fine a binning in the relevant kinematic variables ( @xmath7 , @xmath6 , @xmath14 ) as possible with the data .",
    "the second phase consists of developing advanced reaction models that fully describe the data in order to then extract the electrocoupling amplitudes for the dominant contributing @xmath0 states .",
    "electrocoupling amplitudes for most @xmath0 states below 1.8  gev have been extracted for the first time from analysis of clas data in the exclusive @xmath15 and @xmath16 channels for @xmath7 up to 5  gev@xmath8 , in @xmath17 for @xmath7 up to 4  gev@xmath8 , and for @xmath18 for @xmath7 up to 1.5  gev@xmath8 .     electrocoupling amplitudes of the @xmath19 ( left ) and @xmath20 ( right ) @xmath0 states from the analyses of the clas @xmath1 ( circles ) and @xmath21 ( triangles , squares ) data .",

    "studies of the electrocouplings for @xmath0 states of different quantum numbers at lower @xmath7 have revealed a very different interplay between the inner quark core and the meson - baryon cloud as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "structure studies of the low - lying @xmath0 states , e.g. @xmath25 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath26 , have made significant progress in recent years due to the agreement of results from independent analyses of the clas @xmath1 and @xmath21 final states @xcite .",
    "the good agreement of the extracted electrocouplings from both the @xmath1 and @xmath3 exclusive channels is non - trivial in that these channels have very different mechanisms for the non - resonant backgrounds .",

    "for higher @xmath7 , there is a gradual transition to the domain where the quark degrees of freedom just begin to dominate , as seen by the improved description of the @xmath0 electrocouplings obtained within the dse approach , which accounts only for the quark core contributions . for @xmath10  gev@xmath8",
    ", the quark degrees of freedom are expected to fully dominate the @xmath0 states  @xcite .",

    "in fact , data from the @xmath4 channels is critical to provide an independent extraction of the electrocoupling amplitudes for the higher - lying @xmath0 states .",
    "the clas program has yielded by far the most extensive and precise measurements of @xmath4 electroproduction data ever measured across the nucleon resonance region .",
