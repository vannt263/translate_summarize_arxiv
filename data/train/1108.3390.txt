    "the difference in scales between split supersymmetry and supersplit supersymmetry is due to the gaugino yukawa couplings to the higgs boson that counteract contributions from the electroweak gauge boson loops , allowing for a lower scale of supersymmetry breaking . with the higgs mass consistent with both split supersymmetry and supersplit supersymmetry , distinguishing these two scenarios",

    "these different regions have qualitatively different experimental confirmation prospect , ranging from optimistic in the case of the higgs resonance region to incredibly pessimistic for pure electroweakino dark matter .",

    "in addition to low scale uncertainties in extracting a prediction for the gluino lifetime , there are high scale uncertainties that substantially alter the predictions for the higgs mass @xcite .",
    "an increased accuracy of both the top mass and @xmath44 will shrink the low scale uncertainties . with a measurement of the gluino lifetime",

    "there is a wide range of gluino phenomenology that needs be explored .",

    "when the pair - produced gluinos decay , it gives events with multiple jets plus missing energy .",

    "if the heavy flavor analyses require compatibility with @xmath54-hadron decays , then these events will still be considered in unflavored jets plus missing energy searches because these searches do not exclude displaced vertices in their event selection criteria .    in split",

    "[ sec : gauginomassunification ] for details .",
    "for instance , it is possible to have a gluino that is lighter than the wino , though this is not a typical situation .",

    "that , simplified models have been proposed to capture such topologies in this region of phase space @xcite .",
    "fortunately , both atlas and cms are performing searches in jets and missing energy for simplified models where the gluino directly decays to the bino with an arbitrary spectrum @xcite .",
    "currently no results exist for simplified model searches where the gluino decays into a wino which subsequently decays into a bino . in @xcite ,",
    "the 1-step cascade decay causes a loss of @xmath57 in gluino mass reach for @xmath58 of integrated luminosity .    more generally , one of the primary reasons to assume gaugino mass unification is to avoid contributions to the gaugino masses from multiple susy breaking sources .",
    "when that happens , it is likely that physical phases are induced for the gaugino masses .",
    "normally , these phases give rise to unacceptably large cp violation , but with the squarks and sleptons decoupled to at least the @xmath15 scale , the cp problem is ameliorated .",
    "thus in split susy there should be no prejudice for gaugino mass unification .",
    "the incompatibility of displaced gluino decays with @xmath54-hadron decays is a striking handle that can be used to make jets and missing energy searches essentially background - free .",
    "the easiest manner to separate these events from standard heavy flavor jets is to require a substantial invariant mass for the secondary vertex .",
    "this will also remove any secondary interactions that give rise to displaced vertices since these are always low invariant mass vertices .",
    "to date no lhc search has been performed in jets plus missing energy with high mass displaced vertices .",
    "when gluino lifetimes become longer than @xmath59 , standard jet reconstruction starts failing .",
    "there has been work over the past several years to study extremely displaced vertices .",
    "these searches gain importance in light of the measurement of the higgs mass .",
    "the range from @xmath60 to @xmath61 in @xmath62 corresponds to a factor of 5 in scalar masses , @xmath63 , or equivalently the @xmath64 higgs mass range at large @xmath13 .",
    "recently , d0 looked for highly displaced jets in the range @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "this analysis required an additional muon not necessarily linked to the primary vertex .",
    "additional muons appear in the cascade decay of @xmath66 . with the assumptions that went into eq .",
    "[ eq : gluinopairsintomuons ] , there is a @xmath67 cost to require a hard muon in these events .",
    "atlas is currently studying jets with displaced vertices that are too distant from the interaction point to be reconstructed by standard tracking techniques .",
    "such tracks are sufficiently displaced that they are either not reconstructed at all or are not associated with the calorimetric activity to which they belong .",
    "this means that they can be interpreted as `` trackless jets . ''",
    "the results from these searches are not currently available , but they are promising in being sensitive to decays of gluinos with highly - displaced vertices .    in general , more effort is needed for this challenging range of gluino lifetimes to ensure that there is no loss in sensitivity to this promising region of the split susy parameter space .",

    "champs \" @xcite .",
    "the gluino does not carry any intrinsic electric charge , but instead can pick up a charge when it hadronizes and turns into an r - hadron .",
    "r - hadrons can be classified into r - mesons and r - baryons .",
    "gluinos are expected to fragment dominantly into r - mesons for similar reasons that more mesons than baryons are produced in jets .",
    "the number of champs depends upon whether there is a stable isotriplet r - meson , @xmath68 .",
    "if there is , then an @xmath69 fraction of produced gluinos will be champs that propagate from the interaction point , through the tracking and calorimetry , and finally leave through the muon chambers .",
    "alternatively , if there is no stable isotriplet r - meson because there is an isosinglet r - meson , @xmath70 , with mass @xmath71 then the r - mesons will promptly decay to the isosinglet r - meson and the r - hadron will not appear as a champ in the tracking chamber .",
    "there are still r - baryons that are in an isodoublet or higher representations of isospin , but these may make up only @xmath72 of r - hadrons , reducing the gluino mass reach by a factor of 2 .",
    "there is an uncertainty that arises because a quasi - stable gluino that hadronizes is unlike any other hadronic state in nature ",
    "it is a static color octet source .",
    "this means that there are no direct analogies to draw with low energy hadronic spectroscopy .",
    "taking a non - relativistic , constituent quark potential model , _ e.g. _ such as de rujula - georgi - glashow ( dgg ) @xcite , may not translate into these new scenarios .",
    "for instance , in dgg , the anomalously small mass for the pion arises from a large hyperfine splitting interaction . with a color octet source",
    ", there is a new way to hadronize  through gluons only .",
    "the potential picture for constituent quarks is already strained and translating it to a constituent gluon may be misleading .",
    "even if the lightest r - meson is an isosinglet , there is a matter induced process that converts r - mesons into r - baryons by picking up a baryon in the detector through the following reaction @xmath73 because the pion is anomalously light in qcd due to approximate chiral symmetry breaking , this reaction should be exothermic @xcite .",
    "thus , as r - mesons propagate through the detector , they transmute into r - baryons .",
    "r - baryons are charged and therefore can be champs .",
    "the dominant region of the detector where this transmutation takes place is in the calorimeters .",
    "thus the the way to see these converted r - mesons is as champs in the muon system , which is outside the calorimeter .",
    "the most sensitive current search is by cms @xcite with an integrated luminosity of @xmath74 .",
    "it places bounds on r - hadrons up to @xmath75 these limits eat up a small fraction of the parameter space for high susy breaking scale . by the end of the 7  tev run",
