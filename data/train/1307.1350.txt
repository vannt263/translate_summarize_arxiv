    "three - level atoms can appear in different configurations as @xmath0 , @xmath1 and v , what permits , for instance , the realization of population inversion and many applications in laser physics @xcite . by interacting with an one or two - mode optical field @xcite , three - level atoms can in some special regimes",
    "be effectivelly described as two - level systems with adiabatic elimination of the highest level in the cases of @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath1 @xcite configuration or the adiabatic elimination of the lowest level in the case of v configuration @xcite . in such situations ,",
    "the system dynamics can be exactly solved for the raman coupling with one or two modes of a quantized cavity electromagnetic field @xcite .    for a @xmath0 configuration ,",
    "a special case occurs when the two lower levels are degenerate . in the interaction with a single - mode optical field at far off - resonant and large detuning regimes the atomic states",
    "are reduced to a two - level system of degenerate states , characterizing a degenerate raman regime .",
    "this effective interaction leads in fact to an adequate description of the raman interaction in far off - resonant and large detuning regimes if compared to the full microscopic hamiltonian of the raman process @xcite , in the case of short evolving times and description of physical quantities only involving the square of amplitude probabilities @xcite .    from quantum optics ,",
    "the degenerate raman regime is well known , with important proposes of generation of non - classical states and protocols of quantum information derived from it .",
    "for instance , the generation of fock states @xcite , superpositions of coherent states @xcite , superpositions of phase states @xcite and generation of entangled coherent states @xcite . in quantum information ,",
    "protocols of quantum teleportation were proposed for unknown atomic states @xcite , unknown entangled coherent states @xcite and superpositions of coherent states @xcite .",
    "however , a quantum information transfer from atom to field state have not yet been proposed for degenerate raman regime .",
    "in fact , although the physics behind the atom - field entanglement is a well known process in this system @xcite , the step forward that can lead to the quantum transfer , i.e. , a hadamard gate for coherent state qubits , was only recently been proposed @xcite and experimentally achieved @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a quantum information transfer of an one - qubit state from an atom to a single mode field with a cavity initially in a coherent state .",
    "we first consider the atom - field interaction by degenerate raman regime , then a hadamard gate operation on the resulting coherent state qubit is realized , such that the state is lead to a qubit with the explict form of the atomic qubit .",
    "this propose has an advantage of realizing the quantum state transfer with a small number of operations .",
    "on the other hand , the requirement of coherent state qubit , a cat like state , makes use of recent developments in the coherent state quantum computing @xcite .",
    "these states formed by superpositions of coherent states are the closest to classical superpositions due to the minimum uncertainty relation of coherent states , related to the famous schrodinger s example of cat states @xcite .",
    "such states are , in fact , experimentally achievable , for instance , in electrodynamic cavities @xcite and systems of trapped ions @xcite .",
    "the main experimental difficult for the creation and the observation of such superpositions of coherent states is related to the fast decay of the coherences @xcite .",
    "advances in continuous variable quantum computation @xcite lead to the manipulation of such states as qubit states and the possibility of realizing gate operations @xcite , both theoretical and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the section ii we review the degenerate raman interaction between an atom and a coherent state . in the section iii",
    "we discuss the hadamard gate operation and the corresponding hadamard gate operation for coherent states to be used in our protocol . in the section iv",
    ", we propose the protocol quantum state transfer of coherent state qubits making using of the previous sections . finally , in the section",
    "v , we present our conclusions .",
    "we denote the three levels of the three - level rydberg atom of @xmath0-type by @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . due to the degeneracy ,",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 have same frequency @xmath5 .",
    "the frequency @xmath6 is associated to @xmath4 .",
    "the single - mode field is initially in a coherent state @xmath7 with frequency @xmath8 ( see figure [ gfr ] ) . under atom - field",
    "degenerate raman coupling the following relation is satisfied @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the detuning between the atomic transition ( @xmath11 ) and the single - mode frequency @xmath8 . in the case of large detuning , the upper state @xmath4 can be adiabatically eliminated @xcite .    in the case of large detuning ,",
    "short evolving times and physical quantities that only involve the square of the amplitude probabilities , the following effective hamiltonian can be considered ( @xmath12 ) @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the effective atom - field coupling , @xmath15 is the transition coupling from the lower states ( @xmath3 and @xmath2 ) to the upper state ( @xmath4 ) , @xmath16 is the number operator , @xmath17 and @xmath18 the creation and annihilation operators acting on the single - mode field .    retaining the stark shifts in the adiabatic elimination@xcite",
    "the hamiltonian term @xmath19 is included in the effective hamiltonian ( [ ef1 ] ) , where the stark parameters are equal to the effective atom - field coupling @xmath20 .",
    "we can then write the effective degenerate raman hamiltonian as @xcite @xmath21 for the single - mode field initially in the coherent state @xmath7 , the hamiltonian ( [ efs ] ) has validity when the following inequalities @xcite are satisfied @xmath22 and , @xmath23    the time evolution during a time @xmath24 of an initial state of an atom in a superposed state of the form @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and a field in a coherent state @xmath7 under the interaction ( [ efs ] ) is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 we can also write the state ( [ c ] ) as @xmath29 in the case @xmath30 , @xmath31 , corresponding to evolution of the state @xmath2 , we have @xmath32 and in the case @xmath33 , @xmath34 , corresponding to evolution of the state @xmath3 , we have @xmath35    notice that for this situation can also deal with approximatelly degenerate states , where the two frequency transitions associated to each state by the same optical field have similar transition frequencies . consequently , this scheme an exact degeneracy is not necessary , we can have @xmath36 , such that deviations can also be easily incorporated . since a small energy difference between the two lower atomic states is likely to be typical in experiments ,",
    "this situation where the states are approximatelly degenerates is of practical purpose .",
    "a hadamard gate operation is one case of one - gate operations and can be represented in matrix form by @xmath37 the action on states @xmath38 and @xmath39 leads respectivelly @xmath40 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are orthonormal states .    in the case of coherent states a quantum gate operation can be realized only approximatelly due to the non - orthonormality of these states , with assintotically negligible overlap .",
    "we consider a hadamard gate operation for coherent states , involving coherent states qubits of the type @xmath41 .",
    "this is a particular one - qubit gate operation involving coherent states descring the one case of following general process @xmath42 where @xmath43,@xmath44,@xmath45 , @xmath46 are complex numbers .",
    "note that taking into account the projection relations for coherent states @xcite , in the case of the states @xmath7 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 we can consider @xmath49 suficiently large and satisfying degenerate raman regime inequalities ( [ b ] ) and ( [ d ] ) , such that the states @xmath7 and @xmath47 are approximatelly orthonormal @xmath50 , a condition of negligible overlap . consequently , the system of coherent states can be described as a hilbert space formed by the states @xmath7 and @xmath47 .",
    "a hadamard gate operation can be represented by an operator @xmath51 in the hilbert space @xmath52 formed by the states @xmath7 and @xmath47 .",
    "its action on the qubit @xmath41 will result in a change in the coefficients of the superposition @xmath53 different from qubits formed from the atomic states , @xmath54 , or fock states , @xmath55 , for example , the qubit @xmath56 is not physically simple of being operated .",
    "indeed , these states are cat - like states and the gate operations in these states are a case of cat - like gate operations .    these cat state qubits of coherent states , due the uncertainties between amplitude and phase are the minimum allowed by the heisenberg s uncertainty principle in the case of coherent states @xcite .",
    "experiments for generation of superpositions of coherent states were proposed experimentally in both cavity qed @xcite and trapped ions @xcite .",
    "the difficulty for the creation and the observation of such superpositions is mainly due to the fast decay of the coherences @xcite . with the advances of the techniques for continuous variable quantum computation",
    ", the necessity of deal with such states as qubit states leads to the problem of one and more gate operations @xcite .",
    "the realization of gate operations in superpositions of coherent states was only recently achieved @xcite , what rises the possibilities of quantum gate operations on qubits of cat - like states and use them in quantum computation .    in our case ,",
    "the quantum gate operation on cat - like qubit will be of type @xmath57 as we will show in the next section , this is a hadamard type operation @xmath51 that can be written in the basis of coherent states @xmath7 and @xmath47 in the form @xmath58 due to negligible overlap , we can map the coherent state qubit in a qubit space and the hadamard gate can be represented in matrix form @xmath59",
    "now we propose a quantum state transfer protocol as as coming from two steps ( figure [ gfu ] ) : ( 1 ) in the first step , the degenerate raman interaction and an atomic detection are realized . in this step",
    ", we can consider the hadamard gate for coherent states operations as switched off .",
    "( 2 ) after the first step , we can switch on the gate operation for coherent states such that the process related to the manipulation of the coherent state qubit is achieved .",
    "let us start with the single - mode field initially in the coherent state @xmath7",
    ". at degenerate raman interaction regime , the upper level @xmath4 of the three level rydberg atom of @xmath0-type can be neglected , reducing the atomic system to a two - level state system . in this situation ,",
    "the atomic qubit state is described by @xmath60 where latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    single - mode field in the coherent state @xmath7 and the atomic state @xmath62 , eq.([atls ] ) , is given by the effective raman interaction described previoulsly , eq .",
    "( [ efs ] ) .",
    "we want to realize the transfer of the unknown coefficients @xmath63 and @xmath64 from the atom to the single - mode field in such a way that in the final step the atomic qubit is lead to a coherent state qubit with the same form of the atomic one , i.e. , carrying the coefficients @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "if the atom - field interaction occurs during a time @xmath24 , the system composed of atom - field evolves to the state @xmath65 where @xmath66 is given by ( [ cpm ] ) and @xmath67 is related to @xmath68 by means of @xmath69 an atomic detection then will project the field in a superposition of coherent states , leaving it in a cat - like state .",
    "if the measurement of the atom is realized into the state @xmath3 , the field is projected into the cat state latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    on the other hand , a measurement of the atom in the state @xmath2 will project the field into the cat state @xmath71 such that from ( [ time ] ) we have @xmath72 now , taking into account the projection relations for coherent states , equations ( [ c1 ] ) and ( [ c2 ] ) , and the condition of negligible overlap , @xmath50 , the states @xmath7 and @xmath47 are orthonormal and can be described as a hilbert space for a two - level system , generated by the coherent states @xmath7 and @xmath47 . in this situation , the atomic qubit can be stored as a coherent state qubit . and capable of storing the qubit state expressed by the atomic state ( [ atls ] ) .",
    "we note that the coeficients in ( [ finacod ] ) do not correspond to @xmath63 and @xmath64 , as in the initial atomic qubit , but are related to these by means of relations in ( [ cpm ] ) or the following @xmath73 for this reason , it is necessary the realization of an qubit gate operation for coherent states .",
    "indeed , a hadamard gate operation can be written in the basis of coherent states by means of @xmath74 where we drop the previous @xmath75 factor and consider just the linear action on the states . as a @xmath76-matrix",
    ", this operation can be written in terms of pauli matrices as a linear combination of @xmath77 and @xmath78 , by means of @xmath79 @xcite .    the quantum gate operation",

    "the action of the operator @xmath51 on the field @xmath83 leads the single mode field to the following state @xmath84 corresponding to a quantum information transfer when the atom is detected in the state @xmath3 . on the other hand , the action of @xmath51 on the field @xmath82 leads to the state @xmath85 corresponding to a quantum information transfer when the atom is detected in the state @xmath2 ( see figure [ gfrd23 ] ) .    in order to fix the coefficients , we can choose the previous selective atomic state detection to measure the atomic state in the ground state @xmath2 , such that the coherent state qubit has the form ( [ dasxz2 ] ) . consequently , this protocol is equivalent to a quantum state transfer of the state @xmath86 , that in our case goes from an atomic qubit state for a coherent state qubit , a cat - like qubit state .",
    "in conclusion , a quantum information transfer from atom to field state had not yet been proposed for degenerate raman regime .",
    "in fact , although the physics behind the atom - field entanglement it is a well known process @xcite , the step forward of a hadamard gate for coherent state qubits was only recently proposed @xcite and experimentally achieved @xcite , leading to the possibility of realize quantum computation with cat - like states .    here",
    "we have proposed a protocol of quantum transfer where the atom - field interacts in degenerate raman regime , a selective atomic detection of one of the degenerate states is realized and finally a hadamard gate operation for coherent states is applied in the coherent state qubit .",
    "this protocol is equivalent to a quantum state transfer of the state @xmath86 , that in our case goes from an atomic qubit state for a coherent state qubit , a cat - like qubit state . as such",
    ", it can make use of the recent advances in coherent state quantum computation .",
    "this scheme can also take into account approximatelly degenerate states , such that the two transitions frequences associated to each state by the same optical field have similar transition frequencies .",
    "consequently , an exact degeneracy is not necessary .",
    "since a small energy difference between the two lower atomic states is likely to be typical in experiments , this is of practical interest .",
    "independent of the final state in which the atom is detected , @xmath2 or @xmath3 , the action of the hadamard gate for coherent states @xmath51 on the resulting coherent state qubit leads to a complete quantum transfer of the atomic qubit coefficients @xmath63 and @xmath64 from the atom to the single - mode field",
    ". however , in order to avoid the statistical average that traces over the atom state resulting in a statistical mixture of the results on detection in the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we have to choose one state to realize the detection . by choosing the atomic selective detection on the state @xmath2",
    ", we can complete the quantum state transfer of the state @xmath86 , from the atomic qubit to the coherent state qubit .",
    "the experimental implementation of the atom - field entanglement is generally considered with the use of rydberg atoms of long lifetime and high-@xmath87 superconducting microwave cavities , where the dissipative processes are not relevant compared to the the atom - field interaction @xcite .",
    "the appropriate choices of @xmath15 and @xmath10 , of the order @xmath88 khz and @xmath89 khz , respectivelly , are sufficient for the condition of large detuning .",
