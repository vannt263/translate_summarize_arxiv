    "prior to any rigorous investigation of thermonuclear yields , mixing , rotation , mass loss , and other complex phenomena in the evolution of stars , it is necessary to insure that the methodology used can reproduce observations at the current state of the art .",
    "detached , double - lined eclipsing binaries provide the most accurate source of information on stellar masses and radii , and as such provide a crucial test for models of stellar evolution @xcite .",
    "the predictive power of such simulations depends upon the extent to which the validity of their oversimplifications can be tested .",
    "phenomenology is particularly pernicious in that good tests , which could give rise to falsification of the models and thus to progress , can be nullified by parameter adjustment ( `` calibration '' ) .",
    "similarly , the inclusion of new processes in the simulations is often contentious in that there may be several candidates put forward as the cause of the puzzling data .",
    "the treatment of the boundaries of convection zones ( `` overshooting '' ) is ripe for re - examination in terms of the underlying hydrodynamics @xcite . to aid this development ,",
    "we wish to understand just how well a standard convective treatment can do ( i.e. , we turn overshooting off ) . a more physically sound procedure will be presented subsequently .",
    "parameterized overshooting has been widely discussed ( see @xcite for an early discussion , and @xcite and @xcite for a recent ones with extensive references ) .",
    "rotation also may cause mixing @xcite . within the context of a plasma , rotation and convection",
    "may generate magnetic fields , which by their buoyancy and angular momentum transport may provide additional causes for mixing .",
    "this paper represents a first step toward testing our extensively revised stellar evolution and hydrodynamics code , tycho .",
    "our goals are ( 1 ) the understanding the predictive capability of stellar evolution theory by the critical re - evaluation of its assumptions , and of its underlying basis in observations and in laboratory data , ( 2 ) the examination of the tricky problem of mixing in stars to help design experiments @xcite and numerical tests @xcite , and ( 3 ) the development of an open source , publicly available stellar evolution code with modern capabilities for community use .",
    "the most comprehensive list of binary systems with accurately measured masses and radii is given in the review by @xcite .",
    "a subset of the original binaries was chosen for this exploratory effort .",
    "the systems with the smallest uncertainties were picked such that the range of masses from 23 to 1.1 @xmath0 was well sampled .",
    "the upper mass limit is the largest mass present in the data , while the lower limit is safely above the point at which the equation of state used in the modeling becomes inaccurate .",
    "this is primarily due to approximate treatment of coulomb contributions to the pressure ; we use only the weak screening limit for the plasma .",
    "the coulomb interaction leads to a negative pressure correction of @xmath3 8%  in the outer part of the convection region and @xmath3 1%  in the core for a star of 1 @xmath0 @xcite , and is less important for more massive stars .",
    "we obtain a comparable correction to the central pressure for a solar model ( -1.7% ) .    aside from the exclusion of stars of still lower mass ,",
    "no bias was applied in the selection process . for stars of @xmath4 or less ,",
    "the issue of possible overshooting in the convective core is moot because their cores are radiative .",
    "also , because they rotate rapidly only for a brief part of their lives , rotational mixing is expected to be less than for our selected stars .",
    "the binaries used in the study along with their fundamental parameters are presented in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "@xcite have revised the @xcite temperature estimates , and revised estimates for the masses of em car @xcite and cw cep @xcite have been presented .",
    "@xcite have revised the parameters for dm vir .",
    "all these changes are incorporated into table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "if the purpose of a stellar evolution code is to make testable predictions of the behavior of stars , then the adjustment of the mixing length by fitting stellar data is repugnant .",
    "alternatives are to constrain it by experiment or by simulation . at present we know of no definitive experimental results which determine the mixing length appropriate to stars , although a variety of experiments do test other aspects of stellar hydrodynamics and the codes used to simulate them @xcite .",
    "however , it is becoming possible to simulate turbulent , compressible convection with sufficient realism to constrain the range allowed for the mixing length @xcite .",
    "@xcite find a mixing length @xmath5 in units of pressure scale height ; this is based upon simulations having mesh resolutions as high as @xmath6 and corresponding rayleigh numbers as high as @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite based their work on resolutions up to @xmath8 , but with a more realistic treatment of radiative transfer and ionization .",
    "they were able to synthesize the line profile of feii @xmath95414 which compared well with that observed .",
    "their results agreed with standard 1-d models , although they suggest that this might be `` the right result for the wrong reason . ''",
    "standard models use @xmath10 to @xmath11 , which is significantly smaller than the value of @xcite . for a red giant , @xcite inferred @xmath12 , based upon 2-d simulations but with fairly realistic microphysics .",
    "@xcite have proposed a serious model to replace mixing length theory ; this has had the salutary effect of shifting the debate to the physics of convection and away from the best choice of mixing length . finally ,",
    "@xcite have shown from 2-d simulations that the underlying physical picture for stellar convection is incomplete , even in the deep interior where the complication of radiative transfer is minor .",
    "we simply choose @xmath12 , and look forward to the convergence of these efforts to provide a convection algorithm which is independent of stellar evolutionary calibrations .",
    "the evolutionary sequences were produced with the tycho stellar evolution code .",
    "the code was originally developed for one dimensional ( 1d ) hydrodynamics of the late stages of stellar evolution and core collapse @xcite .",
    "it is being completely rewritten as a general purpose , open source code for stellar evolution and hydrodynamics .",
    "the present version is written in structured fortran77 and is targeted for linux machines .",
    "it has been successfully ported to sunos and sgi irix operating systems .",
    "it has extensive online graphics using pgplot , an open source package written by t. j. pearson ( ) . a library of analysis programs is being built ( modules for apsidal motion , pulsational instability , reaction network links , and history of mass loss are now available ) .",
    "the code is being put under source code control to allow versioning ( this will allow particular versions of the code  for example the one used in this paper , to be resurrected accurately at later times ) , and to improve the reproducibility of results .",
    "knowledge of the radiative opacity of plasma at stellar conditions has changed qualitatively in the past decade .",
    "historically , solar and stellar atmospheres provided much of the empirical data on hot plasmas .",
    "for example , @xcite tabulates a range of effective temperatures from 2,000 to 200,000  k. these temperatures and the corresponding ( low ) densities characterized what was directly observable .",
    "higher temperatures could be found at lower densities ( in non - lte ) or indirectly inferred by use of theoretical models .",
    "terrestrial tests involved explosions which were difficult to quantify with adequate precision to determine opacity .",
    "measurements of opacity in a well characterized , hot , dense , laser - produced plasma have become possible @xcite . the first experiments to simultaneously quantify temperature and density with good precision @xcite involved temperatures @xmath13 and densities @xmath14 , which are directly relevant to stellar evolution and to apsidal motion .",
    "the range of conditions which are experimentally accessible is expanding with the development of new instruments and techniques . not only can direct measurements be made , but complex and sophisticated theories of the physical state of the plasma can be tested , giving more reliable extrapolations into conditions not yet experimentally accessible @xcite .",
    "the conditions just quoted are encountered in stars of about @xmath15 , and are important for stellar evolution ( see ch .  7 , @xcite ) .",
    "the opacities used here are from @xcite and @xcite , for a solar abundance pattern @xcite .",
    "the @xcite opacities were computed with 21 elemental species ; @xcite have shown that the remaining elements are so rare as to have only a marginal effect on the rosseland mean opacities ( for solar relative abundances of the heavier elements ) .",
    "while the opal opacities were constructed for astrophysical use , the underlying experiments and theoretical models are determined by the inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) community , reducing the danger of unconscious bias from astronomical puzzles leaking back into the construction of opacities .",
    "extension of the opacity library to lower temperatures and lower entropies is planned .",
    "tycho is designed to use an adaptable set of reaction networks ; for these calculations , two networks were used . at higher temperatures ( @xmath16 ) ,",
    "an 80 element reaction network was solved .",
    "the reaction rates were from f. k. thielemann ( private communication ) ; see also @xcite . for lower temperatures this was replaced by a 15 element network which was designed for deuterium , lithium , beryllium , and boron depletion .",
    "the reaction rates were from @xcite .",
    "the match at the temperature boundary was sufficiently good as to require no smoothing .",
    "more recent compilations of nuclear rates are available @xcite , but were not used here to simplify the comparison with previous work .",
    "the outer boundary condition was determined by use of the eddington approximation to a grey , plane parallel atmosphere , integrated in hydrostatic equilibrium inward to a fitting point for the interior .",
    "for the most extended model considered here , the ratio of mean free path to radius was @xmath17 , so that spherical effects are negligible .",
    "the most vigorous mass loss considered was so mild that the ram pressure @xmath18 at the photosphere was @xmath19 of the total thermal pressure , which is consistent with the hydrostatic assumption .",
    "such integrations were used to define the pressure and temperature at the fitting points , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , for the stellar luminosity @xmath22 and radius @xmath23 .",
    "their derivatives with respect to stellar luminosity and radius were approximated by finite differences constructed between three such integrations ( at @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ) .",
    "typically , of order 200 to 400 steps were used in the envelope integration .",
    "we used schwarzchild convection as formulated by @xcite , and our treatment of convective overshooting was turned off .",
    "mass loss was included and based on the theory of @xcite for @xmath27 and the empirical approach of @xcite for lower effective temperatures .",
    "r. kudritzki kindly provided appropriate subroutines for the hotter regime . even for em",
    "car , the most massive system in the list , the effects of mass loss were modest ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the equation of state was that discussed in @xcite , augmented by the solution of the ionization equilibrium equations for h , he , and a set of heavier elements scaled from the solar abundance pattern . both the equation of state and the thermonuclear reaction rates are affected by coulomb properties of the plasma . only weak screening was necessary here .",
    "extension to include both weak and strong screening consistently in the equation of state and thermonuclear reaction rates is planned ; previous versions of the code included strong screening as well .",
    "models were run for each mass , starting with a fully convective initial model on the hayashi track and ending well beyond hydrogen depletion in the core . a more realistic approach would have been to form the stars by accretion ( a. g. w. cameron , private communication ; @xcite ) .",
    "we justify our choice by its simplicity , and by noting that only the last stages of the pre - main sequence are relevant here , for which the two cases give similar results .",
    "zoning in the interior typically ranged from 200 to 500 zones .",
    "all runs had solar heavy element abundance @xcite and used a ratio of mixing length to scale height of @xmath29 for convection .",
    "this choice gave a reasonably good solar model when compared to @xcite and @xcite ; inclusion of element settling by diffusion and adjustment of the helium abundance would give improved consistency for the present - day sun , but diffusion would have less time to operate in the more massive stars considered here .",
    "rotational mixing was turned off .",
    "the stars are all at or near the main sequence , so that the possible list of citations is enormous ; the efforts of the padua group @xcite , the geneva group @xcite , and the franec group @xcite have comparable input physics and form a useful context .",
    "we focus discussion on @xcite and @xcite , who consider many of the same binaries , and @xcite who examined the apsidal motion test .",
    "the largest differences in microphysics between @xcite and this paper are our use of @xcite rather than @xcite opacities , a more realistic nuclear network , and a different approach to the equation of state , but none of this seems to be particularly significant for the issues here .",
    "we do include mass loss , but these effects are not large .",
    "@xcite do not calculate the pre - main sequence evolution ( which is relevant to several of our binaries ) .",
    "they define an overshooting parameter which is fixed by previous work on @xmath30 aurigae binaries @xcite .",
    "they construct a grid of models in mass ( 0.5 to @xmath31 ) and heavy element abundance ( @xmath32 , 0.02 and 0.03 ) , assuming @xmath33 and @xmath34 for the abundances of hydrogen and helium .",
    "they minimize a @xmath35 error estimator in four parameters : the masses @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the age @xmath38 of the binary , and @xmath39 the heavy element abundance .    as a test of consistency for later evolution",
    ", we have reproduced the @xmath40 and @xmath41 sequences of @xcite , which did not use overshooting .",
    "the notoriously sensitive blue loops were reproduced to graphical accuracy ( their figure 4 ) for the same input physics .",
    "the codes seem highly consistent .",
    "@xcite used the models of @xcite and @xcite , which use @xcite opacities and a 14 isotope network and include overshooting and mass loss .",
    "they too interpolated in a grid , minimizing a @xmath35 error estimator .",
    "this procedure was more complex than that used by @xcite , and need not be described here .",
    "both heavy element abundance and helium abundance were freely varied .",
    "our strategy differs from both @xcite and @xcite , which may provide a useful contrast .",
    "here we are interested in isolating the possible inadequacy of the standard formulation of stellar evolution , so we avoid optimization of parameters as much as possible . by using ( 1 ) solar abundances and ( 2 ) the measured masses , we reduce the degrees of freedom , and hopefully make the possible flaws in our stellar evolution prescriptions easier to see . by the same token , our models should fit the data less well because we have not optimized abundances or masses .",
    "mathematically , optimization will almost always improve the fit , but not necessarily for the correct reasons",
    ". however , the actual abundances may be different from our assumptions , and the masses do have error bars .",
    "@xcite used @xcite opacities , solar abundances , a mixing length ratio @xmath42 , and overshooting of @xmath43 pressure scale heights ( that is , essentially the same physics as the models used by @xcite ) , and computed structure constants for apsidal motion for seven of the binaries we consider ( em car , cw cep , qx car , u oph , @xmath30 phe , iq per , and pv cas ) .",
    "detailed comparisons will appear in the discussion below .",
    "the first step in comparing the binary data with the computations is the choice of the best models .",
    "this was done by examining a @xmath35 quantity for each binary pair , defined by @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the primary and the secondary star , respectively . here",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 are the observationally determined luminosity and radius of the primary , with @xmath49 and @xmath50 being the observational errors in @xmath51 and in @xmath52 .",
    "we convert the observational data for the radii to logarithmic form for consistency .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the luminosity and radius of the model .",
    "this @xmath35 was evaluated by computing two evolutionary sequences , one for a star of mass @xmath55 and one for @xmath56 , and storing selected results from each time step .",
    "then these files were marched through , calculating @xmath35 at consistent times ( @xmath57 to a fraction of a time step , which was a relative error of a few percent at worst ) .",
    "the smallest @xmath35 value determined which pair of models was optimum for that binary . note that if the trajectories of both @xmath45 and @xmath46 graze the error boxes at the same time , @xmath58 .",
    "these error parameters along with the corresponding uncertainties from the observations are presented in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "figure 1 displays the resulting @xmath35 for each binary pair , in order of descending mean mass .",
    "the binaries fall into three separate groups : ten have excellent fits ( @xmath59 ; em car , v478 cyg , cw cep , cv vel , u oph , pv cas , rs cha , pv pup , dm vir and ux men ) , six are marginal ( @xmath60 ; qx car,@xmath61 phe , iq per , my cyg , ek cep , and v1143 cyg ) , and two are poor fits ( @xmath62 , denoted _ offscale _ in figure 1 ; vv pyx and ai hya ) . the boundaries between these groups are indicated by vertical lines .",
    "the weakness of a @xmath35 measure is that it is most meaningful if the errors have a gaussian distribution around the mean ( @xcite , chapters 14 and 15 ) , which does not seem to be the case here .",
    "in particular , systematic shifts in the empirical data , due to new analyses , can give significant shifts in the error estimation .",
    "@xcite have re - estimated the effective temperatures of 13 of the 18 binaries we have examined .",
    "five ( qx car , u oph , pv cas , ai hya , and rs cha ) were changed by more than twice the error estimates of either @xcite or @xcite .",
    "further , @xcite and @xcite have analyzed additional data ( from iue ) and find masses of cw cep and em car which lie beyond twice the error estimates .",
    "this is to be expected if the errors are dominated by systematic effects , and warns us to distrust all but our most robust inferences .    because the fractional errors in mass and in radius are much more restrictive",
    ", it strongly supports the need for renewed efforts to pin down the effective temperatures of these stars .",
    "the choice of @xmath22 and @xmath23 rather than @xmath22 and @xmath63 in our definition of @xmath35 is significant : the smaller errors for @xmath23 make the @xmath35 more discriminating .",
    "@xcite use @xmath23 and @xmath63 which has the slight advantage here of involving less propagation of observational errors , but because @xmath23 is much more precise than @xmath63 , the effect is small for the present data .",
    "we have chosen to update the original data of @xcite , incorporating the changes made by the @xcite effective temperatures and the @xcite and @xcite masses .",
    "we have used the new data for dm vir @xcite .",
    "our general conclusions are unaffected by which of these sets of data we use .",
    "the comparison of observed and computed stars may be presented as an goodness of fit vector , which has the advantage of being directly representable in the hr diagram for the stars .",
    "the observed points with error bars are plotted along with an arrow indicating the distance and direction to the best model point .",
    "the way in which the models differ from the observations can then be taken in at a glance .",
    "figure 2 shows the goodness of fit vectors , from the observed points ( shown with error bars ) to the best model star ( chosen as described above ) .",
    "the largest discrepancy is the secondary of vv pyx .",
    "of the eight binaries ( qx car , @xmath30 phe , iq per , vv pyx , ai hya , ek cep , my cyg , v1143 ) which have mediocre or poor fits , seven ( qx car is the exception ) have at least one component lying in the range @xmath64 .",
    "@xcite noticed similar behavior .",
    "figure 3 shows the luminosity differences between the models and the stars .",
    "the vertical axis is mass in solar units ; binary components are connected by a line .",
    "the two binaries with @xmath62 ( vv pyx and ai hya ) are denoted by crosses ; they are poor fits and should be given little weight .",
    "considering the best fits , @xmath59 ( solid squares ) , there is a dramatic trend : the highest mass models ( for example , em car ) are underluminous relative to the actual binaries , while the lower mass models are not .    given the indications that the errors may be dominated by systematic effects , we approach a statistical discussion with caution .",
    "the two binaries which have @xmath62 are eliminated from this statistical discussion on the basis that these fits are too poor to be meaningful . in principle",
    ", the mean errors could show a systematic shift in the models relative to the data , but because we choose an optimum pair of models , the choice masks any absolute shift .",
    "the error should reappear as a larger rms difference .",
    "for luminosity , the first moment of the difference between model and stellar logarithmic luminosity is just the mean of this difference , which is @xmath65 in the base ten logarithm ( the models are too dim by this amount ) .",
    "the shift is smaller than the rms error of the observational data , which is 0.056 .",
    "if there were a bad global mismatch , the rms difference in `` model minus star '' would be much larger than the average error in the observations .",
    "however , the rms difference between the models and stars is 0.054 , which is almost the same as the observational error .",
    "the luminosity is basically a measure of the leakage time for radiation , which is dominated by the value of the opacity in the radiative regions .",
    "it samples the whole star , including the deep interior . in a global sense",
    ", our mean leakage rate seems correct to the level of the statistical and observational error .",
    "the shifts in radius between the models and the stars are shown in figure 4 . the vertical axis and the symbols are the same as in the previous figure .",
    "the mean shift is 0.0053 in the logarithm ( the models are too large by this small amount ) ; the corresponding standard error of the andersen data for which the fits are acceptable is 0.016 , to be compared with an rms differnce between models and stars of 0.014 . except for a few outlying cases ,",
    "the distribution is fairly uniformly distributed around zero .",
    "if only the best fits ( squares ) are considered , a subtle trend might be inferred : 9 of 12 of the models above @xmath66 have radii which are too large .",
    "the corresponding mean shift in @xmath67 is @xmath68 ( the models are too cool by this amount ) .",
    "again , this is small in comparison to the standard error of the observations ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the corresponding rms difference between models and stars is @xmath70 .",
    "the effective temperature is a surface quantity , and is more sensitive to the outer layers which contain little of the stellar mass .",
    "these numbers suggest that standard stellar evolutionary sequences of these stages should be able to produce luminosities , radii , and effective temperatures within 11 , 3 and 4 percent , respectively , of good observational data .",
    "otherwise , new physics is indicated .",
    "because the standard stellar evolutionary models do this well , small `` improvements '' may contain no information .",
    "we will emphasize systematic trends , and those implications which emerge from several independent tests .",
    ".,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    figure 5 shows the evolution of the model stars in log luminosity and log radius , for em car , v478 cyg , cw cep , qx car , cv vel , and u oph , corresponding to a mass range from 23 to 4.6 @xmath71 . except for qx car ( @xmath72 ) , models of these binaries",
    "have @xmath59 , and so represent good fits .",
    "the error bars are centered on the observed stars ; the arrows point from them to the optimum models .",
    "notice the the fits can be multivalued because the trajectories may pass through the error boxes multiple times .",
    "this is shown occurring first as the model descends from the pre - main sequence ( pre - ms ) , and again during main sequence hydrogen burning .",
    "if the stellar masses are significantly different , this ambiguity is removed by the condition that both components have the same age .",
    "all the model stars are too dim ( all the arrows point downward ) , a signal that the standard stellar evolution prescription is systematically wrong .    em car , being the most massive system , also has the most significant mass loss .",
    "the model evolutionary sequences are set by the choice of initial mass , but the observational constraint on mass is applied after the best fitting model is determined .",
    "this is an implicit function of the choice of initial mass , and iteration is required .",
    "initial masses of 22.91 and 20.91 produce masses at fit of 22.25 and 20.12 @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "this mass ratio of 0.904 is consistent with the observational value of @xmath73 @xcite , and the masses agree with observation to within the estimated errors ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "however , even this loss is still small .",
    "a loss of @xmath75 is about twice the uncertainty in mass determination , @xmath76 .",
    "such a change in mass , since @xmath77 , corresponds to a shift in luminosity of @xmath78 , to be compared to the observational error in luminosity of @xmath79 , which is still larger .",
    "this is due to the fact that effective temperature is less well determined than the radius .",
    "a concentrated effort to refine the effective temperature determinations for em car , v478 cyg , cw cep , qx car , cv vel , and u oph would translate directly into much sharper constraints on massive star evolution .",
    "@xcite have revised the effective temperature for qx car ( upward ) by twice the quoted error , so that the inferred luminosity increases . prior to this revision ,",
    "the fit to qx car was good ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "this larger discrepancy for qx car is in the same sense as noted for the other massive systems ; the models are dimmer than the stars . taking the larger masses from @xcite , with or without mass loss ,",
    "still gives good fits , and the models are still dimmer than the stars .",
    "the result seems robust .",
    "@xcite have used high resolution spectral images obtained with the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) to study the winds from cw cephei ( hd 218066 ) .",
    "they place upper limits on the mass - loss rates of @xmath80 for the primary and @xmath81 for the secondary .",
    "the model masses start at 12.9 and 11.9 and decrease only to 12.8 and 11.88 respectively , to be compared to @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "the mass loss predicted by the @xcite theory for our models at the point of minimum error is @xmath84 for the primary , and @xmath85 for the secondary .",
    "if the upper limits were detections , this could be considered good agreement , considering the complexity of the problem of interpreting the system @xcite .",
    "the net loss of mass up to this point is no larger than the error in mass determination , @xmath86 .",
    "because the mass loss rate is restricted by these observations to be at or below the value we use , the mass loss process should have no larger effect than we compute .",
    "hence , the remaining discrepancy must come from some other effect .",
    "table  [ tbl-3 ] gives the instantaneous mass loss rates from the models , at the point of optimum fit , for the most massive binary systems .",
    "at lower masses , the mass loss rates are smaller still .",
    "additional observational data on mass loss for these systems could prove crucial in clarifying the role of mass loss in stellar evolution .",
    "@xcite estimate ages for em car and cw cep .",
    "their procedure not only gives ages , but also error estimates for those ages .",
    "our ages agree with theirs to within these errors , even though we use no overshooting and they do . it may be that the convective region in high mass stars is sufficiently large that the gross evolutionary properties of stars on the main sequence are not greatly affected by the overshooting correction .",
    "the understanding of the physics of overshooting is still too preliminary to do more than speculate on this issue .",
    "@xcite find acceptable fits for em car , v478 cyg , cw cep , qx car , and u oph ( it is probable that qx car would not have been a good fit with the revised effective temperatures ) , but with increasingly lower heavy element abundances with increasing mass .",
    "em car and v478 cyg have fits at the limit of the heavy element abundance range .",
    "@xcite find a similar effect : the heavy element abundances of their massive binaries are marginally smaller than those of the less massive ones .",
    "their effect is not quite as obvious as in @xcite , perhaps because @xcite do not force the helium abundance to correlate with heavy element abundance , and it fluctuates for these systems .",
    "the added degree of freedom may allow the fitting procedure to obscure the trend .",
    "this behavior could be interpreted as a galactic evolutionary effect , which would be extremely interesting , but there is another possibility .",
    "the problem with the massive models ( see figure 2 and figure 3 ) is that they are too dim .",
    "lower heavy element abundance gives higher luminosity because of reduced opacity .",
    "the fitting algorithms , having little freedom for mass variation ( thanks to the high quality of the data ) , must find lower heavy element abundance preferable , whether or not the heavy element abundances are actually smaller .",
    "more effective mixing , giving larger cores , also results in higher luminosities even if the abundances are unchanged .",
    "_ it is crucial to obtain spectroscopic information to decide the issue . _",
    "@xcite have recently examined v380 cyg , which is a binary of disparate masses ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) and evolutionary state .",
    "they conclude that more mixing is needed ( @xmath89 )",
    ". however , this system is complicated .",
    "guinan et al .",
    "estimate that the system is approximately ten thousand years from roche lobe overflow by the primary .",
    "thus , conclusions based on this system should be made with caution .",
    "the overshoot parameter @xmath2 may be a function of mass ( at least ) .",
    "similar behavior can also be seen in @xcite , which finds different values of the best fit overshoot parameter for five different masses . alternatively , rotational mixing might be increasingly effective for larger masses .",

    "consequently , small changes may improve the @xmath35 significantly , even if they do not correspond to the physics of the system . in the case of iq per , use of the @xcite value of effective temperature",

    "ai hydrae is particularly interesting because the primary is fitted by a model which is swiftly evolving , so that catching it in such a stage is unlikely .",
    "overshoot from the convective core would broaden the main sequence band and increase the age of the fast evolving primary , allowing the possibility of a fit with a more probable , slower evolutionary stage .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusions of @xcite , who find that ai hya is the only binary for which the overshooting models give a greatly improved fit .",
    "some of the ai hya behavior can be attributed to heavy element abundance effects .",

    "the heavy element abundance of this system ( from multi - color photometry ) is 0.07 @xcite , which is 3.5 times the value used in the models .",
    "the true interior composition can not be this metal rich .",
    "we have examined a sequence which had a heavy element abundance of 0.03 rather than 0.02 .",
    "this modest change gave a dramatic shift toward lower luminosity ( @xmath92 , which is three times the observational error ) and cooler effective temperatures ( @xmath93 , which is also three times the observational error ) .",
    "however , if the heavy element abundance were high only near the surface of the star , the opacity effects would produce a shift to the red in the evolutionary tracks , which would bring the models much more in line with the observations .",

    "they track the same path at essentially the same time .",

    "rs cha has previously been suggested to be in a pre - main sequence stage @xcite .",
    "the pre - ms identification would have important theoretical implications .",
    "if true , it implies that the error in the models occurs after the core convection has been established in these stars . in any case , convection is an interesting possible cause for the problem ; these binaries have at least one component with convective core burning .",
    "pv cas has sufficiently different masses to require us to examine the pre - ms fit seriously .",
    "questions have been raised about the evolutionary status of pv cas since @xcite .",
    "previous attempts to fit the system to main sequence models @xcite have been unsatisfactory , mainly due to a large and irreconcilable age discrepancy between the members .",
    "fitting both components to pre - ms models , however , produces excellent agreement .",
    "to test the case for pv cas being pre - ms , we looked for other observation clues .",
    "the double - lined eclipsing binary system rs cha was recently found by @xcite to be pre - ms .",
    "not only were pre - ms tracks for rs cha a better fit than post - ms tracks , but two other observations strengthened the argument : ( 1 ) rs cha had several nearby _ rosat _ all - sky survey x - ray sources nearby which were found to be very young , low - mass , weak - lined t tauri stars , and ( 2 ) rs cha s proper motion matched that of the t tauri stars , suggesting a genetic tie .",
    "pv cas is at a distance of 660 pc @xcite , and a young stellar aggregate or membership within an ob association could have been previously overlooked .",
    "searching the hipparcos and tycho-2 catalogs , as well as examining pv cas on the digitized sky survey , we found no evidence for pv cas being a member of a known ob association .",
    "more massive members of a putative association would be included in the hipparcos catalog with proper motions similar to that given in the tycho-2 entry for pv cas , but none were found .",
    "we searched for known groups of young stars with vizier at cds : the compilations of ob associations by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and open clusters by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the only possible known associations that pv cas could belong to are cep ob3 ( d=840 pc , @xmath95 ) and cep ob2 ( d=615 pc , @xmath96 ) , however their projected separations from pv cas are large ( 600 pc and 100 pc , respectively ) , and their average radial velocities are far from popper s value for pv cas ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "hence , pv cas does not appear to be connected to any known ob associations or clusters which help us to infer its nature .",
    "the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) bright source catalog ( bsc ; @xcite ) and faint source catalog ( fsc ; @xcite ) were searched to see whether there was any evidence for a clustering of x - ray - emitting t tauri stars in the vicinity of pv cas .",
    "no concentration of sources near pv cas was detected , although the sensitivity of rass at 660 pc is about l@xmath98 @xmath99 10@xmath100 erg  s@xmath101 , corresponding to the very high end of the x - ray luminosity function for t tauri stars @xcite .",
    "only one rass - bsc source was within 30  ( @xmath36 pc projected ) of pv cas , but its f@xmath102/f@xmath103 ratio was 2 magnitudes too high to be a plausible t tauri star candidate .",
    "the only rass - fsc source within 30  of pv cas appeared to be related to a galaxy cluster on the digitized sky survey .",
    "we conclude that we currently have no evidence for a pre - ms aggregate around pv cas which could strengthen the argument for its pre - ms status . however , the taurus clouds also are forming low mass pre - ms stars without high mass cluster counterparts .",
