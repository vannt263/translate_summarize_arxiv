    "it has now been 75 years since hans bethe published his seminal paper @xcite constructing the eigenfunctions of the spin-@xmath0 heisenberg chain @xcite , @xmath1 giving birth to the bethe ansatz and paving the way for the modern theory of integrable models of quantum mechanics and field theory @xcite .",
    "interest in the heisenberg model has only increased since those early days , partly because of the extremely rich mathematical structures now known to be associated to it , but also because of its ability to accurately describe a number of real compounds .",
    "the bethe ansatz is first and foremost a method giving access to an integrable system s energy levels , allowing the calculation of many equilibrium quantities . for the specific case of the heisenberg model ,",
    "the ground state energy of the infinite chain was computed analytically @xcite not long after bethe s paper , but it was not until the 1960 s that significant new results were obtained : its excitation spectrum was computed by des cloizeaux and pearson @xcite , and its more general thermodynamic properties were obtained shortly afterwards @xcite .",
    "equilibrium quantities are however not sufficient to completely characterize the physics of models such as ( [ xxx ] ) .",
    "motivated mainly by experimental work , another object of fundamental importance has been extensively studied : the dynamical structure factor ( dsf ) @xmath2 this quantity is directly accessible experimentally through inelastic neutron scattering @xcite , and its theoretical calculation opens the door to the interpretation of a wealth of experimental data .    despite much effort ,",
    "the dynamics of integrable models remains in general inaccessible , and exact calculations based on the bethe ansatz can only rarely be carried out .",
    "one reason is that excitations are usually rather complicated : for the heisenberg model , the hilbert space can be spanned with spinons @xcite , which are nontrivially interacting spin-@xmath0 particles whose dispersion relation is given by @xmath3 .",
    "\\label{spinon_disp_rel}\\ ] ] the computation of dynamical quantities such as the structure factor however requires knowledge of matrix elements of spin operators between ( multi-)spinon states , which goes much beyond what is accessible with the basic bethe ansatz .    in view of the difficulty of this task , a number of approximate schemes have been put forward to offer a qualitative picture of the dsf .",
    "one extremely useful construction is known as the mller ansatz @xcite , which is based on exact results for the @xmath4 model , numerical computations on small chains and known sum rules .",
    "its success lies in its extreme simplicity , coupled with rather accurate reproduction of a number of features ( like the square - root singularity at the lower threshold ) .",
    "it is commonly used in the interpretation of experimental data .",
    "it drawback is that it is inexact ; in particular , its functional form at the top of the 2-spinon continuum is not correct .",
    "another important and successful approach relies on mapping the infinite chain onto a relativistic quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "finite size scaling connects the critial exponents of the system with its behaviour in a finite volume @xcite , while conformal field theory @xcite and bosonization allow the calculation of asymptotics of correlation functions @xcite even at finite temperatures , with known normalizations for the first few leading terms in the operator expansion @xcite .",
    "as far as methods based on integrability are concerned , it is now possible to achieve extremely accurate computations of the dsf over the whole brillouin zone @xcite for integrable heisenberg spin chains of any anisotropy in any magnetic field , using the abacus method @xcite .",
    "these computations rely on determinant representations for matrix elements of local spin operators obtained by solving the quantum inverse problem @xcite , and are therefore limited to finite ( albeit large ) chains .",
    "we here wish however to concentrate on an altogether different and independent take on the problem of calculating the dsf of the heisenberg model , which is not applicable in general but only in one particular ( albeit extremely important ) case .    the crucial development (",
    "as far as the subject of the present paper is concerned ) came with the recognition that the infinite chain in zero magnetic field displayed a quantum affine symmetry , allowing the diagonalization of the hamiltonian directly in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "multi - spinon states then provide a basis for the hilbert space and a resolution of the identity operator , allowing to write the dsf as a sum of matrix elements of local spin operators .",
    "these matrix elements can be computed within this framework through bosonization of the quantum affine algebra @xcite , a task performed by jimbo and miwa @xcite .",
    "the general representation of such correlation functions as the dsf is then obtained in terms of rather complicated contour integrals , the number of integrals increasing with the number of spinons in the excited state .",
    "these are however notoriously hard to evaluate quantitatively .",
    "one exception is the contribution to the transverse zero - temperature dsf of the heisenberg model coming from 2-spinon intermediate states , the simplest excitations that can be constructed above the ground state . in this case , the dynamical constraints of conservation of energy and momentum give two @xmath5 functions taking care of the two contour integrals involved , allowing for a direct analytical calculation @xcite ( a similar calculation is also possible in the whole gapped antiferromagnetic phase @xcite ) .",
    "these 2-spinon intermediate states were shown to contribute @xmath6 of the total structure factor intensity @xcite .",
    "the missing part is then necessarily carried by excited states with a higher number of spinons , starting with 4-spinon states .",
    "the integral representations for matrix elements involving 4-spinon states are much more difficult to tackle , since the dynamical constraints are not sufficient to take care of all the contour integrals involved ( this is also true for the longitudinal structure factor of the @xmath7 model , which was studied in the ising limit in @xcite ) . the first attempt to tackle more than two spinons",
    "was made in @xcite , offering a formal representation for the exact @xmath8-spinon contribution for the zero - temperature dsf of the heisenberg model in zero field .",
    "a more thorough treatment of the four - spinon case was published shortly afterwards @xcite , yielding expressions for the dsf in the whole gapped antiferromagnetic regime , and their specialization to the ising and heisenberg limits .",
    "these expressions remained however quite complicated , giving the four - spinon part at fixed momentum and energy in terms of a double integral of an infinite series .",
    "further analytical work @xcite yielded little progress , and in fact ( as we will show below ) incorrectly identified the boundaries of the four - spinon continuum .",
    "to this day , nobody has been able to extract curves from these expressions , and previous attempts @xcite have not yielded acceptable results due to the inappropriateness of the chosen method and the incorrect continuum used .",
    "the present paper offers the first reliable computation of the exact 4-spinon contribution to the zero - temperature dynamical structure factor of the heisenberg isotropic antiferromagnet in zero magnetic field . after summarizing results for the matrix elements which we need for our purposes ,",
    "the known 2-spinon results are repeated as a warmup , after which we present their extension to the case of four spinons ( correcting some factors in the formulas present in the literature ) .",
    "we finish by a discussion of our results , in particular concerning contributions to sum rules .",
    "the inevitable first step in the calculation of the dsf ( [ s_k_omega ] ) is to insert a resolution of the identity in a judiciously chosen basis between the two spin operators . for the @xmath7 model in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", a basis for the hilbert space is provided by ( multi- ) spinon states @xmath9 , which diagonalize the hamiltonian according to @xmath10 labels the two equivalent vacuum states @xmath11 , @xmath12 corresponding to the two different possible boundary conditions , and @xmath13 labels the spin projection of the spinons .",
    "the coefficients @xmath14 are spectral parameters determining the energy and momenta of the spinons .",
    "the completeness relation reads @xmath15 and can be substituted in ( [ s_k_omega ] ) to yield the decomposition of the dsf into a sum over ( even numbers of ) spinon contributions ( here and in the following , we make use of spin isotropy and compute @xmath16 ) @xmath17 each term in this decomposition is explicitly written as @xmath18 the matrix elements of local spin operators in the above expression are represented exactly within the framework of jimbo and miwa @xcite .",
    "their adaptation to the isotropic heisenberg antiferromagnet was given in @xcite for 2-spinon intermediate states , and in @xcite for @xmath19 , although the expressions obtained there are not thoroughly simplified .",
    "for 4-spinon intermediate states , the matrix elements were studied more extensively in @xcite , whose results will form the basis of the new results we obtain .",
    "let us however start by briefly reminding the reader of known results on the much simpler case of 2-spinon intermediate states .",
    "it is well - known that 2-spinon intermediate states live within a continuum in @xmath20 defined by satisfying the kinematic constraints of momentum and energy conservation , @xmath21 in other words , for a fixed external momentum , there exists an interval in frequency given by the conditions @xmath22 .",
    "\\label{2p_continuum}\\ ] ] the lower boundary is thus given by the des cloizeaux - pearson dispersion relation .",
    "the 2-spinon part of the dsf will be nonvanishing within this continuum , and will by construction vanish identically outside of it .",
    "this contribution was obtained in @xcite and is explicitly written as @xmath23 the parameter @xmath24 is defined as @xmath25 and the nontrivial part of the dsf is encoded in the fundamental integral function @xmath26    a careful study of this representation of the 2-spinon dsf was carried out in @xcite , and it is worthwhile to remind the reader of some important facts obtained there .",
    "first of all , at the lower boundary ( for @xmath27 ) , the 2-spinon dsf diverges as a square root accompanied by a logarithmic correction , @xmath28 ( for @xmath29 , the divergence is @xmath30 ) .",
    "near the upper boundary , on the other hand , the 2-spinon dsf vanishes in a square - root cusp , @xmath31 .",
    "second , sum rules were also studied , most importantly the contribution to the total integrated intensity @xmath32 and to the exactly known first frequency moment at fixed momentum , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the ground - state energy density @xcite .",
    "2-spinon intermediate states were shown to carry @xmath6 of the total intensity , and @xmath35 of the first moment sum rule ( independently of @xmath36 ) .",
    "more than a quarter of the exact dsf is therefore missing if we restrict ourselves to only two spinons . to achieve better saturation of the sum rules , we need to go to more complicated intermediate states involving more particles , and we can safely expect that out of those , 4-spinon states will be dominant .",
    "starting from the results of @xcite , we write the exact representation for the 4-spinon part of the dsf as @xmath37 where the prefactor is @xmath38 with @xmath39)}{\\sinh ( 2 t ) \\cosh t}\\right).\\ ] ] here again , we restrict to @xmath40 $ ] . parametrizing the momenta as @xmath41 the correlation weight",
    "is explicitly given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "the function @xmath44 is given by equation ( [ i_rho ] ) , whereas @xmath45 is given by the following expression : @xmath46 where the heaviside function is here defined as @xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "we have corrected two inaccuracies in @xcite : first , the correct normalization is presented here ( compare ( [ g_l ] ) with formula ( 5.10 ) there ) , and most importantly , we have explicitly written that the momentum @xmath5 function fixes @xmath36 only modulo @xmath51 .",
    "this has the crucial consequence that two sectors must be considered when solving the dynamical constraints of momentum and energy conservation for 4-spinon intermediate states ( this was overlooked in @xcite , leading in particular to an incorrect description of the four - spinon continuum ) .",
    "bearing in mind that the spinon momenta @xmath52 are by definition constrained to the interval @xmath53 $ ] , we define sectors 0 and 1 as @xmath54 with in both cases the energy constraint explicitly written as @xmath55 for higher spinon numbers , more sectors must be similarly added : there are @xmath8 such sectors for states with @xmath56 spinons .",
    "a more physical representation of the four - spinon part ( [ s_4_1 ] ) of the structure factor is obtained by the change of variables @xmath57 where @xmath58 in sector 0 , we then have @xmath59 the complete transformation reads @xmath60 where we restrict to @xmath61 and @xmath62 by symmetry .",
    "this sector corresponds to @xmath63 $ ] .    in sector 1 , we have @xmath64 instead of the left of ( [ komega_s0 ] ) , yielding the same expressions for @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and @xmath67 with the same restrictions as above .",
    "this sector corresponds to @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "the 4-spinon continuum in the @xmath20 plane is obtained by letting @xmath69 and @xmath70 take on all their allowed values . the lower boundary coincides with that of the 2-spinon continuum ( the des cloizeaux - pearson dispersion relation",
    "; this is clearly the case from a simple physical argument , namely that we are dealing with a massless theory , and therefore adding two more spinons of zero momentum in the intermediate state does not shift the energy ; in fact , the lower boundary of _ any _ finite higher spinon number continuum is identical to the 2-spinon one ) .",
    "the upper boundary , on the other hand , extends above the upper boundary of the 2-spinon continuum , and is obtained by sharing the momentum ( modulo @xmath51 ) evenly among the four spinons .",
    "explicitly , we therefore have @xmath71 a geometrical picture of the @xmath56 spinon continuum is easily obtained by generalization : the lower boundary will always be given by the des cloizeaux - pearson dispersion relation , whereas the upper boundary will be given by the upper boundary of a 2-spinon continuum rescaled in size by a factor of @xmath8 , modulo all its @xmath51 translations ( refer to figure [ branch_fig ] for the simplest case of 4 spinons ) .    for the implementation of the computation of the 4-spinon part of the structure factor , it is desirable to describe more carefully the actual integration regions for @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which can be precisely defined for given @xmath40 $ ] and @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "simple reasoning shows that the @xmath73 integration regions are obtained by intersecting two separate 2-spinon continua , one upright and the other inverted in frequency , and shifted with respect to each other by @xmath36 in momentum and @xmath74 in frequency ( this is illustrated in figure [ kw_int_reg ] ) .",
    "the important line crossings are respectively of the @xmath75 lines ( upper boundaries ) of the two continua , and of their @xmath76 lines . the first determine which intervals of @xmath69",
    "should be included , and the second determine which sub - intervals within these should be excluded .",

    "the value of @xmath70 is restricted to a finite interval : @xmath83 with the limits being explicitly given by @xmath84 the leftover two - dimensional integral for the 4-spinon part of the dsf is therefore over a region with nontrivial geometry , depending on the particular values of @xmath36 and @xmath74 . within the 4-spinon continuum , we can identify six sectors ( illustrated in figure [ branch_fig ] ) , each of which leads to a different sort of integration domain in the @xmath69 , @xmath70 plane ( examples of which are illustrated in figure [ calimeros ] ) . by symmetry",

    "in conclusion , we have calculated the 4-spinon contribution to the zero - temperature dynamical structure factor of the heisenberg model in zero magnetic field , starting from its exact integral representation in the thermodynamic limit . as proven by sum rules , this contribution carries most of the correlation weight left over after 2-spinon intermediate states have been taken into accout . the results",
