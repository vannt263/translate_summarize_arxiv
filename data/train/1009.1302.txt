    "quantum zakharov equations ( qzes ) @xcite describe the nonlinear interaction of high - frequency ( hf ) quantum langmuir waves ( qlws ) and the low - frequency ( lf ) quantum ion - acoustic waves ( qiaws ) in quantum plasmas .",
    "this set of equations basically extends the classical zakharov equations ( czes ) @xcite with higher - order dispersive terms associated with the bohm potential . unlike czes , qzes have been deduced using a quantum fluid model  under  the similar quasineutral assumption and the multiple time scale technique .",
    "recently , much attention has been paid to investigate the dynamics of qzes  in the context of e.g. , the formation of langmuir solitons through modulational instability ( mi ) as well as langmuir turbulence through the process of chaos ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the statistical properties of the qzes have been analyzed using kinetic treatment and to show that the quantum coupling parameter ( @xmath0 ) can be responsible for reducing the mi growth rate @xcite .",
    "the latter is , however , shown to be maximized in the limit of @xmath1 .",
    "a variational approach was conducted to study the quantum effects on localized solitary structures @xcite .",
    "moreover , some general periodic solution using lie point symmetries @xcite , some exact solutions @xcite as well as both temporal @xcite and spatiotemporal dynamics @xcite in the context of chaos and langmuir turbulence  of the qzes have been investigated in the recent past .",
    "furthermore , a comprehensive work on the dynamics of langmuir wave packets in three spatial dimensions @xcite as well as some investigations on arrest of langmuir wave collapse @xcite by the quantum effects can be found in the recent works .",
    "notice that when the wave electric field is strong such that it approaches the decay instability threshold , the interaction of qlws and the qiaws is said to be in ` weak turbulence ' , and then qlws are essentially scattered off qiaws . on the other hand , when the electric field intensity is so strong that the mi threshold is exceeded , the interaction results in ` strong turbulence ' regime in which qlws are typically trapped by the density cavities associated with the qiaws .",
    "such phenomena can frequently occur in plasmas .",
    "moreover , the transfer of energy to few stronger modes with small spatial scales can take place due to a chaotic process , and this energy transfer can be faster when the chaotic process in a subsystem of the qzes is well developed @xcite .    in the present work , we will investigate the full qzes numerically especially when the wave number of modulation is small enough from its critical value .",
    "the latter , in turn , excites many unstable harmonic modes which in a longer time collide and fuse into fewer new incoherent patterns due to qiaw emission .",
    "we will show that since the critical wave number of modulation ( below which the mi sets in ) depends on the quantum coupling parameter @xmath2 the length scale of excitation for the transition from temporal chaos ( tc ) to spatiotemporal chaos ( stc ) is to be larger than the classical case .",
    "moreover , lower the values of @xmath3 , the higher is the number of unstable harmonic modes .",
    "furthermore , we will show that the solitary waves thus formed due to mi will lose their strength after a long time through random collision and fusion among the patterns under strong qiaw emission .",
    "this process becomes quicker whenever the density correlation due to quantum fluctuation becomes strong with higher values of the quantum parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the stc state is then said to emerge , and the energy of the system is thus redistributed to new incoherent patterns as well as to few stronger modes with small length scales .",
    "the nonlinear interaction of qlws and qiaws is described by the following one - dimensional qzes @xcite .",
    "@xmath4@xmath5 where @xmath6 is the slowly varying wave envelope of the hf electric field and @xmath7 is the lf plasma density perturbation due to qiaw fluctuation .",
    "also , @xmath8which is associated with the bohm potential , represents the ratio of the ion plasmon energy to the electron thermal energy . here",
    "@xmath9 is the scaled planck s constant , @xmath10 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath11 is the electron temperature and @xmath12 is the ion ( electron ) plasma frequency with @xmath13 denoting the constant background density and @xmath14 the ion ( electron ) mass .",
    "the electric field @xmath15 is normalized by @xmath16 , the density @xmath17 by @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , the space and time variables are rescaled by @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the electron debye length .",
    "note that by disregarding the term @xmath22 in eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) , one recovers the well - known czes @xcite .",
    "the latter have been widely studied in the context of solitons , chaos and langmuir turbulence in many areas of plasma physics ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "it is thus of natural interest to investigate the qzes in the quantum realm , which may be useful for understanding the onset of plasma wave turbulence at nanoscales in both laboratory and astrophysical plasmas .",
    "the growth rate of mi can be obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) by assuming the perturbations of the form exp@xmath23 from a spatially homogeneous pump electric field @xmath24 as @xcite @xmath25   ^{1/2 } , \\label{3}%\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 it can be shown that the growth rate is maximum at @xmath1 and decreases for increasing values of @xmath0 with cut - offs at lower wave numbers of modulation @xcite .    in order to solve numerically the eqs . ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) we choose the following initial condition @xcite @xmath28   , \\text { } n(x,0)=-\\sqrt{2}% e_{0}k\\beta\\cos(kx ) , \\label{4}%\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the amplitude of the pump langmuir wave  field and @xmath29 is a constant of the order of @xmath30 to emphasize that the perturbation is very small .",
    "we use runge - kutta scheme with time step size @xmath31 and consider the grid size @xmath32 so that @xmath33 corresponds  to the grid position @xmath34 .",
    "the spatial derivatives are approximated with centered second - order difference approximations .",

    "moreover , the dynamics is subsonic in the regime @xmath45 where the mi growth rate is small .",
    "as @xmath46 is lowered from @xmath47 many unstable modes with higher harmonic modes will be excited .  again",

    "( [ 5 ] ) comes from the master mode and unstable harmonic modes with @xmath57 being due to pattern selection , whereas the second term is due to the nonlinear interaction among the patterns formed .",

    "2 ) which due to qiaw emission collide and get fused into few incoherent patterns after a long time .",
    "the collision is random and not confined between two patterns .",
    "few stable modes are also excited .",
    "the system energy is then redistributed to new incoherent patterns and few stable modes with small length scales .",
    "the system is in the state of stc.,width=288,height=288 ]    the profiles of the electric field and the density fluctuation at the end of simulation are shown in fig.1 for @xmath39 and @xmath1 .",
    "we observe an excited electric field of the order @xmath59 highly correlated with density depletion @xmath60 or @xmath61 from fig .",
    "2 , we find that many solitary patterns are formed from the master mode and unstable harmonic modes by means of pattern selection .",
    "two solitary patterns initially peaked in @xmath62 collide to form a new mode which again collides with the master pattern peaked at @xmath63 and fuses into a new strong mode .",
    "after few more other collisions and fusions , there remain only four distorted patterns . the system is then said to emerge the stc state . when @xmath46 is further lowered many solitary trains",
    "are excited and saturated .",
    "as soon as the collisions and fusions among the solitary patterns take place and the new incoherent trains are formed under strong qiaw emission , these incoherent patterns then collide with some others repeatedly and finally there remain few incoherent patterns in stochastic motion with the greater part of the system energy .",
    "meanwhile many stronger modes are also excited to share the energy .",
    "these are shown in figs . 3 , 4 and figs . 5 , 6 for different values of @xmath0 : @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively .",
    "we observe that though the number of remaining modes are the same for both the cases , however , many more ( compared to fig .",
    "6 ) solitary patterns are seen to form initially ( fig .",
    "4 ) which later participate into the collisions and fusions under qiaw emission . moreover , the new incoherent patterns formed with the lapse of long time are more stronger as in fig .",
    "6 than those in fig .",
    "4 . furthermore , for higher values of @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "6 ) the collisions and fusions take place at an earlier time than the case of lower @xmath0 ( fig.4 ) .",
    "thus , a certain amount of energy which was initially distributed among many solitary waves , will now be transferred to a few incoherent patterns as well as to some stable higher harmonic modes with short wave lengths .",
    "so , if initially there form many solitary pattern trains due to mi with different modulational lengths , collision and fusion among most them can lead to the stc state . there must exist a critical wavelength or wave number @xmath66 at which the transition from temporal chaos to stc takes place .",
    "this value , in the quantum case ( @xmath67 ) is quite different from the classical one ( @xmath1 ) . for detail investigations readers",

    "the pattern selection leads to many solitary patterns , but less than that in fig .",
    "4 . though , the collision is random and not confined between two patterns , but they fuse into new incoherent patterns in a shorter time than the case of @xmath64 ( fig .",
    "4 ) due to strong qiaw emission .",

    "we have performed a simulation study of the qzes to show that many coherent solitary patterns can be excited and saturated through the mi of unstable harmonic modes by a modulation wave number of qlws .",
    "it is observed that there exist critical values of @xmath46 for which the motion of the coherent solitary patterns is in the state of tc or in stc .",
    "the transition from tc to stc occurs when @xmath68 for @xmath1 or , for @xmath69when @xmath70 it is shown that the dispersion due to quantum tunneling induces strong qiaw emission leading to collision and fusion among the patterns to occur at an earlier time than the classical case .",
