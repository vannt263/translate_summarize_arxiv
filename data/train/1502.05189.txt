    "the microscopic dynamics and interaction of defects , like dislocations , vacancies and interstitials are key to a variety of macroscopic phenomena of materials @xcite . in two dimensional systems",
    "@xcite the peculiar two step melting is a result of dislocation and disclination interactions and melting is mediated by the formation and subsequent dissociation of dislocation pairs @xcite .",
    "dislocations pairs in 2d - crystals also form as the result of spontaneous clustering of interstitals and vacancies introduced into the systems @xcite . the dynamics and",
    "interaction of interstitials and vacancies is even related to exotic phases such as supersolidity @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , even though individual defects and their displacement fields are well described by elasticity theory , the precise kinetics and the sign of the interaction can not be captured by the theory @xcite .",
    "the open question is how the defect kinetics emerges from the non - linear effects near the defect centers .",
    "video microscopy of two dimensional colloidal crystals together with optical tweezers now allow to investigate such nonlinear effects with single particle resolution in real time @xcite .    here",
    ", we show that the dynamics of defects in two - dimensional dipolar crystals can be fully described by a sequence of jumps between states which are defined by the local displacements in the vicinity of the defect centers .",
    "the equilibrium probabilities of the states ( i.e. the populations ) are a result of the interplay between entropic and energetic contributions .",
    "we find that the different contributions can be understood quantitatively from statistical mechanics by a harmonic expansion of the energy around the minima corresponding to the various defect states .",
    "the kinetics of the defects follows a master equation for which we measure the transition matrix from a long experimental trajectory with the aid of an optimization routine .",
    "the results from experiments are compared with the results from monte carlo simulations .",
    "the equilibrium probabilities from simulation and experiment are in qualitative good agreement but show systematic differences for stiff crystals .     and cyclic @xmath0 point groups in 2d .",
    "the upper left index denotes interstitial versus vacancies and the upper right counts the numbers of seven - fold particles ( in case of interstitials ) and five - fold particles ( in case of vacancies ) .",
    "particles with @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 neighbors are shown in blue , orange , green , and purple , respectively , and particles with @xmath6 neighbors are shown in black . note that the symmetry of the most frequent low temperature configurations ( second column ) differ for interstitials and vacancies .",
    "the vacancies show only cyclic symmetry for low temperatures.,width=340 ]",
    "we consider a system of super - paramagnetic colloidal particles ( @xmath7 m in diameter ) confined by gravity to two dimensions on a flat interface .",
    "two situations were realized , a flat water / air interface in hanging droplet geometry and a solid interface of a glass substrate .",
    "the only difference in both realizations is a slightly enhanced self diffusion coefficient of colloidal particles at the water / air interface on the expense of an increased equilibration time after mounting the sample compared to the solid substrate .",
    "the latter is due to a nontrivial regulation of the curvature of the droplet @xcite .",
    "video microscopy and digital image analysis provides the position of the particles at a frame rate of about @xmath8 hz which is fast compared to the brownian timescale of @xmath9 sec .",
    "the colloidal ensemble is described by the hamiltonian @xmath10 with the pair interaction for particles at distance @xmath11 @xmath12 here , @xmath13 with the boltzmann constant @xmath14 and temperature @xmath15 .",
    "the distance is given in units of @xmath16 , the average inter - particle distance of the triangular lattice .",
    "the dimension - less parameter @xmath17 defines the phase behavior of the system and can be interpreted as an inverse temperature , tuned with the magnetic field @xmath18 . here",
    ", @xmath19 is the permeability of vacuum , @xmath20 is the magnetic susceptibility of the particles and @xmath21 is the 2d particle density .",
    "the experimental setup is described in detail in refs . @xcite . on the solid substrate a vacancy",
    "is prepared by trapping a colloid with an optical tweezer ( 20mw , 100x tweezer - objective from above the sample , na 0.73 , @xmath22-laser ) and pulling it alongside a lattice line out of the field of view ( at least more than 15 lattice spacings ) .",
    "correspondingly , an interstitial is created by pulling a particle from the far field into the center of the field of view of an otherwise defect free crystal .",
    "samples confined at the water / air interface offers additionally the possibility to shoot particles out of the interface by light pressure with a strong laser pulse ( 500mw ) . since the sound velocity is of the order of a few mm / s the distorted lattice relaxes rapidly and measurements are started after about a minute .",
    "positional data were taken at three different interactions strength @xmath23 with more than 3,000 configurations in the case of @xmath24 and @xmath25 and more than 20,000 configurations in the case of @xmath26 for both interstitials and vacancies . for @xmath26",
    "the creation of the defect was repeated frequently , annealing the crystal and equilibrating the systems in between for several days up to a few weeks .",
    "in equilibrium , the vacancies and interstitials exist in different , almost degenerate states with different topologies @xcite .",
    "the most frequently appearing vacancy and interstitial states are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : states ] and we classify the defects according to their point groups in two dimension . @xmath0 denotes the cyclic group with n - fold rotational symmetry whereas @xmath1 is the dihedral group with additionally @xmath27 mirror axes .",
    "the upper left index denotes vacancies or interstitials and the upper right index counts the number of dislocations involved in the defect . in 2d",
    "a dislocation is a pair of a five- ( colored orange in fig.[fig : states ] ) and seven - fold ( colored green ) coordinated particles characterized by a burgers - vector .",
    "the neighbor numbers in the vicinity of the defect centers are determined using a voronoi construction @xcite .",
    "the dissociation of dislocations is known to drive the melting transition in 2d @xcite .",
    "the most frequent defect configurations are listed in table [ tbl : definition ] and the index @xmath28 is introduced to label the defects in the formula below and for the computations of transition rates .",
    "configurations with larger numbers of dislocations exist and are numbered with _ others _ ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "note , that the number of such defects vanishes for large @xmath30 ( see dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : probabilities ] ) .",
    "transition rate constants obtained with this optimization procedure for vacancies and interstitials are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : kij ] .",
    "the results from computer simulations and experiments are in very good agreement .",
    "the results show that the transition rates are not homogeneous .",
    "the most dominant transitions are @xmath31 for interstitials and @xmath32 for vacancies .",
    "we also identify several transitions with a vanishing rate ( e.g. @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "we plan to investigate the exact microscopic mechanism for these rare transitions in the future .",
    "+ in summary we have shown that geometrical defects like interstitials and vacancies appear as different topological configurations mainly constructed of two , three , or four dislocations where the burger - vector cancels .",
    "we characterize the configurations by the symmetry of 2d point groups and show that the symmetries for interstitials and vacancies are not equivalent .",
    "the relative equilibrium probabilities of defects vary as a function of the temperature . in the low temperature limit , the probabilities of @xmath35 and @xmath36 symmetries are largest for interstitials , while vacancies are predominantly in the @xmath37 symmetry .",
    "this completely different temperature dependence of vacancies and interstitials is not dominated by their energy , which is almost degenerated but by the entropy .",
    "the entropic and energetic contributions can be accurately determined from a second order expansion of the energy with respect to displacements .",
    "the kinetics of the defects is well described by a master equation in a multi - state markov model .",
    "the states are different symmetries of the defects and the rates between different states are determined from time correlation functions , which we measure in experiment and computer simulations .",
    "this work presents a detailed study on the defect energetics and dynamics of point defects in two dimensional materials .",
    "we hope that this motivates experiments in other two dimensional systems .",
    "a particular future question which becomes accessible , e.g. in ultracold dipolar quantum gases @xcite and graphene @xcite is the role quantum fluctuations in the defect dynamics .",
