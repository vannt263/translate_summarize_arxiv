    "wireless multi - hop networks , also refereed to as wireless sensor networks and wireless ad hoc networks , consist of a group of sensor nodes deployed over a finite region  @xcite .",
    "the nodes operate in a decentralized manner without the need of any fixed infrastructure , i.e. , the nodes communicate with each other via a single - hop wireless path  ( if they are in range ) or via a multi - hop wireless path . in most of the applications ,",
    "such wireless networks are formed by distributing a finite ( small ) number of nodes in a finite area , which is typically assumed to be a square region  @xcite .",
    "connectivity is a basic requirement for the planning and effective operation of wireless multi - hop networks  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-connectivity is a most general notion of connectivity and an important characteristic of wireless multi - hop networks  @xcite .",
    "the network being @xmath1-connected ensures that there exists at least @xmath1 _ independent _ multi - hop paths between any two nodes . in other words",
    ", @xmath1-connected network would still be @xmath2-connected if @xmath3 nodes forming the network fail .",
    "the _ probability of node isolation _ , defined as the probability that a randomly selected node has no connections to any other nodes , plays a key role in determining the overall network connectivity  ( 1-connectivity )  @xcite . the _ minimum node degree distribution _ , which is the probability that each node in the network has at least @xmath1 neighbours , is crucial in determining the @xmath1-connectivity of the network  @xcite .    for large - scale wireless sensor networks ,",
    "assuming poisson distributed nodes in an infinite area , the connectivity properties such as probability of isolation , average node degree , @xmath1-connectivity have been well studied  @xcite .",
    "when the node locations follow an infinite homogeneous poisson point process and assuming all nodes have the same transmission range , it has been shown that the network becomes @xmath1-connected with high probability  ( close to @xmath2 ) at the same time the minimum node degree of the network approaches @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "this fact was used to approximate the probability of @xmath1-connectivity by the minimum node degree distribution in @xcite .",
    "it was also used to determine the asymptotic value of the minimum transmission range for @xmath1-connectivity for a uniform distribution of nodes in a unit square and disk  @xcite .      since",
    "many practical multi - hop networks are formed by distributing a finite number of nodes in a finite area , there has been an increasing interest to model and determine the connectivity properties in finite multi - hop networks  @xcite .",
    "this is also due to the fact , established earlier in @xcite and recently in @xcite , that the asymptotic connectivity results for large - scale networks provide an extremely poor approximation for finite wireless networks .",
    "this poor approximation is due to the boundary effects experienced by the nodes near the borders of the finite region over which the nodes are deployed .",
    "since the nodes located close to the physical boundaries of the network have a limited coverage area , they have a greater probability of isolation .",
    "therefore , the boundary effects play an important role in determining the overall network connectivity .",
    "different approaches have been used in the literature , to try to model the boundary effects including ( i ) using geometrical probability  @xcite and dividing the square region into smaller subregions to facilitate asymptotic analysis of the transmission range for @xmath1-connectivity  @xcite and to find mean node degree in different subregions  @xcite , ( ii ) using a cluster expansion approach and decomposing the boundary effects into corners and edges to yield high density approximations  @xcite and ( iii ) using a deterministic grid deployment of nodes in a finite area  @xcite to approximate the boundary effects with random deployment of nodes  @xcite .",
    "the above approaches provide bounds , rather than exact results , for the probability of node isolation and/or probability of connectivity . for a wireless network deployed over a finite area ,",
    "the existing results for @xmath1-connectivity and minimum node degree are asymptotic  ( infinite @xmath0 )  @xcite .",
    "an attempt was made in @xcite to study the minimum node degree and @xmath1-connectivity by circumventing modeling of the boundary effects but the results were shown to be valid for large density  ( number of nodes ) only . therefore , it is still largely an open research problem to characterize the boundary effects and to find general frameworks for deriving the exact results for the probability of node isolation and the minimum node degree distribution , when a finite number of nodes are independently and uniformly distributed inside a finite region .      in the above context , we address the following open questions in this paper for a wireless network of @xmath0 nodes , which are uniformly distributed over a square region :    1",
    ".   how can we accurately account for the boundary effects to determine the exact probability of node isolation ? 2 .",
    "how can we incorporate the boundary effects to find the minimum node degree distribution ?    in this paper , addressing the above two open questions , we present a tractable analytical framework for the exact calculation of the probability of node isolation and the minimum node degree distribution in finite wireless multi - hop networks , when @xmath0 nodes are independently and uniformly distributed in a square region . our proposed framework partitions the square into unequal subregions , based on the transmission range and the location of an arbitrary node .",
    "using geometrical probability , we show that for each subregion , the probability that a random node falls inside a disk centered at an arbitrary node located in that subregion can be expressed analytically in closed - form .",
    "this framework accurately models the boundary effects and leads to an exact expression for the probability of node isolation and the minimum node degree distribution , which can be easily evaluated numerically .",
    "we show that the minimum node degree distribution can be used as an upper bound for the probability of @xmath1-connectivity .",
    "since the @xmath1-connectivity depends on the number of nodes deployed over the finite region and the transmission range of each node  @xcite , the transmission range must be large enough to ensure that the network is connected but small enough to minimize the power consumption at each node and interference between nodes  @xcite , which in turn maximizes the network capacity .",
    "this fundamental trade - off between the network connectivity and the network capacity leads to the following network design question :    1 .   given a network of @xmath0 nodes distributed over a square region , what is the minimum transmission range such that a network is connected with a high probability or alternatively , what is the minimum number of nodes for a given transmission range such that the network is connected ?",
    "addressing this network design problem , we show through an example how the proposed framework can be used to determine the minimum transmission range required for the network to be connected with high probability .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model , problem formulation and connectivity properties of a wireless network are presented in section[sec : system_model ] . the proposed framework to evaluate the probability of node isolation and the minimum node degree distribution",
    "is provided in section[sec : framework ] .",
    "the boundary effects in the different regions formed with the change in transmission range are presented in section  iv .",
    "the validation of the proposed framework via simulation results and the design example are presented in section[sec : results ] .",
    "finally , section[sec : conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "consider @xmath0 nodes which are uniformly and independently distributed inside a square region @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the two dimensional euclidean domain .",
    "let @xmath6 and @xmath7 , for @xmath8 , denote the side and vertex of the square , respectively , which are numbered in an anticlockwise direction . without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume that the first vertex @xmath9 of the square is located at the origin @xmath10 and we consider a unit square region defined as @xmath11    let @xmath12 denote the position of an arbitrary node inside the square @xmath13 . the node distribution probability density function ( pdf )",
    "can be expressed as @xmath14    we define @xmath15 as a measure of the physical area of the square region , where @xmath16 and the integration is performed over the two dimensional square region @xmath13 . note that @xmath17 since we assume a unit square .",
    "we assume that each sensor node has a fixed transmission range @xmath18 and the _ coverage region _ of a node located at @xmath19 is then a disk @xmath20 of radius @xmath18 centered at the node .",
    "note that the _ coverage area _ @xmath21 .",
    "the number of nodes inside the coverage area of a certain node are termed as its neighbors .      in this subsection",
    ", we define the key connectivity properties of a multi - hop network , which are considered in this paper .",
    "let the cumulative distribution function  ( cdf ) @xmath22 denote the conditional probability of connectivity that a randomly placed node according to uniform probability density function ( pdf ) is connected to a node located at @xmath19 .",
    "mathematically , @xmath23    let @xmath24 denote the probability of node isolation that any node in the network is isolated . assuming that the probability of node isolation is independent for each node , the probability that a given node at @xmath19 is isolated is given by @xmath25 , which can be averaged over all possible locations to evaluate @xmath24 as @xmath26    for a uniform distribution of @xmath0 nodes in a square region , define the minimum node degree as the minimum of number of neighbors of _ any _ node in the region .",
    "let the discrete random variable @xmath27 denote the minimum node degree .",
    "the associated pdf , termed as the minimum node degree distribution is given by @xmath28 the details of the formulation of @xmath29 are provided in appendix  a.    a network of @xmath0 nodes is said to be @xmath2-connected  ( or connected ) if there exists at least one path between any pair of randomly chosen nodes .",
    "a network of @xmath0 nodes is said to be @xmath1-connected  ( @xmath30 ) if there exist at least @xmath1 mutually independent paths between any pair of randomly chosen nodes .",
    "in other words , a network is @xmath1-connected if the network stays @xmath2-connected with the removal of any @xmath3 nodes .",
    "let @xmath31 denote the probability that the network of @xmath0 nodes  ( each with transmission range @xmath18 ) is @xmath1-connected .",
    "next we examine the relation between probability @xmath31 and the minimum node degree distribution @xmath29 .",
    "penrose  @xcite presented in his work on graph theory that a random network for large enough number of nodes , becomes @xmath1-connected at the same instant it acheives the minimum node degree @xmath1 with high probability , that is , @xmath29 serves as an upper bound on @xmath31 , which gets tighter as both @xmath29 and @xmath31 approach one or the number of nodes approaches infinity .",
    "mathematically , we can express this as @xmath32 we note that the minimum node degree distribution is of fundamental importance  @xcite as ( i ) it determines the connectivity of the network  ( @xmath33 ) , ( ii ) takes into account the failure of the nodes and ( iii ) also determines the minimum node degree of the network  ( @xmath31 ) . using and , we also note the relationship between @xmath24 and @xmath29 : @xmath34 .",
    "since @xmath35 denotes the probability that each node has at least one neighbor , it has been also referred to as the probability of no isolated node in the literature  @xcite .",
    "there are two key challenges in evaluating the probability of node isolation @xmath24 in and the minimum node degree distribution @xmath29 in .",
    "the _ first challenge _ is to find the cdf in , which requires the evaluation of the overlap area @xmath36 . in  @xcite",
    ", it is proposed to find this intersection area using polar coordinates and dividing the square into different radial regions .",
    "however , due to the dependance between the polar radius and the polar angle , this approach does not lead to closed - form solutions . in  @xcite ,",
    "an alternative approach is presented for finding the intersection area by first finding the area of circular segments formed outside the sides and vertices and then subtracting from the area of the disk .",
    "this approach leads to closed - form solutions and is adopted in this work .",
    "the _ second challenge _ is to average the cdf given in over the square in order to determine the probability of node isolation @xmath24 in and the minimum node degree distribution @xmath29 in .",
    "@xmath22 is a function of both the node location @xmath19 and the transmission range @xmath18 . for a unit square ,",
    "if @xmath37 , then the disk @xmath20 will cover the whole square @xmath13 and hence @xmath38 , irrespective of the node location .",
    "for intermediate values of the node range @xmath39 , both @xmath19 and @xmath18 need to be taken into account in determining @xmath22 .",
    "this adds further complexity to the task of evaluating and .",
    "a tractable exact solution to this problem is presented in the next section .",
    "we use the approach suggested in @xcite in order to quantify the overlap area @xmath36 . the basic building blocks in this approach to characterize the boundary effects are ( i ) the circular segment areas formed outside each side ( _ border effects _ ) and ( ii ) the corner overlap areas between two circular segments formed at each vertex ( _ corner effects _ ) . we modify the approach in  @xcite by placing the origin at the vertex @xmath9 , rather than at the center of the square .",
    "this leads to a simpler formulation , as discussed below .",
    "let @xmath40 denote the area of the circular segment formed outside the side @xmath41 , as illustrated in fig.[fig : one ] .",
    "using the fact that the area of the circular segment is equal to the area of the circular sector minus the area of the triangular portion , we obtain @xmath42    where @xmath43 denotes the euclidean distance between @xmath19 and side @xmath44 .",
    "similarly , the areas of the circular segments formed outside the sides @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , can be expressed as @xmath48 @xmath49 let @xmath50 denote the area of the corner overlap region between two circular segments at vertex @xmath51 , as illustrated in fig.[fig : one ] . using the fact that the area of the overlap region is equal to the area of the circular sector minus the area of two triangular portions , we can easily show that @xmath52 @xmath53    where the angle @xmath54 is given by @xmath55    where @xmath56 denotes the absolute value or modulus and @xmath57 . similarly , the areas of the corner overlap region formed at vertex @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively , can be expressed as @xmath61 @xmath62    where the angles @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are given by @xmath66    where @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we note that the expressions for @xmath70 are valid only when @xmath71 , where @xmath72 denotes the euclidean distance between @xmath19 and vertex @xmath73 .. for the case when @xmath74 , @xmath75 .    using @xmath76 and @xmath77@xmath76",
    ", the cdf @xmath22 in can be expressed in closed - form , e.g. , if @xmath78 and @xmath79 , then two circular segments are formed outside sides @xmath80 and @xmath81 and also there is overlap between them .",
    "hence , in this case , @xmath82",
    ". this will be further illustrated in the next subsection .",
    "as illustrated in the last subsection , for a given value of the transmission range @xmath18 and the location of the arbitrary node @xmath19 , @xmath22 can be expressed in closed - form using @xmath76 and @xmath77@xmath76 . in order to facilitate the averaging of over the whole square region",
    ", we divide the square region into different non - overlapping subregions based on the different border and corner effects that occur in that region . due to the symmetry of the square",
    ", some subregions have the same number of border and corner effects which can be exploited to further simplify the averaging .",
    "this will be elaborated in detail shortly .",
    "let @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 @xmath86 denote the type of non - overlapping subregions and @xmath87 , @xmath88 denote the number of subregion of type @xmath89 . if @xmath90 denotes the conditional probability of connectivity for a node located at @xmath91 ,",
    "we can write the probability of node isolation in as @xmath92 and the minimum node degree distribution @xmath29 in as @xmath93    we note that the average node degree denoted by @xmath94 can also be determined using our framework as  @xcite @xmath95 in fact @xmath96 in denotes the cumulative distribution function of the distance between two randomly placed nodes and the closed form analytical results exist in the literature for square , hexagon  @xcite and convex regular polygons  @xcite .",
    "the general formulation for @xmath24 in is also indirectly suggested in  @xcite .",
    "however , no guidelines are presented in order to evaluate .",
    "hence , the authors in  @xcite use a deterministic grid deployment of nodes to approximate the boundary effects when nodes are uniformly and independently distributed in a square region .",
    "by contrast , we provide a tractable framework for complete and exact characterization of the boundary effects in .",
    "while @xmath90 in   can be expressed analytically in closed - form , the integration in and does not have a closed - form due to the @xmath97 factor in the exponent .",
    "however , it can be easily evaluated numerically using the explicit closed - form expressions for @xmath90 for different transmission ranges and different subregions .",
    "it must be noted that numerical evaluation of two - fold integrals is widely practiced in the literature  @xcite .",
    "we have considered a unit square region for the sake of simplicity in the proposed formulation . for the general case of a square of side length @xmath98 ,",
    "- can be used with appropriate scaling of the transmission range as @xmath99 .    since the subregions are classified on the basis of the boundary effects , the subregions change with the transmission range @xmath18 .",
    "we divide the range @xmath18 over the desired interval @xmath100 , as explained in section ii - c , such that the boundary effects are the same for the different subregions over each subinterval of the transmission range .",
    "this is explained in detail in the next section .",
    "consider the first case of the transmission range , i.e. , @xmath102 , as shown in fig.[fig : ranges_one ] .",
    "this case may be of greatest interest in many practical situations where typically the sensor transmission range is a small fraction of the side length of the square . in this case",
    ", we can divide the square into four  ( @xmath103 ) types of subregions @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 . as shown in fig.[fig : ranges_one ] , although there is one subregion of type @xmath83 , there are four subregions of types @xmath84 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively , which are shaded in the same color for ease of identification , e.g. , for an arbitrary node located in any subregion of type @xmath84 , the disk @xmath20 is limited by one side only . hence , we determine @xmath90 only for the following subregions    @xmath106    @xmath107    @xmath108    @xmath109    * subregions   [ table1 ]    l|m0.2cm|m4 cm @xmath89 & @xmath87 & @xmath90 + @xmath83 & @xmath2 & @xmath110 + @xmath84 & @xmath111 & @xmath112 + @xmath104 & @xmath111 & @xmath113 + @xmath105 & @xmath111 & @xmath114 +    [ fig : ranges_one ]    it is easy to see that for an arbitrary node located anywhere in subregion @xmath83 , the disk @xmath20 is completely inside the square @xmath13 , i.e. , there are no border or corner effects .",
