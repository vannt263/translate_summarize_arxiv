    "since the recent discovery of superconductivity at elevated temperature in f - substituted lafeaso , @xcite a large amount of experimental and theoretical effort was concentrated on studies of magnetic , superconducting and normal state properties of fe - based superconductors and related materials .",
    "@xcite of several families of fe - based superconductors discovered by now , the 122 , aefe@xmath2as@xmath2 ( ae = alkaline earth and eu ) family , appears to be the most studied one @xcite due to the reasonable ease of growing large , high quality , single crystals , the availability of multiple substitution sites and the simplicity of the crystal structure . in the 122 system ,",
    "superconductivity , with a @xmath6 k , was first reported on k - doping of bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite subsequently the complete ( ba@xmath7k@xmath8)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 solid solution series was studied @xcite in detail .",
    "kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 stands out among the members of the ( ba@xmath7k@xmath8)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 series , and the fe - based superconductors in general , as a unique material .",
    "it is a stoichiometric end - member of the ( ba@xmath7k@xmath8)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 series , and a rare example of a stoichiometric fe - based superconductor , albeit with a rather low @xmath9 k. @xcite the in - plane resistivity has a metallic behavior with a remarkable residual resistivity ratio , exceeding 1000 in the best single crystals .",
    "@xcite the reported fermi surface of kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 differs from that of the optimally doped ( ba@xmath7k@xmath8)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 having three hole pockets , two centered at the @xmath10 point in the brillouin zone , and one around the @xmath11 point @xcite with no electron pockets .",
    "existence of quantum criticality , and nodal or @xmath12-wave superconductivity was suggested and discussed in number of publications .",
    "@xcite    given the unusual properties of this material , it is of importance to have a broad set of data on its physical properties , in particular , related to its superconducting state . in this work",
    "we study the response of kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 s superconducting transition temperature to external pressure , both hydrostatic , via direct measurements , and uniaxial , that is inferred by using the ehrenfest relation for the second order phase transition .",
    "hydrostatic pressure effects historically have been studied for many superconductors , including some fe - based materials .",
    "@xcite uniaxial pressure effects are rarely measured directly , @xcite due to significant technical difficulties , however evaluations of the uniaxial pressure derivatives , @xmath13 , ( @xmath14 ) by combining the thermal expansion and heat capacity data , have been recently made for several bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 - based materials @xcite yielding in - plane and @xmath0-axis uniaxial pressure derivatives of the opposite signs and distinct evolution of these derivatives with doping .",
    "kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 single crystals were grown by using kas flux method .",
    "@xcite briefly , k ( ingot ) , as ( lump ) , and fe ( powder ) were weighed at an atomic ratio of k : fe : as = 5 : 2 : 6 , and loaded into an alumina crucible .",
    "a sealing technique with liquid tin melt was developed to suppress the evaporation of k and as elements .",
    "@xcite all the steps were performed in a glove box under argon gas atmosphere .",
    "the sealed fused silica ampule was heated up to 920@xmath15 c , and then slowly cooled down to 620@xmath15 c at a rate of 1@xmath15 c / h .",
    "thin , plate - like crystals , with dimensions up to @xmath16 mm@xmath17 , can be easily mechanically separated from the kas flux .. the further details of the crystal growth will be reported elsewhere .",
    "@xcite the crystals are plate - like with the @xmath0-axis perpendicular to the plate .",
    "they are soft , micaceous and moderately air - sensitive .",
    "low - field dc magnetization under pressure , was measured in a quantum design magnetic property measurement system , mpms-5 , squid magnetometer using a a commercial , hmd , be - cu piston - cylinder pressure cell . @xcite daphne oil 7373 was used as a pressure medium and superconducting pb as a low - temperature pressure gauge .",
    "thermal expansion data were obtained using a capacitive dilatometer constructed of ofhc copper ; a detailed description of the dilatometer is presented elsewhere .",
    "@xcite the dilatometer was mounted in a quantum design physical property measurement system , ppms-14 , instrument and was operated over a temperature range of 1.8 - 305 k. due to the morphology of the crystals , the dilation was measured only along the @xmath0-axis .",
    "the heat capacity was measured using a hybrid adiabatic relaxation technique of the heat capacity option in a quantum design , ppms-9 instrument .",
    "the low temperature heat capacity of kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 is plotted as @xmath18 vs ( t ) in fig .",
    "the jump in specific heat associated with the superconducting transition is rather sharp . from the isoentropic",
    "construct , shown in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , @xmath19 k , @xmath20 mj / mol k@xmath21 . from the linear fit of the @xmath18 vs @xmath22 above the superconducting transition ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , inset ) , the sommerfeld coefficient , @xmath23 mj / mol k@xmath21 , and the debye temperature , @xmath24 k can be estimated .",
    "these results are comparable to the literature data .",
    "@xcite    low field ( @xmath25 oe ) zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) temperature - dependent magnetization data taken under pressures up to @xmath26 kbar are shown in fig .",
    "the signal associated with the superconducting transition in kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 is sharp , under pressure the transition shifts to lower temperatures without any significant broadening .",
    "the pressure dependence of @xmath3 ( defined as an onset of transition in magnetization , see fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) is shown in the inset to fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . a linear fit of @xmath27 results in the value of the pressure derivative , @xmath28 k / kbar , so that in a simple , linear , approximation superconductivity in kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 can be suppressed by a pressure of @xmath29 kbar .",
    "it appears that the measured @xmath27 dependence has a slight upward curvature .",
    "indeed , one can also fit @xmath30 with a second order polynomial ( shown as a dashed line in the inset to fig .",
    ". then the linear coefficient corresponding to the initial @xmath31 is @xmath32 k / kbar ( the quadratic coefficient equals to @xmath33 k / kbar@xmath21 ) .",
    "very similar results are obtained if a different criterion ( e.g. maximum of @xmath34 ) is used .",
    "temperature dependent @xmath0 - axis dilation , normalized to the value at 1.8 k ( @xmath35 ) , is shown in fig .",
    "the overall behavior is monotonic with some flattening at low temperatures .",
    "the relative change in the @xmath0 - axis from 1.8 to 300 k is similar to that measured in pure aefe@xmath2as@xmath2 ( ae = ba , sr , ca ) @xcite and co - doped bafe@xmath2as@xmath36 @xcite , with the value of the thermal expansion coefficient , @xmath37 , at room temperature being under @xmath38 k@xmath39 . both , the @xmath0-axis dilation and the thermal expansion coefficient show a clear anomaly at the superconducting transition .",
    "the jump in the thermal expansion coefficient at @xmath3 ( using the criterion graphically similar to that for @xmath40 in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) can be estimated as @xmath41 k@xmath39 .",
    "the shape and sharpness of the features in the thermal expansion coefficient and the heat capacity at @xmath3 are very similar ( fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , inset ) , that rationalizes use of the same criterion for both measurements .",
    "the value of the hydrostatic pressure derivative , @xmath42 k / kbar , measured for kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 is rather large .",
    "it is close to , but somewhat smaller than @xmath43 k / kbar reported for stoichiometric , polycrystalline , rbfe@xmath2as@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite it has to be noted that for slightly overdoped ( ba@xmath44k@xmath45)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 rather large , negative , pressure derivatives , @xmath46 k / kbar and @xmath47 k / kbar were reported as well .",
    "@xcite the evolution of the @xmath31 values with k - doping in the ( ba@xmath7k@xmath8)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 series , in particular in the overdoped region , will be useful for further understanding of superconductivity in these materials .",
    "the uniaxial , @xmath0 - axis , pressure derivative of @xmath3 can be inferred using the ehrenfest relation @xcite for the second order phase transition : @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the molar volume ( @xmath50 m@xmath17 for kafe@xmath2as@xmath2 , using the lattice parameters @xcite at 1.7 k ) , @xmath51 is the jump in the thermal expansion coefficient at the phase transition , and @xmath52 is the corresponding jump in the heat capacity .",
    "using the experimental data above , for kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 we found out that the @xmath0 - axis uniaxial pressure derivative is positive , @xmath5 k / kbar .",
    "since the hydrostatic pressure derivative in this case can be written as @xmath53 , we can infer that the uniaxial , @xmath54-axis ( or in - plane ) pressure derivative is negative , @xmath55 k / kbar .",
    "so it appears that kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 is equally sensitive to uniaxial pressure applied in the @xmath56 - plane and along the @xmath0 - axis , however @xmath3 increases when the pressure is applied along the @xmath0-axis and decreases when it is applied in the @xmath56 - plane .",
    "uniaxial pressure derivatives of @xmath3 in members of the 122 family were also reported to have different signs for @xmath56-plane and @xmath0-axis pressure .",
    "we are not aware of such data in the ( ba@xmath7k@xmath8)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 series , but for co - doped ( electron doping ) and p - doped ( isoelectronic substitution ) bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 samples in the overdoped region of the superconducting dome negative values of @xmath57 and positive values of @xmath58 were reported .",
    "@xcite if we consider kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 as an extreme of the overdoped ( ba@xmath7k@xmath8)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 , it is clearly different , in this respect , from the other ( studied so far ) overdoped fe - based superconductors from the 122 family .",
    "it has to be mentioned that the anisotropy and different signs of the uniaxial pressure derivatives of @xmath3 , as inferred from thermal expansion and heat capacity data using the ehrenfest relation , can shed some light on the differences observed in the values of the critical pressure and position of the superconducting dome that vary in publications describing the pressure - temperature phase diagrams in the aefe@xmath2as@xmath2 materials .",
    "@xcite in many cases of the different anvils - based pressure cells an additional , axial , component of pressure is present . with the plate - like aefe@xmath2as@xmath2 samples in a `` convenient geometry '' ,",
    "this means that the @xmath0-axis pressure in such cells is slightly higher than the pressure in the @xmath56 - plane .",
    "then , for the samples with @xmath59 the measured @xmath31 is smaller than the truly hydrostatic value , and vise versa , if @xmath60 , larger than hydrostatic value of @xmath31 is observed in an experiment .",
    "another clear difference between this material and other fe - based , 122 superconductors is that the jump in heat capacity at @xmath3 clearly deviates from the trend suggested in ref . and expanded in ref .",
    ", the so - called bnc scaling ( fig . [ f4 ] ) . at the same time , our data yield @xmath61 that is significantly smaller than the 1.43 value expected for bcs superconductors . these observations are consistent with previous publications @xcite and suggest that superconductivity in kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 neither is a conventional bcs , nor should it be considered as just significantly overdoped fe - based superconductor from the 122 family .",
    "+ to summarize , the superconducting transition temperature of kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 decreases under hydrostatic pressure rather fast , with @xmath62 k / kbar .",
    "the uniaxial , @xmath0 - axis , pressure derivative inferred from the thermal expansion and heat capacity measurements , is positive , that differs from the existing data for overdoped fe - based 122 superconductors .",
    "the jump in heat capacity at @xmath3 for kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 deviates significantly from the empirical trend , @xmath63 ( and its recent modifications ) , observed in a number of fe - based superconductors .",
    "taken together , these results suggest that the superconductivity in kfe@xmath2as@xmath2 could be different from just an extreme overdoped case in the 122 family . detailed , comprehensive studies of the ( ba@xmath7k@xmath8)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 series with @xmath64 approaching 1 , once homogeneous single crystalline samples for these intermediate concentrations are available , might shed a light on physics of this interesting material .",
