    "although one - dimensional systems can be often used to model social dynamics @xcite , it is usually observed that the structure of the majority of online social systems such portals or fora follows a different type of topology  a scale - free one that is reflected in their degree distribution @xcite .",
    "such non - trivial topologies have motivated several researchers to explore the behavior of the one of the most fundamental approach of the statistical physics  ising model @xcite , which has been tested on cayley trees @xcite , ba networks @xcite or growing trees @xcite , to mention a few .    however , there is no direct evidence that social processes that take place in hierarchical trees and scale - free networks can be described by this kind of dynamics . on the other hand the results of our previous analyses",
    "@xcite indicate that one of the most dominant phenomena seen in online portals is a strong dependence of the expressed emotion on the emotion of the last comment ( i.e. , the newest one ) . in order to describe this process in setting of chronologically added comments ( that form a chain )",
    "we have previously explicitly modified ising model hamiltonian by taking into account only node s left neighbor as well as equip our model with a growing component ( a new node is quenched after a single update ) @xcite . here , we extend this concept to tree topologies ( deterministic and stochastic ) in order to explore the influence exerted by intrinsic features of those systems onto the behavior of the model .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we describe in short of the basic concepts of the model introduced in @xcite . sections [ sec : tree ] and [ sec : sf ] gather the results obtained applying dynamics to deterministic and stochastic scale - free trees , respectively .",

    "[ sec : con ] concludes the paper discussing differences between the considered topologies and growing chain .",
    "the basic version of the model uses the idea of a growing chain : the first node of the chain has a random spin @xmath3 ( it can be interpreted as an emotional valence @xcite of a post in online discussion ) , drawn with probability @xmath4 .",
    "after that , another node of the chain is added to the right side of the last one and it is initially equipped with a spin once again drawn with equal probabilities @xmath5 . in the following step , the node becomes a subject to the updating procedure that is based on the ising - like model approach . for each appearing node @xmath6",
    "we define a function @xmath7 , where the constant @xmath8 corresponds to exchange integral in the ising model and @xmath9 is the external field .",
    "the function @xmath10 can be treated as a type of an _ emotional discomfort _",
    "function felt by a user posting a message @xmath11 .",
    "after the spin is drawn , we check how flipping its sign to the opposite one ( i.e. , from @xmath12 to @xmath13 or likewise ) affects the change of function @xmath14 as @xmath15 , where term @xmath16 corresponds to @xmath17 calculated when @xmath18 .",
    "then we follow the metropolis algorithm @xcite i.e. , if the @xmath19 we accept the change , otherwise we test if the expression @xmath20 $ ] is smaller or larger than a random value @xmath21 $ ] ( here @xmath22 is boltzmann constant and @xmath23 is temperature ) .",
    "if the latter occurs we accept the change , otherwise the spin is kept as originally chosen .",
    "the procedure of adding new nodes and setting their spins is repeated until the size @xmath2 of the chain is reached .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that system dynamics follows a two - state markov chain approach defined by the transition matrix @xmath24 @xmath25\\ ] ] with conditional probabilities ( which come from the above described dynamics ) given by @xmath26 where upper signs correspond to case @xmath27 , lower signs to @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    as a result",

    "the motivation is to compare the results obtained for a chain topology with the ones that are derived for deterministic trees and random scale - free trees .",
    "the topology of a deterministic tree is described by two parameters : the number of children @xmath34 each node gives birth to and the depth of the tree @xmath35 .",
    "the total number of vertices ( expect the root one ) is equal to @xmath36 figure [ fig : etree ] illustrates an example of a tree with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .     and @xmath38 .",

    "the first and key observation one needs to make is that in the case of described model ( sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] ) a directed tree can be regarded as equivalent to a chain of length @xmath35 . however , on each level @xmath46 of the tree there is a different number of nodes that have to be taken into account . as a result one obtains a chain whose spin values should be _ weighted _ by the number of nodes present at a given level ( depth ) @xmath46 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : wchain ] ) .",

    "the scheme for obtaining the average spin value in random scale - free trees is similar to the one presented in the previous section .",

    "in this paper we extended previously introduced model of the growing spin chain onto the case of deterministic and random scale - free trees .",
    "we have shown that for these topologies the analytical approach using markov chain concept is still valid owing to the possibility of calculating the weighted spin on each level of the tree . similarly to the chain case , the model exhibits a crossover temperature corresponding to maximal magnetization .",
    "unlike the chain case , the crossover temperature decays very slowly [ approximately as @xmath1 compared to @xmath70 for the chain ] , which is connected to the fact of the effective diameter of the considered systems .",
