    "nowadays breakthrough of wireless communications has provided new and nice problems to the field of coding theory .",
    "indeed strategic issues of mimo communications has lead to consider coding in grassmann and stiefel manifolds , and also in unitary groups @xcite",
    ". codes in unitary groups are useful in the context of non - coherent flat rayleigh channel as shown in @xcite .",
    "the performance of a unitary space - time code @xmath1 is measured ( see @xcite ) by two functions namely the diversity sum @xmath2 and the diversity product @xmath3 : @xmath4 @xmath5 here @xmath6 denotes the standard euclidean norm of complex matrices : @xmath7 .",
    "a standard problem is , given a number @xmath8 of points in @xmath0 , to maximize the value of @xmath2 or of @xmath3 .",
    "many authors have addressed this question , narrowing gaps between bounds and explicit constructions ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the linear programming method , which was initially developed by philippe delsarte in the framework of association schemes @xcite , and is a powerful method to deal with such questions , has not been applied to unitary codes before .",
    "delsarte method was successfully adapted to the compact two - point homogeneous spaces by kabatiansky and levenshtein @xcite and recently to more general situations like the grassmann codes @xcite , the permutation codes @xcite , the ordered codes @xcite , @xcite .",
    "most of the situations mentioned above fit into a common framework , namely a compact group @xmath9 acts homogeneously on the underlying space @xmath10 , and the representation theory of @xmath9 constructs a certain family of orthogonal polynomials naturally attached to @xmath10 .",
    "standard methods of harmonic analysis show that these polynomials hold the desired positivity property that allows for delsarte linear programming method .",
    "this general framework is recalled in section ii , and we show in section iii that unitary codes can be treated likewise , the schur polynomials being the associated family of orthogonal polynomials . section iv and v present the results , both numerical and analytic , obtained by the implementation of this method .",
    "it turns out that we improve all previously known bounds concerning the diversity sum and the diversity product .",
    "moreover it is worth pointing out that the mathod can easily be extended to more complex situations , for example a diversity function involving both @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we briefly describe the linear programming method on homogeneous spaces . for more details",
    "we refer to @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 9 ) for a treatment of 2-point homogeneous spaces , and to @xcite for the prominent case of grassmann codes .",
    "let @xmath9 be a compact group acting transitively and continuously on a compact space @xmath10 , and @xmath11 such that @xmath12 characterizes the orbits of @xmath9 acting on @xmath13 .",
    "we mean here that , for all @xmath14 , @xmath15    let @xmath16 be any subset of @xmath17 , we call a finite subset @xmath18 a @xmath16-code if for all @xmath19 .",
    "a continuous function @xmath20 is said to possess the positivity property if for any finite subset @xmath21 and any complex function @xmath22 ,    @xmath23 a canonical example is the constant function @xmath24 ; non - trivial examples are given by the so called zonal functions that we introduce now .",
    "let @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the unique @xmath9-invariant haar measure on @xmath10 such that @xmath27 .",
    "this vector space is given the standard @xmath9-action defined by @xmath28 and is endowed with the canonical @xmath9-invariant hermitian product : @xmath29 the peter - weil theorem shows that @xmath30 can be decomposed as a direct sum of @xmath9-irreducible subspaces @xmath31 .",
    "the next step is to associate to each irreducible subspace @xmath31 a so - called zonal function @xmath32 .",
    "a standard construction is the following : given an orthonormal basis @xmath33 of @xmath31 , one can define @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "since these functions are constant on @xmath9-orbits we can rewrite @xmath36 . from this property",
    "comes the term _ zonal functions _ used to qualify them . from equation ( [ defeq ] ) it is easy to prove that these zonal functions verify the positivity property and do not depend of the chosen orthonormal basis .",
    "it turns out that , when the irreducible subspaces @xmath31 are pairwise non isomorphic , the cone of continuous positive @xmath9-invariant functions is exactly the set of linear combinations with non negative coefficients of the @xmath32 ( see @xcite ) . in the remaining of this paper",
    "we assume that this condition is satisfied .",
    "we moreover let @xmath37 denote the one - dimensional subspace associated to the trivial representation of @xmath9 .",
    "the so - called linear programming bounds are obtained with the following theorem :    [ fundathm ] let @xmath38 a linear combination of the zonal functions @xmath32 with a finite number of non zero coefficients .",
    "assume furthermore that : @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( the real part of @xmath42 ) is non - positive on @xmath16 .",
    "then any @xmath16-code verifies @xmath43 where @xmath44 for any @xmath45 .",
    "on one hand , @xmath46 on the other hand , @xmath47",
    "as a particular case we set @xmath48 and @xmath49 . for @xmath50 and @xmath51 we set @xmath52 . in this context",
    "the orbit of a pair @xmath53 is characterized by the eigenvalues @xmath54 of the unitary matrix @xmath55 .",
    "the peter - weil theorem gives a decomposition of @xmath30 into irreducible subspaces @xmath56 where the sum runs over all irreducible representations @xmath57 of @xmath0 .",
    "it is worth noticing that the @xmath9-subspaces @xmath58 are pairwise non isomorphic . from this decomposition",
    "one can deduce the following theorem :    the zonal functions associated to this decomposition are @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes any @xmath0 .",
    "the irreducible characters of @xmath0 are known to be finite dimensional and to have a nice description using schur polynomials ( @xcite ) .",
    "we recall briefly some notations and definitions concerning those polynomials .    for any integer @xmath61 ,",
    "a partition of @xmath61 in @xmath62 parts is a finite decreasing sequence of @xmath62 non negative integers which sum exactly to @xmath61 ( @xmath61 is also called the degree of the partition ) .",
    "a partition @xmath63 is dominating @xmath64 ( noted @xmath65 ) if @xmath66 .",
    "given a partition @xmath67 $ ] we define the elementary symmetric polynomials @xmath68 $ ] as the renormalization to a monic polynomial of @xmath69 these polynomials form a basis of the set of symmetric polynomials @xmath70^{\\textrm { sym}}$ ] .",
    "schur polynomials have been intensively studied and have several definitions . for our purpose",
    "we will define the schur polynomials @xmath71 as @xmath72 where the @xmath73 are the so called kostka numbers . for more precision on those numbers see @xcite .",
    "it is clear that schur polynomials form another basis of @xmath70^{\\textrm { sym}}$ ] .",
    "it is well known that the irreducible polynomial characters of @xmath0 are expressed using schur polynomials ( we refer to @xcite for details ) in the following way : let @xmath54 denote the eigenvalues of a unitary matrix @xmath74 , and @xmath63 a partition .",
    "then @xmath75 one obtains all irreducible characters of @xmath0 by multiplying the characters @xmath76 by a relative power of @xmath77 .",
    "all together , we obtain the theorem :    for all partition @xmath63 and @xmath78 , let @xmath79 these rational fractions give the zonal functions associated to the irreducible decomposition in the following way : if @xmath80 , if the eigenvalues of @xmath55 are @xmath54 , then @xmath81    .",
