    "observations of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation have given us unprecedented knowledge of the very early universe and dramatically confirmed the picture of large - scale structure as arising from the gravitational amplification of small perturbations in a universe with a significant cold dark matter component @xcite .",
    "in this model the ionization history of the universe has two main events , a ` recombination ' at @xmath0 in which it went from ionized to neutral and a ` reionization ' during @xmath1 in which the radiation from early generations of collapsed objects was able to ionize the intergalactic medium .",
    "the former event is strongly constrained by the cmb . a new generation of instruments will soon allow us to probe this second event : `` the end of the dark ages '' ( for reviews of reionization see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    since at reionization a very small fraction of the mass affected each and every baryon in the universe",
    ", reionization is particularly sensitive to the distribution and behavior of collapsed structure .",
    "we expect that the ionizing sources are situated in large ( @xmath2k or @xmath3 ) dark matter halos where the gas can cool efficiently to form stars .",
    "models for the sources of reionization thus often start with estimates of the number and properties of virialized dark matter halos at high redshift , the focus of this paper . at @xmath4 ,",
    "halos with @xmath5 are expected to be biased similarly to very massive clusters ( @xmath6 ) today , with the most massive and recently formed halos growing rapidly and merging frequently .",
    "we explore some properties of these collapsed halos at a high redshift using a suite of high resolution , collisionless , n - body simulations .",
    "we pay particular attention to merger rates and mass accretion histories with an eye to applications for reionization .",
    "we also compare the n - body results with the predictions of the oft - used @xcite formalism .    if halo mergers are accompanied by a temporary increase in photon production ( due either to starbursts or increased black hole accretion e.g.  @xcite )",
    "we expect reionization to be influenced by the merger and accretion history of dark matter halos , beyond just the fact that more massive halos emit more photons . with a simple model of star formation",
    "we show that merger - induced scatter in photon production may be significant , with the production rates acquiring a substantial tail to large photon production rates .",
    "since the massive halos are relatively rare , this individual halo scatter is expected to translate into a scatter of photon production rates inside ionized regions , changing the bubble distribution .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : sim ] we describe the n - body simulations .",
    "the basic halo properties are described in  [ sec : halo ] along with the results for mergers and mass gains and the comparison to press - schechter .",
    "the consequences of this merging in a simple model for photon production are elucidated in ",
    "[ sec : reion ] and we summarize and conclude in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we base our conclusions on 5 dark matter only n - body simulations of a @xmath7cdm cosmology with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , in agreement with a wide array of observations .",
    "the initial conditions were generated at @xmath13 using the zeldovich approximation applied to a regular , cartesian grid of particles .",
    "our two highest resolution simulations employed @xmath14 equal mass particles ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) in boxes of side @xmath17 and @xmath18mpc with plummer equivalent smoothings of @xmath19 and @xmath20kpc .",
    "they were evolved to @xmath4 using the _ treepm _ code described in @xcite ( for a comparison with other codes see * ? ? ?",
    "we ran 3 additional , smaller simulations in a @xmath21mpc box , one with @xmath22 particles and two with @xmath23 particles ( each started at @xmath24 ) .",
    "a comparison of the boxes allows us to check for finite volume , finite mass and finite force resolution effects .",
    "we shall comment on each where appropriate .",
    "the phase space data for the particles were dumped at @xmath25 outputs spaced by @xmath26myr from @xmath27 to @xmath4 for all but the largest box .",
    "the lower resolution of the largest box makes it less useful for merger trees , so it was sampled for only subset of these output times , ending at @xmath4 . for each output",
    "we generate a catalog of halos using the friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm @xcite with a linking length , @xmath28 , of @xmath29 times the mean inter - particle spacing .",
    "this partitions the particles into equivalence classes , by linking together all particle pairs separated by less than @xmath28 .",
    "the halos correspond roughly to particles with @xmath30 times the background density .",
    "we also made catalogs using a linking length of @xmath31 times the mean inter - particle spacing , which we shall discuss further below .",
    "we found that the fof algorithm with a larger linking length had a tendency to link together halos which we would , by eye , have characterized as separate ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* for similar discussion ) .",
    "this problem is mitigated with our more conservative choice of @xmath28 .",
    "for each halo we compute a number of properties , including the potential well depth , peak circular velocity , the position of the most bound particle ( which we take to define the halo center ) and @xmath32 , the mass interior to a radius , @xmath33 , within which the mean density is @xmath34 times the background density .",
    "our @xmath32 masses should thus be comparable to the sum of the particles in an @xmath35 group  a common definition that employs both the @xmath35 halo finder and definition of mass . ] . as discussed in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the choice of halo mass is problematic and ultimately one of convention .",
    "we shall return to this issue in the next section .",
    "merger trees are computed from the set of halo catalogs by identifying for each halo a `` child '' at a later time .",
    "the child is defined as that halo which contains , at the later time step , more than half of the particles in the parent halo at the earlier time step ( weighting each particle equally ) .",
    "for the purposes of tracking halos this simple linkage between outputs suffices ( note that we do not attempt to track subhalos within larger halos , which generally requires greater sophistication ) .",
    "two examples of the halo merger trees are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : treeplot ] , where we see a rich set of behaviours , including major and minor mergers and many body mergers . from the merger trees it is straightforward to compute the time when a halo ` falls in ' to a larger halo , the number and masses of the progenitors etc .    due to finite computational resources",
    ", all n - body simulations must trade - off computational volume for mass resolution . by running multiple simulations we can overcome this to some extent , but not entirely .",
    "we have chosen to slightly under - resolve the low mass ( @xmath36k ) halos in order to simulate a slightly larger volume , since our focus will be on the more massive halos which have more frequent major mergers . under reasonable assumptions ( see below ) between @xmath37 off all photon production occurs in halos more massive than @xmath38 at @xmath4 , and we easily resolve these objects with the @xmath39mpc simulation which we use for the bulk of the paper .",
    "the highest mass objects in our volume have mass @xmath40 and radii of several tens of kpc . at @xmath4",
    "these halos are analogous to rich clusters today , being recently formed and rare : fig .",

    "most previous work finds mass functions which are better fit by the @xcite , @xcite or @xcite form .",
    "we find that the appropriate mass function to use depends primarily on the definition of mass chosen and definitions which at @xmath52 give very similar mass functions can give quite different ones at @xmath4 .",
    "we show the mass function(s ) from our three highest resolution simulations in fig .",
    "[ fig : nofm ] .",
    "if we use as our mass estimator the sum of the particle masses in the fof(0.2 ) groups ( open symbols ) then we find good agreement with the @xcite or @xcite forms .",
    "this is the procedure followed by most of the groups above to 22% over the mass range plotted .",
    "see , e.g.  @xcite for further discussion . ] . however if we choose instead to use @xmath32 as our mass estimator ( filled symbols ) we find a different mass function .",
    "although this mass function shows a marked excess of high mass halos compared to the @xcite form , it is a better fit than the alternate forms mentioned above .",
    "agreeably , for the scales plotted , the @xmath32 mass function is independent of the initial fof group catalog used to define the centers about which @xmath32 is determined .",
    "this is not too surprising as the group centers hardly change and the number of `` small '' groups which split off of larger fof groups as the linking length is decreased is tiny compared to the number of low - mass `` field '' halos .",
    "the differences in mass functions then comes primarily from the definition of the masses of the found objects . comparing halo by halo the fof(0.2 )",
    "masses are almost twice @xmath32 , though the difference depends on mass .",
    "a similar difference was also noted by @xcite as a shift to lower abundance at fixed mass when comparing an fof(0.2)-based mass function to that of a different halo finder .",
    "we believe the primary issue is not the halo finder , but the mass definition .",
    "their second halo finder assigns masses which are essentially our @xmath32 .",
    "the mass discrepancy is much larger for these halos at @xmath4 than it is for group and cluster - sized halos at the present day ( e.g. figure 11 in * ? ? ?",
    "the mass differences are quite interesting .",
    "the historical argument for choosing fof(0.2 ) was that the fof group finder selects particles approximately within a density @xmath53 times the mean density . for a singular isothermal sphere profile ( @xmath54 ) and a critical density universe",
    "the mean enclosed density is thus @xmath55 , in accord with arguments based on spherical top - hat collapse ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at @xmath4",
    "the universe is close to critical density so we might expect the fof(0.2 ) and @xmath32 mass functions to agree better than at lower @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "however , we are focusing on very high mass halos which have only recently formed at @xmath4 .",
    "they are therefore less centrally concentrated for halos of the form proposed by @xcite .",
    "] than a ` typical ' halo .",
    "this can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] , where halo profiles are compared to the isothermal sphere profile . as the halo profiles are less steep than the isothermal sphere form assumed in the argument above , this leads to the differences in mass between the fof(0.2 ) and @xmath35 definitions .",
    "by contrast , we find that the fof(0.168 ) mass function is very similar to the @xmath32 points plotted , and a halo by halo comparison shows that the two masses agree to within 20 - 30 per cent .",
    "as we go down the mass function , to more concentrated , lower mass halos , we expect fof(0.2 ) to better match @xmath32 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ".    in general , given the strong dependence of the mass function upon the mass definition , and the ambiguity in this quantity in many analytic treatments , significant care must be taken when making predictions for the abundance of halos . even if we decide to treat all halos as a simple 1-parameter family , it is likely preferable to make comparisons with some quantity more directly related to observables ( such as circular velocity , halo virial temperature or potential well depth ) or to discuss statistics as a function of number density rather than mass .",
    "like rich clusters we expect that these massive halos , in the process of formation , will not lie on the usual ` vacuum ' virial relation 2ke@xmath58pe , where ke and pe refer to the potential and kinetic energy respectively .",
    "in fact we find that 2ke / pe@xmath59 for halos in the range @xmath60 , very similar to the value found for rich clusters today @xcite .",
    "a similar ` excess ' kinetic energy was also found by @xcite for lower mass halos . the ratio is larger than unity because of the steady accretion of material onto the cluster @xcite .",
    "[ fig : bias ] shows the clustering of the dark matter and the halos from our @xmath18mpc run .",
    "we plot the auto - correlation function of the dark matter and the cross - correlation of the halo centers with the dark matter respectively .",
    "the latter is both less subject to noise , and jackknife errors on the cross - correlation , @xmath61 , are a few percent for the samples shown .",
    "jackknife drastically underestimates the errors from finite volume however . ] from our small sample of massive halos and more applicable to understanding how radiation from the halos would influence the surrounding mass .",
    "the ratio of the cross- to auto - correlation functions defines the scale dependent bias , @xmath62 .",
    "the mass auto - correlation function is in good agreement between the @xmath17 and @xmath18mpc boxes up to @xmath63mpc , with @xmath64 from the @xmath39mpc box falling below that of the @xmath18mpc box beyond this scale .",
    "the @xmath21mpc box has noticeably less power over a wide range of scales . for the masses where we can compare and for the range of linear scales plotted , the halo - mass cross - correlation functions of the @xmath17 and @xmath18mpc boxes are in excellent agreement",
    ", so we have shown the results only for the @xmath18mpc box",
    ".    our halo samples are mass thresholded , however by using number density as our marker we largely avoid the issues of mass definition discussed earlier .",
    "the differences in bias at fixed @xmath65 for the different mass choices , arising from the scatter between different mass definitions , is only a few percent .",
    "taking @xmath66 as the asymptotic value , the large - scale bias is in good agreement with the models of @xcite and @xmath67 higher than that of @xcite .",
    "those of @xcite and @xcite lie in between .",

    ". this mass function is then used when analytically computing the halo - weighted bias @xmath70 from each of the analytic forms which provide @xmath71 . because of this the @xcite bias function is the only one which would give an average bias of unity when integrated over @xmath69 .",

    "as expected , the clustering strength is an increasing function of mass @xcite , or a decreasing function of halo abundance .",
    "we now consider the hierarchical assembly of the dark matter halos through merging and accretion .",
    "we shall use the @xmath14 , @xmath39mpc simulation since it provides both high mass resolution and a representative volume . since",
    "our progenitor relationships are based on particles in the fof groups , we use the fof(0.168 ) masses for consistency .",
    "as discussed earlier , for our massive halos these masses are within @xmath73 per cent of @xmath32 and none of our conclusions depend sensitively on this choice .",

    "the fraction decreases for smaller mass ratios and for lower mass halos , as expected .",

    "the agreement is reasonably good . at the low mass end",
    "eps significantly underpredicts the number of predecessors found in our simulations ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "at the high mass end the eps rate starts to climb rapidly , eventually diverging unphysically .",
    "these trends are independent of the final mass chosen , or the definition of mass used . the eps formula as progenitor mass goes to zero also diverges , which we could not approach due to our finite mass resolution , but the mass weighted eps calculation is finite at both ends .",
    "there is another notable difference between eps and our simulation .",
    "though it is relatively small , our time step is still too large for all mergers to be truly 2-body ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : treeplot ] ) , as implicitly assumed by eps .",
    "a large fraction ( 20 - 50 per cent , depending on @xmath80 ) of the halos are actually produced in 3 ( or more)-body mergers .",
    "finally we also looked for evidence that recently merged halos clustered differently than randomly chosen halos of the same mass .",
    "the correlation function of 1:2 or 1:3 mergers appeared to be slightly ( @xmath85 ) enhanced at @xmath86mpc compared to the random sample , but the number of merged halos was too small for this to be statistically meaningful .",

    "this suggests that the clustering of massive halos does not depend strongly upon their recent merger history .",
    "this in turn significantly eases the modeling of merger - related processes , such as enhanced photon production during reionization which we now discuss .",

    "it is reasonable to anticipate that the mergers of large dark matter halos could have similar effects on the photon production rate of the sources within them .",
    "we will make this assumption , and then consider the consequences of the merger rates computed above for the photon production distribution .",
    "we frame our discussion in terms of a simple but promising model for reionization proposed by @xcite , though our result is true more generally . in these models , a halo of a given mass @xmath87 ( in units of some reference mass )",
    "is considered a source of photons with rate @xmath88 usually @xmath89 is taken to be mass independent , scale as @xmath90 or transition from @xmath90 to @xmath91 at @xmath92 ( @xcite , motivated by @xcite ) .",
    "a region around these halos is taken to be ionized if the photons within it are sufficient to ionize all the interior mass .",
    "some extensions also give recombinations spatial and/or temporal dependence and incorporate this into finding the bubble properties @xcite , or incorporate eq .",

    "the morphology of ionized regions can be computed from the photon production rate and spatial distribution of dark matter halos .    a first step at including halo mergers within the above formalism ( and its generalizations )",
    "was presented in @xcite .",
    "those calculations were based on the press - schechter formalism , and so could only provide average numbers of mergers for halos in a given mass range ; scatter was computed by assuming that the mergers had a poisson distribution . with our simulations we are able to check these assumptions and significantly extend this work because we have access to the detailed merger history of each halo .",
    "this allows us to go beyond their analytic estimates to explicitly calculate the full distribution of photon production for a halo of mass @xmath87 , taking into account the distribution of histories and their associated ( and different ) photon production rates for a fixed @xmath87 .    from the merger tree for each halo at @xmath4 ( @xmath93 )",
    "we identify which progenitors had at least one major merger ( greater than 1:3 or 1:10 ) , and the time @xmath94 they occurred .",
    "we include all of the mergers in the tree and we place @xmath94 at random within the @xmath26myr interval between the relevant outputs .",
    "each of these mergers is allowed to contribute `` excess '' photons beyond those which would automatically be assigned to the halo on the basis of its @xmath4 mass , @xmath95 , but the number of photons contributed is exponentially attenuated with an @xmath96-folding time @xmath97 .",
    "the `` excess '' photon production is thus proportional to @xmath98 where the sum is over all halos which have undergone a major merger and we take @xmath99 or @xmath100 .",
    "the exponential decay is motivated by modeling of starbursts , e.g.  @xcite , hence the subscript @xmath101 .",

    "we denote this by a subscript @xmath108 , to indicate photon production by black holes , which might have their photon production rate increase over time and then decay once the fuel is exhausted . assuming a step - like function is a crude first approximation to this uncertain physics . in all cases",
    "we take the quiescent photon production to depend on the @xmath4 halo mass with the same index , @xmath109 , as @xmath110 .",
    "we note this prescription might cause some overcounting if many mergers occur within a short time period and the gas becomes depleted from the earliest ones .",
    "a more refined model would account for the evolving baryon budget within the halo , but our treatment is sufficient for the purpose of illustration .",
    "the relative amplitudes of these two modes of photon production depend on a number of different factors ( see e.g. @xcite for discussion and summary of estimates at these redshifts ) but a factor @xmath111 is not unreasonable for starbursts and could be even larger for black holes .",
    "the total photon production is thus enhanced by a factor @xmath112 for the `` starburst '' prescription , or its analogue @xmath113 for the `` black hole '' prescription . in principle both can contribute .",
    "we considered the two effects separately , their combination is straightforward .",
    "figure [ fig : enhance ] shows a typical example of the cumulative distribution of enhancement factors , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : enhance ] ) .",
    "we took the starburst form , 1:3 mergers , @xmath114 , @xmath115myr and @xmath116 , but other cases are very similar .",
    "the enhancement distribution is extended , with a long tail to high @xmath117 and a peak at those halos which have not merged .",
    "about half of the halos have twice the photon production , while 20 per cent have no enhancement .",
    "choosing a larger @xmath118 increases the size of the enhancement , but does not qualitatively change the form of the distribution .",
    "similarly , changing @xmath109 or @xmath97 changes the detailed form of the distribution but not its character .",
    "halos down to @xmath119 show a very similar distribution of enhancements .",
    "by contrast the model for black hole accretion produces a bimodal distribution , as the `` early '' mergers contribute relatively more than in the case of the starbursts , leading to a second peak .",
    "even though the scatter in photon contributions from halo to halo is large for a given mass , if a large number of such halos are found in a bubble , their contributions to the photon numbers will tend to the mean , allowing the distribution to be replaced by the average . precisely counting",
    "the number of halos of a given mass and the combined photon scatter inside a typical bubble is unfortunately self - referential : changing the ionization properties ( including mergers ) changes the bubble sizes and thus the number of halos within .",
    "different assumptions about the nature of the sources and their feedback can give drastically different bubble sizes , and the relative importance of high vs.  lower mass halos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given these uncertainties we consider properties in an average volume , for illustration .",
    "for quiescent photon production and @xmath120 , analytic estimates such as press - schechter give that halos with @xmath121 contribute between @xmath37 of all photons .",
    "even choosing @xmath122 , such halos contribute @xmath12310 per cent of the photons .",
    "the number density of such halos is @xmath124 .",
    "bubble radii in different models range over several orders of magnitude .",
    "a middle - of - the - road estimate is @xmath125mpc , which would contain about 3 halos with @xmath121 .",
    "the bubble radius would also be larger than the correlation length of our halos , so clustering is only expected to change this number by a factor of order unity .",
    "a small number of halos contributing a large fraction of the photons means that scatter in their photon production should affect the properties of the bubbles .",
    "our calculation is relatively crude , but it suggests that the inclusion of mergers into a more refined model of reionization could alter the distribution of ionized regions . for models based on approximate dynamics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a possible first step would be to assign a merger history to the sources at random .",

    "we present results specifically for @xmath4 , but the evolution of the populations is smooth and the results will be similar at slightly higher and lower redshift . like the halos of rich groups or clusters today the halos we consider are in the process of forming , growing rapidly through accretions and mergers .",
    "we found that they had larger velocity dispersions than a naive application of the virial theorem would predict , due to a surface pressure from infalling material . being recently formed , the halos were not very centrally concentrated , leading to a factor of two difference between fof(0.2 ) masses and @xmath32 .",
