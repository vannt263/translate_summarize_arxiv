    "cross sections for neutrino - nucleus interactions are some of the most important data required to reliably estimate the @xmath3li and @xmath4b yields in supernovae .",
    "the @xmath2-process cross sections have been evaluated for a wide range of nuclear species in @xcite .",
    "the data are tabulated in hoffman & woosley ( 1992 , hereafter referred to as hw92 ) . since the evaluation by hw92 , further development of shell model calculations now enable us to more accurately evaluate these essential cross sections .",
    "the @xmath2-process cross sections are often presented as a function of neutrino temperature , based on averaging energy dependent cross sections over a fermi - dirac distribution of given temperature and chemical potential ( for simplicity often assumed to be zero ) .",
    "however , it is more appropriate to consider the energy dependence as the primary information , as studies of sn neutrino transport show that their spectra do not exactly follow fermi - dirac distributions with zero - chemical potential ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , when considering neutrino oscillations in sne , the spectra are non - thermal after the neutrino flavors change , even if the fermi - dirac distribution approximates the spectra at the neutrino sphere reasonably well ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the main purpose of this study is the re - evaluation of neutrino - nucleus reaction cross section for @xmath1c and @xmath0he using new shell - model hamiltonians .",
    "we evaluate the branching ratios of many decay channels for light element species .",
    "then , we evaluate the yields of the light elements , @xmath8li , @xmath3li , @xmath9be , @xmath7be , @xmath7b , and @xmath4b and discuss their production processes .",
    "we re - estimate the allowed range of the neutrino temperatures derived from constraints on the sn contribution of @xmath4b in gce models ( following * ? ? ?",

    "the range of the neutrino temperature is @xmath275 for wbp+sfo model and @xmath276 for the spsdmk+psdmk2 model .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath3li and @xmath4b yields on neutrino oscillation parameters , such as mass hierarchy and the mixing angle @xmath14 , is not changed by the new cross sections .",
    "yield enhancements are smaller .",
    "the @xmath3li/@xmath4b abundance ratio depends on mass hierarchy and the mixing angle @xmath14 , even when considering uncertainties of neutrino temperatures and the total neutrino energy . for a normal mass hierarchy and @xmath238 ,",
    "i.e. , adiabatic h resonance , the @xmath3li/@xmath4b ratio is larger than 0.78 . in the case of an inverted mass hierarchy or the case without neutrino oscillations , the @xmath3li/@xmath4b ratio is smaller than 0.61 .",
    "smaller uncertainty of neutrino temperatures extends the difference in the @xmath3li/@xmath4b ratio .",
