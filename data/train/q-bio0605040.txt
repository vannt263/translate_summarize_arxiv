    "figure [ fig1 ] illustrates the general features of an epidemic outbreak on a population structured in different communities . starting from an index case a disease spreads widely inside a community thanks to the frequent intra - community interactions .",
    "in addition the disease is transmitted to other communities via individuals belonging to different communities .",
    "while the inter - community interactions may be rare they are determinant to understand the overall outbreak progression . based on this picture",
    "i divide the population in two types or classes .",
    "the _ locals _ belonging to a single community and the social _ bridges _ belonging to different communities . in a first approximation",
    "i assume that ( i ) all communities are statistically equivalent , ( ii ) the mixing between the local and bridges is homogeneous , and ( iii ) social bridges belong to two populations . while these assumptions are off course approximations they allow us to gain insight into the problem . they could be relaxed in future works to include other factors such as degree correlations among interacting individuals @xcite and more realistic mixing patterns @xcite .",
    "an epidemic outbreak taking place inside a community is then modeled by a a multi - type branching process @xcite starting from an index case ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the key intra - community magnitudes are the reproductive number and the generation times @xcite .",
    "the reproductive number is the average number of secondary cases generated by a primary case .",
    "the disease transmission introduces some biases towards individuals that interact more often .",
    "therefore , i make an explicit distinction between the index case and other primary cases and denote their expected reproductive numbers by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the generation time @xmath2 is the time elapse from the infection of a primary case and the infection of a secondary case .",

    "the epidemics started with an increasing tendency of the incidence which , after reaching a maximum , switched to a decreasing trend .",
    "after some years , however , the epidemics resurges with a new incidence increase .",
    "this picture coincides with the model predictions in fig .",
    "therefore , a possible explanation of the observed multiple peaks is the existence of a community structure , which can be attributed to geographical location and other factors .",
    "@xmath45 in ( [ betac ] ) represents the expected number of infected individuals leaving their community .",
    "the numerical simulations reported in @xcite indicated the existence of a transition at @xmath57 , from local outbreaks when @xmath35 to global epidemics when @xmath58 .",
    "i have demonstrated that there is indeed a phase transition at @xmath57 .",
    "furthermore , the analytical solution provides an expression of @xmath45 as a function of the bridge s fraction and the intra - community expected outbreak size ( [ p0 ] ) .",
    "@xmath45 represents a measure of the reproductive number at the inter - community level .",
    "its value can be estimated from the expected outbreak size inside a community and the bridge s fraction . based on the resulting estimate",
    "we can determine if an epidemics is in the local or global epidemics scenario and react accordingly .",
    "the inter - community disease transmission is characterized by oscillations at the early stages which represents resurgent epidemics , the number of these resurgencies being determined by the characteristic distance between individuals within a community .",
    "in essence , when @xmath4 is small the time scale characterizing the outbreak progression within a community is very small @xcite .",
    "therefore , the time it takes to observe the infection of a social bridge is very small as well , resulting in the mixing between the intra- and inter - community transmissions .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath4 is large it takes a longer time to observe the infection of a social bridge and by that time the intra - community outbreak has significantly developed . therefore , in this last case the outbreak within communities is partially segregated in time .    when multi - agent models are not available these results allow us to evaluate the potential progression of an epidemic outbreak and consequently determine the magnitude of our response to halt it .",
    "they are also valuable when a detailed metapolpulation model is available , funneling the search for key quantities among the several model parameters .",
