    "let @xmath8 be an elliptic curve defined over a number field  @xmath1 , and @xmath0 a prime .",
    "it is easy to show that , if @xmath8 possesses a @xmath1-rational @xmath0-isogeny , then the reduction @xmath9 , for all primes  @xmath10 of  @xmath1 of good reduction and not dividing @xmath0 , likewise possesses an @xmath11-rational @xmath0-isogeny .    in @xcite , andrew sutherland asked a converse question : if @xmath9 admits an @xmath11-rational @xmath0-isogeny for a density one set of primes @xmath10 , then does @xmath12 admit a @xmath1-rational @xmath0-isogeny ?",
    "sutherland showed that , while the answer to this question is usually `` yes '' , there nevertheless exist pairs @xmath13 for which the answer is `` no '' .",
    "whether an elliptic curve over a field possesses a rational @xmath0-isogeny or not depends only on its @xmath4-invariant , provided that the @xmath4-invariant is neither  @xmath14 nor  @xmath15 ; thus , if the answer is `` no '' for one elliptic curve  @xmath12 for the prime @xmath0 , it is also `` no '' for every elliptic curve over @xmath1 with the same @xmath4-invariant @xmath16 ( with the same exceptions ) . following sutherland , we thus define a pair @xmath17 , consisting of a prime  @xmath0 and an element  @xmath18 of a number field @xmath1 , to be * exceptional for @xmath1 * if there exists an elliptic curve @xmath8 over @xmath1 , with @xmath19 , such that the answer to the above question at @xmath0 is `` no '' .",
    "we will refer to the prime in the exceptional pair as an * exceptional prime for @xmath1 * , and any elliptic curve @xmath8 over @xmath1 with @xmath19 as a * hasse at @xmath0 curve over @xmath1*.    sutherland gives a necessary condition for the existence of an exceptional pair , under a certain assumption . to state sutherland s result , recall that the absolute galois group @xmath20 acts on the @xmath0-torsion subgroup @xmath21 $ ] , yielding the mod-@xmath0 representation @xmath22 whose image @xmath23 is well - defined up to conjugacy ; we refer to @xmath24 as _ the mod-@xmath0 image of @xmath8_. we let @xmath25 modulo scalars , and observe that @xmath26 depends only upon @xmath16 , provided that @xmath27 or 1728 ; we refer to @xmath26 as _ the projective mod-@xmath0 image of @xmath8_.    it is easy to show that @xmath28 is not an exceptional prime for any number field , so henceforth we assume that @xmath0 is odd .",
    "we now define @xmath29 , where the plus sign is taken if @xmath30 , and the minus sign otherwise .",
    "sutherland s result may now be stated as follows ; by @xmath31 we mean the dihedral group of order @xmath32 .    [ suther ]",

    "( in fact , the converse is also true , as may be shown by applying the proof of the converse part of proposition  [ p3 ] below ; see section  [ sec : pf - gp ] . )",
    "sutherland used this result for @xmath40 to determine the exceptional pairs for @xmath2 ( where the assumption  @xmath41 is trivially satisfied for all @xmath0 ) .",
    "if @xmath42 is exceptional for @xmath2 , then ( 3 ) above says that @xmath8 corresponds to a @xmath2-point on the modular curve @xmath43 . by the recent work of bilu , parent and rebolledo @xcite",
    ", it follows that @xmath0 must be 2,3,5,7 or 13 . of these , only 3 and @xmath44 are @xmath45 , and @xmath46 can easily be ruled out as a possible exceptional prime ( for all number fields ) .",
    "thus , @xmath44 is the only possible exceptional prime for @xmath2 , and ( 1 ) above tells us that the projective mod-@xmath44 image of a hasse at @xmath44 curve over @xmath2 must be isomorphic to @xmath47 , the dihedral group of order  @xmath48 .",
    "the modular curve parametrising elliptic curves with this specific level-7 structure turns out to be the rational elliptic curve with label 49a3 in @xcite , which has precisely two non - cuspidal rational points .",
    "evaluating @xmath4 at these points yields the same value , and hence gives sutherland s second result .",
    "[ suth2 ] @xmath49 is the only exceptional pair for @xmath2 .    in this paper",

    "thus , in the case @xmath50 , there are two sorts of exceptional pairs ; the * dihedral ones * , and the * non - dihedral ones*.    let us now consider each of these two cases over @xmath59 , the smallest field containing @xmath60 . regarding the dihedral pairs , we may ask the following question .",

    "@xmath50 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath122 .",
    "the equivalence of ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) is clear .",
    "the equivalent of ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) follows from standard galois theory upon observing that the determinant of @xmath123 is equal to the mod-@xmath0 cyclotomic character over @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath82 is an elliptic curve with @xmath124 , then after base - changing to @xmath73 the projective image is intersected with @xmath125 , and becomes isomorphic to  @xmath74 .",
    "this argument uses the fact that @xmath126 .",
    "we would like to briefly mention the cartan subgroups of @xmath38 ; for a complete treatment see chapter xviii ,  12 of @xcite .",
    "there are two sorts of cartan subgroup , * split * and * non - split*. a split cartan subgroup is conjugate to the group of diagonal matrices , and hence is isomorphic to @xmath127 .",
    "its normaliser is then conjugate to the group @xmath128 of diagonal and antidiagonal matrices .",
    "a non - split cartan subgroup is isomorphic to @xmath129 , and is conjugate to the group @xmath130 defined as follows : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is any fixed quadratic non - residue in @xmath133 .",
    "it also has index two in its normaliser @xmath134 .",
    "associated to both of the groups @xmath128 and @xmath134 are modular curves @xmath43 and @xmath135 respectively ; these serve as coarse moduli spaces for elliptic curves @xmath8 whose mod-@xmath0 galois image @xmath24 is contained in ( a conjugate of ) @xmath128 and @xmath134 respectively . both curves are geometrically connected and defined over @xmath2 . over the complex numbers each curve has the description of being the quotient of the extended upper half plane @xmath136 by an appropriate congruence subgroup .",
    "the curve @xmath43 is @xmath2-isomorphic to the quotient @xmath137 of the modular curve @xmath138 by the fricke involution . over @xmath139 , this isomorphism",
    "is established by mapping @xmath140 on @xmath137 to @xmath141 on @xmath43 .",
    "one of sutherland s insights was that the notion of hasse at @xmath0 curve @xmath8 over @xmath1 depends only on the projective mod-@xmath0 image @xmath26 .",
    "given a subgroup @xmath142 of @xmath5 , we say that @xmath142 is * hasse * if its natural action on @xmath143 satisfies the following two properties :    * every element @xmath144 fixes a point in @xmath143 ; * there is no point in @xmath143 fixed by the whole of @xmath142 .",
    "we then have the following :    [ hasse ] an elliptic curve @xmath12 is hasse at @xmath0 if and only if @xmath26 is hasse .",
    "this allows us to reduce the study of exceptional pairs largely to group theory .",
    "throughout this proof , @xmath145 .    let @xmath12 have @xmath64 .",
    "it follows from dickson s classification of subgroups of @xmath38 ( see @xcite ) that @xmath146 is contained in the normaliser of a cartan subgroup .",
    "if this cartan subgroup were non - split , then @xmath146 would be contained in @xmath147 ( we take the intersection by lemma  [ lemma ] ) , and so @xmath148 would be contained in @xmath149 , which is a group of size  @xmath48 , and hence can not contain a subgroup isomorphic to @xmath71 ; thus @xmath150 , and so @xmath12 corresponds to a @xmath1-point on @xmath6 .",
    "the converse is not quite true ; a @xmath1-point on @xmath6 corresponds to an elliptic curve @xmath151 over @xmath1 with @xmath152 , but not necessarily equal to @xmath71 .",
    "we now give an expression for the @xmath4-map @xmath153 .",
    "since @xmath154 is isomorphic to @xmath6 under the map @xmath155 , it suffices to write down the function @xmath156 in terms of a hauptmodul @xmath157 for @xmath154 .",
    "let @xmath158 be a hauptmodul for @xmath159 .",
    "klein found the following formula in 1879 : @xmath160 we can look up an expression for @xmath161 in terms of @xmath162 from @xcite : @xmath163 we also know that the fricke involution @xmath164 maps @xmath162 to @xmath165 .",
    "hence a hauptmodul for @xmath154 is @xmath166 .",
    "it follows that @xmath167 inserting a @xmath1-value for @xmath157 in this expression yields the @xmath4-invariant of an elliptic curve @xmath8 over @xmath1 with @xmath69 .",
    "the condition on @xmath168 in the statement of the theorem ensures that we have equality here , by ensuring that the image is not contained in any one of the three subgroups of order  @xmath169 in  @xmath71 , as we now demonstrate .",
    "let @xmath8 be a curve in @xmath170 corresponding to a choice of @xmath157 in @xmath1 , so that @xmath171 .",
    "the following statements are readily seen to be equivalent to @xmath172 :    * @xmath148 is cyclic .",
    "* @xmath146 is contained in ( a conjugate of ) @xmath173 .",
    "* @xmath8 has a pair of independent @xmath1-rational 5-isogenies .",
    "* @xmath8 pulls back to a @xmath1-point on @xmath174 . *",
    "@xmath175 .",
    "since @xmath162 is a root of the polynomial @xmath176 of discriminant @xmath168 , we have @xmath175 if and only if @xmath67 is a square in @xmath1 .",
    "thus the statement that @xmath168 is not a square in @xmath1 is equivalent to @xmath148 not being cyclic , and hence @xmath177 .",
    "we have , however , overlooked an issue above . for a given @xmath178 satisfying ,",
    "there are two other values of @xmath179 also satisfying .",
    "this is because the field extension @xmath180 , which has degree  @xmath181 and is not galois , has automorphism group of order  @xmath46 , generated by @xmath182 .",
    "we must ensure that for none of the galois conjugate values is  @xmath183 square in  @xmath1 , so that @xmath148 is not contained in any of the three cyclic subgroups of  @xmath71 .",
    "this explains the final condition in the statement of the theorem .    to illustrate this theorem ,",
    "we input @xmath184 to obtain @xmath185 we check that the other two values of @xmath186 , namely @xmath187 and @xmath188 , do not satisfy @xmath168 is a square , and hence any elliptic curve over @xmath63 with this @xmath4 has @xmath64 .",
    "equivalently , the pair @xmath189 is exceptional for @xmath63 .",
    "however , if we input @xmath190 , we get @xmath191 and whilst @xmath192 does satisfy @xmath168 not being a square , this is not the case for @xmath193 , which yields the same @xmath4-value .",
    "one therefore has to be careful of these `` pretenders '' , hence the last paragraph of the above proof",
    ".    we can even insert rational values of @xmath157 , such as @xmath194 , to obtain elliptic curves over @xmath2 whose basechange to @xmath63 are hasse at 5 , e.g. , @xmath195",

    "the curve depends only on the intersection of @xmath196 with @xmath201 .",

    "steven galbraith describes a method to compute the canonical model of any modular curve @xmath205 , provided one can compute explicitly and to some precision the @xmath206-expansions of a basis of @xmath207 , the weight-2 cuspforms of level @xmath208 ( a congruence subgroup ) .",
    "hence , to compute the desired equation , we are reduced to computing explicitly a basis of the finite - dimensional @xmath139-vector space @xmath209 .",

    "our desired 3-dimensional space is then the subspace of @xmath213 fixed by @xmath74 : @xmath214 that is , the @xmath74-invariant subspace of the @xmath125-representation @xmath213 .",

    "the key observation , which proves the claim , is that sign@xmath470 must be 1 , because it coincides with @xmath471 .    as @xmath157 must be even , we look finally at to conclude that @xmath463 must divide @xmath468 with even remainder , and the lemma is proved .",
    "a part of the previous proof is worth framing , for it explains why the pullback of the dihedral group @xmath31 is contained in the normaliser of a _ split _ cartan subgroup .",
    "let @xmath454 be hasse , and let @xmath144 .",
    "let @xmath462 , and let @xmath464 be the pullback of @xmath465 to @xmath38 .",
    "then @xmath464 is contained in a split cartan subgroup .",
    "lemma  [ divides ] implies that the @xmath371 in @xmath31 divides @xmath36 , and also the congruence restrictions for @xmath74 , @xmath100 and @xmath460 ; indeed , since @xmath74 contains elements of order 1 , 2 and 3 , we must have that 2 and 3 divide @xmath36 , or equivalently , @xmath472 ; the same argument works for @xmath100 and @xmath460 .",
    "this proves the forward implication of the group theoretic proposition above .",
    "we now prove the converse , that is , if @xmath142 is isomorphic to one of the four subgroups listed above , then it satisfies the hasse condition .",
    "the easier thing to prove is that every element @xmath461 in @xmath142 fixes a point of @xmath143 , so we address this first .",
    "suppose , for a contradiction , that we have @xmath144 which fixes no point of @xmath143 , let @xmath463 be the order of this @xmath461 , and let @xmath473 be the number of orbits .",
    "proposition 2 of @xcite says that sign(@xmath461 ) = @xmath474 ; in particular , @xmath157 must be even . applying the orbit counting lemma to the action of @xmath475 on @xmath143 yields the",
    "formula @xmath476 , and hence @xmath463 must divide @xmath477 .",
    "we now do a case - by - case elimination .",
    "suppose first that @xmath458 with all the other conditions expressed above .",
    "the order of any element of this group must divide @xmath36 .",
    "since no numbers divide both @xmath36 and @xmath477 , we obtain the desired contradiction .",
    "the argument in the other cases is similar .",
    "we are left with proving that , in the four cases , no point of @xmath143 is fixed by the whole of @xmath142 .",
    "this follows from the following well - known fact from group theory ; see for example theorem 80.27 in @xcite .",
    "[ mackey ] let @xmath196 be a group , @xmath260 a transitive left @xmath196-set , and @xmath142 a subgroup of @xmath196",
    ". denote by @xmath478 the set of orbits of @xmath260 under @xmath142 .",
    "let @xmath479 denote the @xmath196-stabiliser of any point of @xmath260 .",
    "then we have an isomorphism of @xmath142-sets @xmath480 where @xmath228 runs over a set of double coset representatives for @xmath481 ; here we regard the @xmath260 on the left as an @xmath142-set .",
    "this allows us to prove that , in the four cases , there is no point of @xmath143 fixed by all of @xmath142 .",
    "we apply the lemma with @xmath482 , @xmath483 , and @xmath479 the stabiliser of @xmath484 , that is , the borel subgroup . by the lemma , an orbit of size  @xmath412 corresponds to a double coset representative @xmath228 for which @xmath485 . but this inclusion is impossible , since each @xmath142 contains @xmath71 and @xmath479 does not .",
    "this finishes the proof .",
    "let @xmath486 be a non - dihedral hasse at @xmath0 curve .",
    "then @xmath472 , @xmath487 or  @xmath488 , according as the projective image of  @xmath123 is @xmath74 , @xmath100 or  @xmath460 , by proposition  [ prop : ell - congruence ] .",
    "however , there is the following general result of david regarding the projective mod-@xmath489 image , for which we are grateful to nicolas billerey for bringing to our attention . for @xmath287 a number field , and @xmath489 a prime , let @xmath490 where @xmath491 denotes the ramification index of the prime @xmath492 .",
    "* lemme 2.4 ) for an elliptic curve defined over a number field @xmath287 , the projective mod-@xmath489 image contains an element of order at least  @xmath493 .    applying this with @xmath494 and @xmath495",
    ", we see that    * @xmath74 can occur only when @xmath496 and @xmath497 , so only for @xmath450 ; * @xmath100 can occur only when @xmath498 and @xmath499 , so can not occur ; * @xmath460 can occur only when @xmath500 and @xmath501 , so can not occur .",
    "thus only @xmath74 is possible , for the prime @xmath450 .",
    "over the complex numbers , there are precisely 3 modular curves of level 13 and genus  @xmath46 ; they are @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath7 ; see for example the table of @xcite .",
    "observe that all of these curves are defined over @xmath2 and are geometrically connected .",
    "in her recent work @xcite , @xcite , burcu baran proved , in two different ways , that the curves @xmath115 and @xmath116 are in fact @xmath2-isomorphic .",
    "her first proof in @xcite was computational ; she computed models of both curves and showed that they give isomorphic curves .",
    "her second proof was more conceptual , establishing that the jacobians @xmath502 and @xmath503 are isomorphic , with an isomorphism preserving the canonical polarisation of both jacobians ; the torelli theorem then gives the result .",
    "the @xmath2-points on @xmath115 have not yet been determined ; in fact , as discussed in the final section of @xcite , @xmath504 is the _ only _",
    "prime @xmath489 for which the @xmath2-points on @xmath505 have _ not _ yet been determined , and baran s result , linking @xmath115 and @xmath116 , may give some reason for why this @xmath504 case is so difficult : the determination of @xmath2-points on @xmath506 is known to be a difficult problem .",
    "another reason for this difficulty is that @xmath507 is likely to have mordell - weil rank 3 , which equals the genus , so the method of chabauty to determine the rational points does not apply . by likely , we mean that the analytic rank of this jacobian is 3 , so under the birch - swinnerton - dyer conjecture , we would have that the mordell - weil rank is also 3 .",
    "the curves @xmath115 and @xmath7 are _ not _ isomorphic , even over @xmath139 ; this may be verified using the explicit models of both curves , by computing certain invariants of genus  @xmath46 curves and observing that they are different  we are grateful to jeroen sijsling for carrying out this computation",
    ".    nevertheless , their jacobians are isogenous .",
    "the jacobians _",
    "@xmath502 _ and @xmath508 of the modular curves _",
    "@xmath115 _ and @xmath7 are @xmath2-isogenous .",
    "let @xmath509 , @xmath479 the borel subgroup of @xmath196 , and for @xmath1 any subgroup of @xmath510 , denote by @xmath511 the pullback of @xmath1 to @xmath196 .",
    "one first verifies ( for example in ) that there is a @xmath512$]-module isomorphism as follows :    @xmath513 \\oplus \\q[g/\\pb(c_{13}\\ltimes c_3 ) ] \\oplus \\q[g/\\pb(c_{13 } \\ltimes c_4 ) ] \\cong \\notag\\\\ & 2\\q[g/\\pb(s_4 ) ] \\oplus \\q[g/\\pb(d_{26 } ) ] \\oplus \\q[g / b].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for @xmath514 any @xmath2-algebra , apply the contravariant functor @xmath515}(-,j(13)(r))$ ] to this formula ; this yields , by a well - known method of kani and rosen ( @xcite , but see also @xcite ) , the following @xmath2-isogeny between jacobians of modular curves of level  @xmath72 :    @xmath516    here we have , for simplicity , denoted the jacobian of the modular curve @xmath517 simply as @xmath518 .",
    "however , as may be checked by computing genera of these curves , most of these terms are zero , leaving us with a @xmath2-isogeny @xmath519 restricting this isogeny to the first component yields an isogeny between @xmath520 and its image in @xmath521 .",
    "this image must have dimension 3 , and since @xmath522 is simple over @xmath2 ( as shown in section 2 of @xcite ) , the image is isogenous to @xmath522 .    one may still wonder whether @xmath522 is isomorphic to @xmath520 or not .",
    "they are indeed not isomorphic ; for if they were , then the arguments in section 3 of @xcite would apply , and we would conclude that the curves @xmath523 and @xmath524 were isomorphic , which we know is not true .    with additional",
    "work one may show that there is a @xmath2-isogeny between @xmath522 and @xmath520 of degree a power of 13 , and furthermore that 13 must divide the degree of any isogeny .",
    "there can be no hasse at @xmath111 curve over @xmath525 , because @xmath111 is not congruent to  @xmath526 ( see proposition  [ p3 ] ) .",
    "thus , we let @xmath1 be any other quadratic field .",
    "sutherland s result ( proposition  [ suther ] ) tells us that , if @xmath12 is a hasse at @xmath111 curve over @xmath1 , then it corresponds to a @xmath1-point on the modular curve @xmath527 . a model for this curve , as well as an expression for the @xmath4-map @xmath528 ,",
    "may be computed along the lines of that for @xmath7 ; we obtain a singular projective model @xmath529 we used  to search for @xmath1-points on this curve , for every quadratic field with absolute discriminant up to @xmath530 , and evaluated the @xmath4-map at these points , giving many potential @xmath4-invariants of hasse at @xmath111 curves over quadratic fields .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact , proved by igusa in @xcite , that , for an elliptic curve @xmath8 over any field @xmath287 , and an integer @xmath198 with char @xmath535 , the existence of a cyclic @xmath287-rational @xmath198-isogeny on @xmath8 is equivalent to @xmath536 $ ] having a linear factor .",
    "we found that , for all of our potential @xmath4-invariants , @xmath537 had many reductions with no linear factor ",
    "too many to be of density zero .",
    "this suggested to us that conjecture  [ co1 ] should be true .",
    "if 11 is unramified in @xmath1 and @xmath8 has a place @xmath538 of good or multiplicative reduction above 11 , then the results of @xcite ( see in particular section 4 ) gives the image of the inertia subgroup at @xmath538 of @xmath539 under @xmath540 , which in all cases is incompatible with the projective image being isomorphic with @xmath541 .",
    "we can also say , by part ( a ) of proposition  [ suther ] , that @xmath12 is hasse at 11 if and only if @xmath542 , and so corresponds to a @xmath1-point on the modular curve @xmath543 parametrising such elliptic curves .",
    "this modular curve is the @xmath525-twist of the more usual modular curve @xmath544 , which , by theorem 4.9 of @xcite , has only finitely many quadratic points .",
    "thus , we can say that there are only finitely many quadratic fields over which a hasse at 11 curve might exist .",
    "if we could determine exactly which quadratic fields @xmath1 arise for the twist @xmath543 of @xmath544 , we could prove the conjecture by determining the @xmath1-points on @xmath527 , find the finite list of potential @xmath4-invariants , and show that none of them yield @xmath545 ( this last step can be established by recent work of sutherland , who has implemented an algorithm to determine the mod-@xmath489 galois image of any elliptic curve over any number field ) .",
