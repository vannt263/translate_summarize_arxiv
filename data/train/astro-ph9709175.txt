    "since hubble ( 1926 , 1936 ) categorized galaxies according to their shapes , galaxy morphology has been used as a fundamental parameter in studies of galaxy formation and evolutionary processes .",
    "however , many galaxies have unusual morphologies and do not belong to any hubble type .",
    "most of these peculiar galaxies are interacting systems and had their forms distorted by tidal forces .",
    "therefore , interactions between galaxies are a major evolution mechanism which transform galaxy morphology during their evolution .",
    "the so - called toomre s sequence ( toomre 1977 ) is a perfect example of what happens to galaxy morphology during different stages of interaction .",
    "numerical simulations of the encounter between galaxies has established that gravitational interaction can not only originate tidal damage to spiral structures but also merge two disk galaxies in one final product which resembles an elliptical galaxy ( toomre & toomre 1972 , see barnes & hernquist 1992 for a review ) . in order to establish whether an encounter will originate a merger or not it is necessary to determine the physical properties and dynamics of the interaction . in principle",
    ", all systems made of galaxies with comparable mass and which are in elliptical bound orbits end as a merger but not necessarily within the hubble time ( binney & tremaine 1987 , junqueira & de freitas pacheco 1994 ) .",
    "if mergers are frequent in galaxy evolution we should be able to find mergers in progress such as ngc7252 and/or traces of the effect produced by this phenomenon .",
    "for instance , the most commonly associated features invoked by merger theory are bars , isophotes twisting , color gradient , shells , inner structures , dust , starbursts , agn s , etc ( schweizer 1983 , noguchi 1988 , bender et al .",
    "1989 , forbes & thomson 1992 ) . however , to what degree is the galaxy properties influenced by interactions with its neighbors is still an open issue .",
    "for instance , interaction involving at least one gas - rich galaxy may result in activity which may range from global starbusts to nuclear ones and to agn s , however it is unclear whether there is a transition between these three features ( fritze - v .",
    "alvensleben 1996 , keel 1996 ) .",
    "one of the most striking evidence for galaxy evolution is the faint blue galaxies excess at @xmath0 , i.e. the buchter & oemler effect ( butcher & oemler 1978 , 1984 ) . in order to explain this effect",
    ", galaxy evolution models need a mechanism for creating disturbed galaxies with enhanced star formation and explain why they occur more frequently at this redshift ( moore et al .",
    "moreover , they have to address the question of morphology evolution and an identification of the remnants of the distorted blue galaxies in the local universe .",
    "these issues have been the focus of major research efforts , largely triggered by the hubble deep field observations ( williams et al .",
    "1996 ) and the 10 m class telescope data which are becoming available now . however , despite the efforts made so far , fundamental questions , such as when , where and how galaxies form and evolve remain controversial .",
    "for instance , in hierarchical models for galaxy formation an individual galaxy may pass through various phases of disk or spheroid during its lifetime ( baugh et al.1996 ) .",
    "the authors claim that about 50% of all ellipticals ( but only about 15% of spirals ) would have undergone a major merger during the redshift interval 0.0 @xmath1 .",
    "however , the high degree of uniformity in ellipticals star formation history indicates that these objects must have formed at z @xmath2 2 ( bower et al . 1992 ) .",
    "an essential step towards answering these questions is understanding the properties of interacting galaxies in the local universe and comparing it with the more distant objects .",
    "we have started a long - term project focusing on these issues .",
    "our first step was to select a sample of faint interacting galaxies in pairs and groups . by faint we mean galaxies that are within @xmath3 and by interacting we mean angular separations of @xmath4 ( see infante et al .",
    "1996 , de mello et al .",
    "1997a , b for more details ) . among the more interesting results we find is the excess of faint pairs at intermediate redshift ( z@xmath50.35 ) .    in this paper",
    "we present a continuation of our previous work .",
    "we present a database of nearby pairs of galaxies that will be used in the future to compare with pairs at intermediate redshifts .",
    "the ideal sites to study galaxy encounters are pairs and groups of galaxies .",
    "the pioneers in the studies of pairs of galaxies are holmberg ( 1937 , 1958 ) and page ( 1952 , 1961 ) and more recently karachentsev ( 1972 ) .",
    "major effort has been focused into assembly complete samples of isolated pairs of galaxies for the southern hemisphere ( reduzzi & rampazzo , 1995 , soares et al . 1995 ; see sulentic 1992 for a review on the subject ) .",
    "several studies have analyzed the effect of interaction in binary galaxies , e.g. rampazzo & sulentic ( 1992 ) , rampazzo et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , de mello et al.(1996 ) , marquez & moles 1996 , reduzzi & rampazzo ( 1996 ) , and de souza et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "one simple approach in studying tidal effects is to analyze galaxy morphology in binary galaxies .",
    "a standard morphological classification of binaries is based on their components morphology .",
    "for instance , early  type binaries , usually called ee , are formed by two early  type galaxies and late  type binaries ( ss ) by two spiral galaxies .",
    "mixed morphology binaries , es , are formed by an early and a late  type galaxy .",
    "the observed fraction of the three types is 0.60 for ss , 0.30 for for es and 0.10 for ee ( sulentic 1992 ) .",
    "the existence of many isolated mixed binaries raises problems for models of galaxy formation that envision local environment as a major determinant of morphology",
    ". however , there are a few evidences , like morphological distortion in the late  type galaxy and young stellar population in the early  type showing that mixed binaries are physically interacting ( de mello et al . 1996 , rampazzo & sulentic 1992 ) .",
    "therefore , if mergers of spiral galaxies are the mechanism for the formation of ellipticals then binaries containing an elliptical would be the product of interaction between at least 3 galaxies . to understand whether galaxy transformation is a common phenomenon in galaxy evolution more studies of galaxy morphologies in interacting systems",
    "are needed . in this work we present the results of such analysis for a sample of binary galaxies .",
    "one of the most important goals of this study is to build a photometric and spectroscopic database in order to study interacting galaxy evolution .",
    "for this , the bright _ and _ faint pairs should constitute a carefully matched sample with projected separations such that the objects would be expected to merge in much less than a hubble time .    the faint ( @xmath6 ) sample was selected from automatic compiled catalogs of existing ( de mello et al .",
    "1997a , b ) ctio 4 m images at the equator ; the bright sample ( @xmath7 ) was selected from the catalog of isolated binary galaxies ( cpg ) compiled by karachentsev ( 1972 ) , which is the best available catalog that meets the local control sample requirements .",
    "pairs of faint galaxies ( separation @xmath8 ) were chosen such that @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 is the minimum separation at which pairs can be reliably separated ( nominally 2@xmath11 ) ; @xmath12 corresponds to some physical separation , @xmath13 , chosen so that : _ ( i ) _ physical pairs are doomed to merge in @xmath14yr ( on the basis of both empirical studies and conventional dynamics ) ; and _ ( ii ) _ most pairs in the faint sample are physically associated .",
    "these conditions are satisfied by @xmath15 kpc , which corresponds to @xmath16 at @xmath17 .",
    "what fraction of the faint pairs is expected to be physical pairs and merge ?",
    "infante et.al .",
    "( 1996 ) have calculated the angular correlation function , @xmath18 for pairs at @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "it follows that @xmath21 of faint pairs will be physically associated .",
    "furthermore , a cut in @xmath22 ( say @xmath23 km s@xmath24 ) should isolate most of the physical pairs .",
    "following carlberg et.al .",
    "( 1994 ) the fraction of galaxies that will merge is @xmath25 .",
    "thus , it is expected that @xmath26 of galaxies in pairs will eventually merge .",
    "the two samples should be affected by _",
    "identical _ selection effects .",
    "the cpg contains 603 binaries brighter than m@xmath27=15.7 , is the most complete catalog of binaries and has complete redshift information .",
    "in order to match the properties of z=0.35 pairs we looked at all karachentsev pairs with characteristics similar to what we expected for pairs at high z. we have selected all pairs with projected linear separation @xmath28 23 h@xmath24 kpc ( h@xmath24=100/h@xmath29kms@xmath24mpc@xmath24 ) and radial velocity difference @xmath28 420 kms@xmath24 .",
    "b , v and i images were taken at the cassegrain focus of the 2.2 m mpi / eso telescope with efosc2 , ccd19 ( 1024@xmath301024 with a scale of 0.336@xmath11pixel@xmath24 ) during 3 photometric nights in la silla , chile , in october 1994 .",
    "typical exposure times were 900s in b , 300s in v and 600s in i. observational conditions were photometric with an average seeing of 1.2@xmath11 .",
    "initial reductions followed standard procedures , and were performed with iraf .",
    "the bias level was subtracted from each image which were then divided by the averaged flat field exposure for the night . in figures 1 and 2",
    "we show the grey - scale v images of the 14 pairs in our sample .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the colors of pairs members follow the so - called holmberg effect which is a correlation between the colors of the pairs members ( holmberg 1954 , demin et al .",
    "1984 ) . in figure 7",
    "we show the ( b  v ) plot for each component ( a , b ) of the pairs .",
    "late - type pairs are marked as filled circles , early - type pairs as open circles and mixed - pairs as stars .",
    "reduzzi & rampazzo ( 1995 ) using a more complete sample found that while the colors of the members correlate significantly for ee and ss pairs , the correlation for es is less significant .",
    "it suggests that pairs of different morphologies should be analyzed differently . in pairs with two gas - rich components ( ss )",
    "tidal forces perturb the gas and the stars over the entire disk causing severe damage to both galaxies .",
    "ss pairs such as cpg551 and cpg587 have strong tails probably caused by the slow encounter between the galaxies .",
    "other ss pairs have barred galaxies probably also created by tidal effects . however , our sample is too small to allow any statistical analysis .",
    "four of our pairs are now confirmed to have a lenticular galaxy as a component .",
    "rampazzo et al .",
    "( 1992 and 1995 ) had also found an excess of lenticulars in their sample .",
    "in fact , they had estimated that 10 - 15% of all pairs classified as mixed pairs would in fact be disky pairs , i.e. formed by a spiral galaxy and a lenticular galaxy .",
    "this result suggests that s0 s could be the result of interaction .",
    "charlton et al . (",
    "1992 ) have proposed a toy - model for evolution of morphological types in a merger scenario which also agrees with our results .",
    "they have considered that mergers between unequal mass galaxies make s0 s and mergers between equal mass galaxies make ellipticals . in their model",
    "s - s0 pairs are formed from an initial group of 3 - 5 galaxies .",
    "the distortion on the isophotal shapes of elliptical galaxies are frequently used in studies of environmental effects as evidences of tidal effects . for instance , bender ( 1988 ) has suggested that elliptical galaxies can be classified according to their flatness and bender et al .",
    "( 1989 ) suggested that boxy isophotes are signs of past merger ( bender et al .",
    "caon & einasto ( 1995 ) have suggested that this property is more sensitive to the environment rather than the bulge / disk ratio .",
    "they found that disky elliptical galaxies are located in lower density environments and boxy ellipticals in higher densities .",
    "however , more recently , andreon ( 1996 ) using a more complete sample of galaxies in the coma cluster has suggested that diskiness and boxiness has no environmental origin . however , because our sample of galaxies is made of isolated pairs and that galaxies in clusters are more influenced by the cluster as a whole than by neighboring galaxies ( makino & hut 1997 ) it is possible that tidal effects on the internal properties of galaxies be more effective in pairs than in clusters . in this study",
    "we verified that 6 galaxies show deviations from their elliptical isophotes or inner substructures ; the most interesting results were obtained for 2 s0 galaxies .",
    "one of them , cpg577b , shows inner shells and the other one , cpg583a , exhibits x - structures .",
    "however , because of the small size of our sample we are unable to draw any conclusion on the enviromental origin of these features .",
    "however , our results agree with previous ones and show that x - structures is one of the less frequently observed forms of fine structure ( less than 10% of our sample show this structure ) .    it is well known that interaction can trigger both thermal and non - thermal activity , i.e. starburst and agn ( dahari 1985 , gallimore & keel 1993 , keel and van soest 1992 , liu & kennicutt 1995 ) .",
    "however , while many active galaxies show signs of interactions , not all interacting galaxies show signs of activity . an intuitive solution for this dichotomy",
    "is the fact that tidal damage is long - lived ( few gyr ) while any form of activity is short lived ( 10@xmath31 yr ) .",
    "keel et al .",
    "( 1985 ) showed that seyfert activity is over - represented in early stage interactions .",
    "liu & kennicutt ( 1995 ) work on merging systems found a very large range of spectral properties , ranging from completely evolved stellar populations to starburst and post - starburst systems .",
    "however , samples of galaxies such as the one selected by bergvall & johansson ( 1995 ) lack of such effects ( n. bergvall private communication ) .",
    "this is may be due to the fact that bergvall & johansson s sample includes weak cases of interaction and pairs with large separations , which is particularly different from the sample that we are analyzing .",
    "some pairs of galaxies of our sample are in stages of interaction which present tidal damage and also activity .",
    "there is strong tidal damage on late - type galaxies such as cpg083 , cpg551 , cpg580 and even on early - type galaxies such as cpg099 .",
    "there is seyfert activity in cpg083 and cpg575 ( hippelein 1989 and marquez & moles 1994 ) and several star formation regions in cpg551a and cpg580b .",
    "however , one has to take into account that pairs of different morphologies may have passed to different evolution processes and therefore show different effects .",
    "moreover , activities in disturbed disks have a longer lifetime due to a larger available gas supply in a disturbed disk ( keel 1996 ) .",
    "we have selected a local sample of pairs of galaxies with the aim of building a photometric database which will be used in the future for comparing local pairs properties with more distant pairs .",
    "a few properties of local pairs that we have discussed in this paper are :                moreover , one should take into account that local pairs of different morphology may have passed to a different evolution process which violently transformed their morphology .",
    "pairs with at least one early - type component may be descendents of groups of galaxies , i.e. the early  type galaxy been already a result of a collapse of a group of galaxies .",
    "however , late  type pairs are probably long  lived showing clearly signs of interaction .",
    "some of them could be seen as an early stage of mergers because they are still separated but with their disks very disturbed .",
    "one has also to account for the fact that more distant pairs could be in the process of formation and would have different properties when compared to these local pairs .",
