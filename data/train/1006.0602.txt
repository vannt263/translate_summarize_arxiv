    "<S> the weaker magnetization observed for the superlattice with @xmath8=1 compared to ( lamno@xmath0)@xmath17/(srmno@xmath0)@xmath16 , is due to a decreased magnetization caused in a la@xmath18sr@xmath19mno@xmath0 solid solution by replacing the la by nd , pr or y which have smaller ionic radii @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> possible origins for sg in this system include : ( 1 ) sg characteristics present in each layer , ( 2 ) miscut between substrate and the first layer from the substrate , lamno@xmath0 , and ( 3 ) magnetic frustration between fm and af regions , where fm and af regions are possibly present at interfaces and in the core of each layer , respectively . the possibility for this behavior being due to each layer can be ruled out , however , by the systematic changes in the amplitudes and the irreversible temperatures of the magnetization for samples with different periods ( fig . </S>",

    "<S> magnetization curves of each individual manganite show af not a sg . a possible source for </S>",
    "<S> the sg characteristics may be the interface between the substrate ( srtio@xmath0 ) and the first deposited layer of lamno@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this too , can not be the origin for our observations , since the magnetization curves as a function of temperature for a 60 unit cells lamno@xmath0 layer grown on srtio@xmath0 indicates af not a sg @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we believe a competition between the fm and af layers may account for our observations . </S>",

    "<S> the weak bragg peak at @xmath25 = 0.045 @xmath49 is due to the similarity in the nuclear scattering length for la , sr and nd atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the reflectivity measured in a magnetic field of 0.6 t applied parallel to the film s surface , after field cooling to 10k in 0.6 t , shows strong bragg peaks and significant difference between r@xmath50 and r@xmath51 , indicating the presence of a magnetic modulation in the superlattice . </S>",

    "<S> notably , there is no signature of an enhancement at interfaces of lamno@xmath0/ndmno@xmath0 . </S>",
