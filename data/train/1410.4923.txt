    "boxiness of galactic bulges is in most cases discussed in connection with the boxiness observed in the edge - on views of disc galaxies .",
    "however , boxiness is encountered also in nearly face - on views of barred galaxies .",
    "this can be either an overall boxiness of the bar , usually referring to rectangularity of the outermost isophotes of the bar component in early - type barred galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or boxiness of the isophotes in the inner regions , i.e. in distances from the centre roughly up to the middle of the semi - major axis of the bar @xcite .    as regards the outer boxiness it is plausible to assume that it is related with orbits at the end of the bar , i.e. at regions with a much smaller scale height than that of the regions of the bar that participate in the formation of the peanut",
    "in that respect , for the outer boxiness of the bar the presence of the radial 4:1 resonance brings in the system rectangular - like p.o . @xcite",
    "that attract around them quasi - periodic or sticky non - periodic orbits .",
    "the role of chaotic orbits in reinforcing the outer boxiness of the bars has been indicated by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this can lead to the boxy shapes of early type bars . in the study of the outer face - on boxiness of the bars , we deal practically with 2d dynamics .",
    "thus , we find in 2d models , that orbits associated with this feature are also related with the orbits building the chaotic spirals beyond corotation @xcite , i.e. both structures share the same orbital content .",
    "essentially these are orbits on the equatorial plane .",
    "nevertheless , the connection of the rectangularity of a bar with the radial 4:1 resonance has been also detected in 3d models @xcite .",
    "however , the relevant orbits remain at small heights away from the equatorial plane .    for the _ inner _ boxiness on the other hand we must use 3d orbits .",
    "if we accept the dimensions of a boxy bulge being as discussed in @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) , the rectangularity of the inner isophotes ( as depicted in the figures of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) corresponds to regions occupied by the b / p bulge in the side - on profiles . from this",
    "arises the question if there exist 3d orbits contributing both to a face - on as well as to a side - on boxy profile .",
    "the existence of this combination is not obvious .",
    "thinking about the shapes of periodic orbits , or about quasi - periodic orbits with similar shapes like the periodic ones , this combination does not exist neither for this model nor for any other of the models in @xcite or in the model used by @xcite .",
    "the periodic orbits of the x1-tree ( x1 , x1v1 , x1v2 , x1v3 etc . ) follow in their projections on the equatorial plane the morphological evolution of the x1 family as the jacobi constant ( hereafter called energy ) increases . we have to reach energies at the radial 4:1 resonance in order to obtain a rectangular shape in their face - on , @xmath1 in our model , projection @xcite .",
    "orbits with such energies are found in the outer parts of the bars .",
    "however , if we consider large @xmath2 or @xmath3 perturbations of planar p.o . in the 4:1 resonance region",
    ", calculating in this way orbits with large @xmath4 values , we enter into chaotic regimes of the models , where orbits do    not support any particular structure . by excluding orbits with large energies ,",
    "i.e. at or between the radial 4:1 resonance and corotation , we have to seek after orbits in lower energies , where we encounter the orbits supporting the boxiness of the edge - on profiles .",
    "stable 2d orbits of the planar , `` 3:1-type '' , families could contribute to the reinforcement of boxy structures on the equatorial plane @xcite .",
    "vertically perturbed orbits with @xmath5 initial conditions on their islands of stability are candidates for providing 3d orbits with boxy projections on the @xmath1 plane .",
    "this possibility has to be examined for representatives of these families with appropriate energies .",
    "we already have seen that there are orbits supporting the side - on b / p bulge without having a `` x1-like '' morphology in their face - on projection ( cf figure 19 in paper i ) . in the present paper",
    "we examine the possibility of having among them orbits with boxy @xmath1 projections .",
    "we use in our work the same model as in paper i and we keep the same formalism . in section",
    "[ sec : iboxi ] , starting with 2d orbits on the equatorial plane , we examine their orbital behaviour when they are perturbed away from it . focusing on the non - periodic orbits that support the b / p structure",
    "we first study their dynamics in the typical case where all important families coexist and x1 is stable .",
    "then we investigate as well possible changes introduced in the energy interval of the vertical ilr , where x1 is simple unstable . in section  [ sec:3/1 ] we investigate the role of symmetric orbits bifurcated at odd , radial n:1 resonances .",
    "finally , we summaries our results and discuss our conclusions in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "an energy at which all main families of p.o . contributing to the b / p structure coexist is e@xmath6 @xmath7 . at this energy x1 , x1v1 and x1mul2 are stable , while x1v2 is simple unstable @xcite .",
    "it is a typical energy for understanding the dynamics at the peanut region .",

    "let us call it tr1 , and further out a chain of seven stability islands ( drawn with green ) that mark the border between the ordered region and a chaotic zone that surrounds it .",
    "embedded in this chaotic zone we observe two sets of islands .",

    "[ xpx41 ] these three families of higher multiplicity seem to play a minor role in the enhancement of any morphological feature in the model .",

    "we plot the stability diagram of x1 considering it as being of multiplicity two ( fig .",
    "[ mul2stab ] ) . both rm21 and rm22 families",

    "they are bifurcated from x1 at e@xmath6 @xmath16 , where the b1 stability index of x1 , considered as being of multiplicity 2 , has a tangency with the b@xmath17 axis . the b1 stability index is associated with radial perturbations , so two 2d families of p.o .",
    "are bifurcated .",
    "they are initially simple unstable ( u ) , since the mother family x1 is u at the energy they are introduced in the system .",
    "the other family of higher multiplicity we have encountered at e@xmath6 @xmath7 is the orbit of multiplicity 3 , tr1 , which is indicated with an arrow , inside the territory of the central stability island in fig .",
    "[ xpx41 ] .",
    "it coexists together with its unstable counterpart of multiplicity 3 , which is located between the three islands of stability ( not indicated in fig .",
    "[ xpx41 ] ) .",
    "the origin of tr1 can be found by considering it as a `` deuxime genre '' family @xcite .",
    "since it is a radial bifurcation of x1 its starting point has to be sought at an energy where the corresponding stability index of the simple periodic mother family will be @xmath18 ( see e.g. the appendix in * ? ? ?",

    "in addition its stability secures motion on 4d tori and sticky orbits on them .",

    "orbits perturbed by @xmath26 or @xmath27 can give orbits with boxy face - on profiles , which however remain in small heights .",
    "these are orbits associated with a possible outer boxiness of the bar .",
    "as it is known ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) in rotating galactic potentials , at the radial n:1 resonances with n being an odd integer , we have a type 3 bifurcation @xcite . in that case ,",

    "that reinforce boxy morphologies close to the end of the bar if integrated for long times .",
    "however , for the inner boxiness we study here , the appropriate orbits have to support boxy features in the bar . in other words their @xmath1 projections",

    "starting from the p.o . , or from initial conditions on an invariant curve around o1/o1@xmath0 , or even from a @xmath10 point belonging to a sticky zone , we find sticky orbits when exceeding a critical @xmath2 or @xmath3 perturbation .",

    "non - periodic orbits associated with the o1/o1@xmath0 family fail to provide clear boxy features in their face - on views like the orbits in figs .",
    "[ ob41 ] ,  [ bb41stick ] and  [ borbits ] . by comparing the phase space in the case of the latter orbits with that of the orbits in fig .",
    "[ ot1fig ] , we observe that the main difference is the lack of the rotational tori around x1v1 and x1v1@xmath0 . when o1 is introduced in the system x1v1 and x1v1@xmath0",
    "are already complex unstable .",
    "this indicates that the main dynamical phenomenon for having boxiness in the middle of the bar is stickiness to these tori .",
    "in other models in which 3:1 type families exist at the energies we have stable x1v1 and x1v1@xmath0 orbits they may play a role similar to that of rm2 and tr1 in figs .",
    "[ xpx41 ] and  [ ob41 ] .",
    "summarizing we can say that as long as a non - periodic orbit in the radial and vertical ilr region of our model is trapped by , or becomes sticky to , x1v1 and/or x1v1@xmath0 tori , it may visit a region of phase space , where the orbits have rectangular - like face - on @xmath1 projections .",
    "rectangularity in the morphology of non - periodic orbits is evidently related with the presence of 2d families of p.o . with boxy shapes in the equatorial plane .",
    "the presence of families like rm21 , rm22 and tr1 in @xmath10 cross sections indicate the prevalence of boxy shapes in large regions of the phase space over a large energy interval .",
    "inner boxiness is generated by perturbing initial conditions of planar orbits at energies where we find orbits with rectangular shapes on the equatorial plane and x1v1/x1v1@xmath0 tori in the phase space . as a result",
    "the orbits participating in the inner boxiness have a double boxy character ( face - on and edge - on )",
    ". among them those that reach larger heights above the equatorial plane tend to become more square .",
    "boxy periodic orbits of higher multiplicity facilitate the prevalence of boxy morphologies , because they influence larger regions of the phase space . in a typical case",
    "we have small stability islands with larger sticky zones around them .",
    "sticky chaotic orbits visit phase space regions that are far from each other .",
    "planar families of symmetric p.o",
    ". introduced at odd radial n:1 resonances do not play an important role for the inner boxiness in our model .",
    "however , they can be significant in models where they co - exist in the same energy intervals with the tori of x1v1 and x1v1@xmath0 .    in fig .",
    "[ x1etot ] we put together representative non - periodic orbits that support double boxy profiles , both from the 2:1 resonance region as well as from regions of higher resonances .",
    "the outermost , thicker drawn , black orbit , discernible in figs .",
    "[ x1etot]a and b , is a x1v6 orbit that we identify with the longest bar - supporting p.o . and",
    "is used as a measure of the length of the bar in our model . the longest boxy orbit in fig .",
    "[ x1etot]a , drawn with magenta colour is at e@xmath6 @xmath81 . in fig .",
    "[ x1etot]b , which is an almost side - on view of the same set of orbits , we can see the same magenta coloured orbit remaining in much lower heights than the orbits that build the peanut .",
    "its detailed shape , hidden by the other orbits in the central regions of the model , points to an association with x1v3 . by converting fig .",
    "[ x1etot]a to an image and by applying a smoothing filter , we obtain fig .  [ x1etot]c .",
    "we can observe how inner and outer boxiness can be formed in our model by means of quasi - periodic and sticky orbits .",
    "it has to be underlined that orbits at higher energies participating in the formation of the `` x - feature '' in the side - on views , especially by means of orbits associated with the x1v1 and x1v1@xmath82 families , contribute in general less to the surface density of the central parts of the face - on views of the bars and more to their periphery , as long as they retain a clear loop character .",
    "the closer the `` x '' supporting non - periodic orbits remain trapped around the x1v1 and x1v1@xmath82 periodic orbits , the larger is the `` transparency '' towards the face - on rectangular - like periodic orbits at lower energies with smaller heights above the equatorial plane .",
    "this becomes evident in fig .",
    "[ trans ] by means of a set of quasi - periodic orbits with e@xmath6 @xmath83 .",
    "two are trapped around x1v1 and x1v1@xmath82 ( coloured red ) , while the other two ( coloured black ) have boxy face - on projections and are from the @xmath55e@xmath56 energy interval . in ( a )      in @xcite",
    "it is presented a list with 30 galaxies ( see their a1 , a2 figures ) with boxy isophotes in the middle of the bar .",
    "these are moderately inclined galaxies , far from edge - on .",
    "since the bar of our model does not contain asymmetric terms , it is aligned with the major axis of the system .",
    "so the extent and the proportions of the inner and outer boxiness in the face - on views of the bar can be compared with rather symmetric galactic bars , in galaxies with inclinations @xmath8450@xmath85like the one of ngc  4037 or ngc  4123 ( see figures with isophotes in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      1 .",
    "the _ inner _ boxy isophotes in the middle of the bars in nearly face - on views of barred galaxies can be supported by 3d quasi - periodic and mainly by 3d chaotic orbits sticky to x1v1 and x1v1@xmath82 p.o . in the ilr region .",
    "inner boxiness is also characterized by the presence of planar periodic orbits with boxy morphology at the appropriate energies . by perturbing vertically such p.o .",
    "we generate a class of non - periodic orbits with double boxy character .",
    "the maximum distance along the bar s major axis reached by these orbits is at or inside the limmits of the b / p bulge .",

    "2 .   at large energies , orbits that reinforce `` x - features '' in the side - on views of b / p bulges by staying close to the periodic orbit ,",
    "enhance locally boxy face - on features without obscuring the sight towards boxy structures formed at lower heights .",
    "the latter are located closer to the centre of the galaxies in the @xmath1 projections .",
