    "due to recent theoretical developments and accurate astronomical data , cosmology presents explosive activity which allows to use astrophysics to perform tests of fundamental theories , otherwise inaccessible to terrestrial accelerators .",
    "the universe evolution during its different periods leads to considering at some stage in the early universe an inflationary phase that is one of the most compelling solution to many long - standing problems of the standard hot big bang scenario , for example , the flatness , the horizon , and the monopole problems , among others @xcite,@xcite . besides",
    ", the inflation era has provided a causal interpretation of the origin of the observed anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , and also the distribution of large scale structures @xcite,@xcite .    in higher dimensional cosmologies , implications of string / m - theory to friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) models in particular those related to brane cosmological models",
    "have recently attracted great deal of attention @xcite . in these models the standard model of particle is confined to the brane , while gravitations propagate in the bulk spacetimes .",
    "the effect of the extra dimension induces additional terms in the friedmann equation in the brane @xcite-@xcite .",
    "specially , a quadratic term in the energy density generally makes it easier to obtain inflation in the early universe @xcite-@xcite .    among inflationary models",
    "the particular model of intermediate inflation is of special interest . in this model expansion of",
    "the universe is slower than standard de sitter inflation @xmath0 , still faster than power law inflation @xmath1 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the model which was originally introduced as an exact inflationary solution for a particular scalar field potential , then become the slow - roll solution to potentials which are asymptotically of inverse power - law type , @xmath2 commonly used in quintessence models @xcite-@xcite .",
    "nothing that with this type of potential inflation is everlasting and a mechanism has to be introduced to bring inflation to an end @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the string theory which is the motivation behind intermediate inflationary model @xcite suggest that in order to have a ghost - free action high order curvature invariant corrections to the einstein - hilbert action must be proportional to the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the gb term as the inverse string tension , arise naturally as the leading order of the expansion to the low - energy string effective action @xcite,@xcite .",
    "these theories can be applied to solve the universe initial singularity , and explain the late time universe acceleration , among others @xcite-@xcite . in particular , in four dimension , for a dark energy model , the coupling of a dynamical dilatonic scalar field with gb term leads to the intermediate form of the solutions for scale factor , where the universe starts evolving with a decelerated exponential expansion , for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 as a constant @xcite .",
    "thus , the idea that intermediate inflation comes from an effective theory at low dimension of a more fundamental string theory is in itself very attractive .",
    "generally we assume an inflationary phase driven by the potential or vacuum energy of a scalar field , the inflaton , where its dynamics is determined by the klein - gordon action . however , there are other non - standard scalar field actions have been used in cosmology . in particular , in k - inflation",
    "@xcite higher - order scalar kinetic terms in the action can , without the help of the potential , drive an inflationary evolution .",
    "the tachyon inflation is a specific model of k - inflation for the scalar field @xmath7 , with a positive potential @xmath8 , a maximum at @xmath9 and minima as @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "the cosmological application of the gravity - tachyon models , including slow - roll inflation have been investigated by many authors @xcite-@xcite .",
    "infact , many potentials with the above properties can drive inflation , which typically takes place at a scale characterized by the brane tension , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 . in addition",
    ", the rolling tachyon can contribute to the energy density of the universe with dust - like equation of state @xcite,@xcite .",
    "thus , the tachyon may at the same time drive inflation and later behave as dark matter .",
    "so far , with the presence of tachyon field , intermediate inflation in standard gravity has been studied by the authors in @xcite . separately ,",
    "also the standard scalar field in intermediate inflation both in standard gravity and brane cosmology has been investigated in @xcite,@xcite . in this paper",
    "an intermediate inflationary universe model driven by a tachyon scalar field in a brane world effective theory will be presented .",
    "the motivation for studying the tachyon inflation in the brane world scenario has the interesting feature that the inflaton potential comes from higher dimensional gravity , or more generally , from bulk modes or string theory @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "the next section presents a short review of the tachyonic - brane - intermediate inflationary phase . in section iii",
    "we study the scalar and tensor perturbations in our model and derive the cosmological parameters . with the recent observational data from wmap we also constraint the parameters .",
    "finally , in section iv we present a conclusion .",

    "the brane tension @xmath20 relates the four and five - dimensional planck masses via the expression @xmath21 .    in the following",
    "we assume the high energy regime where @xmath22 .",
    "also we will take that the four dimensional cosmological constant to be vanished and once inflation begins , the last term will rapidly become unimportant , leaving us with the effective equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "we also assume that the scalar field is confined to the brane , so that its field equation has the standard form @xmath25 where the dot means derivatives with respect to the cosmological time . for a tachyonic scalar field , @xmath26the energy density and the pressure",
    "are respectively given by @xmath27 where @xmath8 is the tachyonic scalar potential . from eqs .",

    "the energy density for the tachyon field in the inflation era is of the order of the potential , i.e. @xmath37 . with slow - roll conditions , i.e. @xmath38 and @xmath39 , eqs .",
    "( [ highfried ] ) and ( [ eomtachyon ] ) reduce to @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "in addition , the scalar field potential , @xmath8 becomes @xmath42 where @xmath43 note that this kind of potential does not present a minimum and thus is appropriate for investigation of reheating of the universe in a nonstandard way .",
    "the dimensionless slow - roll parameters , in terms of the model parameters can be written as @xmath44 @xmath45 the number of e - folds between two different values @xmath46 and @xmath47 can also be expressed as    @xmath48    from the form of the potential and with regards to the conditions for the inflation to occur , we can find @xmath49 , at the beginning of inflation @xmath50 when @xmath51 .",

    ", we arrive at the relation : @xmath67 or equivalently , @xmath68 in terms of the model parameters which eq .",

    "the above results are similar to that obtained in @xcite for a brane intermediate inflationary model with a standard scalar field .",

    "we get that the running of the scalar spectral index becomes @xmath78 where as already mentioned , primes denote differentiation with respect to @xmath7 . in models with only scalar fluctuations the marginalized value for the derivative of the spectral index is approximately -0.034 from wmap - seven year data only @xcite .    from ( [ nsphi ] ) and ( [ nrun ] ) we can write down a relation between spectral index and its running @xmath79 on the other hand , the generation of tensor perturbations during inflation would produce gravitational waves .",
    "these perturbations in cosmology are more involved in our case , since in brane - world gravitons propagate in the bulk .",

    "interestingly , it can be shown that even in a brane intermediate inflationary scenario we get the same expression . in a similar manner",
    "we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ rns ] ) , with attention to expressions ( [ alpha ] ) and ( [ gamma ] ) as @xmath87^{(1 - 2f)/f}f^2(n_s).\\ ] ] this equation has exactly the form obtained in @xcite .",
    "therefore , on the basic of the brane intermediate inflation , the trajectories in the @xmath88 plane between standard field and tachyon field can not be distinguished at lowest order .",
    "however , maybe tachyon inflation leads to a deviation at second order in the consistency relations , like what has investigated in @xcite for a standard model .    from the potential obtained in ( [ potentialred ] )",
    "we can assume that the tachyon is rolling from the top of the potential , i.e. @xmath89 for small @xmath7 .",
