    "we thus obtain = s , which is exactly the gravitationally induced phase difference predicted for the cow experience @xcite .",
    "it is important to remark that , in the above calculation , we have used the weak equivalence principle , according to which the gravitational ( @xmath55 ) and the inertial ( @xmath56 ) masses are assumed to be equal .",
    "if they were supposed to be different , the phase shift would be given by = s .",
    "as a second application we use the phase factor ( [ npf ] ) to study the gravitational analog of the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite .",
    "the usual ( electromagnetic ) aharonov - bohm effect consists in a shift , by a constant amount , of the electron interferometry wave pattern , in a region where there is no magnetic field , but there is a nontrivial gauge potential @xmath57 .",

    "this shows that @xmath78 coincides with the axial torsion , which in turn represents the gravitomagnetic component of the gravitational field @xcite .",
    "expression ( [ gabe ] ) gives the phase difference produced by the interaction of the particle s kinetic energy with a gauge potential , which gives rise to the gravitational aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "as this phase difference depends on the energy , it applies equally to massive and massless particles .",
    "it is worthy mentioning that , for the case of massive particles , if the inertial and gravitational masses were supposed to be different , the phase shift would assume the form = .",
    "it is also worthy mentioning that , whereas for massive particles it is a genuine quantum effect , for massless particles , due to the their intrinsic wave character , it can be considered as a classical effect .",
    "in fact , for @xmath79 , eq .  ( [ gabe ] ) becomes = , [ gabeb ] and we see that , in this case , the phase difference does not depend on the planck s constant .",
    "in contrast with the electromagnetic aharonov - bohm effect , the phase difference in the gravitational case depends on the particle kinetic energy , which in turn depends on the particle s mass and velocity . like the electromagnetic case , however , the phase difference is independent of the position @xmath66 on the screen , and consequently the wave pattern defined by ( [ wpat ] ) will be whole shifted by a constant amount .",
    "it is also important to mention that the requirement of invariance of the gravitational phase factor under the translational gauge transformation ( [ btrans ] ) implies that = n h c , with @xmath80 an integer number . differently from the electromagnetic case , where it is possible to define a _",
    "quantum _ of magnetic flux , we see from the above equation that in the gravitational case it is not possible to define a particle - independent _ quantum _ of gravitomagnetic flux @xcite .",
    "we proceed now to show that , in the classical limit , the nonintegrable phase factor approach reduces to the usual approach provided by the gravitational lorentz force equation . in electromagnetism ,",
    "the standard argument is well - known : the phase turning up in the quantum case is exactly the classical action , which leads to the lorentz force .",
    "we intend , however , to illustrate the result directly , and for that we consider again the electron interferometry slit experiment , this time with a homogeneous static gravitomagnetic field @xmath74 permeating the whole region between the slit and the screen ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this field is supposed to point in the negative @xmath81-direction , and will produce a phase shift which is to be added to the phase ( [ wpat ] ) extant in the absence of gravitomagnetic field .",
    "this shift , according to eq .",
    "( [ gabe ] ) , is given by @xmath82 , with @xmath83 the flux through the surface @xmath84 circumscribed by the two trajectories .",

    "this is the result yielded by the phase - factor approach .    in the classical limit",
    ", the slit experiment can be interpreted in the following way .",
    "the electrons traveling through the gravitomagnetic field have their movement direction changed .",

    ", we can approximately write the electrons velocity as @xmath88 . in this case",

    "this transversal @xmath66-acceleration is given by a_x = .",
    "since the attained acceleration is constant , we can choose a specific point to calculate it .",
    "let us then consider the point of maximum intensity on the screen , which is determined by the condition @xmath89 .",
    "this yields x = . [ ex ] the acceleration is then found to be a_x = . from the classical point of view , therefore , we can say that the electrons experience a force in the @xmath66-direction given by _",
    "x m a_x = , with @xmath90 the electron momentum .",
    "using now the de broglie relation @xmath60 , it is possible to eliminate the planck constant .",
    "we then get the classical result _ x = v_z h_y = ( ) _ x , which gives rise to the equation of motion = ( ) _ x , where @xmath91 represents a time covariant derivative in the weitzenbck connection .",
    "this is exactly the @xmath66-component of the gravitational lorentz force equation ( [ eqmot2 ] ) ( see appendix a ) . from this equation",
    "we see clearly that , when the inertial and gravitational masses coincide , the resulting trajectory does not depend on the mass of the particle , which is in accordance with the universality property of the gravitational interaction .",
    "it is important to remark that , even if the inertial and gravitational masses are not supposed to coincide , the teleparallel approach still yields a consistent description of the gravitational interaction @xcite",
    "teleparallel gravity is a gauge theory for the translation group .",
    "its fundamental field is , accordingly , a gauge potential @xmath2 with values in the lie algebra of the translation group . in this formulation",
    ", gravitation becomes quite analogous to electromagnetism .",
    "based on that analogy and relying on the phase - factor approach to maxwell s theory , a teleparallel nonintegrable phase - factor approach to gravitation has been developed , which represents the quantum mechanical version of the classical gravitational lorentz force .    as a first application we have considered the cow experiment . by taking the newtonian limit , we have shown that the formalism yields the correct quantum phase - shift induced on the neutrons by their interaction with earth s gravitational field . as this phase shift",
    "is produced by the coupling of the neutron mass with the component @xmath92 of the translational gauge potential , it can be considered as a gravitoelectric aharonov - bohm effect @xcite . as a second application",
    "we have obtained the quantum phase - shift produced by the coupling of the particle s kinetic energy with the components @xmath93 of the gauge potential , which corresponds to the usual ( gravitomagnetic ) analog of the aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "finally , by considering a simple slit experiment in which the particles are allowed to pass through a region with a homogeneous gravitomagnetic field , we have shown that , in the classical limit , the ( quantum ) nonintegrable phase - factor approach coincides with the usual ( classical ) approach based on the gravitational lorentz force equation .",
    "this means that , as far as only classical trajectories are concerned , both approaches give the same result .",
    "in addition , provided the gravitational and inertial masses are supposed to be equal , gravitation becomes universal in the classical limit in the sense that the resulting trajectories do not depend on the masses of the particles .    at the quantum level , however , there are deep conceptual changes with respect to classical gravity .",
    "the phase of the particle wavefunction acquires a fundamental status and depends on the particle mass ( cow effect , obtained in the non - relativistic limit ) or relativistic kinetic energy ( gravitational aharonov - bohm effect ) . at the quantum level , therefore , gravitation is no more universal @xcite , although in the specific case of the non - relativistic cow experiment , by introducing a kind of quantum equivalence principle , it can be made independent of the mass when written in an appropriate way @xcite .",
    "concerning this point , it should be remarked that , since teleparallel gravity is able to describe gravitation independently of the validity or not of the equivalence principle @xcite , it will not require a quantum version of this principle to deal with gravitationally induced quantum effects .",
    "we can thus conclude that teleparallel gravity seems to provide a much more appropriate and consistent approach to study these effects .",

    "consequently , the above force equation reduces to = t_0 i j u^0 u^j . using the relations @xmath95 and @xmath96 , as well as the fact that the gravitomagnetic field does not change the absolute value of the particle velocity , and consequently @xmath97 , we obtain = c t_0 i j v^j . now , from eq .",
