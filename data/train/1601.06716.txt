    "chiral shapes are those not superimposable upon their mirror image .",
    "chirality is common in nature , e.g. , in biomolecules that exist in either left- or right - handed forms ( known as enantiomers ) .",
    "it is also seen in knotted and twisted fields , such as fluid vortices @xcite , magnetic flux tubes @xcite , and circularly polarized light @xcite . indeed , chiral electromagnetic fields have long been exploited to characterize chiral matter .",
    "more recently , their use has also been proposed for enantioselective biosensing @xcite , enantioselective separation @xcite , asymmetric catalysis @xcite , and nonlinear spectroscopic imaging @xcite . in many of these applications ,",
    "metallic nanostructures are utilized because their local plasmonic resonances can create concentrated electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "when the nanostructures have a chiral shape , they can exhibit a high degree of optical activity @xcite and induce intense highly twisted chiral near fields @xcite .    however , it is not always clear how to utilize these near fields most effectively .",
    "for example , in enantioselective biosensing , a molecule should interact with the near field of the chiral plasmonic nanostructure @xcite . to maximize the effect , the near field",
    "should first be characterized through an appropriate far - field quantity .",
    "typically , this has been done with circular dichroism ( cd ) spectroscopy , which records the difference in the optical extinction from a chiral object when it is illuminated with left- and right - handed circularly polarized light ( for alternative methods see @xcite ) . for most biomolecules , the differential absorption dominates the cd signal and provides information about the chiral arrangement of the molecular components . for larger objects ,",
    "differential scattering becomes increasingly important , yielding data about longer - range ( @xmath0 20 nm ) structure @xcite .",
    "while obtaining such knowledge is useful in many contexts , in applications such as enantioselective biosensing , we already know the nominal chiral shape of our plasmonic nanostructures . rather , we wish to characterize the chirality of their intense near fields .",
    "this can be problematic with cd spectroscopy for two reasons : ( i ) excitation with circularly polarized light introduces local chirality in the system that is unrelated to the structure , and ( ii ) the differential extinction of left- and right - handed circularly polarized light can contain unwanted cancellation effects .",
    "consequently , the amplitude and sign of the peaks in cd spectra do not directly relate to the chirality of the near field @xcite .",
    "thus , a need exists for a more useful physical quantity for characterizing chiral near fields .",
    "herein , we identify such a quantity , the optical chirality flux . by analogy with poynting s theorem , we formulate a time - averaged conservation law for chirality in lossy dispersive media .",
    "we show how a chiral nanostructure can selectively dissipate linearly polarized light and generate an optical chirality flux in the far field .",
    "further , we verify both analytically and numerically that this quantity can then provide useful information , not obtainable from cd spectroscopy , about the amplitude and handedness of the near - field chirality of the nanostructure . therefore , the optical chirality flux provides a useful far - field observable for studying chiral near fields .",
