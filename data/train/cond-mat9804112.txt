    "what is the microscopic origin of ferromagnetism ?",
    "exactly seventy years ago , in 1928 , heisenberg addressed this question  @xcite after having discovered the phenomenon of quantum mechanical exchange and the corresponding exchange interaction .",
    "he formulated a spin model ( the heisenberg model ) , hoping to be able to answer precisely this question .",
    "however , it was pointed out by bloch  @xcite that a model of localized spins can not explain _ metallic _ ferromagnetism as observed in iron , cobalt , and nickel , and that a proper model would have to include the itineracy of the electrons , i.e. the band aspect . based on the observation that the curie temperature @xmath5  ev in these systems it is clear that the kinetic energy and the spin-_in_dependent coulomb interaction , together with the pauli principle , must ultimately be responsible for metallic ferromagnetism .",
    "ever since one has been looking for the simplest microscopic model and mechanism explaining the origin of metallic ferromagnetism and , equally important , for analytic solutions or at least controlled approximations for these models  @xcite .",
    "today we know that even with the  right \" model these answers are not easily obtained since metallic ferromagnetism generally occurs only at _ intermediate _ to _ strong _ coupling and off half filling  @xcite .",
    "thus , it belongs to the class of problems for which systematic theoretical approaches do not exist .",
    "namely , weak - coupling theories or renormalization group approaches  @xcite which are so effective in detecting instabilities with respect to antiferromagnetism or superconductivity , do not work in this case . instead , _ nonperturbative",
    "_ methods are required .    during the last two or three years",
    "significant progress was made in our understanding of the microscopic foundations of metallic ferromagnetism .",
    "these insights were made possible by both new analytic methods and new numerical techniques . in this paper some of these recent developments will be reviewed .",
    "in particular , the microscopic conditions for metallic ferromagnetism in the one - band hubbard model ( section [ sec : oneband ] ) and in the case of orbital degeneracy ( section [ sec : zweiband ] ) are explained and the differences discussed .",
    "a conclusion ( section [ sec : concl ] ) closes the presentation .",
    "the simplest lattice model for correlated electrons , the one - band hubbard model @xmath6 was proposed independently by gutzwiller  @xcite , hubbard  @xcite , and kanamori  @xcite in 1963 , with the explanation of metallic ferromagnetism in 3d transition metals in mind . concerning the suitability of ( [ eqn : hub ] ) to describe metallic ferromagnetism for general @xmath3 and electron densities @xmath4",
    "the three authors came to different conclusions . in any case",
    ", the theoretical methods used at that time were not controlled enough to provide definitive conclusions .",
    "this is also true for most of the research following their original work , with a few exceptions such as nagaoka s theorem for a single hole at @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "we note that in the past the kinetic energy in ( [ eqn : hub ] ) was usually restricted to nearest - neighbor ( nn ) hopping ; then it is useful to divide the underlying lattices into bipartite and nonbipartite ones .",
    "about ten years ago the interest in the subject started to rise again  @xcite .",
    "in particular , by reducing kanamori s  @xcite model density of states ( dos ) of noninteracting electrons , @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kirchen]a ) , to its barest minimum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kirchen]b ) mielke  @xcite began to investigate the stability of ferromagnetism in systems with flat , i.e. dispersionless , bands .",
    "he  @xcite and tasaki  @xcite were able to derive rigorous criteria for the existence of ferromagnetism in these particular systems  @xcite .",
    "generalizations to nearly - flat bands are also possible  @xcite .",
    "ferromagnetism is proven to exist when the lowest band is half - filled and the system is insulating , as well as close to half filling . due to the pathological degeneracy of the ground state it is still not exactly clear whether away from half filling one really obtains _ metallic _ ferromagnetism ( for a detailed discussion see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "= 0.8    a different route to ferromagnetism was taken by mller - hartmann  @xcite who investigated the @xmath9-@xmath10 hubbard model @xmath11 i.e.  model ( [ eqn : hub ] ) with nn and next - nearest neighbor ( nnn ) hopping .",
    "he found that in @xmath12 at @xmath7 ferromagnetism becomes possible in the low - density limit ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "this scenario was extended by pieri et al .",

    "@xcite who introduced a generalized model which can be shown to have a metallic phase in @xmath12 .    in the hubbard model",
    "the interaction term is completely independent of lattice and dimension",
    ". therefore the kinetic energy , or dispersion , of the electrons and the underlying lattice must play an important role for the stability of metallic ferromagnetism .",

    "the @xmath10-hopping term destroys the antiferromagnetic nesting instability at small @xmath3  @xcite . in @xmath17",
    "it shifts spectral weight to the band edges and thereby introduces an asymmetry into the otherwise symmetric dos .",
    "it will be shown below that a high spectral weight at the band edge ( more precisely : the _ lower _ band edge for @xmath18 ) minimizes the loss of kinetic energy of the overturned spins in the magnetic state and is hence energetically favorable .",
    "therefore frustrated , i.e.  nonbipartite lattices , or bipartite lattices with frustration due to hopping ( e.g.  @xmath19 ) support the stabilization of metallic ferromagnetism .",

    "[ fig : kinerg]a , b. fig .",
    "[ fig : kinerg]a describes the paramagnetic state .",
    "the fully polarized state is obtained by inverting the spin of the down electrons , which due to the pauli principle have to occupy higher energy states .",
    "counting the energy from the lower band edge the fermi energy of the polarized state , @xmath22 , is seen to be twice that of the unpolarized state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kinerg]b ) .",
    "this should be contrasted with the dos having large spectral weight at the lower band edge shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : kinerg]c and [ fig : kinerg]d . here",
    "the fermi level of the polarized state is not so strongly shifted upwards , i.e.  fewer high energy states are populated , which is clearly energetically favorable .",
    "the energy difference between the fully polarized state and the unpolarized state    =    @xmath23      \\;de \\;n^0(e)\\ ; e\\ ] ]    must become negative for the ferromagnetic state to be stable .",
    "of course , in the noninteracting case @xmath24  @xcite . nevertheless , even for @xmath21 , @xmath25 attains its lowest value for a dos with peaked spectral weight at the lower band edge for all @xmath4  @xcite . to show that @xmath26 for @xmath27 requires a good estimate of the energy of the _ correlated paramagnet",
    " this is indeed a central problem of any correlation theory .",
    "it should be noted that the above discussion concerning the shape of the dos goes beyond the well - known stoner criterion which predicts an instability of the paramagnet for @xmath3 equal to the inverse of the dos precisely _ at _ the fermi level .",
    "another possibility to stabilize ferromagnetism is to consider those interactions which are neglected in the hubbard interaction , in particular the nn direct - exchange interaction .",
    "the effect of this and other terms will be discussed in section [ sec : nninteractions ] .      since metallic ferromagnetism is an intermediate coupling problem purely analytic approaches meet only with limited success , in particular in dimensions @xmath29 .",
    "in this situation the development of new numerical techniques in the last few years was of crucial importance for progress in this field .",
    "in particular , the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) , applicable mostly in @xmath12 , the projector quantum monte carlo method , and the dynamic mean - field theory ( dmft ) , i.e. the large @xmath30 limit , in connection with quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) have led to explicit , reliable results in dimensions @xmath31 .",

    "it clearly shows that the sign of @xmath10 is crucial : only for @xmath34 does one obtain a ferromagnetic exchange ; this seems to hold even in the extended system .",
    "of course , @xmath12 is a special dimension , since ( i ) ferromagnetic order is only possible at @xmath35 and @xmath36  @xcite , and ( ii ) the dos is always large at the band edges .",

    "even at small @xmath37 a large ferromagnetic region in the @xmath3 vs. @xmath4 phase diagram is found to exist . as @xmath38 increases the region of stability shrinks",
    "this is due to the fact that for @xmath39 the zig - zag chain separates into two unconnected chains with @xmath10 as pure nn hopping ; in this case the lieb - mattis theorem  @xcite rules out a ferromagnetic state .",
    "@xmath40 : the @xmath9-@xmath10 hubbard model on a square lattice was investigated by hlubina et al .  @xcite . at @xmath35 , using projector qmc on systems as large as 20 x 20 sites and working at specific  van hove densities \" for which the fermi energy coincides with the divergence in the noninteracting dos , these authors found a region of metallic ferromagnetism , e.g. at @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 : already in three dimensions the coordination number of a fcc lattice is @xmath43 . it is therefore quite natural to view @xmath44 as a large number , and to consider the limit @xmath45  @xcite . in this case one has to scale the hopping , e.g. as @xmath46 ( in the following @xmath47 ) , and thus obtains a purely local theory where the self energy becomes @xmath48 independent and where the propagator @xmath49 may be represented by the noninteracting propagator at a shifted frequency  @xcite . in this limit the dynamics of the quantum mechanical correlation problem is fully included , but due to the local nature of the theory there is no _ short_-range order in position space .",
    "the dependence on the lattice or the dispersion is then encoded in the dos @xmath8 of the noninteracting particles . in view of these properties",
    "the @xmath50 limit is now generally referred to as `` dynamical mean - field theory '' ( dmft )  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : fccdos ] . for @xmath53",
    "no instability is found at temperatures accessible to qmc .",
    "however , already a small contribution of @xmath10-hopping ( which is present in any real system ) is enough to produce a large region of stability for metallic ferromagnetism in addition to an antiferromagnetic phase close to half filling ( fig .",

    "hence , @xmath79 ( and also the other neglected interactions ) may well be important for systems on the verge of a ferromagnetic instability . nevertheless , since we now know that the hubbard interaction @xmath3 together with a suitable kinetic energy is sufficient to trigger a ferromagnetic instability the ferromagnetic exchange interaction does not , in general , play an unrenounceable role and is thus less important than @xmath3 itself .",
    "the properties of the metallic ferromagnets iron , cobalt , and nickel are determined by 3d electrons , implying a five - fold degeneracy .",

    "slater  @xcite and van vleck  @xcite suggested that this `` atomic magnetism '' may be transmitted from one atom to another by the kinetic energy , leading to coherent bulk order in the system .",
    "the relevant hamiltonian is then a sum of hubbard models for each orbital , complemented by the purely local interband coupling terms in ( [ eqn : interband ] ) :    = 0.3    @xmath83 + v_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize interband}}.\\ ] ]    this model has received wide attention  @xcite , especially most recently  @xcite . away from quarter or half",

    "a stabilization of this phase at intermediate @xmath3 values requires a sufficiently large spectral weight near the band edge .",
    "such a dos is typical for frustrated lattices which optimize the kinetic energy of the polarized state and at the same time frustrate the parasitic antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "by contrast , the origin of metallic ferromagnetism in the band - degenerate hubbard model need not primarily be due to a dos effect but is rather caused by ( moderate ) hund s rule couplings . in this respect the origin of ferromagnetism in the orbitally degenerate model is more straightforward than in the one - band case . in the absence of orbital ordering the resulting magnetic phase diagrams are remarkably similar .",
    "the identification of a single main driving force for the stabilization of metallic ferromagnetism in the one - band and the band - degenerate model , respectively , helps to differentiate between different effects . in real systems",
    "these effects will tend to conspire , as is evident , for example , in nickel where an fcc lattice leads to a strongly asymmetric dos and the band degeneracy provides for hund s rule couplings .",
