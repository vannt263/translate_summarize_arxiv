    "scattering , absorption , and reradiation of photons by dust grains affect the propagation of starlight and play a key role in regulating the energy balance in the interstellar medium .",
    "studies of these processes have provided a great deal of insight into the physical and chemical properties of dust grains ( for reviews of dust properties , see mathis 1990a ; witt 2003 ) .",
    "it is also important to disentangle the effects of intervening dust from many kinds of astronomical observations , ranging from photometry and spectroscopy of galactic stars and external galaxies to mapping small - scale anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) .",
    "the degree of absorption and scattering by dust depends , in general , on the wavelength of the incident radiation ( whitford 1958 ) .",
    "this dependence can be quantified in terms of the normalized dust extinction law @xmath20 ( or reddening law ) , where extinction is the sum of absorption plus scattering .",
    "the ratio of total to selective extinction , @xmath21 , is a commonly - used measure of the slope of the extinction / reddening law . using data along many different galactic sight - lines , cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 , hereafter ccm ) found a tight correlation between the overall shape of the reddening law and the slope @xmath0 .",
    "ccm devised an @xmath0-based , one - parameter family of empirical fitting functions to characterize the observed range of extinction law shapes ; this parameterization was later refined by fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) .",
    "galactic dust displays a wide range of behavior . while diffuse interstellar dust is observed to have @xmath22 _ on average _",
    "( savage & mathis 1979 ; ccm ) , this value is by no means universal",
    ". significant deviations from this canonical @xmath22 value ( and corresponding differences in the overall shape of the extinction / reddening law ) are known to exist for a variety of interstellar dust clouds , and these variations appear to be generally correlated with environment ( fitzpatrick 1999 ) .",
    "for example , @xmath0 has been found to range from 4 to 5 in dense molecular clouds ( mathis 1990b ; larson , whittet , & hough 1996 ; whittet et  al .",
    "2001 ) , whereas there are indications that more diffuse , high - latitude cirrus clouds may have @xmath0 values as small as @xmath23 ( fitzpatrick & massa 1990 ; larson et  al .  1996",
    "; szomoru & guhathakurta 1999 ) .",
    "studies based on stellar photometry from the optical gravitational lens experiment ( ogle ) and massive compact halo objects ( macho ) projects point to @xmath0 being substantially smaller than  3 in the direction of the galactic bulge ( popowski 2000 ; popowski , cook , & becker 2003 ; udalski 2003 ; sumi 2004 ; popowski 2004 ) .",
    "barbaro et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) find departures from the ccm parameterization in the ultraviolet portion of the galactic extinction law .",
    "it is worth noting that the above studies sample dust at a wide range of distances from the sun : some probe the diffuse interstellar medium in its immediate vicinity whereas others , especially those at low galactic latitudes , can probe dust at much larger distances well outside the solar neighborhood ( e.g. ,  the rcra cloud studied by szomoru & guhathakurta 1999 ) .",
    "some studies have suggested that @xmath0 variations are tied to variations in the size distribution of dust grains from one line of sight to another . in diffuse",
    "cirrus clouds , a relative abundance of small grains might explain the steep rise of the extinction curve into the ultraviolet ( ccm ; larson et  al.1996 ) .",
    "by contrast , a high abundance of large grains , which grow readily by coagulation in dense molecular clouds , may explain the larger than average values of @xmath0 observed in these regions ( whittet et  al .",
    "whittet et  al",
    ".  suggest that , in dense molecular clouds , @xmath0 remains close to the standard value of  3.1 except for lines of sight with unusually high extinction ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "this may indicate a more complicated relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , it has been argued that chemical composition can also play a role in determining the shape of the extinction law ( rhoads , malhotra , & kochanski 2004 ) .    to improve our understanding of the dependence of @xmath0 on environment ,",
    "measurements are necessary along many sight - lines through a broad range of cloud types .",
    "clusters with differential extinction / reddening have long been used to measure the @xmath0 of intervening dust ( mihalas & routly 1968 ) .",
    "the traditional method of spectral typing individual cluster stars ( e.g. ,  on the morgan - keenan system ) , in conjunction with photometric measurements , allows for a direct and precise measurement of extinction and reddening .",
    "however , this method of measuring @xmath0 requires high - quality , flux - calibrated spectra and a good understanding of the effects of metallicity on the energy output of stars .",
    "our study focuses instead on the use of broad - band photometry in light of the fact that an extensive suite of photometric data sets is currently available .    in this paper , we propose three  methods for measuring the @xmath0 of dust in the foreground of differentially - reddened globular clusters .",
    "the first two  methods are closely related to each other and rely on accurate three - band optical photometry of cluster stars .",
    "the third relies on two - band optical photometry and a map of the dust thermal emission ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 , hereafter sfd ) and is particularly well suited to wide - field data .",
    "all three  methods are based on the premise that the width of the blue horizontal branch ( hb ) is minimized when the appropriate @xmath0 value is used to correct the photometry for extinction and reddening .",
    "the methods are applied to ngc  4833 , a low - latitude galactic globular cluster with variable extinction across its face .",
    "realistic monte carlo simulations of the cluster data set are used to estimate the accuracy with which @xmath0 can be recovered .",
    "nearly two decades ago , low et  al .",
    "( 1984 ) noticed diffuse background emission in the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) 60 and 100@xmath26 m maps and termed it ` infrared cirrus ' due to its complex texture .",
    "the cirrus has been associated with thermal emission from dust grains in the diffuse interstellar medium ( beichman 1987 ) . combining the angular resolution of the iras observations with the photometric accuracy of the cosmic background explorer ( cobe)/diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) data , sfd derived all - sky maps of the dust column density and mean temperature .",
    "one of the primary uses of these maps has been to correct extragalactic sources for extinction and reddening .",
    "the sfd maps show structure in the cirrus down to the smallest angular scales resolved by iras ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "gautier et  al .",
    "( 1992 ) described the structure in the iras data in terms of its angular power spectrum , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the fourier power , @xmath30 is the reciprocal of the angular scale , and @xmath31 is the spectral index . similarly , guhathakurta & cutri ( 1994 ) examined both iras 100@xmath26 m maps and optical ccd surface photometry of reprocessed starlight from dust grains : they found that power on small scales was dominated by stars and galaxies , and since it was impossible to completely separate out these components , they merely cleared out the obvious compact `` objects '' ( stars and galaxies ) and smoothed the residual image over arcminute scales ; the resulting power spectrum had an index @xmath32 .",
    "more recently , kiss et  al .  ( 2003 ) observed 13  fields with infrared space observatory ( iso)/isophot and found that the power spectrum index varies from field to field over the range @xmath33 for angular scales larger than @xmath34 .",
    "this work extends the finding of @xmath35 by herbstmeier et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) in their earlier isophot - based study .",
    "these last two  studies indicate that @xmath36 is not universal .    in this study",
    ", the scatter in the hb of the differentially - reddened globular cluster ngc  4833 is used to measure the angular power spectrum of dust on scales smaller than the angular resolution of the thermal emission maps ( e.g. ,  iras , dirbe , isophot ) . for uncrowded data such as ours ,",
    "the smallest angular scale down to which this method can be applied is set by the surface density of hb tracers which in turn determines the typical nearest - neighbor separation ; in crowding - limited situations , the smallest angular scale is a few times the size of the stellar point spread function : few arcseconds for ground - based images and sub - arcsecond for _ hubble space telescope _",
    "images .",
    "because interstellar dust causes extinction and reddening of starlight and reprocesses the energy , dust patchiness has a profound impact on the accuracy of many astronomical measurements even at high galactic latitudes . thermal emission from cold dust",
    "can confuse cmbr anisotropy measurements .",
    "measurements of large - scale structure in galaxy surveys may be influenced by spatial non - uniformities in the foreground dust .",
    "studies of stellar populations are at risk because measurements of @xmath37 can be impacted by reddening .",
    "extinction can affect the photometry of distance indicators and thereby produce systematic errors in the distance - scale ladder .",
    "it is therefore important to quantify extinction / reddening variations on the smallest scales possible . while the sfd study does an excellent job of characterizing moderate- to large - scale dust variations , their maps miss power on scales smaller than a few  arcminutes .",

    "the main conclusions of this paper are summarized in  7 .",
    "the globular cluster ngc  4833 is located near the equatorial plane of our galaxy ( @xmath38 ) in a dusty region of the constellation musca . the cluster has a mean reddening of @xmath39  mag and reddening variations of order @xmath40  mag across the field ( melbourne et  al .",

    "a detailed description of the data set is given in that paper so only a brief discussion appears here .",
    "the ccd images of the cluster were obtained in 1996 using the 0.9-m telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory .",
    "the data reduction was carried out with the daophot  ii ( stetson 1994 ) stellar photometry package .",
    "figure  [ fig : fullcmd ] shows the ( @xmath4 ,  @xmath5 ) and ( @xmath6 ,  @xmath5 ) cmds ( left and right panels , respectively ) for the full @xmath41 field .",
    "boxes are drawn in the former cmd around the 260  objects that are considered to be candidate cluster hb stars for the purposes of this study ( possible non - hb interlopers in the sample are discussed in  4.1.1 ) .",
    "extinction / reddening variations across the field affect the width of the principal sequences of the cmds .",
    "figure  [ fig : radcmd ] shows that the hb is relatively tight and narrow for the central @xmath42 region of the cluster , but increases in width for stars distributed over a larger area in the outer region of the cluster .",
    "this suggests that extinction / reddening variations across the field , rather than photometric errors , are the cause of the large scatter in the hb ; if anything , photometric errors tend to be slightly worse in the inner region of the cluster because of crowding .",
    "a color - color diagram of cluster hb stars is plotted in the top panel of figure  [ fig : cc ] , while the bottom panel shows the same after correcting for reddening on a star - by - star basis .",
    "the @xmath43 value for each star is taken from the sfd dust map , and an assumed @xmath0 value of  3.0 is plugged into the ccm parameterization of the dust extinction law ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : cardel ] ) to derive @xmath44 and the corresponding @xmath45 value .",
    "the reddening - corrected data ( and the uncorrected data , for that matter ) show a linear relationship between @xmath4 and @xmath6 . a least - squares fit ( solid line )",
    "is made to the reddening - corrected data : @xmath46 this equation , in conjunction with the two - polynomial fiducial fit to the hb in the ( @xmath4 ,  @xmath5 ) cmd , is used to simulate @xmath1 photometry of hb stars (  3.2 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : photerr ] shows the typical @xmath47 photometric errors in the @xmath1 bands for ngc  4833 stars as a function of their apparent visual magnitude ( melbourne et  al .",
    "the photometric errors , estimated using the daophot  ii software package ( stetson 1994 ) , range from @xmath48  mag at the bright end of the hb ( @xmath49 ) to @xmath50  mag at the faint end ( @xmath51 ) , and contribute noticeably to the width of the hb .",
    "the characteristic photometric error is defined to be that at @xmath52 , @xmath53  mag , and this is what is referred to throughout the rest of this paper .",
    "a key aspect of our study is the use of simulated cluster data sets to fine tune and test the @xmath0 measurement methods (  4 ) .",
    "these simulated data sets are designed to mimic the general properties of the ngc  4833 data set as closely as possible .",
    "since we are also interested in applying these @xmath0 measurement methods to a broad range of data , the main set of simulations are constructed over a two - dimensional grid of parameter space : three _ input _ @xmath0 values and three  levels of photometric precision . at each of these 9 ( @xmath54 ) grid points ,",
    "100  monte - carlo realizations are carried out ",
    ",  a total of 900  simulated clusters are constructed each containing 260  hb stars .",
    "the rest of this section describes the step - by - step procedure used to construct each simulated data set .",
    "three  input @xmath0 values , 2.0 , 3.0 and 4.0 , are chosen for the simulated cluster data sets .",
    "these mimic a range of extinction law properties for the foreground dust and span the range of values observed in lines of sight with moderate to light reddening (  1.1 ) .",
    "the ccm parameterization of the galactic extinction laws : @xmath55 is adopted here . for a given choice of @xmath0 , the visual extinction @xmath25",
    "is translated to its corresponding @xmath43 and @xmath45 color excesses .",
    "each simulated star is assigned @xmath56- and @xmath5-band photometry via a random drawing from a fiducial hb curve in the cmd .",
    "the fiducial is based on stitching together two  second - order polynomials that are fit to the extinction / reddening - corrected ( @xmath4 ,  @xmath5 ) hb of ngc  4833 , where the @xmath43 correction for each star is obtained from the sfd dust map and @xmath0 is assumed to be  3.0 .",
    "examples of such two - polynomial fiducial hbs are shown in figures  [ fig : av_method ] and [ fig : schlegel_method ] .",
    "the `` sfd - corrected '' cluster hb used for the fiducial fit is similar to the one shown in the left - middle panel of figure  [ fig : cmd6 ] , except for the fact that the one illustrated has had the mean extinction / reddening reapplied to it .",
    "when drawing 260  stars from the fiducial , the run of stellar density along the simulated hb is made to mimic that observed along the cluster hb .",
    "this is done by dividing the fiducial into sections and demanding that the number of stars in each section match that in the corresponding section of the cluster hb .",
    "simulated @xmath57-band photometry is obtained from the linear fit to the ( @xmath4 ,  @xmath6 ) color - color diagram of cluster hb stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cc ] , eqn .",
    "[ eqn : cc ] ) .      the width of the hb can be used to quantify the effect of extinction / reddening variations .",
    "figure  [ fig : hbscat ] shows the rms scatter of hb stars in ngc  4833 as a function of their @xmath5 magnitude ( solid line ) .",
    "the rms scatter is calculated based on the _ shortest distance _ of each hb star from the fiducial curve ( i.e. ,  distance to the nearest tangent point on the curve ) .",
    "the fiducial consists of two  second - order polynomials fit to hb stars within @xmath58 of the cluster center .",
    "the dotted line in figure  [ fig : hbscat ] is a model prediction for the hb scatter that would result from photometric errors alone , the dashed line shows the effect of large - scale extinction / reddening variations from sfd plus photometric error , and the dot - dashed line the effect of small- and large - scale extinction / reddening variations plus photometric error .",
    "it is clear from the scatter at the bright end of the hb ( @xmath59 ) that only the dot - dashed line matches the ngc  4833 data .",
    "the following subsections describe in turn the simulations behind the three  model lines .      a special set of 100  photometric - error - only ( `` @xmath60-only '' ) simulations containing _ no _ reddening variations is constructed for illustration purposes only ; this set is not used in any of the @xmath0 determination exercises described in  4 .",
    "each monte carlo realization in this special set involves three  steps : ( * 1 * )  an artificial hb is constructed as described in  3.2 above ; ( * 2 * )  the mean extinction and reddening of the cluster , @xmath61 and @xmath39 ( based on @xmath62 ) , are applied to all simulated stars to bring them into the same range of apparent @xmath1 magnitudes as the ngc  4833 hb stars ; and ( * 3 * )  gaussian photometric errors are added assuming @xmath63 .",
    "the details of step  ( 3 ) are given in  3.4 below .",
    "the dotted line in figure  [ fig : hbscat ] is the scatter measured in @xmath64  simulated hb stars .",
    "the mismatch with the ngc  4833 data ( solid line ) demonstrates that photometric errors alone can not explain the width of the cluster s hb and there must be additional sources of scatter in the hb .",
    "( the dotted line is much smoother than the solid line because it is based on 100@xmath65 as many stars . )",
    "the obvious additional source of hb scatter is differential extinction / reddening across the cluster .",
    "large - scale variations based on the sfd map are explored in this section .",
    "their maps provide @xmath43 color excesses as a function of sky position , but have an angular resolution of @xmath66 and therefore contain power only on scales larger than this .",
    "the sfd map includes ngc  4833 and the region around it , and indicates that the mean reddening along this line of sight is @xmath67  mag with variations on the order of @xmath40  mag .",
    "following the procedure described above for the `` @xmath60-only '' simulations (  3.3.1 ) , another special set of 100  simulations is constructed containing only large - scale extinction / reddening variations and photometric errors .",
    "again , these special `` sfd+@xmath60 '' simulations are created for illustrative purposes alone .",
    "the only difference is in step  ( 2 ) of the procedure : instead of applying the same ( mean ) extinction and reddening values to all simulated hb stars , each star is randomly assigned the sky position of one of the 260  hb stars in ngc  4833 and the corresponding sfd @xmath43 value , and associated @xmath25 and @xmath45 values based on @xmath62 , are applied to the @xmath1 magnitudes of the simulated star . by assigning actual sky positions to the simulated hb stars ,",
    "we ensure that they mimic the spatial distribution of ngc  4833 s hb stars and range of large - scale extinction / reddening variations across the cluster data set .",
    "the dashed line in figure  [ fig : hbscat ] , based on @xmath64  simulated hb stars , shows the scatter resulting from a realistic amount of large - scale extinction / reddening variations and photometric error .",
    "even this line falls a little short of explaining the hb scatter observed in the cluster ( solid line ) .",
    "the most probable cause of this shortfall is the coarse resolution of the sfd map which averages over structure in the dust distribution on angular scales smaller than @xmath66 .",
    "small - scale variations are incorporated into the simulated data sets by adding random gaussian fluctuations with an amplitude proportional to the sfd reddening value at that location : @xmath68\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is a random number ( for the @xmath9-th star ) drawn from a gaussian distribution with zero mean and width @xmath70 .",
    "this brings us back to the main set of simulations used for testing the @xmath0 determination methods in  4 .",
    "they are constructed using a procedure similar to that used for the special set of `` sfd+@xmath60 '' simulations (  3.3.2 ) but with two changes .",
    "first , the sfd reddening values in step  ( 2 ) of the procedure are replaced by @xmath71 from eqn .",
    "[ eqn : smallscale ] above .",
    "second , a range of @xmath0 values (  3.1 ) and photometric error levels (  3.4 ) are used .    with the above choice of gaussian width for the small - scale dust variations , @xmath70 , and for @xmath63 and @xmath62 , the scatter in the simulated hb approaches that of ngc  4833 s hb ( dot - dashed vs.  solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : hbscat ] ) .",
    "this is a reasonable estimate of the amount of smoothing of dust fine - scale structure in the sfd maps (  5.1 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : powspec ] ) , and is well within the 10% uncertainty in reddening values estimated by the authors .",
    "the final step in the construction of the main set of simulated hb data sets is the inclusion of photometric error .",
    "since the photometric uncertainty is a function of stellar brightness , this step must be carried out after the inclusion of ( large- and small - scale ) dust effects so that each star is at the appropriate apparent brightness .",
    "gaussian random noise is added to the @xmath1 magnitudes of each star .",
    "three  levels of photometric error are simulated : ( 1 )  @xmath63 , with the latter being the daophot - based errors shown in figure  [ fig : photerr ] ; ( 2 )  @xmath72 ; and ( 3 )  @xmath73 .",
    "we employ three  methods for measuring @xmath0 in the direction of differentially - reddened globular clusters .",
    "each method relies on the premise that the width of the blue hb will be minimized when the appropriate @xmath0 value is used to correct for extinction and reddening .",

    ", photometric errors can not explain the correlated scatter seen in ngc  4833 s hb . moreover , as will be demonstrated in  5 , the difference in @xmath3 between pairs of hb stars scales with their angular separation in a manner consistent with the dust power spectrum measured at larger angular separations ; photometric errors have no natural way of explaining this trend either .    another factor to consider",
    "is _ intrinsic _ scatter in the hb caused by astrophysical effects such as variations in chemical abundance , age , and mass loss between cluster stars .",
    "it is possible that these can produce correlated scatter between the two  cmds and thereby mimic differential extinction / reddening .",
    "however , this scenario can not explain the scaling of the @xmath3 differences with angular separation (  5 ) .",
    "if there was a radial gradient in intrinsic stellar properties within the cluster , one might expect to see a shift of the hb sequence in the cmd between inner and outer regions .",
    "instead , figure  [ fig : radcmd ] shows no such shift ( the increased scatter in the hb in the outer cmd is best explained in terms of dust variations ; see  2.1 ) .",
    "in earlier sections , we demonstrated the effects of spatial extinction / reddening variations on the photometry of ngc  4833 .",
    "we now turn to a statistical description of the strength of these extinction / reddening variations as a function of angular scale .",
    "figure  [ fig : dustmap ] is a map of the _ relative _ visual extinction across the face of ngc  4833 .",
    "each point on the map represents the sky position of a hb star in the cluster .",
    "the size of each point is scaled by the measured strength of the relative visual extinction @xmath74 at that location ; it varies from @xmath105 to @xmath106  mag ( smallest@xmath107largest ) .",
    "as described in  4.1.1 , @xmath74 is the vertical distance between the star s cmd location and the point where the reddening vector drawn from the star intersects the fiducial hb ; the fiducial is a fit to the central region of the cluster , and therefore corresponds to a mean visual extinction of @xmath108 . in keeping with the findings of melbourne et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) , there is a clear overall n - s gradient in @xmath74 across ngc  4833 , but the extinction can vary significantly from point to point even for points relatively close to each other .",
    "these variations can be characterized in terms of the angular power spectrum of the foreground dust complex .",
    "a direct measurement of the power spectrum is difficult however because of the sparse and irregular spatial sampling of the data points .",
    "the following approach is adopted instead .",
    "first , the `` variance spectrum '' as a function of angular scale is calculated from the cluster @xmath74 data (  5.1 ) .",
    "next , a variance spectrum and conventional power spectrum are measured from the uniformly - sampled sfd maps , and an empirical transformation is calculated from the former to the latter (  5.2 ) .",
    "finally , this empirical transformation is applied to the cluster variance spectrum to convert it to a power spectrum , and this allows us to study the composite power spectrum over a wide range of angular scales (  5.3 ) .",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath62 for ngc  4833 is used to determine the relative visual extinction corresponding to the @xmath9-th hb star , @xmath109 . the difference in relative @xmath25 between stars @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath110 , and their angular separation @xmath11",

    "the upper end of this range corresponds to the nyquist frequency of the @xmath41 area covered by the ngc  4833 data set .",
    "the first radial bin of the corrected variance spectrum ( @xmath120 ) is excluded from the power - law fit because it is strongly affected by uncertainties in the photometric error correction .",

    "this provides a good sanity check : it corroborates the result from the analysis of the cluster hb width (  3.3.2 ) that the sfd map is missing small - scale variations on the order of 6% of the reported reddening value .",
    "it also gives an indication of how accurately one can correct for extinction / reddening using the sfd map , with general implications for precision photometry in dusty regions of the sky .      in this section ,",

    "this small - scale power spectrum derived from optical data matches smoothly onto the power spectrum derived from the sfd map at larger angular scales .",

    "while ngc  4833 has an extended blue hb , the methods presented in this paper should be usable for clump hbs or the rgb or any other tight cmd feature for that matter .",
    "for instance , law et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) used the width of the rgb to measure differential reddening in the direction of three  galactic globular clusters , von braun et  al .",

    "there is at least one  generalization of the methodology presented here that might be worth exploring in the future . in determining @xmath3",
    ", we effectively use @xmath5 magnitude to mark where along the hb sequence the extinction / reddening - corrected star lies . a more general definition of a `` locator '' parameter , to mark the position of the unreddened star along any given cmd sequence , may be particularly useful .",
    "for example , multi - wavelength data sets may not have any single observable in common across all of the cmds in question ( unlike the @xmath5 mag for our two  cmds ) , and a color parameter may be more sensitive than @xmath5 mag when using a not - so - vertical cmd feature ( such as the upper portion of ngc  4833 s hb ) .",
    "several high - quality , multi - band ( three or more ) , ground- and space - based photometric data sets have long been available for many star clusters , so the methods presented here can be readily implemented to probe the nature of dust along many lines of sight .",

    "images of clusters in , and even somewhat beyond , the magellanic clouds .",
