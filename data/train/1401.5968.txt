    "we use a two - dimensional explicit electrostatic kinetic pic simulation model @xcite .",
    "the functionality of the code is similar to what we have used earlier to model the positively biased e - sail tether @xcite , but the code is vectorised with agnervector library @xcite and parallelised with the standard message passing interface ( mpi ) and openmp tools .",
    "we run the code with real electron and ion masses .",
    "we simulate a negatively charged tether in plasma flow which is caused by the satellite s orbital motion through the ionosphere .",
    "we use a cartesian coordinate system where @xmath3 is antiparallel with the tether - perpendicular component of the flow , @xmath4 is parallel to the tether and @xmath5 completes a right - handed coordinate system . for convenience",
    "we take the plasma flow to be perpendicular to the tether , which implies no loss in generality .",
    "the simulation is two - dimensional in the tether - perpendicular plane .",
    "a constant external magnetic field is employed in some runs . by default",
    "the plasma is cold oxygen plasma , temperature 0.1 ev , and it flows at 7.5 km / s which corresponds to 4.7 ev bulk flow ion energy .",
    "the tether bias voltage is typically a few hundred volts negative .",

    "above @xmath7 500 km where the plasma brake is relevant ( at lower altitude the neutral drag typically brings satellites down rapidly enough ) , ionospheric plasma consists mainly of o@xmath8 ( 16 amu ) , n@xmath8 ( 14 amu ) , he@xmath8 ( 4 amu ) and h@xmath8 ( 1 amu ) ions .",
    "the main species are o@xmath8 and h@xmath8 ; the minor species n@xmath8 can be summed to o@xmath8 because the masses are approximately similar .",
    "the abundance of o@xmath8 decreases with altitude . at all altitudes",
    ", solar activity tends to increase the oxygen abundance . for the plasma brake ,",
    "the most relevant environment is o@xmath8 plasma because proton plasma produces order of magnitude smaller thrust and helium is usually not a dominant species .",
    "for this reason , the main emphasis in this paper is on o@xmath8 plasma .",
    "runs reported in this paper used 16 nodes on a cray xc30 .",
    "the xc30 consists of compute nodes , each node has 2 processor chips and each chip has 10 2.6 ghz execution cores . the runs reported here used 16 xc30 nodes and achieved @xmath9 particle propagations per second which corresponds to @xmath10 tflops single precision floating point performance .",
    "we first run the code with oxygen plasma and without magnetic field for different values of the tether potential @xmath11 .",
    "the runs are detailed in table [ tab : runlist ] .",
    "the vacuum potential of the tether ( the voltage difference between the tether and the simulation box boundary if there is no plasma inside the box ) is an input parameter to the simulation . after the simulation , the true potential of the tether",
    "is calculated by evaluating the plasma potential at the tether and adding it to the vacuum potential .",
    "for this reason , the tether potential values @xmath11 are not round numbers .",
    "we label the runs partly by their vacuum potential values .",
    "figure [ fig : vdep ] shows the simulated thrust ( determined from particle momentum balance averaged over the last 1/3 of the run ) with open circles .",
    "coloured marks in fig .",
    "[ fig : vdep ] are results from some runs containing a magnetic field and they are described in later subsections below .",
    "the solid line is the following analytical formula , inspired by our earlier work ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation 20 ) : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the dynamic pressure , @xmath14 is the ion mass ( @xmath15 amu for oxygen plasma here ) , @xmath16 is the plasma flow speed relative to spacecraft ( assumed to be perpendicular to the tether or else @xmath16 denotes only the perpendicular component ) , @xmath17 @xmath18 is the tether s effective electric radius ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix a ) , @xmath19 is the effective debye length and @xmath20 is the bulk ion flow energy in voltage units .",
    "the effective electric radius is approximately given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the tether wire radius , typically 12.5 - 25 @xmath0 m , and @xmath23 is the tether width , typically 2 cm ( a rough value of @xmath23 is sufficient to know because @xmath24 enters into eq .",
    "( [ eq : dfdz ] ) only logarithmically ) . in this paper",
    "we use the value @xmath25 mm . the numerical coefficient ( 3.864 ) in front of the expression has been selected to give a good fit to the present simulation results .",
    "this value is about 2.25 times larger than the value 1.72 used in our previous work @xcite .",
    "we think that this difference may arise because in the earlier work we used typical solar wind parameters so that the ratio @xmath26 was about 10 while this ratio is about 100 in the present ionospheric case so that the works explored different regions of the parameter space . in the ionospheric case ,",
    "many ions are deflected backward by the potential well around the tether which increases the thrust markedly in comparison to the solar wind case where the much larger bulk flow speed causes the ions to deflect more modestly .",
    "figure [ fig : curvebaseline ] shows the time history of thrust during the v400 ( baseline ) run , computed by two complementary methods : the direct coulomb force acting on the tether ( by evaluating the numerical gradient of the plasma potential at the tether position ) and the total momentum @xmath3 component lost by particles between entering and leaving the simulation box .",
    "figure [ fig : baselinepcolor ] shows the two - dimensional instantaneous electron and ion density at the final state of the baseline run .    increasing the tether voltage makes the ion sheath larger .",
    "the highest voltage runs ( marked with `` g '' in table [ tab : runlist ] ) were performed with extended box size of 768@xmath27768 to accommodate the larger sheath . as a consistency check ,",
    "run v500 was performed with both grid sizes .",
    "the difference in the determined thrust was minimal ( table [ tab : runlist ] , compare v500 and v500 g ) .",
    "the quasi - monochromatic oscillation seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : curvebaseline ] occurs in runs v300 and higher . in lower voltage",
    "runs the oscillation is absent .",
    "when present , the oscillation neither increases nor decreases with time .",
    "we performed three more runs with the same parameters as v400 ( baseline ) , but with each of the magnetic field components in turn set to 30000 nt , a typical leo field strength .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : curvebx]-[fig : curvebz ] .",
    "it is seen that in runs bx and bz , the oscillation which was already present in the baseline run is now increasing in amplitude .",
    "in contrast , in the by run the oscillation is damped and is going to disappear .",
    "thus , @xmath28 ( magnetic field perpendicular to tether and flow ) is stabilising while flow - directed or tether - directed field is destabilising at the baseline voltage .    the final state of run bx is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bxpcolor ] .",
    "the sheath surrounding the tether is unstable and radiates plasma waves in all directions in the @xmath29 plane . in the tether - fixed coordinate frame ,",
    "the waves move approximately at the same phase speed as the bulk flow ( 7.5 km / s ) .",
    "the waves appear to move with the ion flow which is reflected by the tether s potential well . the incoming flow has a mach number of @xmath30 with respect to ion acoustic wave speed . because of energy conservation , reflected ions move radially outward with the same speed as the incoming flow .",
    "the tether s potential well fluctuates , which modulates the flow of outward reflected ions .",
    "the modulations propagate outward approximately at the same speed as the ions because the ion acoustic speed is less than the bulk velocity of the outward moving ion population . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bxpcolor ] one can also see that the @xmath3-directed magnetic field tends to restrict electron motion in @xmath5 , which creates some horizontal stripes seen in the figure ( reddish stripes on positive @xmath3 ) , visible in both electron and ion density and emanating from the edges of the electron cavity .",
    "figure [ fig : bzpcolor ] shows the final state of run bz .",
    "again the state is unstable and",
    "the tether s potential well radiates plasma waves .",
    "additionally , the boundaries of the plasma wake behind the tether display some turbulent behaviour .",
    "this probably occurs because now the magnetic field is along the tether so that electrons respond to @xmath3 and @xmath5 directed electric fields by @xmath31 drifting ( similar to kelvin - helmholtz instability in plane perpendicular to @xmath32 ) .",
    "not surprisingly , the horizontal stripes which were visible in the bx run ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bxpcolor ] ) are now absent .",
    "figures [ fig : curvehelium ] and [ fig : curveproton ] show thrust histories for helium and proton plasma , respectively , and with other parameters in their baseline ( v400 ) values . in both light ion cases ,",
    "an unstable oscillation is present .",
    "the instability grows faster in the proton run than in the helium run and has time to evolve into intermittent , nonlinear regime .",
    "figure [ fig : protonpcolor ] shows the final state of the proton run .",
    "some ions have become trapped by the potential well which has decreased the thrust to some extent ( fig .",
    "[ fig : curveproton ] ) .",
    "the sheath emits plasma waves in all @xmath29 directions .",
    "the flow mach number with respect to ion acoustic speed is low ( 1.2 ) which is probably the reason why the wake behind the tether is rather short ( the wake gets filled quickly from the boundaries because the ion thermal speed is almost as large as the flow speed ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : protonpcolor ] the behaviour of the densities near the inflow boundary ( right side ) shows some @xmath5-directed striping and does not look completely natural .",
    "it is possible that the finite box size affects the result to some extent in this case . in the proton case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : protonpcolor ] ) it is also noteworthy that the emitted ion waves have short enough wavelength that the electron density does not follow the ion density , in other words , that the emitted wavelength is not much larger than the electron debye length .",
    "formula [ eq : dfdz ] predicts 12.2 nn / m in the helium case and 2.92 nn / m in the proton case .",
    "the simulated values at 2.43 ms are larger ( 14.6 and 5.05 nn / m , respectively ) , even though in the proton run some ion trapping had already occurred which had reduced the thrust .",
    "probably the smaller dynamic pressure of light ion bulk flow depresses the sheath less than in the oxygen case , and this effect is not included in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dfdz ] ) where the thrust is assumed to be linearly proportional to the ion mass . in the helium run ( not shown ) the behaviour is intermediate between the oxygen and proton runs . in subsection [",
    "subsection : longerruns ] below we will investigate longer time behaviour of proton plasma where also a magnetic field is included .      in all runs thus far presented we have assumed that the electron temperature is 0.1 ev ( the same as ion temperature ) . in the 700 - 900 km altitude range , the electron temperature is actually often 0.2 - 0.3 ev .",
    "figure [ fig : curvete ] shows thrust behaviour of a run ( named te ) which is otherwise identical to baseline ( v400 ) , but the electron temperature is set to 0.3 ev .",
    "the thrust remains essentially unchanged and the oscillation is damped .",
    "so run te suggests that a higher electron temperature improves stability .",
    "figure [ fig : curvebxlong ] shows longer time behaviour ( @xmath33 timesteps , 23.4 ms ) of the thrust in the presence of @xmath3-directed magnetic field .",
    "the result indicates that after about 7 ms , the thrust no longer decreases while intermittent unstable wave activity continues .",
    "the asymptotic value of the thrust as determined from the run is 40.9 nn / m which is only 11% less than in v400 ( baseline ) when the difference in voltage between the runs ( 311 v versus 337 v ) is compensated for by a square root dependence .",
    "hence the simulation suggests that the instability caused by an @xmath3-directed magnetic field decreases the plasma brake thrust only slightly at the baseline voltage .",
    "figure [ fig : curvebzlong ] shows the corresponding result for @xmath4-directed magnetic field .",
    "the behaviour is similar except that the fluctuation spectrum extends to somewhat lower frequencies .",
    "the final state thrust 38.7 nn / m is 17% lower than voltage - corrected baseline .",
    "figure [ fig : curvev1000bzlong ] shows the result with higher voltage ( 757 v which is 2.4 times larger than baseline ) and @xmath4-directed field .",
    "the fluctuations are strong and the thrust 53.8 nn / m is 27% lower than voltage - corrected baseline .",
    "thus the relative gap between the bz and @xmath34 cases increases with voltage .",
    "the increase of the gap is slower than linear , however , since it increases from 17% to @xmath727% if the voltage is made 2.4 times stronger .",
    "the thrust curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : curvev1000bzlong ] might not yet be completely stabilised at the end of the run so the thrust estimate derived from the simulation in this case might somewhat overestimated .    the @xmath3-directed magnetic field case with high 856 v voltage is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : curvev1000bx ] .",
    "this run provides a positive surprise since initial transients now die away quickly after which the state is stable and the thrust is even somewhat larger than eq .",
    "( [ eq : dfdz ] ) prediction .",
    "thus , although @xmath3-directed field at lower voltage is unstable and the instability lowers the thrust to a small extent ( run bxlong ) , at higher voltage the instability is absent and instead of a small thrust reduction we have a minor thrust enhancement .",
    "next we look at the asymptotic state in the strongly unstable proton case ( see subsection [ subsection : ionmass ] above ) where in addition a destabilising bz magnetic field exists .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : curveprotonbzlong ] .",
    "the fluctuations are strong , but the average magnitude of the thrust gets stabilised during the run .",
    "thus , even strongly unstable behaviour does not cause a collapse of the ion sheath which surrounds the tether and whose spatial extent determines the thrust .",
    "interestingly , the determined thrust of 2.91 nn / m at @xmath35 v is exactly ( within three decimal places ) equal to eq .",
    "( [ eq : dfdz ] ) prediction .",
    "likely the @xmath34 value of the thrust in case of proton plasma would be slightly above eq .",
    "( [ eq : dfdz ] ) prediction , while @xmath36 tends to slightly lower the thrust . that the effects cancel out exactly may be fortuitous .",
    "we also made a run where the magnetic field components had equal values : @xmath37 nt@xmath38 .",
    "the result is an intermediate case of the bx , by and bz runs : a very slowly growing oscillation appears .",
    "it therefore seems that the behaviour is stable if the magnetic field is predominantly in the @xmath5 direction and unstable otherwise .",
    "the result suggests that if the magnetic field has general orientation , the behaviour can be qualitatively interpolated from the x , y and z directed runs .    when the plasma density @xmath39 is changed , all spatial scales in the electrostatic pic simulation model scale naturally by the electron debye length i.e.  as @xmath40 .",
    "the only thing that breaks this scale invariance is the fixed value of the tether s effective electric radius @xmath18 .",
    "however , the effect of @xmath18 is minor because it enters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dfdz ] ) only logarithmically .",
    "thus we can say that changing the plasma density @xmath39 does not affect the stable / unstable nature of the solution and the thrust scales nearly as proportional to @xmath41 . as a consistency check",
    ", we made one run to verify this behaviour .",
    "we also performed a high voltage run with @xmath5-directed field , v1000by ( table [ tab : runlist ] ) with short 2.43 ms duration because only a weak stable oscillation is present and no instability is seen . as in the corresponding lower voltage run by , the determined thrust 80.7 nn / m is in close agreement with eq .",
    "[ eq : dfdz ] .",
    "in eq .  ( [ eq : dfdz ] ) the thrust is nearly linearly proportional to the ion mass and the simulations are in agreement with this at least qualitatively .    at @xmath42",
    "v , the runs bxlong and bzlong suggest that although the plasma sheath is unstable when an @xmath3 or @xmath4 dominant magnetic field is present , the thrust is reduced by the instability only modestly ( 11% and 17% , respectively ) .",
    "when the voltage is increased to @xmath43 v , a @xmath4-directed field is again unstable ( v1000bzlong ) and the thrust reduction is larger , @xmath44% . in case of @xmath3-directed field , however , the instability is absent and there is actually a small thrust enhancement ( v1000bx ) .",
    "a @xmath5-directed field is always stable and there is neither thrust reduction nor enhancement .    in other words ,",
    "( [ eq : dfdz ] ) is in most cases able to predict the thrust well .",
    "the only exception is that if the magnetic field is aligned with the tether ( @xmath4-directed case ) , then there is a moderate thrust reduction which increases with voltage .",
    "the relative reduction is 17% at 320 v and @xmath44% at 760 v for @xmath4-directed magnetic field .    when @xmath34 , the flow is stable with oxygen plasma and unstable with proton plasma ( runs v400 and proton ) .",
    "when an instability sets in , the ion cloud formed by ions passing near the tether starts to oscillate at ion plasma frequency . in the oxygen case",
    "the ion plasma oscillation is 4 times slower than in the proton case . in the oxygen case",
    "the flow has time to move by more than one ion sheath diameter during one ion plasma period , while in the proton case it moves only a fraction of the sheath diameter .",
    "thus in the proton plasma case , if the sheath starts to oscillate , the oscillations have more opportunities to disturb the upstream flow and perhaps cause a positive nonlinear feedback .",
    "maybe this is why lighter ion mass flow tends to be more unstable .",
    "another way to arrive at a qualitatively similar conclusion is to note that the ion bulk flow kinetic energy @xmath45 is linearly proportional to the ion mass .",
    "thus the ratio @xmath26 is 16 times larger in proton plasma flow than in o@xmath8 ion flow .",
    "any voltage dependent instability should then occur at 16 times lower voltage in proton plasma than in o@xmath8 plasma .",
    "let us consider a vertical gravity gradient stabilised plasma brake tether using the untilted dipole approximation for earth s magnetic field .",
    "the untilted dipole approximation can be used in this case because runs where all field components had nonzero values seemed to interpolate smoothly from purely aligned runs ( section [ subsect : misc ] ) , i.e.  exact orientation of the magnetic field does not seem to matter .",
    "in this approximation , in equatorial orbit the magnetic field is @xmath5-directed all the time and the thrust is consequently predicted well by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dfdz ] ) .",
    "the same is true in polar orbit in low latitudes . only for the high latitude portion of a polar orbit",
    "the thrust is somewhat smaller than what eq .",
    "( [ eq : dfdz ] ) predicts .",
    "let us look at a numeric example . at 1 kv voltage , @xmath46 m@xmath47 density and oxygen plasma , the predicted plasma brake thrust from eq .",
    "[ eq : dfdz ] is 85 nn / m .",
    "a 5 km long tether would produce 0.43 mn braking force which is equivalent to 13400 ns impulse per year . at 800 km altitude , reducing the orbital altitude by 100 km requires 52 m / s of delta - v , thus the exemplary 5 km tether ( mass 0.055 kg , @xcite ) could lower the orbital altitude of a 260 kg object by 100 km during one year .",
    "the gathered oxygen ion current per tether length is given by the orbital motion limited ( oml ) theory expression as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the total width of the four - wire tether ( 160 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "hence a 5 km tether gathers 0.4 ma current and consumes 0.4 w power in this plasma . in reality",
    "the current is expected to be somewhat larger because of production of some secondary electrons from the tether when hit by oxygen ions . for comparison ,",
    "the maximal lorentz force produced by the tether @xcite ( using the length - averaged current of 0.2 ma ) is only 0.03 mn which is 14 times smaller than the plasma brake force in this case .",
    "we did not test voltages higher than about 860 v in this paper .",
    "going to higher voltages tends to increase the needed computing time because the sheath becomes larger so one needs more grid cells , particles and timesteps to model its asymptotic evolution accurately . in a practical device ,",
    "if one increases the negative voltage , at some point electron field emission from the surface of the tether wires starts to become an issue .",
    "field emission adds to the ionic current gathered by the tether and hence increases power consumption .",
    "we think that the point where field emission starts to become an issue is larger than 1 kv but smaller than perhaps 3 - 5 kv .",
    "the value also depends on the geometry and possible coating of the tether . before experimental knowledge about the plasma brake",
    "is obtained , it is not necessarily well motivated to try simulations with higher voltages than those presented in this paper .      the reference @xcite contains an error : the quantities which are in the present paper denoted by @xmath50 and @xmath11 were confused with each other .",
    "therefore the thrust versus voltage relationship as given in @xcite was too optimistic .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite used an earlier formula ( * ? ? ? * equation 20 ) whose numerical coefficient had been found from a test particle calculation using solar wind parameters . in the ionospheric plasma brake case ,",
    "the ratio between the tether voltage @xmath11 and the bulk flow energy @xmath51 ( in voltage units ) is much larger than in the solar wind , and consequently ions are reflected backward more efficiently in the ionosphere than in the solar wind , as is evident from the simulation results of the present paper .",
    "all in all , the results of @xcite are not too far from reality : the error resulting from confusing @xmath50 and @xmath11 and the inaccuracy resulting from using a formula suitable for solar wind roughly cancel out each other .    according to a series of electrostatic pic simulations performed at different parameters , eq .",
    "( [ eq : dfdz ] ) can be used to predict plasma brake thrust in ionospheric conditions . only if the dominant component of the magnetic field is along the tether , the thrust is reduced , and the relative reduction grows from 17% to @xmath44% when the voltage increases from 320 v to 760 v. the thrust reduction is due to an instability which has ionic character .",
    "the predicted performance of the plasma brake seems promising concerning satellite deorbiting applications .",
    "for example in o@xmath8 plasma with @xmath46 m@xmath47 density and using 1 kv voltage , a 5 km long plasma brake tether weighing 0.055 kg could produce 0.43 mn breaking force at altitude @xmath43 km , which is enough to reduce the orbital altitude of a 260 kg debris mass by 100 km during one year .",

    "<S> the plasma brake @xcite is an efficient propellantless concept for deorbiting low earth orbit ( leo ) satellites . </S>",
    "<S> the plasma brake is a very thin negatively charged tether which , when charged , causes a braking force by creating enhanced coulomb drag with ambient ionospheric plasma ram flow . </S>",
    "<S> the plasma brake tether is somewhat similar to the more well known electrodynamic tether @xcite , but is much thinner and uses electrostatic rather than magnetic forces .    </S>",
    "<S> because the plasma brake 4-wire ultrasonically bonded tether is thin , it is lightweight , 11 grams per kilometre @xcite and does not form an appreciable threat to other satellites even in case of tether breakage . a broken piece of plasma brake tether deorbits itself quickly because of electromagnetic forces and neutral drag , and even if the tether piece would collide with a satellite , the 25 - 50 @xmath0 m wires draw only @xmath1 mm deep scratches on its surface . </S>",
    "<S> said electromagnetic forces are a passive coulomb drag effect and to a lesser extent the passive electrodynamic tether effect . </S>",
    "<S> the broken tether piece experiences an orbital motion induced natural electric field , and whenever this field has a component along the tether , one end of the tether gets charged negatively and the other one positively with respect to the local plasma , causing electrostatic coulomb drag and electromagnetic lorentz drag . </S>",
    "<S> although the passive electromagnetic drag effects are weaker than the active ones , the very low specific mass of the tether ( @xmath2 kg / km ) makes passive deorbiting of a broken tether piece fast , typically .    to maintain a tether at positive voltage in the solar wind requires an electron gun @xcite that pumps out negatively charged particles from the system and thereby cancels the tether s gathered plasma current . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , to maintain a tether at negative voltage can be accomplished with a positive ion gun . however , in leo the maintenance of the plasma brake tether s negative voltage in most cases does not require an ion gun since the satellite s conducting body can be used as the current balancing electron gathering surface @xcite . if the satellite s grounded and conducting surface area is insufficiently small for this purpose , a relatively short positively biased tether made of similar material than the main tether could be used for gathering the required balancing electron current .    </S>",
    "<S> the topic of the paper is to use a realistic electrostatic particle in cell ( pic ) simulation to model the interaction between the negatively biased plasma brake tether with the surrounding ionospheric plasma ram flow which moves at a typical satellite orbital speed of 7.5 km / s . </S>",
    "<S> we run the code with different voltages , different magnetic field orientations and different ion species and determine the thrust per tether length in each case </S>",
    "<S> . we will also present a simple analytical formula for plasma brake thrust which reproduces the simulation results . </S>"
