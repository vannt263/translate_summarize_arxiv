    "<S> the simplest way   to realize @xmath20 as an iso - triplet scalar state is to assign it to @xmath24[\\bar s\\bar n]_{i=1},\\,(n = u,\\,d)$ ] in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> however , it decays into two states with opposite @xmath41-parities@xcite , @xmath42 this is puzzling because the well - known strong interactions conserve @xmath41-parity . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it has been noted  @xcite that the decay @xmath43 proceeds through @xmath44 . because a search for its charged partners @xmath45 has given a negative result  @xcite , however </S>",
    "<S> , it would be an iso - singlet state , and isospin conservation does not work in the decay . </S>",
    "<S> besides , it has been pointed out  @xcite that the @xmath46 decay proceeds through the sub - threshold @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> if isospin is conserved in this decay , @xmath34 would be an iso - singlet state . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the above negative result on @xmath45 .    </S>",
    "<S> although various approaches  @xcite have been proposed to solve the above puzzle , they are unnatural because the well - known @xmath48 mixing  @xcite as the origin of the isospin non - conservation in nuclear forces , which is compatible  @xcite with the measured rate for the @xmath49 decay  @xcite , has not been considered . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that @xmath34 is a tetra - quark system like @xmath50(\\bar c\\bar n ) + ( cn)[\\bar c\\bar n]\\}_{i=0}$ ] meson  @xcite ( or a @xmath51 molecule ) with even @xmath39-parity and that the isospin non - conservation under consideration is caused by the @xmath48 mixing  @xcite , we have reproduced  @xcite the measured ratios , @xmath52 given by the belle  @xcite and babar  @xcite , respectively , where @xmath53 is defined by @xmath54 . in the above , we have considered the @xmath55 decay in place of @xmath56 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:3pi/2pi - exp ] ) , because both of them are controlled by the same subthreshold @xmath57 decay when the vector meson dominance ( vmd )  @xcite is applied to the radiative decay , while the kinematics of the former is much simpler than the latter . in contrast , if @xmath34 were assumed to be a charmonium @xmath58 , the @xmath38 pole contribution , @xmath59 , would be dominant in the radiative decay because of the ozi rule  @xcite , and as the result , @xmath60 would be obtained  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we see that a tetra - quark interpretation of @xmath34 is favored over the charmonium , although a small mixing of @xmath58 is not excluded . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , it should be noted that production  @xcite of the @xmath34 seems to favor a compact object like a tetra - quark meson over a loosely bound molecule  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although an argument against the above conclusion was proposed  @xcite , it does not explicitly prove that a loosely bound molecule provides a sufficiently large cross section for the prompt @xmath34 production . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the @xmath51 molecule involves some other problems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> tetra - quark interpretations of @xmath20 and @xmath34 have been favored by experiments as seen above , although their quantum numbers are not exotic . therefore , observation of their partners would be needed to establish the above interpretations . </S>",
    "<S> however , for example , neutral and doubly charged partners , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , of @xmath25 have not been observed in inclusive @xmath19 annihilation  . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it does not imply their non - existence but a in this process . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood by considering a production mechanism in the framework of minimal @xmath63 pair creation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , in @xmath26 decays , their production rates have been estimated as  , @xmath64 , because the above decays are described by the same type of quark - line diagrams and hence the sizes of their amplitudes are expected to be nearly equal to each other . </S>",
