    "max - plus or tropical convexity has been developed by several researchers under different names , with various motivations .",
    "it goes back at least to the work of zimmermann  @xcite .",
    "it was studied by litvinov , maslov , and shpiz  @xcite , in relation to problems of calculus of variations , and by cohen , gaubert , and quadrat  @xcite , motivated by discrete event system problems ( max - plus polyhedra represent invariant spaces of max - plus linear dynamical systems  @xcite ) .",
    "some of this work was pursued with singer ( see  @xcite ) , with motivations from generalized convexity  @xcite .",
    "the work of briec and horvath  @xcite is also in the setting of generalized convexity .",
    "develin and sturmfels  @xcite pointed out some remarkable relations with tropical geometry , and developed a new approach , thinking of tropical polyhedra as polyhedral complexes in the usual sense .",
    "this was the starting point of several works of the same authors , of joswig  @xcite and of block and yu  @xcite .",
    "some of the previously mentioned researchers , and some other ones , including allamigeon , butkovi , goubault , katz , nitica , meunier , sergeev , schneider , have recently made a number of works in the field , we refer the reader to  @xcite for a representative set of contributions .",
    "a closed convex set can be represented classically in two different ways , either internally , in terms of extreme elements ( extreme points and rays ) and lineality space , or externally , as the intersection of ( closed ) half - spaces .",
    "the max - plus or tropical analogue of the external representation , specially in the case of polyhedra , is the main object of this paper .",
    "the existence of an external representation relies on separation arguments . in the max - plus setting ,",
    "several separations theorems have been obtained , with various degrees of generality and precision , by zimmermann  @xcite , by samborski and shpiz  @xcite , by cohen , gaubert , and quadrat  @xcite with a further refinement in a work with singer  @xcite , and by develin and sturmfels  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the results of  @xcite yield a simple geometric construction of the separating half - space , showing the analogy with the hilbert space case .",
    "this geometric approach was extended to the case of the separation of several convex sets by gaubert and sergeev  @xcite , using a cyclic projection method .",
    "briec and horvath derived a separation theorem for two convex sets using a different approach  @xcite .",
    "the existence of an internal representation relies on krein - milman type theorems .",
    "results of this kind were established by butkovi , schneider , and sergeev  @xcite and by the authors  @xcite , who also studied in  @xcite the analogue of the polar of a convex set , which consists of the set of inequalities satisfied by its elements .",
    "polyhedra are usually defined by the condition that they have a finite external or internal representation , the equivalence of both conditions being the classical minkowski - weyl theorem .    in the max - plus setting , a first result of this nature was established by gaubert in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "iii , th .",
    "1.2.2 ) , who showed that a finitely generated max - plus cone can be characterized by finitely many max - plus linear inequalities .",
    "one element of the proof is an argument showing that the set of solutions of a system of max - plus linear equations is finitely generated , an observation which was already made by butkovi and hegedus  @xcite .",
    "some accounts in english of the result of  @xcite appeared in  @xcite .    to address the same issue",
    ", joswig  @xcite introduced the very interesting notion of minimal half - spaces ( tropical half - spaces that are minimal for inclusion among the ones containing a given tropical polytope ) , he stated that the apex of such a tropical half - space is a vertex of the classical polyhedral complex arising from the polytope , and deduced that there are only finitely many such minimal half - spaces .",
    "this statement was refined by a conjecture of block and yu , characterizing the minimal half - spaces , in the generic case  ( * ? ? ?",
    "the finiteness of the number of minimal half - spaces is an appealing property , which is geometrically quite obvious in dimension 2 .",
    "it came to us as a surprise that it does not hold in higher dimensions .",
    "we give here a counter example ( example  [ ejemplo1 ] below ) , contradicting the finiteness of the number of minimal half - spaces containing a tropical polyhedron ( corollary  3.4 of  @xcite ) and disproving conjecture  14 of  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the present counter example is based on a general characterization of the minimal half - spaces , theorem  [ theocharacmin ] below , the main result of this paper , which gives some answer to the question at the origin of the conjecture of block and yu .    in a preliminary section",
    ", we establish an analogue of the minkowski - weyl theorem ( theorem  [ th - mw ] ) , showing that a tropical polyhedron can be equivalently described either as the sum of the convex hull of finitely many points and of the cone generated by finitely many vectors , or as the intersection of finitely many half - spaces ( there is no tropical analogue of the lineality space ) . the proof is based on the idea of  @xcite ( theorem  [ minkowskiweylcones ] below ) , which is combined with the results of  @xcite .    in the final section ,",
    "we characterize the extreme elements of the polar of a tropical polyhedral cone .",
    "the set of extreme elements of this polar has the property that any inequality satisfied by all the elements of the cone is a max - plus linear combination of the inequalities represented by these extreme elements , and it is the unique minimal set with this property ( up to a scaling ) . in particular , these extreme elements provide a finite representation of the original polyhedron as the intersection of half - spaces .",
    "theorem  [ theocharacextreme ] below characterizes these extreme elements , showing in particular that each of them is determined by support vectors .",
    "let us first recall some basic definitions .",
    "the max - plus semiring , @xmath0 , is the set @xmath1 equipped with the addition @xmath2 and the multiplication @xmath3 . to emphasize the semiring structure , we write @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the term `` tropical '' is now used essentially as a synonym of max - plus .",
    "the semiring operations are extended in the natural way to matrices over the max - plus semiring : @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 for all @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are matrices of compatible sizes and @xmath13 .",

    "order ) , which can be defined by the metric : @xmath19 .",
    "the set @xmath20 is equipped with the product topology ( resp .",
    "note that the semiring operations are continuous with respect to this topology .",
    "a subset @xmath21 of @xmath20 is said to be a _",
    "max - plus or tropical cone _ if it is stable by max - plus linear combinations , meaning that @xmath22 for all @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "note that , in the max - plus setting , positivity constraints are implicit because any scalar @xmath13 satisfies @xmath25 . as a consequence , max - plus cones turn out to share many properties with classical convex cones .",
    "this analogy leads to define _ max - plus convex subsets _",
    "@xmath26 of @xmath20 by requiring them to be stable by max - plus convex combinations , meaning that @xmath27 holds for all @xmath28 and @xmath29 such that @xmath30 .",
    "we denote by @xmath31 the smallest cone containing a subset @xmath32 of @xmath20 , and by @xmath33 the smallest convex set containing it .",
    "therefore , @xmath31 ( resp .",
    "@xmath33 ) is the set of all max - plus linear ( resp .",
    "convex ) combinations of finitely many elements of @xmath32 .",
    "a cone @xmath21 is said to be finitely generated if there exists a finite set @xmath32 such that @xmath34 , which equivalently means that @xmath35 for some matrix @xmath36 .",

    ", the latter set can be written as @xmath41 note that half - spaces are max - plus cones .",
    "classical polyhedra can be defined either as a finite intersection of affine half - spaces , or in terms of finite sets of vertices and rays , i.e.   as the minkowski sum of a polytope and a finitely generated cone .",
    "here we adopt the first approach and define a _",
    "max - plus or tropical polyhedron _ as the intersection of finitely many affine half - spaces .",
    "we warn the reader that our notion of polyhedra is more general than the one used in  @xcite ( the latter reference deals with max - plus cones having a finite generating family consisting of vectors with finite entries ) .",
    "the following `` conic '' form of the minkowski - weyl theorem is equivalent to a result established in  @xcite , showing that a finitely generated max - plus cone is characterized by finitely many max - plus linear equalities .",
    "this result was reproduced ( but without its proof ) in the surveys  @xcite . for the convenience of the reader",
    ", we include the proof here .",
    "the `` if '' part is equivalent to the existence of a finite set of generators of a system of max - plus linear equations , which was first shown in  @xcite . there have been recently progresses on these issues , leading to a much faster algorithm , see  @xcite .",
