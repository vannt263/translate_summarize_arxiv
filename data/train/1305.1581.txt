    "however , when we relax these assumptions about the elemental makeup of the knot , we find a physical state that could explain the observed spectral stasis .",
    "we can turn our limits on @xmath89 into an upper limit on the electron density , since the plasma evolution depends on @xmath90 , for a given time baseline .",
    "a very generous upper limit is given by considering a @xmath86 change given by the difference between the epoch 2009.8 90%  upper - limit @xmath7 value and the epoch 2000.2 90%  lower - limit value .",
    "dividing this @xmath91 by the time baseline gives the `` @xmath90 ( 90% limits ) '' values in table  [ tab : netable ] , which are in the 10 s to 100 s of @xmath92 .",
    "the conversion of ` vnei `  parameters to plasma density is straightforward , although not typically implemented in the modeling software .",
    "paper a  outlines the technique ( and we detail the calculation in appendix  [ sec : acis - anal ] ) : approximate the average number of electrons stripped per ion , then convert that to an absolute density through factors of the ` vnei `  abundances and emission norm , by approximating the knot as a uniform density spheroid .",
    "the 2004.4 epoch model parameters are used to produce the densities `` @xmath90 ( nominal ) '' given in table  [ tab : netable ] .",
    "the values are too high above the upper limit densities .",
    "the straightforward calculations of @xmath90 yielded values too high , so we must find out how to reduce the density while maintaining spectral consistency .",
    "our derivation of the electron density leaves us with only a few slightly adjustable parameters to tune :    @xmath93 namely @xmath94  the ` vnei `  abundance of hydrogen relative to solar , @xmath95  the number of electrons per hydrogen ion in the plasma , and @xmath13  the filling fraction of the material in the emitting volume .",
    "( the uncertainties of the distance measurements to cas a translate to only a 4% error in the density , so we neglect that parameter . )",
    "we can start by changing the first two parameters with a different chemical makeup for the knot .",

    ". we can investigate alternate abundance sets of low - z elements that produce the same continuum , yet lead to different values of @xmath90 .",
    "for instance , higher z elements have more electrons to give up , so can compensate for a lower abundance of h.    as an example of this continuum degeneracy , we consider a predominantly c and n makeup .",
    "( cas  a exhibits little emission from c or n , but we care about the lack of h and he in this straw man model . ) changing the \\{h , he , c , n , o } abundances from \\{1 , 1 , 5 , 5 , 5 } to a c- and n - rich plasma with \\{0.002 , 0.20 , 45 , 45 , 5 } will produce a spectral model with the same norm , but a reduced @xmath90 .",
    "( we increase c and n , but not o , based on the results of @xcite , though a n - rich plasma could do the same job . ) tweaking the abundances this way increases @xmath95 by about 100 , partially undercutting the benefit of a lower @xmath94 .",
    "the resulting @xmath90 values ( `` @xmath90 ( cn - rich ) '' column in table  [ tab : netable ] ) are reduced by over a factor of 2 , but remain comfortably above the upper limits .",
    "this chemical makeup can not explain the lack of evolution .",
    "we discard the cn - rich model , but the above example of an enriched metal plasma motivates an extreme scenario : a plasma constituted only of elements with @xmath96 .",

    "the lack of evolution for many knots could therefore be explained by a low density , si - rich plasma component .    to make this metal - rich knot model more physical  and spectrally consistent",
    " we need only split our nominal knot into two components . for both components , we use the same parameters as the nominal knot : the 2004.4 maximum likelihood @xmath60 , @xmath7 , and abundances ( with the fiducial continuum set \\{h , he , c , n , o } @xmath69 \\{1 , 1 , 5 , 5 , 5 } ) .",
    "the metal - rich component is given an 85% fill fraction , and the elements with @xmath98 are assigned contamination - level abundances of @xmath99 solar .",

    "the two models with complementary abundance sets recover the same well fitting spectral model as the nominal case ( figure  [ fig : knot - cartoon ] ) .",
    "unlike the cn - rich case , the altered chemical composition results in slightly higher @xmath95 , while @xmath94 is cut by a factor of 100 .",
    "the resulting @xmath90 s for the metal - rich components  which contain the si we have been using as a tracker of evolution  are below the upper limit values ( table  [ tab : netable ] ) , consistent with the non - evolution we observe .",

    "though we found no other simple solution to regain self - consistency , we acknowledge the model presented here may not be the only answer .",
    "this dissociated plasma is made up of low density pure ejecta and a low - z component .",
    "the low - z ( @xmath100 ) plasma provides the continuum emission we see and has higher density : the @xmath90 s range from 3001600 @xmath92 , which correspond to radiative cooling times greater than 1900 years .",
    "this low - z plasma would be physically separated from a less dense , ejecta - rich ( @xmath101 ) plasma that accounts for the observed line emission .",
    "these plasmas share the same @xmath60 and @xmath7 , by construction , so the dual model sums to single - component ` vnei `  model , reproducing the good spectral fits ( figure  [ fig : knot - cartoon ] ) . only the interpretation of the physical picture",
    "is changed : the components are unmixed",
    ".    the data in this work can not constrain the specific physical model for knot dissociation , but hydrodynamical simulations offer indications .",
    "we envision a low density parcel of pure high - z ejecta pushing into a denser layer of low - z material ahead of it , much like the tip of a rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) finger .",
    "the high - z component , though , could manifest as an expanding clump implanted into the low - z plasma , or be turbulently mixed on finer scales .    ]    the scales for this dissociation would be small , if the components are not separated along the line of sight .",
    "@xcite found evidence for well mixed ejecta in cas a , down to @xmath102 ( @xmath103 cm ) .",
    "likewise , our knot - defining algorithm did not see large spectral differences at the pixel scale .",

    "our proposed model would require dissociation as a line - of - sight effect , or at scales unresolved by the _",
    "chandra _",
    "optics , which have a psf matched to the pixel size , @xmath106 ( @xmath107 cm ) .    early - times explosion models",

    "@xcite found strong mixing on large scales , with high - z bullets probing deep into the outer hydrogen layer .",
    "the smallest structures at 2.5 hours span @xmath108 cm , roughly the size of these x - ray knots at that time .",
    "the work of @xcite found that mixing can persist longer ( @xmath109 day after the explosion ) .",
    "the rapid expansion of the remnant may leave elemental mixing incomplete , though to date there have been no studies to determine on what scale ( private communication , h. janka , 2011 ) .    in the late - stage mixing simulations , several enhancements to the rt mixing",
    "have been suggested to force the fingers through the whole intershock region , where our si - rich knots lie .",
    "rt instabilities could reach to the forward shock with the help of high enough compression ratios @xcite , large , underdense fe bubbles colliding with the reverse shock @xcite or high density contrasts in the originating ejecta clumps @xcite .",
    "@xcite observe density contrasts of 3 to 4 orders of magnitude over 0.5 pc ( for a 1000 yr old simulated remnant ) , while we claim contrasts of just over 1 order of magnitude , spanning @xmath110 pc in cas a.    the recent work of @xcite aims to bridge the early and late epochs .",
    "their simulations have evolved cas a to 30 years , but have revealed little mixing between the si and o layers , in contrast with @xcite and @xcite , who found more si in the rt fingers .",
    "we await their extended simulations to compare with our dissociated metal hypothesis .",
    "it is worth noting that our dissociated model remains simple , with a shared temperature and ionization age .",
    "if the ejecta are not fully mixed at these small scales , we would expect the two components to have different temperatures and ionization ages , though we achieve good spectral agreement without turning these additional knobs .",
    "this additional freedom could reconcile our differences with paper a s @xmath60 and @xmath7 values .",
    "( initial investigations show that , if freed , @xmath60 and @xmath7 for the high - z component would not change much , while the dissociated model permits a much wider range of low - z @xmath7 values . )",
    "if this dissociation is the answer to the non - evolution riddle , it could inform elemental mixing during supernova explosions .",
    "the brightened knot , r21 , which we added to the set from paper a , was also investigated in @xcite .",
    "they too claimed spectral evolution in r21 , with @xmath60 increasing from 1.1 to 1.5 kev from 2002 to 2004 , and @xmath7 increasing from @xmath111 to @xmath112 . from 2000 to 2004 , our results show a similar increase in temperature , but @xmath7 is not only lower ( @xmath113 ) , but fairly constant over that period .",
    "the disparities may arise from different model assumptions : both analyses use an nei model with variable abundances , but @xcite fit the spectrum over a smaller energy range , did not tie parameters across epochs , and derived only single - parameter confidence intervals .    in general , for many of the knots , the brightness of the si lines changed dramatically  up to a factor of 3  over the decade , as figure [ fig : hetgvalues ] shows .",
    "however , a large - area , broadband investigation of cas  a by @xcite showed only the slightest decrease in 1.5  3.0 kev flux in the same period .",
    "evidently , the uncorrelated variations in the individual knots average out over time and position , giving the impression of steady thermal emission that @xcite observe .",
    "we have found that the ` vnei `  parameters _ kt _ and @xmath7 are often anti - correlated . a higher _ kt _ and lower @xmath7 can produce a spectrum with equal statistical likelihood to one with lower _ kt _ and higher @xmath7 .",
    "the characteristic of this degeneracy is a banana - shaped confidence contour , such as in figure [ fig : evolvingknot ] .",
    "there is a physical justification for the strong anti - correlation between @xmath60 and @xmath7 .",
    "the equilibrium ratio of the si h - like ly-@xmath14 to the he - like triplet for a plasma is monotonically increasing with temperature .",
    "as a nei plasma evolves toward cie , this ratio also monotonically increases with @xmath86 .",
    "thus , for a given spectrum , models with higher @xmath60 and lower @xmath86 or models with lower @xmath60 and higher @xmath7 can result in the same likelihood .    this degeneracy explains why the discrepancies in the @xmath60 and @xmath7 values derived in paper a  and in this analysis are anti - correlated .",
    "had we not used 2-dimensional confidence contours for the 2 ` vnei `  parameters of interest , we would have come to different conclusions about the data , due to problems that arise with the use of 1-dimensional confidence intervals for multidimensional data .",
    "first , during the interval generation for one parameter , the other parameters of interest are treated as nuisance parameters , which is wrong from a mathematical perspective ( the incorrect @xmath81 distribution is used ) .",
    "second , the use of a @xmath81 distribution with fewer degrees of freedom underestimates the parameter uncertainty .",
    "moreover , any underlying correlations are lost , leaving the analyst susceptible to false trends in best fit values , when in fact those points may live in the same `` banana . ''",
    "we have performed a detailed analysis of two hetg and four acis observations of cas a spanning a 10-year baseline .",
    "a new set of detailed plasma kinematic and temperatures measurements has been presented .",
    "good agreement was found for the hetg and acis  derived temperatures for about half of the knots .",
    "the outliers are well described by a plasma far from collisional ionization equilibrium , the state which is assumed for the hetg line - ratio temperature estimates .",
    "the low @xmath7 values and the high electron densities derived from this analysis predict a significant amount of plasma evolution in the 10-year baseline , in stark contrast with the observations . we propose a physical model of two plasmas ",
    "one high metallicity , one low metallicity  that remain unmixed at small spatial scales .",
    "the si emission comes from the pure heavy metal ejecta ( ne through fe ) , while the continuum is provided by the low density component , rich in the elements c , n , and o. this model fits the data well and explains the lack of evolution , since it requires a much lower electron density for the si plasma and , therefore , a longer timescale for evolution .",
    "if validated , this model could place strong constraints on turbulence in supernova explosion models .",

    "in general , extended sources can not effectually be observed with slitless dispersive spectrometers such as the gratings on _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton_. however , for cases like the thermal knots of cas  a , their small size and bright line emission allow line information to be extracted from the dispersed data@xcite .",
    "on ccd - readout instruments , the dispersed images ( figure[fig : displocs ] ) carry useful information not only in the direction of dispersion , but also in the cross - dispersion axis , as well as in energy , which can provide order sorting .",

    "the software is an example of x - ray analysis that goes beyond the usual 1d fitting approach@xcite .",
    "event-2d removes the need to define a filament , allows different spectral models to be assigned to the knot and its surroundings , and , through its instrument simulation , utilizes a narrow order - sorting range to reduce background .",
    "spectral extraction consists of generating the usual spectral products ( ` pha ` , ` arf ` , and ` rmf `  files ) for a source observed with the hetg .",
    "the standard extraction process also adds grating - specific data ( columns ) to the ` evt2 `  file based on the location of the source center .",
    "these values include an event s assigned diffraction order and 2-dimensional grating coordinates , tg_r and tg_d .",
    "( note that many events will not be part of an extraction for a given source location ; these events are flagged by a diffraction order set to 99 . )",
    "it is this ` evt2 `  file that event-2d uses as input data in place of the ` pha `  file . because of this ,",

    "the extractions for the cas a knots were carried out with ciao tools using standard hetg - appropriate steps . for convenience , scripts from tgcat",

    "the location for the extraction of each knot was manually set by comparing the regions of acis epoch 2004.4 with the hetg zeroth - order image to effectively select the same knot .",
    "we made some adjustments to the usual extraction parameters to improve the subsequent 2d analyses : ( 1 ) the cross - dispersion width was set to twice the knot diameter , ( 2 ) a large zeroth - order radius of 60 arcseconds was defined , ( 3 ) a narrow order - sorting range of @xmath2340.06 was set , and ( 4 ) ` arf `  files were made for orders @xmath235 .",
    "the large zeroth - order range was chosen to include ( and hence model ) off - knot spatial features that can produce spatial - spectral overlap with the knot .",
    "the narrow order sorting range still includes most of the si - range flux while helping to reduce cross - talk from other spatial regions .",
    "the spatial model of each knot is self - described using the zeroth - order events within a given radius of the extraction center .",
    "the events surrounding the knot region are used to define a second spatial component of the model  see figure  [ fig : zocomponents ] .",
    "modeling this surrounding region is an important part of generating simulated dispersed events in the wavelength range of interest .",
    "spectral models are assigned to the two spatial components .",
    "the knot spectrum is described by 4 gaussians corresponding to the he - like @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 lines and the h - like ly@xmath14 line .",
    "the @xmath15 ratio is fixed at the low density value of 2.45 and the remaining free parameters are then the overall flux , the f / r ratio , the h / he ratio and a common doppler shift . for the surroundings spectrum",
    "we start with the best - fit acis ( epoch 2004.4 ) ` vnei `  model and allow its @xmath7 to be adjusted . this can give a reasonable approximation of the surroundings , especially for the closest features that are most important .",
    "( of course one could explicitly measure and use the spectrum of the surrounding region itself , perhaps even in multiple zones .",
    "however , we have not seen a clear need for this level of model fidelity in the analyses so far . ) because we are not very sensitive to the continuum shape , the temperature is held fixed .",
    "although it need not be , the velocity of the surroundings is fixed at the knot velocity ; we have not seen a clear indication in the data for a need to change this .",
    "the `` source-3d '' routines ( companion to event-2d ) are used to organize and access the spatial - spectral model described above . in particular monte carlo source events",
    "can be generated from the defined model and then passed through an approximate hetg instrument simulator in event-2d . in this way",
    "simulated model data are created that can be compared with the actual data ( figure[fig:2ddatamodel ] ) .",

    "note how the apparent angle of the knot differs between orders .",
    "[ fig:2ddatamodel ] ]    parameter estimation proceeds by forward - folding the spatial - spectral model to generate model events , which are then compared to the spectra .",
    "the data and model events are binned in defined 2d histograms , and the chi - squared statistic is calculated : @xmath236 , where @xmath237 .",
    "this modified definition of @xmath238 reduces the bias in the statistic compared to either @xmath239 or @xmath240 .",
    "the randomized nature of the model generation forces us to use noise - tolerant fitting algorithms .",
    "a small change in a parameter value can be masked by the `` model noise '' of monte carlo samples ( even though the model counts are over - simulated by a factor of 10 ) .",
    "for instance , around the best - fit value of parameter @xmath241 , we have that @xmath242 where @xmath243 is a constant depending on the particular data and model and the @xmath244 term represents the noise in the model computation .",
    "hence changes in @xmath241 are not `` noticeable '' above the model noise unless @xmath245 , effectively setting a minimum scale size for parameter @xmath241 . because of this , we use minimization schemes that include a minimum scale for noticeable changes in a parameter and that are tolerant of the model noise .",
    "for example , to determine a single parameter like the doppler velocity , multiple evaluations of the statistic are performed at each step of 100 @xmath246 to estimate @xmath244 , which aids in determining the best parameter value .",
    "for multi - parameter fitting , a noise - tolerant conjugate - gradient ( c - g ) scheme can be constructed to minimize a parameter in 1d and include the noise level in its convergence diagnostics .",
    "another approach to dealing with noisy models is to use a mcmc method : the noise of the model generation is only a slight addition to the larger variation expected as the parameter space is randomly explored and so the technique is not sensitive to the model noise .    to analyze these x - ray knots ,",
    "we combine the two methods .",
    "the c - g fitting coarsely sets the surrounding region norm and tau values , fixing the tau value .",
    "a 1d scan in velocity space is then performed and the velocity is fixed . a c - g scan",
    "is then done to fit the two line ratios and the ratio of flux from the surrounding region to that of the knot .",
    "mcmc exploration is carried out for these 3 parameters starting from the c - g best - fit values ; in this way there is generally little settling time for the mcmc .",
    "the spread in the mcmc draws provides the error bars for the parameters .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the modeling is sensitive to the ccd gain calibration through the narrow order - sorting range . after a knot s",
    "analysis is complete , the simulated and real ccd energy distributions are compared for the bright he - like si line in each order .",
    "where these differ by more than 0.8% , a custom gain correction is included for that epoch - knot - order ( applied when the data are read in ) and the knot is re - analyzed .",
    "the measured values for a knot are its doppler velocity , the two line ratios ( @xmath16 and he - like / h - like ) , and the overall knot flux normalization ; these are given in table  [ tab : hetgresults ] for both epochs of hetg observations .",
    "uncertainties are given for all but the flux , which has a statistical uncertainty generally less than 2% and so will be dominated by systematic errors , e.g. , calibration of the effective area at a knot s specific location .",
    "in this appendix we provide the details of the data reduction and analysis of the acis data .",
    "the observation ids and exposure times are listed in table  [ tab : acisobs ] , section  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "the acis analysis used four archival datasets from early 2000 , mid-2004 , late 2007 , and late 2009 .",
    "all four of these observations were taken on the back illuminated acis - s3 chip in graded data mode .",
    "they were targeted at a right ascension of @xmath247 and a declination of @xmath248 .",
    "we assumed these small , bright knots are individual clumps of similar material , so we therefore defined their boundaries spectrally .",
    "once defined , all of the enclosed material shares the same spectral features . arbitrarily bounding these regions by hand , using only brightness information and an analyst s intuition ,",
    "could unintentionally include non - knot material of similar surface brightness , thereby skewing results of the analysis .",
    "we found this to be the case , so developed a more systematic method than hand - selection .",
    "our region - determining algorithm finds the radius at which nearby material starts to contaminate the knot . for each knot",
    "we select an inner region consisting of the brightest central pixels  typically 4 to 6 in number ; this region defines the spectrum of the knot .",
    "we then compare this spectrum to the spectra of annuli of increasing radius ( figure  [ fig : regsearch ] ) , evaluating the poisson likelihood of the annulus data , given the central region s spectrum as the model .",
    "the knot boundary is defined at the annulus where the likelihood drops sharply , or where the normalized counts per unit area drop abruptly . in the absence of sharp changes",
    ", we visually compared the spectra to delineate the boundary .",
    "the bright x - ray knots are expanding amidst a diffuse web of emitting material .",
    "we must therefore carefully consider how to define the `` background '' ( which could very well be the foreground ) for spectral modeling , as the knot is seen _ through _ this web .",
    "we systematically examined the characteristics of the surrounding material to determine the most faithful way to define the background for each knot .",
    "we decided to assign multiple diffuse , nearby regions as the background for each knot .",
    "figure  [ fig : knotbkgd ] shows a typical background assignment .",
    "these diffuse regions were characterized by low surface brightness ( over the _ chandra _  passband ) and variations over larger angular scales .",
    "we typically chose several regions for each knot for two reasons .",
    "first , these regions were more spectrally consistent ( and therefore yielded similar plasma parameters for the knot model ) than background regions that contained brighter features varying on smaller angular scales .",
    "second , since this diffuse material varied on longer scales , it was more probable that it contaminated the knot spectrum .",
    "choosing multiple regions around the knot effectively interpolated the spectrum to the position of the knot .",
    "the regions remained the same across epochs , save for slight nudging required because of the ejecta expansion .",
    "the background regions were chosen near to the knots but not directly adjacent .",
    "we considered using the discarded non - knot annuli from the region - determining algorithm .",
    "however , the material in these adjacent rings showed spectral features not present in the knot on order of the same surface brightness , suggesting different compositions .    in general",
    ", we find that the diffuse material we select as backgrounds tends to be cooler and to move more slowly than the ejecta knots . including background spectra in the model generally results in higher derived plasma temperatures and doppler velocities for the knots .",
    "the development of this algorithm yielded a unique image extraction technique .",
    "for an extended source like cas  a , the ` specextract `  ciao  script is typically used .",
    "the area - weighted ` arf `  ( ` warf ` ) created by ` specextract `  does not include the effect of angular dither , since the region area is assumed to be large compared to the dither .",
    "the annuli usually have a size of 6 - 15 pixels , large enough to warrant a ` warf `  and ` wrmf ` , yet small enough to be affected by the dither of the instrument  .",
    "to create , then , a ` warf `  that includes dither , we first make the ` pi ` file and ` wrmf `  with ` specextract ` .",
    "running the ` sky2tdet ` function outputs a ` wmap ` file describing the dither , which can then be used a second time in ` mkwarf ` , rewriting the ` warf ` .",
    "the tweaked calibration product is now appropriate to our peculiarly sized regions .",
    "this extraction was done using ciao version 4.3 , with caldb version 3.2.2 .",
    "we applied a non - equilibrium ionization model with variable abundances ( ` vnei `  version 2.0 ) to the data , also accounting for interstellar absorption ( ` phabs ` ) and pileup @xcite .",
    "we chose not to employ the similar ` vpshock ` model due to the additional free parameter of the lower @xmath7 value .",
    "subsequent investigations on several knots yielded maximum likelihood ` vpshock ` values of @xmath7 and @xmath60 within 10% of those for the ` vnei `  model , where we compared the upper @xmath7 for ` vpshock ` to twice that of the ` vnei `  @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , we do not think our choice of model unduly biased the results .    for each knot",
    ", we expect several physical parameters to stay constant across the decade of observations : the equivalent neutral hydrogen column density and the elemental abundances . to this end",
    "we performed the fits to the four epochs of acis data for each knot simultaneously , while tying @xmath59 and the abundances from the 2004.4 , 2007.9 and 2009.8 datasets to that of the 2000.2 dataset .",
    "values for c , n and o abundances were frozen to 5 times the solar value .",
    "( as discussed in section  [ sec : vneidegen ] , the actual values of the abundances used can be degenerate with the norm of the continuum fit .",
    "we thus chose a value of 5 to account for the expected c , n , and o dominance in the continuum .",
    "@xcite argues for o , while @xcite argues for h / he , or c / n . ) fe and ni abundances were tied together .",
    "for the ` pileup ` component of the model , all parameters but @xmath249the number of regions where pileup occurs  are fixed across epochs : @xmath250 , @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",
    "the @xmath253 and @xmath14 values are simply fiducial estimates for grade - migration processes .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 was set to 1 because all of the knots are larger than chandra s psf . letting",
    "@xmath249 alone vary captured the effects of pileup well , reducing the @xmath254    the redshift parameter in the model was treated only as a calibration gain factor , and it was allowed to differ from epoch to epoch .",
    "redshifts were point - estimated at the beginning of the fitting process , then frozen throughout the confidence contour generation .",
    "this initial point estimate was fit with the he - like @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and h - like ly@xmath14 si lines folded through the acis ` rmf ` . by fixing the redshifts to these maximum likelihood values",
    ", the confidence contour computation time was greatly reduced .",
    "( we attribute the added computational complexity to the discontinuous @xmath81 space along the redshift axis , a persistent feature we found with this model . )",
    "the combined four - epoch fit for each knot involved 88 parameters , with 25 of these free .",
    "with such a complicated parameter space , it was easy for the fit to fall into  and get hung up in  local minima . in order to better find the global minimum for each fit , we used the native , parallelized isis function ` confloop ` .",
    "this function performs confidence limit searches on each parameter individually about the current best fit value , often climbing out of a local minimum to find a better fit .",
    "once the spectral fits have found the maximum likelihood point for each epoch of each knot , we proceed to generate confidence contours for our fit parameters .",
    "a grid is laid down around this best estimate parameter vector and the @xmath255 statistic ( defined below ) is minimized at each point to map out the confidence levels .",
    "the confidence contours are made with ` conf_map_counts ` in isis .",
    "the reported parameter ranges represent confidence levels .",
    "that is , if the analysis could be repeated , the true parameters would lie within the 90% contours for 90% of the re - analyses .",
    "moreover , we only report the bounding edges ( see figure [ fig : ccedges ] ) , even though the confidence contours are never rectangular .",
    "we do this for conciseness and because the contours all have the same anti - correlated `` banana '' shape seen in figure  [ fig : acisresults1 ] .",
    "we make several assumptions to warrant our use of confidence contours for parameter estimation .",
    "we assume the counts in each energy bin are independent from each other and that they are poisson - distributed , with each energy bin @xmath256 having a mean @xmath257 given by the model .",
    "we group counts into energy bins of at least 30 counts , so that we may approximate the count distribution in each bin as normal , with mean @xmath257 and standard deviation @xmath258 .",
    "( our inclusion of pileup both undermines and supports this assumption .",
    "we admit that a count in one bin may originate from two in another , yet since we account for pileup effects , the bins of the model spectra will have less correlation . )",
    "this large minimum number of counts per energy bin allows us to employ the @xmath255 statistic , popularized by cash for nonlinear x - ray models .",
    "( we did not use cash s more appropriate @xmath259 statistic solely because of the extra computation time within the isis framework . ) the @xmath255 statistic is merely 2 times the log likelihood : @xmath260 where @xmath261 are the data counts in each of the @xmath262 bins and , as above , @xmath257 are the predicted model counts .",
    "we are interested in only a subspace of the whole parameter space , primarily the @xmath60s and @xmath7s over the four epochs .",
    "cash s result says that the difference between the minimized values of @xmath255 over this @xmath263-dimensional subspace and the overall best fit @xmath255 follows a @xmath264 distribution .",
    "thus , with probability @xmath265 , the true values of the parameters reside within the contour(s ) where this difference equals @xmath266 .    as a final approximation , during confidence contour generation",
    "we assume that the epochs are independent , despite explicitly tying @xmath267 and elemental abundances between epochs .",
    "that is , for one epoch of one knot , we grid up @xmath60 and @xmath7 values and minimize @xmath255 at those points , with @xmath267 , the abundances , and the @xmath60s and @xmath7s from other epochs free to vary .",
    "we do this merely for computational tractability : under this approximation we only have to minimize @xmath255 on @xmath268 grid points , instead of @xmath269 .",
    "the maximum likelihood parameters for each epoch differed little from the global best parameters , suggesting this assumption is sound .",
    "to calculate @xmath90 , we use a combination of model parameters and inferred values .",
    "parameter estimation with the ` vnei `  model yields the norm , @xmath270 , and the abundances , @xmath271 .",
    "we estimate the knot volume , @xmath272 , as an oblate spheroid , with axes taken from our region - finding algorithm .",
    "we set the distance to cas a to @xmath273 .",
    "we approximate the number of electrons stripped with a functional form : @xmath274 ( the function is constrained to the interval [ 0 , @xmath275 . ) finally , the solar abundances , @xmath276 , are drawn from @xcite ."
