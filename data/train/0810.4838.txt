    "in this section , we first study whether strong galaxy lenses lie preferentially in dense environments , as characterized by a high weak - lensing convergence . then , by comparison with the simulations , we investigate which component of the large structure enhances the strong lensing cross - section .",

    "for the same reason , the convergence measured in the wl mass map can not be accounted for the convergence that directly affects the strong lenses , as what is of matter for strong lensing is the fluctuation that is coherent over the angular scale of the lens ( i.e @xmath171 ) . for each of the three defined convergence regions , table  [ region ]",

    "surprisingly , we thus do not observe any particular correlation between the environment and the frequency of strong lenses .",

    "the lensing simulations may also help to interpret the cosmos observations .",
    "the results of our lensing simulation are summarized in table  [ sim_region ] .",
    "we use the same threshold values for the convergence ( i.e. @xmath650.004 and 0.014 ) in the smoothed convergence maps to divide our simulated lensing fields into low- , intermediate- , and high - convergence regions as for the observed field .",
    "the resulting area fraction covered by the low-(@xmath66 ) , intermediate-(@xmath67 ) , and high - convergence regions ( @xmath68 ) in the simulated fields is very similar to the fractions measured in the cosmos field ( except that the fraction of the simulted survey area with high weak - lensing convergence is somewhat smaller than that in the cosmos field ) .    the galaxy densities @xmath69 of the simulated parent population in the low- and intermediate - convergence regions are slightly smaller than the densities observed in the cosmos field .",

    "we are primarily interested in the relative number of expected strong galaxy - galaxy lenses in the different convergence regimes .",

    "this strong increase is in contrast to the weak increase of the density of strong - lens candidates seen in the cosmos field .",
    "the increased strong - lensing optical depth @xmath48 in regions of higher weak - lensing convergence is partly due to the increased galaxy density @xmath69 of the parent population .",

    "the ratio of cross - sections in the low- and high - convergence region ranges from 2 to 10 .",

    "however , the increasing fraction of strong lenses in regions of increasing convergence expected from the simulations is not matched by the constant fraction of observed strong lenses in the cosmos field .",
    "the discrepancy between the simulations and observations may be due to a number of reasons .",
    "some of the possible reasons related to the observations are :    * the sample of strong lenses might be incomplete in a way that biases the results . *",
    "a significant fraction of the strong - lens candidates are not strong galaxy - galaxy lenses .",
    "* the measured wl mass map does not represent the actual mass distribution in the cosmos field very accurately .",
    "* our arbitrary cuts in wl convergence might not encompass important transitions between low- and high - density regimes .",
    "* the cosmos field might be a peculiar case due to cosmic variance .",
    "* the number of strong lenses might be too low to reach the necessary statistical precision , and therefore we are missing the correlation .",
    "* there may be actually no correlation between the strong lenses and the environment ( at least for the used galaxy sample selection criteria ) .",
    "point  ( i ) can not yet be completely ruled out .",
    "[ lograrc ] ( upper plot ) shows the distribution of arc radii in our strong lenses .",

    "the gap at 1 corresponds suspiciously to the mean seeing size of the ground based imaging .",
    "it is possible that genuine strong lenses were excluded during the transition from monochromatic , space - based images used to detect potential candidates , to ground - based , color images used to verify them .",

    "2008 ) elliptical galaxies , so we are confident that our sample is close to complete . confirming the statistical significance of the apparent lack of lenses with arc radii above 3.5 will require a larger sample .",
    "overall , if the properties of strong lenses were strongly influenced by the environment of the main lensing potential , we would have expected a much smoother transition between systems with a galaxy - like ( r@xmath874 ) and cluster - like ( r@xmath8810 ) mass deflectors , as seen in the simulations ( fig .",

    "the insignificant reconstructed @xmath90-modes ( massey et al .  2007 ) demonstrate the overall reliability of the weak lensing map .",
    "however , isolated imperfections in the analysis ( e.g. imperfect psf modeling in one or two hst / acs pointings ) can go undetected when averaged over the entire field .",
    "such artefacts ( as well as noise ) can manifest as spurious convergence peaks , which would dilute the fraction of strong lenses measured in high density environments .",
    "it is difficult for systematics to _ remove _ real lensing convergence and thus produce the opposite effect ; the much larger area of low density than high density also means that noise acts in the same sense .",
    "this bias doubtless contributes to the observed results , but is not at a sufficient level to explain them alone .",
    "point  ( iv ) can be excluded if the lensing simulations are not terribly unrealistic , since they show a clear change in the strong - lens fraction .",
    "point  ( v ) can also be excluded , the measured scatter between the 20 simulated fields showing that cosmic variance alone is insufficient to explain the discrepancy .",
    "future observations of larger fields will also test this .",
    "they will also be required to test explanations ( vi ) and ( vii ) , which can not be ruled out with existing data .",
    "+ apart from possible reasons related to the observations , the discrepancy may be caused by the simple assumptions and approximations used in the lensing simulations .",
    "these include the assumption of circularly symmetric projected stellar - mass profiles of the lens galaxies ( i.e. lensing cross - section ) , the neglect of the response of their dark - matter halo to baryon cooling ( gnedin et al .  2004 ) , the assumption of point - like sources ( instead of extended elliptical sources ) , and a simple source magnitude distribution ( which neglects any evolution with redshift ) . in principle , we also can not exclude the possibility that the discrepancy is due to shortcomings of the underlying dark - matter structure formation model . moreover , the model for the strong - lens selection function of the cosmos sample that we use in the simulations might be unrealistic .",
    "firstly , the simulated parent population relies on semi - analytic models to predict the galaxy properties ; the number of small galaxies in high - density regions could have been overestimated .",
    "then the detection criteria for strongly distorted images may be too simplistic .",
    "for example , the uniform magnitude detection threshold does not depend on the distance to the lens galaxy ( apart from a cutoff for images closer than @xmath50 ) , or on the lens galaxy s apparent size and brightness . in the real data , faint lensed images at small projected distances from a large and bright lensing galaxy may have been missed .",
    "in addition , there is considerable scatter in the average cross - sections measured in different simulated fields ( see table  [ sim_region ] ) . a different value for the normalization @xmath91 might change the total number of strong lenses , but not their distribution among the different density region .    in summary ,",
    "there remain many questions ( which we intend to address in future work ) before we can firmly conclude whether the observed lack of correlation between strong lenses and their environment is real , or whether predictions from current models are right . in particular",

[ fig : stellar_and_total_mass_plot ] . there are only a few of them , so they do not significantly affect the luminosity distribution of the parent population , but they dominate the lensing statistics .    this result of the simulation is not in contradiction with the observations in the cosmos field : the brightest galaxies do not dominate the population of galaxies in the high - convergence region ( fig .",

    "the large image separations are due to the presence of high mass - to - light ratio galaxies in the dense regions and the strong external shear / convergence generated by the lens - galaxy environment .",

    "the main cause for the higher fraction of strong lens systems with large image separations in high - density regions is an excess of galaxies with high total - to - stellar mass ratio .",
