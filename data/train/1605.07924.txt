    "in 1967 , an outbreak of smallpox occurred in the nigerian town of abakaliki .",
    "the vast majority of cases were members of the faith tabernacle church ( ftc ) , a religious organisation whose members refused vaccination . a world health organization ( who ) report @xcite describes the outbreak , with information on not only the time series of case detections but also their place of dwelling ( compound ) , vaccination status , and ftc membership .",
    "the outbreak has inherent historical interest as it occurred during the who smallpox eradication programme initiated in 1959 . although smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980 , it regained attention as a potential bioterrorism weapon in the early 2000s ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) and continues to be of interest due to concerns about its re - emergence or synthesis ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) . public health planning for potential future smallpox outbreaks requires estimates of the parameters governing disease transmission , and thus being able to accurately obtain such quantities from available data is of considerable importance .    within mathematical infectious disease modelling ,",
    "the abakaliki smallpox data set has been frequently cited , the first appearance being @xcite .",
    "the data are almost always used to illustrate new data analysis methodology , but in virtually all cases most aspects of the data are ignored apart from the population of 120 ftc individuals and the case detection times , while the models used are not particularly appropriate for smallpox ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite use a more realistic smallpox model and take account of the compounds where individuals lived , but again ignore all non - ftc individuals .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to present a bayesian analysis of the full data set . to our knowledge ,",
    "the only previous analysis of the full abakaliki data is in @xcite , where the authors define a stochastic individual - based transmission model that considers not only the case detection times but also the other aspects of the data .",
    "their model takes account of the population structure , the disease progression for smallpox , the vaccination status of individuals and the introduction of control measures during the outbreak .",
    "the model parameters are then estimated by constructing and maximising a likelihood function which is itself constructed using various approximations . specifically , the true likelihood of the observed data given the model parameters is practically intractable , since it involves integrating over all possible unobserved events , such as the times at which individuals become infected .",
    "eichner and dietz tackle this problem by first using a back - calculation method to approximate the distribution of unobserved event times for a given individual , and then by making various assumptions about independence between individuals in order to construct an approximate likelihood function .",
    "an alternative solution to the intractable likelihood problem is to use data - augmentation methods to produce an analytically tractable ( and correct ) likelihood , which can then be incorporated in a bayesian estimation framework by using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods along the lines described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we adopt this approach to carry out a full bayesian analysis of the abakaliki smallpox data , whilst also assessing how well the eichner and dietz approximation method works in this setting .",
    "our approach provides results which can be directly compared with those of eichner and dietz , specifically estimates of model parameters , estimates of associated quantities of interest such as reproduction numbers , and the sensitivity of the results to the disease progression assumptions .",
    "in addition , we also estimate quantities derived via data - augmentation , such as who - infected - whom and the time of infection for each individual , carry out various forms of model assessment to see how well the model fits the data , and explore particular aspects of the model via simulation .",
    "none of these additional elements feature in the eichner and dietz analysis .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the data , stochastic transmission model and method of inference .",
    "section 3 contains results and details of sensitivity analysis and model - checking procedures .",
    "we finish with discussion in section 4 .",
    "the supplementary material contains details of some likelihood calculations and the mcmc algorithm .",
    "the outbreak is described in detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there were 32 cases in total , 30 of which were ftc members .",
    "all of the infected individuals lived in compounds , which were typically one - storey dwellings built around a central courtyard , and capable of housing several families .",
    "the ftc members frequently visited one another and were somewhat isolated from the rest of the community , which is one reason why most previous data analyses only consider ftc members .",
    "although ftc members refused vaccination , many of them had been vaccinated prior to joining ftc as described below .",
    "table [ abakaliki ] contains details of the 32 cases of smallpox recorded during the outbreak , specifying the date of onset of rash , compound identifier , ftc membership status and vaccination status .",
    "note that we set a timescale by setting day zero of the outbreak to be the first onset of rash date .",
    "the composition of the affected compounds is provided in table [ compounds ] , where the total numbers of vaccinated and non - vaccinated ftc and non - ftc members within each compound are listed .",
    "note that on day 25 , four ftc individuals from compound 1 ( three vaccinated and one non - vaccinated ) moved to compound 2 .",
    "in addition , quarantine measures were put in place in abakaliki , but not until part way through the outbreak . the exact time these measures were introduced was not recorded .",
    ".smallpox cases in abakaliki , nigeria during 1967 , taken from @xcite .",
    "compounds listed are those before the move of cases 7 and 8 , and 2 other uninfected individuals , on day 25 from compound 1 to compound 2 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]          since the mcmc algorithm involves imputation of all event times , it is straightforward to obtain estimates of the path of infection , i.e. who infected whom .",
    "specifically , if an individual @xmath0 is subject to infectious pressure @xmath1 at the time of their exposure , where @xmath2 is the pressure from the @xmath3th of @xmath4 infectives at time @xmath5 , then the probability that individual @xmath3 actually infected @xmath0 is simply @xmath6 .",
    "figure [ whoinfwhom ] shows the most likely infector for each observed case and also a greyscale plot which illustrates the associated uncertainty .",
    "we see that most infections occurred within compounds ; note that individuals 7 and 8 moved from compound 1 to compound 2 during the outbreak and so in reality most of the infections caused by individual 8 were probably also within - compound .",
    "most individuals give rise to one secondary case , but individuals 0 and 8 both cause multiple secondary cases .",
    "the greyscale plot shows that there is a modest degree of uncertainty around the identity of each infector .",
    "figure [ exposure ] illustrates the posterior distribution of the initial exposure time for each of the 32 cases .",
    "generally speaking there is relatively little uncertainty , and most of the exposure times follow the ordering of the rash times , both features that are likely to be consequences of the distributions assumed for disease progression .",
    "the figure also shows the temporal aspects of the outbreak in terms of generations of infection : the first two generations ( i.e. those infected by the index case , and those they infect ) are clearly discernible , while the third and fourth generations are less distinct from each other , although ( according to figure [ whoinfwhom ] ) the fourth generation only contains two individuals .",
    "we see some groups of individuals with very similar exposure times and who are all infected by the same person , according to figure [ whoinfwhom ] , individuals 4 , 5 , 6 and 10 , 11 , 12 being two examples . such clustering , more akin to a point - source outbreak , illustrates the high transmission potential for smallpox in close - contact settings .",
    "finally , we comment that @xcite also provide a plot showing likely exposure times , along with other event times , but that this is based entirely on back - calculation using the assumed disease progression model . in particular , their plot takes no account of the transmission model itself .",
    "we now briefly explore the sensitivity of our results to the underlying model assumptions , and in particular the assumed values for the periods of time spent in each disease state .",
    "figure [ fig : sdensity ] displays posterior densities for the parameters of interest over a range of values taken from @xcite and @xcite . as might be expected , when @xmath7 , the mean length of the rash period before removal , is reduced to make shorter average infectious periods , the estimates of the infection rate parameters increase to compensate .",
    "it is of interest to note that estimation of @xmath8 is somewhat sensitive to the choice of @xmath7 .",
    "this is likely to be an artefact of the fact that that there are relatively few cases , the population structure and the introduction of control measures , since in a large uninterrupted outbreak we would expect @xmath8 to be more or less determined by the outbreak size .",
    "figure [ fig : gdensity ] shows the effect of varying @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the parameters which govern the time taken for a case to be quarantined .",
    "specifically , we consider the effect of halving or doubling the mean time , while keeping the coefficient of variation fixed at unity . here",
    "we see relatively little impact , which is reassuring since we have very little information on which to base our modelling assumptions , in contrast to those which depend on more generic features of smallpox .      in order to assess",
    "how well our model fits the data we use its posterior predictive distribution .",
    "specifically , we take samples of the basic model parameters from the mcmc output and simulate the model forwards in time for each set of parameter values .",
    "we then compare various aspects of the observed data to the ensemble of simulations to see if the former aligns in some sense with the latter .",
    "we start with the final size of the epidemic , i.e. the total number of cases .",
    "figure [ fig : finalsize ] shows that although the observed final size ( 32 ) is not untypical of those produced by the model , it is some way from the mean ( 23.5 ) and mode of the distribution .",
    "this underestimation appears to be largely due to the fact that in the actual outbreak , four individuals , of whom two were infected , moved from compound 1 to compound 2 , leading to new cases in compound 2 . to account for this ,",
    "figure [ fig : finalsize ] also shows a histogram of the final size distribution among those simulated epidemics in which at least one of the four moving individuals was infected .",
    "it can be seen that this adjustment gives a better fit to the observed final size .",
    "we next consider epidemic duration , defined as the length of time between the first case detection ( rash ) time and the last .",
    "figure [ fig : duration ] shows a histogram of the durations of 5000 simulated outbreaks .",
    "the mean duration is 76.8 days , which is very similar to the abakaliki outbreak ( 76 days ) . including only those outbreaks in which infected individuals moved compound only increases the mean by a few days .",
    "we next compare the simulated cumulative number of cases with the abakaliki data .",
    "this is complicated by the fact that different simulated outbreaks usually have different total numbers of cases , and so to facilitate the comparison we consider only simulated outbreaks that have the same total number of cases ( 32 ) as the data .",
    "figure [ fig : incidence ] shows the results of 1000 simulations , from which it appears that the observed data are reasonably well captured by the model behaviour . to quantify this",
    "more precisely , we calculated a posterior predictive p - value as follows .",
    "recall the chi - squared discrepancy measure ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which here takes the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the model parameters and @xmath13 denotes a vector of case - detection ( rash ) times .",
    "note that neither the mean nor variance term are available analytically , and so in practice they are obtained via simulation : given @xmath12 , we simulate epidemics repeatedly until we have a sample of size @xmath14 , all with 32 cases .",
    "the mean and variance of the @xmath0th rash time is then estimated directly from this sample .",
    "suppose now that we have @xmath15 samples from the posterior density of the model parameters , labelled @xmath16 .",
    "we use the @xmath17th sample to obtain a simulated epidemic with 32 cases and rash times @xmath18 by repeatedly simulating epidemics until we obtain one with 32 cases . denoting a typical simulation replicate @xmath19 and letting @xmath20 denote the observed rash times , the posterior predictive p - value is defined as @xmath21    to interpret this quantity , note that if typical simulations are close to the observed data then we would expect the ppp - value to be around 0.5 , while values close to 0 or 1 would indicate a poor model fit .",
    "we carried out this procedure with @xmath22 and obtained a value of 0.42 , which is suggestive of a good model fit .",
    "a more accurate value could in principle be obtained using larger values of @xmath15 and @xmath14 , but the procedure is highly time - consuming in practice due to the fact that we require simulated epidemics of a given final size .        as a final assessment of model fit , from 5000 simulations we found that on average 91% of those infected were ftc members ,",
    "compared with 94% in the data , although we also found that around 20% of those infected were from outside the compounds , compared to no such individuals in the data .",
    "_ transmission _ the posterior estimates of the basic model parameters indicate clearly that the dominant mode of transmission was within - compound between individuals of the same confession . our estimates of who - infected - whom align with this ; for instance , from figure [ whoinfwhom ] , the vast majority of transmission events occurred within a compound in the most - likely infection pathway .",
    "the epidemiological investigation reported in @xcite found that spread within compounds , and within families in particular , appeared to drive the epidemic and that membership of ftc itself was not the primary transmission route .",
    "this is in agreement with our findings . as in @xcite",
    ", we found that infectiousness is markedly less during the fever period than the rash period , although our mean estimate of the reduction parameter @xmath23 is larger than their maximum likelihood value , which is most likely due to the skewed shape of the marginal posterior density .",
    "_ reproduction numbers _ our posterior mean estimate of @xmath8 is close to 8 .",
    "this is slightly larger than the eichner and dietz estimate ( 6.87 ) but underlines the potentially devastating nature of smallpox .",
    "such values are radically different from those obtained using simpler models : for instance , assuming an sir model in a homogeneously - mixing population of 120 ftc individuals typically results in @xmath8 estimates slightly larger than one , even allowing for the infection rate to vary with time ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this highlights the importance of models which properly take population structure into account .",
    "as previously stated , @xmath8 can be interpreted as the average number of secondary cases produced by a single infective individual in a large susceptible population . for the abakaliki data ,",
    "such an interpretation is hard to apply directly since the compounds , wherein most transmission occurs , are small enough to provide a rapid saturation effect via the depletion of available susceptible individuals .",
    "_ model adequacy _ our model appears to fit the data reasonably well , with the possible caveat that the model invariably predicts cases occurring outside of the compounds .",
    "the fact that the entire population of abakaliki is rather unrealistically modelled as a homogeneously mixing population goes some way to explaining this ; in particular , the potential for contacts between those inside and outside the compounds , and especially between ftc members and those outside the compounds , could well have been rather less than that assumed in the model . according to @xcite",
    ", the ftc community was largely isolated from the community at large , although several of its adult members were involved in trading activities in and around abakaliki .",
    "consequently , a model in which some fraction of ftc members had contact with the outside community might be more realistic , although there are no data to directly inform this .",
    "another aspect that is missing from our model is that of age categories ; @xcite state that the highest attack rates were among children .",
    "however , there do not appear to be sufficient data on compound composition to accurately incorporate age categories , and it seems likely that a model with age - specific transmission rates may be over - parameterised .    _ control measures and the end of the outbreak _ it seems likely that the advent of control measures at time @xmath24 played a crucial role in bringing the outbreak to its conclusion rapdily . under the model assumptions , control measures",
    "reduce the rash period from an average of 16 days to just 2 days , which in turn reduces the number of new infections .",
    "interestingly , the posterior mean of @xmath8 after @xmath24 ( i.e. @xmath8 with @xmath25 ) is around 1.5 , but this in itself is insufficient to permit further large - scale spread due to the depletion of susceptibles within the compounds , and the fact that the epidemic in the population outside the compounds is sub - critical ( i.e. the basic reproduction number is less than 1 ) . expanding the latter point , if we define pre- and post - control measure reproduction numbers for spread within compounds , ftc and the wider population ( e.g. @xmath26 , etc . ) , then posterior mean estimates show that ( i ) within compounds , the epidemic is super - critical before and after @xmath24 ; ( ii ) with the ftc community , the epidemic switches from super- to sub - critical ; ( iii ) in the wider population , the epidemic is always sub - critical . despite this , increasing the value of @xmath24 in simulations was found to increase the outbreak size ; for instance , setting @xmath24 to be 50 , 100 and 200 gave mean outbreak sizes of around 24 , 44 and 64 , respectively .",
    "however , with no restrictions , we found the average outbreak size to be around 86 , which underlines the fact that the epidemic was sub - critical in the wider population .",
    "_ accuracy of the eichner and dietz likelihood approximation _",
    "it is of interest to see that our results are fairly similar to those obtained by @xcite .",
    "the most plausible explanation for this is the fact that distributions used for the length of time in each disease stage do not have particularly large variances , which in turn means that the model is not all that different to one in which all event times are assumed known .",
    "for such a model , the approximation method used by eichner and dietz gives the true likelihood , essentially because the distributions used to approximate uncertain event times collapse to point masses around the true values .",
    "a further point of interest is that the eichner and dietz approximation produces a likelihood function which is numerically but not analytically tractable , specifically because it involves integrals that must be evaluated numerically .",
    "although this is sufficient for optimization purposes such as maximum likelihood , in practice such likelihood functions can be computationally prohibitive for use within mcmc algorithms since they must be repeatedly evaluated .",
    "it would therefore be of interest to develop analytically tractable approximate likelihood functions .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank martin eichner for helpful discussions about this work .",
