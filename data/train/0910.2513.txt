    "the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) are the sound oscillations of the primeval baryon - photon fluid prior to the recombination epoch .",
    "the bao signature imprinted in the matter power spectrum is very useful for the study of the dark energy , hypothetically introduced to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite , because the characteristic scale of the bao plays a role of a standard ruler in the universe @xcite .",
    "the bao signature in the galaxy clustering is clearly detected @xcite , and the constraints on the equation of state parameter of the dark energy are demonstrated @xcite .",
    "future large surveys for the precise measurement of the bao are in progress or planned , providing us an important tool to explore the origin of the accelerated expansion of the universe .    besides the measurement of the bao , those future surveys provide us other important information .",
    "for example , the redshift - space distortions will be measured precisely at the same time .",
    "the redshift - space distortions reflect the velocity of galaxies in the direction of the line of sight .",
    "especially , the linear redshift - space distortion due to the kaiser effect comes from the linear velocity field of matter perturbations , whose measurement will give us a chance to test the gravity theory on the cosmological scales @xcite .",
    "this is important because several modified gravity models are proposed to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe as an alternative to the dark energy .",
    "thus the measurement of the redshift - space distortion , which is useful to constrain the growth rate and the growth factor of the cosmic structure , is also important .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is pointed out that the precise measurement of the bao may also be useful to constrain the growth factor .",
    "the bao signature observed in the galaxy power spectrum is contaminated by the nonlinear effects of the density perturbations , redshift - space distortions and the clustering bias .",
    "the effects of the nonlinearity and the redshift - space distortions cause the damping of the bao signature compared with the case when these effects are switched off .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite found that the damping of the bao depends on the amplitude of the matter power spectrum and that a measurement of the bao damping might be useful to constrain the growth factor of the cosmic structure .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , two of the authors of the present paper reported a detection of the bao damping using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) sample of the data release ( dr ) 6 .",
    "since the observed galaxy power spectrum is contaminated by errors , and is noisy , the procedure of extracting the bao signature from a galaxy power spectrum is a subtle problem . in the previous paper  @xcite",
    ", the cubic spline method was used to construct a smooth power spectrum to extract the bao signature . however , this method is very sensitive to parameters of the cubic spline , i.e. , number and interval of the nodes . due to those reasons ,",
    "it is clear that an independent cross check of the previous result is useful .    in the present paper ,",
    "we adopt an independent method to construct the smooth power spectrum , which is stable compared with the cubic spline method , and re - investigate the bao damping by confronting the model predictions with the sdss lrg power spectrum of the dr7 .",
    "we confirm the detection of the bao damping at the one sigma level .",
    "also we obtain a constraint on the parameter combination @xmath6 at the redshift @xmath7 from the bao damping for the first time . here",
    "@xmath4 is the growth factor and @xmath2 is the amplitude of the root mean square overdensity in a sphere of radius @xmath3mpc .",
    "we denote the growth rate by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the scale factor . throughout this paper",
    ", we use units in which the velocity of light equals 1 and the hubble parameter @xmath10km / s / mpc with @xmath11 .",
    "the bao signature in the power spectrum @xmath12 can be obtained by @xmath13 where @xmath14 represents the smooth power spectrum corresponding to @xmath12 . since the definition of @xmath14 is not unique , the construction of @xmath14 should be carefully done .",
    "the cubic spline method is frequently used @xcite , but it is not always stable if dealing with a noisy power spectrum from observations .    in the present paper ,",
    "we construct the smooth power spectrum as the linear matter power spectrum multiplied by a simple analytic function of the wave number . with the use of the constructed smooth power spectrum",
    ", we obtain the bao signature from the sdss lrg power spectrum of the dr7 @xcite . the extracted bao signature",
    "is then compared with theoretical predictions , particularly focusing on the bao damping .",
    "we use the sdss lrg sample from dr 7 ( see also @xcite for recent results on lrgs from the sdss dr7 ) .",
    "our lrg sample is restricted to the redshift range @xmath15 . in order to reduce the sidelobes of the survey window",
    "we remove some noncontiguous parts of the sample ( e.g. three southern slices ) , which leads us to @xmath16 deg@xmath17 sky coverage with a total of @xmath18 lrgs .",
    "the data reduction procedure is the same as that described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this power spectrum analysis",
    ", we adopted the spatially flat lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath19cdm ) model distance - redshift relation @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "figure [ fig - pow ] shows the observed power spectrum @xmath21 .",
    "the observed power spectrum is contaminated by various effects : the nonlinear effect , redshift - space distortions , clustering bias , and so on .",
    "in particular , the modeling of the clustering bias seems to be very difficult , because it depends on the galaxy formation process . in the present paper , in order to construct the smooth power spectrum corresponding to the observed power spectrum , we assume @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the linear no - wiggle power spectrum of @xcite . the solid curve and the dashed curve in fig .",

    "we consider the following 3 cases ,    case 1 : :    we assume @xmath31 and determine a , b and c by    minimising ( [ bias ] ) with @xmath32 ,    @xmath33 ( corresponding to no - damping model ) .",

    "the cosmological parameters are the same as those of fig .",
    "[ fig - pow ] .    here",
    "we note the effect of the window function , which we take into account in our investigation .",
    "this is the finite volume effect of the region where galaxies are distributed , depending on the data analysis as well .",
    "the effect of the window function affects the shape of the bao signature , which is not negligible in our investigation .",
    "the details are described in the literature @xcite .",
    "fig.[window ] shows the ratio of the power spectrum convolved with the window function to that without it .",
    "in our theoretical modeling , we adopt the quasi - nonlinear power spectrum using the technique of resuming infinite series of higher order perturbations on the basis of the lagrangian perturbation theory ( lpt ) , which was proposed by matsubara @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of using this lpt formalism is that the redshift - space distortions can be taken into account .",
    "furthermore , the predicted bao signature was compared with the results of n - body simulations in  @xcite , where a good agreement was obtained .",
    "we denote the matter power spectrum in the redshift - space by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the cosine of the angle between the line of sight direction and the wave number vector .",
    "however , the observed power spectrum in the previous section is the angular averaged power spectrum , which is related to @xmath38 via @xmath40 then , the bao signature is written as @xmath41 the bao damping is described by the function @xmath30 , which is defined by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the bao in the linear theory defined by eq .",
    "( [ defblin ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath43 does not depend on the redshift @xmath5 because the growth factor in the linear power spectrum cancels .",
    "we may define the angular dependent damping factor @xmath44 by @xmath45 which leads to @xmath46    following the lpt framework @xcite , the matter power spectrum in the redshift - space is a function of @xmath39 and the redshift @xmath5 , which we denote by @xmath47 . to calculate",
    "@xmath47 one needs the linear matter power spectrum in redshift space , which depends on @xmath48 , the growth factor multiplied by the normalization factor , and the growth rate @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the scale factor .",
    "the full expression for @xmath47 , which is rather complicated , can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the previous work @xcite",
    ", it was found that the angular dependent damping function at the redshift @xmath5 is approximately given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the function to describe the higher order corrections in the lpt framework , which is given in appendix b of ref .",
    "@xcite , but note that the tilde means the quantity with the no - wiggle linear power spectrum .    in the present paper",
    ", we adopt @xmath54 as the theoretical damping function @xmath30 to be compared with observations . here",
    "@xmath7 is a mean redshift of the lrg sample . also , the angular averaged damping function defined by eq .",
    "( [ ave - corr ] ) is well approximated by @xmath54 , which is demonstrated in figure [ fig - corr ] .",
    "the solid curve is the angular averaged damping function eq .",
    "( [ ave - corr ] ) , the dotted curve is @xmath54 .    in summary ,",
    "the damping function @xmath30 depends on the linear matter power spectrum and the growth rate @xmath55 at the mean redshift @xmath7 . then , by comparing the bao damping with observations , we can hope to constrain @xmath48 and @xmath55 .",
    "we compare the observational result and the theory by calculating the chi - square defined by eq .",
    "( [ bias ] ) with the function @xmath26 determined by the methods in section 2 . in our analysis",
    ", we treat @xmath56 and @xmath57 as independent variables which have nothing to do with the cosmological parameters .",
