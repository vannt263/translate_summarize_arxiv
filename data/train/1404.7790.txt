    "achieving a deep understanding of the phenomenon of quark energy loss in the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is of crucial importance for the correct interpretation of data on hadron suppression at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , as well as for gaining insight on the thermalization process of matter created in these experimental facilities @xcite .",
    "quark energy loss can occur due to gluon radiation or ( hard or soft ) collisions . for low energy heavy quarks ,",
    "the dominant energy loss mechanism is the collision of the heavy quark with the constituents of the qgp ( see , for example , refs .",
    "we calculate the collisional energy loss of a heavy quark traversing the qgp including the effects of a finite relaxation time @xmath0 on the energy loss . to our knowledge , this is the first study of collisional energy loss in the qgp including @xmath0 ( see ref .",

    ", we use the qgp polarization tensor that is derived from the effective hydrodynamic formalism developed by two of us in @xcite .",
    "this model , which is constructed from the entropy production variational method @xcite , incorporates the effect of higher order velocity gradients into the hydrodynamic description of the qgp , thus extending the applicability of a macroscopic description to strongly out of equilibrium situations , such as early time dynamics of the plasma or the most peripheral collisions .",
    "we have shown that the model is able to reproduce the results from kinetic theory even in highly non - equilibrium regimes @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a study of the weibel instability based on this model ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ en ] we provide a brief overview of collisional energy loss in the qgp and describe the polarization tensor as obtained from the effective hydrodynamic model . in section [ results ] we present and discuss our results , and in section [ conc ] we conclude .",
    "we will consider an isotropic , non - expanding qgp and compute the collisional energy loss @xmath5 of a charm quark that transverses it ( @xmath6 is the distance traveled by the quark ) .",
    "the soft - collisional energy loss of a fast particle transversing the qgp can be calculated by linearizing wong s equations , see refs .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    "we consider a stable plasma , for which all modes are damped and there are no instabilities .",
    "this means that the energy loss is solely due to landau damping , i.e. @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the frequency and wave vector of the excitation , and @xmath10 is the quark s velocity . the collisional energy loss is then given by @xmath11 _",

    "the dielectric tensor and its components can be written in terms of the polarization tensor using the equations [ dielectrico]-[proydielt ]",

    "this theory incorporates the effect of higher order velocity gradients into the hydrodynamic description of the qgp , thus extending its applicability to strongly out of equilibrium regimes ( such as early time dynamics , most peripheral collisions and the borders of the fireball ) .",

    "we note that the result for @xmath32 is the same as that obtained from first - order hydrodynamics ( colorless navier - stokes ) that was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , but with an effective shear viscosity @xmath33 given by @xmath34 the appearance of @xmath33 in place of @xmath35 is quite natural since @xmath0 is precisely the relaxation time of the shear tensor @xmath36 towards its navier - stokes value @xcite . in the context of collisional energy loss , a finite value of @xmath0 will imply that if a color excitation is produced in the qgp by the passage of a quark , it will decay slower than if @xmath0 was zero . as we shall see in the next section , this feature has significant effects on the collisional energy loss of quarks crossing the viscous qgp .",
    "the two most widely used models for the relaxation time @xmath0 as an input in hydrodynamic simulations of the qgp are the one derived from boltzmann s equation and the one obtained from the ads / cft correspondence for a strongly - coupled @xmath37=4 supersymmetric yang - mills plasma . for an in - depth discussion of the relaxation time in weakly and strongly - coupled plasmas",
    ", we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "to better understand the impact of a finite relaxation time on quark collisional energy loss , we show results for the energy loss obtained in three cases : @xmath38 , @xmath39 @xcite and @xmath40 @xcite . additionally , as a baseline we have calculated the energy loss in the ideal case , in which @xmath41 and @xmath38 .    in what follows ,",
    "unless otherwise stated we consider a charm quark ( @xmath42 gev ) , the plasma at rest @xmath43 , and fix the temperature to a typical value of @xmath44 gev and the coupling constant to @xmath45 .",
    "figure [ taupis2 ] shows the quark s energy loss as a function of momentum , for ideal and viscous qgp with @xmath46 .",
    "it can be observed that the energy loss is maximum for vanishing viscosity ; the reason for this behavior will be explained later on when presenting our results with varying values of @xmath47 . comparing the ideal and viscous cases , it is seen that the energy loss in the ideal fluid case can be roughly 25@xmath3 larger than the one obtained in the viscous case .",
    "our results are consistent with those of ref .",
    "this shows that the effects of including the viscosity of the medium on the collisional energy loss of fast particles is significant .    from figure [ taupis2 ]",
    ", it can also be seen that the effect of @xmath0 is to increase the energy loss with respect to the @xmath4 case . in the case of the relaxation time",
    "corresponding to ads / cft , @xmath48 , the effect of the relaxation time on the energy loss is very small .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath49 the effect of the relaxation time on the energy loss is appreciable .",
    "it is seen that for a typical 5 fm medium , the difference in the energy loss for different relaxation times can be at most 10 @xmath3 .",
    "the difference between the results for @xmath5 obtained using both models for @xmath0 arise because @xmath49 has an explicit dependence on @xmath47 and with temperature @xmath50 , whereas @xmath48 only depends on @xmath50 . as mentioned above , in this work the temperature",
    "is fixed , so @xmath48 is a constant , but @xmath49 increases with increasing @xmath47 and therefore the @xmath33 corresponding to kinetic theory becomes smaller than the @xmath33 corresponding to ads / cft . as a consequence of this , the energy loss obtained using @xmath48 is smaller than the energy loss obtained using @xmath49 .",
    "figure [ etas ] shows the energy loss as a fuction of @xmath47 , obtained by including or not the time relaxation .",
    "the figure corresponds to a quark moving at @xmath51 .",
    "again one can observe that as the value of @xmath47 increases , the energy loss decreases .",
    "this agrees with the results obtained very recently by jiang et al @xcite . in kinetic theory , the viscosity is @xmath52 @xcite where @xmath53 is the mean value of particle momentum in the medium and @xmath54 is transport cross section . since the temperature is fixed , so is @xmath53 , and therefore when the viscosity increases the cross section decreases , so that the number of collisions with qgp particles decreases , implying less energy loss .",
    "it can be seen from figure [ etas ] that the differences in @xmath5 between the cases with @xmath4 and @xmath48 are rather small throughout the whole range of values for @xmath47 that we consider .",
    "the situation is different for the case including @xmath49 , for which the differences with the @xmath4 case are significant . for @xmath55 , the energy loss calculated by including @xmath49 can be up to 20 @xmath3 larger than the corresponding to @xmath4 , with the difference between both cases rising with increasing values of @xmath47 .",
    "we note that for the range of typical values for @xmath47 at rhic and lhc , namely @xmath56 , the impact of @xmath49 on @xmath5 is at most of 10 @xmath3 .",
    "to better quantify the effect of changing the value of quark velocity @xmath57 has on collisional energy loss , figure [ coc ] shows the ratio of @xmath5 calculated for @xmath58 to @xmath5 calculated for @xmath59 , as a function of @xmath47 .",
    "it is seen that , as expected , a slower quark looses less energy due to collisions than a faster one .",
    "the ratio is @xmath60 , and slightly increases with increasing @xmath47 .    to end up ,",
    "it is interesting to compare the collisional energy loss of a charm quark to that of a bottom quark . figure [ masas ] shows @xmath5 as a function of momentum for both quarks , obtained with @xmath4 , @xmath49 or @xmath48 , with @xmath61 . as expected , the energy loss is larger for the charm quark .",
    "we note that the dependence of @xmath5 on relaxation time is similar in both cases .",
    "we have shown that viscosity effects on the collisional energy loss of heavy quarks through the qgp are important . comparing the ideal and viscous cases for realistic values of @xmath47",
    ", it is seen that the energy loss in the ideal fluid case can be roughly 25@xmath3 larger than the one obtained in the viscous case .",
    "we have also studied the effect of a finite relaxation time @xmath0 on collisional energy loss , and found that the effect is appreciable . in particular , we have compared the two most widely used models for @xmath62 , namely the one derived from kinetic theory and the one derived from the ads / cft correspondence , finding that the effect on energy loss is largest in the former . for realistic values of the shear viscosity to entropy ratio , the difference in energy loss obtained from both models for @xmath0 is roughly 10 @xmath3 .",
    "most importantly , there is a qualitative difference in the way energy loss depends on @xmath47 and quark momentum in one and the other model for @xmath62 .",
    "this opens up the possibility of using energy deposition to discriminate which model best represents the physics of the quark gluon plasma .",
    "last but not least , the effect of @xmath62 on the energy deposition on the plasma has a corresponding effect on the back reaction of the plasma on the traversing quark , and therefore modifies the diffusive propagation of the quark itself @xcite .",
    "this effect could show up in the analysis of such observables as quarkonium suppression @xcite .",
    "of course , a non zero @xmath62 will more generally affect the expansion of the qgp as a whole and therefore its cooling , an effect that also should be taken into account .",
    "we thank jorge noronha for useful comments .",
    "we also thank bing - feng jiang , de - fu hou and jia - rong li for sharing with us their recent work on energy loss in the qgp including viscous corrections .",
