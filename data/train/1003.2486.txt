    "following the development of quantum theory of radiation field , the notion of _ standard coherent states _ ( css ) as the states that are most nearly close to classical description of radiation field , were introduced @xcite .",
    "these states contain important concepts in quantum optics and have numerous applications in different branches of modern physics @xcite .",
    "the standard css of a radiation field are usually constructed using one of the three following manners : i ) they are eigenstates of the standard annihilation operator of the harmonic oscillator , i.e. , @xmath0 , ii ) they can be reproduced by the action of a unitary displacement operator on the vacuum of radiation field , i.e. , @xmath1 .",
    "iii ) they minimize the heisenberg uncertainty relation @xmath2 , with equal variances as the limit of vacuum in both quadratures . in recent years css",
    "have been generalized in various ways .",
    "one of the most important generalization based on algebraic aspects is the notion of _ nonlinear css _",
    "@xcite or _",
    "@xmath3-css _ @xcite . these states defined as the right eigenstates of an @xmath3-deformed annihilation operator @xmath4 , where @xmath3 is an operator - valued function of number operator @xmath5 characterizes the nonlinearity nature of the system",
    ". the nonlinear css approach provides a powerful method for classification and unification of a vast classes of generalized css @xcite .",
    "they are also useful in the construction of css associated to inverse bosonic and @xmath3-deformed annihilation operators @xcite .",
    "a question may naturally arise : is there any displacement operator whose the action on the vacuum state can reproduce nonlinear css ? it is shown that the answer is affirmative .",
    "it is possible to define a _ displacement type _ operator using the auxiliary operators @xmath6 and its conjugate @xmath7 .",
    "indeed it is proved that two different displacement type operators may be constructed . while the action of one of them on the vacuum reproduce the original nonlinear css , the other one produces a new set of nonlinear css @xcite known as the _ dual pair _ with respect to each other @xcite .    on the other side in recent years",
    "much attention has been paid to the _ quantum superposition _ of css @xcite and nonlinear css @xcite due to their interference effects @xcite .",
    "even and odd css @xcite ( even and odd nonlinear css @xcite ) respectively as symmetric and anti - symmetric superposition of css ( nonlinear css ) are along this subject of researches .",
    "generally , interference effects in f - deformed fields were discussed in @xcite .",
    "the generation of non - classical states possessing properties such as sub - poissonian behavior , quadrature squeezing and higher order squeezing is the main motivation of this subject of researches .",
    "as the main goal of the present paper we want to construct the general formalism of superposition of the dual pair corresponding to any nonlinear cs class with known @xmath8 . for this purpose two types of superposition are considered . in the first type we neglect the normalization factors of the dual family of nonlinear css ,",
    "superpose them and then normalize the obtained states . to distinguish this kind of superposition from the second one we call it as `` _ combination _ '' .",
    "it will be easily shown that this combination is a kind of `` superposition of the normalized states '' with different weights , where the weights relate to the normalization factors of the individual states ( see equation ( 11 ) of the paper ) .",
    "but in the second type we superimpose the two `` normalized components '' and then again normalize the resultant states .",
    "it may be recognized that the second type is more customary in the literature .",
    "altogether , some words seem to be necessary about the introduction of the first type .",
    "this combination kind of superposition has been done previously in the literature for different purposes @xcite . the most general case of superposition of two canonical css @xmath9 , @xmath10",
    "is introduced as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are complex numbers restricted by the normalization constraint .",
    "squeezing of these states is investigated by considering @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the annihilation operator @xcite . searching for maximum simultaneous",
    "squeezing and antibunching effects of these states has been done in @xcite .",
    "later , the latter states have been again studied by the same authors in @xcite for investigating the ( maximum ) amplitude squared squeezing of the hermition operator @xmath17 , where @xmath18 operators are defined by @xmath19 ^ 2 $ ] . a rather different motivation for this kind of superposition may outcome from the teleportation scheme .",
    "teleportation of two - mode css studied in @xcite .",
    "the authors considered a particular form of the two - mode css of the form @xmath20 , where @xmath21 are coefficients constrained by the normalization condition .",
    "interestingly , such a particular two - mode css can always be obtained by first the teleportation a single - mode css of the form @xmath22 and then superposing it on a @xmath23 beam - splitter with the vacuum state @xmath24 ( see @xcite and references therein ) . according to our terminology , in all of the latter mentioned cases",
    "the `` combinations of states '' have been considered and studied .",
    "in addition to these , the first type has this mathematical property that can exactly be classified in the `` nonlinear css '' family with a particular nonlinearity function . in what follows a brief review on the @xmath3-css and their dual pairs required for our further manipulations",
    "is presented in section 2 .",
    "some explanations about the resolution of the identity and the domain of the dual family of states are presented in section 3 . then in section 4 the combination of the dual pair are constructed and the nonlinearity signature of the combination of states is established through driving the corresponding nonlinearity function . in section 5",
    "the ( second kind of ) superposition of the dual pair has been introduced .",
    "the non - classical criteria needed for our further discussion will be introduced in section 6 .",
    "section 7 deals with a particular physical realization of the presented formalism by applying to `` hydrogen - like spectrum '' . in section 8",
    "we deal with the gazeau - klauder css ( gkcss ) as the temporally stable css @xcite .",
    "the combination of these states with their dual family will be introduced and their non - classical properties are studied and the nonlinearity signature of the combination of gkcss is established .",
    "a summary of the results is presented in section 9 .",
    "finally , in the appendix some expectation values were required for our numerical calculations can be found .",
    "the nonlinear css method is based on the deformation of standard annihilation and creation operators with an intensity dependent function @xmath8 , according to the relations @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are bosonic annihilation , creation and number operators , respectively .",

    "requiring the over - completeness of any class of css , the dual pair of css should satisfy the resolution of the identity , in addition to the nonorthogonality condition .",

    "in this section we will apply the presented formalism to a generalized css with particular nonlinearity function .",
    "then the previously mentioned non - classical signs of the superposed states will be investigated graphically . for this purpose",

    "secondly , it is noticeable that by considering the formalism introduced by one us in @xcite , we can give hamiltonians describe the dynamics of the systems corresponding to the combined states @xmath182 in ( [ fs ] ) and @xmath169 in ( [ fgk ] ) .",
    "indeed , using ( [ fs ] ) the @xmath3-deformed ladder operators formalism lead one to the hamiltonian @xmath183 , and using ( [ fgk ] ) to @xmath184 .",
    "thirdly , the superpositions in the present paper do not always highlight the non - classical effects , there is special cases in which it weaken the non - classical properties .",
    "this is not surprising if one recalls that the number states are with highest non - classicality and canonical css ( which are particular superposition of the number states ) are with lowest non - classicality ( and highest classicality ) . to this end",
    "we are willing to mention that the presented formalism can be easily extended to any physical system , either with known nonlinearity function or with known discrete non - degenerate spectrum ( center of mass motion of trapped ion , harmonious states , anharmonic oscillator and generally any nonlinear oscillator algebra ) .",
