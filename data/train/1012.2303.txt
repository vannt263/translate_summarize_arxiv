    "the study of halo nuclei is one of the main subjects of research in nuclear physics at present .",
    "many theoretical predictions on halo , superhalo and antihalo nuclei have been advanced in recent years  @xcite .",
    "most of these calculations correspond to nuclei very far from the stability line .",
    "they are mainly thought as a guide for experiments to be performed in coming facilities .",
    "the general feature found in these calculations is that a necessary condition for a nucleus to develop a halo is that the outmost nucleons move in shells which extend far in space .",
    "that is , only a weak barrier keep the system within the nuclear volume .",
    "these shells may be resonances , antibound states ( also called virtual states ) , or even low - spin bound states which lie very close to the continuum threshold .",
    "these conditions are fulfilled by the nucleus @xmath2li and also heavier li isotopes .",
    "there are a number of experiments which have been performed in these very unstable isotopes in order to get information about the structure of halos @xcite .",
    "in particular we will concentrate our attention to refs .",
    "@xcite where the spectrum of @xmath0li was measured .",
    "our aim is to analyze these experimental data by using a suitable formalism to treat unstable nuclei .",
    "this formalism is an extension of the shell model to the complex energy plane and is therefore called complex shell model @xcite , although the name gamow shell model is also used @xcite .",
    "in addition , the correlations induced by the pairing force acting upon particles moving in decaying single - particle states will be taken into account by using the multistep shell model ( msm ) @xcite .",
    "the formalism is presented in section [ form ] .",
    "applications are in section [ appl ] and a summary and conclusions are in section [ sumc ] .",
    "the study of unstable nuclei is a very difficult undertaking since , in principle , time dependent formalisms should be used to describe the motion of a decaying nucleus .",
    "however , the system may be considered stationary if it lives a long time . in this case",
    "the time dependence can be circumvented .",
    "in fact , often unstable nuclei live a very long time and therefore they may be considered bound as , e.g. , in alpha decaying states of many heavy isotopes , like @xmath3bi or @xmath4ta(9@xmath5 ) , with @xmath6 . on the other hand ,",
    "experimental facilities allow one nowadays to measure systems living a very short time . to describe these short time processes one has to consider the decaying character of the system .    of the various theories that have been conceived to analyze unbound systems",
    ", we will apply an extension of the shell model to the complex energy plane  @xcite .",
    "the basic assumption of this theory is that resonances can be described in terms of states lying in the complex energy plane .",
    "the real parts of the corresponding energies are the positions of the resonances while the imaginary parts are minus twice the corresponding widths , as it was proposed by gamow at the beginning of quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "these complex states correspond to solutions of the schrdinger equation with outgoing boundary conditions .",
    "we will not present here the formalism in detail , since this was done many times before , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite . rather , we will give the main points necessary for the presentation of the applications .",
    "in this subsection we will very briefly describe the representation to be used here .",
    "the eigenstates of a central potential obtained as outgoing solutions of the schrdinger equation can be used to express the dirac @xmath7-function as @xcite , @xmath8 where the sum runs over all the bound and antibound states plus the complex states ( resonances ) which lie between the real energy axis and the integration contour @xmath9 .",
    "the wave function of a state @xmath10 in these discrete set is @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the scattering function at energy @xmath13 .",
    "the antibound states are virtual states with negative scattering length .",
    "they are fundamental to describe nuclei in the li region @xcite .",
    "the resonances and the antibound states are poles of the single - particle green function and , therefore , we will call them `` poles '' in order to make a distinction with the scattering states .",
    "this is important since it is through the poles that we will recognize physically meaningful states , i. e. states that live a time long enough .",
    "although meaningful states are usually immersed among continuum states , they can be recognized because their wave functions contain important contributions from the poles , as will be seen in the applications .",
    "discretizing the integral of eq .",
    "( [ eq : delb ] ) one obtains the set of orthonormal vectors @xmath14 forming the berggren representation @xcite .",
    "since this discretization provides an approximate value of the integral , the berggren vectors fulfill the relation @xmath15 , where all states , that is bound , antibound , resonances and discretized scattering states , are included .",
    "the corresponding single - particle wave functions are @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the spin wave function and @xmath18 is the radial wave function fulfilling the berggren metric , according to which the scalar product between two functions consists of one function times the other ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath19    we will apply the berggen representation to analyze the spectrum of @xmath0li by using the multistep shell model method @xcite ( msm ) . in order to make the presentation clear we will give a short description of the main points to be used in this paper .",
    "the berggren representation has been used before within the framework of the cxsm ( or the gamow shell model , which is the same @xcite ) to study li isotopes @xcite .",
    "the core in these calculations was assumed to be @xmath20he and the shell model single - particle states were the shells @xmath21 only .",
    "as pointed out in that reference , the study of many particles moving in states lying in the complex energy plane can be a challenging task .",
    "the main problem is that due to the presence of the scattering states the dimension of the berggren basis soon becomes very large , as well as non - hermitian and complex .",
    "therefore in @xcite one could describe well light li isotopes , up to @xmath22li .",
    "but in heavier isotopes the state @xmath23 ( which is an antibound state ) is of a fundamental importance and its inclusion would make the application of the cxsm a prohibitive undertaking @xcite .",
    "the importance of the antibound state in this nuclear region was known since a rather long time @xcite .",
    "an excellent explanation of the halo nucleus @xmath2li was given in ref .",
    "@xcite by using the continuum shell model , including in the representation only the neutron waves @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which in terms of the cxsm implies to include the antiboud state and the resonances @xmath27 and @xmath28 , but not the state @xmath29 . the corresponding cxsm calculation was indeed performed in refs .",
    "@xcite and , perhaps not surprising , one could thus explain well the structure of @xmath2li as well as the corresponding halo .",
    "one way of avoiding too large dimensions is by including in the basis only physically meaningful states .",
    "these are states which govern the calculated quantities .",
    "for instance , in the evaluation of @xmath30li the single - particle resonance @xmath27 is very broad and its inclusion does not affect the results appreciably @xcite . in this context ,",
    "one important point that has to be emphasized is the evolution of the single - particle states in these isotopes as the continuum threshold is reached . in light li isotopes the unstable character of the unbound states is reflected by the cxsm in that the neutron resonance @xmath27 is very broad and plays practically no role in the evaluation of the spectrum . instead , starting in @xmath22li",
    "this state becomes extremely important and in @xmath2li contributes by about 50% to the formation of the halo @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the state @xmath29 is fundamental in the structure of light li isotopes , but its importance is diminished to a point where it can be neglected starting in @xmath31li .",
    "shell model calculations performed within this approximation reproduced very well the experimental data @xcite . even three - body ( fadeev ) approaches @xcite have shown that the structure of heavy li isotopes are not appreciably affected by the state @xmath29 .",
    "an important conclusion of all the calculations mentioned above is that the low lying states in @xmath2li are essentially two - neutron excitations .",
    "moreover , the corresponding single - neutron states , forming the cxsm representation , are in a similar way extracted from the odd - neutron excitations in @xmath31li @xcite . it is to be noticed that in these references the proton degrees of freedom were also neglected .",
    "the reason for this is that the pairing interaction acting upon the even number of neutrons present in odd li isotopes determines the spectrum , leaving the protons as mere spectators .",
    "however , this can not be said in our case of @xmath0li .",
    "we will therefore include in the calculations the proton shell @xmath29 .    in our three - neutron one - proton case",
    "a way of distinguishing physically meaningful states is by considering first the two - neutron excitations . from the calculated states one can single - out the resonances which are very broad or otherwise unphysical ( for instance energy eigenvalues with real as well as imaginary negative parts ) .    in order to introduce the physically meaningful two - neutron states in the formalism",
    "we will apply the msm . in this method one",
    "solves the shell model equations in several steps .",
    "one first chooses a single - particle representation .",
    "then one evaluates the two - body equations .",
    "next one solves the three - body equations within a basis consisting of the tensorial product of the one- and two - body basis previously evaluated .",
    "for the four - particle case one can choose as a basis the one- times three - particle basis states already evaluated or the two- times two - particle basis , and so on . in our case",
    "we will first solve the two - neutron states as done in refs .",
    "we will thus sort out the physical meaningful states to be used in the three - neutron case .",
    "besides the advantage of reducing the basis dimensions , the inclusion of these meaningful two - particle states implies that relevant continuum ( scattering ) states , that is those continuum states that determine the physically meaningful two - particle resonances , are also included .",
    "in the next msm step we will evaluate the three - neutron states in a basis consisting of the one- times two - particle states . finally , with the three - neutron states thus determined we will form the one - proton three - neutron msm basis to evaluate the spectrum of @xmath0li .",
    "the formalism corresponding to these calculations starts by choosing the single - particle ( berggren ) states . using the berggren representation thus chosen one",
    "gets the two - particle shell - model equations in the complex energy plane ( cxsm ) @xcite , i.e. , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the residual interaction .",
    "the tilde in the interaction matrix element denotes mirror states so that in the corresponding radial integral there is not any complex conjugate , as required by the berggren metric .",
    "the two - particle states are labeled by @xmath34 and latin letters label single - particle states .",
    "@xmath35 is the correlated two - particle energy and @xmath36 is single - particle energy .",
    "the two - particle wave function is given by @xmath37 where the two - particle creation operator is given by , @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the angular momentum of the two - particle state .",
    "we will use a separable interaction , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , which describes well the two - neutron states in @xmath2li .",
    "the energies are thus obtained by solving the corresponding dispersion relation .",
    "the two - particle wave function amplitudes are given by @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the single particle matrix element of the field defining the separable interaction and @xmath42 is the normalization constant determined by the condition @xmath43 .    with the two - neutron states",
    "thus evaluated we proceed to the calculation of the three - neutron states by using the msm in the complex energy plane ( cxmsm ) , as briefly described below .",
    "as its name indicates , the multistep shell model method ( msm ) solves the shell model equations in several steps . in the first step the single - particle representation",
    "is chosen . in the second step the energies and wave functions of the two - particle system",
    "are evaluated by using a given two - particle interaction .",
    "the three - particle states are evaluated in terms of a basis consisting of the tensorial product of the one- and two - particle states previously obtained . in this step",
    "the interaction does not appear explicitly in the formalism .",
    "instead , it is the wave functions and energies of the components of the msm basis that replace the interaction .",
    "the msm basis is overcomplete and non - orthogonal . to correct",
    "this one needs to evaluate the overlap matrix among the basis states .",
    "a general description of the formalism is in ref .",
    "the particular system that is of our interest here , i.e. , the three - particle case , can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the msm was applied to study the three - neutron hole states in the nucleus @xmath44pb .    using the berggren single - particle representation described above",
    ", we will evaluate the complex energies and wave functions of @xmath0li using the msm basis states consisting of the berggren one - particular states , which are states in @xmath31li , times the two - neutron excitations that determine the low lying spectrum of @xmath2li .",
    "below we refer to this formalism as cxmsm .",
    "the three - particle energies @xmath45 are given by @xcite @xmath46 where latin letters label single - particle states and @xmath47 are the corresponding single - particle energies .",

    "( [ tda3 ] ) is not hermitian and the dimension may be larger than the corresponding shell - model dimension .",
    "this is due to the violations of the pauli principle as well as overcounting of states in the cxmsm basis .",
    "therefore the direct diagonalization of eq .",
    "( [ tda3 ] ) is not convenient .",
    "one needs to calculate the overlap matrix in order to transform the cxmsm basis into an orthonormal set . in this three - particle case",
    "the overlap matrix is @xmath55    using the overlap one can transform the matrix determined by eq .",
    "( [ tda3 ] ) into a hermitian matrix @xmath56 which has the right dimension .",
    "the diagonalization of @xmath56 provides the three - particle energies .",
    "the corresponding wave function amplitudes can be readily evaluated to obtain @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the three - particle creation operator .",
    "it has to be pointed out that in cases where the basis is overcomplete the amplitudes @xmath59 are not uniquely defined and , therefore , they do not have physical meaning , instead , the projection of the basis vector upon the corresponding physical vector , i.e. , @xmath60 is well defined .    that the cxmsm wave function amplitudes are usually not well defined is no hinder to evaluate the physical quantities .",
    "for details see ref .",
    "it has to be pointed out that this feature does not appear when the basis is orthonormal , as in the one - proton three - neutron case to be analyzed below , since neither the pauli principle nor overcounting of states are relevant here .",

    "the large number of scattering states included in the single - particle representation the dimension of the three - particle basis is also large .",
    "the scattering states are needed in order to describe these unstable states .    with the cxmsm basis",
    "thus constructed we evaluated the dynamical matrix eq .",
    "( [ tda3 ] ) and the overlap eq .",
    "( [ overlap ] ) . with these we formed the symmetric hamiltonian matrix which we diagonalized to obtain the three - neutron states .",
    "we found that the lowest state is @xmath129 at ( -0.381,+0.023 ) mev .",
    "that is , the energy is real and negative .",
    "it is an antibound state , as it is the @xmath23 state itself .",
    "a manifestation of this is that the radial wave function diverges at large distances .    with the three - neutron states thus calculated and the proton state @xmath29 we constructed the final cxmsm basis to describe the nucleus @xmath0li .",
    "in this case the one - proton three - neutron cxmsm basis is orthonormal and the matrix ( [ tda4 ] ) is already the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "all the three - neutron quantities appearing in eq .",
    "( [ tda4 ] ) have been solved in the previous step of the cxmsm . instead , the single - proton energy and the proton - neutron interaction matrix elements are quantities that we have still to determine .",
    "the single - proton energy was not considered so far . when we evaluated the ground state of @xmath2li(@xmath130 we assumed that its energy was only determined by the two - neutron excitations .",
    "the value of the energy was obtained by fitting the strength of the neutron - neutron separable interaction , ignoring any effect that the protons may have had . in the analysis of the spectrum of @xmath2li , including the wave functions , this is irrelevant , since the assumption in those calculations was that the protons were only spectators . in other words ,",
    "the effect of the odd proton was only an scaling of the energies .",
    "a similar feature occurs in the evaluation of the three - neutron one - proton states . as seen in eq .",
    "( [ tda4 ] ) the value of the proton energy @xmath131 , where @xmath62 is the proton state @xmath29 , only shift the spectrum , but the relative energy between two given states is not affected . again here the effect of the proton degree of freedom regarding the single - particle energy is to scale the whole spectrum of @xmath0li .",
    "the determination of @xmath131 is a difficult task due to the energy renormalizations that our procedure implies .",
    "however , it should be a real number , since the proton is a bound state .",
    "we will , therefore , not intend to evaluate the absolute energies and only discuss the @xmath0li energies relative to the corresponding ground state energy .",
    "this is equivalent to take @xmath131 as a real parameter that adjust the real part of the ground state energy of @xmath0li .",
    "the proton - neutron interaction matrix elements were taken from empirical effective interactions which are determined by fitting experimental data @xcite .    with the quantities entering the hamiltonian matrix ( [ tda4 ] ) determined as discussed above , we calculated the energies @xmath132 and the wave function amplitudes @xmath133 .",
    "notice that in this case of an orthonormal basis the wave function components @xmath59 and the corresponding projections @xmath71 ( eq . ( [ funf ] ) )",
    "coincide .    due to",
    "the presence of the continuum states the dimension of the one - proton three - neutron basis is very large .",
    "of all the states calculated within this basis we will present only those which are physically meaningful . as we have discussed above ,",
    "the main configurations in such states contain large contributions from the poles ( relevant configurations ) .",
    "we therefore will proceed as in the evaluation of the two - neutron states and consider physically meaningful the one - proton three - neutron basis states for which at least the amplitude of one relevant configuration is , in absolute value , 0.3 or larger .    below we will briefly describe the structure of the states thus calculated forming the @xmath0li spectrum .",
    "the three lowest levels are from @xcite , while the one at 1.5 mev is from @xcite .",
    "the theoretical results are labelled cxmsm.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    as seen in fig .",
    "[ smen ] there are five states at low energy predicted by the theory .",
    "all of them are narrow and mainly built upon configurations that are close to the continuum threshold .",
    "this is not surprising since the determining poles at low energy are the antibound state @xmath24 and the resonance @xmath25 , and both have real or nearly real energies and are very close to threshold ..    the @xmath0li ground state is @xmath1 and its energy is real . since it is neither a bound state ( its wave function diverges at large distances ) neither a resonance ( its energy is a real quantity ) we conclude that it is an antibound state .",
    "this is not surprising , since it is mainly built upon the cxmsm basis state @xmath134{2 ^ -}\\rangle$ ] , where @xmath135 ( @xmath136 ) indicates proton ( neutron ) degree of freedom .",
    "the three - neutron component of this state is dominated by the state @xmath137 and this induces the state @xmath138 to be antibound .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that the influence of the @xmath137 antibound single - particle state is due to its position , lying very close to the continuum threshold .",
    "since there is no barrier to trap inside the nucleus the neutron moving in this state , the corresponding wave function is very similar to the one corresponding to a bound state at the same small and negative energy @xcite . within the continuum shell model",
    "the influence of the antibound state is taken into account by the scattering states on the real energy axis lying close to the continuum threshold @xcite . even in the complex energy plane",
    "the scattering wave functions lying close to the antibound state are similar to each other @xcite .",
    "a discussion on the conveniences and drawbacks of using the complex energy plane to describe the antibound state can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the question one may ask is how is it possible that in @xmath0li three neutrons can occuppy the state @xmath23 .",
    "the answer to this is that in the continuum this state is split in many components .",
    "the other states at low energy in fig .",
    "[ smen ] are built upon the proton single - particle state @xmath29 coupled to the three - neutron states @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "they are all narrow states .    besides these states",
    "there are many levels that lie above 1 mev which are built upon the pole @xmath79 .",
    "this may explain the broad resonance seen experimentally at about 1.5 mev .",
    "the experiment shows two narrow excited states below 0.5 mev , which the calculation predicts to be @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "most of the calculated levels in fig .",
    "[ smen ] are strongly influenced by the continuum states .",
    "if we would take only relevant configurations with amplitudes larger than 0.9 then only two states would appear .",
    "if no continuum configurations are included then no excited state below 1.1 mev would be found , as can be seen in the shell model calculation of ref .",
    "in this paper we have studied excitations occurring in the continuum part of the nuclear spectrum which are at the limit of what can be observed within present experimental facilities .",
    "these states are very unstable but yet live a time long enough to be amenable to be treated within stationary formalisms .",
    "we have thus adopted the cxsm ( shell model in the complex energy plane @xcite ) for this purpose .",
    "in addition we performed the shell model calculation by using the multistep shell model . in this method of solving the shell model equations one proceeds in several steps . in each step one constructs building blocks to be used in future steps @xcite .",
    "we applied this formalism to analyze the spectrum of @xmath0li by assuming that it is determined by one - proton three - neutron excitations .",
    "first we studied the neutron degrees of freedom by profiting from the information that exits on the single - neutron states in @xmath31li and on two - neutron states in @xmath2li . in our case of @xmath0li",
    "the neutron excitations correspond to the motion of three neutrons , partitioned as the one- times two - neutron systems .",
    "this formalism was applied before , e.g. , to study multiplets in the lead region @xcite .",
    "finally , the spectrum of @xmath0li is calculated by coupling the three - neutron system with the @xmath29 single - proton state .",
    "we adopted the single - particle energies ( i.e. , states in @xmath31li ) as provided by experimental data when available or as provided by our calculation .",
    "these are the antibound state @xmath23 and the resonances @xmath27 and @xmath79 . besides these states ( which are poles of the green function ) we also included continuum states ( coulomb waves ) .",
    "we found that the physically meaningful two - neutron states are mainly built upon poles . with the two - particle states thus obtained we calcuated the three - neutron states and coupled them to the @xmath29 protons state to evaluate the spectrum of @xmath0li , the ground state energy of this nucleus turns out to be real . since this is neither a bound states ( the wave function diverge at large distances ) nor a resonance ( the energy us real ) we conclude that it is an antibound states .",
    "this agrees with a number of experiments @xcite .",
    "besides this antibound state our calculation predicts two low lying narrow states which , as seen in fig .",
    "[ smen ] , are also found experimentally .",
    "but there are also three other calculated levels which have not been observed so far .",
    "we conclude that the experimentally observed narrow states in @xmath0li arise as a result of the valence neutrons moving in unstable shells . as in @xmath2li , these are mainly the antibound state @xmath23 and the narrow resonance @xmath27 .",
    "but in @xmath0li continuum states lying close to threshold play also a fundamental role .",
