    "establishing the excitation spectrum of a composite system has historically been one of the most effective ways to determine the detailed nature of the interactions between its constituents . establishing the excitation spectrum of the nucleon ;",
    "a complex bound system of valence quarks , sea quarks and gluons , is currently one of the highest priority goals of hadron and nuclear physics .",
    "the spectrum is a fundamental constraint on our understanding of the nature of qcd confinement in light quark systems .",
    "recent advances in theory have linked the excitation spectrum to qcd via lattice predictions  @xcite and holographic dual theories  @xcite . these complement the phenomenological qcd - based models such as constituent quark models  @xcite and soliton models  @xcite .    despite its importance , the spectrum of nucleon resonances remains poorly established with the basic properties ( electromagnetic couplings , masses , widths ) and even the existence of many excited states uncertain ( for a review see ref .",

    "a major program of measurements utilizing polarized photon beams , polarized targets and final - state nucleon polarimeters is currently underway with the goal to achieve a `` complete '' , model - independent measurement of photoproduction reactions .",
    "the process @xmath4 has the lowest energy threshold for photoproduction reactions with final - state particles containing strange valence quarks .",
    "this is a crucial channel as many models predict that some poorly established or `` missing '' resonances couple strongly to strange decay channels  @xcite .",
    "isospin conservation demands that only @xmath5 and not @xmath6 resonances contribute to the reaction , simplifying the interpretation of the data .",
    "the weak decay of the @xmath7 allows access to its polarization from the distribution of its decay particles and ensures that @xmath4 will be the first photoproduction reaction measured with a complete set of experimental observables , providing a benchmark channel for pwas .",

    "unfortunately the cross - section data have discrepancies that lead to significant differences in the pwa solutions when using either data set ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) , however , measurements of @xmath8 with similar analysis procedures give closer agreement .    @xmath4 data with fine center - of - mass energy ( @xmath3 ) resolution would be an important constraint on the existence of narrow @xmath5 states  @xcite .",
    "a number of recent searches for narrow @xmath5 near 1700 mev ( ref .",
    "@xcite for example ) were motivated by the prediction of a non - strange , nucleon - like , member of the anti - decuplet with strong photocoupling to the neutron  @xcite . in response to recent evidence , a speculative new @xmath5 state at 1685",

    "the experimental trigger required a total energy deposit in the crystal ball crystals of 360  mev and at least three of 45 geometric trigger sections to fire .",
    "the extraction of @xmath17 and @xmath18 channels is complicated by the much larger yields from non - strange channels .",

    "<S> measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 cross - sections have been obtained with the photon tagging facility and the crystal ball calorimeter at mami - c . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement uses a novel @xmath2 meson identification technique in which the weak decay products are characterized using the energy and timing characteristics of the energy deposit in the calorimeter , a method that has the potential to be applied at many other facilities . the fine center - of - mass energy ( @xmath3 ) resolution and statistical accuracy of the new data results in a significant impact on partial wave analyses aiming to better establish the excitation spectrum of the nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> the new analyses disfavor a strong role for quark - diquark dynamics in the nucleon .    </S>",
