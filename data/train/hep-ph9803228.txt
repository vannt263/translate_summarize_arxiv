    "<S> by considering the constraints from nucleon decay we obtain upper limits on @xmath0 in generalized supersymmetric @xmath1 grand unified theories with gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the predicted values of @xmath2 in these models are mostly inconsistent with the constraints from nucleon decay . </S>",
    "<S> +    supersymmetric ( susy ) grand unified theories ( guts ) are presently considered to be among the most promising candidates for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , for phenomenological reasons , supersymmetry can not be exact and it is usually assumed that the theory includes a visible sector containing the observable particles , and a hidden sector where supersymmetry is broken . </S>",
    "<S> susy breaking can be communicated to the visible sector either by gravitational interactions , as in supergravity ( sugra ) inspired models , or by sm gauge interactions , as in theories with gauge - mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) .    </S>",
    "<S> gmsb models were initially studied in the early 1980 s @xcite and have recently become the subject of much theoretical investigation . </S>",
    "<S> the revival of interest in these models @xcite is largely due to recent dramatic improvements in our understanding of nonperturbative effects in susy gauge theories as a result of the pioneering works of seiberg @xcite and seiberg and witten @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many new mechanisms for dynamical susy breaking ( dsb ) have been found since the appearance of @xcite and new dsb models have been constructed @xcite . from a phenomenological point of view , gmsb theories are interesting for a number of reasons . in these theories </S>",
    "<S> gauge interactions provide flavor - symmetric susy breaking terms and thus naturally suppress the flavor - changing neutral currents associated with soft squark and slepton masses . </S>",
    "<S> they also predict approximately degenerate squark and slepton masses ( see below ) and are specified by a relatively small number of parameters .    in gmsb theories the @xmath3 gauge interactions of the `` messenger '' fields communicate susy breaking from a hidden sector to the fields of the visible world . in the simplest of such models @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the particles in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , there exists at least one singlet superfield @xmath4 which couples to vector - like messenger superfields @xmath5 through the superpotential interaction @xmath6 at a scale @xmath7 tev , which is not much higher than the weak scale , susy is broken and both the lowest and @xmath8-component , @xmath9 , of the singlet superfield @xmath4 acquire vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) through their interactions with the hidden sector . </S>",
    "<S> the vev , @xmath10 , gives masses to the vector - like supermultiplets @xmath5 , while @xmath11 induces mass splittings within the supermultiplets . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the gaugino and sfermion masses are generated through their gauge couplings to the messenger fields . </S>",
    "<S> the gauginos receive masses at one - loop , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , while squarks and sleptons do so only at two - loop order , @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that @xmath15 , which is one of the attractive features of gmsb theories .    in the minimal version of the gmsb model @xcite , the messenger fields belong to the @xmath16 or @xmath17 representations of the @xmath1 gauge group , and the messenger </S>",
    "<S> yukawa couplings , @xmath18 s in ( [ eq1 ] ) , in any given @xmath1 representation are taken to be equal at the unification scale @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the spectrum at the messenger scale consists of a set of fields in complete su(5 ) representations and the mass splitting among the fields in a representation is induced through the renormalization group running of the messenger yukawa couplings from @xmath19 down to the messenger scale @xmath20 .    while the phenomenological implications of the minimal gmsb model have been extensively studied @xcite , non - minimal generalizations of this class of theories have seen less investigation . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we study generalized models of gmsb proposed by martin @xcite in which the messenger fields do not necessarily form complete @xmath1 gut multiplets . </S>",
    "<S> it is , in fact , not difficult to see how one may be naturally led to consider messenger fields which belong to incomplete representations of the @xmath1 gauge group in the generalized gmsb models . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the unification of the messenger yukawa couplings at the gut scale  whose mssm analogue is the so - called @xmath21 unification @xcite  is not necessarily required for gauge unification . </S>",
    "<S> suppose , for example , that in addition to @xmath4 there exist singlet superfields , @xmath22 , whose vevs ( but not the vevs of their @xmath8-components ) are just below the gut scale , and which couple only to some components of an @xmath1 multiplet . </S>",
    "<S> then within the @xmath1 multiplet these superfields acquire masses of order @xmath23 and decouple from the low - energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the other components , which get their masses only through couplings with the superfield @xmath4 , obtain masses of order @xmath24 . since @xmath25 is much smaller than the masses of the heavy superfields , these ( missing ) particles make negligible mass contributions and play a less important role in determining the mssm mass spectrum .    a fruitful approach for examining the phenomenological viability of susy guts has been to study processes that contribute to the nucleon decay @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in contrast to the minimal gmsb theories , in which constraints from the nucleon decay yield quite strong results @xcite , the situation in this regard is somewhat more complicated in the generalized gmsb models . in the minimal model one begins with the renormalization group running of the sm gauge coupling constants from the electroweak scale up to the gut scale to determine the mismatch between the sm and the @xmath1 gauge coupling constants at the gut scale . </S>",
    "<S> the mismatch , which is expressed in terms of the sum of the contributions coming from threshold corrections at the weak scale , the messenger scale , and the gut scale , can then be used to calculate the masses of the color - triplet higgs bosons , @xmath26 . on the other hand , in the generalized gmsb models </S>",
    "<S> the mass splitting within a given @xmath1 representation is undetermined and may result in large contributions to the mismatch at the gut scale . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the masses of the color - triplet higgs bosons can not , in general , be reliably determined in the same way as in the minimal model .    </S>",
    "<S> however , it is still possible to obtain useful constraints in the generalized @xmath1 gmsb models . </S>",
    "<S> the color - triplet higgs superfields belong to the @xmath27 representation of @xmath1 and , in general , the unification scale in @xmath1 guts can be reliably taken to be @xmath28 gev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that above the gut scale , e.g. at around the reduced planck scale , @xmath29 gev , other effects  such as those coming from string theory , for example  are expected to play an essential role . </S>",
    "<S> it is then safe to conclude that the masses of the color - triplet higgs fields can not be much larger than the gut scale . as a conservative upper bound </S>",
    "<S> , one can take @xmath30 gev . </S>",
    "<S> [ note that in the minimal gmsb model the calculated masses of the color - triplet higgs bosons are found to be around @xmath31 gev if the lep result @xmath32 is used @xcite . ]    </S>",
    "<S> let us now describe the gmsb models that are the subject of this letter . </S>",
    "<S> following martin @xcite , we shall consider five possible types of ( chiral ) superfields in the messenger sector of the generalized gmsb model @xmath33 where the multiplicities of the messenger fields are denoted by @xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> requiring that the gauge couplings remain perturbative , and assuming messenger field masses that do not greatly exceed @xmath35 tev , leads ( see @xcite for further discussion ) to the following set of multiplicites for the messenger fields @xmath36    the general low energy superpotential of the messenger sector is @xmath37 and the mssm spectrum can be determined once the messenger sector is fixed . in the numerical estimates that are reported here , we shall use @xmath38 tev . </S>",
    "<S> we can now directly calculate the nucleon decay rates for the gmsb models listed above by using the process @xmath39 as the characteristic mode . </S>",
    "<S> the short- and long - distance corrections and the hadronic matrix elements are taken at their conservative values , as e.g. in @xcite , giving a lower bound on the product @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied all the 53 possible models which satisfy criteria ( [ eq : martinlimits ] ) and contain massive gauginos . by setting the upper limit on the mass of the triplet higgs at @xmath41 gev , upper bounds on @xmath0 can be obtained and some interesting configurations for @xmath42 tev are listed in table  [ tab : cases ] . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters in the columns are the ones needed in the nucleon decay formula . </S>",
    "<S> we find a general bound , @xmath43 , except in cases ( 1,4,0,0,0 ) , ( 2,4,0,0,0 ) , and ( 1,3,0,0,0 ) for which this bound is @xmath44 .    </S>",
    "<S> there is also a lower bound on @xmath0 following from the nucleon decay constraints . however , </S>",
    "<S> this constraint is less severe than the one obtained by requiring that the yukawa couplings should not blow up at the gut scale , giving @xmath45 @xcite .    for comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we have also calculated the value of @xmath0 with the assumption of radiatively - broken @xmath46 symmetry when trilinear and bilinear soft couplings vanish at the messenger scale  which , among other things , free these models from the supersymmetric cp problem and make them extremely predictive . </S>",
    "<S> for the computations we use the full one - loop effective potential  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated values of @xmath0 are plotted versus the upper limit from nucleon decay in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are done for @xmath47 tev ( black circles ) and @xmath48 tev ( open rectangles ) . for @xmath47 tev , the values of @xmath49 are all larger than bounds from nucleon decay , whereas for @xmath50 tev , the values of @xmath51 from radiative symmetry breaking roughly double , and two of the models are allowed . </S>",
    "<S> these are the first two in table 1 . </S>",
    "<S> note that less than 53 points are plotted in fig .  1 since many of these models are on top of each and some of them ( four models ) turn out not to be physical .    to conclude </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the phenomenological viability of generalized supersymmetric @xmath1 grand unified theories with gauge - mediated susy breaking by calculating the upper limits on @xmath0 from nucleon decay in these theories . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the predicted values of @xmath0 are mostly inconsistent with the constraints from nucleon decay . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that if theories with gmsb are to be taken as serious susy gut candidates beyond the standard model , the bilinear and/or trilinear soft terms can not vanish at the messenger scale , and gauge groups other than @xmath1together with their associated implementation of dynamical susy breaking  are required for acceptable low - energy phenomenology . </S>"
