    "initial vortex research emphasized the equilibrium configurations , for example in rotating superfluid becs where imaging an expanded condensate provided direct visualization of the vortex arrays .    in certain cases for atomic becs ,",

    "the physics of two coupled bose - einstein condensates has been of great interest since the early jila experiments using two hyperfine states of @xmath1rb  @xcite .",
    "initially , these coupled condensates had the usual mean - field interactions , in which case the typical gross - pitaevskii equation contains two interaction terms proportional to the two local particle densities @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "correspondingly , the interaction energy density is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the condensate density for component @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is a set of interaction parameters .",
    "since this interaction energy depends solely on the densities , it carries no information on the relative phase of the two condensates .",
    "subsequently , the jila group added coherent rf rabi fields involving direct linear off - diagonal coupling of the two order parameters  @xcite . in the time - dependent gp equation for ( say ) @xmath8 , there is a term with @xmath9 proportional to the rabi frequency @xmath10 , which is related to the strength of the rf coupling fields .",
    "the corresponding coherent rf rabi interaction energy density @xmath11 is very different from the more familiar mean - field form given above . as a result",
    ", the two components now form a coupled two - level system with dynamics analogous to coherent motion on a bloch sphere .    in 2002",
    "@xcite , son and stephanov pointed out the crucial role of such coherent rf rabi coupling , emphasizing the presence of a narrow domain wall between two vortices , whose dynamics closely mimics string - breaking processes in quantum chromodynamics . with the density - phase representation of the condensate order parameters @xmath12 ,",
    "the coherent coupling energy density becomes @xmath13 , involving the phase difference between the two condensates .",

    "this form of the lagrangian density is useful for studying the dynamics of vortices in coherently coupled becs .",
    "much of the present analysis will focus on a tightly confined effectively two - dimensional condensate , in which case @xmath20 represents a two - dimensional particle density with dimension of an inverse area and the corresponding coupling constants are renormalized by the tight axial harmonic trapping potential @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the axial oscillator length . for simplicity ,",

    "these various features combine in section  [ 2bec ] to describe the dynamics of two vortices in coherently coupled uniform becs with one vortex in each component .",

    "section  [ josephsondynamics ] then investigates the josephson - like dynamics of the coherent transfer of population between two coherently coupled condensates . in the absence of a vortex , the population difference exhibits familiar rabi oscillation  @xcite .",
    "when a vortex is present in one condensate , however , the lack of overall global phase leads to a cancelation , and instead the vorticity transfers periodically between the two components with no coherent population transfer , in analogy with similar results for coherently coupled annular condensates  @xcite .",

    "their dynamical equations lead to the expected dynamics @xmath37 so that vortex 1 moves with the velocity induced at its location by vortex 2 .",
    "similarly , @xmath38 if they have the same circulation with @xmath39 , they rotate at fixed @xmath40 around their joint center at an instantaneous linear speed @xmath41 with a sense determined by their individual circulations [ equivalently , the angular velocity around the common center is @xmath42 .",
    "if they have opposite circulations @xmath43 , they are called a vortex pair or a vortex dipole and move uniformly at fixed @xmath40 with translational velocity @xmath41 in the direction of the flow between them .",
    "the arizona group  @xcite has created such vortex dipoles reproducibly in disk - shaped becs and followed their dynamical trajectories .",
    "the finite boundaries significantly affect the motion , and the experiment observed one full cycle of the vortex dipole orbits .",
    "as seen below , the energy of two vortices in an unbounded medium depends only on the distance between them , so that both these dynamical motions maintain the total energy .",
    "this behavior reflects the lack of any dissipative mechanism in classical hydrodynamics .    in a uniform",
    "dilute bose gas obeying the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation , the same result holds as long as the vortices are well separated relative to the healing length @xmath44 , which characterizes the vortex core radius .",
    "reference  @xcite proved this result by direct examination of the time - dependent gp equation , assuming that the time dependence arises solely from the rigid motion of the vortices .",
    "this result is not surprising , for the time - dependent gp equation implies both the usual conservation of particles and a bernoulli equation for isentropic compressible flow ; these two suffice to describe classical inviscid hydrodynamics , including vortex motion  @xcite .",
    "from one perspective , eq .",
    "( [ vortexdyn ] ) wholly suffices to describe the motion of point vortices in a uniform two - dimensional fluid , but it is instructive to generalize and think of effective forces . note the simple identity  @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is essentially the coulomb green s function in two dimensions .",

    "the vector sum of all forces acting on the vortex must vanish , which thus determines the motion of the vortex .",
    "effectively , a vortex has intrinsic angular momentum arising from its circulating flow and acts like a gyroscope .    for subsequent reference , it is also useful to study the behavior of two vortices in a uniform single - component two - dimensional bec with the time - dependent lagrangian formalism , which is equivalent to eq .",

    "the corresponding fluid velocity is @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is given in ( [ vj ] ) , and the kinetic energy density is @xmath86 .",

    "the equations of vortex dynamics have a hamiltonian form with @xmath98 and @xmath99 as canonical coordinates . in the presence of boundaries , the factor @xmath100",
    "is replaced by the appropriate green s function @xmath101 that satisfies the relevant boundary condition  @xcite .",
    "this description is readily generalized to include a type - ii superconductor . in general , a superconductor can screen a static magnetic field beyond the characteristic london penetration length @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the effective superconducting plasma frequency defined with the superconducting electron density @xmath104  @xcite .",

    "hence the long - range interaction potential varies like @xmath113 , intermediate between the @xmath114 dependence of a neutral superfluid and the @xmath115 dependence of a bulk type - ii superconductor  @xcite .",
    "this latter paper also contains a general discussion of the relation between the hydrodynamic view that each vortex moves with the local superfluid velocity and the energy view based on the interaction potential and the magnus effect .",

    "the present consideration of vortex dynamics starts from classical hydrodynamics and then introduces the idea of logarithmic vortex interactions .",
    "in contrast , the time - dependent variational lagrangian formalism focuses on the phase @xmath74 of the condensate wave function for various components , and it is worth examining this aspect in more detail .    the simplified lagrangian density in ( [ lsimp ] ) studies the phase of each condensate @xmath81 and @xmath82 , omitting any spatial and temporal variation in the densities @xmath2 and @xmath3 along with the trap potential .",
    "the time derivatives yield the time - dependent term @xmath333 in the lagrangian , @xmath407 , and the gradient terms yield the kinetic term in the gp energy @xmath408 . in the limit of relatively weak rabi rf coupling ( @xmath409 ) ,",

    "the time derivative becomes @xmath411 .",
    "thus @xmath412 determines both the time term @xmath333 and the kinetic energy part of @xmath413 in the lagrangian @xmath414 .",
    "the presence of rabi rf coupling alters this picture because it provides an additional term @xmath148 in the energy .",
    "this energy gives rise to an additional force @xmath415 with different dependence on the vortex separation and even a different sign from that arising from the intervortex potential .",
    "indeed , for two positive vortices , one in each component of a two - component unbounded condensate , the rotation rate is in the negative sense . in contrast , two positive vortices in classical hydrodynamics or in a one - component bec would rotate in the positive sense .",
    "the picture changes significantly for strong rabi coupling @xmath416 for uniform condensates ( or @xmath417 for tf trapped condensates ) .",
    "the coupling energy now varies linearly with the vortex separation , and the rotation frequency in ( [ rot2 ] ) agrees with that found with somewhat different methods by the trento group  @xcite .",
    "the results of our numerical simulations closely match the theoretical derivations .",
    "in particular , we have verified that the rotation frequency of a pair of positive vortices changes sign as a function of the applied rabi frequency , and our results converge to the theoretical prediction of the lagrangian formulation at strong rabi coupling , and to the value expected for single off - centered vortices in a cylindrical container in the opposite limit of weak rabi coupling .",
    "moreover , we have verified that if a single vortex is imprinted in only one of the components , the rabi coupling drives an interesting dynamics , where the vortex is coherently transferred from one component to the other .",
    "finally , we have shown that this coherent transfer of vorticity happens with no transfer of population .",
    "the numerical results rely on an open source library  @xcite , and we wish to promote the practice of open science by making the steps involved in the simulations available online  @xcite .",
