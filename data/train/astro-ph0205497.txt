    "many jets emanating from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) show narrow and well - collimated structures from less than a parsec ( pc ) up to mpc scales ( e.g. , zensus 1997,references therein ) . from a theoretical point of view ,",
    "several models were proposed concerning the formation and collimation process of a jet . for the formation of jets , radiative pressure models",
    "( e.g. , icke 1980 , 1989 ; sikora et al .",
    "1996 ) and magnetic field models ( e.g. , benford 1978 ; blandford , payne 1982 ; uchida , shibata 1985 , 1986 ; meier et al .",
    "2001 ; koide et al .",
    "2002 ) have been mainly discussed . in the latter models ,",
    "the toroidal component is crucial for the collimation process , and because of the toroidal component both the formation and collimation of jets would be simultaneously explained .",
    "high - resolution observations using very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) have recently been providing some evidence in support for the mhd models ( junor et al .",
    "1999 ; gabuzda 2000 ; gabuzda et al .",
    "it is , however , not simple to see the toroidal component or helical structure of the magnetic field by observing the projected direction of the magnetic fields .",
    "the well - known quasar 3c 273 , at a redshift of @xmath0 , is one of the brightest quasars . for a hubble constant of @xmath1 = 100  km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 and a deceleration parameter of @xmath3 ,",
    "an angular resolution of one milli - arcsecond ( mas ) corresponds to a linear resolution of 1.86pc .",
    "the jet components in 3c273 have displayed superluminal motions ( cohen et al .",
    "1971 ) , with the speeds of the apparent proper motion being 4.9 to 7.7 @xmath4 derived from vlbi monitoring observations ( abraham et al . 1996 ) .",
    "a vlbi space observatory programme ( vsop ) observation revealed a double - helical structure in the 3c273 jet , which was attributed to a kelvin ",
    "helmholtz ( k  h ) instability ( lobanov , zensus 2001 ) .",
    "vlbi polarimetric observations have shown that the jet of 3c 273 is highly polarized ( roberts et al .",
    "1990 ) , which makes it suitable to study the rotation measure ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "observations with the very large array ( vla ) showed @xmath5 variations of 5 rad m@xmath6 on the arcsecond scale ( roberts et al .",
    "1990 ) . on the mas scale , however , very long baseline array ( vlba ) observations revealed @xmath5s of up to 2000 rad m@xmath6 towards the nuclear regions , while towards the jet the @xmath5s are around 200 rad m@xmath6 ( taylor 1998 ) .",
    "the high @xmath5s towards the core are probably caused by the magnetic field and plasma in the narrow line region ( nlr ) around the core ( taylor 1998 ) .",
    "to investigate the 3d structure of the magnetic field , a detailed analysis of both the @xmath5 and the polarization angle ( @xmath7 ) should be useful .",
    "the @xmath5 is related to the electron density , @xmath8 , and the magnetic field component parallel to the line of sight , @xmath9 , as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 represents integration along the line of sight . in an optically thin plasma ,",
    "the projected direction of the magnetic field ( a component perpendicular to the line of sight ) is perpendicular to @xmath7 .",
    "since @xmath5 is measured by the polarization angles ( @xmath12 ) at different wavelengths ( @xmath13 ) through the equation @xmath14 , a more accurate @xmath5 can be measured at longer wavelengths . when the @xmath5 is very large , however",
    ", longer - wavelength observations may result in aliasing due to the 180@xmath15 ambiguity of @xmath7 . to avoid this , a combination of observations at either ( i ) both long and short wavelengths or ( ii ) multiple longer wavelengths separated by only a small wavelength difference is required .",
    "therefore , a proper selection of observing the frequencies is essential in deriving the @xmath5 distribution of jets .",
    "vlba polarimetry could thus give one of essential information as to whether or not the magnetic field plays a dominant role in jet formation and/or collimation .",
    "we analyzed polarimetric observations of the 3c273 jet based on archival vlba data .",
    "observations were carried out on 1995 december 9 at 4.702 , 4.760 , 4.890 , and 4.990 ghz in the 5ghz band and 1995 november 22 at 8.102 , 8.240 , 8.420 , and 8.590 ghz in the 8ghz band using all ten stations of the vlba .",
    "each if has an 8-mhz bandwidth .",
    "the target of these observations was m87 , with 3c273 being observed as a calibration source .",
    "both left and right circular polarizations were recorded at each station .",
    "an _ a priori _ amplitude calibration for each station was derived from a measurement of the antenna gain and system temperatures during each run .",
    "fringe fitting was performed on each if and polarization independently using the aips task fring . after deriving the delay and rate difference between parallel - hand cross correlations ,",
    "the cross - hand correlations were fringe fitted to determine the cross - hand delay difference .",
    "once the cross - hand delay difference was determined , the instrumental polarizations of the antennas were determined for each if in the same bands with an unpolarized source , oq 208 , using the aips task pcal .",
    "the polarization angle offset at each station was calibrated using data of oj 287 observed by the university of michigan radio astronomy observatory ( umrao ) .",
    "we note that the difference in the observing dates by umrao and vlba is within 1 day and 5 days for 5 and 8 ghz , respectively ; thus , the chance of variability between the two observations is small . because the total polarized flux of oj287 measured by the vlba is 31.8 @xmath16 1.7 mjy at 5 ghz and 26.4 @xmath16 1.3 mjy at 8 ghz , while the polarized fluxes measured by the umrao are 32.7 @xmath16 6.1 mjy and 24.9 @xmath16 13.7 mjy , respectively , the corresponding values are equal within the errors , confirming that a very high fraction of the integrated polarized flux was present on vlba scales .",
    "we applied the same position angle calibrations for each if within the 5 ghz and 8 ghz bands .",
    "the integrated @xmath5 of oj287 based on vla observations is small , + 31 rad m@xmath6 ( rudnick , jones 1983 ) .",
    "the corresponding differences in the @xmath5 for different frequencies within the 5 ghz and 8 ghz bands are negligible , justifying our use of the same @xmath7 calibration for all ifs at each frequency .",
    "we also note that even if a small offset in the @xmath5 were introduced , it would be constant all over the source , and could not give rise to structure in the @xmath5 distribution .",
    "images were initially obtained using difmap , then imported into aips to self - calibrate the full datasets using the task calib before the final difmap image . in order to obtain the distributions of @xmath5 and @xmath7 , we tapered images at higher frequencies to match the resolution of the lowest frequency observation .",
    "the restored beam size was 3.4 mas @xmath17 1.4 mas with the major axis at a position angle of @xmath183.@xmath157 . in order to register images at different frequencies ,",
    "we refer to optically thin components of jet . as a result ,",
    "the error of alignment was estimated to be within 10",
    "we show images of the polarized intensities overlaid on the total intensity images at 5 and 8 ghz in figures 1a and b , respectively .",
    "the core is located at the northeast end of the jet , and the jet extends along a position angle of 234@xmath15 .",
    "the counter - jet is invisible , presumably due to doppler de - boosting .",
    "the core is weakly polarized at the level of @xmath19 and @xmath20 at 5 and 8 ghz , as seen in previous observations ( leppnen et al .",
    "1995 ; roberts et al . 1990 ; taylor 1998 ) .",
    "the fractional polarization of component c3 at 8 ghz is 8% , while that at 5 ghz is 0.5% .",
    "this suggests that this component is depolarized ; however , there are no obvious signs of depolarization within the 5 ghz and 8 ghz bands .",
    "component c3 has a flat spectrum with @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) between 5 ghz and 8 ghz .",
    "we show the distribution of the projected magnetic field , which is obtained by de - rotating the @xmath12 to remove the effect of the @xmath5 , superposed on the total intensity contours in figure  2 .",
    "the projected magnetic field initially runs roughly parallel to the jet , then turns oblique to it at the southwestern edge of c2 .",
    "the @xmath5 distribution is shown in pseudo color in figure  3 .",
    "regions of lower fractional polarization could not give a reliable @xmath5 distribution because of the short observation time .",
    "the @xmath5 values on either side of the jet differ significantly from each other .",
    "this gradient clearly appeared in independent observations at 8 ghz and 15 ghz ( zavala , taylor 2001 ) . in figure  4 , we show the @xmath5 distribution along the cross - section slice ab at a position angle of 36@xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath5s differ by up to 210 rad m@xmath6 , where the error is less than 40 rad m@xmath6 and is typically 10 rad m@xmath6 .",
    "the variation can be confidently associated with the jet itself , since it is unlikely that a foreground faraday screen would produce such a strong fine structure comparable to the jet width ( taylor 1998 ) .",
    "it is possible that the distribution of @xmath5 could be due to a gradient in the gas density across the jet .",
    "however , in this case , we would expect to see some evidence of an interaction between the jet and this denser gas , such as the development of a sheath of longitudinal magnetic field due to shear ( cf .",
    "attridge et al . 1999 ) or sharp bending of the jet ( cf .",
    "nan et al .",
    "another interesting possibility is that the variation in the @xmath5 is related to differences in the component of the magnetic field along the line of sight .    indeed",
    ", the systematic distribution of @xmath5 across the jet can be very naturally interpreted in terms of a helical magnetic field .",
    "let us consider the simple case of the side view of a straight jet ( a viewing angle is 90@xmath15 ) with a helical magnetic field along the jet .",
    "the sign of @xmath9 differs on the two sides of the jet as the magnetic field reverses direction .",
    "we would see an anti - symmetric distribution of the @xmath5 across the jet . in this simple case",
    ", the @xmath5 would be zero at the center of the jet , because there is no @xmath9 component along the line of sight .",
    "when the viewing angle decreases , an anti - symmetric distribution would remain , with only the addition of an offset in the absolute value of the @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , the viewing angle to the jet of 3c273 must be small , as jet components show superluminal motion , with a viewing angle of @xmath23 16@xmath15 , estimated from a kinematical analysis ( abraham et al .",
    "the distribution is anti - symmetric across the jet with the @xmath5 biased by 330 rad m@xmath6 ( see figure  4 ) .",
    "if the viewing angle is smaller than the pitch angle , it is possible that @xmath9 always has the same sign . to illustrate this , we show the line - of - sight component of the helical magnetic field across the jet at several viewing angles in figure  5 .",
    "the observed bias is ascribed to the longitudinal component of the helical magnetic field with a small viewing angle .",
    "if this is the case , the toroidal component of the helical field is twisted like a right - hand screw as the jet moves downstream .",
    "we note that the helical magnetic field can naturally produce the double - helical structure revealed by the vsop observation ( lobanov , zensus 2001 ) , because the helical magnetic field thread the emitting plasma and are tied to it ( frozen - in ) .",
    "vsop monitoring observations would be able to discriminate between these two possibilities : a helical field or a k  h instability .",
    "the observed change in the direction of the projected magnetic field along the jet , as shown in figure  2 , can be explained by a change in the pitch angle of the helical field and incoherent polarization radiation .",
    "again , let us consider the simple case when we look at a helical magnetic field in an optically thin jet from the side view .",
    "the vector addition of the magnetic field integrated across the jet is always directed along the jet , independent of the pitch angle of the helical field .",
    "however , the polarization angle has an ambiguity of 180@xmath15 , because the polarization planes for two magnetic fields pointing in exactly opposite directions would be the same .",
    "therefore , the resultant direction of the polarization angle integrated across the jet would depend on the pitch angle of the field .",
    "when the pitch angle is small , the magnetic field runs almost parallel to the jet , and the @xmath7s on both the near and far sides of the jet are almost perpendicular to the jet , so that the @xmath7 integrated across the jet is also perpendicular to the jet . on the other hand , when the pitch angle is large , the magnetic field at any given point is almost perpendicular to the jet , and the corresponding polarization angles are almost parallel to the jet . since the polarization radiation is incoherent , the vector accumulation of the two polarization radiations is almost parallel , resulting in a sudden jump in the integrated polarization angle of 90@xmath15 as the pitch angle changes .",
    "the spectrum in the region where the projected magnetic field is perpendicular to the jet ( @xmath24 region ) is flatter than that in the region where the magnetic field is parallel to the jet ( @xmath25 region ) .",
    "the fractional polarization is up to 25@xmath26 in the @xmath24 region , compared to @xmath2710@xmath26 in the @xmath25 region .",
    "these facts , combined with the presence of the bright peak at the eastern edge of the @xmath24 region , suggest that this region is compressed by a shock . in fact , in the next bright region , further southwest ( i.e.  the c1 )",
    ", the magnetic field is again parallel to the jet , followed by a further knot where the magnetic field is essentially parallel along the jet .",
    "thus , the southwestern edge of c2 probably has a large pitch angle due to compression by the shock and , consequently , the integrated magnetic field appears to be perpendicular to the jet .",
    "in fact , the magnetic field structure is essentially the same as that in the @xmath25 region in terms of the systematic gradient of @xmath5 , which again indicates the helical field structure . on the line 3 mas southwest of the line ab , which is more than one beam apart , the amount of the @xmath5 gradient is 190 rad m@xmath6 , where the error is less than 27 rad m@xmath6 and is typically 10 rad m@xmath6 .",
    "this interpretation may also be applicable to the dichotomous nature of the apparent magnetic field properties in jets between quasars and bl lacs ( gabuzda et al .",
    "1989 , 1992 ) , which could be due simply to different pitch angles for their helical magnetic fields ( cf .",
    "gabuzda et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "we believe that the most likely mechanism for the generation of the helical jet magnetic field is that the original magnetic field has been wound up by rotation of the accretion disk ( e.g. uchida , shibata 1985 ) . in this case",
    ", we can identify that the accretion disk is rotating clockwise ( as we see it ) , because we know that the jet is approaching .",
    "taking into account the generation mechanism of the helical magnetic field by mhd model , one would then observe a rotation in which the northern half of the disk is going away , and the southern half is approaching us .",
    "next to m 87 ( ford et al . 1994 ; harms et al . 1994 ; macchetto et al .",
    "1998 ) and the maser observations of a megamaser source , ngc 4258 ( miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ) , we can predict the direction of rotation in the disk around a possible super - massive black hole . this can be applied to anything that is responsible for winding up the magnetic field , like a possible spinning super - massive black hole ( koide et al .",
    ". it would be interesting to confirm the @xmath5 distribution in a case in which the counter jet could also be observed .",
    "the distribution should be anti - symmetric with respect to the agn core , if the helical field is generated by the rotation of the accretion disk or the spinning black hole .",
    "in order to estimate the 3d structure of the magnetic field in the jet from agn , we have derived distributions of @xmath5 and projected magnetic field of 3c273 jet using archival data from a vlba polarimetry observation .",
    "the systematic gradient across the jet in the distribution of the @xmath5 is interpreted as the helical magnetic field that is suggested by mhd models .",
    "we derived the direction of the twist of the helical magnetic field as a right - hand screw from the sign of @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , two patterns of parallel and perpendicular to the jet axis in the projected magnetic fields could be explained well by the difference of the pitch angle of the helical magnetic field with incoherent polarization angles .",
    "this interpretation can be applied to the difference of the tendency in the direction of the magnetic field between quasars and bl lacs .",
    "it can be naturally predicted that the direction of the rotation of the accretion disk is clockwise , if the observed helical magnetic field is formed by mhd models .",
    "all these points are in favor of a helical magnetic field operating predominantly in jet formation .",
