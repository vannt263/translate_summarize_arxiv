    "the interactions of mesons in systems containing both light and heavy quarks have long been of interest to hadron physicists .",
    "for example , some models predict that the open - charm @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons have sufficiently attractive residual strong interactions with nucleons to form  charmed nuclei \" @xcite . charmed hadron bound states may exist in other systems as well ; novikov _ et al .",
    "_ long ago speculated that the nominal 3@xmath4s@xmath5 @xmath6 state @xmath7 might actually be a quasinuclear  molecule \" bound state of a @xmath8 pair @xcite .",
    "several quark model studies have shown that @xmath9 mesons should exist for sufficiently large heavy - quark mass @xmath10 ( for a recent review see richard @xcite ) . in a recent  pedagogical \" application ,",
    "the @xmath11 limit of the @xmath9 heavy - light system ( the so - called @xmath12 system ) has been used as a theoretical laboratory for the study of nuclear forces , and nuclear potential energy curves have been derived using the nonrelativistic quark model @xcite and lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) @xcite .",
    "recently , further interest in the interactions of light- and heavy - quark mesons has arisen in the context of heavy - ion collisions and the search for the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "one signature proposed for the identification of a qgp @xcite is the suppression of the rate of formation of the @xmath0 and other @xmath6 bound states .",
    "the long - ranged linear confining potential between a @xmath6 pair would purportedly be screened by a qgp , so a @xmath6 pair produced in the collision would be more likely to separate than to populate bound @xmath6 resonances .",
    "direct experimental confirmation of such a suppression can be detected for example through the observation of lepton pairs from the decay @xmath13 .",
    "the simplest interpretation of an observed @xmath13 signal would be to assume that all @xmath0 mesons survive until they decay outside the interaction region .",
    "however , if dissociation reactions such as @xmath14 and @xmath15 are important , the interpretation of the experiment is more complicated ; a weak @xmath0 signal might simply be due to dissociation through such ",
    "comover absorption \" processes .",
    "the actual size of these low - energy charmonium dissociation cross sections is currently very controversial , and their evaluation is the subject of this paper .",
    "a very wide range of theoretical estimates of low - energy charmonium dissociation cross sections has been reported in the literature , largely due to different assumptions for the dominant scattering mechanisms .",
    "we will briefly review the three main approaches used before presenting new results from our quark model calculations .",
    "quark model calculations of charmonium - light hadron cross sections were first reported by martins , blaschke and quack @xcite , who used a quark - interchange model @xcite to treat @xmath16 collisions .",
    "this reference used standard quark model one gluon exchange ( oge ) forces ( spin - spin hyperfine and color coulomb ) , augmented by a color - independent confining force that was assumed to act only between @xmath17 pairs ( no @xmath18 or @xmath19 anti - confining interaction ) .",
    "since the color coulomb terms experience destructive interference between diagrams ( due to color factors ) and the large mass of the charm quark makes the hyperfine term rather weak , martins _",
    "_ concluded that oge forces alone give rather small cross sections ; they estimated a cross section for @xmath20 of @xmath21  mb at @xmath22  gev .",
    "however their color - independent , @xmath17-only confining interaction had no color factor cancellation , and so gave a much larger peak cross section of @xmath23  mb near 4.1  gev .",
    "these two exclusive processes ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) were found to peak quite close to threshold , and then fell rapidly with increasing invariant mass due to suppression from the gaussian meson wavefunctions assumed .",
    "( see fig.2 of ref.@xcite . )",
    "subsequently , wong _ et al . _",
    "@xcite applied the same approach to this problem , _ albeit _ with the conventional quark model @xmath26 dependence for all terms in the interquark hamiltonian , including the linear confining potential .",
    "the interaction terms assumed were again color coulomb , spin - spin hyperfine and linear scalar confinement .",
    "the destructive interference between _ all _ diagrams , due to zero - sum color factors , led to a rather smaller @xmath27 cross section , with a rather broad peak of roughly 1  mb near 4.1  gev .",
    "also considered @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 dissociation , and found that these cross sections are much larger than @xmath16 near threshold , due to more favorable kinematics .",
    "the @xmath31 processes are exothermic , and so actually diverge at threshold .",
    "finally , wong _ et al .",
    "_ studied the importance of the so - called  post - prior ambiguity \" @xcite in these calculations ; the use of exact @xmath17 hamiltonian wavefunctions in the present paper eliminates much of this systematic effect , but an important discrepancy remains due to the use of relativistic phase space and physical masses .",
    "shuryak and teaney @xcite gave a comparable rough estimate of @xmath32  mb for a low - energy @xmath16 cross section driven by the nonrelativistic quark model s spin - spin interaction .",
    "actually the specific process they considered , @xmath33 , is zero at born order due to a vanishing color factor ; color was not incorporated in their estimate .",
    "charmonium - light hadron scattering can also take place through t - channel meson exchange .",
    "this mechanism was first discussed by matinyan and mller @xcite , who were motivated to study @xmath16 inelastic scattering by the great discrepancy between the ca",
    ". 7  mb quark - model result of martins _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and the very small low - energy cross sections found using the peskin - bhanot approach @xcite . in the meson - exchange picture , charmonium dissociation reactions proceed through t - channel exchange of charmed mesons such as @xmath2 and @xmath34 .",
    "matinyan and mller assumed only @xmath2 exchange , and found mb - scale cross sections for the two low - energy dissociation processes @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "this work has since been generalized to other t - channel exchanges and effective meson lagrangians .",
    "lin , ko and zhang had previously proposed an su(4 ) flavor symmetric vector - pseudoscalar meson effective lagrangian which they had applied to open - charm meson scattering @xcite .",
    "application of this same lagrangian to the @xmath16 dissociation reaction @xmath35 gave a rather large cross section of @xmath37  mb for @xmath38  gev @xcite ; this was much larger than the @xmath2-exchange results of matinyan and mller , due to new three- and four - meson vertices in their effective lagrangian .",
    "haglin @xcite introduced a similar su(4 ) symmetric meson lagrangian , and also found rather large cross sections of 5 - 10 mb for @xmath39-@xmath40  gev for many low energy charmonium dissociation reactions ( see for example fig.2 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "subsequent work by haglin and gale @xcite showed that the @xmath16 total inelastic cross section would reach an extremely large value of roughly 100 mb at @xmath41  gev , and @xmath29 a fantastic @xmath42  mb ( with both still increasing ) in this model , assuming pointlike hadron vertices .",
    "similar large @xmath16 and @xmath29 cross sections have been reported by oh , song and lee in pointlike meson exchange models @xcite .",
    "navarra _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have recently questioned the assumption of flavor su(4 ) symmetry ; keeping only isospin symmetry , they find rather smaller cross sections for @xmath35 , ca .",
    "20 - 25  mb at @xmath41  gev .",
    "they confirm that @xmath34 exchange is much more important numerically in meson exchange models than the @xmath2 exchange originally assumed by matinyan and mller .",
    "of course it is also incorrect to assume pointlike hadron form factors .",
    "this has been noted both by lin and ko @xcite and haglin and gale @xcite .",
    "both collaborations investigated the effect of assuming dipole forms for the effective three - meson vertices , and concluded that the predicted cross sections were greatly reduced ( once again to typically 1 - 10  mb scales ) with plausible vertex functions .",
    "( see for example fig.4 of ref.@xcite and fig.7 of ref.@xcite . )",
    "accurate calculations of hadronic vertex functions are clearly of crucial importance for meson exchange models of charmonium dissociation .",
    "some results for these form factors , obtained from qcd sum rules , have been published by navarra _",
    "_ @xcite .      a high - energy diffractive description of scattering of heavy quarkonia which was developed in 1979 by peskin and bhanot",
    "@xcite has also been applied to the calculation of charmonium cross sections .",
    "it should be stressed that this method is only justified at high energies @xcite , and then only for deeply - bound @xmath43 systems .",
    "it is in essence a gluon - sea model of high - energy diffractive scattering of physically small , high - mass coulombic bound states by light hadrons .",
    "this model predicts reasonable mb - scale cross sections for @xmath0 hadronic cross sections at @xmath44  gev @xcite . at low energies , however",
    ", this mechanism taken in isolation predicts extremely small ( sub-@xmath45b ) cross sections for @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( see fig.2 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "presumably this means that the peskin - bhanot diffractive scattering mechanism is unimportant in the low - energy regime of greatest relevance to qgp searches , and other mechanisms such as quark interchange and meson exchange dominate @xmath6 strong interactions at these low energies .",
    "indeed , a recent comparison @xcite with lattice gauge computations shows that the operator product expansion breaks down for quark masses below roughly 10 gev , and therefore the peskin model is inapplicable to light and charmed hadronic physics .",
    "redlich _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have argued that these diffractive cross sections are actually accurate at low energies , and if combined with vector dominance can account for the experimental @xmath48 open charm cross section , whereas the much larger meson - exchange result for @xmath49 of haglin @xcite greatly exceeds the charm photoproduction measured in experiment , assuming vector dominance through the @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite however argue that this test is misleading , as the assumption of vector dominance through the @xmath0 alone is unrealistic for these processes . since the @xmath50 is much closer to open charm threshold than the @xmath0 , and is predicted to have larger dissociation cross sections to open charm , this is clearly a potential source of inaccuracy for any @xmath0-only vector dominance model .",
    "finally , qcd sum rule calculations have been performed @xcite which find a much larger low - energy cross section than the diffraction model ref.@xcite , and are in rough agreement with quark interchange results near threshold . although there is approximate agreement of scale at low energies , the sum rule results find that the exclusive cross sections increase monotonically with energy .",
    "we believe that this is incompatible with hadronic form factors , which may require the inclusion of higher - dimensional operators in the sum rule calculations .",
    "clearly the scale of charmonium dissociation cross sections at low energies remains an open question .",
    "neither the experimental values nor the dominant scattering mechanisms have been convincingly established . in this currently rather obscure situation we can best proceed by deriving the predictions of the various models and searching for the least ambiguous comparisons with experiment , in as unbiased a manner as possible . here",
    "we attempt to contribute to this research through a careful and detailed study of the predictions of one of the theoretical approaches , the quark interchange model .",
    "the born - order quark interchange model approximates hadron - hadron scattering as due to a single interaction of the standard quark - model interaction hamiltonian @xmath51 between all constituent pairs in different hadrons @xcite . in the current study",
    "we specialize to quark interactions that are simple potentials times spin and color factors , @xmath52 the potentials are the standard quark model color coulomb , linear confinement , and oge spin - spin hyperfine terms , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "( the gaussian - regularized delta function is @xmath56 . )",
    "since this hamiltonian is @xmath57 in color space , quark line rearrangement is required to give nonzero scattering amplitudes between initial and final color - singlet hadrons at leading order in @xmath51 . in the case of @xmath17 meson - meson scattering ,",
    "this born - order amplitude is given by the sum of the four  quark born diagrams \" shown in fig.1 .",
    "each interaction in each diagram has an associated  signature \" fermion permutation phase , color factor @xmath58 , spin matrix element @xmath59 , and a spatial overlap integral @xmath60 .",
    "the evaluation of these various factors is discussed in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "there are several simplifications in @xmath17 meson - meson scattering ; the signature phase is always @xmath61 , the flavor factor is diagram independent ( and is unity here ) , and the color factors are @xmath62 ( capture ) and @xmath63 ( transfer ) .",
    "the full meson - meson @xmath64-matrix is given by the sum of color coulomb , linear confinement and oge spin - spin @xmath64-matrix elements , each of the form @xmath65 @xmath66 the angle brackets refer to the fact that the spin- and space - matrix elements do not always factor , and must in general be evaluated using a clebsch - gordon series .",
    "( this complication applies to spin - triplet , orbitally - excited mesons . ) to evaluate the cross section for a given reaction at a given energy , we first evaluate the overlap integrals ( given below ) for each set of orbital magnetic quantum numbers , @xmath67 , so the overlap integrals are functions of @xmath68 .",
    "( the magnitudes of @xmath69 and @xmath70 are determined from @xmath71 and the physical meson masses using relativistic kinematics . )",
    "we then evaluate spherical harmonic moments @xmath72 of the overlap integrals , for each diagram and interaction , usually up to @xmath73 .",
    "these spatial overlap integrals are then combined with the spin matrix elements @xmath74 in a clebsch - gordon series to form the full t - matrix element @xmath75 and the unpolarized cross sections given here are determined by summing over magnetic quantum numbers as usual .",

    "prior \" formalism . ]    since our @xmath51 consists of simple potentials , it is convenient to evaluate the overlap integrals in real space .",
    "( in most recent studies we evaluated these overlap integrals in momentum space , since they can be conveniently expressed as convolutions of the quark - quark momentum - space @xmath64-matrix with external meson wavefunctions ; see for example ref.@xcite .",
    "the real - space overlap integrals , which may be obtained by introducing fourier transforms in eqs.(1 - 4 ) of ref.@xcite for the special case @xmath76 , are    @xmath77    @xmath78    @xmath79    @xmath80    @xmath81    @xmath82    @xmath83    @xmath84    where the measure is @xmath85 .",
    "we also introduced @xmath86 , and the identities @xmath87 and @xmath88 were used in deriving the overlap integrals ; these relations are valid for processes of the type @xmath89 .",
    "the spatial wavefunctions above are the usual nonrelativistic quark potential model functions @xmath90 , normalized to @xmath91 .",
    "the wavefunctions employed in this paper to evaluate these overlap integrals are numerically determined eigenfunctions of the full quark model hamiltonian ( with interaction given by eq.(1 ) ) .",
    "since we use relativistic phase space and physical masses in evaluating our cross sections , there is a post - prior ambiguity in our results @xcite .",

    "prior \" form , in which the @xmath51 interaction takes place prior to rearrangement ( fig.1 ) . in the ",
    "post \" form , rearrangement followed by interaction , the scattering amplitude is given by a different set of spin matrix elements and overlap integrals .",
    "the post overlap integrals for the two capture diagrams are    @xmath92    @xmath93    @xmath94    @xmath95    the transfer diagrams t1 and t2 ( fig.1 ) in post and prior formalisms are identical .",
    "we have obtained born - order quark - model results for _ i _ ) dissociation cross sections of ground - state and excited charmonia into exclusive final states , and _ ii _ ) total inelastic dissociation cross sections from the quark interchange mechanism .",
    "these results assume the quark interchange model described in the previous section . in the quark model hamiltonian",
    "we assume a quark - gluon coupling constant @xmath96 , @xmath97  gev in the spin - spin hyperfine term and a string tension of @xmath98 in the linear confinement term .",
    "the light and charmed quark masses are taken to be 0.33 gev and 1.6 gev , respectively .",
    "these parameters can reproduce the @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101-wave experimental phase shifts @xcite , and are used in the following subsections to calculate charmonium dissociation cross sections which are average values obtained with `` prior '' and `` post '' forms .",
    "cross sections for @xmath102 scattering are presented in the following sections , other pion cross sections may be obtained assuming isospin symmetry .      the principal mechanism for production of charmonia at small-@xmath103 in heavy ion collisions is thought to be the two - gluon fusion process @xmath104 .",
    "one therefore expects @xmath0 production to be relatively weak , since the formation of c=(@xmath105 ) states requires an additional gluon .",
    "the c=(+ ) mesons that have especially large @xmath106 couplings , such as @xmath107 , @xmath108 and ( to a lesser extent ) @xmath109 and their , as yet unidentified , radial excitations should be the dominant @xmath6 states produced .",
    "the relative strengths of @xmath6 couplings to glue are dramatically illustrated by the total widths of charmonia ; the @xmath107 and @xmath108 total widths , thought to be due mainly to @xmath110 , are two orders of magnitude larger than the @xmath0 total width .",
    "even the smaller @xmath109 width is roughly @xmath111 times the @xmath0 width .",
    "this suggests that the production of charmonia from a quark gluon plasma is probably dominated by these c=(+ ) states rather than @xmath0 , so the evolution of c=(+ ) states produced in a heavy - ion collision may be more important for understanding charm production than the @xmath0 .",
    "the possibility that much of the @xmath0 signal originates from radiative transitions of parent @xmath112 states @xcite also suggests that an understanding of the interactions of these c=(+ ) and excited @xmath6 states with light hadrons may be of great importance for simulations of heavy flavor production in heavy ion collisions .",
    "it is straightforward to determine the dissociation cross sections of @xmath6 states other than the @xmath0 in the quark interchange model ; one simply changes the external state attached to each of the four scattering diagrams of fig.1 .",
    "there is a technical complication with spin - triplet , orbitally - excited charmonia , since the spin and space degrees of freedom do not factor trivially in these states , unlike the scattering of s - wave mesons considered previously @xcite .",
    "instead we must evaluate overlap integrals and spin matrix elements for each set of magnetic quantum numbers , which are then combined using the appropriate clebsch - gordon coefficients to give scattering amplitudes of mesons with definite @xmath113 ( e.g. @xmath114 ) .",

    "the total inelastic cross sections to 4.5 gev are shown in figs.2 - 8 .",
    "results for exclusive reactions are as shown in the figures .",
    "the total cross section also includes charge conjugation final states where appropriate .",
    "we note the following general features of the cross sections .",
    "all cross sections rise rapidly according to threshold kinematics and subsequently fall off at a scale of @xmath145 as expected for exclusive flavor exchange reactions .",
    "the @xmath50 cross sections are roughly ten times larger than corresponding @xmath146 cross sections .",
    "this is in accord with the ratio @xmath147 and the notion that cross sections increase with hadron size , although we stress that _ no simple scaling relationship exists in the quark interchange model_. we note that the ratio of @xmath50 to @xmath146 is substantially smaller than the factor of 5000 predicted by the peskin - bhanot computation @xcite .",
    "the @xmath50 cross sections tend to fall more rapidly than those for @xmath146 .",
    "we suspect that this is due to the node in the @xmath50 radial wavefunction which manifests itself as a zero in the cross section about 200 mev above threshold , causing the cross section to drop more rapidly than that for the ground state .",
    "again , this feature can be expected to be quite general .",
    "finally , we note that the @xmath112 cross sections grow with angular momentum @xmath113 , which is naively expected due to the increasing number of @xmath148 states present .",
    "a simple parameterization of these cross sections may prove useful for further numerical investigations .",
    "we have found that it is possible to fit many of our numerical cross sections with a simple functional form which is motivated by the expected threshold behavior with an exponential decay representing suppression due to flavor exchange :    @xmath149    where @xmath150 and @xmath151 for endothermic reactions and @xmath152 for exothermic reactions .",
    "here @xmath153 refers to the minimum possible value for the total orbital angular momentum of the final state consistent with conservation of angular momentum and parity .",
    "one expects this to dominate the threshold behavior of a given reaction . in practice",
    "we do find that many cross sections are well described by assuming that the orbital angular momentum in the initial channel is zero , however in general many waves contribute and it is more convenient to simply fit the value of @xmath154 .",
    "we have found that this procedure describes all of our @xmath155 reactions quite well ( however , this is not true for @xmath156 ) .",
    "results for the parameters @xmath154 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 are presented in the table  i. the @xmath159 and @xmath160 referred to in the column headings represent the @xmath161 and @xmath162 states respectively .",
    "all channels except @xmath163 include charge conjugate reactions in the fit parameters .",
    ".cross section fit parameters [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "total charmonium dissociation cross sections have been computed up to 4.5 gev in the center of mass of the @xmath155 system .",
    "the computations employ standard constituent quark model dynamics and all parameters are fixed by spectroscopic data .",
    "exact numerical wavefunctions have been employed in the computations to minimize post - prior discrepancy .",
    "we have also presented results for positive charge conjugation @xmath112 dissociation .",
    "gluon fusion arguments indicate that these states should be preferentially produced over negative charge conjugation states in small-@xmath103 heavy ion collisions .",
    "it is of interest to speculate on the high energy limit of these quark model cross sections .",
    "it is apparent from the figures that the cross sections we find for channels that open at higher energies decrease in scale as the channel threshold increases .",
    "this is expected since the higher channels have a larger momentum mismatch with the initial state .",
    "thus , exchanged quarks must probe the higher momentum region of the initial hadronic wavefunctions .",
    "this implies that the peaks of high mass channels will be approximately exponentially suppressed in e@xmath164 , due to wavefunction suppression of the amplitudes .",
    "we note that final state hadronic wavefunctions do not affect this argument , since they are effectively averaged over all length scales near threshold .",
    "furthermore , uncertainties due to relativistic effects or higher fock state components will not change the argument as long as the momentum transfer probes the confinement region of the wavefunctions .",
    "uncertainties in the structure of the pion arising from nonperturbative spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking effects are also unimportant here , since the well - understood charmonium wavefunctions alone suffice to give these general cross section features .",
    "finally , we note that there is an additional suppression due to the nodal structure of highly excited wavefunctions .",
    "once the scattering energy is large enough to probe the coulombic region of the hadronic wavefunction we expect to find a power - law suppression of the cross section peak rather than an exponential suppression .",
    "this power law is further weakened by the nodal suppression mentioned above .",
    "we stress that exclusive cross section peaks must still fall rapidly , even in this perturbative regime .    for two - to - two scattering the behavior of inclusive cross sections",
    "depends on the general behavior noted above and the density of states , which gives the rate at which new channels open with increasing @xmath71 .",
    "quark models suggest that the density of @xmath17 resonances grows as a power of mass , thus the total dissociation cross sections must decrease roughly exponentially while in the confinement regime , and thereafter as a power in the perturbative regime . at very high energies",
    "the gluonic flux tube may be excited , leading to an exponential increase in the density of states @xcite since the flux tube contains infinitely many degrees of freedom . however , wavefunction suppression will again be exponential due to severe suppression of amplitudes containing multiply - excited string modes with ground state string configurations .",
    "thus , for the case of two - body to two - body inclusive flavor - exchange scattering , nonperturbative effects can not be ignored , and the cross section should decrease with increasing center of mass energy .",
    "the constituent quark model provides a microscopic foundation for the exploration of hadronic interactions at low energy .",
    "thus all relevant reactions may be computed with the addition of no new parameters .",
    "this stands in contrast to effective models which must introduce new couplings and form factors , and which suffer from confusion over the correct degrees of freedom and dynamics to be employed ( there are no obvious symmetries to guide the construction of effective lagrangians in this energy regime ) .",
    "sum rule and pqcd computations similarly suffer from the notoriously poor convergence properties of qcd ( as exemplified in renormalon ambiguities ) and from the difficulty in extracting observables from condensates .",
    "we regard the constituent quark model as the most reliable tool for the investigation of these issues and in future plan to apply it to charmonium - nucleon scattering and other reactions of interest to rhic .",

    "<S> the dissociation cross sections of several c=(+ ) charmonia may be of considerable importance for the study of heavy ion collisions , since these states are expected to be produced more copiously than the @xmath0 . the relative importance of the productions of ground - state and orbitally - excited charmed mesons in a pion - charmonium collision is demonstrated through the @xmath1-dependent charmonium dissociation cross sections . </S>"
