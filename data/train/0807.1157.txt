    "disorder in graphene may have various sources , and the understanding of its role in transport properties is still incomplete.@xcite    in this paper we focus on the effect of the random potential at the interface of the junction .",
    "the reason is that current inside either region 1 or region 2 is carried by quantum hall edge states,@xcite thus immune to most disorder inside either region , while scattering among states at the interface of the two regions contributes to the major effect of disorder on the overall conductance .",

    "each situation , that is , each experimental condition under which measurements are made , is identified with a specified combination of @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , while various configurations of disorder are subject to some self - averaging process in each measurement .",

    "the plateaus described by eq . in the bipolar regime and described by eq . in the unipolar regime are the signature of the quantum hall effect in a single graphene junction , williams07sci though in some cases the accuracy of the plateau is poor in the experimental data,@xcite compared with the expected value . by taking into account disorder in the junction interface area and a self - averaging process in the measurement",
    ", our calculations clearly produce these plateaus .",
    "in addition , the lack of the accuracy of the plateau height is attached to the strength of the disorder , and is reflected in the variance of the transmission functions .",
    "the experimentally observed conductance plateaus of a bipolar graphene junction in the quantum hall regime have been explained as the result of the complete mixing of quantum hall edge states at the junction interface due to scattering , and the departures of the experimental data from eq .",
    "have been attributed to the incomplete mixing of edge states.@xcite we emphasize here that because the spin - flip process is negligible in this system , the mode mixing can only happen among states of the same spin quantum number .",
    "thus to correctly express @xmath57 and var(@xmath42 ) in terms of the filling factors @xmath59 and @xmath5 , the filling factors must be spinless , with the spin degree of freedom included as an extra multiplier to @xmath42 .",
    "such expressions , compared with the expressions using the spinful filling factors @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath60 ... ,@xcite show no quantitative difference as for @xmath57 , but significant differences as for var(@xmath42 ) .",
    "the disorder dependence of the transmission functions with specific combinations of filling factors in the bipolar regime is shown in fig .",
    "fig : diff_disorder_np .",
    "the shadowed region ( roughly @xmath61 ) is where complete mode mixing happens in all three cases , i.e. @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the averaged transmission functions develop into plateaus of height described by eq . simultaneously in this region , and the ensemble variances of the transmission functions also develop into plateaus predicted by eq . .",
    "in the language of the rmt,@xcite the ensembles of scattering matrices @xmath64 ( of a specific spin quantum number ) under these circumstances are the circular unitary ensembles ( cues ) , that is , @xmath64 matrices in these ensembles are uniformly distributed over the unitary group @xmath65 .",
    "average over the cue is equal to an integration over the unitary group . and",
    "it is this integration that lead to the `` universal '' value of the averaged transmission function eq . , and the universal conductance fluctuation ( ucf ) given by eq . .",
    "the graphene bipolar junctions in this disorder regime ( shadowed ) are nearly ideal realizations of the quantum chaotic cavities characterized by eq . and .",
    "the ensemble of @xmath64 matrices , however , is actually dependent on the disorder strength @xmath66 , which represents how much the scattering potential can be varied from one sample to another . in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff_disorder_np ] we see that to the left of the shadowed region ( roughly @xmath67 ) , both @xmath68 and var(@xmath42 ) deviate from eq . and with decreased @xmath66 , indicating the deviation of the actual ensembles of @xmath64 matrices from the cues .",
    "in other words , these are the cases of incomplete mode mixing .",
    "notably , when @xmath69 there is an extended range of @xmath66 where the plateau of @xmath70 is preserved .",
    "this is easily understood as there are only two modes to be mixed in this case . when the disorder at the junction interface is larger than the range of the shadowed region in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff_disorder_np ] , on the other hand , the conducting edge modes in either region 1 or region 2 are expelled from the junction interface area gradually , scattering between modes from one side of the junction to the other is weak , both @xmath71 and var(@xmath42 ) decrease until the whole junction is `` cut off '' .",
    "this is the case of what we see in the large-@xmath66 regime of fig .",

    "the inset shows the corresponding variance of @xmath42 .",
    "the regime is shadowed where all plateaus of @xmath71 are preserved.,scaledwidth=38.0% ]    compared with the bipolar junctions , transport in a unipolar junction with disordered junction interface has a more straightforward picture .",
    "the conductance of a unipolar junction is mainly contributed from the compatible edge modes in the two regions , and the tunneling of carriers from one region to another mainly happens near the lateral edges .",
    "the disorder at the interface impedes the coupling of these modes to reduce the transmission through the junction , which is contrary to the bipolar cases .",
    "the calculated @xmath70 and var(@xmath42 ) in the unipolar regime are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff_disorder_nn ] with different combinations of filling factors . in each case",
    "@xmath72 exhibits a quantized plateau when the disorder is weak ( shadowed ) , and starts to deviate from the plateau at a critical value of the disorder strength where var(@xmath42 ) also begins to deviate from zero .",
    "we notice that the shadowed regions in fig .",
    "fig : diff_disorder_np and [ fig : diff_disorder_nn ] do not overlap over the range of @xmath66 , which implies that @xmath72 do not develop into plateaus simultaneously in the bipolar regime and the unipolar regime , especially when the filling factors are large .",
    "this fact highlights the opposite roles the disorder plays in the formation of conductance plateaus in the bipolar and the unipolar junctions .",
    "it stabilizes the plateaus in the bipolar case when its intensity is in a certain nonzero range , while it tends to destroy the plateaus in the unipolar case at the same time , though in the limit of strong disorder electrons will be blocked from tunneling through the junction in both cases .",
    "the character of the quantized transport in these junctions can be experimentally identified by measuring the electron shot noise.blanter00 the fano factor , defined as the ratio of the actual shot noise to the poisson noise , is extracted from our simulation using the equation @xmath73 , where the summations are taken over different transmission eigenvalues indexed by @xmath74 .",
    "it is found that the fano factors corresponding to the conductance plateaus in the unipolar regime are identically zero , as expected from the dissipationless transport via the quantum hall edge modes . in the bipolar regime ,",
    "the fano factors develop into plateaus described by @xmath75corresponding to the plateaus of @xmath57 , as shown in fig .",
    "fig : fanofactors .",
    "is again a straightforward outcome of the rmt applied to a quantum chaotic cavity with few transmission modes.savin06 it is quantitatively different from the fano factors discussed in reference @xcite , especially when the number of the transmission modes is small . and",
    "this is a key to examine experimentally the existence of the ucf revealed in our simulation .",
    "before ending this paper we address the issues on the sources and types of disorder in graphene which is relevant to this study .",
    "the experimentally observed conductance plateaus were explained as a result of the full mixing of these quantum hall edge modes.@xcite the details of the mode mixing are determined by the form of the disorder and in turn provide information about the disorder therein .",
    "the quantum hall edge modes in a graphene strip can be indexed by two quantum numbers , spin and valley isospin,@xcite besides the landau levels they belong to .",
    "thus the mechanism of the mode mixing inevitably involves the presence of spin - flip scattering and/or intervalley scattering . considering the negligible magnetic impurities and spin - related interaction in the current graphene samples , and ignoring the magnetic edge states reported in some specific graphene ribbons,@xcite ,",
    "we assume the absence of spin - flip scattering in this study , and use the `` spinless '' filling factors @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( @xmath76 ) in our expressions.@xcite the presence of intervalley scattering among the quantum hall edge modes in the graphene p - n junctions , however , is still a question .",
    "previous works on the disorder effects in graphene p - n junctions generally assumed weak intervalley scattering , and discussed the valley - isospin dependence of the conductance.@xcite for example , in the work by tworzydo _",
    "et al._,@xcite it was assumed that each impurity has the gaussian potential profile @xmath77 of range @xmath78 and random height @xmath79 .",
    "a large @xmath78 implies a long range of the disorder potential which suppresses the intervalley scattering , while a small @xmath80 implies @xmath81-function - like disorder potential which provokes the intervalley scattering .",
    "the former case was studied but the plateaus observed in the experiments were not properly recovered .",
    "that is the reason why we choose the latter case as our starting point in this work , though the origin of the short - range disorder potential is not completely understood .",
    "it turns out our calculations do produce the reported conductance plateaus as in eq .",
    ", as well as quantities like the fano factors as in eq . that can be further examined experimentally .",
    "still it is interesting to investigate the crossover effects between long - range disorder potential and short - range disorder potential in the junctions , and the results would possibly explain the not - fully - developed conductance plateaus in the experiments.@xcite this investigation will be a subject of our later work .",
    "furthermore , there also exist other forms of disorder that can not be described by random local potential,@xcite .",
    "for example , effective gauge fields can be induced by ripples , topological lattice defects , strains , or curvatures _ etc .",
    "_ in the graphene sample , and will affect the landau levels , especially the lowest one.@xcite we believe that these various forms of disorder will affect the behavior of the edge - mode mixing in various manners , but this is out of the scope of the current work .    in short , our numerical simulation of the quantum hall effect in graphene p - n junctions has reproduced the quantized conductance plateaus observed in the experiment .",
    "the ucf and quantized values of the fano factors are found to be accompanying the conductance plateaus in the bipolar regime , which is well explained by the rmt of quantum transport .",
    "the bipolar graphene junction in the quantum hall regime mimics an ideal quantum chaotic cavity , which is another example of the extraordinary transport character of graphene .",
    "this work was supported by the research grant council of hong kong under grant no .",
    ": hku 7041/07p . after we completed the present work we were aware of a similar work by w. long _ et al._.@xcite",
    "in this appendix , we derive eqs . , , and using the random matrix theory",
    ".    random matrix theory of quantum transport is based on the assumption that the scattering matrix @xmath64 of a chaotic cavity is uniformly distributed over a specific group ( the so - called circular ensemble ) determined by the symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "basically there are three classes of the groups.@xcite if time - reversal symmetry is broken ( @xmath82 ) , @xmath64 is only constrained by unitarity , which is a result of current conservation , thus @xmath64 belongs to a unitary group .",
    "if time - reversal symmetry is preserved together with the presence of spin - rotation symmetry ( @xmath83 ) , then @xmath64 is both unitary and symmetric : @xmath84 , where the superscript @xmath42 indicates the transpose of the matrix , this leads to an orthogonal group .",
    "if time - reversal symmetry is preserved but spin - rotation symmetry is broken ( @xmath85 ) , which is the case when spin - orbit interaction is present , then @xmath64 is unitary and self - dual : @xmath86 , where the superscript @xmath87 indicates the dual of a quaternion matrix , the group is called symplectic .    in random matrix theory , the statistics of transport properties is obtained from the statistics of an appropriate circular ensemble .",
    "for example , the mean of the transmission probability @xmath88 is given by @xmath89where @xmath74 and @xmath90 stand for transmission eigen - channels .",
    "we will omit the mathematical details of formulating the measure @xmath91 in a group space that @xmath64 belongs to , and use the following two equations as being established:@xcite @xmath92@xmath93where @xmath94 is an @xmath95@xmath96@xmath95 unitary matrix belonging to the circular unitary ensemble ( cue ) . since the system we are going to discuss only involves the cue",
    ", we will drop this notation hereafter .    starting from these equations ,",
    "the conductance @xmath97 , its fluctuation var(@xmath98 ) , and the fano factor @xmath99 for the fully - mixed quantum hall edge transport in a graphene p - n junction can be readily calculated .",
    "we first assume no spin - flip scattering is allowed , so that @xmath64 matrix for each spin component is unitary by itself , the case including spin - flip scattering will be discussed in what follows .",
    "suppose there are @xmath100@xmath101 and @xmath100@xmath102 edge states ( they are also eigen - channels away from the junction area ) at the two sides of the junction , respectively , the full @xmath64 matrix is of dimension @xmath103 , but it is divided into two uncoupled spin subspaces in the absence of spin - flip scattering , therefore matrices in the cue are only of dimension @xmath104 in terms of each spin subspace .",
    "also the strict spin degeneracy implies that @xmath105 . regarding this we have @xmath106@xmath107}\\left ( \\frac{e^{2}}{h}\\right ) ^{2}.\\end{aligned}\\]]the fano factor @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the transmission submatrix of @xmath64,@xcite and @xmath110 is nothing but @xmath111 .",
    "thus @xmath112 in this way we have derived the formulae expressed in eqs . , , and in the framework of the random matrix theory .",
    "in contrast to the spin - conserved scattering case , the mixing among different spin modes will lead to quantitatively different variance and fano factors , while leaving the conductance mean unchanged . in the random matrix theory ,",
    "this is derived as following .",
    "still suppose there are @xmath100@xmath101 and @xmath100@xmath102 edge states at the two sides of the junction respectively , the full @xmath64 matrix is still of dimension @xmath103 , but the spin - off - diagonal parts are now non - zero , and the @xmath64 matrix is unitary only as a whole .",

    "except for a coincident equivalence of the mean values of the conductance @xmath116 , the quantitative differences of the ucf @xmath117 and the fano factors @xmath99 between two cases , namely whether scattering is spin - conserved or not , are obvious , especially when the values of @xmath101 and @xmath102 are small .",
