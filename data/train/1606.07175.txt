    "the standard model ( sm ) is not invariant under p nor cp transformation .",
    "strangely , one of the renormalizable , cp violating terms , @xmath2 , exists only with an undetectably small coefficient ( @xmath3 ) or even is missing in the sm , where @xmath4 is the gluon field strength tensor and @xmath5 .",
    "this unnatural situation is referred to as strong cp problem . besides the solution with the vanishing up quark mass , the peccei - quinn ( pq ) mechanism has been known to provide an elegant explanation  @xcite . in the pq mechanism , a complex scalar field with a @xmath6 symmetry",
    "is introduced .",
    "after the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the @xmath6 symmetry at very high temperature , the radial component of the pq field acquires the vacuum expectation value , @xmath7 , and the angular component , called axion @xmath8 , emerges as nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson .",
    "one can rotate away the leading interaction of the axion to quarks by the @xmath6 chiral transformation of quark fields , and then the coefficient of the @xmath9 term in the sm , @xmath10 , is replaced by @xmath11 . due to the periodicity of the moduli of the axion field",
    ", the effective potential of the axion field takes the form like @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the qcd topological susceptibility .",
    "this form leads to two important consequences .",
    "one is that the cp conserving vacuum ( _ i.e. _ @xmath14 ) is automatically chosen at low enough temperature , thus the strong cp problem is gone ( pq mechanism ) .",
    "the other is that the temperature dependent axion mass is given by the qcd topological susceptibility ( and @xmath7 ) as @xmath15 .",
    "the pq mechanism is attractive because it also provides a candidate for the dark matter of the universe through the misalignment mechanism for the axion generation  @xcite .",
    "the axion abundance of the present universe is determined by two ingredients : the axion mass as a function of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and the misalignment at @xmath18 , @xmath19 , where the axion starts coherent oscillation . in the estimate of @xmath13 at finite temperature , the instanton picture is widely adopted  @xcite and predicts @xmath20 gev  @xcite , where @xmath21 mev is the ( pseudo-)critical temperature for chiral symmetry breaking in qcd .",
    "however , the instanton calculus is based on the perturbation theory , and hence the reliability is not very clear around @xmath22 gev .",
    "furthermore , the possibility that , in two flavor qcd , @xmath13 behaves like a step function at @xmath23 when the quarks are sufficiently light is argued based on reasonable assumptions @xcite ( see also a clarification in ref .",
    "in such a case , a significant enhancement of the axion abundance is predicted , and even excludes the standard axion scenario if @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of lattice qcd can unambiguously determine @xmath0 in principle .",
    "the study of @xmath13 at high temperature like @xmath25 or higher began in the @xmath26 yang - mills theory  @xcite . recently , full qcd results were reported  @xcite .",
    "several remarks are as follows .",
    "first , the lattice calculations of @xmath0 in the @xmath26 yang - mills theory shows @xmath27 with @xmath28 , which is compatible with @xmath29 in the instanton calculus  @xcite .",
    "secondly , one of the full qcd calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite finds @xmath30 , which disagrees with @xmath31 in the instanton calculus , while @xmath31 is reported in ref .",
    "thirdly , @xmath32 rapidly decreases with @xmath16 , where @xmath33 represents the four dimensional volume , and importantly existing lattice methods fail when @xmath34 . since @xmath35 is realized above a certain temperature before reaching @xmath36 , the axion abundance becomes uncertain .",
    "thus , methods overcoming this difficulty are desired .    to be specific , in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath0 is calculated on @xmath37 lattices in the quenched approximation with one of the standard methods counting the fermionic zero modes , @xmath38 is estimated to be 0.35 , 0.09 , 0.03 at @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , respectively , and no reliable estimate is given above @xmath42 .    in the present paper , we propose a novel method to determine the temperature dependence of @xmath0 at high temperature .",
    "the method involves estimating the difference of the gauge action and the chiral condensate between two different topological sectors . in order to see how well the proposed method works ,",

    "<S> qcd topological susceptibility at high temperature , @xmath0 , provides an important input for the estimate of the axion abundance in the present universe . </S>",
    "<S> while the model independent determination of @xmath0 should be possible from the first principles using lattice qcd , existing methods fail at high temperature , since not only the probability that non - trivial topological sectors appear in the configuration generation process but also the local topological fluctuations get strongly suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a novel method to calculate the temperature dependence of topological susceptibility at high temperature . a feasibility test is performed on a small lattice in the quenched approximation , and the results </S>",
    "<S> are compared with the prediction of the dilute instanton gas approximation . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the method works well especially at very high temperature and the result is consistent with the instanton calculus down to @xmath1 within the statistical uncertainty . </S>"
