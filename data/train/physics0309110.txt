    "in this study we have dated two human fossil remains found in romania , by the method of radiocarbon dating using the accelerator mass spectrometry ( ams ) technique , performed at the pelletron accelerator in lund university , sweden .",
    "these are the most ancient dated human fossil remains from romania , attributed by some archaeologists to the upper paleolithic , the aurignacian period .",
    "the first skull , and scapulum and tibia remains were found in 1952 in baia de fier , in the woman s cave , in hateg , gorj county in the province oltenia , by constantin nicolaescu - plopsor .",
    "another skull was found in cioclovina cave , near commune bosorod , hunedoara county in transylvania , found by a worker at the exploitation of phosphate deposits , in the year 1941 .",
    "the skull arrived at francisc rainer , anthropologist , and ioan simionescu , geologist , who published a study of this skull.@xcite the absence of stratigraphical observation information made the cultural and chronological attribution of these skulls very difficult , and a number of archaeologists questioned the paleolithic character of these fossil remains . for this reason ,",
    "the dating of the two skulls by a physical analysis is decisive .",
    "samples of bone were taken from the scapulum and tibia remains from the woman s cave , from baia de fier , and from the skull from the cioclovina cave .",
    "the @xmath1c content was determined in the two samples by using the ams system at lund university .",
    "normally , sufficient collagen for ams measurements can be extracted from bone fragments with masses of 1 g , or more provided that at least 5 to 10% of the original collagen content is present .",
    "but for the presently studied bone remains , because of the small available quantity of very old bone samples , the determination of the radiocarbon content in the bones was difficult .",
    "we have essentially applied the longin method @xcite for the extraction of _ collagen _ from the bone structure .",
    "we use the _ collagen _ to refer to collagen that has undergone a degree of diagenesis .",
    "the next step is the transformation of the _ collagen _ into pure carbon in an experimental set - up for the preparation of samples for ams technique @xcite .",
    "the pure carbon , placed in a copper holder , is arranged in a wheel , together with two standards of oxalic acid and one anthracite background sample .",
    "the wheel with the samples and standards is put into the ion source of the accelerator .",
    "the central part of the lund ams system is a pelletron tandem accelerator .",
    "the accelerator is run at a terminal voltage of 2.4 mv during ams experiments .",
    "the particle identification and measuring system consists of a silicon surface barrier detector of diameter of 25 mm .",
    "the computer system alternately analyses the data of the @xmath2c current received from a current integrator and the @xmath1c counts arriving from the particle detector , to obtain , finally , the ratio @xmath1c/@xmath2c for each sample .",
    "each sample is measured 7 times .",
    "the precision of the measurements for samples close to modern @xcite is around 1 % @xcite .",
    "dating of the two sampes by the ams - technique gave the following results : +"
