    "we study the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies measured by wmap @xcite from the point of view of the 3-point angular correlation @xmath17 .",
    "current models for structure formation predict that the initial seeds , that later give rise to the observed structure in the universe , were gaussian . if so , one would expect the angular 3-point cmb temperature correlations to be almost zero . even for a gaussian field ,",
    "any non - linear processing of the primordial perturbations would lead to small non - gaussianities . for an excellent review see @xcite and references therein .",
    "angular correlations have some advantages over spherical harmonic analyses .",
    "the main disadvantage is that different angular bins are highly correlated , which means that we need to use the full covariance matrix to assess the significance of any departures between measurements and models .",
    "the advantage of using the n - point function is that correlations can be easily sampled from any region of the sky , even when a foreground mask is required , provided the region is large enough . in comparison , harmonic decomposition breaks the angular symmetry in the sky into orthogonal bases which have an arbitrary phase orientation .",
    "this is not a problem in the case of full sky coverage , but the results will be coordinate - dependent if a mask is used",
    ". moreover , higher order correlations , such as the bispectrum , have to focus on some small portion of the mutidimensional space of triangle configurations ( see @xcite ) . the formal equivalence between the bispectrum and the 3-point function is hardly realized in practice and as such it is of interest to study both separately .",
    "our analysis procedure is similar to that presented in @xcite , to which the reader can refer for further details .",
    "we use the same simulations where we ve generated maps using the standard model and a low - q model , a fiducial variation of the model with low values of the quadrupole and octopole .",
    "we concentrate our analysis on the v - band wmap maps ( fwhm = 21 at 61ghz ) generated using healpix @xcite with pixel resolution n=512 ( 7 pixels ) and to which we apply the conservative wmap kp0 foreground mask @xcite , the resulting maps have approximately 2.4 million pixels .",
    "the 2-point angular correlation function is defined as the expectation value or mean cross - correlation of temperature fluctuations : ( ) at two positions @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the sky : w_2 ( ) , where @xmath20 , assuming that the distribution is statistically isotropic .",
    "we normalize fluctuations to be dimensionless , @xmath21k , or dimensional with @xmath22 . to estimate @xmath23 from the pixel maps we use : w_2 ( ) = _ i , j _ i _ j  w_i  w_j , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the observed temperature fluctuations on the sky and the sum extends to all pairs @xmath26 separated by @xmath27 .",
    "the mean temperature fluctuation is subtracted so that @xmath28 .",
    "the weights @xmath29 can be used to minimize the variance when the pixel noise is not uniform , however this introduces larger cosmic variance . here",
    "we follow the wmap team and use uniform weights ( i.e. @xmath30 ) . at the largest scales we use bins @xmath31 whose size is proportional to the square root of the angle @xmath32 and use linear bins of @xmath33 degrees at the smallest scales .      in a similar fashion , the 3-point angular correlation function is defined as the cross - correlation of temperature fluctuations at 3 positions @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath34 on the sky : w_3(_12 , _ 13 , _ 23 ) , where @xmath35 .",
    "consider a triplet of pixels with labels 1,2,3 on the sky .",
    "let @xmath36 and @xmath37 be the angular separations between the corresponding pairs of pixels and @xmath38 the interior angle between these two sides of the triangle .",
    "assuming that the distribution is statistically isotropic , @xmath17 only depends on the sides of the triangles that define the 3 positions on the sky .",
    "one can characterize the configuration - dependence of the three - point function by studying the behavior of @xmath39 for fixed @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    to estimate @xmath40 from the pixel maps we use : w_3(_12 , _ 13 , _ 23 ) = _ i , j , k _ i _ j _ k",
    "w_i  w_j  w_k , where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath41 are the temperature differences in the map and the sum extends to all triplets separated by @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we use same bins and weights as in the 2-point function above .",
    "the 3-point function can either be normalized to a dimensionless amplitude :    d_3 where @xmath45 , or a hierarchical amplitude :    q_3 .",
    "the covariance matrix between different angular bins can be calculated from the simulations : c_ij & & w_2(_i )  w_2(_j ) + & = & 1 _ l=1^n w_2^l(_i ) w_2^l(_j ) , where @xmath46 . here",
    "@xmath47 is the 2-point or 3-point function measured in the @xmath48-th realization ( @xmath49 ) and @xmath50 is the mean value for the @xmath51 realizations .",
    "the case @xmath52 gives the error variance : @xmath53 .",
    "an estimate of the errors for correlations measured on the real sky can be obtained using a variation of the jackknife error scheme .",
    "this has the potential advantage of producing an error estimate which is model independent .",
    "the accuracy of the jack - knife covariance have been tested for both wmap @xcite and the apm and sdss survey @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in the estimation ,",
    "the sample is first divided into @xmath54 separate regions on the sky , each of equal area . the analysis is then performed @xmath54 times , on each occasion removing a different region .",
    "these are called the ( jackknife ) subsamples , which we label @xmath55 .",
    "the estimated statistical covariance for @xmath56 at scales @xmath57 and @xmath58 is then given by : c_ij & = & m-1 _ k=1^m w_2^k(_i ) w_2^k(_j ) + & & w_2^k(_i ) w_2^k(_i ) - ( _ i ) where @xmath59 is the measure 2 or 3-point function in the @xmath60-th subsample ( @xmath61 ) and @xmath62 is the mean value for the @xmath54 subsamples .",
    "the case @xmath52 gives the error variance .",
    "note how , if we increase the number of regions @xmath54 , the jackknife subsamples are larger and each term in the sum is smaller .",
    "we typically take @xmath63 corresponding to a division of the sphere into 8 octants .",
    "note that the 3-point correlation function is in general a function of 3 variables .",
    "we will fix two of these variables and show variations of @xmath17 or @xmath6 as a function of a single variable , for which we estimate the covariance with the above prescription .",
    "estimation of correlations in configuration space is quite time consuming .",
    "a brute force algorithm to estimate all pair separations in a map with @xmath51 pixels takes @xmath64 operations .",
    "to do all triplets in eq.[[w3est ] ] we need @xmath65 operations . in the healpix @xmath66 wmap maps ( 7 arcmin pixel s )",
    "we have @xmath67 ( with the kp0 mask galactic cut ) so a brute force analysis requires @xmath68 operations , well beyond current computing power .",
    "we overcome this difficulty in two steps . for large scales , @xmath69 degree , we reduce the resolution of the maps to @xmath70 ( 1 degree resolution ) by averaging fluctuations over nearby pixels .",
    "the resulting correlation function contains the same information at scales larger than the new resolution scale .",
    "now the number of pixels is reduced to @xmath71 and the number of operations to @xmath72 , which lies within current computer power ( teraflops ) . for scales smaller than a few degrees",
    "we can reduce the number of operations by precalculating the distance between neighboring pixels .",
    "the number of operations is then reduced to @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the number of neighbors . in our case",
    "we have @xmath75 for pixels around @xmath76 degrees , and thus @xmath77 as in the case for the larger angles . in our implementation",
    "we have an overlap between the large and small scale estimations at around @xmath78 degrees .",
    "the agreement between both estimates here is quite good for both @xmath79 and @xmath17 . in the case of the 2-point function",
    "we have compared both estimates in the whole range @xmath80 degrees and find excellent agreement .",
    "3.3 in    3.3 in    results are presented in figures [ w3co ] and [ q3al ] . at large scales fig.[w3co ] shows the results of @xmath17 in units of @xmath81 ( eg @xmath82 in eq.[[delta ] ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath83 at small scales , so that @xmath84 in these units ( see eq.[[d3 ] ] ) .",
    "errorbars in both cases are from jackknife subsamples and agree well with errors estimated from the simulations ( see gaztaaga etal 2003 for more details ) .",
    "the results for the equilateral and collapsed triangle configurations can be compared to the cobe analysis presented in fig.1 of @xcite .",
    "the pseudo - collapsed case in @xcite would correspond here to @xmath85 here .",
    "we can see how the cobe and wmap results are in good agreement where the two curves even see the very same bumps and valleys .",
    "this is not totally surprising given the very good match between cobe and wmap temperatures maps , pixel by pixel , when smoothed on large scales .",
    "the top panel in figure [ w3co ] also shows two new triangle configurations : one that is elongated , @xmath86 ( short dashed line ) , and a wide triangle , @xmath87 ( continuous line ) .",
    "the results for intermediate angular configurations are similar . in all cases",
    "the agreement with the gaussian prediction @xmath88 is excellent , given the strong covariance .    at small scales",
    "we show the 3-point function in terms of the reduced amplitude @xmath6 in eq.[[q3 ] ] where the best constraints are found on the smallest scales . as can be seen in the figure ,",
    "as we approach triangles with side @xmath89degree , the cosmic errors become large @xmath90 .",
    "we have fit the data to a constant value of @xmath6 , independent of scale using a @xmath91-test : ^2 = _ i , j=1^n _ i   c_ij^-1   _ j , where @xmath92 is the difference between the `` observation '' @xmath93 and the @xmath94 value . in order to eliminate the degeneracies in the covariance matrix , we perform a singular value decomposition ( svd ) of the covariance matrix ( see gaztaaga 2003 for more details ) .",
    "a joint fit with the jackknife covariance matrix for collapsed configurations with @xmath95 degree , yields : q_3^collapsed = 19 141 .",
    "the best signal - to - noise is found for the non - collapsed triangle configurations with @xmath96 degree we find : q_3 = 336 218  ;   = 0.5  deg providing a marginal detection at about 90% confidence ( shown as dashed line in fig.[q3al ] ) .",
    "this fit corresponds to the jackknife covariance matrix .",
    "a similar result is found for the covariance matrix in the low - q simulations .",
    "the errors increase by almost a factor of two when using the covariance of the standard simulations .",
    "this increase is due to the larger cosmic variance introduced by the quadrupole and octopole which are larger than in the wmap data ( see @xcite , citepgaz03 for a discussion ) .",
    "our bounds on @xmath13 seem marginally better than the ones presented in @xcite from the wmap bispectrum , but a direct comparison is not straight forward .",
    "first of all , our modelling provides a measurement of non - linearities in the final @xmath107 while @xcite provide a modelling for non - linear primordial curvature perturbations @xmath14 , before radiation transfer .",
    "thus while limits on @xmath6 are model independent , direct limits on @xmath13 depend on the assumed model for radiation transfer . secondly , the bispectrum configurations used by @xcite are a subset of all possible triangle configurations so that both approaches are neither equivalent nor optimized in the same way . in both cases ,",
    "errors are dominated by cosmic variance , and they begin to be small enough to constrain the leading order non - linear effects with coupling @xmath13 which are of order unity .",
