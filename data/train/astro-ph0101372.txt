    "the power spectrum is a representation of the light curve in the frequency domain .",
    "specifically it gives the contributions to the variance in the light curve of sinusoids as a function of their frequencies .",
    "however , a significant peak in the power spectrum does necessarily correspond to a _ long - term _ ( and hence meaningful ) periodicity .",
    "after all , _ any _ light curve  including a random one  can be described in terms of its power spectrum , as all features in the time domain must appear in the frequency domain somehow .",
    "in particular , the `` ideal '' case of a pure sinusoidal light curve is only produced by a rotating star if one hemisphere is uniformly darker than the other and the star is observed along its equatorial plane .",
    "in contrast , a star with a single small surface feature ( `` spot '' ) would show a sinusoidal light curve only when the spot is on the observable hemisphere ; for up to half of the rotation ( depending on the inclination of the rotation axis ) the light curve would be constant .",
    "a star with several spots will show a more complex behaviour , due to the variable number of spots observable ( and hence modulating the light curve ) at any one time .",
    "all of these variations will be explained by apparent `` periods '' in the power spectrum , some of which may even be significant relative to the noise .    we have carried out numerous simulations to understand the appearance of the light curve and its power spectrum due to such spots .",
    "[ simul01_rot ] shows the light curve due to a single small dark spot on a star .",
    "if we rotate this star with a period of five hours and observe it with the same noise level and time sampling as one of the targets ( 2m1334 ) , we obtain the power spectrum and phased light curve in fig .  [ simul01_ps ] and fig .",
    "[ simul01_rot]c respectively .",
    "the phased light curve is not sinusoidal , yet the power spectrum detects the rotation period .     test ( @xmath361e-9 ) .",

    "the same clean parameters were used here as for the real data of section  [ results ] . see caption to fig .",

    "[ simul07_rot ] , which is due to a star with eight spots rotating with a period of ten hours . here",
    "the contrast of the individual spots is much smaller , only @xmath39 to @xmath40 magnitudes .",
    "the sampling and noise from 2m1145 ( 00 - 02 run ) is used and results in a significant variability detection according to the @xmath4 test , but with @xmath41@xmath420.005 is close to the variable / non - variable cut - off . despite this low snr ( and no detectable sinusoidal variation in fig .",
    "[ simul07_rot]c ) , the rotation period still clearly stands out in the cleaned power spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ simul07_ps ] ) .     except now for eight dark and bright spots with random phases .",
    "this gives a significant detection , although not overwhelming ( @xmath430.005 ) , yet the cleaned power spectrum ( fig .  [ simul07_ps ] ) still detects the rotation period of 10 hours.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    b. the noise level is @xmath44 .",
    "see caption to fig .",
    "[ 2m1145_9901_ps].,scaledwidth=65.0%,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we see that the light curve phased to the detected rotation period does not necessarily show sinusoidal ( or even near - sinusoidal ) variation .",
    "more extensive simulations with different numbers , amplitudes and phases of spots have been carried out . these indicate that even if the contrast of the spots ( and hence the snr ) is very low , then provided the light curve shows significant variation according to the @xmath4 test",
    ", the rotation period is seen at more than ten times the noise in the power spectrum .",
    "thus the absence of significant periods in the power spectrum for a variable light curve indicates _",
    "non - periodic _ variations over the timescale of the observations .      this non - periodic variability appears to imply one of three things :    1 .",
    "the rotation period is shorter than the time span of observations ; 2 .",
    "the rotation period is longer than the time span of observations ; 3 .",
    "the surface features which are presumed to be modulating the light curve are not stable over the time span of observations .",
    "the first of these implies a rotation period of less than 0.4 hours , which corresponds to an equatorial rotation speed of at least 240km / s .",
    "based on t@xmath45 in tables  [ detections ] and  [ nondetections ] , the second possibility requires _ maximum _",
    "@xmath32 values ( i.e.  when viewed equatorially ) of between 1 and 4km / s , assuming a radius of @xmath46 .",
    "these would be inconsistent with the measurements of basri et al.@xcite , who report @xmath32 values between 10 and 60km / s for 16 out of 17 late m and l field dwarfs .",
    "( according to models , even the youngest , warmest objects in table  [ targets ]  those in @xmath2  orionis  can have radii no larger than @xmath47 @xcite , so @xmath32 could not be above 8km / s for periods of order t@xmath45 . ) the results of basri et al .",
    "therefore imply typical rotation periods of 1 to 10 hours , and the simulations have shown that such periods would have been detected in the light curves of the present sample , _ if _ these objects had stable modulating surface features . yet",
    "some significantly variable objects show no significant periodicities . the logical explanation in these cases ( especially 2m0345 , 2m0913 , 2m1145 and calar  3 ) is , therefore , that these objects have surface features which evolve over the period of the observations , thus removing the rotational modulation from the light curve . for 2m1145",
    "we possibly have more direct evidence of this , as the two light curves from one year apart show no common periods .",
    "magnetically - induced star spots are common in solar - type stars , the magnetic field being produced by the @xmath48 dynamo .",
    "this appears not to operate in low mass stars and brown dwarfs , yet a turbulent dynamo may @xcite . however , recent observations imply that chromospheric activity  and , perhaps , the contrast of magnetic spots  decreases rapidly between spectral types m7 and l1 @xcite@xcite . in comparison ,",
    "[ amps ] shows the amplitude of variability ( or upper limit thereon ) as a function of spectral type for the sample in this paper .",
    "whereas 7/10 of objects later than m9 show variability , only 2/9 earlier than this do .",
    "( the average detection limits / amplitudes are almost identical in the two regions , so this is not an artifact . )",
    "if the variability were due to magnetic spots , then in the light of the activity decline we would expect variability to be _ less _ common among later - type objects , not _",
    "more _ common as seen here .",
    "although this could also be an age effect ( all of the targets of type m9 and earlier are cluster members with ages less than 120myr ) it hints towards a non - magnetic origin of the surface features .     rather than @xmath34",
    "as the amplitude measure is very similar.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    another candidate for producing variability is photospheric dust clouds .",
    "modelling of optical and infrared spectra show that solid particles form in late m and l dwarfs @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "while we may expect this dust to gravitationally settle below the photosphere , certain processes ( such as tubulence ) may prevent this , and models which include dust opacity ( as well as removing dust constituents from the equation of state ) give better fits to the near infrared spectra of ultra cool dwarfs @xcite .",
    "this dust could form into large - scale opaque clouds .",
    "their evolution over a few rotation periods could account for the variability reported in this paper , possibly driven by rapid rotation and turbulence .",
    "the clouds would have to be relatively large , as many small clouds evolving independently would have an insignificant net effect on the light curve . as more dust",
    "can form in cooler objects , we may expect more variability in later - type objects , as seen in fig .",
    "however , given the small amount of data on any one object , it is premature to attempt to determine the characteristics or dynamics of the variability patterns .",
    "other causes of the variability can be considered , including flaring , accretion ( for the youngest objects ) or infall in an interacting binary . however , these all rely on transient phenomena , so no one explanation for all objects is that satisfactory .",
    "light curves for 21 late m and l dwarfs were obtained to probe variability on timescales between a fraction of an hour and over 100 hours .",
    "11 objects showed evidence for variability at the 99% confidence level according to a @xmath4 test , with amplitudes between 0.009 and 0.055 magnitudes ( rms ) .",
    "the ten non - detections have upper limits on their rms amplitudes of between 0.009 and 0.043 magnitudes .",
    "power spectral analysis showed that a few objects ( 2m1146 , 2m1334 , sdss  0539 , s  ori  31 ) had significant , dominant periods between 3 and 13 hours . for 2m1334 , sdss  0529 and s  ori  31 these may be the rotation periods .",
    "the remaining seven significantly variable light curves did not show dominant periods , and in at least three cases ( 2m0345 , 2m0913 , calar  3 ) there are not even any significant periods .",
    "simulations showed that any plausible period would have been detected for these objects .",
    "it was concluded that this non - periodic behaviour is probably due to the evolution of surface features ( assumed to produce the variability ) on timescales of a few to a few tens of hours .",
    "these variabilities blur the rotation period , inhibiting its detection .",
    "this is supported by observations of 2m1145 one year apart , in which the two light curves have no common periodicities .",
    "it was speculated that this variability ( at least for the later - type objects ) is due to photospheric dust clouds , the evolution of which could be driven by turbulence and rapid rotation . in support of this is the greater propensity for variability in objects later than m9 , while magnetic activity ( which could otherwise support the presence of magnetically - induced spots ) declines greatly beyond m7 .",
    "the author would like to thank harry lehto for use of his clean code and advice on its use .",
