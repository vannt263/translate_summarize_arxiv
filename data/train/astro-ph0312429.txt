    "since the discovery of the first gravitationally lensed quasar q0957 + 561 @xcite , about 80 strong lens systems have been found so far .",
    "all of the lensed quasars have image separations smaller than @xmath7 , and they are lensed by massive galaxies ( sometimes with small boosts from surrounding groups or clusters of galaxies ) . the probability that distant quasars are lensed by intervening galaxies was originally estimated by @xcite to be 0.1%1% , assuming that galaxies can be modeled as singular isothermal spheres ( sis ) .",
    "this prediction has been verified by several optical and radio lens surveys , such as the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ snapshot survey @xcite , the jodrell bank / very large array astrometric survey ( jvas ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the cosmic lens all sky survey ( class ; * ? ? ?",

    "in contrast , lenses with larger image separations should probe a different deflector population : massive dark matter halos that host groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "such lenses therefore offer valuable and complementary information on structure formation in the universe , including tests of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm @xcite .",
    "so far the observed lack of large separation lensed quasars has been used to infer that , unlike galaxies , cluster - scale halos can not be modeled as singular isothermal spheres @xcite .",
    "the difference can probably be ascribed to baryonic processes : baryonic infall and cooling have significantly modified the total mass distribution in galaxies but not in clusters @xcite . as a result , large separation lenses may constrain the density profiles of dark matter halos of cluster more directly than small separation lenses @xcite . alternatively , large separation lensed quasars may be used to place limits on the abundance of massive halos if the density profiles are specified @xcite .",
    "better yet , the full distribution of lens image separations may provide a systematic diagnostic of baryonic effects from small to large scales in the cdm scenario .",
    "the fact that clusters have less concentrated mass distributions than galaxies implies that large separation lensed quasars should be less abundant than small separation lensed quasars by one or two orders of magnitude .",
    "this explains why past surveys have failed to unambiguously identify large separation lensed quasars @xcite .",
    "for instance , class found 22 small separation lenses but no large separation lenses among @xmath315000 radio sources @xcite .",
    "although several large separation lensed quasar candidates have been found ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they are thought to be physical ( unlensed ) pairs on the basis of individual observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or statistical arguments @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite found 6 candidate lens systems with image separations @xmath9 among @xmath320000 quasars in the two - degree field ( 2df ) quasar sample .",
    "given the lack of high - resolution spectra and deep imaging for the systems , however , it seems premature to conclude that they are true lens systems .",
    "we note that because the expected number of lenses with such large image separations in the 2df sample is much less than unity @xcite , these systems would present a severe challenge to standard models if confirmed as lenses .",
    "to find a first unambiguous large separation lensed quasar , we started a project to search for large separation lenses in the quasar sample of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this project complements ongoing searches for small separation lenses in sdss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the sdss has completed less than half of its planned observations , but already it contains more than 30000 quasars and is superior to previous large separation lens surveys in several ways .",
    "the full sdss sample will comprise @xmath3100000 quasars , so we ultimately expect to find several large separation lensed quasars @xcite .",
    "one of the most important advantages of the sdss in searching for large separation lensed quasars is that imaging in five broad optical bands allows us to select lens candidates quite efficiently .",
    "recently we reported the discovery of the large separation lensed quasar sdss  j1004 + 4112 at @xmath10 @xcite in the sdss .",
    "the quasar itself turned out to be previously identified in the _ rosat _ all sky survey @xcite and the two - micron all - sky survey @xcite , but was not recognized as a lensed system .",
    "@xcite showed that sdss  j1004 + 4112 consists of four quasar images with the same redshift from the keck spectroscopy .",
    "the colors of galaxies found by subaru imaging follow - up observations indicated the presence of a cluster of galaxies at @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , the configuration of the four images was successfully reproduced by a simple lens model based on a singular isothermal ellipsoid mass distribution .",
    "all these results strongly implied that sdss  j1004 + 4112 is the first quasar lens system due to a massive cluster - scale object . in this paper , we describe photometric and spectroscopic follow - up observations of sdss  j1004 + 4112 in detail .",
    "we discuss the spectra of lensed quasar components , including puzzling differences between emission lines seen in the different images .",

    "next we check the colors of nearby unresolved sources to see if any of those sources could be an additional quasar image , restricting the lens search to separations @xmath27 .",
    "we define a large separation lens by @xmath28 so that it exceeds the largest image separation lenses found so far : q0957 + 561 with @xmath29 @xcite and rx  j0921 + 4529 with @xmath30 @xcite , both of which are produced by galaxies in small clusters .",

    "lens surveys of high - redshift quasars are of course very interesting for insights into the abundance and formation of distant quasars ; a search for lenses among high - redshift sdss quasars is the subject of a separate analysis by @xcite .",
    "sdss  j1004 + 4112 was first selected as a lens candidate based on a pair of components , a and b ( see figure  [ fig : sdss1004_i ] ) , where b is the sdss spectroscopic target .",

    "the reason that components c and d have somewhat different colors from b is still unclear , but it must be understood in order to discuss the completeness of the lens survey .",
    "the difference might be ascribed to differential absorption or extinction by intervening material @xcite , or to variability in the source on time scales smaller than the time delays between the images ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "figure  [ fig : spec_line ] shows notable differences in the emission line profiles in the different components .",
    "one possible explanation is the time delay between the lensed images ; at any given observed epoch , the images represent different epochs in the source frame . however , the fact that the emission lines in components a and b differ seems to rule out the time delay explanation : the expected delay ( see  [ sec : modelresult ] ) is shorter than the month or year time scale on which emission lines typically vary ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "other possible explanations include differences between the viewing angles probed by the images , microlensing amplification of part of the quasar emission region , significant errors in the predicted time delay between a and b , or just that the quasar is extremely unusual .",

    "the colors of galaxies in the vicinity of sdss  j1004 + 4112 can help us search for the signature of a cluster .",
    "the central regions of clusters are dominated by early - type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we restrict the plots to galaxies brighter than @xmath88 because of the limitation of the star / galaxy separation .",

    "the galaxies that survive the color cuts are concentrated around g1 , so we conclude that they are candidate members of a cluster of galaxies at @xmath2 whose center is near g1 .",
    "we note that the distribution of candidate cluster members is not spherical and appears to be elongated north  south .",
    "to search for mass models that can explain the image configuration of sdss  j1004 + 4112 , we use standard lens modeling techniques as implemented in the software of @xcite .",
    "the main constraints come from the image positions .",
    "we also use the flux ratios as constraints , although we broaden the errorbars to 20% to account for possible systematic effects due to source variability and time delays , micro- or milli - lensing , or differential extinction ( see table  [ table : posflux ] for the full set of constraint data ) .",
    "in particular , the different colors of the images and the different absorption features seen in figure  [ fig : spec ] suggest that differential extinction may be a significant effect . in this section",
    "we do _ not _ use the position of the main galaxy as a constraint , because we want to understand what constraints can be placed on the center of the lens potential from the lens data alone .",
    "we first consider the simplest possible models for a 4-image lens : an isothermal lens galaxy with a quadrapole produced either by ellipticity in the galaxy or by an external shear .",
    "a spherical isothermal lens galaxy has surface mass density @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the einstein radius of the lens , and @xmath95 is the critical surface mass density for lensing , with @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 being angular diameter distances from the observer to the lens , from the observer to the source , and from the lens to the source , respectively .",
    "the einstein radius is related to the velocity dispersion @xmath99 of the galaxy by @xmath100 for an elliptical model we replace @xmath67 with @xmath101^{1/2}$ ] in the surface density , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the axis ratio and position angle of the ellipse .",
    "simple models using either pure ellipticity or pure shear fail miserably , yielding @xmath104 values no better than @xmath105 for @xmath106 degrees of freedom .",
    "this failure is not surprising : most 4-image lenses require _ both _ ellipticity and external shear ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and such a situation is likely in sdss  j1004 + 4112 since the main galaxy is observed to be elongated and the surrounding cluster surely contributes a shear .",
    "we therefore try models consisting of a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) plus an external shear @xmath107 .",
    "even though such models are still comparatively simple , they can fit the data very well with a best - fit value of @xmath108 for @xmath109 .",
    "the best - fit model has an einstein radius @xmath110  kpc corresponding to a velocity dispersion of 700  km  s@xmath14 , an ellipticity @xmath111 at position angle @xmath112 , and an external shear @xmath113 at position angle @xmath114 . among other known lenses , such",
    "a large shear is found only in lenses lying in cluster environments @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : sieg - crit ] shows the critical curves and caustics for the best - fit model .",
    "the inferred source position lies very close to the caustic and fairly near a cusp , implying that the total magnification is @xmath357 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sieg - params ] shows the allowed ranges for the position of the deflector and the ellipticity and external shear in the model .",
    "the models indicate a small but significant offset of @xmath115  kpc between the center of the lens potential and the main galaxy , although it remains to be seen whether that offset is real or an artifact of these still simple lens models .",
    "even though the simple sie+shear model provides a good fit to the data , we believe that it is not physically plausible because the system clearly has multiple mass components and it seems unlikely that all of the mass is associated with a single @xmath3700  km  s@xmath14 isothermal component . the next level of complication is to add a mass component representing the cluster halo .",
    "we still model the galaxy g1 explicitly , treating it as an isothermal ellipsoid constrained by its observed position . at this point",
    "we do not further complicate the model by attempting to treat the other galaxies within the lens explicitly .",
    "we model the cluster component with an nfw profile which has been predicted in cosmological @xmath116-body simulations @xcite : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is a scale radius , @xmath119 is a characteristic overdensity ( which depends on redshift ) , and @xmath120 is the critical density of the universe .",
    "although the nfw density profile appears to deviate from the results of more recent @xmath116-body simulations in the innermost region @xcite , we adopt this form for simplicity .",
    "the lensing properties of a spherical nfw halo are described by the lens potential @xcite @xmath121,\\ ] ] where the lensing strength is specified by the parameter @xmath122 since asphericity in the cluster potential is important in modeling this system , we generalize the spherical model by adopting elliptical symmetry in the potential . making the potential ( rather than the density ) elliptical",
    "makes it possible to compute the lensing properties of an nfw halo analytically @xcite",
    ". we may still be over - simplifying the mass model , because the cluster profile may have been modified from the nfw form by baryonic processes such as gas cooling @xcite , and the cluster may have a complex angular structure if it is not relaxed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to allow for the latter possibility",
    ", we still include a tidal shear in the lens model that can approximate the effects of complex structure in the outer parts of the cluster .",
    "overall , our goal is not to model all of the complexities of the lens potential , but to make the minimal realistic model and see what we can learn .",
    "even with our simplifying assumptions , we still have a complex parameter space with 11 parameters defining the lens potential : the mass , ellipticity , and position angle for the galaxy g1 ; the position , mass , scale radius , ellipticity , and position angle for the cluster ; and the amplitude and position angle of the shear .",
    "there are also three parameters for the source ( position and flux ) . with just 12 constraints ( position and flux for each of four images ) , the models are under - constrained .",
    "we therefore expect that there may be a range of lens models that can fit the data . to search the parameter space and identify the range of models , we follow the technique introduced by @xcite for many - parameter lens modeling .",
    "specifically , we pick random starting points in the parameter space and then run an optimization routine to find a ( local ) minimum in the @xmath104 surface . repeating that process numerous times",
    "should reveal different minima and thereby sample the full range of models .",
    "many of the recovered models actually lie in local minima that do not represent good fits to the data , so we only keep recovered models with @xmath123 ( which represents the 3@xmath99 limit relative to a perfect fit when examining two - dimensional slices of the allowed parameter range ; see * ? ? ?",
    "we make one further cut on the models . from the previous section , we know that an sie+shear lens model can give a good fit to the data .",
    "thus , there are acceptable two - component models where most or all of the mass is in the galaxy component and the cluster contribution is negligible .",
    "to exclude such models as physically implausible , we impose an upper limit on the velocity dispersion of the model galaxy .",
    "specifically , we only keep models with @xmath124  km  s@xmath14 , because there are essentially no galaxies in the observed universe with larger velocity dispersions , even in rich clusters ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "formally , we impose this cut as an upper limit @xmath125 on the einstein radius of the galaxy g1 .      we first consider models where the scale radius of the cluster is fixed as @xmath126 ( we shall justify this choice below ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : clus - params ] shows the allowed parameter ranges for acceptable models .",
    "first , panel ( a ) shows that the cluster component is restricted to a fairly small ( but not excessively narrow ) range of positions near the center of the image configuration .",
    "this is mainly a result of our upper limit on the mass of the galaxy component ; there is a certain enclosed mass implied by the image separation , and if the galaxy can not contain all of that mass then the cluster component must lie within the image configuration to make up the difference .",
    "it is interesting to note that even in these more complicated models there still seems to be a small offset between the center of the cluster component and the brightest cluster galaxy g1 , although the lower limit implied by our models is just @xmath127kpc .    figure  [ fig : clus - params]b shows that the allowed values for the ellipticity and position angle of the galaxy g1 basically fill the parameter space , so these parameters are not constrained by the lens data .",
    "we might want to impose an external constraint , however .",
    "analyses of other lens systems show that the lensing mass is typically aligned with the projected light distribution @xcite .",
    "we may therefore prefer lens models where the model galaxy is at least roughly aligned with the observed galaxy , which has a position angle of @xmath128 . to illustrate this possible selection , we show all models but highlight those where the position angle of the model galaxy is in the range @xmath129 .",
    "the broad @xmath130 uncertainties prevent this constraint from being too strong .    figure  [ fig : clus - params]c shows that there are some acceptable models where the cluster potential is round , but most models have some ellipticity that is aligned roughly north  south .",
    "this is in good agreement with the distribution of member galaxies which is also aligned roughly north  south ( see figure  [ fig : colorcut ] ) .",
    "the ellipticity @xmath1310.4 is actually quite large , considering that this parameter describes the ellipticity of the potential , not that of the density .",
    "figure  [ fig : clus - params]d shows that all of the acceptable models require a fairly large tidal shear @xmath132 , and models where the galaxy is aligned with the observed galaxy have a strong shear @xmath133 .",
    "the shear tends to be aligned east  west .",
    "the fact that the models want both a large cluster ellipticity and a large tidal shear strongly suggest that there is complex structure in the cluster potential outside of the image configuration",
    ". it would be interesting to see whether there is any evidence for such structure in , for example , x - rays from the cluster .",
    "figure  [ fig : clus - crit ] shows critical curves and caustics for sample lens models .",
    "the critical curves are not well determined .",
    "the outer , tangential critical curve can point either northeast ( panel e ) or northwest ( panel d ) , or it can have a complex shape ( panel a ) .",
    "sometimes there is just one inner , radial critical curve ( panel e ) , but often there are two ( panel c ) .",
    "the distance of the source from the caustic ( and of the images from the critical curve ) varies from model to model , so the total magnification can range from @xmath350 to several hundred or even more . finally , perhaps the most interesting qualitative result is that even the image parities are not uniquely determined . in most models ( e.g. , panels a ",
    "f ) images a and d lie inside the critical curve and have negative parity while b and c lie outside the critical curve and have positive parity .",
    "however , in some models ( e.g. , panels g  h ) the situation is reversed .",
    "having ambiguous image parities is very rare in lens modeling .",
    "so far we have only discussed models where the cluster has a scale radius @xmath134 .",
    "we have also computed models with @xmath135 arcsec and we find that all of the results are quite similar .",
    "to understand what value of the scale radius is reasonable , we must consider which ( if any ) of the models have physically plausible cluster parameters . even though nfw models are formally specified by two parameters @xmath118 and @xmath136 , @xmath116-body simulations reveal that the two parameters are actually correlated .",
    "nfw models therefore appear to form a one - parameter family of models , although with some scatter which reflects the scatter of the concentration parameter @xmath137 ( @xmath138 is a virial radius of the cluster ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : nfwnorm ] shows the predicted relation between @xmath118 and @xmath139 , including the scatter . for comparison",
    ", it also shows the fitted values of @xmath139 in lens models with different scale radii .",
    "models with @xmath140 or @xmath141 require @xmath139 much larger than expected , corresponding to a halo that is too concentrated .",
    "models with @xmath142 , by contrast , overlap with the predictions and thus are physically plausible .",
    "we can therefore conclude very roughly that the cluster component must have @xmath143 and a total virial mass @xmath144 .",
    "finally , we can use the models to predict the time delays between the images .",
    "the models always predict that the time delay between images c and d is the longest and the delay between a and b is the shortest .",
    "however , there is no robust prediction of the temporal ordering : most models predict that the sequence should be c ",
    "b  a  d , but a few models predict the reverse ordering d  a  b ",
    "this is a direct result of the ambiguity in the image parities , because the leading image is always a positive - parity image ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we note , however , that all of the models where the model galaxy is roughly aligned with the observed galaxy have the c  b  a  d ordering .",
    "figure  [ fig : clus - tdel ] shows the predictions for the long and short time delays . the long delay between c and d can be anything up to @xmath145  days , while the short delay between a and b can be up to @xmath146  days . for the models where",
    "the galaxy is roughly aligned with the observed galaxy , the two delays are approximately proportional to each other with @xmath147 .",
    "these results have several important implications .",
    "first , the a  b time delay should be on the order of weeks or months , so it should be very feasible to measure it , provided that the source has detectable variations .",
    "measuring the a ",
    "b delay would be very useful because it would determine the temporal ordering , and thereby robustly determine the image parities .",
    "in addition , it would allow a good estimate of the long c  d delay and indicate whether attempting to measure that delay would be worthwhile .",
    "second , the enormous range of predicted time delays means that constraining the hubble constant with this system @xcite will be difficult because of large systematic uncertainties in the lens models .",
    "although @xcite recently showed that it is possible to obtain useful constraints on the hubble constant even in a complex system with two mass components , the analysis is very complex and requires extensive data including not just the image positions and all of the time delays , but also an einstein ring image and the velocity dispersion of one of the mass components . even if we obtain such data for sdss  j1004 + 4112 in the near future , it seems likely that it will be difficult to obtain reliable constraints on the hubble constant given the complexity of the lens potential in sdss  j1004 + 4112 .",
    "the time delays , however , would still be extremely useful , because they would determine the temporal ordering and hence the image parities , and they would provide constraints that can rule out many of the models that are currently acceptable .",
    "in this section , we calculate the expected rate of large separation lensing in the sdss quasar sample .",
    "the discovery of sdss  j1004 + 4112 allows us to move past the upper limits obtained from previous large separation lens searches , although at present the main thing we can do is test whether the detection of one large separation lens in the current sample is consistent with standard theoretical models in the cdm scenario .",
    "we calculate lensing probabilities using spherical models for simplicity .",
    "although halos in cdm simulations are in fact triaxial ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the spherical assumption is often adopted in lens statistics calculations because deviations from spherical symmetry mainly affect image multiplicities , not image separations or the total optical depth for lensing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while this result has been obtained for isothermal lens potentials , checking it for more general halos is beyond the scope of this paper and is the subject of a follow - up analysis ( m.  oguri et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "let the physical image position in the lens plane and physical source position in the source plane as @xmath148 and @xmath149 , respectively .",
    "consider the probability that a quasar at @xmath150 with luminosity @xmath151 is strongly lensed .",
    "the probability of lensing with image separation larger than @xmath152 is given by @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the cross section for lensing , with @xmath155 being the physical radius of the radial caustic in the source plane .",
    "the lower limit of the mass integral is the mass @xmath156 that corresponds to the image separation @xmath152 ; this can be computed once the density profile of the lens object is specified .",
    "the magnification bias @xmath157 is @xcite @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the luminosity function of source quasars .",
    "note that the magnification factor @xmath160 may be interpreted as the total magnification or the magnification of the brighter or fainter image , depending on the observational selection criteria @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the magnification of the fainter image , because we concentrate on the large separation lenses for which the images are completely deblended .      the lensing probability distribution at large separation reflects the properties of dark halos , rather than galaxies @xcite .",
    "for the statistics calculation , the debate over the inner slope of the density profile seen in @xmath116-body simulations leads us to consider the generalized version @xcite of the nfw density profile ( eq .  [ [ nfw ] ] ) : @xmath161 while the correct value of @xmath50 is still unclear , the existence of cusps with @xmath162 has been established in recent @xmath116-body simulations @xcite .",

    "the scale radius @xmath118 is related to the concentration parameter as @xmath137 .",
    "then the characteristic density @xmath165 is given in terms of the concentration parameter : @xmath166 where @xmath167 is @xmath168 with @xmath169 being the hypergeometric function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we define @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",

    "although we adopt a selection criterion that the flux ratios should be smaller than @xmath180 , this condition does not affect our theoretical predictions because the flux ratios of strong lensing by nfw halos are typically much smaller than @xmath180 @xcite .",
    "the concentration parameter @xmath181 depends on a halo s mass and redshift .",
    "moreover , even halos with the same mass and redshift show significant scatter in the concentration which reflects the difference in formation epoch @xcite , and which is well described by a log - normal distribution . for the median of this distribution ,",
    "we adopt the mass and redshift dependence reported by @xcite as a canonical model : @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the mass collapsing at redshift @xmath184 ( defined by @xmath185 ) . to study uncertainties related to the concentration distribution we also consider other mass and redshift dependences , e.g. , @xmath186 from @xcite , and @xmath187 from @xcite , with @xmath188 being the collapse redshift of the halo of mass @xmath189 .",

    "the presence of a central galaxy is thought to have a small impact on arc statistics @xcite , but the complexity of the lens potentials we found in our mass modeling suggests that the effect of the galaxy on the statistics of lensed quasars also needs to be considered .",
    "we have presented the candidate selection and follow - up observations of the first cluster - scale lensed quasar , sdss  j1004 + 4112 .",
    "the system consists of four components with image separation @xmath260 , and was selected from the large separation lens search in the sdss .",
    "the spectroscopic and photometric follow - up observations confirm sdss  j1004 + 4112 to be a lens system ; spectroscopic observations of four components showed that they have nearly identical spectra with @xmath1 .",

    "differences between the emission line profiles in the four images remain puzzling , and it will be interesting to reobserve the profiles at several epochs to search for variability that might explain the differences .    we have shown that reasonable mass models can successfully reproduce the observed properties of the lens . when we consider models that include both the cluster potential and the brightest cluster galaxy , we find a broad range of acceptable models . despite the diversity in the models , we find several general and interesting conclusions .",
    "first , there appears to be a small ( @xmath261  kpc ) offset between the brightest cluster galaxy and the center of the cluster potential .",
    "such an offset is fairly common in clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "second , the cluster potential is inferred to be elongated roughly north  south , which is consistent with the observed distribution of apparent member galaxies .",
    "third , we found that a significant external shear @xmath262 is needed to fit the data , even when we allow the cluster potential to be elliptical .",
    "this may imply that the structure of the cluster potential outside of the images is more complicated than simple elliptical symmetry .",
    "fourth , given the broad range of acceptable models , we can not determine even the parities and temporal ordering of the images , much less the amplitudes of the time delays between the images .",
    "measurements of any of the time delays would therefore provide powerful new constraints on the models .",
    "we note that the complexity of the lens potential means that the time delays will be more useful for constraining the mass model than for trying to measure the hubble constant .",
    "our modeling results suggest that further progress will require new data ( rather than refinements of current data ) .",
    "the interesting possibilities include catalogs of confirmed cluster members , x - ray observations , and weak lensing maps , not to mention measurement of time delays and confirmation of lensed arcs ( either the possible arclets we have identified , or others ) .",
    "for instance , with an estimated cluster mass of @xmath263 , the estimated x - ray bolometric flux is @xmath264 , which means that the cluster should be accessible with the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ x - ray observatories ; the excellent spatial of _ chandra _ may be particularly useful for separating the diffuse cluster component from the bright quasar images ( which have a total x - ray flux @xmath265 in the _ rosat _ all sky survey )",
    ". the confirmation of lensed arclets would be very valuable , as they would provide many more pixels worth of constraints on the complicated lens potential . in principle , mapping radio jets in the quasar images could unambiguously reveal the image parities ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but unfortunately the quasar appears to be radio quiet as it is not detected in radio sky surveys such as the first survey @xcite .    although the large separation lens search in the sdss is still underway , we can already constrain model parameters from the discovery of sdss  j1004 + 4112 .",
    "the existence of at least one large separation lens in sdss places a lower limit on the lensing probability that complements the upper limits from previous surveys .",
    "both results can be explained if clusters have the density profiles predicted in the collisionless cdm scenario and moderate values of the mass fluctuation parameter @xmath6 .",
    "in particular we find @xmath4 ( 95% confidence ) assuming the inner density profile of dark matter halos has the form @xmath266 with @xmath164 .",
    "the value of @xmath6 is , however , degenerate with @xmath50 such that smaller values of @xmath50 require larger values of @xmath6 .",
    "various systematic errors are estimated to be @xmath267 , dominated by uncertainties in the distribution of the concentration parameter @xmath181 and in the matter density parameter @xmath258 .",
    "other systematic effects , such as triaxiality in the cluster potential and the presence of a central galaxy , remain to be considered .",
    "still , our overall conclusion is that the discovery of sdss  j1004 + 4112 is fully consistent with the standard model of structure formation ( i.e. , cdm with @xmath268 ) .    in summary ,",
    "sdss  j1004 + 4112 is a fascinating new lens system that illustrates how large separation lenses can be used to probe the properties of clusters and test models of structure formation .",

    "<S> we study the recently discovered gravitational lens sdss  j1004 + 4112 , the first quasar lensed by a cluster of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of four images with a maximum separation of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the system was selected from the photometric data of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , and has been confirmed as a lensed quasar at @xmath1 on the basis of deep imaging and spectroscopic follow - up observations . </S>",
    "<S> we present color - magnitude relations for galaxies near the lens plus spectroscopy of three central cluster members , which unambiguously confirm that a cluster at @xmath2 is responsible for the large image separation . </S>",
    "<S> we find a wide range of lens models consistent with the data , and despite considerable diversity they suggest four general conclusions : ( 1 ) the brightest cluster galaxy and the center of the cluster potential well appear to be offset by several kiloparsecs ; ( 2 ) the cluster mass distribution must be elongated in the north  south direction , which is consistent with the observed distribution of cluster galaxies ; ( 3 ) the inference of a large tidal shear ( @xmath30.2 ) suggests significant substructure in the cluster ; and ( 4 ) enormous uncertainty in the predicted time delays between the images means that measuring the delays would greatly improve constraints on the models . </S>",
    "<S> we also compute the probability of such large separation lensing in the sdss quasar sample , on the basis of the cold dark matter model . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of large separation lenses in previous surveys and the discovery of one in sdss together imply a mass fluctuation normalization @xmath4 ( 95% confidence ) , if cluster dark matter halos have an inner density profile @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> shallower profiles would require higher values of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> although the statistical conclusion might be somewhat dependent on the degree of the complexity of the lens potential , the discovery of sdss  j1004 + 4112 is consistent with the predictions of the abundance of cluster - scale halos in the cold dark matter scenario . </S>"
