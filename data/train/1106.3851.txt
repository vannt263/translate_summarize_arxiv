    "it consists of a non - linear parabolic free boundary evolution equation which describes the evolution of the densities of buyers and vendors and also determines the price of the good .",
    "here we consider the problem on the real interval @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes the maximum and @xmath2 the minimum price .",
    "the model is given by the free boundary value problem    [ eq : pfm ] @xmath3    with @xmath4 and compatibility conditions at time @xmath5 : @xmath6 . throughout this paper",
    "we assume that @xmath7 is in @xmath8 and denote the @xmath9 norm on @xmath0 by @xmath10 .",
    "system has been studied in a number of papers , see @xcite . here",
    "we present global ( non-)existence results of a solution of on the bounded interval @xmath0 .",
    "in the sequel we denote the positive and negative part of a function @xmath11 defined for @xmath12 by @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "we extend @xmath15,@xmath16 by the value @xmath17 outside the interval @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath11 be a solution of the modified price formation problem consisting of equation with conditions , initial datum and modified boundary conditions ( bc ) : @xmath18 then the function @xmath19 is a solution of the following bvp for the heat equation    [ eq : heat ] @xmath20    where @xmath21 is constructed from @xmath7 according to .",
    "conversely , if @xmath22 is a solution of then @xmath23 satisfies , , , .",
    "the construction of the function @xmath22 is motivated by the fact that @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) has jump - discontinuities at @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) and @xmath26 of equal magnitude but opposite signs .",
    "the summation procedure then moves the jumps in the derivatives of @xmath11 outwards .",
    "note that the sum in actually consists only of finitely many terms and that the free boundary @xmath27 of the price formation problem becomes the zero level set of the heat solution and vice versa . in principle",
