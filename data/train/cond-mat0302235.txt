    "the time @xmath0 during which the quantum coherence of an electron is maintained is of fundamental importance in mesoscopic physics .",
    "the observability of many phenomena specific to this field relies on a long enough phase coherence time.@xcite amongst these are the weak localization correction to the conductance ( wl ) , the universal conductance fluctuations ( ucf ) , the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect , persistent currents in rings , the proximity effect near the interface between a superconductor and a normal metal , and others .",
    "hence it is crucial to find out what mechanisms limit the quantum coherence of electrons .    in metallic thin films , at low temperature , electrons experience mostly elastic collisions from sample boundaries , defects of the ion lattice and static impurities in the metal .",
    "these collisions do not destroy the quantum coherence of electrons .",
    "instead they can be pictured as resulting from a static potential on which the diffusive - like electronic quantum states are built .",
    "what limits the quantum coherence of electrons are inelastic collisions .",
    "these are collisions with other electrons through the screened coulomb interaction , with phonons , and also with extrinsic sources such as magnetic impurities or two level systems in the metal .",
    "whereas above about 1  k electron - phonon interactions are known to be the dominant source of decoherence,@xcite electron - electron interactions are expected to be the leading inelastic process at lower temperatures in samples without extrinsic sources of decoherence.@xcite    the theory of electron - electron interactions in the diffusive regime was worked out in the early 1980 s ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "it predicts a power law divergence of @xmath0 when the temperature @xmath2 goes to zero .",
    "effects of quantum interference are therefore expected to grow significantly upon cooling down the electrons . in mesoscopic wires ,",
    "the predicted power law @xmath4 was first observed in 1986 by wind _ _ et al.__@xcite between 2  k and 5  k in aluminum and silver wires and then by echternach _ _ et al.__@xcite down to 100  mk in a gold wire .",
    "however , in 1997 , mohanty , jariwala , and webb@xcite published a series of measurements of @xmath0 on gold wires with a broad range of diffusion coefficients .",
    "they observed that the phase coherence time tends to saturate at low temperature , typically below 0.5 k , in apparent contradiction with theoretical predictions .",
    "that same year , measurements of the energy exchange rate between electrons in copper wires@xcite were found to be at odds , both qualitatively and quantitatively , with the prediction for electron - electron interactions .",
    "both experiments suggested that electrons in mesoscopic metallic wires interact with each other differently and more strongly than predicted by theory .    to shed some light on this issue we present here several sets of experiments probing the phase coherence time at low temperature in mesoscopic metal wires.@xcite we summarize our most important conclusions here .",
    "first , we measured @xmath5 down to 40  mk in several wires made of copper , silver , and gold and fabricated from source materials of various purities .",
    "we found in the four very pure silver wires and in the very pure gold wire that @xmath5 does not saturate in the investigated temperature range , but continues to increase as the temperature is lowered in agreement with the theoretical prediction . since these samples have comparable resistances and geometries as some measured in @xcite , this observation casts doubt on the assertion @xcite that saturation of @xmath0 is a universal feature of weakly - disordered metals .",
    "second , we tested the impact of very dilute magnetic impurities with a small kondo temperature on the temperature dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "we found that even at concentrations lower than one part per million ( 1  ppm ) , such impurities can cause @xmath5 to display a plateau over a large temperature range .",
    "this could explain why saturation of @xmath0 at low temperature is frequently observed . finally , we probed the magnetic field dependence of the phase coherence time by measuring the magnetoresistance of copper aharonov - bohm rings showing a temperature - independent @xmath0 at low temperature .",
    "the amplitude of the aharonov - bohm conductance oscillations increased strongly on a field scale proportional to the temperature , indicating that the phase coherence time at zero field was limited by spin - flip scattering from magnetic impurities .",
    "figure  [ figsamplewl ] displays the photograph of a typical sample together with a schematic of the measurement setup .",
    "all samples were fabricated using standard e - beam lithography techniques .",
    "a bilayer resist , consisting of a copolymer p(mma / maa ) bottom layer and a pmma top layer , was first spun onto an oxidized si substrate wafer .",
    "this bilayer was then patterned by e - beam lithography to tailor a mask . the metal  gold , copper or silver",
    " was deposited directly through this mask in evaporators used only for non - magnetic metals.@xcite    samples made at saclay used a si substrate thermally oxidized over 500  nm , and metal evaporation was performed in an electron gun evaporator .",
    "the silver source material was placed inside a carbon liner , whereas copper and gold were put directly in the buckets of the e - gun system .",
    "metal evaporation took place at a base pressure of about @xmath6  mbar with an evaporation rate of 0.2 , 0.5 and 1  nm / s for silver , gold and copper respectively ( see@xcite ) .",
    "samples made at michigan state university ( msu ) were evaporated on a si substrate with only the native oxide in a thermal evaporator used only for silver , aluminum , gold , copper and titanium .",
    "the source material and boat were replaced before each evaporation and manipulated using plastic tweezers .",
    "the pressure during evaporation was about @xmath6  mbar and the evaporation rate ranged between 0.2 and 0.5  nm / s.@xcite    we measured the low field magnetoresistance of copper , gold and silver wires fabricated using source materials of purity 99.999% ( 5n ) and 99.9999% ( 6n ) .",

    "such a possibility had not been considered until recently because , all spin states being degenerate at zero magnetic field , magnetic impurities do not contribute to energy exchange in first order .",
