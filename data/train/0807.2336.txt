    "interest in neutrinoless double - beta decay has seen a significant renewal in recent years after evidence for neutrino oscillations was obtained from the results of atmospheric , solar , reactor and accelerator neutrino experiments ( see , for example , the discussions in @xcite ) .",
    "these results are impressive proof that neutrinos have a non - zero mass .",
    "however , the experiments studying neutrino oscillations are not sensitive to the nature of the neutrino mass ( dirac or majorana ) and provide no information on the absolute scale of the neutrino masses , since such experiments are sensitive only to the difference of the masses , @xmath18 .",
    "the detection and study of @xmath7 decay may clarify the following problems of neutrino physics ( see discussions in @xcite ) : ( i ) lepton number non - conservation , ( ii ) neutrino nature : whether the neutrino is a dirac or a majorana particle , ( iii ) absolute neutrino mass scale ( a measurement or a limit on @xmath19 ) , ( iv ) the type of neutrino mass hierarchy ( normal , inverted , or quasidegenerate ) , ( v ) cp violation in the lepton sector ( measurement of the majorana cp - violating phases ) .",
    "the currently running nemo  3 experiment is devoted to the search for @xmath7 decay and to the accurate measurement of two neutrino double beta decay ( @xmath20 decay ) by means of the direct detection of the two electrons .",
    "this tracking experiment , in contrast to experiments with @xmath21ge , detects not only the total energy deposition , but other parameters of the process .",
    "these include the energy of the individual electrons , angle between them , and the coordinates of the event in the source plane .",
    "since june of 2002 , the nemo  3 detector has operated in the frjus underground laboratory ( france ) located at a depth of 4800 m w.e . since february 2003 , after the final tuning of the experimental set - up",
    ", nemo  3 has been taking data devoted to double beta decay studies .",
    "the first obtained results with @xmath0mo and @xmath1se were published in @xcite .",
    "the nemo  3 detector has three main components , a foil consisting of different sources of double beta decay isotopes and copper , a tracker made of geiger wire cells and a calorimeter made of scintillator blocks with pmt readout , surrounded by a solenoidal coil .",
    "the detector has the ability to discriminate between events of different types by positive identification of charged tracks and photons . a schematic view of the nemo  3 detector is shown in fig .  [ fig : nemo3-detector ] .",
    "the nemo  3 detector is cylindrical in design and is composed of twenty equal sectors .",
    "the external dimensions of the detector with shields are about 6 m in diameter and 4 m in height .",
    "nemo  3 is based on the techniques tested on previous incarnations of the experiment nemo  1 @xcite , and nemo  2 @xcite .",
    "the wire chamber is made of 6180 open octagonal drift cells which operate in geiger mode ( geiger cells ) . a gas mixture of @xmath11 95% helium , 4% ethyl - alcohol , 1% argon and 0.15% water at 10 mbar above atmospheric pressure is used as the filling gas of the wire chamber .",
    "each drift cell provides a three - dimensional measurement of the charged particle tracks by recording the drift time and the two plasma propagation times .",
    "the transverse position is determined from the drift time , while the longitudinal position is deduced from the difference between the plasma propagation times at both ends of the cathode wires .",
    "the average vertex position resolution for the two - electron events is @xmath22 cm in the transverse plane of the detector and @xmath23 cm in the longitudinal plane .",
    "the geiger counters information is treated by the track reconstruction program based on the cellular automaton algorithm , described in @xcite .",
    "the calorimeter , which surrounds the wire chamber , is composed of 1940 plastic scintillator blocks coupled by light - guides to very low - radioactivity photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) developed by hammamatsu .",
    "the energy resolution fwhm of the calorimeter ranges from 14.1 to 17.6% for 1 mev electrons , while the time resolution is of 250 ps at 1 mev",
