    "modern astronomical observatories are currently being planned and developed in many sites , as national observatory or as joint international consortium involving some countries , across all continents .",
    "large and sophisticated facilities , especially for a dedicated instrument and/or wavelength , must consider various excellent observing conditions .",
    "one of important factors that determine the success of developing and operating such astronomical facilities is the climate condition of the chosen site .",
    "the identification of potential sites are usually made after a careful long study . in asia",
    ", we can see examples from maidanak observatory in uzbekistan ( ehgamberdiev et al .",
    "2000 ) and devasthal in india ( sagar et al . 2000 ) .",
    "analysis of this climate factor could comprise several important characterisations , such as cloud cover , atmospheric thermal background , sky brightness , precipitable water vapour , atmospheric seeing and optical extinction , and so on . in north africa ,",
    "optical seeing at the oukameden has been long monitored ( siher & benkhaldoun 2004 , benkhaldoun et al .",
    "2005 ) . not far from it in spain , the largest european astronomical sites in the northern hemisphere , in la palma , characterisations have been continuously monitored ( lombardi et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 , 2008 ) , and also in calar alto ( snchez et al . 2007 ) .",
    "in addition , varela et al .",
    "( 2008 ) analysed atmospheric aerosol intensively above canary island based on both satellite data and in situ measurements .",
    "site characterisation in san pedro mrtir , mexico , has also been made after more than three decades of its operation ( tapia et al .",
    "it also includes measurement of millimetric and infrared opacities . in california ,",
    "barcroft facility of the white mountain research station is identified as an excellent site for microwave observation ( marvil et al .",
    "2006 ) . therefore",
    ", careful site selection has been extremely important to consider from the very beginning of the project . meanwhile",
    ", many major observatories continue to evaluate their sites to better understand the climate and character of the sites for observation scheduling and development planning .",
    "site testing and selection for the thirty meter telescope ( tmt ) is another relevant example of modern astronomical site selection ( schck et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) .",
    "presently , most major ground - based observatories are built either on coastal mountains , such as in chile and in mid - west america , or on mountains in relatively small island , such as in canary island and in hawaii .",
    "the altitude of the mountains is higher than 2000 m. most of them are located in subtropical zone , in latitude between 25@xmath1 and 35@xmath1 north or south .",
    "efforts to search the best possible site on earth has also led astronomers to survey the polar regions since they certainly could provide cold , dry , and dark winter skies with mild wind , excellent seeing , and high clear sky fraction ( see , for example , andersen & rasmussen 2006 ; saunders et al .",
    "2009 ; steinbring et al .",
    "2010 ) .    in this work ,",
    "we present the search for a new astronomical site in indonesia which is located around the equator .",
    "this country covers 95@xmath1141@xmath1e and 6@xmath1n to 11@xmath1s .",
    "hence , this represents a vast geographical area and entirely in tropical region .",
    "note also that indonesia is an archipelago dominated by seas , dotted with a few big islands and a lot of small islands .",
    "this study is motivated by a plan to build a new astronomical observatory , as an extension of the bosscha observatory , located in lembang ( 107@xmath136@xmath2e , 6@xmath149@xmath2s ) , the only major observatory in indonesia .",
    "note that there were already plans in 1980s to propose a 2-m class telescope ( van der hucht 1984 ) and a consortium to build a giant equatorial radio telescope ( swarup , hidayat & sukumar 1984 ) in indonesia .",
    "however , they have yet to be realised .",
    "after more than eight decades , a new modern astronomical facility is thought necessary and is required to continue and advance astronomical research and education in indonesia .",
    "the desired facility is a new modern one , in the framework of national observatory , operated within a concept of multi - wavelength observatory ; primarily in the optical , infrared , and radio .",
    "this may represent a long - term program that must be continuously reviewed and pursued .",
    "therefore , to realise such a facility , a series of preparatory work must be conducted .    as outlined above , to determine the best possible locations for astronomical sites , there are many atmospheric and geographical parameters which must be studied carefully ; and eventually site testing and monitoring must be performed for a long period of time , i.e. , more than 3 to 5 years .",
    "hence , first of all , we must identify certain regions that could provide a better meteorological condition .",
    "for this aim , we decide to evaluate the clear sky fraction , as the first important parameter , above indonesia using meteorological satellite data from a period of more than a decade , to obtain the pattern and quantity of cloud coverage .",
    "we adopt methodology described in erasmus & sarazin ( 2002 ) .",
    "similar study has been made for many astronomical observatories ( see , for example , erasmus & van rooyen 2006 , sebag et al .",
    "2007 , della valle et al .",
    "2010 , cavazzani et al .",
    "motivation of this study and the use of satellite data are outlined in the following .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the satellite data bases used in this study is depicted in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we describe the methodology adopted in this work .",
    "furthermore , the data analysis is presented in section 4 , and is followed by the site selection analysis in section 5 .",
    "discussion of the results is given in section 6 , and finally conclusion is drawn in section 7 .",

    "= opaque ; the number in the bracket corresponds to the site number ( see table 3 ) .      to obtain the night time clear fraction profile , in the following we analyse mountain sites in terms of yearly average usable night , i.e. , a total of clear ( photometric ) sky and transitional ( spectroscopic ) sky from 1996 to 2010 .",
    "7 shows the results for the sites in sumatra ( a ) .",
    "it appears that from the four selected sites in sumatra , kerinci ( site 18 ) , altitude 2900 m , is better than the other sites in north sumatra .",
    "however , the largest clear fraction in this mountain is low , i.e. , @xmath335 per cent , occured in 1997 and 2006 .",
    "the other years have lower values with transitional night time contribution of 6.5 per cent .",
    "moreover , the three sites around lake toba , at altitudes 21002400 m , present much lower value , fluctuating between 10 to 25 per cent . note that these sites are also close to the equator .",
    "subsequently , fig .  8 displays comparison of the fraction of clear sky for the sites in java and west nusa tenggara ( region b ) .",
    "first we note that the annual clear night sky in lembang is about 40 per cent only that corresponds to @xmath3150 nights of observations ( about five months of effective time ) .",
    "compared to west ijen ( site 19 ) , we obtain a factor of 15 per cent better than the reference site of lembang .",
    "high values are found in 1997 , 2002 , and 2006 , i.e. , between 6066 per cent .",
    "spectroscopic nights contribute about 6 per cent for both sites .",
    "furthermore , the sites in lombok and sumbawa ( sites 11 , 25 , 26 ) present much better clear nights . since the sites 25 and 26 are close to each other ( despite their different altitudes )",
    ", we expect that their clear sky fractions are not too different . the largest values ( @xmath370 per cent )",
    "are found in 1997 , 2002 , and 2007 .",
    "east sumbawa ( site 11 ) , located closer to east nusa tenggara rather than rinjani , appears also as a good site but at lower altitudes .    for region c ( east nusa tenggara )",
    ", we have selected two reference sites ( sites 3 and 4 ) which are found systematically better than the other mountain sites . among the eight mountain sites analysed",
    ", there are four promising locations , that is , timau ( site 29 ) , alor ( site 31 ) , mutis ( site 30 ) , and ruteng ( site 27 ) with yearly average clear nights above 60 per cent .",
    "spectroscopic nights contribute below 5 per cent , except for ruteng in flores island .",
    "the comparison is displayed in fig .",
    "moreover , for region d ( sulawesi ) and e ( papua ) , the fraction of clear nights are shown in fig .",
    "10 and 11 , respectively .",
    "they have much lower clear nights compared to c , so they are better compared to the site of lembang .",
    "the mountain sites of sulawesi seems providing more fluctuating yearly clear nights .",
    "we found only binohoe ( site 23 ) and sangihe - siau ( site 24 ) which are systematically better than lembang .",
    "note that lombosang ( site 21 ) presents a comparable situation to lembang during the last five years .",
    "in contrast , the region e ( papua ) provides a very low fraction of clear nights ( less than 15 per cent ) .",
    "the highest site , puncak jaya 1 ( site 33 ) , has clear fraction even mostly below 10 per cent .",
    "therefore , like in north sumatra , mountains in papua appear not suitable for astronomical sites .",
    "table 4 shows the mean of 15 years of usable nights for the 24 mountain sites including three reference sites .",
    "the sites are sorted according to decreasing usable nights along with its standard deviation ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we see that our reference sites 3 and 4 are indeed better with @xmath5 per cent .",
    "we also can verify the contribution of spectroscopic nights in addition to photometric nights .",
    "note that south waingapu ( site 12 ) , despite its large clear fraction , has a higher @xmath4 .",
    "the same case holds for east sumbawa ( site 11 ) with @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , compared to timau ( site 29 ) , alor ( site 31 ) , mutis ( site 29 ) , and rinjani ( sites 25 and 26 ) , the sites 11 and 12 are relatively good but ` less stable ' .",
    "ruteng ( site 27 ) also falls in this category .",
    "we also notice that the contribution of spectroscopic nights are slightly lower in timau and mutis compared to alor and rinjani as such that the former are possibly better than the latter .",
    "considering , however , uncertainties on the data ( @xmath310 per cent ) , we actually estimate that they are likely to be similar .",
    "this suggest that we are led to a down - selection to timor , alor , and lombok , three islands in nusa tenggara .",
    "from the above analysis , we found dry periods , detected in most regions , i.e. , in 1997 , 2002 , and 2006 .",
    "so the periodicity of 45 years is still to be confirmed in the long period , or decades .",
    "some regions have persistently show a large clear sky fraction , mainly in east nusa tenggara , with its many small islands .",
    "moreover , coastal area presents better situation of clear sky .",
    "mountain sites in the proximity of coastal area generally also present large fraction of the clear sky , such as in timau and alor , and also in the north - eastern side of rinjani .",
    "the yearly clear sky pattern can be inspected quickly using a daily chart as can be seen in fig .",
    "12 and 13 . in fig .",
    "12 , we display three charts of reference sites ( kupang , sawu , and lembang ) as compared to timau , a potential site inferred in this study .",
    "the chart of lembang is for 2006 , that is , the driest period of the 15 years , while the three others are for 2002 , corresponding to the same driest situation .",
    "notice also missing data ( appearing like regular black boxes ) that we consider in our calculation as opaque .",
    "we see that cloudy situations are found mostly in january and february in the three sites of nusa tenggara , compared to longer cloudy situation in lembang , from january to april , and starting over again in december of the corresponding year",
    ".    then , we also select the driest period for four other less clear sites as shown in fig",
    ".  13 , i.e. , the sites of silimapuluh ( in a ) , rinjani 1 ( in b ) , binohoe ( in d ) , and puncak jaya 2 ( in e ) .",
    "we have a clear sky in silimapuluh only between january and february and then almost opaque all the time .",
    "the case of rinjani is similar to the sites presented in fig .  12 , but it is slightly less clear than that in east nusa tenggara . for binohoe",
    ", the situation has a smaller fraction of clear sky .",
    "lastly , for puncak jaya , it appears that the cloud in this region presents almost every time and the night time appears more cloudy than the day time , probably due to biases introduced by the fixed thresholds .      as inferred in section 5.4 , timau in timor island",
    "is relatively the best site in terms of the fraction of usable night .",
    "however , the altitude of this site is lower than 2000 m. mutis , about 45 km to the south - east of timau , is also good site with a high altitude of 2400 m. timau is relatively better than alor ( about the same altitude ) because timau has more photometric nights .",
    "we have visited both mutis ( in september 2007 ) and timau ( in august 2008 and 2009 ) , but not up to the summits . at the time of our visit to mutis",
    ", we found it was wet , and there were fog at altitudes lower than 1600 m. on the other hand , the area around timau is indeed very dry .",
    "the site of rinjani in lombok island is also relatively good , and we prefer the point to the north - east of the mountain summit .",
    "the photometric night fraction is 55 per cent while the spectroscopic fraction is slightly greater than 5 per cent .",
    "ruteng in flores island can not be ruled out from this analysis since it is marginally comparable to rinjani .",
    "we recommend therefore four island in nusa tenggara for further site testing , with the sites in timor island as high priority .",
    "the present work is limited to identifying the potential sites for our future national observatory .",
    "more detailed analyses for these sites in a monthly average fraction will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "meteorological satellite data with a time span of 15 years , from four different satellites , have been used to retrieve the fraction of clear sky above indonesia for astronomical site selection .",
    "this allows us to obtain a detailed cloud cover pattern over indonesia since the data have high spatial resolution ( @xmath35 km ) and provide a time span longer than a decade . accordingly",
    ", the fraction of clear sky can be analysed separately for day time and night time , and either for monthly or yearly average .",
    "the fraction of photometric and spectroscopic nights are inferred to obtain the usable nights , and also the fraction of opaque nights .",
    "fifteen years data period has indicated that clear sky fraction over some regions in east nusa tenggara can unambiguously reach better than 70 per cent with an uncertainty of 10 per cent .",
    "a stable clear night fraction is found during april to october with a value between 55 to 75 per cent .    in tropical region like indonesia , we find that the higher the altitudes of the regions ( mountains ) , the more frequent the presence of clouds is .",
    "coastal regions in east nusa tenggara are systematically drier than that in the high mountains .",
    "five sites are recommended for site testing and to be analysed further : timau , mutis , alor , rinjani , and ruteng .",
    "regions near timau in timor has been visited , but a longer and complete survey must also be conducted . site survey is absolutely necessary to obtain real situation in the field and we must undertake in situ measurement continuously .",
    "this also must consider the detailed geographic situation of the regions .",
    "a number of theoretical and measurement programmes will be undertaken in the near future .",
    "the authors wish to thanks the weather team in kochi university , japan , for providing the data archive open for research and education .",
