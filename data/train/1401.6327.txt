    "the soliton - producing nonlinear wave equation is a topic of significant scientific interest .",
    "one commonly used example is the so - called  good \" boussinesq ( gb ) equation @xmath4 it is similar to the well - known korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation ; a balance between dispersion and nonlinearity leads to the existence of solitons .",
    "the gb equation and its various extensions have been investigated by many authors .",
    "for instance , a closed form solution for the two soliton interaction of eq .",
    "( [ bsq ] ) was obtained by manoranjan _",
    "_ in @xcite and a few numerical experiments were performed based on the petrov - galerkin method with linear  hat \" functions . in @xcite , it was shown that the gb equation possesses a highly complicated mechanism for the solitary waves interaction .",
    "ortega and sanz - serna @xcite discussed nonlinear stability and convergence of some simple finite difference schemes for the numerical solution of this equation .",
    "more analytical and numerical works related to gb equations can be found in the literature , for example @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the gb equation ( [ bsq ] ) , with a periodic boundary condition over an 1-d domain @xmath5 and initial data @xmath6 , @xmath7 , both of which are @xmath8-periodic .",
    "it is assumed that a unique , periodic , smooth enough solution exists for ( [ bsq ] ) over the time interval @xmath9 .",
    "this @xmath8-periodicity assumption is reasonable if the solution to ( [ bsq ] ) decays exponentially outside @xmath10 $ ] .    due to the periodic boundary condition",
    ", the fourier collocation ( pseudospectral ) differentiation is a natural choice to obtain the optimal spatial accuracy .",
    "there has been a wide and varied literature on the development of spectral and pseudospectral schemes .",
    "for instance , the stability analysis for linear time - dependent problems can be found in @xcite , etc , based on eigenvalue estimates .",
    "some pioneering works for nonlinear equations were initiated by maday and quarteroni @xcite for steady - state spectral solutions . also note the analysis of one - dimensional conservation laws by tadmor and collaborators @xcite , semi - discrete viscous burgers equation and navier - stokes equations by e @xcite , the galerkin spectral method for navier - stokes equations led by guo @xcite and shen @xcite , and the fully discrete ( discrete both in space and time ) pseudospectral method applied to viscous burgers equation in @xcite by gottlieb and wang and @xcite by bressan and quarteroni , etc .",
    "most of the theoretical developments in nonlinear spectral and pseudospectral schemes are related to a parabolic pde , in which the diffusion term plays a key role in the stability and convergence analysis .",
    "very few works have analyzed a fully discrete pseudospectral method applied to a nonlinear hyperbolic pde . among the existing ones ,",
    "it is worth mentioning frutos _",
    "s work @xcite on the nonlinear analysis of a second order ( in time ) pseudospectral scheme for the gb equation ( with @xmath11 ) .",
    "however , as the authors point out in their remark on page 119 , these theoretical results were not optimal : _ `` ... our energy norm is an @xmath12-norm of @xmath13 combined with a negative norm of @xmath14 .",
    "this should be compared with the energy norm in @xcite : there , no integration with respect to @xmath15 is necessary and convergence is proved in @xmath16 for @xmath13 and @xmath12 for @xmath14''_. the difficulties in the analysis are due to the absence of a dissipation mechanism in the gb equation ( [ bsq ] ) , which makes the nonlinear error terms much more challenging to analyze than that of a parabolic equation .",
    "the presence of a second order spatial derivative for the nonlinear term leads to an essential difficulty of numerical error estimate in a higher order sobolev norm .",
    "in addition to the lack of optimal numerical error estimate , @xcite also imposes a severe time step restriction : @xmath17 ( with @xmath18 a fixed constant ) , in the nonlinear stability analysis .",
    "such a constraint becomes very restrictive for a fine numerical mesh and leads to a high computational cost .    in this work",
    "we propose a second order ( in time ) pseudospectral scheme for the the gb equation ( [ bsq ] ) with an alternate approach , and provide a novel nonlinear analysis . in more detail , an @xmath0 convergence for @xmath13 and @xmath1 convergence for @xmath14 are derived , compared with the @xmath1 convergence for @xmath13 and @xmath2 convergence for @xmath14 , as reported in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , such a convergence is unconditional ( for the time step @xmath19 in terms of space grid size @xmath20 ) so that the severe time step constraint @xmath17 is avoided .",
    "the methodology of the proposed second order temporal discretization is very different from that in @xcite . to overcome the difficulty associated with the second order temporal derivative in the hyperbolic equation",
    ", we introduce a new variable @xmath21 to approximate @xmath14 , which greatly facilitates the numerical implementation . on the other hand ,",
    "the corresponding second order consistency analysis becomes non - trivial because of an @xmath22 numerical error between the centered difference of @xmath13 and the mid - point average of @xmath21 . without a careful treatment ,",
    "such an @xmath23 numerical error might seem to introduce a reduction of temporal accuracy , because of the second order time derivative involved in the equation . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we perform a higher order consistency analysis by an asymptotic expansion ; as a result , the constructed approximate solution satisfies the numerical scheme with a higher order truncation error .",
    "furthermore , a projection of the exact solution onto the fourier space leads to an optimal regularity requirement .    for the nonlinear stability and convergence analysis",
    ", we have to obtain a direct estimate of the ( discrete ) @xmath16 norm of the nonlinear numerical error function .",
    "this estimate relies on the aliasing error control lemma for pseudospectral approximation to nonlinear terms , which was proven in a recent work @xcite . that s the key reason why we are able to overcome the key difficulty in the nonlinear estimate and obtain an @xmath0 convergence for @xmath13 and @xmath1 convergence for @xmath14 .",
    "we prove that the proposed numerical scheme is fully consistent ( with a higher order expansion ) , stable and convergent in the @xmath16 norm up to some fixed final time @xmath24 . in turn , the maximum norm bound of the numerical solution is automatically obtained , because of the @xmath16 error estimate and the corresponding sobolev embedding .",
    "therefore , the inverse inequality in the stability analysis is not needed and any scaling law between @xmath19 and @xmath20 is avoided , compared with the @xmath17 constraint reported in @xcite .",
    "this paper is outlined as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the fourier spectral and pseudospectral differentiation , recall an aliasing error control lemma ( proven in @xcite ) , and present an alternate second order ( in time ) pseudospectral scheme for the gb equation ( [ bsq ] ) . in section 3 , the consistency analysis of the scheme is studied in detail . the stability and convergence analysis is reported in section 4 .",
    "a simple numerical result is presented in section 5 .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are made in section 6 .",

    "the fourier interpolation of the function is defined by @xmath36 where the @xmath32 pseudospectral coefficients @xmath37 are computed based on the interpolation condition @xmath38 on the @xmath39 equidistant points @xcite .",
    "these collocation coefficients can be efficiently computed using the fast fourier transform ( fft ) .",
    "note that the pseudospectral coefficients are not equal to the actual fourier coefficients ; the difference between them is known as the aliasing error . in general , @xmath40 , and even @xmath41 , except of course in the case that @xmath42 .",
    "the fourier series and the formulas for its projection and interpolation allow one to easily take derivative by simply multiplying the appropriate fourier coefficients @xmath43 by @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , we can take subsequent derivatives in the same way , so that differentiation in physical space is accomplished via multiplication in fourier space .",
    "as long as @xmath45 and all is derivatives ( up to @xmath46-th order ) are continuous and periodic on @xmath47 , the convergence of the derivatives of the projection and interpolation is given by @xmath48 in which @xmath49 denotes the @xmath12 norm . for more details , see the discussion of approximation theory by canuto and quarteroni @xcite .    for any collocation approximation to the function @xmath50 at the points @xmath35 @xmath51",

    "alternatively , we can view the differentiation operator @xmath52 as a matrix , and the above process can be seen as a matrix - vector multiplication .",
    "the same process is performed for the second and fourth derivatives @xmath56 , @xmath57 , where this time the collocation coefficients are multiplied by @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively . in turn , the differentiation matrix can be applied for multiple times , i.e. the vector @xmath33 is multiplied by @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .    since the pseudospectral differentiation is taken at a point - wise level , a discrete @xmath12 norm and inner product need to be introduced to facilitate the analysis .",
    "given any periodic grid functions @xmath33 and @xmath62 ( over the numerical grid ) , we note that these are simply vectors and define the discrete @xmath12 inner product and norm @xmath63 the following summation by parts ( see @xcite ) will be of use : @xmath64      this lemma , established in @xcite , allows us to bound the aliasing error for the nonlinear term , and will be critical to our analysis . for any function @xmath65 in the space @xmath66 , its collocation coefficients @xmath67",

    "furthermore , a detailed calculation shows that all the eigenvalues of the linear operator on the left hand side are positive , and so the unique unconditional solvability of the proposed scheme ( [ numerical ] ) is assured . in practice , the fft can be utilized to efficiently obtain the numerical solutions .",
    "an introduction of the variable @xmath21 not only facilitates the numerical implementation , but also improves the numerical stability , due to the fact that only two consecutive time steps @xmath82 , @xmath83 , are involved in the second order approximation to @xmath84 .",

    "a finite fourier projection of the exact solution is taken to the gb equation ( [ bsq ] ) and a local truncation error is derived .",
