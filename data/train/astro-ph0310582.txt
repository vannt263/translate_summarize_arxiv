    "presently we know of about 90 @xmath0 cephei and 100 spb stars in the galaxy .",
    "their pulsational instability is caused by the @xmath3 mechanism working at temperature of about 2 @xmath4 10@xmath5 k ( see , e.g. , dziembowski & pamyatnykh 1993 ) .",
    "since the opacity bump driving pulsations in these stars originates as a result of a large number of bound - bound transitions in the iron - group ions , the metallicity dependence of the instability strips is an obvious consequence .",
    "pamyatnykh ( 1999 ) showed this in detail , finding that the @xmath0  cephei instability strip practically vanishes at @xmath6 0.01 .",
    "a similar shrinking of the instability strip is predicted for spb stars , although the dependence is not so strong and even at @xmath7 = 0.01 the instability strip is still quite large .",
    "observationally , this dependence was confirmed by pigulski et al .",
    "( 2002 ) who found a striking difference between the incidence of @xmath0  cephei stars in northern and southern open clusters .",
    "this fact could be explained as a result of the metallicity gradient in the galaxy .",
    "it is therefore very important to know whether , and how many @xmath0  cephei and spb stars could be found in objects of even lower metallicities . with their low metallicities ,",
    "the large ( lmc , @xmath8 0.008 ) and small ( smc , @xmath9 0.004 ) magellanic clouds are among the best objects for such a study .",
    "the magellanic clouds were the targets of many observational surveys , including the microlensing ones , ogle and macho , that provided photometric data for millions of stars .",
    "recently , the ogle - ii observations of magellanic clouds have been reprocessed and the photometry of all stars in the reference frames has been obtained by means of the modified dia software of woniak ( 2000 ) .",
    "we used this photometry to search for periodic variations of stars located in the upper main - sequence of the lmc . for over 75000 stars with @xmath10 18 and @xmath11 0.5 we calculated fourier periodograms in the range 0 to 20  d@xmath12 .",
    "light curves of stars showing dominant periods shorter than 0.35  d were checked in detail .",
    "the first three @xmath0  cephei stars in the lmc were found by pigulski & koaczkowski ( 2002 ) in the ogle - ii catalogue of variable candidates ( ebru et al .",
    "the new analysis of the ogle - ii data led us to the discovery of 64 @xmath0 cephei stars including the three we found earlier .",
    "we also used the macho data ( allsman & axelrod 2001 ) .",
    "detected frequencies were confirmed in all stars with the available macho photometry ( @xmath180% of the sample ) . in the final analysis we combined data from both surveys .    in the colour - magnitude diagram of the lmc ( fig .",
    "1 ) @xmath0  cephei stars are located in the range 14 @xmath13 17.5 . the most interesting discovery , however , are the periods detected in these stars ( fig .  2 ) . in 31 out of 64 stars",
    ", we detected only a single mode .",
    "the remaining stars are multiperiodic with up to five modes detected .",
    "an example of a multiperiodic @xmath0  cephei star is shown in the amplitude spectra in fig .  3 .",
    "2 shows several interesting features : ( i ) short periods in the lmc @xmath0  cephei stars are generally longer than in the galactic ones .",
    "the median value is 0.17  d for the galaxy and 0.27  d for the lmc .",
    "( ii ) there is a correlation between periods and magnitudes among stars with 16.0 @xmath14 17.5 .",
    "we expect this type of behaviour , because for a given mode the period generally lenghtens with increasing radius .",
    "( iii ) in 20 stars we detected periods which are 1.7  2.2 times longer than the short period(s ) .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "2 as open squares and seem to follow some period - magnitude relation too .",
    "such long periods have not been observed in the galactic @xmath0  cephei stars . they can probably be explained in terms of the low - order @xmath2 modes , so the stars can be regarded as both @xmath0  cephei and spb stars .",
    "in addition to the above - mentioned @xmath0  cephei stars showing spb - type behaviour , we found some ` classical ' spb stars in the lmc , that is multiperiodic stars showing only periods longer than @xmath10.5  d. an example of an early b - type spb star is shown in fig .  3 , but we also found such stars among late b - type stars ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the complete search for spb stars in the lmc is not yet finished because it requires the analysis of thousands of fainter stars and also bright stars with periods longer than 0.35  d. this work is in progress now and will be published separately .",
    "despite the large number of variable stars we found , the incidence of @xmath0  cephei stars in the lmc is clearly lower than in the galaxy .",
    "this confirms the strong dependence of the driving mechanism on metallicity .",
    "a detailed modelling of the observed periods , especially the long periods found in @xmath0  cephei stars , will probably allow constraints to be put on the metallicities and evolutionary status of these variables in the lmc .",
    "furthermore , we will extend our analysis both to longer periods and fainter stars .",
    "this will surely lead to the discovery of a large number of spb stars , but will also increase the number of stars showing simultaneously @xmath0  cephei and spb - type pulsations .",
