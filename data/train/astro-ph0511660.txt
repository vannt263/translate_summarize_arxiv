    "the comoving @xmath8 decreased allowing comoving scales to cross out the causal horizon .",
    "physical information of the inflaton and of the space - time quantum fluctuations contained on those scales was effectively ` frozen ' .",
    "this way , when the scales crossed @xmath8 back later during the era of standard ( non - accelerated ) expansion , the whole observable universe was seed with statistically uniform curvature perturbations for large - scale structure formation .",
    "these seeds served also as initial conditions for the evolution of cmbr anisotropies .",

    ", what all the methods for solving the ip@xmath20 do ( with the remarkable exception of the full - numerical method ) is , essentially , to start by looking for the combinations of @xmath15 that gives the best fit to those primordial spectra .",
    "these combinations are constrained by the form and order of the approximated expressions for the spectra of density and metrics fluctuations .",
    "note that , following definitions ( [ eq : hff ] ) , the number @xmath21 of horizon - flow functions is directly related to the order of the corresponding expressions . in its turn , the order of the predicted spectra is constrained by the finite precision of data .",
    "now , according with expansion ( [ eq : dh ] ) , specifying the set @xmath22 is equivalent to specifying @xmath17 .",
    "so , the unavoidable truncation of @xmath22 corresponds to an incomplete knowledge of the evolution of the hubble horizon .",
    "the next step in the ip@xmath20 solution is to use eqs.([eq : kgphi ] ) and ( [ eq : feq ] ) , or the approximations ( [ eq : ev ] ) , to find the functional form of the inflaton potential corresponding to that approximated behavior of @xmath23 .",
    "the reliability of solving the ip@xmath20 for a potential as constrained by measurement errors was directly tested in refs .",

    "they give us complementary information about possible troubles for observing the potential ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "though the results are in general encouraging , it must be noted that each of them uses in their analysis a fixed order for the slow - roll expansion of the primordial spectra . this is a formal expansion , hence there is not rigorous proof that it converges so , there is not certainty about the solution of the inverse problem based on this expansion to be robust . by",
    "_ robust _ we mean that , while increasing the order of the underlying expressions , the ip@xmath20 solution must converge to a unique functional form .",
    "this robustness is required in order to make definite statements about the high energy physics linked to the observed inflaton potential .    in this sense , the preliminary analysis presented in ref .",
    "@xcite gave us a first cautionary warning about the possible existence of troubles for the robust solution of the ip@xmath20 when the slow - roll approximation is used .",
    "the aim of this paper is to step forward in the analysis of the robustness of the reconstruction of the inflaton potential with regards to the convergence of the horizon - flow expansion for the spectra of inflationary perturbations under the slow - roll approximation . with",
    "that in mind , in the next section we will derive the basic equation for our analysis , a second order linear non - autonomous non - homogeneous differential equation obtained from the comparison between equations for the inflationary perturbations to first and second order in the horizon - flow expansion .",
    "in sec.[sec : math ] we will present mathematical evidence pointing to the non - existence of bounded solutions for this equation if the time variation of the coefficients is required to be consistent with the inflationary cosmology .",
    "we reinforce that conclusion in sec.[sec : phys ] , based on the analysis of inflationary models belonging to the prototypical classes introduced in ref .",
    "finally , in sec.[sec : disc ] we discuss our results .",
    "for finding the functional form of the inflaton potential all the methods mentioned in the introduction use the same kind of expressions for the spectra of scalar perturbations .",
    "nevertheless , early in the research on the ip@xmath20 it was realized that the rle of tensor perturbations deserves also attention if a unique solution to that problem is desired  @xcite .",
    "the information on these modes in the available data is so far rather poor  @xcite .",
    "that is why all the studies but the so - called stewart - lyth inverse problem  @xcite avoided to deal with the tensor equations .",
    "however , the quality of the data on the tensor modes could be radically improved if a number of interesting experiments manages to see the primordial light ( see for instances refs .",
    "even more , studies based on the parametric method have shown that even a poor information on the spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves allows for breaking the degeneracy in the solution of the ip@xmath20 and for obtaining interesting results  @xcite .",
    "particularly , in ref .  @xcite it was shown how using the ratio of the amplitudes of the tensor and scalar perturbations , @xmath24 as input for the ip@xmath20 can be a very fruitful way of taking into account the available observational information on both types of spectra to observe the convexity of the potential during inflation . to do that it is necessary to solve the differential equation ( recall the definitions ( [ eq : hff ] ) for the @xmath15 ) , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a constant and @xmath27 this equation can be derived from the second order expressions for the amplitudes of the scalar and tensor perturbations obtained using the slow - roll approximation  @xcite .",
    "( it can also be derived following the lines described in ref .",

    "@xcite for an example of such an output ) will differ only in small features from the output of the problem with the same input but taking into account all terms in ( [ eq : r_r0 ] ) . to assess this small departure , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we introduce a quantity @xmath29 such that @xmath30 where the ` s ' denotes the horizon - flow functions in the set to be found if second order terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : r_r0 ] ) were used .",
    "the standard notation remains for the set found with up to first order terms .",
    "next , using definitions ( [ eq : hff ] ) it can be obtained @xmath31    now , by definition @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 satisfy identically the first order version of eq .",

    "equations like ( [ eq : main ] ) are usually found in mechanical problems like the study of vibrations . as in mechanics , @xmath39 is going to be called here the ` damping ' of the system , @xmath41 the ` stiffness ' , while @xmath40 will be referred as the ` forcing ' .",
    "first of all , we recall that the formal solution of eq .",

    "this means that they vary slowly with @xmath35 .",
    "so , without lost of generality , we can assume the forcing @xmath40 to be bounded .",
    "in that case , boundedness of ( [ eq : gensol ] ) requires boundedness of solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : mainhom ] ) .",
    "the necessary conditions for the existence of bounded solutions of this equation with undetermined coefficients is still an open problem .",
    "nevertheless , there are inferences that can be drawn for the case of a stiffness strictly negative for all @xmath35 .",
    "such a stiffness is usually considered as a signal of instability of the trivial solution of the above equation .",
    "the reason is that for the corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ eq : mainhom ] ) planar system , @xmath47 the eigenvalues @xmath48 point to a saddle - like instability for any given value of @xmath35 .",
    "if these eigenvalues are slowly changing , then the system is assumed to have no bounded ( finite ) solutions . a rigorous foundation of this folk theorem is still missing together with a precise definition of ` slowly changing '",
    "however , lyapunov s direct method reveals that , for the existence of bounded solutions to equation ( [ eq : mainhom ] ) for all @xmath38 , the following conditions are close to necessary  @xcite : the damping @xmath39 should be positive ( at least asymptotically ) and should increase in an exponential rate .",
    "as it was already mentioned , this last condition is incompatible with all physically meaningful inflationary scenarios .",
    "to consolidate the analysis in the previous section , let us see how the solutions of equation ( [ eq : main ] ) behave for physical situations . to cover as much as possible the space of inflationary scenarios we will use one model from each of the classes introduced in ref .",
    "we choose that classification because it involves only exact expressions .",
    "then , the classifying criteria are not dependent on the order of the horizon - flow expansion , contrary to what happens in the more frequently used small - field / large - field / hybrid models classification  @xcite .",
    "this was realized first by schwarz and terrero  @xcite and recently confirmed by kinney and riotto  @xcite .",

    "note that the value of @xmath77 does not modify the qualitative behavior of these solutions , while the value of @xmath78 does not play any rle at all .",
    "hence , we can conclude that for this kind of models the solution obtained to second order in the horizon - flow functions will typically depart from the lowest orders solutions .",
    "the phase diagrams for the damping and forcing given correspondingly by ( [ eq : diii ] ) and ( [ eq : fiii ] ) , or by ( [ eq : di ] ) and ( [ eq : fi ] ) , are topologically equivalent to that in figure [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "therefore , it is confirmed the result in the previous section about solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : main ] ) diverging around a saddle - point near the origin , as the generic dynamical pattern for those cases which are interesting from the point of view of inflationary cosmology .",
    "the rigorous conclusion to be drawn from the results presented in this paper is that solutions of the inverse problem for the inflaton potential obtained using expressions up to second order in the slow - roll approximation will be generically very different from those solutions obtained using lower order expressions .",
    "it may happen that including higher orders helps to get rid of this trouble .",
    "however , the order of the expressions used to predict the inflationary spectra is determined by the accuracy of the data from the observations of the cmbr anisotropies and large - scale matter distribution . as it has been pointed out , second order expressions will indeed match the precision of current and near future measurements  @xcite . in order words , in the expressions for the amplitudes of the inflationary spectra , horizon - flow functions with orders higher than @xmath79 would not contain any useful information .",
    "therefore , including such orders would be irrelevant for the output of the inverse problem .",
    "note now that equation ( [ eq : main ] ) has trivial solution @xmath80 only for the cases of de sitter ( where @xmath81 for @xmath46 ) and power - law inflation  @xcite . in this last model @xmath82 ( with a constant @xmath83 ) , implying @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath81 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "here @xmath88 is a real constant which is zero for a universe dominated by a cosmological constant .",
    "therefore , @xmath29 actually measures the depart from an exponential of the functional form of the output potential .",
    "power - law inflation is the unique model which predicts exact power laws for the amplitudes of both the tensor and scalar spectra  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the comoving wavenumber and @xmath77 is a constant called the spectral index .",
    "moreover , during power - law inflation the scalar index @xmath91 is equal to the tensor @xmath92 , what implies a constant ratio of tensor to scalar amplitudes , @xmath93 .",
    "conversely , in ref .  @xcite it was proved that using power - law spectra as input in the inverse problem renders the exponential potential as the unique output . from this point of view",
    ", @xmath29 measures the depart of the behavior of the inflationary spectra from a power - law .",
    "we can conclude that the essence of the troubles for observing the inflaton potential is the weak signal in the cmbr of scale - dependence of the primordial spectra and the difficulties to extract that information from data using expressions for the inflationary perturbations based on the slow - roll approximation .    as a matter of fact",
    ", we were able to clarify here a point which evidences can be traced back in the existing research literature . in 1995 , lidsey et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the results for the spectra obtained to first order in the slow - roll approximation by stewart and lyth  @xcite could be understood as an expansion about the exact solution for power - law inflation .",
    "two years later , wang et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed the implications that finite orders in such an expansion have for precisely predicting the inflationary spectra .",
    "limitations pointed out were linked to the bessel and horizon - crossing approximations .",
    "martin et al .",
    "@xcite quantified these limitations by comparing a power - law parametrization for the amplitudes with a more general taylor series parametrization , and by analyzing the impact of the variation of the pivot scale on the accuracy of predictions .",
    "the larger the scale - dependence of the spectra , the bigger is this impact ( see also ref .",
    "the combination of the bessel and slow - roll approximations is no longer needed to calculate the primordial spectra , and the power - law parametrization has been extended to included the running of the scalar index . however , the slow - roll condition remains on the basis of the expressions that usually link the taylor parametrized spectra and the inflationary predictions .",
    "there is evidence that the above mentioned limitations still persist .",
    "comparing approximated and numerical predictions for three given models , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was noted that increasing the order of the horizon - flow functions beyond the quadratic in every included term of the taylor parametrization of primordial spectra does not significantly improve the accuracy of the approximations .",
    "in fact , adding terms in that parametrization actually seems to be most important for increasing the precision of the predictions . however , the number of terms in the parametrization depends on the capability of the observations to measure a significant departure from scale - invariance in the primordial spectra . as a final evidence",
    ", we recall that using first order expressions for @xmath93 and @xmath91 , dodelson et al .",
    "were able to discriminate among inflationary models with decreasing and increasing kinetic energy density by distributing them in the @xmath94 plane  @xcite . as it was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , including higher order corrections makes impossible to distinguish between these models on the basis of a @xmath95 plot , unless the running of the spectral index is known or constrained to be very small .",
    "the same conclusion was recently made by kinney and riotto  @xcite .",
    "limitations from theoretical and observational sides to account for the scale - dependence of the primordial spectra have been misunderstood as generic predictions of inflation . that this scale - dependence is in the edge of observational capabilities does not means that all the successful inflaton potentials must resemblance an exponential during the inflationary era , but just that we are unable so far to observe the difference .",
    "the findings by hoffman and turner  @xcite about power - law inflation as an @xmath96-attractor ( attractor in the future ) of the flow in the space of inflationary models were constrained by the order of the expressions in their analysis . as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , departure from power - law behavior is nullified whenever the leading order is used . to first order , for instance",
    ", it remains true that the inflationary dynamics yielding a constant tensor index @xmath92 has power - law inflation as an @xmath96-attractor  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is also true that the inflationary dynamics characterized by a constant ratio @xmath93 , has power - law inflation as an @xmath97-attractor ( attractor in the past or repellor )  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in ref .  @xcite it was shown how a minimal scale - dependence for @xmath93 ( and information on such a scale - dependence can be drawn from the difference between both spectral indices ) allows for models with power - law inflation as a transient regime . based on these facts , we conjecture here that , if using higher orders in the slow - roll expansion for the analysis of the inflationary flow , power - law inflation still arises as a fixed point , then it will do it like a saddle - point , consistently with the results presented in this paper .    summarizing , either the slow - roll expansion does not converge or it does so slowly that a large number of terms in this expansion is required to probe the scale dependence of the primordial spectra .",
    "nevertheless , information on this dependence seems to be a necessary ingredient for a robust solution to the inflaton potential inverse problem .",
    "this conclusion should encourage further development of the full - numerical method for the resolution of this inverse problem  @xcite , as well as of other analytical methods , for instance , those based on the wkb  @xcite approximation , on the uniform approximation  @xcite , and on the inverse - scattering theory  @xcite .",
