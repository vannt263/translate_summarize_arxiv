    "on september 2015 , the gravitational - wave ( gw ) was directly detected by the advanced laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( aligo ) for the first time @xcite .",
    "the detected gw , labeled by gw150914 , was the signal from the inspiral and merger of two black holes with the masses of about 30 @xmath2 .",
    "the signal was the first evidence of the binary black hole merger .",
    "as another event of black hole merger , gw151226 , had been detected @xcite , further details of binary black hole systems , such as distribution and population of black holes , might be revealed by further observations .",
    "while aligo detected the transients with the durations of a few hundreds milliseconds , a longer observations of the binary systems would provide much information of the binary systems , such as spins of black holes .",
    "binary systems with the masses of about 30 @xmath2 emit gws with the frequencies of about 0.1 hz at 15 days before the merger .",
    "such a long term observation of the gw signals from the binary systems would effectively solve the degeneracy of the parameters , such as their spins , which is expected to be a clue about the evolution of the black holes @xcite .",
    "in addition to the black holes with the masses of the order of 10 @xmath2 , it is important to search for black holes with various masses .",
    "observation of various black hole mergers would elucidate the evolution process of super - massive black holes . in order to observe the gw signals from binary systems with various masses",
    ", it is necessary to observe gws at various frequencies .",
    "binaries with heavier masses emit gws at lower frequencies than the observation band of the interferometers .    a torsion - bar antenna ( toba ) @xcite is a gravitaional - wave ( gw ) detector that is sensitive to gws at around 1 hz , while the observation band of interferometric gw detectors , such as ligo , are above about 10 hz .",
    "one of the astronomical targets of toba is intermediate - mass black hole binaries .",
    "the space - borne interferometric detectors , such as laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) @xcite and deci - herz gravitational - wave observatory ( decigo ) @xcite , would also have the observation frequency band below 10 hz . comparing to such detectors",
    ", toba can be realized on the ground with an accessibility for repair and upgrade , and without risk for large cost .",
    "though the final target sensitivity of toba is not as good as space detectors , the observation range is expected to be as far as 10 gpc with the luminosity distance for the intermediate - mass black hole mergers .",
    "toba has two bar - shaped test masses which are suspended at their centers .",
    "gws are detected by monitoring their relative rotation excited by the tidal force from gws . since the resonant frequencies of the test masses in the torsional modes are as low as a few mhz , toba has sensitivity at low frequencies even on the ground . as a proof of concept ,",
    "the first prototype of toba had been developed with a single test mass bar @xcite and set the first upper limit on a stochastic gw background from 0.03 to 0.8 hz @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is necessary to use more than three detectors in order to determine the parameters of binaries , such as masses of the objects , polarization angle , and the sky position of the source because the conventional detectors have poor directivity @xcite .",
    "therefore , we proposed _ the multi - output toba _ , which provides three independent signals from a single detector by monitoring multiple rotational degrees of freedom of the test masses @xcite .",
    "the multi - output system improves the event rate and the angular resolution , which would enhance the low - frequency gw astronomy even with fewer detectors .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce the first multi - output toba detector .",
    "its main feature is the new suspension system for the multi - output configuration , which also performs as a vibration isolation system . in the section [ sec : toba ] , we explain its principle and the target sensitivity .",
    "the detector configuration that we developed is described in the section [ sec : detector ] .",
    "its characteristics is mentioned in the following section .",
    "toba has two bar - shaped test masses that rotate differentially by the tidal force from gws as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : toba ] @xcite .    schematic view of the toba test masses.,width=264 ]    the equation of the motion of the test mass bar in the rotational mode is @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are angular fluctuation , the moment of inertia , the damping constant , and the spring constant around @xmath6-axis , respectively .",
    "@xmath7 is the amplitude of the gw , and @xmath8 is the dynamical quadrupole moment of the test mass for the rotation along the @xmath6 axis .",
    "the frequency response of the angular fluctuation of the test mass is derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom ] ) as @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the loss angle and the amplitude of the gw coming along @xmath6-axis with the polarizations of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "@xmath14 is the resonant frequency of the torsional mode , above which the angular fluctuation due to the gw is approximated to be independent from its frequency .    in the multi - output system",
    ", we also consider rotations of the bars on the vertical planes . considering the test mass 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : toba ] , the angular fluctuation along the @xmath15-axis also obeys the similar equation as eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom ] ) : @xmath16 it means that the bar also rotates vertically due to gws coming along @xmath15-axis .",
    "therefore , we can derive two independent signals @xmath17 and @xmath18 from the single test mass bar .    since we have two orthogonal test mass bars , it is possible to derive three independent signals from the single detector , i.e. , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , where the suffix indicates the two test masses .",
    "the sensitivity to gw signal derived from @xmath17 , calculated as @xmath22 , would be better by @xmath23 than the sensitivity derived only from one of the rotational signals , when the noise appeared in @xmath24 , and @xmath21 are un - correlated and the same level . this multi - output system would increase the expected detection rate by about 1.7 times , since the three signals have different sensitive areas in the sky . also , parameter estimation accuracy for short - duration signals would be improved since the three independent information helps to break the degeneracies of the parameters @xcite .",
    "the final target sensitivity of toba is about @xmath25 @xmath1 in strain at 1 hz as described in @xcite , which is limited mainly by the shot noise , the radiation pressure noise , and gravity gradient noise .",
    "this sensitivity can be achieved by sensing the rotation of large cryogenic test mass bars with the length of 10 m , using fabry - perot interferometer .",
    "the test mass bars and the suspension wires should be cooled down in order to reduce the thermal noise . since several advanced technologies are necessary for the final toba configuration , it is required to develop each component using prototypes .",
    "the first prototype toba had been developed previously @xcite .",
    "the first prototype has a single bar shaped test mass with a magnetic levitation system in order to suspend the test mass softly in the rotational degree of freedom .",
    "the test mass has the length of 20 cm , and its horizontal rotation is measured by a michelson interferometer , which means that it has the single - output configuration .",
    "it successfully tested the basic principle of toba , and set the first upper limit on a stochastic gravitational - wave background at 0.2 hz @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of the first prototype toba is limited by the magnetic noise induced by the magnetic suspension system , and the seismic noise coupling .    as a next step ,",
    "we have developed a multi - output toba , as described in the following sections .",
    "its main target is the development of the suspension system that realizes the multi - output system .",

    "this design is implemented since it may reduce the noise caused from the common rotational displacements of the bars .",
    "the common mode noise reduction rate is expected to be large when the sensitivity is limited by the environmental disturbance that effects the test mass rotations commonly , while the reduction rate is @xmath23 in strain at the minimum when the noise sources of the two signals are independent .",
    "the resonant frequency in the horizontal rotational mode is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the mass of the test mass , the acceleration of gravity , the distance between the two suspension wires as shown in fig.[fig : testmass ] , moment of inertia of the test mass , and the length of the wire , respectively .",
    "the resonant frequency in the vertical rotational mode is written as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the height distance between the suspension points and the center of mass as shown in fig.[fig : testmass ] .",
    "the suspension points of the test masses are set to be close to their center of mass in order to minimize the resonant frequency of the vertical rotation . in our set up ,",
    "the resonant frequency of the horizontal and vertical rotational modes are 0.10 hz and 0.15 hz , respectively .",
    "the resonant frequencies are set at around 100 mhz in our prototype in order to realize the new suspension system with the compact setup .",
    "the resonant frequencies would be pushed down by using larger test masses in the future upgrade in order to widen the observation band .",
    "the main sensors that we used for the observation in the multi - output toba are the michelson interferometeric sensors .",
    "the motion of the bar is monitored by measuring the phase shift of the beam reflected by the mirrors attached at the bar .",
    "since it is necessary to have several sensors around the test masses in order to monitor three independent rotational signals , the fiber optics are used for the space saving .",

    "the test masses , and the optical table where the sensors and actuators are set , are suspended in order to attenuate the seismic motion above resonant frequencies of those pendulum modes",
    ". however , since the resonant frequencies of the pendulum modes are about 1 hz , an additional seismic isolation system for low frequencies are necessary for toba .",

    "the vibration of the top table is suppressed by the feedback control using six seismometers ( l-4c geophones , products of sercel ) set on the top plate and the pzts .",
    "note that reflective type position sensors are used in order to measure the dc position of the top table relative to the ground since the lack of the sensitivity of seismometers at low frequencies causes drift of the top table .",

    "also the avit is effective to attenuate the vibration of the heat link in the cryogenic system for thermal noise reduction that is planned to be implemented in the future upgrade .",

    "<S> we have developed a new gravitaional - wave ( gw ) detector , torsion - bar antenna ( toba ) , with multiple - output configuration . </S>",
    "<S> toba is a detector with bar - shaped test masses that rotate by the tidal force of the gws . in our detector , </S>",
    "<S> three independent information about the gw signals can be derived by monitoring multiple rotational degrees of freedom , i.e. , horizontal rotations and vertical rotations of the bars . </S>",
    "<S> since the three outputs have different antenna pattern functions , the multi - output system improves the detection rate and the parameter estimation accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> it is effective in order to obtain further details of the gw sources , such as population and directions . </S>",
    "<S> we successfully operated the multi - output detector continuously for more than 24 hours with stable data quality . </S>",
    "<S> also , the sensitivity of one of the signals is improved to be @xmath0 @xmath1 at 3 hz by the combination of the passive and active vibration isolation systems , while sensitivities to possible gw signals derived from the vertical rotations are worse than that from the horizontal rotation . </S>"
