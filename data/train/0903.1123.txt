    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) of a galaxy is one of the drivers of its evolution , and the composition of the ism determines many of the characteristics of the next generation of stars .",
    "the ism is itself continuously renewed and enriched by stellar ejecta .",
    "the enrichment occurs as stars evolve and die , either exploding as supernovae ( sne ) or experiencing intense mass loss in a super - wind .",
    "super - winds occur in low and intermediate mass stars during the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase ( main sequence masses in the approximate range 18@xmath4 ) , and in more massive red supergiants .",
    "the ejecta are enriched with elements produced in various phases of nuclear burning",
    ". in general terms , gas ejected from sne includes newly synthesised heavy elements , such as oxygen , iron and silicon @xcite , while agb stars ( below 8@xmath4 ) synthesize lighter elements , especially carbon and nitrogen @xcite .",
    "the chemical evolution of the gas can be well understood in terms of the different stellar sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "dust forms in stellar ejecta at temperatures of about 10001500k and at high densities .",
    "different stars produce different types of dust .",
    "red supergiants produce oxygen - rich ( silicate ) dust .",
    "agb stars have two distinct chemical types : oxygen- and carbon - rich , depending on the abundance ratio of oxygen and carbon atoms within their atmospheres .",
    "oxygen - rich stars form silicate dust , while carbon - rich stars yield amorphous carbon , graphite and sic dust .",
    "supernovae can produce both dust types , depending on the abundances in the different layers of the ejecta @xcite .",
    "the current rate of ism enrichment by dust and gas depends on the total stellar population , the initial mass function and the star - forming history ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "type ii sne are expected to dominate the enrichment in the early phases of galaxy evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite argue that dust grains injected from sne into the ism accelerate star formation in young galaxies .",
    "it takes more than 100myr for the first intermediate - mass stars to evolve onto the agb ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , dust and gas enrichment from agb stars occurs later than from high - mass stars .",
    "different galaxies , at different stages of this process , may be expected to show differences in gas - to - dust ratios , dust content , and , in consequence , ism dust extinction curves .    in our galaxy ,",
    "the major dust sources are presumed to be agb stars and sne @xcite .",
    "some other sources , such as wolf - rayet stars and novae , also contribute dust to the ism of the milky way , but only in small quantities @xcite .",
    "the relative importance of agb stars and sne remains uncertain .",
    "@xcite suggests that sne are important silicate dust sources , while most carbonaceous dust grains are from carbon - rich agb stars .",
    "@xcite show that agb stars are an important gas source within our galaxy , except in the galactic plane where sne appear to dominate .",
    "the dust formation efficiency in sne remains controversial ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , since sn shocks also destroy dust @xcite and since dust production prior the explosion remains unclear .",
    "there are also uncertainties in the dust formation efficiencies for agb stars .",
    "this is expected to depend on the mass - loss rate , chemical type , and metallicity . for oxygen - rich stars",
    "mass - loss rates decrease towards lower metallicity @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for carbon - rich stars , although the metallicity dependence of mass - loss rates is still unclear @xcite , there does not appear to be any obvious metallicity dependence in the range from solar , down to one - twentieth of the solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "however , we would expect the mass - loss rates of carbon stars to differ between environments with different abundances of alpha elements . in these cases",
    "the initial abundance of oxygen in the carbon - star precursor would be vital in determining how much carbon must be dredged up before any was free to become dust .",
    "galaxy evolution models aim at fitting the current composition of the ism by following the evolution of the stellar population over the lifetime of the galaxy .",

    "@xcite argue that , for carbon - rich agb stars , the gas - to - dust ratio only marginally depends on the metallicity of the host galaxy .",
    "this is because carbon atoms are synthesised in agb stars , and the quantity of amorphous carbon ( or graphite ) produced depends on the number of excess carbon atoms in the atmosphere of the agb star after all the oxygen atoms are locked into the stable carbon monoxide molecule .",
    "various observations suggest no obvious differences in mass - loss rates for carbon - rich agb stars amongst the lmc , the smc and the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy @xcite ; the time variations and uncertainties of the mass - loss rates appear to be larger than any metallicity effects .",

    "@xcite and @xcite and argued that the mass - loss rate of carbon stars is primarily determined by the difference in the numbers of carbon and oxygen atoms : as the excess carbon is self produced by the agb star , carbon stars will show relatively little difference in mass - loss rates between different galaxies , although for low metallicity systems the mass loss may begin earlier on the agb phase @xcite .",
    "note that this will apply only to carbon - rich agb stars ; the mass loss of oxygen - rich agb stars is likely to show a strong metallicity dependence @xcite .    in the process of estimating the mass - loss rate @xcite , an outflow velocity of the circumstellar envelope",
    "is assumed . for oxygen - rich stars , lower outflow velocities are found @xcite , but the gas velocity has never measured for carbon - rich stars in the lmc .",
    "theoretical models @xcite suggest that the mean velocity does not depend on metallicity for carbon - rich stars . @xcite assumed a gas velocity of 10kms@xmath27 , while @xcite used 812kms@xmath27 .",
    "the other uncertainty originates from the assumption that the dust condensation temperature is 1000k @xcite .",
    "this is a similar value as used for galactic stars @xcite .",
    "however , for example , the condensation temperature of graphite dust grains varies with carbon - to - oxygen ( c / o ) ratio @xcite , and at a c / o ratio of 1.2 , the temperature is 1700k .",
    "it has been suggested that the c / o ratio of carbon - rich stars in the lmc is systematically higher than in their galactic counterparts @xcite .",
    "this has also been suggested from the observations of pne in the lmc and the smc @xcite . to account for c / o ratio variations and to test their influence of the dust condensation temperature on mass - loss rate , we tested radiative transfer modelling of the sed fitting , with dust condensation temperatured of 1000k , 1200k , 1300k and 1700k .",
    "we used the spectrum of one of the highest mass - loss rate stars , 050231.49@xmath8680535.8 ( j2000 ) , observed by @xcite .",
    "the result shows that both the fitted optical depth and expansion velocity increase with dust condensation temperature .",
    "the mass - loss rate required to fit the sed could be a factor of 2.4 higher , if the dust condensation temperature increases from 1000k to 1700k , although the numerical error is large for the models with dust condensation temperature above 1300k .",
    "this suggests that the mass - loss rate , which is estimated from infrared colour , could be underestimated by a factor of up to 2.4 , systematically . in the overall analysis",
    ", we give the results under the assumption of 1000k dust condensation temperature , however , in the final gas and dust budget , we include this potential increase .",
    "agb stars are long period variables , whose magnitudes vary over a 1001000 day time scale .",
    "the amplitudes of the infrared variability are smaller than those of optical variabilities : they range from 0.2 to 1.5mag at @xmath28-band ( 3@xmath6 m ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , mass - loss rates of agb stars vary over time scales of 1000years @xcite .",
    "the cause of long - term mass - loss rate variations are still unknown @xcite .",
    "the variability affects our analysis for individual sourcs , but are averaged in the full , large sample .      to estimate the integrated mass - loss rates from carbon - rich agb stars , it is essential to find a classification scheme that will separate carbon - rich from oxygen - rich stars . in particular , oxygen - rich agb stars and red supergiants ( rsgs ) follow different mass - loss rate vs. colour relations from carbon - rich stars @xcite and",

    "this suggests that most of these stars belong to a similar population .",
    "contamination by non - lmc objects , i.e. , distant galaxies , should be minimal ; the number density of distant galaxies is almost uniform and thus the number counted should be proportional to the area examined .",

    "this may suggest that the location of active star forming regions has not changed significantly over the past 0.51gyrs .",

    "fig.[fig - jk - k ] shows a @xmath14 vs @xmath108 colour magnitude diagram for the lmc stars from the sage catalogue .",
    "the coding of the chemical types of the stars is given in the figure .",
    "there are five branches within @xmath109 .",
    "carbon - rich stars are found in the reddest of these branches ( @xmath110 ) , as is known from previous studies @xcite . from @xmath111 to 2.0mag there is a bend in the carbon - rich branch and the @xmath108-mag becomes brighter with colour .",
    "this branch reaches its brightest @xmath108-mag at about @xmath112 , after which @xmath108 becomes fainter .",
    "the number density also decreases redward of @xmath112 .",
    "stars with @xmath113 are described as obscured agb stars by @xcite , and in our sample most of these are carbon - rich , but oxygen - rich stars are also found here . following the classification by @xcite ( @xmath114 and @xmath115 ) , only 17 percent of the stars are redder than @xmath113 .",
    "this shows that less than one - sixth of carbon - stars have a circumstellar envelope detectable in the @xmath108-band .",
    "this is consistent with the stellar evolution model by @xcite , who showed that the super - wind phase ( with mass - loss rate higher than @xmath116 ) lasts less than 15 percent of the thermal - pulsing lifetime for carbon - stars .",
    "the 2mass sensitivity is not sufficiently high to detect dusty carbon - rich agb stars in some bands .",
    "figs.[fig - j3 - 3 ] and [ fig - k8-k ] show that 2mass does not detect the @xmath11- and @xmath108-bands at the red end of the carbon - rich sequence",
    ". however , this red end is clearly detected at [ 5.8 ] and [ 8.0 ] ( fig.[fig-38 - 8 ] and fig.[fig-58 - 8 ] ) .",
    "the situation will change once the vista lmc survey of the magellanic system is completed , which could detect as faint as = 20.3mag @xcite .",
    "oxygen - rich stars are mainly found at @xmath338mag and @xmath117 .",
    "these stars are a mixture of red giants and red - super giants @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that oxygen - rich agb stars are found in the branch located at about @xmath1189mag and @xmath117 . in our analysis ( fig.[fig - jk - k ] ) , there are two regions with oxygen - rich stars .",
    "one is the same as identified by @xcite .",
    "the other is occupied by oxygen - rich stars with think dust shell , which are just above the obscured carbon - rich sequence . there are two oxygen - rich stars with lower luminosity than the others ( @xmath11813mag ; @xmath14=1.52.0 ) : l63 - 31(sage 045433.86@xmath8692036.1 ) and msxlmx610 .",
    "their low luminosities and some excess at near - infrared wavelengths suggest that they could be oxygen - rich post - agb candidates or yso candidates .",
    "post - agb stars with optical variability show similar @xmath14 and -magnitudes @xcite .",
    "the possibility that they are ysos is not discarded , but if so the @xmath119 mag implies a relatively high mass ( between 5 and 10@xmath4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "fig.[fig - j3 - 3 ] shows the @xmath120 $ ] vs @xmath24 $ ] colour magnitude diagram , used by @xcite , in which the separation of oxygen- and carbon - rich agb stars is clear .",
    "oxygen - rich stars have oh in the @xmath11-band , and most mira variables have h@xmath84o in @xmath121- and @xmath28-bands @xcite .",
    "carbon - rich stars have hcn and c@xmath84h@xmath84 bands at 3.1@xmath6 m @xcite and cn in the @xmath11- and @xmath122-bands @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity is limited by the @xmath11-band , and heavily dust - obscured agb stars are not detected . in fig.[fig - jk - k ] optically identified carbon stars listed by @xcite reach the brightest mag .",
    "the magnitudes become fainter as the stars become redder in @xmath14 , as they do among the more obscured carbon stars classified by spitzer irs . in contrast , such a trend is not found in fig.[fig - j3 - 3 ] ; the [ 3.6 ] magnitude continues to brighten among obscured carbon stars beyond the @xmath11-band detection limit , as would be expected .",
    "fig.[fig - k8-k ] is a colour - magnitude diagram showing @xmath25 $ ] vs @xmath108 . in this",
    "carbon - rich stars become fainter in @xmath108 as circumstellar reddening changes the colour ; @xmath108 reaches a peak of @xmath123mag around @xmath25= 2$]4mag .",
    "oxygen - rich stars have slightly higher luminosity in at a given colour , except for the two oxygen - rich post - agb / yso candidates . in this diagram ,",
    "oxygen - rich stars are well separated from carbon - rich stars .",
    "lmc carbon - rich stars have hcn and c@xmath84h@xmath84 absorption bands at 7@xmath6 m @xcite in the [ 8.0]-band ( 6.59.5@xmath6 m ) while oxygen - rich stars have only weak sio absorption and silicate excess in the [ 8.0]-band , until the silicate band turns to absorption .",
    "these spectral differences separate the two chemical types in this colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "this diagram also shows that high mass - loss rate carbon - rich stars could have @xmath108-band magnitudes fainter than 15mag , i.e. , below the detection limit of the 2mass @xmath108-band .",
    "high mass - loss rate stars are likely to be detected at longer wavelength , as is illustrated in the spitzer sage colour - magnitude diagrams discussed below .",
    "figs.[fig-58 - 8 ] and [ fig-824 - 8 ] show colour - magnitude diagrams using the sage [ 5.8]- , [ 8.0]- and [ 24]-bands . in these two figures",
    "the sequence of irs - classified carbon - rich stars does not end at the detection limits .",
    "thus all of the red , i.e. , high mass - loss rate carbon - rich , stars were detected in these bands .",
    "however , there is no clear separation between oxygen - rich and carbon - rich stars so the diagrams are not useful for classification .",
    "@xcite published a @xmath124 survey of the magellanic clouds taken with the infrared survey facility ( irsf ) telescope at saao in south africa .",
    "the sensitivity of this survey , 16.6mag at 10@xmath45 in the band for the lmc , is significantly better than that of 2mass ( 14.3mag ) , although the conversion between irsf and 2mass filter system may not be straightforward for agb stars @xcite .",
    "four of the stars listed in @xcite have been observed with irsf and their mass - loss rate is plotted in fig.[fig - k8-sirius ] .",
    "it appears that irsf stars follow a similar colour mass - loss rate trend .",
    "we will investigate this relation further after the spitzer spectroscopic survey , sage - spec , is complete ."
