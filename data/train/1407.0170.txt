    "experimental investigation and practical use of semiconductor structures in most cases require their nonresonant excitation .",
    "the latter leads to a complex evolution of the electron - hole ( e - h ) system , and this evolution involves several processes @xcite : first , internal thermal equilibrium is established within charge carriers in a time shorter than 1  ps for gaas - based quantum well ( qw ) structures ( considered further in the present paper ) @xcite . when the internal equilibrium has been established , the e - h system is characterized by a temperature @xmath0 greater than the lattice temperature @xmath1 .",
    "second , the e - h system cools down due to the emission of optical ( fast stage ) and acoustical ( slow stage ) phonons @xcite .",
    "both processes are accompanied by the exciton formation .",
    "the characteristic time of the exciton formation ranges from 10  ps to 1  ns and is determined by the e - h density ( see @xcite and references therein ) . for the excitation above the qw barriers the whole evolution is accompanied by the capture of charge carriers to the qws . for sufficiently deep qw states",
    "the capture is relatively fast , with a time of @xmath2  ps , and is assisted by the emission of optical phonons @xcite .",
    "the temperature @xmath0 of the e - h system during its cooldown remains significantly higher than the lattice temperature @xmath1 for several hundreds of picoseconds in the low - temperature experiments @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the dynamics of @xmath0 determines the exciton fraction and many important properties of the system .",
    "an example is bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of excitons , which is hindered in bulk semiconductors and the qws without spatial separation of electrons and holes .",
    "the reason for such a hindrance is insufficiently fast cooling of excitons compared with their recombination and inelastic collisions , the latter leading to the formation of the exciton complexes and e - h liquid @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the temperature dynamics of the reservoir , the e - h system in the qws embedded in a semiconductor microcavity ( mc ) , and the effect of this dynamics on the properties of mc exciton polaritons , mixed exciton - photon states .",
    "this system attracts considerable attention , especially inspired by the achievement of bec of polaritons @xcite and a number of intriguing related phenomena , such as quantized vortices , superfluidity , the josephson effect , etc .",
    "( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the dynamics of the reservoir internal temperature after a short - pulse nonresonant excitation is of primary importance because it determines the possibility of and conditions for the polariton bec .",
    "typically , the internal temperature of the e - h system in bare qw structures is extracted from the boltzmann tail in the photoluminescence ( pl ) spectra , which originates from the e - h plasma recombination .",
    "however , the recombination is rather weak and requires for a reasonable analysis a high e - h density @xcite and high quality of qws @xcite . for the qws embedded in a mc ,",
    "the e - h plasma recombination is even more hindered due to the strong spectrum modification induced by the mc . in some works",
    "the temperature was extracted by analyzing the lower polariton ( lp ) population energy distribution @xcite .",
    "however , the temperature so defined is not the reservoir temperature but , rather , characterizes the degree of nonequilibrium of the low - wave - vector part of the polariton system .    in the present paper , we propose and justify a new method of determining the reservoir temperature from the linewidth of the lower polariton states .",
    "we theoretically derive and experimentally use a general relation for the lp homogeneous linewidth via the rate of polariton escape , used to find the reservoir temperature , and the mean polariton occupation number .",
    "the extracted reservoir temperature in the experiments with nonresonant pulsed excitation of the gaas mc decays from about @xmath3  k at a time of @xmath4  ps after the excitation pulse and relaxes to the lattice temperature @xmath1 in about @xmath5  ns .",
    "the fact that at long times the extracted temperature follows @xmath1 as @xmath1 is changed proves the validity of our method .",
    "we conclude that at the conditions of the polariton bose - einstein condensation in gaas mc structures the reservoir temperature greatly exceeds the lattice temperature .",
    "this leads to increasing the bec threshold and degrading the coherence properties compared with those for the reservoir in thermal equilibrium with the lattice . furthermore , as a result of the large reservoir temperature , bec in gaas mcs under nonresonant pulsed excitation is typically governed by polariton - phonon scattering , while scattering of polaritons by excitons and free charge carriers leads to depopulation of the condensate .",
    "the mc polariton system can be divided into the low-@xmath6 , radiative part ( @xmath6 is a wave vector ) and the high-@xmath6 , nonradiative part , usually referred to as a reservoir . in the radiative part ,",
    "exciton - photon mixing is high , which results in a steep polariton dispersion curve .",
    "this polariton part is strongly nonequilibrium due to the short polariton lifetime determined by the mc @xmath7 factor . on the other hand ,",
    "the nonradiative reservoir , containing almost all of the population of the e - h system , is virtually unaffected by the mc , which can only alter the rate of the reservoir density decay induced by exciton scattering to the leaky low-@xmath6 region @xcite .",
    "all the processes occurring in the e - h system and discussed for bare qw structures in the introduction also take place in the reservoir .",
    "the reservoir determines the population of the low-@xmath6 region .    here",
    ", we determine the lp linewidth .",
    "let us consider a subsystem representing one low-@xmath6 polariton state in the mc .",

    "let us stress in this connection that the subsystem is , in general , in a _ nonequilibrium _ stationary state and that the environment is of the general kind and need not be an equilibrium particle - and - energy bath .",
    "the stationary mean polariton number is @xmath15 the finiteness of which implies @xmath16 .",

    "the rate @xmath13 of polariton escape to the environment is determined by photon escape through the mc mirrors with a rate @xmath39 and polariton scattering assisted by phonons , excitons , and free carriers ( electrons and holes ) with the corresponding rates @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 ; thus , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the photon hopfield coefficient . the rate @xmath46 is independent of the reservoir concentration and temperature and hence is time independent . under the assumption that the reservoir occupation numbers are much less than 1 , @xmath40 is also time independent .",

    "since the reservoir region contains the overwhelming majority of the states , it is natural to assume that polaritons escape mostly to the reservoir due to the scattering off the reservoir excitons and free carriers .",

    "an interesting conclusion can immediately be drawn from @xmath175 at bec . according to eq .",

    "the mean polariton number reduces to the bose - einstein distribution @xmath182 - 1\\}^{-1}$ ] when the state interacts solely with the equilibrium reservoir ( which formally corresponds to @xmath183 ) , we have @xmath184 where @xmath97 is the chemical potential for the exciton part of the reservoir .",
    "alternatively , this equation can be derived by calculating @xmath179 and @xmath181 in the born approximation .",
    "it is easy to show that for a nondegenerate reservoir @xmath185 taking the realistic parameters for a gaas structure @xmath186  mev , @xmath187 ( two - dimensional exciton effective mass @xcite ) , where @xmath188 is the free electron mass , @xmath189 , and taking the reservoir temperature @xmath190  k at @xmath191  ps ( fig .  [ figtdyn ] ) , we obtain @xmath192 \\approx n_\\text{x } \\times ( 2 \\times 10^{-12}$ ]  @xmath193 because the polariton bec implies the strong coupling regime and , thus , the unsaturated reservoir , @xmath194 , where the exciton bohr radius is @xmath195  cm . with eq .",
    "( [ eqdetaileq ] ) , we conclude that the rate of polariton scattering to the given state due to interparticle interaction is smaller than the corresponding polariton escape rate : @xmath196 as a result , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eqgeqwmod ] ) is negative ; therefore , polariton escape in the regime of bec is compensated only by the phonon - assisted polariton relaxation .",
    "thus , contrary to the common belief , for nonresonant excitation , interparticle interaction drives polaritons away from the condensate rather than promoting their condensation .",
    "condition ( [ eqwlessg ] ) might be violated for too deep states [ note @xmath192 \\propto \\exp(\\delta\\varepsilon / t)$ ] ] , e.g. , for @xmath197  mev at @xmath198  @xmath115 or @xmath199  mev at @xmath200  @xmath115 .",
    "these values of @xmath87 are relatively large for bec in gaas mcs @xcite but are easily achievable for the mcs based on materials with larger exciton binding energy and rabi splitting , such as cdte @xcite , gan @xcite , and zno @xcite . in this case condition ( [ eqwlessg ] ) can be satisfied at positive photon - exciton detunings in the so - called thermodynamic condensation regime @xcite .",
    "condition ( [ eqwlessg ] ) does not contradict the well - established importance of interparticle interaction in polariton relaxation for relatively high excitation densities for the noncondensed regime @xcite . indeed , in the rate equation the income term describing polariton scattering assisted by interparticle interaction is @xmath201 whereas the corresponding term describing polariton escape is @xmath202 .",
    "for @xmath203 , the income term can dominate despite the condition ( [ eqwlessg ] ) .",
    "the situation is reversed for the regime of condensation , when @xmath204 .",
    "furthermore , our conclusion does not contradict the reported enhancement of polariton relaxation due to reservoir heating @xcite because the value of @xmath181 grows with the reservoir temperature [ eqs .",

    "we have studied theoretically and experimentally the polariton linewidth and have shown that it is determined by the polariton escape rate and polariton population . in experiments with resonant excitation , the dynamics of the polariton linewidth",
    "is mainly governed by the dynamics of the occupation number . by contrast , in experiments with nonresonant excitation , this dynamics is mainly governed by the dynamics of the polariton escape rate , which in turn is governed by the dynamics of the reservoir temperature . on this basis , we have developed a method of determining the reservoir temperature by tracing the dependence of the polariton escape rate on the polariton energy . the extracted reservoir temperature for nonresonant pulsed excitation of a gaas microcavity decays from @xmath205  k at @xmath4  ps to the lattice temperature in a time of @xmath2  ns .",
    "increasing the excitation power leads to a slowdown of the reservoir temperature relaxation .",
    "we have concluded that , in experiments with nonresonant pulsed excitation of gaas microcavities , the reservoir temperature greatly exceeds the lattice temperature in the regime of the polariton bose - einstein condensation . as a result , the condensation is governed by the phonon - assisted polariton relaxation , while the overall effect of interparticle scattering is depopulation of the condensate .",
