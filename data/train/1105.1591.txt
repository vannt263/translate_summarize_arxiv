    "the exact mechanism that produces the prompt radiation of a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) is still unknown . as a nonthermal process , synchrotron and inverse compton ( ic ) are the main candidates . the former can successfully account for most of the afterglow emission evolution , and is naturally expected from shock - accelerated electrons . as such ,",
    "this has also been considered for explaining the @xmath0-ray prompt emission itself . however , the energy spectrum of a grb , usually modelled with a band function @xcite , is such that the typical value for the low - energy photon index ( @xmath5 ) violates the so - called `` synchrotron death line '' ( @xmath6 ) for a sizable fraction of cases @xcite .",
    "in addition , the value generally observed , @xmath7 , differs from the value of @xmath8 expected for rapidly cooling electrons ( the so - called `` fast - cooling death line '' ; @xcite ) .",
    "although under some assumptions most grb spectra could be reconciled with a synchrotron origin ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the question of whether it is the dominant process in the grb production remains unanswered .",
    "on the other hand , ic has been considered as a possible alternative , such as synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ; @xcite ) , especially when the prompt optical emission is very bright @xcite .",
    "ic as the source of @xmath0-rays requires a soft component in the infrared ( ir ) through ultraviolet ( uv ) range for providing the seed photons ; this in turn means that the second ic component peaks in the gev  tev range , potentially implying an `` energy crisis '' problem @xcite . combining prompt optical and @xmath0-ray measurements , together with the wealth of information derived from the broadband modelling of the early - to - late time afterglow ,",
    "offers a direct way test for ic as the mechanism for the grb production .",
    "the standard afterglow model ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) is rather successful in modelling the temporal and spectral evolution of grb afterglows .",
    "however , models often require modifications , such as energy injections from long - lived internal engines or density enhancements in the surrounding medium , and for a sizable fraction of cases , even these options can not provide a fully satisfactory explanation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "long - duration grbs are also probes of the interstellar and intergalactic medium , and of cosmic star formation history up to redshift @xmath9 @xcite , potentially exploring the reionization epoch @xcite .",
    "spectral energy distribution ( sed ) studies and spectroscopic observations can help to shed light , for instance , on the redshift evolution of dust , gas content , and metallicity of the host galaxies of grbs as well as of the local region within the host ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , they help to identify the crucial physical parameters which favour the production of grbs .",
    "dust - extinction modelling for a sample of grb afterglows with well - sampled seds has shown that most cases can be described with small magellanic cloud ( smc ) profiles @xcite having little evidence for the 2175  bump seen in the milky way extinction curve , except for very few cases @xcite .",
    "no direct link has been found between the properties of the prompt emission and those of the circumburst environment surrounding the grbs and of the host galaxy , such as metallicity @xcite . nevertheless , a detailed picture of the properties that can be derived from the broadband afterglow modelling  the dust content and features along the sightline to the grb within the host galaxy  are crucial to provide a self - consistent description of the entire grb phenomenon , and for unveiling the yet unknown connections between the grb itself and its birthplace and ( to some extent ) progenitor",
    ".    this paper reports comprehensive analysis and discussion of the multi - wavelength dataset collected on the long - duration grb  080603a detected by integral @xcite in light of the current standard fireball model .",
    "this grb provides an ideal test bed because it had an optical flash simultaneous with the prompt emission , and we recorded the broadband afterglow sed and its evolution .",
    "our dataset includes integral data of the @xmath0-ray prompt emission itself , as well as multi - filter photometric and spectroscopic data of the near - infrared / optical afterglow and of the host galaxy .",
    "in addition , we analysed the x - ray afterglow data , discovered in the 0.310  kev band with _",
    "@xcite , from 3  hours to 7  days after the burst .",
    "we also include data from the very large array ( vla ) , taken from 2 to 13 days post burst , in which the radio afterglow was detected .    throughout the paper ,",
    "times are ut and are given relative to the grb onset time as observed with integral , which corresponds to june 3 , 2008 , 11:18:11  ut . the convention @xmath10 is followed , where the energy index @xmath11 is related to the photon index by @xmath12 .",
    "we adopted the standard cosmological model : @xmath13kms@xmath14mpc@xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "all of the quoted errors are given at 90% confidence level for one interesting parameter ( @xmath17 ) , unless stated otherwise .",
    "grb  080603a was detected with the integral / ibis instrument and localised in real time by the integral burst alert system ( ibas ; @xcite ) with an accuracy of @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath0-ray prompt emission in the 20200  kev energy band lasted about 150  s. a quick - look analysis gave a peak flux of 0.5  ph  @xmath19  s@xmath14 , a fluence of about @xmath20  erg  @xmath19 , and burst coordinates @xmath5(j2000 ) @xmath21 , @xmath22(j2000 ) @xmath23 with an error radius of @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the faulkes telescope north ( ftn ) promptly reacted to the ibas alert and began observing at 11:19:51 , which was 100  s after the burst onset time and while prompt @xmath0-ray emission was still ongoing .",
    "the automatic grb pipeline did not identify any candidate ; consequently , a pre - programmed @xmath25 observation sequence with increasingly longer exposure durations was carried out @xcite .",
    "however , visual inspection of the frames revealed the presence of an uncatalogued , variable object at @xmath5(j2000 ) @xmath26 , @xmath22(j2000 ) @xmath27 with @xmath28  mag at @xmath29  min , calibrated against nearby usnob1.0 stars @xcite .",
    "ftn observations continued for 3  hours .",
    "the grb alert system of the katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ; @xcite ) at lick observatory also promptly reacted to the integral alert and independently detected the optical counterpart at a position consistent with that of the ftn , reporting @xmath30  mag at 10.7  min in unfiltered and @xmath31-band images @xcite .",
    "other robotic telescopes also reported the discovery of the afterglow @xcite .",
    "we began spectroscopic observations of the optical afterglow with the gmos dual spectrometer at the gemini - north 8-m telescope starting at time 13:24 , identifying several absorption features at a common redshift of @xmath32 , in agreement with preliminary reports @xcite .",
    "we kept monitoring the evolution of the optical afterglow with the 1.34  m schmidt telescope of the thringer landessternwarte ( tls ) , the liverpool telescope ( lt ) , the keck - i 10-m telescope , the zeiss1000 and azt11 telescopes at the crimean astrophysical observatory ( crao ) , and the azt33ik telescope at sayan observatory up to 4 days post burst @xcite . from 19 to 22  hours",
    "post burst we observed the afterglow at near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths with the peters automated infrared imaging telescope ( pairitel ) through @xmath33 filters @xcite .",
    "our last detection of the optical afterglow was obtained with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; @xcite ) 4 days post burst .",
    "two months after the burst we observed the same field with keck / lris using @xmath34 filters and detected the host galaxy ; these observations were subsequently used to subtract the host contribution when the afterglow became comparably faint .    _",
    "swift_/xrt began observing grb  080603a from 2.9 to 5.9  hours and reobserved it from 2.5 to 7.0  days after the burst .",
    "the x - ray afterglow was clearly identified at position @xmath5(j2000 ) @xmath35 , @xmath22(j2000 ) @xmath36 with an error radius of @xmath37 @xcite . during the same time interval _ swift_/uvot detected the fading afterglow in the @xmath38 band @xcite .",
    "finally , we discovered the radio counterpart with the vla at 4.86 and 8.46  ghz , initially at the latter frequency with a possible detection at 1.9  days at a flux density of @xmath39  @xmath40jy @xcite .",
    "the detection was confirmed at 3.95  days @xcite .",
    "observations continued as late as 13  days post burst .",
    "the galactic reddening along the direction to the grb is @xmath41  mag @xcite .",
    "the galactic extinction in each filter has been estimated through the nasa / ipac extragalactic database extinction calculator .",
    "specifically , the extinction in each filter is derived through the parametrisation by @xcite : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51  mag .",
    "figure  [ f : lc_gamma ] shows the 20200  kev background - subtracted time profile of grb  080603a recorded by the ibis / isgri detector @xcite .",
    "the profile consists of two very similar pulses of duration 30-s , peaking at 14  s and 114  s. a combination of two fast - rise - exponential - decline ( fred)-like pulses as modelled by @xcite gives a satisfactory result ( @xmath52 ) , as shown by the dashed line in figure  [ f : lc_gamma ] .",
    "the parameters used are the peak time @xmath53 , the peak intensity @xmath54 , the rise and decay times @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the pulse width @xmath57 , and the asymmetry @xmath58 .",
    "their best - fitting values are reported in table  [ tab : n05 ] .",
    "apart from the peak of the second pulse , which is roughly twice as intense as that of the first , the two pulses share very similar temporal properties : rise and decay times around 7 and 20  s , respectively , with a corresponding decay - to - rise ratio around a factor of 3 , very typical of classical freds @xcite .",
    "two time - integrated spectra , one for each pulse , show no evidence for spectral evolution : a simple power law can fit both spectra with a @xmath0-ray photon index @xmath59 .",
    "table  [ tab : gamma ] reports the best - fitting spectral parameters .",
    "the 20200  kev total fluence is @xmath60  erg  @xmath19 , in agreement with preliminary reports @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath61 lying between the typical low - energy and high - energy photon indices of grb prompt emission spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) suggests that the peak energy , @xmath62 , is likely to lie within the 20200  kev energy band . in the context of the sample of grbs detected with isgri and bat @xcite , the fluence of grb  080603a makes it a typical burst .    the corresponding flux - density curve shown in figure  [ f : lc_panchro ]",
    "was found to refer to 84  kev ; this is the energy at which the energy spectrum with @xmath63 has the same value as that averaged over the 20200  kev range ."
