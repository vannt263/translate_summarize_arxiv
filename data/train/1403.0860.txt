    "with improved observational sensitivity in both the electromagnetic and gravitational - wave channels , we are approaching the time when we may be able to probe neutron star interiors through asteroseismology .",
    "this era may , in fact , already have begun with observations of quasiperiodic oscillations in the tails of magnetar giant flares ( see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) and the suggestion that the observed oscillations can be mapped to shear modes of the star s crust ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the main lesson learned from this exercise is that the asteroseismology programme is complicated , owing in part to the unknown nature of the state of matter inside the star and the form of the internal magnetic field @xcite . in order to progress further ,",
    "we need theoretical models that account for as much of the involved complex physics as possible ( or , indeed , palatable because the problem becomes increasingly messy ) .",
    "we also need more observational data . in this context , it is interesting to note the recent suggestion by that a non - radial oscillation mode may have been present in the x - ray data associated with the 2002 discovery outburst of xte  j1751@xmath0305 , an accreting neutron star in a low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) with spin frequency @xmath1  hz . the observed frequency @xmath2 is tantalizingly close to the frequency of the star s quadrupole r - mode . in newtonian gravity , this r - mode would have frequency @xmath3 to leading order of a slow - rotation expansion . noting this proximity , discuss whether the observations could be consistent with an r - mode excited in the bulk of the star .",
    "this would be an exciting result , given the suggestion that gravitational - wave emission may drive this particular mode unstable at some critical rotation rate , providing a mechanism to prevent further spin - up by accretion ( @xcite ; see also @xcite , for a recent assessment of this idea ) .    at first sight ,",
    "the r - mode interpretation would seem unlikely , because the observed frequency is close to the mode frequency in a frame co - rotating with the star whereas one might expect a distant observer to see the inertial frame mode frequency , which is @xmath4 to leading order .",
    "the first part of any r - mode interpretation has to deal with this issue .",
    "the required explanation was provided by , who demonstrated that a nonradial oscillation mode can indeed lead to modulations of an x - ray hotspot being observed at the rotating frame mode frequency .",
    "this conclusion is key to the r - mode interpretation of the xte  j1751@xmath0305 data .",
    "however , this is not sufficient to make the connection credible .",
    "strohmayer and mahmoodifar concluded in part that to interpret the observed oscillation frequency as an r - mode , it was necessary for the star s spin rate to be such that it was close to a resonance between a crustal torsional mode and the r - mode frequency .",
    "furthermore , for this to be the case , they noted that the star s crust must have a shear modulus approximately twice as large as is generally predicted ( cf .",
    "the results of @xcite )",
    ". one might not be comfortable with such a sizeable change of a relatively well understood part of the star s physics , but it is a possible explanation .    however , it turns out that one does not need to tweak crust physics to explain the observed frequency in terms of a global r - mode . a large correction to the r - mode frequency",
    "is caused by the combined relativistic effects of the gravitational redshift and rotational frame - dragging .",
    "these effects were calculated some time ago by @xcite . according to their analytic expression for a uniform density barotropic model ( equation  36 of @xcite ) the quadrupole ( @xmath5 ) r",
    "- mode should have a co - rotating r - mode frequency @xmath6 where @xmath7 , \\label{pnfreq}\\ ] ] to first post - newtonian ( 1pn ) order .",
    "this shows that , for a typical neutron star compactness of @xmath8 , the relativistic corrections is at the 10% level .",
    "this is significantly larger than the rotational and crust corrections ( unless one invokes resonances ) considered in @xcite . moreover",
    ", the relativistic effects tend to _ lower _ the ( rotating frame ) mode frequency , exactly as required to explain the observations , which require @xmath9 .",
    "this motivates us to take a closer look at the problem .    in section  [ mass ]",
    "we go beyond the rough estimate of equation ( pnfreq ) and argue that we can use the observational results to constrain the relationship between mass and radius for this neutron star .",
    "if one additionally assumes that the radius lies in the range inferred from radius - expansion burst sources @xcite , estimates for the mass itself are obtained .",
    "we show that this procedure yields a sensible result . however , this is only part of the story  it is also necessary to explain the observed variation in spin frequency for this system . in section [ observations ]",
    "we first consider the issue of spin evolution including only standard accretion torques and magnetic fields , without any r - mode excitation .",
    "we show that the standard models fail to explain the observed frequency variation of xte  j1751@xmath0305 , as different estimates / constraints on the star s magnetic field fail to agree ; we find the same disagreement for another lmxb , igr  j00291 + 5934 . in section [ scenarios ]",
    "we consider the effect of adding an r - mode into the model , with the large amplitude indicated by the strohmayer & mahmoodifar analysis .",
    "we show that , in all plausible scenarios ( i.e. , stable and unstable and unsaturated and saturated ) , the inclusion of the r - mode over the duration of the x - ray outburst ( 10 days or so ) in fact makes the observed spin variation much _ more _ difficult to explain ( strohmayer & mahmoodifar noted this problem while considering only the unstable scenario ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the r - mode interpretation of the data is hard to sustain , but note that future gravitational wave detectors could , if a sufficiently accurate timing model is available , be able to directly test if an r - mode is present at a similar level in any future outburst of xte  j1751@xmath0305 or a similar system .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath10 ( rotating frame ) r - mode frequency to spin frequency is given by @xmath11 only in the highly idealised case of small oscillations of a slowly rotating perfect fluid star , modelled using newtonian gravity .",
    "more realistic models will lead to different @xmath12-values , allowing us to use the observed @xmath13 value to learn something of the physics of the real system . as discussed above",
    ", the effect of general relativity is significant .",
    "the first post - newtonian ( 1pn ) result given in equation ( [ pnfreq ] ) , strictly valid only for a uniform density star ( i.e.  a @xmath14 polytrope ) , leads to an estimate for the compactness @xmath15 .",
    "this can be viewed as a constraint in the mass - radius plane , as represented by the black line in figure [ mrplane ] .",
    "the solid black line includes the effects of general relativity at the first post - newtonian level , but neglects the effects of rapid rotation .",
    "the dashed red line includes the effects of general relativity but again neglects rapid rotation .",
    "the solid red line includes both general relativity and an ( newtonian - based ) estimate of the effects of rapid rotation .",
    "these curves simply give our estimates of the mass as a function of radius  no attempt has been made to bracket uncertainties ; see text for discussion . ]",
    "however , perusal of figure 1 of @xcite , which gives the mode frequency as a function of compactness for a _ fully relativistic _ ( numerical ) calculation , shows a significant _ non - linear _ variation of @xmath12 with compactness , indicating that the 1pn result is _ not _ very accurate for stars with realistic compactness values . using instead the full relativistic result ,",
    "easily read - off from figure 1 of @xcite , we obtain the ( presumably ) more accurate estimate @xmath16 .",
    "this corresponds to the dashed red curve of figure [ mrplane ] .",
    "this constraint is strictly only valid for uniform density stars , but as shown in figure 2 of @xcite , @xmath12 varies by only a few percent when the polytropic index @xmath17 is varied ( at fixed @xmath18 ) over the interval @xmath19 , so it seems the variation of @xmath12 with @xmath18 is much more significant than its variation with the equation of state .",
    "as described in @xcite , there will be rotational corrections to @xmath12 too , of order @xmath20 where the angular frequency is @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the average density of the corresponding non - rotating star of mass @xmath23 and radius @xmath24 .",
    "this indicates that for a star spinning as rapidly as xte  j1751@xmath0305 , rotational corrections are not dominant , but not negligible either . to account for the effect of rotation into our analysis , we write the actual @xmath12 value as the sum of its newtonian part and the relativistic and rotational corrections : @xmath25 the combination @xmath26 , as a function of @xmath18 ,",
    "can be read - off from figure 1 of @xcite .",
    "the rotational corrections are estimated by @xcite , who wrote their result in the form @xmath27 in @xcite it was found that , for stars with @xmath28 and for a variety of realistic equations of state , @xmath29 , so we take @xmath30 as a representative value .",
    "we then have @xmath31 using the observed value @xmath13 , the numerical calculation of @xmath32 of figure 1 of @xcite , and the value @xmath33 , the value of @xmath24 can then be varied over some sensible range , and equation  ( [ eq : kappa_full ] ) is solved numerically for @xmath34 .",
    "the results of such a calculation are depicted by the solid red line in figure [ mrplane ] .",
    "note that our procedure is inconsistent , in that we use the @xmath14 results of @xcite for @xmath32 , but an average over realistic equations of state for a @xmath35 star from the results of @xcite for @xmath36 .",
    "however , as noted above , in both cases the variation in @xmath12 with respect to variations in the equation of state is small , at the level of a few percent , so errors introduced by this inconsistency are presumably at a similar level , much smaller than the variation in @xmath23 when @xmath24 is varied over an astrophysically - plausible interval . given the relatively crude nature of our approximations , a detailed error analysis is clearly not appropriate , but given the several percent variation of @xmath32 of the relativistic correction with polytropic index , and the variation in the rotational parameter @xmath36 over realistic equations of states , the error in this @xmath34 curve due to our lack of knowledge of the real equation of state is plausibly smaller than 10% .    assuming that the inferred compactness reflects the nature of the neutron star , we can combine the result with the radius constraint from x - ray burst sources . according to the most recent analysis by @xcite ,",
    "the allowed radius range for all neutron stars between @xmath37 and @xmath38 is 10.9 to 12.7  km . in other words",
    ", one would expect @xmath39  km , or , more appropriately given our likely level of accuracy , @xmath40  km . combining this result with the inferred compactness ,",
    "we conclude that the mass of the xte  j1751@xmath0305 neutron star should lie in the range @xmath41 , with a preferred value of @xmath42 .",
    "this is a perfectly reasonable mass for a neutron star that has accreted enough mass to be spun up to the observed fast spin .",
    "more detailed calculations , especially concerning the fast rotation correction in general relativity ( perhaps building on @xcite ) are needed to improve on this .",
    "the close proximity ( in frequency ) of a crustal toroidal mode could have a significant effect on the r - mode frequency , and change the above estimates .",
    "however , as strohmayer & mahmoodifar noted , proximity to such an avoided crossing would require an unexpectedly large value for the crustal shear modulus , so this solution does not seem very likely .",
    "there are other pieces of physics , beyond the inclusion of full relativity , rapid rotation , and the crust , that could affect the r - mode frequency .",
    "these include magnetic fields and superfluidity .",
    "the weak magnetic fields of lmxbs indicate that magnetic corrections should be negligible [ see , e.g. @xcite , for normal ( rather than superconducting ) interiors at least ] .",
    "similarly , studies of newtonian stars with superfluid cores indicate that the r - mode we are considering here is relatively insensitive to this aspect @xcite .",
    "having established that the observed frequency would be consistent with a global r - mode oscillation in xte  j1751@xmath0305 , let us now turn to the implications for and constraints from the measured spin evolution of this system .",
    "we will begin by applying ` standard ' accretion theory to this system , which involves only accretion and magnetic fields , deferring the inclusion of r - modes to section [ scenarios ] .",
    "the 2002 x - ray outburst in xte  j1751@xmath0305 occurred from april 3 to april 30 , had a rise time of less than 4  d , peaked around april 45 , and declined exponentially with a decay timescale of @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "pulsations at the spin - frequency of 435  hz were only detectable until april 14 , with the pulse fraction decreasing from 5% to 3% during this early period , and no pulsations were detected afterwards , including during a small outburst that occurred april 2830 ( pulse fraction limit @xmath44 ) .",
    "a reanalysis by @xcite of the outburst found that coherent pulsations could be detected for 9  d ( after which the flux decreased dramatically ) and that a frequency increase ( spin - up ) occurred during this time .",
    "they estimated the spin - up rate to be @xmath45 with an error at the 90% confidence level .",
    "the total change in the spin - frequency was found to be @xmath46 the analysis in @xcite was not able to establish whether there was a dependence of @xmath47 on the mass accretion rate @xmath48 .",
    "we note that the distance to xte  j1751@xmath0305 is estimated to be @xmath49 @xcite , which yields a peak 2 - 10  kev luminosity of @xmath50 for the 2002 outburst @xcite , corresponding to @xmath51 .",
    "xte  j1751@xmath0305 has subsequently exhibited outbursts in 2005 , 2007 , and 2009 .",
    "these outbursts were weaker ( at 14% , 18% , and 27% , respectively , of the 2002 flux ) and shorter ( with decay timescales @xmath52 ) @xcite .",
    "pulsations were only detected in the 2009 outburst for 1  d , with an amplitude of 78% , and there was no significant frequency evolution within this outburst .",
    "the analysis in @xcite suggests a long - term decrease in frequency ( spin - down ) of the pulsations detected in 2002 and those in 2009 , with @xmath53 the picture for xte  j1751@xmath0305 is thus one where the powerful outburst in 2002 was associated with an episode of rapid spin - up , followed by a slow drop off in the spin - rate .",
    "one would expect this behaviour to be naturally explained in terms of a dramatic rise in the accretion torque during the initial outburst and standard magnetic dipole spin - down in between outbursts .",
    "assuming such a scenario will allow us to constrain the stellar magnetic field .    before estimating the torques required to explain the spin - evolution",
    ", we note that the evolution of xte  j1751@xmath0305 is qualitatively similar to that of another accreting pulsar , igr  j00291 + 5934 .",
    "this system underwent outbursts in 2004 and twice in rapid ( 34  d ) succession in 2008 ( and possibly in 1998 and 2001 , as well ) , with each 2008 outburst being about half as luminous as the one in 2004 @xcite .",
    "for the 2004 outburst , the peak bolometric luminosity is @xmath54 , assuming a distance of 5  kpc @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath55 .",
    "the 2004 outburst lasted for 14  d , during which the frequency increased with @xcite @xmath56 the first 2008 outburst had a rise - time of @xmath57 , lasted for 5  d , and decayed with a timescale of @xmath52 , while the second 2008 outburst lasted for 12  d @xcite .",
    "the 598.89  hz pulsations associated with the spin of the neutron star had an amplitude of @xmath58 during both 2008 outbursts but was not detected in between these outbursts ( amplitude @xmath59 ) @xcite .",

    "for example , the simple accretion torque given by @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the alfvn radius and @xmath74 is the dipole moment ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , is shown as the dotted line .",
    "this torque produces a spin - up @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in other words , for a measured @xmath70 and @xmath48 , the neutron star magnetic field is @xmath78 here and in figure  [ obs ] , we use the maximal distance and peak x - ray flux during outburst to determine @xmath48 .",
    "this yields the maximum torque , and the shaded region below the dotted line denotes lower flux .",
    "we see that the spin - up rate and spin - down rate constraints on the magnetic field are wholly inconsistent for igr  j00291 + 5934 , while they are consistent , given the observational uncertainties , for xte  j1751@xmath0305 .",
    "however the simple accretion torque @xmath67 does not fully account for a magnetic field that threads the accretion disc and can lead to spin - up ( when @xmath79 ) or spin - down ( when @xmath80 ) , where @xmath66 @xmath81 $ ] is the fastness parameter and @xmath82 is the kepler rotation frequency at the alfvn radius . a more realistic accretion torque is calculated by @xcite , which is well - approximated by @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "the spin - up regime for this torque is shown as the solid line and cross - hatched region in figure  [ obs ] .",
    "we see that this accretion torque produces a spin - up rate far below the observed @xmath70 for xte  j1751@xmath0305 and igr  j00291 + 5934 .",
    "other accretion torque estimates , such as torque @xmath83 or @xmath84 , where @xmath85 [ @xmath86 is the corotation radius , and models , such as those from @xcite , all fail to produce a strong enough spin - up torque .    finally we can obtain a third estimate of the magnetic field by noting that accretion occurs only when the fastness parameter @xmath87 .",
    "this yields a magnetic field @xmath88 that is , @xmath89 indicated in figure  [ obs ] by where the solid line drops to zero [ since this line denotes @xmath68 ] .",
    "this estimate is close to that obtained from the dipole spin down [ see equation  ( [ eq : bsd ] ) ] , but it does not explain the spin - up rate during outburst [ see equation  ( [ eq : bsu ] ) ] .",
    "the obvious conclusion is that either the accretion torque is severely underestimated or the spin of the star changes due to some other mechanism .",
    "for example , a possible contributing factor is timing noise caused by motion of the x - ray hot spot , such that the measured @xmath47 is not actually a change in the neutron star spin frequency @xcite .",
    "however @xcite and @xcite note that timing noise is weak in the 2002 ( for xte  j1751@xmath0305 ) and 2004 ( for igr  j00291 + 5934 ) outburst data when @xmath70 was measured ( see equations  [ eq : suxte ] and [ eq : suigr ] ) .",
    "therefore it appears unlikely that timing noise could explain the entirety of the significant discrepancy between observed @xmath47 and calculated @xmath47 .",
    "alternatively , it seems reasonable to suggest that the x - ray outburst may be associated with a crust fracture or slight rearrangement of the stellar magnetic field .",
    "this could lead to a shift in the stellar moment of inertia and a glitch similar to those seen in young radio pulsars . noting that the observed @xmath91 , a level typical for smaller glitches , this explanation seems a possibility .",
    "of course , pulse - by - pulse tracking of the signal during outburst could constrain this scenario .",
    "so far we have arrived at two main conclusions .",
    "first of all , the value of the frequency of the observed oscillation in xte  j1751@xmath0305 is consistent with an r - mode , without any particular adjustments to our current understanding of the physics of neutron stars , and does correspond to sensible values for mass and radius .",
    "secondly , we have seen that , when r - modes are not included in the modelling , the observed evolution in the spin frequency ( a spin up ) of the star during the x - ray outburst is not ( completely ) explained by the standard accretion torque .",
    "we will now reconsider the evolution of the spin frequency , with the r - mode included ; there are a variety of possible scenarios depending on the state of the mode : stable versus unstable and unsaturated versus saturated .",
    "it is easy to anticipate that inclusion of the r - mode will make the spin evolution even more difficult to explain , not easier .",
    "note that @xcite briefly described the unstable scenario and its difficulty in explaining the oscillation of xte  j1751@xmath0305 .",
    "the amplitude of the mode is parameterised by @xmath92 ; see @xcite for a definition .",
    "the results of @xcite suggest @xmath93 .",
    "one can immediately say that such a large value for an r - mode amplitude is extremely surprising on the basis of known results .",
    "as is discussed in detail in @xcite , one can place upper limits on r - mode amplitudes of intermittently accreting neutron stars in two ways , providing one assumes the mode is active all the time ( not just during outburst ) .",
    "firstly , one can use the core temperature , inferred from the star s quiescent luminosity , to place a limit on the rate at which an r - mode heats the star , and hence limit the mode s amplitude . secondly ,",
    "if one assumes that the long - term time - averaged change of spin frequency , averaged over many cycles of outburst and quiescence , is zero , with a steady r - mode driven spin - down providing the balance to the ( intermittent ) spin - up from accretion , one again gets an upper limit on @xmath92 .",
    "such estimates typically lead to amplitudes in the range @xmath94 to @xmath95 . using the first of these procedures",
    ", @xcite find @xmath96 for xte  j1751@xmath0305 , much smaller than the value suggested by their measurement from the x - ray lightcurve .",
    "however the oscillation in xte  j1751@xmath0305 was observed only during the 2002 outburst itself .",
    "one can therefore take the conservative approach of setting aside the upper limits quoted above , and consider what effect the presence of an r - mode in this system would have on the spin frequency evolution , _ restricting attention to the interval of the outburst_. two features of the observations are relevant : ( i ) the mode amplitude @xmath92 has a typical value of @xmath97 over the outburst duration , and ( ii ) the star spins up during the outburst , at an average rate given by equation ( [ eq : suxte ] ) above , with a total accumulated spin up given by equation ( [ eq : delta_nu_observed ] ) .",
    "we will show that , even when attention is restricted to these limited observational facts , we fail to find a self - consistent explanation for the spin evolution of the star .",
    "the basic reason for this lies in the well known result that an r - mode of steady amplitude @xmath92 produces a spin - down torque that would tend to make the spin frequency decrease at the rate @xcite : @xmath98 where @xmath99 for a @xmath100 polytrope and @xmath101 is the timescale associated with gravitational radiation reaction effects ; @xmath102 hour for xte  j1751@xmath0305 ( see equation  2.9 of @xcite ; the negative value reflects the fact that gravitational - wave emission tends to destabilize r - modes ) . inserting numerical values , we obtain a spin - down rate of @xmath103 where @xmath104 .",
    "this spindown rate is more than @xmath105 times greater than the observed @xmath106 over the outburst , and of opposite sign ( see equation [ eq : suxte ] ) .",
    "clearly , it is going to be difficult to reconcile the r - mode interpretation with the observed spin evolution .",
    "nevertheless , let us examine the different possible scenarios .",
    "to do so we can use the evolution model of @xcite .",
    "this makes use of the canonical energy of the r - mode : @xmath107 where @xmath108 for a @xmath100 polytrope , and also the total angular momentum of the system ( star + r - mode ) : @xmath109 where @xmath110 ( again for a @xmath100 polytrope ; the constants @xmath111 and @xmath112 are related by @xmath113 ) .",
    "together with expressions for the rate at which energy and angular momentum are radiated , these can be used to give evolution equations for the parameters @xmath114 : @xmath115 @xmath116 \\label{alpeq}\\ ] ] the dimensionless amplitude @xmath92 is expected to saturate due to non - linear effects for an unstable mode , at some value @xmath117 .",
    "the above pair of evolution equations are valid only for @xmath118 . when saturation is achieved , so that @xmath92 takes the constant value @xmath119 , the evolution in spin frequency is given by @xmath120 which is simply equation ( [ eq : steady_spin_down ] ) with @xmath121 .",
    "note that the equations above neglect the ( weak ) spin - up accretion torque .",
    "the current thinking is that this saturation amplitude is small , due to coupling between the r - mode and a sea of other ( shorter length scale ) inertial modes .",
    "the initial estimates for this effect , due to @xcite , lead to a saturation amplitude of order @xmath122 for a star spinning at 435  hz , close to the value inferred from observation .",
    "more recent work predicts a much smaller amplitude , of @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "however , the saturation amplitude depends upon the driving mechanism , and , as we will argue below , it is difficult to reconcile an r - mode interpretation of the observations with the standard unstable r - mode scenario , so it may be that these mode saturation studies are not applicable here .",
    "let us now consider the different possible regimes .",
    "the r - mode may be either stable or unstable .",
    "let us first consider the ( more familiar ) unstable case .",
    "before considering the evolution equations , a first obvious question , given the context provided by the r - mode literature from the last fifteen years or so , has to be if it is conceivable that xte  j1751@xmath0305 lies inside the r - mode instability window .",
    "since this system is not the fastest or hottest among the accreting lmxbs , one would not expect this to be the case ( see , e.g. figure  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , we will explore the consequences of the assumption of instability .",
    "if the mode is saturated , then equation ( [ eq : omega_dot_sat ] ) immediately predicts the rapid spindown described above , inconsistent with the observations .",
    "suppose instead the mode is , at the beginning of the observation at least , not saturated .",
    "then equation ( [ omeq ] ) shows that , for the observed value of @xmath92 , a sufficiently large value of the timescale @xmath124 will give a small spin - down rate due to gravitational wave emission , opening up the possibility of a small net spin - up , once the accretion torque is included .",
    "however , in this case equation ( [ alpeq ] ) indicates that the unstable mode will grow on the short timescale @xmath125 hour , leading to saturation on a timescale much shorter than the observation duration of @xmath126 days .",
    "then the rapid spin - down of equation ( [ eq : omega_dot_sat ] ) again applies , in conflict with the observations .",
    "clearly , there is no consistent scenario in which the mode is unstable : the mode is either saturated throughout the observation , or saturates very quickly , in both cases leading to rapid spin - down , in contradiction with the observed spin - up .",
    "now consider the ( less familiar ) case of stable r - mode evolution .",
    "in fact , the excitation of stable r - modes and their gravitational - wave detectability has already been considered in the context of isolated pulsars @xcite , and an exploration of the corresponding problem in accreting millisecond pulsar systems is currently underway @xcite . in such scenarios , it is necessary to supply some mechanism to excite the mode in the first place , perhaps connected with a glitch in an isolated pulsar or with the process that initiates bursts in accreting systems .",
    "we will therefore suppose some process suddenly excites the mode on some short dynamical timescale , up to an amplitude @xmath93 .",
    "if this happens at fixed angular momentum , equation ( [ jtot ] ) implies a corresponding _ spin - up _ of the star : @xmath127 this is larger than the total spin - up measured over the course of the outburst , as given in equation ( [ eq : delta_nu_observed ] ) .",
    "however , once excited , equation ( [ alpeq ] ) shows that the only way the mode can remain at ( or close to ) this level for the long duration of the observation @xmath128 is if there is a near - cancellation between the @xmath101 and @xmath124 terms , so that @xmath129 . in such a case ,",
    "equation  ( [ omeq ] ) again gives rapid spin - down and total spin - down over the course of the observation @xmath130 comparing equations ( [ eq : kick_spin_up ] ) and ( [ eq : delta_omega_spin_down ] ) , we see that spin - down due to the gravitational - wave emission exceeds the initial spin - up due to the kick by a factor @xmath131 , so that the strong gravitational - wave torque clearly results in a net spin - down over the course of the observation , in conflict with the observations .",
    "one might attempt to evade this conclusion by , instead of exciting the mode once with an impulsive kick , having some excitation mechanism acting in a continuous manner .",
    "if one adds energy to @xmath132 at a rate @xmath133 , then it is straight - forward to show that the evolution equations become @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "\\label{alpeq_x}\\ ] ] there is no difficulty in choosing a value of @xmath133 such that , in equation ( [ alpeq_x ] ) , @xmath136 can be made zero ( or very small ) such that the mode amplitude remains constant ( or nearly constant ) over the observation period at @xmath93 .",
    "however , eliminating @xmath133 from ( [ alpeq_x ] ) using ( [ omeq_x ] ) leads to @xmath137.\\ ] ] by assumption , a nearly constant mode amplitude over the observation period means that @xmath138 ( this follows from @xmath139 and @xmath140 ) .",
    "then this equation reduces to the familiar strong spin - down of equation ( [ eq : steady_spin_down ] ) above , again in conflict with the observations .",
    "the unavoidable conclusion is that , within the standard phenomenological model for r - modes ( be they unstable or stable ) , it is _ not _ possible to reconcile the presence of a mode excited to the suggested amplitude with the observed spin evolution of the system .",
    "we showed that the observed frequency of the oscillation seen in xte  j1751@xmath0305 during the 2002 outburst , if interpreted as an r - mode , would correspond to sensible values of mass and radius for the neutron star .",
    "however , we also argued that the presence of an r - mode with the large amplitude that the observations suggest , can not be reconciled with the observed spin - up observed over the duration of the outburst .",
    "we conclude that the presence of an r - mode in xte  j1751@xmath0305 during the 2002 outburst is not consistent with our current understanding of neutron star dynamics and must therefore be considered unlikely .",
    "nevertheless , one can look to gravitational - wave observations to see if they might be able to rule out ( or indeed support ) the r - mode scenario for similar events in the future . for the purpose of such a search in the case of xte  j1751@xmath0305",
    ", it is interesting to note that the frequency of the signal would be known . the observed electromagnetic signal would carry the rotating frame frequency , but a gravitational - wave counterpart would be found at the inertial frame frequency .",
    "this means that one ought to search at @xmath141 moreover , it is easy to make a back - of - the - envelope estimate of the effective gravitational amplitude . the associated strain can be obtained from @xmath142 where we take a conservative distance to the source of @xmath143  kpc and @xmath144 @xcite . inserting a mode amplitude of @xmath93 , this leads to ( for the preferred values of mass and radius from section  [ mass ] ) @xmath145 assuming that the mode remains at this amplitude over the outburst , this would be a periodic signal , the detectability of which increases with the observation time .",
    "the effective amplitude is then @xmath146    the outburst in xte  j1751@xmath0305 in fact preceded the first ligo science run ( s1 ) by a matter of a few months , so there is no possibility of carrying out a gravitational - wave search on archival ligo science data . however , we note that this would have corresponded to a signal - to - noise of about @xmath147 if present in ligo s5 data , and about @xmath148 in advanced ligo data , _ assuming that one can perform a fully phase coherent search over the observation period_. @xcite did indeed find that the observed oscillation was highly coherent , quoting the oscillation frequency ( in hertz ) to the sixth decimal place , i.e. at the resolution of the fourier transform @xmath149(@xmath150 days ) .",
    "see also their figure 4 . clearly ,",
    "the oscillation itself was intrinsically stable , and also the orbital solution was known sufficiently accurately to allow the effects of doppler modulation due to the orbit to be largely removed over the observation interval .",
    "should such an accurate timing solution be available for any future outburst , a fully coherent gravitational wave search could be carried out .",
    "alternatively , in the absence of such an accurate timing solution , a search over a parameter space that allows for the orbital uncertainties could be carried out , but this would increase the signal - to - noise required to claim detection , as discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "clearly , the signal analysis procedures for carrying out such a search merit further investigation and could be put to use if this ( or a similar accreting system ) were to display similar behaviour during a future science run of an advanced gravitational - wave detector .",
