    "the kondo lattice model ( klm ) is used to describe compounds containing localized magnetic moments , such as heavy fermion systems and kondo insulators .",
    "@xcite the klm hamiltonian is given by : @xmath3here , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are itinerant and local ( @xmath6- ) spins on site @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the klm takes into account hopping of conduction electrons , @xmath8 , and their kondo interaction , @xmath0 , with local @xmath6-spins .",
    "the kondo term causes a screening of local spins , but also induces indirect rkky interactions between the local spins on the lattice .",
    "these two interactions compete , leading to either magnetically ordered or non - magnetic ground states , separated by the quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "@xcite the nature of the qcp in heavy fermion compounds is one of the central topics of condensed matter physics today .",
    "@xcite    various analytical and numerical methods have been used to study the klm , like the mean - field approach  @xcite and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method .",
    "@xcite the finite temperature lanczos method ( ftlm )  @xcite has been used to study thermodynamic functions .",
    "@xcite also the periodic anderson model on finite size clusters has been studied with similar methods recently .",
    "@xcite    here , we use the ftlm and mainly focus the analysis on the temperature dependence and the ground state values of static correlation functions , of central importance for the qcp .",
    "we compare onsite vs. intersite correlations on the lattice and also compare the former with the impurity case .",
    "the latter is associated with rkky interactions .",
    "we also investigate the evolution of the total onsite moment with kondo coupling strength @xmath0 .",
    "the main advantage of the ftlm is that it involves no uncontrolled approximations and is exact for finite size clusters .",
    "it treats both , kondo screening and rkky interactions , correctly .",
    "we consider the 8-site cluster of a square lattice , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ dos ] , with periodic ( pbc ) and open ( obc ) boundary conditions at half filling .",
    "we will show that for this cluster the two different boundary conditions lead to two interesting physical situations , which may have relevance to the two types of qcp s observed ( cf . ref .   and references cited therein ) .",
    "there is of course only one solution of the klm in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , the real materials have more complex band structures than described by the n.  n. hopping in  ( [ klh ] ) . by varying boundary conditions for the klm on the small cluster one may mimic band structures with different characteristic behaviour of the density of states ( dos ) around the fermi level .",
    "for this reason we present in detail the analysis of the klm on the finite cluster for the pbc and the obc and compare the two cases . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the specific heat anomalies obtained in the two cases .",
    "iii discusses the central problem of kondo - lattice physics : the competition and crossover behaviour of onsite and intersite correlations as function of temperature and control parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the associated kondo screening behaviour evident from the susceptibility and total local moment is presented in sec .",
    "finally sec .",
    "v summarizes the results in a phase diagram and gives the conclusions .",
    "the specific heat for the pbc and the obc , for various coupling constants @xmath0 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ cv ] .",
    "the low - temperature specific heat for non - interacting case , @xmath9 , with pbc deviates significantly from the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the reason is that 6 out of 8 electrons are placed on the `` fermi surface '' , shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ dos ] , thus the ground state is highly degenerate .",
    "the specific heat for obc is closer to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the peak from the hopping term for @xmath10 is much more pronounced and at lower temperature , @xmath11 , for obc than for pbc .",
    "the electronic states for obc are no longer bloch states , but the important point is that the electron energies are shifted from , and distributed below , the `` fermi level '' .",
    "the distribution of these discrete levels is such that it relatively well mimics the continuum dos in the thermodynamic limit , as shown in fig .",
    "[ dos ] .",
    "the specific heat for pbc and obc , when kondo interaction is turned on , shows qualitatively different behavior in the weak coupling regime , @xmath12 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cv ] . for pbc , a double peak structure is observed at low temperatures for @xmath13 .",
    "we may denote the positions of the upper and lower peak by @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "for obc only one low temperature peak appears at @xmath16 .",
    "the origin of these peaks are spin degrees of freedom , whose degeneracy is lifted by kondo interaction . in the strong coupling limit there is only one peak in the specific heat , and it does not depend on the boundary conditions",
    ".    the specific heat for obc agrees with the results obtained with the same method for the 10-site cluster with pbc in ref .  , as well as with the results obtained with the qmc in ref .  .",
    "the nature of the specific heat peaks may be revealed by considering appropriate static correlation functions .",
    "we focus the analysis on the following two : @xmath17 is the onsite correlation function between local and itinerant spins , while @xmath18 is the intersite correlation function between local spins on neighboring sites for pbc . for obc these",
    "are @xmath19 and @xmath20 , i.e. , the inner sites 3 and 6 are considered , because they are more representative than sites on the edges of the cluster ( cf .",
    "[ dos ] ) .",
    "the onsite correlations , @xmath17 , for pbc as function of temperature are shown in fig .",
    "[ corrt ] .",
    "they are also compared with the onsite correlations for the impurity case , where there is only one local spin , at site 1 , on the 8-site cluster . in the weak coupling regime",
    "the onsite screening is decreased in the lattice , because there are less itinerant spins per local spin available for the screening .",
    "the inflection points of the correlation functions , as function of temperature , indicate that the upper peak in the specific heat , at @xmath14 , corresponds to the formation of the onsite correlations , whereas the lower one , at @xmath15 , corresponds to the formation of the intersite correlations .",
    "the ground state ( @xmath21  k ) correlations for pbc as function of coupling strength @xmath1 are shown in the inset of fig .  [ corrpbc ] .",
    "it is seen that the onsite correlations are stronger than the intersite correlations for all @xmath1 .",
    "another characteristic is that @xmath17 jumps to the large absolute value as soon as @xmath0 is turned on .",
    "this is a consequence of the degenerate itinerant degrees of freedom at fermi level for @xmath10 .",
    "the free itinerant spins on the `` fermi level '' screen the local spins onsite as soon as @xmath22 ; the ground state splits off and is characterized by finite @xmath17 correlations .",
    "the unscreened parts of the local spins form intersite correlations , @xmath18 , below @xmath15 , due to the rkky interaction .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath18 increases rapidly as @xmath0 is turned on .",
    "because of the very small energy scale ( quadratic in @xmath0 ) , convergence problems appear in the calculation of ground state @xmath18 correlations for @xmath23 and we were not able to determine whether they also jump for finite @xmath0 . in the strong coupling regime the intersite correlations vanish , while the onsite correlations saturate at @xmath24 , as the onsite singlets are formed .",
    "the correlation functions , normalized to the ground state values , versus scaled temperature , as done in ref .  , are shown in fig .",
    "[ corrpbc ] .",
    "the onsite correlations are characterized by a single temperature scale , perfectly linear in @xmath1 .",
    "the intersite correlations are also characterized by a single temperature scale proportional to @xmath0@xmath25 .",
    "this shows that for pbc the onsite screening is independent of the intersite correlations , which may be associated with rkky interactions .",
    "this is a consequence of the special symmetry of the 8-site cluster which implies a large fraction of conduction electron sitting on the `` fermi surface '' .",
    "nevertheless it is an interesting result which may have relevance for a case where the conduction electron dos is strongly peaked at the fermi level .      the onsite correlations , @xmath19 , for obc as function of temperature and the comparison to the impurity case are also shown in fig .",
    "[ corrt ] .",
    "in contrast to the pbc , for obc the onsite correlations are enhanced in the lattice . in the case of obc",
    "there are no `` free '' itinerant spins , i.e. , conduction electrons on the `` fermi level '' . in the weak coupling limit the onsite",
    "screening is not a direct process and is weak .",
    "the interesting point is the appearance of a new low energy scale in the lattice , which may be noted as a low - temperature downturn in the onsite correlations in fig .",
    "[ corrt ] .",
    "the ground state correlations are shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ corrobc ] .",
    "the onsite correlations , @xmath19 , do not jump as @xmath0 is turned on , but rather increase continuously with @xmath0 .",
    "the intersite correlations , @xmath20 , are much stronger than @xmath18 for pbc and in the weak coupling limit they are even larger in absolute values than the onsite @xmath19 correlations .",
    "it is understandable , because the local spins are only weakly screened , due to the lack of `` free '' itinerant spins .",
    "therefore , the unscreened local spins can form strong intersite correlations .",
    "the normalized correlations as function of the scaled temperature for obc are shown in fig .",
    "[ corrobc ] . the @xmath19 scale with @xmath0 only in the strong coupling limit . in the weak coupling limit",
    "two characteristic temperatures or energy scales can be identified , as already mentioned above .",
    "the upper one is associated with the energy splitting of the discrete energy levels ( cf .",
    "[ dos ] ) , and is clearly a finite size effect .",
    "the lower energy scale is associated with the additional onsite screening , due to the presence of other local spins in the lattice .",
    "the intersite @xmath20 correlations are still approximately governed by a single energy scale , @xmath26 , just as for pbc .",
    "indeed the behavior of the normalized intersite correlation functions for obc and pbc are quite similar , despite of the fact that the magnitude differs by a factor of two .",
    "the spin correlations are also directly reflected in magnetic susceptibility , shown in fig .",
    "[ chi ] , for pbc and obc .",
    "it is multiplied by @xmath0 and plotted versus temperature scaled with @xmath0 , as was done in ref .  .",
    "the two peaks for pbc are clearly seen for small @xmath1 , as in the specific heat .",
    "however , in the magnetic susceptibility even the lower peak for @xmath1@xmath27 is clearly seen .",
    "this is because the lower peaks in the magnetic susceptibility are much more pronounced and at slightly higher temperatures than the corresponding peaks in the specific heat .",
    "the position of the lower peak scales well with @xmath28 ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "the lower peak is not distinguishable any more for @xmath29 .",
    "the position of the higher peak scales with @xmath0 . for obc only one large peak is seen .",
    "for @xmath12 it scales approximately with @xmath28 . in the strong coupling limit , @xmath29 ,",
    "the peak scales linearly with @xmath0 , just as for pbc .",
    "the results for obc are similar to the results for the 10-site cluster with pbc in ref .  .",
    "these results are also similar to the results of the qmc calculations for larger clusters in ref .  .",
    "however , in ref .",
    ", the magnetic susceptibility peak scales with @xmath0@xmath30 , while in the onsite correlations the characteristic temperature is proportional to @xmath0 , suggesting the existence of two low energy scales .    in the insets of fig .",
    "[ chi ] the ground state values of the total local moments are shown , defined as : @xmath31 the interesting quantity here is @xmath32 which is a measure of itinerant spin localization . in the strong coupling limit @xmath33 ,",
    "i.e. , the itinerant spins become localized as the onsite singlets are formed and the hopping of conduction electrons is frozen .",
    "when the conduction electrons are completely delocalized , i.e. , for @xmath0@xmath34 , @xmath35 , because the probability of finding one electron with spin up or down on one particular site is @xmath36 . accordingly , @xmath37 for @xmath9 while for @xmath38 it vanishes , as the onsite singlets are formed and the local moments completely screened .",
    "there is a jump for @xmath1@xmath39 for pbc .",
    "it has the same origin as the jump for the onsite correlations @xmath17 , i.e. , the highly degenerate unperturbed conduction electron ground state .",
    "a jump is also present in @xmath32 . for obc",
    "we see a continuous decrease of @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath40 is a good quantity to define a critical value of @xmath1 at which the crossover from predominantly magnetic to predominantly nonmagnetic ground state occurs .",
    "the other possibility would be to compare directly the intersite and onsite correlations , but the intersite correlations depend strongly on the cluster size .",
    "therefore we define a critical ( @xmath1)@xmath41 as the value for which @xmath42 . then for obc , ( @xmath1)@xmath43 ( cf .",
    "[ chi ] ) , in good agreement with the values obtained from the quantum monte carlo  @xcite and the mean - field analysis .",
    "@xcite for pbc it would be @xmath44 , but for this small cluster size , obc are much more representative for the thermodynamic limit of the klm .",
    "we may summarize the results in form of phase diagrams for pbc and obc , shown in fig .",
    "[ phdia ] . in the phase",
    "diagrams the positions of specific heat maxima are plotted as function of coupling strength , @xmath1 .",
    "also the inflection points of the correlation functions are plotted , and they mostly follow the positions of the corresponding specific heat maxima .    in the weak coupling regime , for pbc , two characteristic temperatures , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , are found .",
    "the @xmath15 can not be determined for @xmath1@xmath45 , but we make the continuation with the @xmath18 inflection point temperature , @xmath46 , which can be defined for all coupling strengths . therefore we conclude that the corresponding anomaly in the specific heat is still there , but is too small to be identified .",
    "the inflection points of the correlation functions reveal that the characteristic temperatures @xmath14 and @xmath15 correspond to the energy scales of onsite correlations and intersite correlations , respectively .",
    "the former is linear in @xmath0 for all @xmath1 .",
    "the latter is proportional to @xmath26 , and may be associated with the rkky interaction .    for obc",
    ", there is only one characteristic temperature , @xmath16 , for all @xmath1 . in the weak coupling regime , for @xmath1@xmath47 , below @xmath16 predominantly intersite correlations are formed .",
    "however , @xmath16 is also the characteristic temperature of onsite correlations .",
    "this is seen from the positions of inflection points for the corresponding correlations , also shown in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ phdia ] .",
    "because the intersite correlations dominate and the characteristic temperature is approximately quadratic in @xmath0 , the corresponding energy scale , in the weak coupling regime , may be associated with the rkky interaction .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath48 , i.e. , the rkky interaction is not very sensitive to the distribution of non - interacting conduction electron states .",
    "this is plausible with the known expression for the rkky characteristic temperature , @xmath49 ( e.g.  @xcite ) , where @xmath50 is the band width .",
    "it is also important that the rkky energy scale is the energy scale of the onsite correlations in the weak coupling regime for the obc .",
    "we may generally conclude that the rkky energy scale is the lowest energy scale of the klm ; if the local spins are not screened above @xmath51 , then it is the only energy scale of the system .",
    "in contrast , the onsite correlations , i.e. , the onsite screening of local spins , is very sensitive to the number of states within @xmath0 around the `` fermi level '' , as seen from the difference between @xmath14 and @xmath16 for pbc and obc , respectively .",
    "this is plausible with the expression for the single impurity kondo temperature , which depends exponentially on the dos at the fermi level , @xmath52 ; @xmath53}$ ] .    in the strong coupling regime",
    ", only one characteristic temperature is found for both pbc and obc .",
    "it corresponds to the energy of the onsite singlet formation , which is linear in @xmath0 .",
    "boundary conditions are unimportant , because the local physics determines the properties of the system",
    ".    we may argue on the relevance of these results for the system in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "recently a qcp was found @xcite whose properties deviate from the expected behavior ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the properties of the system at the qcp are determined by the competition between the onsite screening and the rkky interaction .",
    "here we have shown that the competition between the onsite screening and the rkky interaction strongly depends on the particular form of the distribution of non - interecting conduction electron levels .",
    "we may anticipate that in the thermodynamic limit this means a strong dependence on the particular form of non - interacting conduction electron dos . a strongly peaked dos near the fermi level favors onsite screening , while the rkky interaction is not very sensitive to the particular shape of the dos .",
    "these results indicate that the shape of the dos is very important for the properties of the heavy fermion systems in the vicinity of the qcp .",
    "finally , the qualitative behavior of the correlation functions for the klm with obc is similar to the klm without charge degrees of freedom ,  @xcite which is a generalized kondo necklace model in 2d from doniach s original work .",
    "@xcite this shows that this simplified model describes well the spin degrees of freedom in the klm at half - filling ."
