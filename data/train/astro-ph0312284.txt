    "if a well - motivated form for the deviations exists , the constraints can be improved by incorporating the specific form in the analysis .",

    "the presence of a high - energy cutoff in the description of fluctuations during inflation naturally leads to an oscilatory modification  @xcite .",
    "current data sets allow a very loose limit on a restricted , two - parameter form of the oscillation  @xcite , and an oscillation may be favored  @xcite , although no constraints have been derived on the parameters that define the oscillations .",

    "the transfer functions @xmath107 also include contributions that arise due to secondary effects .",
    "in the low multipole regime , the temperature transfer function includes a contribution from the integrated sachs - wolfe effect  @xcite , which provides additional power at lower multipoles .",
    "rescattering of the cmb photons during reionization contributes to a feature in the low multipole regime of the polarization transfer function .",

    "lensing has the effect of redistributing power between adjacent multipole bins , thereby reducing the width of resolvable features to roughly @xmath110 .",

    "we will restrict the range of @xmath79 to be below 30 in our analysis to avoid the regime where contamination due to lensing is an important effect .",
    "we are interested in how well the microwave background can in principle distinguish signatures of new physics from the standard inflationary models .",

    "furthermore , the analyses of the ideal case depend on the choice of fiducial models .",
    "we currently have no _ a priori _ knowledge , either from experiments or theoretical prejudice , about what set of parameters would constitute a reasonable fiducial model other than the standard inflationary model without oscillations .",

    "given that the oscillation for @xmath176 is given by @xmath177 , \\label{eqn : argument}\\ ] ] shifting @xmath79 by @xmath178 for some integer @xmath179 does not change the value of the cosine at wave number @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath180 is a slowly varying function of @xmath15 , so that the value of the cosine is roughly constant for @xmath173 in integer multiples of @xmath181",
    ". if we now make a simplifying assumption that the likelihood is dominated by contributions from a small range in @xmath36 around some value @xmath182 , then the likelihood function should exhibit this multiplicity as structures along @xmath183    the low likelihood in the range @xmath184 can be explained by noting the frequency of oscillatory peaks and troughs in each decade . in each decade , there are approximately @xmath185 oscillations , so that in the range @xmath184 , this corresponds to roughly three extrema in the oscillatory features ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : threeosc ] ) .",
    "the extrema in the oscillations tend to coincide with the cmb acoustic peaks , and the overall effect of the primordial oscillations is to change the heights of the acoustic peaks .",
    "as is well known , the ratio of heights of the cmb acoustic peaks can be constrained tightly , and as a result , the likelihoods for @xmath184 tend to be lower . because our mcmc sampler moves the chain based on the ratio of likelihoods , the lack of high likelihood regions between @xmath174 and @xmath175 implies that the chains do not tend to cross into this region , possibly explaining the fact that our chains do not explore the region below @xmath175 .",
    "given the presence of such irregularities , obtaining reliable constraints on the oscillation parameters is difficult .",
    "we believe that our reparametrization of the oscillation parameters into physically distinct parameters reduces the irregularities in the amplitude parameter , making the results concerning @xmath77 robust . however , to obtain robust limits on the other parameters , the presence of multiple maxima needs to be taken into account .    in mcmc analysis , the step sizes are typically taken to be similar to the characteristic size of the ( hopefully global ) maximum of the likelihood .",
    "however , if the local maxima have similar sizes , the chains can get stuck in the local maxima for a long time and lead to false conclusions about the location and constraints from the chains . in exploring these models ,",
    "it is therefore important to monitor convergence using multiple chains , since it is unlikely that chains started from different , randomly chosen starting points would all fall into the same false local maximum .",
    "furthermore , nonstandard algorithms ( e.g. , high - temperature chains  @xcite and other modified samplers  @xcite ) might be necessary to improve mixing of the chains , allowing exploration of the irregular features in a reasonable amount of computation time .",
    "we have performed a full likelihood analysis of the detectability of oscillatory primordial power spectra in current and future cmb data , motivated by a phenomenological description of possible effects on the primordial power spectrum due to the presence of a high - energy cutoff  @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , only a weak constraint can be placed on the parameters that define the oscillations , the current data set being consistent with a scale - invariant power spectrum without oscillations .",
    "the analysis of the fundamental limitation from a cosmic variance limited experiment gives us cause for some cautious optimism , suggesting that the amplitude of the oscillations can be limited to less than @xmath171 . under the assumption that the vacuum choice parameter @xmath186 , this translates to a possible limit on the cutoff energy scale of @xmath187 .",
    "stated differently , if @xmath188 , the resulting features in the primordial power spectrum is observable in principle , allowing such a model to be distinguished from the null model .",
    "note that this is currently the only limit on the cutoff scale using the effects on the vacuum choice . as noted above",
    ", however , the limits on the other parameters may not be robust due to the fact that the likelihood function exhibits multiple local maxima .",
    "future analyses may need to take this into account by utilizing mcmc techniques that facilitate jumps between maxima , such as modifications to the sampling method .",
    "is it possible to do better ? at present ,",
    "the cmb remains the best tool for exploring the shape of the primordial power spectrum , limited fundamentally by gravitational lensing due to the intervening matter  @xcite .",
    "other probes of cosmological fluctuations , such as weak lensing surveys , can help extend the wave number range that can be probed , but exploring the effect of uncertainties from such surveys is beyond the scope of this work .    given the complex structure of the likelihood function , robust results from high - precision surveys will require the use of modified mcmc algorithms in order to map out the multiple features in the likelihood . with that caveat , future surveys , such as the planck and cmbpol missions , should be able to limit the shape of the primordial power spectrum and provide an insight into the nature of the high energy cutoff .",
