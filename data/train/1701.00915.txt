    "the existing contemporary communications systems can be abstractly characterized by the conceptual seven - layer open systems interconnection model .",
    "the lowest ( or first ) layer , known as the _ physical layer _ , aims to describe the communication process over an actual physical medium .",
    "due to the increasing demand for flexibility , information exchange nowadays often occurs via antennas at the transmitting and receiving end of a wireless medium , _",
    "e.g. _ , using mobile phones or tablets for data transmission and reception .",
    "an electromagnetic signal transmitted over a wireless channel is prone to interference , fading , and environmental effects caused by , _",
    "e.g. _ , surrounding buildings , trees , and vehicles , making reliable wireless communications a challenging technological problem .    with the advances in communications engineering , it was soon noticed that increasing the number of spatially separated antennas at both ends of a wireless channel , as well as adding redundancy by repeatedly transmitting the same information encoded over multiple time instances , can dramatically improve the transmission quality .",
    "a code representing both diversity over time and space is thus called a _ space ",
    "time code_. let us assume @xmath0 and @xmath1 antennas at the transmitting and receiving end of the channel respectively , as well as @xmath2 consecutive time instances for transmission .",
    "if @xmath3 , the channel is called _ symmetric _ , and otherwise asymmetric , which more precisely typically refers to the case @xmath4 . for the time being , a space  time code @xmath5 will just be a finite collection of complex matrices in @xmath6 .",
    "the well known channel equation in this multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) setting takes the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the received and transmitted codeword matrices , respectively . in the above equation ,",
    "fading is usually modeled as a rayleigh distributed random process and represented by the random complex _",
    "channel matrix _ @xmath10 , and additive noise is modeled by the _ noise matrix _ @xmath11 , whose entries are independent , identically distributed complex gaussian random variables with zero mean .",
    "the main object in is the _ space  time code matrix _",
    "@xmath12 , a complex matrix which captures the data to be transmitted across multiple antennas .",
    "namely , the complex number @xmath13 is transmitted from the @xmath14 antenna in the @xmath15 channel use .",
    "let us briefly discuss what constitutes a `` good '' code . consider a space  time code @xmath5 , and let @xmath16 be code matrices ranging over @xmath5 .",
    "two basic design criteria can be derived in order to minimize the probability of error @xcite .    * _ diversity gain criterion : _ to be able to distinguish between two different codewords , we should first maximize the minimum rank of the difference of pairwise distinct matrices @xmath17 .",

    "for more information see @xcite . `",
    "asymptotically ' above means that we assume @xmath23 is relatively large , that is , the signal is of good quality .",
    "this is a standard assumption in code design . ] .",
    "thus , @xmath24 should be as big as possible .    if we let the size of the code grow , @xmath25 , and still have @xmath26 , the space ",
    "time code is said to have the _ nonvanishing determinant _ property @xcite .",
    "in other words , a nonvanishing determinant guarantees that the minimum determinant is bounded from below by a positive constant even in the limit , and hence the error probability will not blow up when increasing the code size .",
    "consequently , a good space  time code should ideally be composed of full - rank matrices with large , nonvanishing minimum determinants .",
    "`` large '' here is a relative notion and to make it sensible we need some kind of a normalization .",
    "we will come back to this in section [ sec : sec2 ] .    in 2003 ,",
    "the usefulness of central simple algebras to construct space ",
    "time codes meeting both of the above criteria was established in @xcite ; especially ( cyclic ) division algebras , for which the property of being division immediately implies full diversity .",
    "thereupon the construction of space  time codes started to rely on cleverly designed algebraic structures .",
    "the initially considered cyclic division algebras were however constructed using transcendental elements , which in turn resulted in codes with vanishing minimum determinants .",
    "later on , it was shown in @xcite that in a cyclic division algebra based code , the nonvanishing determinant property is enough to achieve the optimal trade - off between diversity and multiplexing ; it was also proved that achieving the nonvanishing determinant property of a cyclic - division - algebra - based code can be ensured by restricting the entries of the codewords to certain subrings of the algebra alongside with a smart choice for the base field .",
    "further investigation carried out in @xcite showed that codes constructed from orders , in particular _",
    "maximal orders _ , of cyclic division algebras actually outperform codes that had been considered unbeatable .",
    "the improvement in performance , however , came with the price of somewhat higher complexity in encoding and decoding , as well as more problematic bit labeling of the codewords .    as is well known , a maximal order of a cyclic division algebra is not necessarily unique . as a consequence , carrying out the explicit computations required for the purpose of space ",
    "time coding is a very challenging task .",
    "for this reason , and as a compromise for reducing the complexity of communication while still guaranteeing good performance , the use of _ natural orders _  the main objects of our work  is often preferred instead .",
    "however , the current explicit constructions are typically limited to the symmetric case , while the asymmetric case remains largely open . the main goal of this paper is to fill this gap in the construction of explicit optimal ( with certain given assumptions , in our case the order being natural ) asymmetric space  time codes .",
    "in section 2 we will shortly introduce mimo space ",
    "time coding and the construction of space  time codes using representations of orders in central simple algebras .",
    "section 3 contains the main results of this article .",
    "we will consider the most interesting asymmetric mimo channel setups and fix @xmath27 or @xmath28 as the base field to guarantee the nonvanishing determinant property matches with the quadrature amplitude modulation ( qam ) commonly used in engineering . ] .",
    "for each such setup @xmath29 , we will find an explicit field extension @xmath30 and an explicit @xmath31-central cyclic division algebra with coefficients in @xmath32 , such that the norm of the discriminant of its natural order is minimal .",
    "this will translate into the largest possible determinant ( see @xcite for the proof ) and thus provide us with the maximal coding gain one can achieve by using a natural order .",
    "from now on , and for the sake of simplicity , we set the number @xmath0 of transmitting antennas equal to the number @xmath2 of time slots used for transmission .",
    "thus , the considered codewords will be square matrices .",
    "very simplistically defined , a space  time code is a finite set of complex matrices .",
    "however , in order to avoid accumulation points at the receiver , in practical implementations it is convenient to impose an additional discrete structure on the code , such as a lattice structure .",

    "consequently , in order to be able to compare different lattices for the purpose of space ",
    "time coding , we will need some kind of a normalization . to this end , let @xmath40 form a basis of a full lattice @xmath33 with volume @xmath41 , and consider its gram matrix @xmath42_{1 \\le i , j \\le 2n^2}.\\ ] ] we have @xmath43 .",
