    "as the half - lives of nuclei close to the neutron drip line are very short , no target material can be fabricated .",
    "therefore , these nuclei have to be studied in beam , e.g. by exploiting the virtual gamma field of a lead target .",
    "the astrophysically important neutron capture reaction may , then , be studied by time inversion applying the principle of detailed balance @xcite .    in the s393 experiment at the land / r3b setup ( large area neutron detector ; reactions with relativistic radioactive beams ) at gsi darmstadt , germany , many neutron - rich nuclei were provided in a cocktail beam . in this article , experimental results on the coulomb dissociation cross sections of @xmath4n and @xmath5n are discussed .",

    "the secondary ions are separated with respect to their velocity according to their mass - to - charge ratio .    at the end of the frs",
    "the secondary ions traverse a 3 mm thick plastic scintillator ( called s8 ) at a distance of 55 m from the reaction target ( mentioned later in detail ) .",
    "additionally , the pos detector , a 1 mm thick plastic scintillator at the entrance of the land / r3b cave , is placed 1.45 m in front of the reaction target .",
    "together , these detectors are used for time - of - flight measurements to identify the mass - to - charge ratio @xmath9 of the secondary ions .    besides that , a psp detector ( position - sensitive silicon pin diode ) , placed 105 cm upstream of the reaction target , is used to determine the charge of the secondary ions by an energy loss measurement @xmath10 , which completes the identification of the particles impinging onto the land / r3b setup . after a rough selection of the ion of interest ,",

    "we fix the charge number @xmath20 of the outgoing heavy reaction fragment for the specific reaction channel ( @xmath20 = 7 ) by a cut on the energy loss in the tfw .",
    "then the deflection of the fragments in the magnetic field depends only on their mass number @xmath21 and their velocity .",
    "in addition , the horizontal position measurement at the gfis , used to identify the mass number of the fragment , is additionally correlated with the angle of emission and the interaction position at the target . in order to convert the horizontal position measurements of the charged fragments at the gfis into mass numbers , a mass reconstruction algorithm using the trajectories and time - of - flight information is used .    a valid reaction event is defined for further analysis when each of the following conditions are fulfilled .",
    "exactly one neutron is registered in land .",
    "late neutron events , i.e. from scattered neutrons , are rejected by a cut on the neutron velocity @xmath22cm / ns as this reflects the velocity of the incoming ion .",
    "exactly one outgoing @xmath23n is detected in the fragment branch ( both gfis , and tfw ) . in order to ensure the tracking of the incoming and outgoing particle , at least one hit in both planes of each of the four in - beam dsssds",
    "is required for data analysis .",
    "transitions of the impinging nucleus into an excited state of the outgoing nucleus are identified by measuring the gamma energy released during the deexcitation of the state . as the particles are strongly forward boosted ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the velocity divided by the speed of light @xmath27 ) , a correction for the doppler shift is applied .",
    "furthermore , the segmentation of the crystal ball makes it necessary to take care of hits in several crystals by using an addback algorithm which works as follows .",
    "single crystals with an energy @xmath28mev ( to suppress background due to bremsstrahlung ) are grouped to clusters which are used to calculate the entire emitted gamma - energy during the reaction of one impinging particle .    in the left panel of figure",

    "the blue , dashed line indicates a background estimation by gating on unreacted outgoing @xmath4n ( otherwise equal cuts as discussed in section [ sec : eventselection ] ) .",
    "this shows that the peak at 1.15mev is not caused by background events .",
    "furthermore , there is a high - energy tail with count rates half as large as that of the signal peak .",
    "these might correspond to higher lying states of @xmath23n .",
    "but due to the limited statistics and energy resolution , they can not be unambiguously identified .",
    "the gamma sum spectrum originating from deexcitations of @xmath4n is shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : gammasumspectra ] .",
    "a dominant peak is visible at @xmath30mev , again corresponding to the first excited state @xcite .",
    "only a small additional structure arises at 1.3mev and no significant structures are detected at @xmath31mev . as d. sohler et al .",
    "@xcite reported several peaks in the close vicinity of 850kev , and due to the limited energy resolution of our gamma spectra , the observed peak can not unambigiously be used to gate on the first excited state .",
    "therefore , a gate on transitions into the first plus the second excited state is given in the presented analysis .",
    "after applying the cuts for selecting the reaction channel , the reaction probabilities are obtained by dividing the number of reaction events ( see section [ sec : eventselection ] ) by the effective number of nuclei impinging onto the target .",
    "the latter value is derived by counting all outgoing nitrogen isotopes that are detected at the fragment arm , including the unreacted @xmath4n ( resp .",
    "@xmath5n ) ions .",
    "this automatically takes into account losses due to particles scattered out of the beamline , detector inefficiencies in the fragment arm , and applied cuts which together amount to 33% .",
    "the coulomb dissociation cross section follows as @xmath32 where the indices pb , c , and empty denote the specific targets ( lead , carbon , and no target ) , @xmath33 is the probability of the impinging particle to react with the target , @xmath34 is the molar mass of the material of the target , @xmath35 is the areal density of the target ( measured by weighing ) , @xmath36 is the avogadro s number , @xmath37 is the nuclear scaling factor derived in the following paragraph .",
    "the factor @xmath38 is necessary to scale the nuclear contribution measured with the carbon target to the much larger lead nuclei .",
    "the black disk model is used to estimate @xmath39 as @xmath40 , the choice of @xmath38 has only a limited influence on @xmath41 .",
    "the excitation energy @xmath42 of the reaction is extracted by the invariant mass method via @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the rest mass of the incoming nucleus , @xmath45 is the rest mass of the outgoing heavy reaction fragment , @xmath46 is the rest mass of the outgoing neutron , @xmath47 is the velocity of the outgoing heavy reaction fragment , @xmath48 is the velocity of the outgoing neutron , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the angle between the outgoing heavy reaction fragment and the neutron , while @xmath52 is the energy of all gamma quanta emitted during the reaction . here , due to the high photo - peak efficiency ( @xmath5370% ) of the crystal ball at the relatively low @xmath16-ray energies ( @xmath531mev )",
    ", @xmath52 is simply taken as the sum of the detected @xmath16-ray energies .",
    "this approximation entails a slight downward shift of the excitation function for coulomb dissociation into excited states of the product nucleus , which is not significant here , because those states contribute only negligibly to the reaction rate at the effective astrophysical temperatures , see below .",
    "the mass of the incoming @xmath4n ( resp .",
    "@xmath5n ) and the outgoing @xmath23n ( resp .",
    "@xmath4n ) were taken from the ame2003 mass evaluation @xcite .",
    "differences to the updated mass evaluation ame2012 @xcite amount to only 10kev , much less than the experimental resolution .",
    "an energy - dependent correction for the neutron detection efficiency must be applied to the coulomb dissociation cross section .",
    "the total neutron efficiency of land is based on a simulation which includes the acceptance due to the kinematics of the specific reaction , the acceptance due to deactivated / broken paddles and the nominal energy - dependent neutron efficiency of the detector measured in an earlier experiment @xcite .    for kinetic energies in the center of mass of @xmath54mev ,",
    "the neutrons are strongly forward boosted , so that all neutrons hit the active area of land .",
    "the efficiency drops dramatically for @xmath55mev as the transverse momentum component becomes more dominant and , thus , many neutrons miss the active area of land .    the kinetic energy of the neutrons in the center of mass system for the @xmath56 reaction is depicted in figure [ fig : neutronenergy ] .    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , > , < , < \" , ]",

    ", a random gaussian distribution is built where the bin content acts as mean value and the statistical uncertainty of the bin acts as sigma of the gaussian distribution .",
    "then , the randomly distributed neutron capture cross section is used to calculate the maxwellian averaged reaction rate for each temperature ( compare eq .",
    "[ eq : maxavereactrate ] ) , forcing the maxwellian averaged reaction rates to be positive definite .",
    "this procedure is repeated 1000 times , thus , for each temperature we generate 1000 times a maxwellian averaged reaction rate .",
    "then , the mean value of the resulting distribution is used as a value in the randomized maxwellian averaged reaction rate as a function of temperature while the root mean square ( rms ) acts as statistical uncertainty .    in order to judge how much the excited states contribute to the total reaction rate , the population of the first excited state of @xmath23n relative to the ground state is assumed to be @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the energy of the excited state ,",
    "@xmath64 the spin of the resonant state and @xmath65 the spin of the ground state .    in order to calculate the stellar reaction rate @xmath66 ,",

    "it should be noted that the dissociation cross sections were measured for nuclei in their ground state .",
    "therefore , the cross section and reaction rate determined using the detailed balance theorem only constrain the contribution of the ground state . as a result ,",
    "the contribution of low - energy first excited states , which are located at 843 and 1177 kev for @xmath0n respectively @xcite , to the total ( n,@xmath16 ) reaction rate is not constrained by the present measurement . in previous studies , the inclusion of the capture to thermally populated excited states has led to significant enhancement of the total cross section @xcite .",
    "then , the @xmath1 reaction rates as a function of the temperature are compared with reaction rates included in reaction network codes which are mainly based on one theoretical work @xcite considering just direct capture and giving a linear approximation .    in figure",

    "our measured data exceed the theoretical ones by up to a factor of three before the ratio drops below one and finally levels out at 0.1 of the theoretical predictions .    in figure",
    "[ fig : reactionrate_20n - ng-21n ] , the stellar neutron capture reaction rate of @xmath4n is shown in an analogous fashion to figure [ fig : reactionrate19n - ng-20n ] .",
    "again , we note that due to the limited resolution of the gamma spectra , we could not distinguish between the first and second excited state of @xmath4n . from equation [ eq : stellarreactionrate ]",
    ", one can see that this causes no major problem for the computation of the stellar reaction rate .",
    "as the spins of the first and second excited states in @xmath4n are equal @xcite , only the difference in energy contributes to an additional uncertainty .",
    "we estimate this additional uncertainty to be 2% of the stellar reaction rate , much less than the statistical uncertainty of @xmath72 10% . for lower temperatures ,",
    "the contribution of the uncertainty due to the limited energy resolution is even lower , as the population probability decreases with decreasing temperature .",
    "no theoretical predictions were available for this reaction @xcite .",
    "the references given by terasawa et al . in 2001 @xcite do not include this reaction rate .",
    "therefore , we show the stellar reaction rate without any comparison .    in figure [",
    "fig : reactionrate_20n - ng-21n ] , one can see that the stellar neutron capture reaction rate of @xmath4n is of the same order of magnitude compared to the one of @xmath23n . for temperatures",

    "in order to illustrate the impact of our measured reaction rates on the final elemental abundance of an r - process calculation , we included our reaction rates in a reaction network code @xcite .    as basic input , we downloaded the reaction network from the jina reaclib database @xcite .",
    "as several reactions on neutron - rich light nuclei were not included , we included the reaction rates of @xmath74b(n,@xmath16)@xmath75b , @xmath76c(n,@xmath16)@xmath77c , @xmath77c(n,@xmath16)@xmath23c , @xmath23c(n,@xmath16)@xmath4c , and @xmath77c(@xmath38,n)@xmath5o from sasaqui et al @xcite .",
    "the remaining reaction rates in @xcite were of references predating our reference network . in ref .",
    "@xcite , hauser - feshbach models were used to obtain estimates on the reaction rates for light neutron - rich nuclei . as the network calculation presented here",
    "is not supposed to explain the entire r - process nucleosynthesis , but only to give a rough impression of the impact of our measured reaction rates on the r - process , we omitted to derive new theoretical reaction rates .",
    "furthermore , we included the measured stellar reaction rate of @xmath4n(n,@xmath16)@xmath5n ( see previous section ) and updated the rate of @xmath23n(n,@xmath16)@xmath4n ( referred to as `` our network '' in the following ) .",
    "for comparison we created a second network ( referred to as `` reference network '' ) which included the reaction rate of @xmath23n(n,@xmath16)@xmath4n derived by rauscher et al . @xcite but included our rate of @xmath4n(n,@xmath16)@xmath5n as no previous reference for the latter reaction was available in the literature .    in order to simulate an r - process environment , we used the following trajectory for the evolution of density in time consisting of an exponential decay , reflecting the expanding medium of the supernova , and an additional slower decaying term , reflecting the neutrino wind @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79g/@xmath80 is the initial density ( at t = 0s ) of the exponential term , @xmath81g/@xmath80 is the constant density of the second term , @xmath82s is the decay constant of the exponential term .",
    "the temperature @xmath61 is parameterized as @xmath83 with @xmath84gk .",
    "these input parameters were chosen to match terasawa et al . @xcite .",
    "the initial neutron to proton ratio was set to 65/35 ( which corresponds to set 2 in table 4 of sasaqui et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    then , the network was run to calculate the reaction flow until @xmath85s after the supernova exploded . in figure",
    "[ fig : network_absoluteabundance ] , we extracted the abundance as a function of nucleon number at that time ( red line ) where the three main r - process peaks are visible at a = 79 , a = 130 , and a = 195 . for comparison we added the solar abundances of r - process elements as derived by kppeler et al .",
    "1989 @xcite ( black symbols ) and rescaled our data to match the height of the peak at a = 195 .",
    "our efforts on network calculations are not to understand the entire r - process in detail but to estimate the impact of our measured reaction rates on the r - process abundances .",
    "therefore , we use the abundances derived with our network for comparison with abundances computed when using the reference network ( see previous passage ) .",
    "we find a decrease of 10% for fluorine ( @xmath86 ) , but the abundances of nuclei with higher mass are unaffected by our data .    in figure",
    "[ fig : network_reactionflow ] , we show the reaction flow which is the contribution per nucleon per second to the abundance of one of the product species in the reaction .",
    "one can see that the reactions under study become important ( e.g. with a reaction flow @xmath87 ) at times within @xmath88$]s which correspond to temperatures @xmath89$]gk .",
    "thus , we measured the reaction rate exactly in the important temperature range .",
    "corrections due to neutron capture of excited states of the target nucleus play no role in this temperature range ( figures [ fig : reactionrate19n - ng-20n ] and [ fig : reactionrate_20n - ng-21n ] ) .    in order to gauge the possible impact of an increase in the reaction rate due to neutron capture into excited states of the product nucleus , which is not constrained by the present data ( see sec .

    "* summary : * we measured the coulomb dissociation cross section of @xmath0n and discriminated between transitions into the ground state and the first excited state of the outgoing nuclei . in the case of @xmath5n , we could not separate the first from the second excited state due to the limited resolution of our gamma calorimeter . therefore , we presented only transitions into any excited state of the outgoing @xmath4n ions .    furthermore , we calculated the photo absorption cross sections via the virtual photon theory and the neutron capture cross section by using the principle of detailed balance for each individual reaction , discriminating for the excitation level of the outgoing particle . in these cases ,",
    "the ground state contributions had such a low statistical uncertainty that only an upper limit could be presented .",
