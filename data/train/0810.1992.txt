    "ground - state kohn - sham ( ks ) density functional theory ( dft ) is a widely - used tool for electronic structure calculations of atoms , molecules , and solids @xcite , in which only the density functional for the exchange - correlation energy , @xmath1 $ ] , must be approximated .",
    "but a direct , orbital - free density functional theory could be constructed if only the non - interacting kinetic energy , @xmath2 , were known sufficiently accurately as an explicit functional of the density @xcite .",
    "using it would lead automatically to an electronic structure method that scales linearly with the number of electrons @xmath3 ( with the possible exception of the evaluation of the hartree energy ) .",
    "thus the ks kinetic energy functional is something of a holy grail of density functional purists , and interest in it has recently revived @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we exploit the  unreasonable accuracy \" of asymptotic expansions @xcite , in this case for large neutral atoms , to show that there is a very simple exact condition that approximations to @xmath2 must satisfy , if they are to attain high accuracy for total energies of matter . by matter , we mean all atoms , molecules , and solids that consist of electrons in the field of nuclei , attracted by a coulomb potential .",
    "the exact condition is the ( known ) asymptotic expansion of @xmath4 for neutral atoms , in powers of @xmath5 . by careful extrapolation from accurate numerical calculations up to @xmath6",
    ", we calculate the coefficients of this expansion .",
    "we find that the usual gradient expansion , derived from the slowly - varying gas , but applied to essentially exact densities , yields only a good approximation to these coefficients .",
    "thus , all new approximations should either build in these coefficients , or be tested to see how well they approximate them .",
    "we perform several tests , using atoms , molecules , jellium surfaces , and jellium spheres , and analyze two existing approximations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a related method was used to derive the gradient coefficient in modern generalized gradient approximations ( gga s ) for exchange .",
    "given this importance of @xmath7 as a condition on functionals , we revisited and improved upon the existing parametrizations of the neutral - atom thomas - fermi ( tf ) density .",
    "the second - half of the paper is devoted to testing its accuracy .",
    "for an @xmath3-electron system , the hamiltonian is = + + , [ eq : hamil ] where @xmath8 is the kinetic energy operator , @xmath9 the external potential , and @xmath10 the electron - electron interaction , respectively . the electron density @xmath11 yields @xmath12 , where @xmath3 is the particle number .    to explain asymptotic exactness , we ( re)-introduce the @xmath13-scaled potential @xcite ( which is further discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , given by v^ ( ) = ^4/3 v(^1/3 ) ,  nn , [ vzeta ] where @xmath14 is the external potential , and the thomas - fermi expectation value is @xmath15=\\zeta^{7/3}v\\ext[n]$ ] . in this @xmath13-scaling scheme , nuclear positions @xmath16 and charges @xmath17 of molecules are scaled into @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively . in a uniform electric field , @xmath20 . for neutral atoms ,",
    "scaling @xmath13 is the same as scaling @xmath21 , and this gives schwinger s asymptotic expansion for the total energy of neutral atoms @xcite , e = - c_0 z^7/3 - c_1 z^2 - c_2 z^5/3 + , [ ezasymp ] where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath21 is the atomic number .",
    "this large @xmath21-expansion gives a remarkably good approximation to the hartree - fock energy of the neutral atoms , with less than a 10% error for h , and less than 0.5% error for ne . by the virial theorem for neutral atoms , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 to this order in the expansion ( since the correlation energy is roughly @xmath27 ) .",
    "hence , the non - interacting kinetic energy has the following asymptotic expansion .",
    "t= c_0 z^7/3 + c_1",
    "z^2 + c_2 z^5/3 + [ tszasymp ]    we say that an approximation to the kinetic energy functional is _ asymptotically exact _ to the @xmath28-th degree if it can reproduce the exact @xmath29 .",
    "the three displayed terms in eq .",
    "( [ ezasymp ] ) constitute the second - order asymptotic expansion for the total energy of neutral atoms , and we expect that this asymptotic expansion is a better starting point for constructing a more accurate approximation to the kinetic energy functional than the traditional gradient expansion approximation ( gea ) .    the leading term in eq . ( [ tszasymp ] )",
    "is given _ exactly _ by a local approximation to @xmath2 ( tf theory ) , but the leading _ correction _ is due to higher - order quantum effects , and only approximately given by the gradient expansion evaluated on the density .",
    "however , these coefficients are _ vital _ to finding accurate kinetic energies .",
    "since we know that @xmath30 becomes exact as @xmath7 , we define @xmath31 and investigate @xmath32 as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "how accurate is the asymptotic expansion for @xmath32 ? in figure",
    "[ f : deltats ] , we evaluate @xmath2 for atoms within the optimized effective potential ( oep )",
    "@xcite using the exact exchange functional and plot the percentage error in @xmath32 , for all atoms and the asymptotic series with just two terms .",
    "the series is incredibly accurate , with only a 13% error for @xmath3=2 ( he ) , and 14% for @xmath3=1 .",
    "thus , any approximation that reproduces the correct asymptotic series ( up to and including the @xmath33 term ) is likely to produce a highly accurate @xmath2 .     and @xmath34.,height=207 ]    to demonstrate the power and the significance of this approach ,",
    "we apply it directly to the first term ( where the answer is already known , but perhaps not yet fully appreciated in the dft community ) . using any ( all - electron ) electronic structure code ,",
    "one calculates the total energies of atoms for a sequence running down a column . by sticking with a specific column",
    ", one reduces the oscillatory contributions across rows , and the alkali - earth column yields the most accurate results . by then fitting the resulting curve of @xmath4 as a function of @xmath5 to a parabola",
    ", one finds @xmath35 .",
    "now assume one wishes to make a local density approximation ( lda ) to @xmath2 , but knows nothing about the uniform electron gas .",
    "dimensional analysis yields @xcite t= a i ,  i= d^3r n^5/3 ( ) , [ eq : tloc ] but does not determine the constant , @xmath36 .",
    "a similar fitting of @xmath37 , based on the self - consistent densities evaluated using the oep exact exchange functional , gives a leading term of 0.2677 @xmath38 , yielding @xmath39 .",
    "thus we have deduced the local approximation to the non - interacting kinetic energy .",
    "a careful inspection of the above argument reveals that the uniform electron gas is never mentioned .",
    "as @xmath3 grows , the wavelength of the majority of the particles becomes short relative to the scale on which the potential is changing , loosely speaking , and semiclassical behavior dominates .",
    "the local approximation is a universal semiclassical result , which is exact for a uniform gas simply because that system has a constant potential . on the basis of that argument , we know the exact value is @xmath36=@xmath40 , demonstrating that ( for this case ) our result is accurate to about 0.1% .",
    "this argument tells us that the reliability of the local approximation is no indicator of how rapidly the density varies . that this argument is correct for neutral atoms",
    "was carefully proven by lieb and simon in 1973 @xcite and later generalized by lieb to all matter @xcite .",
    "the focus of the first part of this paper is on the remaining two known coefficients ( @xmath41 and @xmath33 ) and how well the gea performs for them .",
    "we evaluate those gradient terms by fitting asymptotic series exactly and we find that the gradient expansion does well , but is not exact . from this information , we develop a modified gradient expansion approximation that reproduces the exact asymptotic coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath33 , merely as an illustration of the power of asymptotic exactness .",
    "we test it on a variety of systems , finding the expected behavior .    in section [ sec :",
    "mtf ] , we present a parametrization of the tf density which is more accurate than previous parametrizations .",
    "the tf density has a simple scaling with @xmath21 and becomes relatively exact and slowly - varying for a neutral atom as @xmath42 , breaking down only near the nucleus and in the tail .",
    "we compare various quantities of our parametrization with exact values and earlier parametrizations , and analyze the properties of the tf density .",
    "we begin with a careful methodology for extracting the asymptotic behavior from highly accurate numerical calculations .",
    "fully numerical dft calculations were performed using the opmks code @xcite to calculate the total energies of neutral atoms using the oep exact exchange functional .",
    "the spin - density functional version of @xmath2 has been used for all systems @xcite .     and @xmath43 as a function of @xmath5 with exact asymptotic coefficients.,height=207 ]    to attain maximum accuracy for @xmath41 and @xmath33 , we need to suppress the oscillations which come from the next term , @xmath44 .",
    "consider first the oep results .",
    "we investigate the differences between @xmath45 and @xmath43 with exact asymptotic coefficients in figure [ f : deltaosc ] .",
    "we extract 6 data points ( @xmath21=24 ( cr ) , 25 ( mn ) , 30 ( zn ) , 31 ( ga ) , 61 ( pm ) , and 74 ( w ) ) which have the smallest differences , i.e. , nearest to where the curve crosses the horizontal axis .",
    "we then make a least - squares fit with a parabolic form in @xmath5 , ignoring the oscillation term , = 0.768745+c_1z^-1/3+c_2z^-2/3 .",
    "[ eq : fitting ] effectively , we solve two linear equations for @xmath41 and @xmath33 .",
    "we explicitly include the exact @xmath46 , since we do nt have enough data points to extract @xmath47 accurately , especially in the region @xmath48 .",
    "it is important to control the behavior of the fitting line at @xmath0 .",
    "this fitting yields a good estimate of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , with error less than 1% .",
    "this demonstrates the accuracy of our method for @xmath51 and @xmath33 ( by construction ) .",
    "we repeat the same procedure to extract @xmath51 and @xmath52 coefficients of tf and second- and fourth - order gea s which are given by t^gea2= t+ t^(2 ) , and @xcite : t^gea4= t+ t^(2)+t^(4 ) .",
    "these gradient corrections to the local approximation are given by t^(2 ) = d^3r ( ) s^2 ( ) , [ t2 ] and t^(4 ) = d^3r ( ) , [ t4 ] where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are defined as ( ) = k^2()n ( ) , [ t0 ] s()= , [ s ] q()= , [ q2 ] and @xmath56 .",
    "we have also applied this procedure to both @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "since the asymptotic expansions of these energies begin at @xmath59 , we extract only a @xmath51 and a @xmath52 for each using the following equations : & = & c_1z^-1/3 + c_2z^-2/3 , + & = & c_1z^-1/3 + c_2z^-2/3 .",
    "these results are also included in table [ t : coeffalea ] , and are of course consistent with our results from eq .",

    "the fit was made to @xmath21=24 ( cr ) , 25 ( mn ) , 30 ( zn ) , 31 ( ga ) , 61 ( pm ) , and 74 ( w ) .",
    "the functionals of the last two rows are defined in section [ s : interp ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table2 ]    table [ table2 ] shows that our modern parametrization is far more accurate than existing models by all measures , and that our simple pedagogical model is roughly correct for many features .    finally , we make some comparisons with densities of real atoms to illustrate those features of real atoms that are captured by tf .",

    "there are three rungs of semilocal approximations ( followed by higher rungs of fully nonlocal ones ) .",
    "the lda uses only the local density , the gga uses also the density gradient , and the meta - gga uses in addition the orbital kinetic energy density or the laplacian of the density . for the exchange - correlation energy ,",
