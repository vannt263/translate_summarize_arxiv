    "the iron selenide fese superconductor , being simplest with respect to its crystal structure , is the most unusual compound among the large family of iron based high temperature superconductors ( htsc ) .",
    "in fact , it is the only compound which remains in the nonmagnetic metallic state for temperatures down to 0.02 k.  @xcite furthermore , it becomes superconducting in the pure stoichiometry phase ,  @xcite i.e. without doping in contrast to other htsc members . at first glance",
    "it is a conventional superconductor with a modest transition temperature of @xmath4 k at ambient pressure .",
    "@xcite however , it shows an enormous growth of @xmath5 up to 37 k at pressures of 9 gpa ,  @xcite suggesting that the lattice subsystem plays a role in the superconductivity .    from magnetic point of view fese and its main building blocks of fese@xmath6 tetrahedra",
    "demonstrate amazing features : a stoichiometric fese thin film on a @xmath7-plane sapphire substrate is a ferromagnetic metal with a curie temperature above 300 k.  @xcite moreover , in the recently discovered iron selenides intercalated by alkali ions @xmath8fe@xmath9se@xmath10 ( @xmath11 = k , rb , cs )  @xcite the fese@xmath6 tetrahedra in the fese layers stay in two different spin states . in the insulating and",
    "magnetically ordered part of the phase separated sample the fese@xmath6 tetrahedra are in the high spin state with a magnetic moment of 3.3 @xmath12 per tetrahedron at 10 k.  @xcite in the nonmagnetic metallic and superconductive phase of the @xmath8fe@xmath9se@xmath10 system the fese@xmath6 tetrahedra remain in their low spin state ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "all of these observations point to an easy switching between the low ( @xmath3 ) , intermediate ( @xmath13 ) , and high ( @xmath14 ) iron spin states in the layers of fese@xmath6 tetrahedra and a pronounced instability of the iron spin states .",
    "this instability is governed by distortions of the tetrahedra and in particular by the flexible change of the height ( @xmath15-coordinate ) of the se ions above the fe plane .",
    "thus , it suggests the presence of rather specific longitudinal spin fluctuations in fese which are intimately connected to the lattice .    actually , nonuniform , @xmath16 , antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in fese , seen in nmr experiments ,  @xcite are reported to be strong and increasing near the superconducting transition temperature .",
    "furthermore , applied pressure enhances these spin fluctuations together with an increasing @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite however , the uniform @xmath17 paramagnetic spin susceptibility , which is derived from the nmr knight shift , shows an almost linear decrease under temperature lowering .",
    "@xcite this observation can be interpreted as an unexpected suppression of the uniform spin fluctuations in fese with decreasing temperature .",
    "the temperature evolution of spin fluctuations should be seen in the lattice dynamics through a high sensitivity of the phonon energies on the varying iron spin states .",
    "@xcite already earlier first principle studies for `` 1111 '' and `` 122 '' systems have revealed a strong dependence of the @xmath15-atom positions from the fe spin state .  @xcite it was shown that under external pressure",
    ", the high fe - spin state structure should transform to a structure with low fe - spin state and significantly reduced @xmath7-axis .",
    "recent experimental and theoretical studies of the zone center phonons in the isostructural fete  a magnetic and nonsuperconductive relative of fese  have shown that the real magnetic moment of the fe ions should be included in spin polarised lattice dynamic calculations to achieve an agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "@xcite furthermore , the high frequency part of phonon spectra which in the iron chalcogenides htsc mostly consists of iron vibrations shows a giant high frequency shift under a decrease of the iron magnetic moment .",
    "the underlying physics of this phenomenon is related to strong orbital reordering under a change of the spin state .",
    "here we report results from raman light scattering and ab - initio lattice dynamic calculations of recently grown high quality fese single crystals .",
    "we demonstrate that a dynamical spin state instability is realized in fese at high temperatures .",
    "strong dynamical fluctuations of the iron spin state are seen as a renormalization of the b@xmath1(fe ) phonon energy at high temperatures with a dominance of the high spin state . under temperature lowering these fluctuations decrease due to the appearance of an energy gap between different spin states with mainly low spin state presence .",
    "this is observed as an additional phonon frequency hardening which highly exceeds the usual temperature dependent hardening given by the grneisen law .",
    "the presence of mainly low and high spin fluctuating states in the paramagnetic ground state in fese is seen as a one order narrowing of the phonon linewidth compared to the width of those modes in fete where a highly orbital frustrated intermediate spin state determines its properties .",
    "@xcite the suppression of spin state fluctuations is continuous and smooth with lowering temperatures .",
    "below 150 k we observe a highly polarized low frequency background which becomes a gap - like structure .",
    "this feature is attributed to a gap opening between a manifold of intermediate spin states and the paramagnetic ground state in fese .",
    "our findings shed light on the mechanism that prevents magnetic order and the appearance of a superconducting state in fese .",

    "at first , two issues of our observations should be addressed : ( i ) the strong hardening of the b@xmath1(fe ) phonon frequency which is more than two times stronger compares to the expected one from lattice shrinking and the grneisen law and also very different from the modest hardening of the a@xmath1(se ) phonon mode ; and ( ii ) the existence of a very narrow phonon linewidth on the background of the strong and continuous phonon hardening , meaning that the mechanism of hardening does not contribute to the phonon decay .",
    "note , that in the fete we observed a very conventional hardening of the b@xmath1(fe ) mode with @xmath59 which is close to the expected @xmath57 .",
    "@xcite hence , there is no specific mechanism of hardening in the fete . at the same time",
    "both raman active modes in fete demonstrate a very unconventional line width , one order larger compared to fese .",
    "the difference between these two compounds is the spin state of iron . in fe@xmath36te for temperatures below magnetic ordering",
    "the magnetic moment is around 2 @xmath12/fe depending on the excess of iron content @xmath26 .",
    "@xcite this magnetic moment supposes the iron spin state to be intermediate @xmath13 which is highly orbital frustrated .",
    "indeed , a few types of alternating orbital ordering patterns , which are consistent with the magnetically ordered structure , have been found to occur in iron pnictide superconductors .",
    "@xcite in our paper  @xcite we argued that in fete the orbital frustration mechanism resulting from the fe intermediate spin state creates an additional channel for phonon decay .",
    "as a proof of this we observed an almost doubling of the b@xmath1(fe ) phonon linewidth at the structural / magnetic phase transition at which strong orbital fluctuations are naturally expected .",
    "in contrast , in fese no visible response of linewidth of both b@xmath1(fe ) and a@xmath1(se ) phonon modes at the structural phase transition is observed .",
    "thus , one can safely conclude that the orbital channel of phonon decay is not dominant in fese and , particularly , it is not relevant to the mechanism of the structural phase transitions in fese .",
    "note , that at the @xmath70 second order ferroelastic phase transition , which is realized in fese , the optic phonons are not affected and some acoustic mode demonstrates a soft mode behaviour through lowering of its sound velocity for wave vectors much lower than the brillouin zone boundary . in fese this effect has been studied .",
    "@xcite such kind of acoustic phonon softening also does not affect the standard lattice anharmonicity channel of optic phonon decay .",
    "therefore the phonons linewidths remain unchanged through passing @xmath2 ( see fig .  [ fitparameters ] c , d )",
    ". the only manifestation of the structural phase transition in fese in our raman spectra is seen in the continuous increase in scattering intensity below @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "[ fitparameters ] e , f ) .",
    "this effect can be connected with some rearrangement in polarizability caused by orthorhombic distortions and its increase under lowering temperature .    concluding the experimental observations ,",
    "the above comparison of fete and fese phonon is compatible with an intermediate spin state for fete in the whole investigated temperature regime . as this state",
    "is unaltered it does not contribute to phonon hardening , while it is a source of strong orbital fluctuations .",
    "on the other hand , the mechanism of strong phonon hardening for fese does not contain frustrating orbital degrees of freedom . at low temperature , however , the iron ions should be in the low spin state which has no spin orbital frustration similar as the high spin states .",
    "we naturally arrive to the conclusion that at high temperatures the iron ions in fese reside in the high spin state and the source of the strong b@xmath1(fe ) phonon hardening is _ a dynamical crossover _ from the high to low spin state with temperature lowering .",
    "the corresponding strong hardening of the high frequency part of the phonon spectrum in fete upon decrease of iron magnetic moment has already previously been found in our earlier studies .",
    "@xcite    to further illustrate this interplay we performed ab - inito lattice dynamic calculations of fese under varying magnetic moments at the iron sites within the framework of density functional theory ( dft ) and a frozen phonon approach .",
    "we applied the all - electron full - potential linearized augmented plane wave method ( elk code )  @xcite with the local spin density approximation ( lsda )  @xcite for the exchange correlation potential and with the revised generalized gradient approximation of perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbesol ) .",
    "@xcite the calculations were performed on a @xmath71 grid which corresponds to 60 points in the irreducible brillouin zone .",
    "we used the experimental unit cell parameters for fese in the tetragonal phase at 300 k  @xcite at ambient pressure with the unit cell lattice constants fixed . to reproduce the fluctuating magnetic moments in the paramagnetic phase we replaced them by static ones and suggested some kind of magnetic order",
    "the spin - polarized calculations were performed with and without structure optimization for m@xmath72 and with structure optimization for m@xmath73 . in the latter case a checkerboard type of antiferromagnetic ordering with magnetic moments along the @xmath7-axis",
    "was supposed .",
    "the results of our calculations and a comparison with the experiment are given in table i.    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as we expected the results for optimized structures do not coincide with the experiments giving highly overestimated a@xmath1(se ) and b@xmath1(fe ) phonon frequencies for both m = 0 and m = 2 @xmath12 iron magnetic moments .",
    "this is due to a too low value of the calculated se ion height ( @xmath74 ) that correspondingly decreases the fe - se distance compared to the experimental ones .",
    "however , these results simulate the phonon frequency behavior under decrease of iron magnetic moments .",
    "as one can see , the frequency of the b@xmath1(fe ) phonon drastically increases when the size of magnetic moments changes from m = 2 @xmath12 to m = 0 , while the a@xmath1(se ) phonon frequency undergoes modest change .",
    "note that we do not discuss here the question about the importance and necessity of spin - polarized calculations in iron htsc to obtain true phonon frequencies and electron - phonon coupling constants that are now generally accepted  @xcite but we focus on the phonon energy dependence on the size of the magnetic moment .",
    "the spin polarized calculations without structure optimization with m = 0 give much better coincidence with the experiment for the a@xmath1(se ) mode but again overestimate the b@xmath1(fe ) mode .",
    "this overestimation is expected , as the experimental value of @xmath74 at 300 k is higher than the calculated @xmath74 not only for m = 0 but also for static magnetic moment m@xmath75 .",
    "the high value of @xmath74 corresponds to a high magnitude of the magnetic moment ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , one can conclude that under dynamical spin state fluctuations the iron paramagnetic moment at 300 k should exceed 2 @xmath12 .",
    "this estimation is in qualitative agreement with probing of the local magnetic moment in the fete@xmath76se@xmath77 by fe @xmath78 x - ray emission spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite at room temperature they found 2 @xmath12 for a fluctuating local magnetic moment in the paramagnetic phase . note , that in the raman studies of the superconductive fe@xmath36te@xmath37se@xmath38 compounds the b@xmath1(fe ) mode shows almost the same features of frequency hardening and linewidth narrowing as in our case .",
    "@xcite this implies the same mechanism of this phenomena for these compositions .    summarizing our treatment of experimental and calculated data on the width and anomalous hardening of the b@xmath1(fe )",
    "phonon we conclude that the paramagnetic ground state in fese can be presented as a superposition of low and high iron spin states with larger contribution of the high spin state at room temperature . under temperature",
    "lowering the comparative contribution of those states undergoes a rearrangement with a continuous growth of the low spin state part over the high spin state part .",
    "this is seen as a decrease of the ground state paramagnetic moment .",
    "a specific spin - state lattice coupling is contributing to the b@xmath1(fe ) phonon hardening which does not create an additional channel for phonon decay and linewidth increase .",
    "our indirect observation of the fe paramagnetic moment decrease is in nice agreement with the almost linear lowering of the paramagnetic spin susceptibility with decreasing temperatures in fese which has been observed in the nmr experiments .",
    "@xcite the idea of representing the magnetic ground state in iron based htsc as a coherent superposition of different spin states has recently been proposed and discussed .",
    "@xcite here we conclude that the paramagnetic ground state in fese combines both low and high spin states and does not include the intermediate spin state .",
    "furthermore , the result of our calculation for non optimized structure with m = 0 at 300 k can be used to roughly estimate the expected phonon frequencies at low temperatures . indeed , in first approximation one can neglect contributions to the hardening from thermal lattice contraction as the main contribution comes from the change of the iron spin state . then supposing m = 0 , as it should be expected at lowest @xmath53 , we still have a disagreement between theory ( 218.8 @xmath34 ) and experiment ( 206.5 @xmath34 ) in the b@xmath1(fe ) phonon frequency at 7 k , supposing that m @xmath79 .",
    "this is evidence for residual spin fluctuations ( nonzero contribution of high spin state ) which survive even at 7 k  the lowest temperature of our experiment . in other words",
    ", fese remains in a paramagnetic metallic state upon approaching the superconductive state .",
    "interestingly , this estimation has resemblance with results of an inelastic neutron scattering experiment in fete@xmath80se@xmath81 where a small fluctuating magnetic moment was found below @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite this system again shows similar features in the raman spectra as observed in fese .",
    "@xcite    our most intriguing observation in fese is the onset and development of a highly polarized low frequency background below 150 k which becomes gap - like under temperature lowering .",
    "this feature exists only in the @xmath68-polarization channel of scattering ( b@xmath44-channel in the tetragonal setting ) .",
    "meanwhile , we see an almost temperature independent background in all other polarizations ( see fig .  [ polarization ] ) . to be sure with the sign and value of the respective raman tensors we checked this response in @xmath82 and @xmath83 polarization geometry ( not shown here ) and no antisymmetric contribution into raman tensors has been found .",
    "thus we conclude that this background does not come from pure magnetic excitations or magnetic fluctuations . as seen in the fig .",
    "[ differential ] c the quasi - elastic part of the @xmath68-raman spectra starts to develop around 150 k and reaches a characteristic maximum of intensity at @xmath2 with a following decrease towards low temperatures .",
    "note , that the order parameter @xmath84 ( type of lattice distortion ) of the tetra - ortho phase transition has the same symmetry as the excitations seen in the @xmath68-polarization channel of scattering . due to this symmetry and characteristic increase at @xmath2",
    "we ascribe the quasi - elastic part of scattering to the fluctuation of the @xmath85 lattice distortions .",
    "its existence in the raman spectra in a wide temperature regime far above and far below of @xmath2 points to a very unusual short - ranged lattice instability which persists even in the tetragonal phase .",
    "the rhombic instability of the tetragonal phase is usually considered a fingerprint of the electronic nematic fluctuations in underdoped iron htsc .  @xcite    the gap - like feature shows a gradual increase of the frequency of its most intensive spectral weight starting from 150 k and up to 60 k. the frequency becomes saturated at lower temperatures at the energy @xmath86 @xmath34 .",
    "a very similar @xmath87 @xmath34 energy gap with a similar gap onset below 130  140 k has been observed recently in fese using time - resolved optical spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite the gap size there was restored from indirect measurements and modeling which might explain the difference from our direct observation of the gap value .",
    "the gap onset accompanies a striking reduction in optical reflectivity and an increase of the hall coefficient  @xcite both signaling strong alterations in the electronic orbital and spin subsystems of fese below 150 k at the fermi level .",
    "furthermore , the hump excitations we observe have the symmetry of transitions between manifolds of electronic intermediate spin states and low and high spin states , that are allowed to be observed in @xmath68 polarization .",
    "thus , the gapped manifold of the intermediate spin states as well as accompanying orbital degrees of freedom do not participate in the formation of the paramagnetic ground state .",
    "this might explain the absence of orbital frustration in the fese paramagnetic ground state which we detect as a very narrow phonon linewidth .",
    "interestingly , some alteration in the whole spin states manifold as well as in the appearance of the spin state gap have been supported also by observation of an anomalous change of the slope in the temperature dependence of the se @xmath15 coordinate that happens around 150 k.  @xcite    our findings also lead back to the question of the magnetic origin of the structural tetra - ortho phase transition in the `` 11 '' family . in spite of its occurrence in fese without the onset of magnetic order like in fete , it occurs in fese on the background of some alteration in the magnetic subsystems .",
    "note , in previous studies the existence of a structural phase transition similar to fete in nonmagnetic fese was the reason to decline the hypothesis about its magnetic origin .",
    "our experimental results as well as lattice dynamical calculations reveal a temperature evolution of the paramagnetic state in fese from the high iron spin state ( @xmath14 ) to the low iron spin state .",
    "we establish a high sensitivity of the b@xmath1(fe ) phonon mode , that is a characteristic mode of the fese@xmath6 tetrahedron layers , to the fe spin state .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate the relevance of spin - orbital frustration despite a considerable metallicity of these systems .",
    "our scenario and the comparison of fese with fete underlines the complexity of fe high temperature superconductors with respect to their lattice and electronic degrees of freedom .",
