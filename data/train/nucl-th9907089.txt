    "in this paper we consider the effect of possible mass shifts in the dense medium on two boson correlations in general . thus far",
    "medium modifications of hadron masses have been mainly considered in terms of effects on such observables as dilepton yields and spectra .",
    "hadron mass shifts are caused by interactions in a dense medium and therefore vanish on the freeze - out surface .",
    "thus , a naive first expectation is that in medium hadron modifications may have little or no effect on two boson correlations , and so the usual hanbury - brown twiss ( hbt ) effect @xcite has been expected to be only concerned with the geometry and matter flow gradients on the freeze - out surface .",
    "however , in this paper we show that an interesting quantum mechanical correlation is induced due to the fact that medium modified bosons can be represented in terms of two - mode squeezed states of the asymptotic bosons , which are observables .    in this paper",
    "we assume the validity of relativistic hydrodynamics up to freeze - out . the local temperature @xmath0 and chemical potential @xmath1 are given . in relativistic heavy ion collisions at cern sps , it has been observed that the one particle spectra @xcite , simultaneously with the two particle correlation function , can be described by ( local ) thermal distributions fairly precisely  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the sudden approximation is a valid abstraction in describing the freeze - out process in relativistic heavy ion collisions quantum mechanically and that there exists an abrupt freeze - out surface , @xmath2 .",
    "let us consider the following model hamiltonian for a scalar field @xmath3 in the rest frame of matter , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the asymptotic hamiltonian .",
    "the field @xmath3 in @xmath6 corresponds to quasi - particles that propagate with a momentum - dependent effective mass , which is related to the vacuum mass , @xmath7 , via @xmath8 .",
    "the mass - shift is assumed to be limited to long wavelength collective modes .    the invariant single - particle and two - particle momentum distributions are given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the annihilation operator for the asymptotic quantum with four - momentum @xmath11 , @xmath12 and the expectation value of an operator @xmath13 is given by the density matrix @xmath14 as @xmath15 .",
    "we introduce the chaotic and squeezed amplitudes , defined , respectively , as @xmath16 in most situations , the chaotic amplitude , @xmath17 is dominant , and carries the bose - einstein correlations , while the squeezed amplitude , @xmath18 vanishes : @xmath19 the exact value of the intercept , @xmath20 , is a characteristic signature of a chaotic bose gas without dynamical 2-body correlations .",
    "the terms neglected in ( [ hbt ] ) involving @xmath18 become non - negligible when @xmath21 .",
    "given such a mass shift , the dispersion relation is modified to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the frequency of the in - medium mode with momentum @xmath24 . the annihilation operator for the in - medium quasi - particle with momentum @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and that of the asymptotic field , @xmath10 , are related by a bogoliubov transformation @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 $ ] , @xmath28 $ ] , and @xmath29 . as is well - known",
    ", the bogoliubov transformation is equivalent to a squeezing operation , and so we call @xmath30 the mode dependent squeezing parameter . while it is the @xmath31-quanta that are observed , it is the @xmath32-quanta that are thermalized in medium .",
    "thus , we consider the thermal average for a globally thermalized gas of the @xmath32-quanta , that is homogeneous in volume @xmath33 : @xmath34 when this thermal average is applied , @xmath35 , ~ g_s(1,2 ) = \\sqrt{\\omega_{{\\bf k}_1 } \\omega_{{\\bf k}_2 } } \\left [ \\langle s^\\dagger_{-1 } c^{\\phantom\\dagger}_2 \\rangle + \\langle c^{\\phantom\\dagger}_1 s^\\dagger_{-2 } \\rangle   \\right]\\ ! .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the homogeneous case , the resulting two particle correlation function is unity except for the parallel and anti - parallel cases .",
    "the _ dynamical _ correlation due to the two mode squeezing associated with mass shifts is therefore _ back - to - back _ as first pointed out in @xcite .",
    "the hbt correlation intercept remains 2 for identical momenta .",
    "evaluating @xmath36 for @xmath37 mev , @xmath38  500 mev for @xmath39 mesons , as a function of @xmath40 , one finds back - to - back correlations ( bbc ) as big as 100  1000 for reasonable values of @xmath40 .",
    "note , that these novel bbc - s are not bounded from above , @xmath41 . with increasing values of @xmath42 these bbc - s increase indefinitely .",
    "the huge bbc of decaying medium is , however , reduced if the decay of the medium is not completely sudden . to describe a more gradual freeze - out ,",
    "the probability distribution @xmath43 of the decay times @xmath44 is introduced .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath45 is @xmath46 $ ] , which leads to @xmath47 \\right |^2 .",

    "1 , which shows that the bbc survives the suppression with a strength as large as 2 - 3 .",
    "following ref.@xcite , we divide the inhomogeneous fluid into cells labeled @xmath50 . in each cell",
    ", it is assumed that the field can be expanded with creation and annihilation operators , and that @xmath51 is diagonalized by a local bogoliubov transformation , that implies @xmath52,\\label{e : gc } \\\\",

    "@xcite for further details .",
    "the correlation function in the presence of local squeezing is given by @xmath61 as the bogoliubov transformation always mixes particles with anti - particles , the above expression holds only for the case where particles are equivalent to their anti - particles , e.g. the @xmath39 meson and @xmath62 .",
    "however , the extension to the case where particles and their anti - particles are different is straightforward ; correlations between particles and anti - particles such as @xmath63 and @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and so forth , appear  @xcite .",
    "2 illustrates the novel character of bbc for two identical bosons caused by medium mass - modifications , along with the familiar bose - einstein or hbt correlations on the diagonal of the @xmath67 plane .",
