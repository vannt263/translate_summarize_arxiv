    "topological quantum computation has recently emerged as one of the most intriguing paradigms for the storage and manipulation of quantum information  @xcite .",
    "the defining features of topological order , namely the existence of degenerate ground states which ( i ) share the same thermodynamic properties and ( ii ) can only be distinguished by a global measurement , portend for a true many - body protection of quantum information .",
    "additionally , the non - abelian anyons which typically appear in these models are crucial for the active manipulation of the information , to be accomplished through their adiabatic braiding  @xcite .    among the several systems featuring topological order , free p - wave superconducting systems with symmetry protected topological properties",
    "have lately attracted a significant amount of attention  @xcite .",
    "on the one hand , they are exactly - solvable fermionic models which help building a clear physical intuition of some aspects of topological order  @xcite . on the other one , they are physically relevant , and several articles have recently reported experimental evidences to be linked to p - wave - like superconductors featuring zero - energy majorana modes  @xcite .",
    "whereas up to now these experimental results have been obtained in solid - state setups , it is natural to ask whether such physics might as well be observed in cold atomic gases  @xcite , which owing to their well - controlled microscopic physics should allow for a more thorough understanding of these peculiar phases of matter .",
    "important theoretical efforts have thus proposed a variety of schemes which exploit in different ways several properties of such setups  @xcite .    among these ideas ,",
    "that of a dissipative preparation of interesting many - body quantum states  @xcite is particularly appealing : rather than suffering from some unavoidable open - system dynamics , such as three - body losses or spontaneous emission , one tries to take advantage of it ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for the case of states with topological order , such as p - wave superconductors ) .",
    "the key point is the engineering of an environment that in the long - time limit drives the system into the desired quantum state .",
    "this approach has the remarkable advantage of being a workaround to the ultra - low temperatures necessary for the observation of important quantum phenomena which constitute a particularly severe obstacle in fermionic systems .",
    "the trust is thus that the mentioned `` non - equilibrium cooling '' may open the path towards the experimental investigation of currently unattainable states , e.g. characterized by p - wave superconductivity .    in this article",
    "we discuss the dissipative engineering of a p - wave superconductor with a fixed number of particles , an important constraint in cold - atom experiments .",
    "we consider two different setups : ( i ) a single quantum wire , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite ; this system displays the typical features of a p - wave superconductor but it is not topological in its number conserving variant .",
    "( ii ) a two - leg ladder  @xcite , supporting a dissipative dynamics which entails a two - dimensional steady state space characterized by p - wave superconducting order with boundary majorana modes for every fixed particle number .",
    "we identify the p - wave superconducting nature of the steady states by studying the proper correlators , which saturate to a finite value in the long distance limit .",
    "their topological properties are best discussed using a mathematical connection between dark states of the markovian dynamics and ground states of a suitable parent hamiltonian . in both setups",
    "we demonstrate that the dissipative gap closes at least polynomially in the system size and thus that the typical decay time to the steady state diverges in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this contrasts with the case where number conservation is not enforced . in this case",
    "typically the decay time is finite in the thermodynamic limit  @xcite , and reflects the presence of dynamical slow modes related to the particle - number conservation  @xcite , which also exist in non - equilibrium systems ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "our exact analytical findings are complemented by a numerical study based on a matrix - product - operator representation of the density matrix  @xcite , one of the techniques for open quantum systems which are recently attracting an increasing attention  @xcite .",
    "these methods are employed to test the robustness of these setups to perturbations , which is thoroughly discussed .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : i ] we review the key facts behind the idea of dissipative state preparation using the dark states of a many body problem , and exemplify them recalling the problem studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . a simple criterion for signalling the divergence of the decay - time with the system size",
    "is also introduced . in sec .",
    "[ sec : n:1 ] we present the exact analytical study of the single - wire protocol , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics1 ] a numerical analysis complements the previous discussion with the characterization of the robustness to perturbations of these setups . in sec .",
    "[ sec : n:2 ] we discuss the protocol based on the ladder geometry . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the dissipative dynamics considered in this article is markovian and , in the absence of a coherent part , can be cast in the following lindblad form : @xmath0 =    \\sum_{j=1}^{m } \\left [ \\hat l_j \\hat \\rho \\hat l_j^\\dagger - \\frac 12 \\ { \\hat l_j^\\dagger \\hat l_j , \\hat \\rho \\ } \\right ] ,    \\label{eq : master : equation}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the so - called lindbladian super - operator and the @xmath2 are the ( local ) lindblad operators .",
    "we now discuss a fact which will be extensively used in the following .",
    "let us assume that a pure state @xmath3 exists , with the property : @xmath4 a simple inspection of eq",
    ".   shows that @xmath3 is a steady state of the dynamics , and it is usually referred to as _",
    "dark state_. although the existence of a state satisfying eq .",
    "is usually not guaranteed , in this article we will mainly consider master equations which enjoy this property .",
    "a remarkable feature of dark states is that they can be searched through the minimization of a _",
    "parent hamiltonian_. let us first observe that eq",
    ".   implies that @xmath5 and since every operator @xmath6 is positive semi - definite , @xmath3 minimizes it .",
    "consequently , @xmath3 is a ground state of the parent hamiltonian : @xmath7 conversely , every zero - energy ground state @xmath8 of hamiltonian   is a steady state of the dynamics  .",
    "indeed , @xmath9 implies that @xmath10 for all @xmath11 .",
    "the last relation means that the norm of the states @xmath12 is zero , and thus that the states themselves are zero : @xmath13 .",
    "as we have already shown , this is sufficient to imply that @xmath8 is a steady - state of the dynamics .    in order to quantify the typical time - scale of the convergence to the steady state ,",
    "it is customary to consider the right eigenvalues of the super - operator @xmath1 , which are defined through the secular equation @xmath14 = \\lambda \\hat \\theta_{\\lambda}$ ] .",
    "the asymptotic decay rate for a finite system is defined as @xmath15 the minus sign in the previous equation follows from the fact that the real part of the eigenvalues of a lindbladian super - operator satisfy the following inequality : @xmath16 .",
    "remarkably , for every eigenvalue @xmath17 of @xmath18 there is an eigenvalue @xmath19 of @xmath1 which is at least two - fold degenerate .",
    "indeed , given the state @xmath20 such that @xmath21 , the operators made up of the dark state @xmath3 and of @xmath20 @xmath22 satisfy the appropriate secular equation .",
    "this has an important consequence : if @xmath18 is gapless , then @xmath23 in the thermodynamic limit , where @xmath24 is the size of the system .",
    "indeed : @xmath25 for every eigenvalue @xmath17 of @xmath18 ; if @xmath17 closes as @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , then the dissipative gap closes at least polynomially in the system size .",
    "note that this argument also implies that if @xmath1 is gapped , then the parent hamiltonian is gapped as well .",
    "it is important to stress that the spectral properties of the parent hamiltonian @xmath18 do not contain all the information concerning the long - time dissipative dynamics . as an example , let us assume that the markovian dynamics in eq .",
    "( i ) supports at least one dark state and ( ii ) has an associated parent hamiltonian which is gapped .",
    "if the lindblad operators are hermitian , then the fully - mixed state is a steady state of the master equation too .",
    "the presence of such stationary state is not signaled by the parent hamiltonian , which is gapped and only detects the pure steady states of the dynamics .    whereas the some of the above relations have been often pointed out in the literature  @xcite , to the best of our knowledge the remarks on the relation between the spectral properties of @xmath1 and @xmath18 are original .",
    "let us now briefly review the results in ref .",
    "@xcite and use them to exemplify how property   can be used as a guideline for dissipative state preparation in the number non - conserving case",
    ". this will be valuable for our detailed studies of its number conserving variant below .",
    "the simplest model displaying zero - energy unpaired majorana modes is the one - dimensional kitaev model at the so - called `` sweet point ''  @xcite : @xmath28 ,    \\quad j>0,\\ ] ] where the fermionic operators @xmath29 satisfy canonical anticommutation relations and describe the annihilation ( creation ) of a spinless fermion at site @xmath30 .",
    "the model can be solved with the bogoliubov - de - gennes transformation , and , when considered on a chain of length @xmath24 with open boundaries , it takes the form : @xmath31 with @xmath32    the ground state has energy @xmath33 and is two - fold degenerate : there are two linearly independent states @xmath34 and @xmath35 which satisfy : @xmath36 the quantum number distinguishing the two states is the parity of the number of fermions , @xmath37 , which is a symmetry of the model ( the subscripts @xmath38 and @xmath39 stand for _ even _ and _ odd _ ) .",
    "both states @xmath40 are p - wave superconductors , as it can be explicitly proven by computing the expectation value of the corresponding order parameter : @xmath41    it is thus relevant to develop a master equation which features @xmath34 and @xmath35 as steady states of the dynamics  @xcite .",
    "property   provides the catch : upon identification of the @xmath42 operators with the lindblad operators of a markovian dynamics , eq .",
    "ensures that the states @xmath43 are steady states of the dynamics and that in the long - time limit the system evolves into a subspace described in terms of p - wave superconducting states .",
    "this becomes particularly clear once it is noticed that the parent hamiltonian of this markov process coincides with @xmath44 in eq .",
    "apart from an additive constant .",
    "let us conclude mentioning that the obtained dynamics satisfies an important physical requirement , namely _",
    "locality_. the lindblad operators @xmath42 only act on two neighboring fermionic modes ; this fact makes the dynamics both physical and experimentally feasible . on the other hand",
    ", they do not conserve the number of particles , thus making their engineering quite challenging with cold - atom experiments .",
    "the goal of this article is to provide dissipative schemes with lindblad operators which commute with the number operator and feature the typical properties of a p - wave superconductor .",
    "the simplest way to generalize the previous results to systems where the number of particles is conserved is to consider the master equation induced by the lindblad operators  @xcite : @xmath45 for a chain with hard - wall boundaries and spinless fermions : @xmath46 = \\gamma    \\sum_{j=1}^{l-1 } \\left [ \\hat l_j ' \\hat \\rho \\hat l_j'^\\dagger - \\frac 12 \\ { \\hat l_j'^\\dagger \\hat l'_j , \\hat \\rho \\ } \\right ] ;    \\quad \\gamma > 0 ;    \\label{eq : master : equation : n:1}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the damping rate .",
    "this markovian dynamics has already been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite . using the results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the parent hamiltonian related to the dynamics in eq .   is considered , it is possible to conclude that for a chain with periodic boundary conditions ( i ) there is a unique dark state for every particle number density @xmath48 , and ( ii ) this state is a p - wave superconductor .",
    "a remarkable point is that the @xmath49 are local and do not change the number of particles : their experimental engineering is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "here we clarify that for the master equation for a single wire with hard - wall boundaries , the steady state is not topological and does not feature majorana edge physics , although they still display the bulk properties of a p - wave superconductor ( instead , the two - wire version studied below _ has _",
    "topological properties associated to dissipative majorana zero modes )",
    ". the asymptotic decay rate of the master equation is also characterized .",
    "an extensive numerical study of the stability of this protocol is postponed to sec .",

    "to characterize the stationary states of the dynamics , let us first observe that eq",

    "let us define the states @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the projector onto the subspace of the global hilbert ( fock ) space with @xmath54 fermions ( @xmath55 when the parity of @xmath54 differs from @xmath56 and thus we avoid the redundant notation @xmath57 ) .",

    "let us show that there is only one dark state @xmath62 once the value of @xmath54 is fixed . to this end",
    ", we consider the parent hamiltonian   associated to the lindblad operators  : @xmath63 \\ ! , \\;\\ ] ] where @xmath64 and @xmath65 is a typical energy scale setting the units of measurement . upon application of the jordan - wigner transformation ,",
    "the model @xmath66 is unitarily equivalent to the following spin-@xmath67 chain model : @xmath68 , \\ ] ] where @xmath69 are pauli matrices .",
    "apart from a constant proportional to @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the ferromagnetic heisenberg model .",
    "the particle - number conservation corresponds to the conservation of the total magnetization along the @xmath72 direction .",
    "it is a well - known fact that this model has a highly degenerate ground state but that there is only one ground state for each magnetization sector , both for finite and infinite lattices .",
    "thus , this state corresponds to the state @xmath62 identified above ; therefore , the possibility that the ground state of @xmath66 is two - fold degenerate ( as would be required for the existence of majorana modes ) for fixed number of fermions and hard - wall boundary conditions is ruled out .",
    "summarizing , the dynamics induced by the lindblad operators in   conserves the number of particles and drives the system into a quantum state with the properties of a p - wave superconductor ( in the thermodynamic limit @xmath34 and @xmath73 have the same bulk properties , as it is explicitly checked in ref .",
    "@xcite , but see also the discussion below ) .",
    "since the steady states of the system for open boundary conditions are unique , they do not display any topological edge property .",
    "let us explicitly check that the states @xmath62 have the properties of a p - wave superconductor .",
    "since each state has a definite number of fermions , the order parameter defined in eq .",
    "is zero by symmetry arguments . in a number - conserving setting ,",
    "we thus rely on the p - wave pairing correlations : @xmath74 if in the long - distance limit , @xmath75 , the expectation value saturates to a finite value or shows a power - law behavior , the system displays p - wave superconducting ( quasi-)long - range order . if the decay is faster , e.g. exponential , the system is disordered .    in this specific case ,",
    "the explicit calculation shows a saturation at large distance ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath76 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the saturation to a finite value captures the p - wave superconducting nature of the states .",
    "note that the breaking of a continuous symmetry in a one - dimensional system signaled by eq .   is a non - generic feature",
    ": a perturbation of hamiltonian @xmath66 would turn that relation into a power - law decay to zero as a function of @xmath77 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an explicit example ) .      an interesting feature of @xmath78 is that it is gapless ; the gap closes as @xmath79 due to the fact that the low - energy excitations have energy - momentum relation @xmath80 , as follows from well - known properties of the ferromagnetic heisenberg model .",
    "the jordan - wigner transformation conserves the spectral properties and thus @xmath81 is also gapless .",
    "thus , according to the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : i : a ] , the asymptotic decay rate @xmath82 associated to the lindbladian @xmath83 closes in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is true both for periodic and hard - wall boundary conditions .",
    "this fact has two important consequences .",
    "the first is that the dissipative preparation of a fixed - number p - wave superconductor through this method requires at least a typical time @xmath84 that scales like @xmath85 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics1 ] we numerically confirm this polynomial scaling .",
    "although this requires an effort which is polynomial in the system size , and which is thus efficient , it is a slower dynamical scenario than that of the non - number - conserving dynamics considered in refs .",
    "@xcite and summarized in sec .  [ sec : i : b ] , where @xmath86 does not scale with @xmath24 ( the super - operator @xmath1 in that case is gapped ) , and thus the approach to stationarity is exponential in time . the difference can be traced to the presence of dynamical slow modes related to exact particle number conservation , a property which is abandoned in the mean field approximation of refs",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "the second consequence is that a gapless lindbladian @xmath1 does not ensure an _ a priori _ stability of the dissipative quantum state preparation . roughly speaking",
    ", even a small perturbation @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) to the lindbladian @xmath83 such that the dynamics is ruled by @xmath89 has the potential to qualitatively change the physics of the steady - state ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for some examples where the presence of a gap is exploited for a perturbative analysis of the steady states ) .",
    "this concerns , in particular , the long - distance behavior of correlation functions . to further understand this last point , in sec .",

    "although the previous analysis , based on the study of the dark states of the dynamics , has already identified many distinguishing properties of the system , there are several features which lie outside its prediction range .",
    "let us list for instance the exact size scaling of the asymptotic decay rate or the resilience of the scheme to perturbations . in order to complement the analysis of the dissipative dynamics with these data , we now rely on a numerical approach .",
    "the numerical analysis that we are going to present is restricted to systems with hard - wall boundary conditions . in order to characterize the time evolution described by the master equation  , we use two different numerical methods .",
    "the first is a runge - kutta ( rk ) integration for systems of small size ( up to @xmath102 )  @xcite .",
    "this method entails an error due to inaccuracies in the numerical integration , but the density matrix is represented without any approximation .    on the contrary ,",
    "the second method , based on a matrix - product - density - operator ( mpdo ) representation of the density matrix , allows the study of longer systems through an efficient approximation of @xmath103  @xcite .",

    "although this method has been shown to be able to reliably describe problems with up to @xmath105 sites  @xcite , in this case we are not able to consider lengths beyond @xmath106 because of the highly - entangled structure of the states encountered during the dynamics .",
    "it is an interesting perspective to investigate whether algorithms based on an mpdo representation of the density matrix , which compute the steady state through maximization of the lindbladian super - operator @xmath83 , might prove more fruitful in this context  @xcite .",
