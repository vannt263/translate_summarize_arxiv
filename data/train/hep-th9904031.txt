    "the asymptotically free property of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has been widely applied to analyze the scaling behaviors of high energy processes and attracted much attention to investigate the qcd renormalization@xmath0 .",
    "this property was at first discovered in refs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) from studying the one - loop renormalization and the solution of renormalization group equation ( rge)@xmath1satisfied by the coupling constant .",
    "the anomalous dimension ( or the @xmath2-function ) appearing in the equation was computed from the renormalization constants which are ordinarily given by mass - independent subtractions such as the minimal subtraction ( ms)@xmath3 , the modified minimal subtraction@xmath4and the momentum space subtraction(mom)@xmath5",
    ". however , there appears a serious ambiguity problem@xmath6 that different subtraction schemes give different results for a renormalized quantity in a finite order perturbative calculation . in the @xmath7 schemes which is carried out in the dimensional regularization procedure , only the divergent terms proportional to the factor @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 ) are subtracted .",
    "the @xmath7 scheme was demonstrated to give the perturbative expansion in the coupling constant for a physical quantity which is of worse convergence . to improve the convergence ,",
    "the @xmath10 scheme was proposed to subtract the divergent part of a feynman diagram which contains the factor @xmath11 where the unphysical terms @xmath12 arise from a special way of analytical continuation of the dimension from n to 4@xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath10 schemes are simple and respect the ward identity , but considered to be nonphysical@xmath5 . in the mom scheme , the divergence in a feynman integral is subtracted at an euclidean momentum , @xmath14 .",
    "this subtraction was viewed as physical and shown to give the perturbative series of better convergence .",
    "nevertheless , the renormalization constants obtained in this scheme do not automatically satisfy the ward identity . to solve the ambiguity problem ,",
    "several prescriptions were proposed in the past@xmath15 in our preceding paper on the qed renormalization@xmath16 , we treated the ambiguity problem from a different angle .",
    "it was argued that a subtraction scheme must respect necessary physical and mathematical principles shcu as the gauge - symmetry ( the ward identity ) , the lorentz - invariance ( the energy - momentum conservation ) and the mathematical convergence .",
    "in addition , it was proved that the solution of the renormalization group equation ( rge ) for a renormalized quantity ( for example , a wave function , a propagator or a vertex ) can be uniquely determined by applying the renormalization boudary condition without any ambiguity . as a result",
    ", an exact s - matrix element can be expressed in the form as given in the tree - diagram approximation except that the coupling constant , the fermion mass and the gauge parameter become effective ( running ) ones .",
    "therefore the tesk of renormalization is reduced to find these effective quantities .    in the mass - independent subtractions",
    "mentioned before , the fermion mass is set to be zero , or say , only the massless fermion propagator @xmath17 is used in the calculation of divergent feynman diagrams .",
    "the rationality of the mass - independent subtraction was argued as follows@xmath18 . in the conventional perturbation series which is expanded in coupling constant",
    ", the massive fermion propagator can be expanded as such a series    @xmath19    substitution of this series into the coventional perturbation series leads to a new perturbation series in which the fermion propagator becomes massless and the fermion mass , like the coupling constant , can be treated as another expansion parameter . working with this kind of perturbation series",
    ", one may perform the mass - independent subtraction .",
    "it is obvious that in order to obtain a quantity which is of a certain order of coupling constant in the sense of the conventional perturbation theory , according to eq.(1.1 ) , one has to compute an infinite set of perturbative terms in the new perturbation theory . in the large momentum limit",
    ", the massive propagator is reduced to the massless one . in this case , there will be no difference between the both perturbation theories mentioned above .",
    "however , for a process whose energy is not too high , particularly , in the energy region near the meson production threshold , the mass in the fermion propagator can not be negligible . in this case , to see the effect of fermion mass on the renormalization , it is convenient to carry out a mass - dependent renormalization in the framework of the conventional perturbation theory as was done in the previous literature@xmath20 . obviously , the mom scheme is suitable for this kind of renormalization . in ref.(3 ) , the subtraction was carried out at an arbitrary euclidean point , @xmath14 and in the landau gauge . while , in ref.(10 ) , the renormalization was done at an off mass shell point , @xmath21 and in the feynman gauge . both of the subtractions give the same one - loop anomalous dimension of the coupling constant , but different anomalous dimensions of the quark mass .    in this paper",
    ", we wish to restudy the qcd mass - dependent renormalization in the mom  scheme along the line as described in our preceding paper .",
    "the new features of this study are : ( 1 ) the subtraction exactly respects necessary physical and mathematical principles . owing to the restriction of these principles , the renormalization will be put on the faithful basis and have no ambiguity .",
    "for example , by the convergence principle , we are not allowed to employ the divergent form of renormalization constants to do a meaningful calculation because a divergent quantity is not well - defined mathematically and therefore can not be unambiguously evaluated by any computational rule .",
    "the correct procedure of computing the anomalous dimension in a rge is usage of regularized froms of the renormalization constants . by this procedure ,",
    "a renormalized quantity given by solving its rge will be uniquely determined by its anomalous dimension and boundary condition ; ( 2 ) the renormalization point is taken to be a time - like ( minkowski ) momentum .",
    "the subtraction with this renormalization point will be called generalized mass - shell scheme(gms ) because this scheme can naturally lead to the results given in the mass - shell subtraction scheme .",
    "it will be shown that the behavior of a renormalized quantity derived in the gms scheme is different from the ones obtained in other subtraction schemes ; ( 3 ) the qcd one - loop effective coupling constant and effective quark masses derived in the gms scheme and in general gauges are given rigorous and explicit expressions .",
    "these expressions will go over to the results given in the ms scheme in the large momentum limit .",
    "the remainder of this paper is arranged as follows . in sect.2",
    ", we will describe the derivation of the renormalization constant of coupling constant .",
    "this renormalization constant is chosen to be determined by the renormalization constants of the gluon propagator , the ghost particle propagator and the ghost vertices .",
    "the renormalization constant of gluon propagator is given based on the ward identity .",
    "it will be shown that the other two renormalization constants for the ghost particle propagator and the ghost vertex will give their anomalous dimensions which are renormalization - scheme - independent . in sect.3",
    ", we will derive an explicit expression of the effective coupling constant by solving its rge and show its asymptotic behavior .",
    "in sect.4 , we will give a derivation of the ward identity satisfied by the quark - gluon vertex and prove that in the approximation of order @xmath22 , this identity is reduced to the form as found in qed and thus the subtraction version of the quark self - energy is similar to that for the electron self - energy . in sect.5 , an explicit expression of effective quark masses will be given by solving its rge .",
    "we will end this paper with some comments and discussions .",
    "the renormalization constant of coupling constant @xmath23 is defined by @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the renormalized and unrenormalized coupling constants respectively . according to the ward identity@xmath27",
    ", the @xmath23 can be expressed in different ways . in this section ,",
    "we prefer to use the following expression @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the renormalization constants for the gluon propagator , the ghost particle propagator and ghost vertex respectively . in the following",
    ", we will describe how they are determined by the subtractions of the gluon self - energy , the ghost particle self - energy and the ghost vertex correction in the gms scheme .",
    "the one - loop diagrams for the gluon self - energy , the ghost particle self - energy and the ghost vertex correction have already been calculated in the literature@xmath31 by the dimensional regularization .",
    "so , we may directly quote the results and put some emphases on essential points of the subtraction procedure in the gms scheme .",

    "( 1 ) the results given in eqs.(3.4 ) and ( 3.5 ) are exactly identical to those obtained in the ms scheme .",

    "so , the @xmath76 and @xmath81 given above are scheme - independent .",
    "this is why we like to choose the ghost particle self - energy and the ghost vertex to define the renormalization constant @xmath23 .",
    "as for the @xmath82 , it is noted that the term related to the @xmath83 in eq.(2.6 ) which is finite in the limit@xmath54 gives no contribution to the anomalous dimension owing to its independence of the fermion mass . when the quark mass is set to be zero , the result in eq.(3.3 )",

    "however , in the region of @xmath87 near zero , as pointed out in sect.3 , the qcd perturbative results are no longer valid .",
    "in this paper , the qcd one - loop renormalization has been restudied in the gms scheme .",
    "it was shown that the gms scheme allows us not only to consider the mass effect on the renormalization , but also to directly relate the renormalization scale @xmath70 to the momentum p. the effective coupling constant and the effective quark masses obtained in this scheme get a noteworthy improvement near the heavy quark threshold in comparison with those given previously in the ms scheme .",
    "the effective coupling constant and the effective quark mass presented in the ms scheme now appear as approximate results given in the large momentum limit .",
    "it is noted here that even in this limit , the effective coupling constant and the effective mass can only have unique forms .",
    "it is impossible to result in a difference between the @xmath7 and @xmath10 schemes@xmath215 because an effective quantity should be the solution of its rge whose form is uniquely determined by the anomalous dimension and the boundary condition . as emphasized before ,",
    "the correct procedure of evaluating the anomalous dimension is the use of the regularized renormalization constant and the limit @xmath216 should be taken after differentiation with respect to the renormalization point . by this procedure",
    ", the factor @xmath217 appearing in the n - dimensional feynman integrals can only come to unity .",
    "it is not possible to yield the unphysical terms @xmath12 in a renormalized quantity .    in this paper , the effective coupling constant given in the one - loop approximation",
    "is calculated by employing the renormalization constants given by the subtractions of the gluon and ghost particle self - energies and the ghost vertex correction .",
    "it is emphasized that the renormalization constant @xmath218 is obtained on the basis of the ward identity obeyed by the gluon self - energy and therefore is faithful .",
    "the renormalization constants @xmath30 and @xmath46 derived respectively from the subtractions of the ghost vertex correction and the ghost particle self - energy , as mentioned in sect.4 , give the anomalous dimensions which are scheme - independent due to that there is no quark mass to appear in the vertex and the self - energy .",
    "therefore , the anomalous dimension @xmath91 computed from these renormalization constants is definite , no any uncertainty .",
    "particularly , the correctness of the anomalous dimension shown in eqs.(3.6)-(3.8 ) is confirmed by the previous result presented in refs.(9 ) and ( 16 ) where the @xmath91 was determined by the subtraction of the quark and gluon self - energies and the quark - gluon vertex at a space - like point .",
    "the expression of the @xmath2-function given in the space - like point is @xmath20@xmath219\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "the above expression may be directly written out from eqs.(3.6)- ( 3.8 ) by the transformation @xmath222 , corresponding to @xmath223 .",
    "the effective coupling constant given by the @xmath2-function in eq.(6.1 ) still exhibits the property of asymptotic freedom when @xmath224 ; but , it has a landau singularity in the region of large distance , different from the result given in the gms scheme . in fig.(2 ) , the landau singularity occurs at @xmath225 .",
    "it is stressed again that the effective quark masses shown in sect.5 are obtained based on the subtraction written in eq.(4.31 ) which is derived from the ward identity respected by the quark one - loop self - energy .",
    "these effective masses are different from those given in the previous works@xmath226 .",
    "for example , in ref.(3 ) , the mass anomalous dimensions derived in the landau gauge is of the form @xmath227\\ ] ] which is manifestly different from that formulated in eqs.(5.8 ) and ( 5.10 ) .",
    "the result shown above , actually , was obtained from another subtraction .",
    "if we start from the expression for the quark self - energy@xmath228 @xmath229 and subtract at the space - like point @xmath230 , the quark propagator and mass renormalization constants will be defined by @xmath231 and @xmath232\\ ] ] in the approximation of order @xmath22 for the one - loop diagram , the constant @xmath233 defined in eq.(6.5 ) will give rise to the result in eq.(6.2 ) .",
    "since the subtraction above is not compatible with the ward identity , the effective quark masses obtained in this subtraction can not be viewed as reasonable results .",
    "the correct result of the effective quark mass given by the subtraction at space - like may be obtained from eqs.(5.11)-(5.15 ) through the transformation @xmath234 . in this case , as we see , the effective mass becomes complex .",
    "if we require the effective mass to be real , the subtraction at space - like point should be excluded .",
    "however , this does not mean that the space - like momentum subtraction is useless .",
    "the subtractions at time - like point and at space - like point probably suit to different processes in which the interactions are of different behaviors . for example , for the t- channel fermion - antifermion scattering ,",
    "the momentum on the intermediate boson line is space - like ; while , for the s - channel scattering , the corresponding momentum is time - like .",
    "it seems that the boson self - energy should be subtracted at the space - like point for the former process and at time - like point for the latter process .",
    "this problem is , we think , worthy to pursue in future investigations .",
    "the authors would like to thank professor shi - shu wu for useful discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by national natural science foundation of china .",
