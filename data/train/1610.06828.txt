    "spatial dispersion effects in elastic light interaction with 3d periodic structures result in various phenomena unusual to isotropic media , and strongly influence propagation of surface waves @xcite .",
    "currently manifestations of the spatial dispersion are well - known both for natural crystals @xcite and artificial periodic structures being either photonic crystals or metamaterials @xcite .",
    "nonlocality in natural crystals is weak at optical wavelengths , and results in directional variations of mode propagation constant at scales of about @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , consideration of such deviations unmasks existence of seven optical axes in cubic crystals .",
    "this effect called spatial - dispersion - induced birefringence , was already known by lorentz @xcite , and nowadays is taken into account by manufacturers of projection systems for deep ultraviolet lithography set - ups @xcite .    on the other hand , nonlocality in artificial photonic structures ",
    "photonic crystals and metamaterials  is much more prominent @xcite and draws a lot of attention due to promising applications .",
    "strong spatial dispersion in photonic crystals results in superprism effect , possibility for perfect imaging , and generally provides advanced potential for spatial filtering and beam manipulation @xcite .",
    "interpretation of phenomena related to spatial dispersion appears to be handy with representation by isofrequency contours and surfaces @xcite . for certain classes of metamaterials isofrequency contours",
    "were demonstrated to be dramatically distorted in comparison with those of natural crystals highly depending on structure parameters @xcite .",
    "spatial - dispersion - induced birefringence being small for natural materials appeared to have prominent values for metamaterials with resonant metallic inclusions @xcite .",
    "authors of @xcite demonstrated a theoretical possibility to stop the light in metamaterial waveguide coming from an interplay between the spatial dispersion and anisotropy .",
    "an intermediate position between weak spatial dispersion in natural crystals and prominent effects in photonic crystals and metamaterials can be filled with low refractive index periodic dielectric structures of period - to - wavelength ratio of the order of @xmath1 , so that no diffraction occurs .",
    "paper @xcite provided an evidence that such composites can exhibit quite unusual optical properties by demonstrating 2d periodically patterned waveguide to manifest trirefringence .",
    "current technology level of the direct laser writing technique allows fabricating even 3d periodic high - quality dielectric composites with periods as small as tenths of a micron for operating at mid - infrared and telecom wavelengths @xcite . to estimate an order of magnitude of spatial dispersion effects in such structures consider permittivity decomposition under assumption that structure is non - gyrotropic : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is wavevector .",
    "the second term scales as @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 being characteristic period of a composite and the wavelength respectively @xcite .",
    "for structures of interest set @xmath7 , which yields @xmath8 .",
    "taking into account that optical anisotropy in such structures in the limit of infinitely small period amounts to @xmath9 for low index dielectrics and to @xmath10 for high index dielectrics @xcite , it becomes clear , that spatial dispersion terms can be concurrent with anisotropy of the first term @xmath11 , which may lead to interesting effects for low refractive index contrast composites operating away from resonances .",
    "in order to investigate spatial dispersion in the described parameter range we utilized a variation of the plane wave expansion method for first principle simulation of photonic structures @xcite . by using such first principle approach , from the one hand , we avoid restricting ourselves by decomposition of eq .",
    "( [ eq : one ] ) and consequent loss of accuracy due limited applicability of eq .",

    "( [ eq : one ] ) . in the current research",
    "we use the electric field formulation , which is based on the volume integral equation solution of the maxwell s equations : @xmath12 here @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is some constant , and @xmath15 is the permeability of vacuum ) , @xmath16 enumerate cartesian axes , @xmath17 is the kronecker symbol , and the multiplier before source @xmath18 is the free space dyadic green function .",

    "it writes @xmath21 here vector index @xmath22 enumerates fourier harmonics , possible @xmath23 component values are @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are periods of the composite structure along coordinate axes .",
    "notation for wavevectors here is different from eq .",

    "eigen modes in a given 3d periodic composite come from the resonant analysis of eq .",
    "( 3 ) via an efficient complex pole search algorithm @xcite .",
    "special precautions were taken to control simulation accuracy at each step of the algorithm , as we are interested in effects which can occur for relatively small effective refractive index contrasts starting from values of about @xmath27 . to satisfy this requirement we first set a sufficiently low convergence criterion for the generalized minimal residual method for solution of the linear equation system ( [ eq : three ] ) , and , second ,",
    "apply the second order richardson extrapolation to improve calculated propagation constants and harmonic field amplitudes for subsequent numbers of fourier harmonics used in simulations .",
    "this allowed obtaining mode propagation constants with 5 - 7 significant digit precision .",
    "in what follows we provide three illustrative examples of spatial dispersion manifestation . first example concerns the above mentioned existence of seven optical axes in cubic crystals , and aims at quantitatively estimating an impact of the second and higher order terms in eq .",

    "to conclude , our work reveals existence of nontrivial spatial dispersion effects in low refractive index contrast 3d periodic dielectric composites operating in the effective medium regime . for sufficiently large period values artificial crystals possessing uniaxial and biaxial properties in the limit of infinitely small periods",
    "are demonstrated to have @xmath108 and @xmath109 optical axes respectively .",
    "in addition , quantitative values of effective parameters of composites retrieved from results of first - principle simulations yield a tendency for the spatial dispersion to compensate anisotropy in certain directions .",
    "these effects can be regarded as strong in a sense that spatial dispersion terms have the same order of magnitude as anisotropy in the considered structures .    presented retrieval of @xmath40 values is a kind of a numerical homogenization procedure with determined range of validity .",
