    "the quasiparticle self - consistent @xmath0 ( ) method is the best available method for finding a static one - body hamiltonian @xmath4 that describes a system on the basis of the optimum independent - particle [ or the quasiparticle ( qp ) ] picture @xcite .  considers for an optimum division of the full many - body hamiltonian @xmath5 into @xmath6 , by choosing @xmath4 so as to minimize the perturbative corrections caused by @xmath7 to the qps described by @xmath4 .",
    "that is , we perform a self - consistent calculation until the correction is minimized .",
    "note that @xmath7 should contain not only a bare coulomb interaction but also a quadratic term , which is missing in usual model hamiltonians . in the  methodm",
    ", we evaluate @xmath7 in the @xmath0 approximation ; therefore , in the determination of @xmath4 , charge fluctuations ( not only local fluctuations but also plasmons ) are taken into account self - consistently within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "we determine @xmath4 , the self - energy @xmath8 , and the effective screened coulomb interaction @xmath9 simultaneously when we attain self - consistency in .",
    "kotani and his collaborators developed an all - electron @xmath0  method based on the full - potential linear muffin - tin orbital ( fplmto ) method @xcite to perform  calculations @xcite .",
    "we call this method fplmto- .",
    "fplmto-  was applied to a wide range of materials and proved its potential to go beyond the abilities of current first - principles methods based on the density functional theory .",
    "however , mainly because of the difficulty in the usage of fplmto , it is too complicated to apply fplmto-  to a wide variety of materials .",
    "the main reason for this is that fplmto uses only atom - centered localized orbitals , muffin - tin orbitals ( mtos ) , as a basis set to expand eigenfunctions .",
    "choosing parameters specifying mtos is not straightforward and requires fine tunings and repeated tests to perform reliable calculations .",
    "in addition , the offset-@xmath10 method for the brillouin zone ( bz ) integration is slightly problematic in treating anisotropic systems .    to avoid these problems , kotani and coworkers have developed a new method of implementing the  method based on the linearized augmented plane - wave and muffin - tin orbital method ( pmt method ) , which employs augmented plane wave ( apw ) and mto basis sets @xcite .",
    "the pmt method is a unique mixed basis method that uses two types of augmented waves @xcite .",
    "we call this new implementation of  as pmt-  and the package is open for public use as the ecalj package , which is available at https://github.com/tkotani/ecalj/ @xcite . in this paper , we present practical applications of pmt-   with the ecalj package to a variety of materials .",
    "the present calculation results have not been presented yet , although pmt-  with the ecalj package was already used in the preceding studies @xcite and the minimum examination of pmt-  was reported in ref .",
    ".[tab : mat ] crystal structures used for the calculations in this paper and the number of @xmath11 points for the self - energy calculations in the 1st brillouin zone ( see text ) .",
    "labels mean as follows : cod : i d number of the crystal open database @xcite , dia : diamond structure , hex : hexagonal structure , zb : zincblende structure , wz : wurtzite structure , rs : rocksalt structure , cub : cubic structure , mono : monoclinic structure , tetra : tetragonal structure , pero : perovskite structure . [ cols= \" < , < ,",
    "< , < \" , ]      we sometimes need quasi - particle energies at specific @xmath12 points in bz , for example , when we observe optical responses , which contain both direct and indirect transitions , or when we need to consider intervalley transitions . here",
    ", we show the eigenvalues instead of band plots ( see appendix about how to show band plots ) .    in table",
    "[ tab : bandprop ] , we show the eigenvalues , which can be interpreted as quasi - particle energies , at the @xmath13 , and @xmath14 points for five selected zb materials . these values can be compared with those calculated in the hybrid functional hse06 @xcite .",
    "we can consider that 80+so shows good agreement with experiments .",
    "however , we also see its limitations of accuracy .",
    "for example , @xmath15 and @xmath16 for inp by 80+so are 2.18 and 1.34 ev , respectively .",
    "they are slightly different from the experimental values of 2.01 ( @xmath15 ) and 1.42 ( @xmath16 ) ev . the difference is slightly larger than the agreement of the band gap itself [ 1.34 ev ( 80+so ) and 1.42 ev ( experiment ) at the @xmath10 point ] .",
    "thus , care should be taken about this level of error when we apply 80+so to materials . however , we simultaneously need to note the accuracy of experimental data shown in table  [ tab : bandprop ] .",
    "these data are mostly estimated by optical experiments , where we need to remove excitonic effects theoretically from the raw experimental data based on some simple assumptions .",
    "therefore , the difference between 80+so and hse06 could be within the experimental error range .",
    "hse06 values , taken from ref .",
    "40 , also give good agreement with experimental values .",
    "hse06 uses gga , but corrects a short - range exchange part with the hartree - fock exchange term .",
    "since the hartree - fock method can give very large band gaps , results can be strongly affected by the hybridization ratio .",
    "this is in contrast to 80 where we only hybridized 20% of lda so as to correct the small error of .",
    "one interesting observation is that hse06 and 80+so give similar tendencies as for differences from experimental values .",
    "for example , the valence band width @xmath17 values of inp are -2.49 and -2.52 ev for 80+so and hse06 , respectively .",
    "effective mass plays a key role in the evaluation of transport properties and eigenvalues in quantum well structures and so on .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate the effective mass in  in the ecalj package since we have interpolation procedure in the entire bz ; namely , without any extra techniques such as wannier interpolation , we can plot the band structure .",
    "we show the calculated effective mass along the [ 100 ] direction for zb in table  [ tab : effmass ] ( the effective masses along other directions are complicated @xcite ) . as discussed in ref .",
    "40 , the improvement of the prediction of the band - gap energy is essential for the correct prediction of the effective mass .    in fig . [",
    "fig : massgaas ] , we illustrate how to calculate the effective masses for gaas . to obtain effective masses along the [ 100 ] direction",
    ", we first calculate eigenvalues ( quasi - particle energies ) along the [ 100 ] direction on a very dense @xmath12 mesh .",
    "then , for example , in the case of the electron mass @xmath18 , we consider the electron branch at the bottom of the conduction band .",
    "this branch of eigenvalues relative to the eigenvalue at the @xmath10 point can be represented by @xmath19 as a function of the length of @xmath20 .",
    "we now have @xmath19 at dense @xmath20 points along the [ 100 ] direction .",
    "then , we perform a least square fitting for @xmath19 in the energy window between 0.01 and 0.05 ev ( or between -0.01 and -0.05 ev for holes ) .",
    "this range corresponds approximately to room temperature . here",
    ", we use the fitting formula @xmath21 , where the two parameters @xmath22 and @xmath18 ( effective mass ) are determined@xcite .",
    "@xmath22 is a parameter that modifies a parabolic behavior slightly .",
    "we apply the same procedure to other branches corresponding to the heavy hole mass @xmath23 , the light hole mass @xmath24 , and the mass for the split off band , @xmath25 .",
    "the calculated effective mass is summarized in table  [ tab : effmass ] .",
    "as we see in table  [ tab : effmass ] , the agreement of theoretical effective masses with experiments ones is rather satisfactory , especially for the electron mass .",
    "if we like to treat the subband structure of a superlattice such as cds / cdse @xcite , we have to use a method that can reproduce not only the band gap and band offset , but also the effective mass .",
    "this is never expected in methods such as the lda and the constant - shift procedure of the band gap ( scissors operator procedure ) . in this sense",
    ", careful treatment may be necessary to compare experimental data with the results in ref .",
    "we have examined the ability of the  method and the hybrid method 80 implemented in the ecalj package to predict band properties such as band gap energy , eigenvalues at special points , and effective mass .",
    "the ecalj package can be used easily since the parameters for calculation are automatically set . with the hybrid scheme 80",
    ", we can expect that the accuracy of band gaps can be @xmath26 0.1 ev for usual semiconductors .",
    "this level of accuracy is much higher than what we expect in the lda .",
    "considering the fact that  can treat even metals accurately @xcite , we can expect that the  or hybrid method can be applicable to complex systems such as metal / semiconductor interfaces .",
    "however , it is necessary to know its limitations shown in this paper for such applications .",
    "in addition , note that calculations are time - consuming , although we think there is so much room to improve the ecalj package for acceralating the calculations . for typical cases ,",
    "the values of computational time per qsgw iteration by using one node of xeon ( it contains 24 cores , hitachi ha8000-tc / ht210 in kyushu university ) are 2 min for c , 8 min for gaas(zb ) , 25 min for gan(wz ) , 36min for 4h - sic(8 atoms / unitcell ) , and 150 min for hgo(8 atoms / cell ) .",
    "computational time depends not only on the number of atoms per cell and the crystal symmetry but also on the atomic species .",
    "usually , quasi - particle energies are converged within 0.01 ev after approximately five iterations .",
    "this work was partly supported by the advanced low carbon technology research and development program ( alca ) of japan science and technology agency ( jst ) , and by grants - in - aid for scientific research 23104510 and 26286074 .",
    "we also acknowledge the computing time provided by computing system for research in kyushu university .",
    "the ecalj package is open for public use and all of the results presented in this paper can be reproduced by using the ecalj package by yourself . in this appendix ,",
    "the calculation procedure is briefly explained step by step .",
