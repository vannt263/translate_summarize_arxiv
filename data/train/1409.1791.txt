    "asymmetric distributions of satellite galaxies are seemingly common .",
    "@xcite found that all bar one of the known 16 satellites of m31 lie on the hemisphere of the m31 sky facing the milky way galaxy .",
    "the more recent investigation of @xcite using a larger sample has soothed worries that this was an artefact of small sample size or observational bias .",
    "@xcite analyzed the radial velocities of the satellites and argued that 13 of the satellites possess a coherent rotational motion , with 12 of the 13 lying on the side of m31 nearest to the milky way galaxy .    for our galaxy ,",
    "there are also tantalizing hints of a similar asymmetric distributions , though our ` fishbowl ' viewpoint makes such claims hard to evaluate .",
    "plots of the locations of the known milky way satellites in the sky seem to suggest that the northern galactic hemisphere is over - endowed compared to the southern .",
    "most of the northern galactic hemisphere lies on the far side of the milky way as judged from an m31 perspective . in other words , the milky way satellites",
    "are also asymmetrically distributed with a preponderance on the far side from m31 .",
    "what causes such asymmetries in satellite distributions to be set up and how do they maintain themselves ? at first sight , tidal forces suggest themselves as a possibility .",
    "suppose the milky way and m31 have mass @xmath2 and separation @xmath3 in the @xmath4-direction , then the tidal potential in the frame of the host is @xmath5 using a taylor expansion in the limit @xmath6 for a distant perturber , the tidal force is @xmath7 the first term here is @xmath8 . as this calculation",
    "is done in the frame of the host galaxy , this cancels with the acceleration due to the non - inertial frame .",
    "we then have several terms which are linear in @xmath4 and these can not lead to an asymmetry in the satellite population .",
    "the lowest order term that can generate any asymmetry is the @xmath9 term .",
    "the magnitude of this effect for a milky way - m31 pair is roughly @xmath10 kpc , as can be verified by simulations in the center of mass frame of the milky way and m31 .",
    "this is clearly insufficient to explain the asymmetry in the population of m31 satellites .",
    "this leads us to consider the possibility that such asymmetries arise from the initial conditions of infall of satellites .",
    "significant fractions of satellites may be accreted from a similar direction in groups , or in loosely bound associations or clumps and this can lead to asymmetries in the satellite distributions  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "motivated by the example of m31 , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite provide scenarios in which groups of satellite galaxies may be accreted in preferred directions .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that in simulations of the local group , satellite infall is not spherical in nature and that preferred directions are observed .",
    "@xcite show that planar features are not uncommon in cosmological simulations , however the features they describe are transient in nature .",
    "the extent to which such associations and phase space structures can persist over a hubble time without dispersal through phase - mixing is not immediately an obvious .",
    "an observable asymmetry may indicate that an initially clumpy population has not had sufficient time to fully phase mix .",
    "this suggests that we examine the dispersal of such clumps .",
    "the most natural coordinate system in which to do so is action - angles . here",
    ", actions are conserved while angles evolve linearly with time  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath11 let us consider the dispersal of a clump in action - angle space . for our application ,",
    "the clump is composed of a loose association of satellite galaxies , though the theorem we prove holds more generally . as the clump disperses ,",
    "the spread in actions ( which are adiabatic invariants ) is conserved , whilst the spread in angles is @xmath12 so , the dispersal of the clump in time therefore only depends on @xmath13 , the difference in frequencies as actions are changed by a small amount , that is , the hessian matrix multiplied by the difference in actions .",
    "this is similar to the related problem in stream dynamics  ( c.f .",
    "we can compute the hessian for scale - free power - law potentials  @xcite , which take the form : @xmath14 here , @xmath15 is the circular velocity at radius @xmath16 . when @xmath17 , this becomes the isothermal sphere , whilst when",
    "@xmath18 this is of course the kelperian case .",
    "the outer parts of galaxy haloes lie between these two limiting cases .    in a spherical potential ,",
    "there are two actions , namely the radial action @xmath19 and the azimuthal action @xmath20 which may be taken as the angular momentum @xmath21  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the hamiltonian as a function of the actions takes the form  @xcite @xmath22 here , @xmath23 and the constants @xmath24 and @xmath3 are given in williams et al ( 2014 ) .",
    "differentiation gives the angular frequency as @xmath25 one more differentiation gives the components of the hessian @xmath26 where @xmath27 is @xmath3 for @xmath19 and @xmath28 for @xmath20 .",
    "this is a decreasing function of @xmath29 if the power - law models are normalised to the same enclosed mass .",
    "_ so , for a fixed enclosed mass , the closer the potential is to keplerian , the larger the magnitude of the hessian and the faster the dispersal .",
    "_ this is the dispersal theorem",
    ".    we may be interested in the number of orbits @xmath30 it takes for a clump to spread out .",
    "this means we divide out the frequency @xmath31 by the hessian matrix , @xmath32 as @xmath3 increases as a function of @xmath29 , it is straightforward to establish that the complete expression is an increasing function of @xmath29 . in other words ,",
    "the keplerian case is again the most efficient at mixing .",
    "an assumption in these calculations is that the spread in angles dominates the evolution of the clump , whilst the spread in actions is small .",
    "this assumption is likely to hold good for small clumps .",
    "therefore , it is important to test the results against simulations , which we proceed to do in the next section .",
    "to describe the degree of phase mixing as a clump disperses , we use the mean angular separation between galaxies in the association .",
    "this can be computed both analytically and numerically .",
    "we consider phase mixing to be complete when this value reaches @xmath33 .    to start with",
    ", we assume the simplest case of a keplerian galactic host potential . in this potential ,",
    "orbits have periods given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the energy and @xmath2 is the mass of the host galaxy . provided the orbit is not highly eccentric , then the angular phase is @xmath36 the magnitude of the difference in @xmath37 between two such satellites is @xmath38 where @xmath39 . to find the mean , we integrate over phase space co - ordinates after multiplying by a probability distribution .",
    "we model the group of satellites as a ( truncated ) gaussian with dispersions in position and velocity @xmath40 and @xmath41 around means @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xmath44 we thus evaluate numerically @xmath45 truncating our probability distribution at @xmath46 .    , with the keplerian case as the fastest dispersing .",
    "this vindicates the dispersal theorem . ]",
    "1.5 cm      for arbitrary spherical potentials , such as the flat rotation curve or logarithmic case , we must evaluate @xmath47 here , @xmath48 is the azimuthal period , given by @xmath49 , with @xmath50 - l^2/r^2}},\\ ] ] and @xmath51 - l^2/r^2}}.\\ ] ] the validity of these approximations can be tested via direct comparison to numerical simulations .",
    "the simulations involve drawing test particles from a 6-d gaussian centered on the mean position and velocity .",
    "these particles are integrated forwards in time in the host galactic potential , assuming no self - gravity , and their mean angular separation evaluated .",
    "[ fig : numvsana ] shows the time taken in the keplerian and logarithmic cases for the mean @xmath52 to reach @xmath33 , for a range of values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in each case",
    ", the clump is centered on an orbit with @xmath53 kpc and @xmath54 kms@xmath55 , as might be appropriate for the outer parts of a large galaxy like m31 .",
    "the enclosed mass of the host galaxy is @xmath56 , comparable to estimates of the mass of m31  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the analytic approximation reproduces well the shape of the contours , however it slightly underestimates the time taken for a clump to disperse .",
    "the likely sources of the discrepancy are the approximations we have made , particularly the assumption that the angular velocity of the particles is constant in time , allowing us to perform our integrals in terms of the angular period .",
    "further , we modeled our probability distribution as gaussian in the magnitude @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "this requires the implicit assumption that our perturbations about the mean clump velocity are in the direction of motion , and perturbations about the position are radial .",
    "in actuality , we should perform an integral over the 6-d phase space .",
    "however , perturbations to the relevant quantities or @xmath57 and @xmath58 from a six - dimensional gaussian are dominated by the contributions from the radial position terms and the direction of motion velocity terms .    fig .",
    "[ fig : fixapoorbs ] shows , for the same clump mean velocities , the number of orbits required for the mean @xmath59 to reach @xmath33 for a variety of power - law potentials as given in eq  ( [ eq : powlaw ] ) .",
    "this demonstrates that the number of orbital periods needed for dispersal is an increasing function of @xmath29 , as suggested by our calculation in section 2 .",
    "note that the simulations have really pushed beyond the frozen action approximation used there . comparing the keplerian and logarithmic potentials  which are the likely bounding cases for the outer parts of galaxy haloes  an identical clump takes more orbital periods to disperse in the logarithmic halo by a factor of @xmath60 .",
    "one assumption underlying all the work so far is that the disk of satellites lies in a nearly spherical potential .",
    "this is a natural choice , as orbits in spherical potentials lie in a plane .",
    "however , the disk of satellites could lie in the equatorial plane of an axisymmetric potential , or in one of the two stable principal planes of a triaxial potential  @xcite .",
    "we have verified by numerical calculations that the dispersal time and the number of orbits for @xmath59 to reach @xmath33 is close to the spherical case in these instances .",
    "whilst our numerical simulations are simple in nature , they display qualitatively similar results to more complex simulations such as those in @xcite , where local group substructure is shown to persist over long timescales .",
    "in order to apply our results to the expected survival timescales of observed substructure , we desire a simple analytic formula for estimating a lower limit ( keplerian case ) for the time taken for a clump of satellites to disperse . from eq  ( [ eq : norb ] ) , we see that @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the spread in the sum of the actions . using our expression for the hamiltonian",
    ", we can show @xmath63 where @xmath35 is reduced energy . using @xmath64",
    "we fit the functional form for the dispersal time @xmath65 to determine the parameter @xmath66 , we simultaneously fit five different orbits each with a 10x10 grid of @xmath40 between @xmath67 kpc and @xmath41 between @xmath67 kms@xmath55 . the values were calculated analytically using the method described in section 3.1 . the orbital parameters for @xmath42 /kpc , @xmath43 /kms@xmath55 were",
    "@xmath68$],@xmath69$],@xmath70$],@xmath71$],@xmath72 $ ] . using monte carlo methods",
    ", we recover a best fit value of @xmath73 .",
    "the mean absolute fractional error for the fit is @xmath74 , and the maximum is @xmath75 .",
    "the high maximum errors occurred in cases two and three , when @xmath76 kpc and @xmath77 kpc .",
    "this is when we expect our approximations to break down  the taylor expansion for calculating @xmath13 is no longer valid in this regime .",
    "we only expect our formula to be applicable in the case when @xmath78 is much less than unity , ruling out for example the dispersion of structure on highly radial orbits .",
    "one application of this formula is for the dispersal of a clump of satellites falling into m31 .",
    "we take an m31 mass of @xmath79 .",
    "let us assume that an association of dwarfs of total mass of @xmath80 fell into the m31 halo and was the progenitor of @xmath1 dwarf galaxies in the present - day disc of satellites .",
    "note that the total mass in the association is rather modest , as it is smaller by a factor of @xmath1 as compared to nearby associations of dwarf galaxies studied observationally by @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath40 as @xmath81 kpc , which , for a loosely bound clump with potential energy shape factor of @xmath82 , fixes @xmath41 at @xmath81 kms@xmath55 . in order to mimic the properties of the m31 galaxies , we place the association on an orbit with apocenter at @xmath83 kpc and pericentre at @xmath84 kpc .",
    "this gives an apocenter velocity of @xmath85 kms@xmath55 . in these units ,",
    "this orbit has a period of @xmath86 kpckm@xmath55s .",
    "our analytic formula then gives a lower limit of @xmath87 gyr for the clump to disperse .",
    "this is of order the age of the universe , and we would expect this timescale to be roughly 3 times larger in a logarithmic halo .    in other words ,",
    "if an association of @xmath1 dwarfs galaxies was accreted by m31 sometime within the last @xmath87 gyr , then we expect the association to persist rather easily and the present - day distribution would retain memory of the initial conditions .",
    "the satellites would not be fully phase - mixed and would be spread out to lie in an asymmetric disk , much as observed .",
    "another application is to the cold substructure in dwarf spheroidal galaxies , such as andromeda ii and ursa minor .",
    "these are probably the the result of the engulfment of smaller dwarfs and clusters within the larger dwarf spheroidal itself .",
    "the cold stellar stream in @xcite is at a distance of roughly @xmath88 kpc with a dispersion of order @xmath89 kpc .",
    "the velocity dispersion is given as less than @xmath90 kms@xmath55 .",
    "the enclosed mass interior to the stream is @xmath91x@xmath92 .",
    "this gives a circular velocity at @xmath88 kpc of @xmath93 kms@xmath55 .",
    "this orbit has a period of @xmath94 kpc km@xmath55s .",
    "a lower limit to the dispersal timescale for these values is @xmath95 myr . even for a logarithmic halo",
    ", this would suggest that , if there is a detectable angular asymmetry in the substructure , then it is relatively young .",
    "the data at this time certainly indicate that the angular extent of the stream is not a full @xmath33 around andromeda ii , although this may be partly a consequence of the spectroscopic selection function .",
    "the cold clump in ursa minor was discovered by  @xcite , who suggested that it may be a cluster that had fallen into the dwarf galaxy and was in the process of dissolving .",
    "as the velocity offset between the cold clump and ursa minor is small , this suggests that the orbit is either radial or is circular and viewed almost face - on .",
    "@xcite investigated the former possibility and showed that the dissolution timescale depended on the properties of the central parts of the potential . here , we follow the latter possibility , namely that that cold substructure is on a near circular orbit at 150 pc from the center .",
    "the mass enclosed within the orbit is @xmath96 .",
    "the size and the velocity dispersion of the clump are given by @xcite as @xmath97 pc and @xmath98 kms@xmath55 respectively , which gives a phase - mixing timescale of @xmath99 myr .",
    "this is comparable to the disruption timescale in a cusped potential found by @xcite if the clump is on a radial orbit .",
    "note however we have probably pushed our dispersal formula to beyond its formal domain of applicability in studying disruption of such a tightly bound clump .",
    "our main conclusion is a general formula for the timescale for phase - mixing of orbits in nearly spherical potentials .",
    "survival times are always shortest in keplerian potentials and can be @xmath100 3 times longer in logarithmic potentials .",
    "we use the formula to demonstrate that the asymmetric distribution of the disk of satellites of m31 can be maintained without undue difficulty in nearly spherical potentials .",
    "this is because the outer parts of such galaxies have enormously long memories .",
    "if a loose association of dwarf galaxies were accreted together , then the substructure can survive for timescales longer than the age of the universe .",
    "the accreted dwarfs would still show appreciable spatial asymmetries , much as the m31 satellites do ."
