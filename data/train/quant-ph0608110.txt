    "since the first demonstration of a quantum key distribution ( qkd ) system in 1992  @xcite , there have been numerous efforts toward the implementation of such systems  @xcite with the goal of making quantum cryptography practical by achieving the longest possible communication distance and the highest possible communication rate .",
    "the rapid progress in the field has recently led to the implementation of fiber - based qkd systems that operated at 1  ghz clock frequency  @xcite and extended the key distribution distance to more than 100  km  @xcite .",
    "most of the previous experiments , however , have not been able to guarantee the security of the generated keys against general eavesdropping attacks .",
    "often the average photon number per pulse is set to the arbitrary value 0.1 , which is not the result of a security proof . in the best cases , only a limited set of potential eavesdropping attacks",
    "is taken into account . for implementations of the bb84 protocol  @xcite with a poisson source",
    "this set usually does not include the powerful photon number splitting attack , rendering these systems ultimately insecure  @xcite .",
    "generation of keys that were secure against general individual attacks and their distribution over 50  km of optical fiber using the bb84 protocol with a poisson source and ingaas / inp avalanche photodiodes ( apds ) with a very small dark count rate was reported in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite and @xcite reported implementations of the decoy state bb84 protocol  @xcite , which achieved secure key distribution over 107  km and 60  km of fiber using superconducting transition - edge sensors and ingaas / inp apds , respectively .",
    "all these systems , however , featured a very small secure key generation rate of @xmath31  bit / s , which prevents their integration into practical telecommunication networks .    in the experiment presented in  @xcite , we implemented the differential phase shift quantum key distribution ( dps - qkd ) protocol , which uses a poisson light source  @xcite but is robust to photon number splitting attacks  @xcite .",
    "in this implementation , the security analysis against a limited set of eavesdropping attacks , in particular the beamsplitter , intercept - resend and photon number splitting attacks , was taken into account .",
    "although it is important to demonstrate a practical qkd system that is secure against these realistic attacks , it is also crucial to consider more elaborate attacks that will be within technological reach in the near future and guarantee the security of the system against these types of attacks .",
    "the security of the dps - qkd protocol against all individual attacks allowed by quantum mechanics , including photon number splitting attacks , was proven in  @xcite .",
    "based on this security analysis , the experiment in  @xcite did not generate secure keys over 105  km of fiber . the main limiting factor for the secure key distribution distance in this system was the large bit error rate caused by the broadening of the received signal induced by the large timing jitter of the single - photon detectors employed in the system .",
    "these detectors were based on frequency up - conversion in periodically poled lithium niobate ( ppln ) waveguides and si apds  @xcite , and had a jitter of @xmath4  500 ps . however , up - conversion detectors using si apds with improved timing jitter characteristics were recently reported  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use the security analysis of the dps - qkd protocol against general individual attacks and low jitter up - conversion detectors to implement a secure high speed and long distance quantum key distribution system .",
    "the use of the low jitter detectors significantly improved the signal to noise ratio , which resulted in a smaller bit error rate .",
    "thus , despite the tight security requirements , we achieved the distribution of keys that were secure against all individual attacks allowed by quantum mechanics over 100  km of optical fiber at a rate of 166  bit / s , which is two orders of magnitude higher than previously reported values .",
    "furthermore , using the low jitter detectors allowed us to increase the sifted key generation rate to 2  mbit / s over 10  km of fiber , which is double than the previous record  @xcite .",
    "a quantum key distribution system that implements the dps - qkd protocol is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dps - setup ] .",
    "alice generates a train of coherent pulses , which are attenuated such that the average photon number per pulse is less than 1 , randomly phase modulated by 0 or @xmath5 , and sent over an optical fiber to bob .",
    "each photon coherently spreads over many pulses with a fixed phase modulation pattern . in the receiver side",
    ", bob divides the incoming pulses into two paths and recombines them using 50/50 beamsplitters .",
    "the time delay introduced by his interferometer is equal to the inverse of the clock frequency , or else equal to the time separation between sequential pulses .",
    "single - photon detectors are placed at the output ports of the second beamsplitter . after passing through bob s interferometer ,",
    "the pulses interfere at the output beamsplitter and the phase difference between two consecutive pulses determines which detector records a detection event .",
    "detector 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dps - setup ] records an event when the phase difference is 0 and detector 2 records an event when the phase difference is @xmath5 .",
    "because the average photon number per pulse is less than one , bob observes detection events only occasionally and at random time instances .",
    "bob announces publicly the time instances at which a photon was detected , but he does not reveal which detector detected it . from her modulation data ,",
    "alice knows which detector in bob s site recorded the event .",
    "thus , by assigning bit values 0 and 1 to detection events recorded by detector 1 and 2 , respectively , they form a secret key .        in general terms",
    ", the security of the dps - qkd protocol stems from the nondeterministic collapse of a wavefunction in a quantum measurement .",
    "in particular , if the number of pulses in the coherence time of alice s source is @xmath6 , then each of alice s photons is in a superposition of all the states that correspond to the @xmath6 time instances with the appropriate phase applied to each one of them .",
    "the overall wavefunction is a product state of these individual photon states . at bob s site ,",
    "a detection event at a certain time instance @xmath7 reveals the phase difference between the pulses in time instances @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which corresponds to one bit of information .",
    "however , these detection events occur completely randomly , so an eavesdropper can not deterministically collapse the wavefunction in the same time instance and obtain the same bit of information as bob .    the security of the dps - qkd protocol against general individual attacks was rigorously proven in  @xcite .",
    "this analysis considered a twofold eavesdropping strategy .",
    "eve , the eavesdropper , measures the photon number in the @xmath9-slot wavefunction using a quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement .",
    "then , she sends to bob @xmath10 photons , where @xmath0 is the average photon number per pulse and @xmath11 is the total transmission efficiency of the quantum channel and bob s detection setup , and she stores @xmath12 photons coherently to be measured after alice and bob have revealed all classical information .",
    "this is the photon number splitting attack in the case of the dps - qkd protocol . in the case",
    "that eve is assumed to store and measure her photons individually it was shown in  @xcite that she can obtain complete information for a fraction @xmath13 of the sifted key . when @xmath14 and @xmath0 is small this attack is relatively ineffective for the dps - qkd protocol . however , in the presence of system errors , eve can also apply an optimal measurement attack on a fraction of the photons transmitted to bob . assuming that eve attaches an individual probe state to each single photon , and then measures the probes independently after all classical information has been revealed , it was shown that the collision probability for each bit @xmath15 is bounded as follows  @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the innocent system error rate .",
    "taking into account the results of the photon splitting and general individual attacks analysis , the average collision probability for the @xmath18-bit sifted key , which is a measure of eve s mutual information with alice and bob , is given by the expression : @xmath19^{n\\left[1 - 2\\mu(1-t)\\right ] } \\label{eq : general - pc}\\ ] ] then , the shrinking factor applied during privacy amplification to guarantee the security of the generated key is calculated as follows : @xmath20\\log_2\\left[1-e^2-\\frac{\\left(1 - 6 e\\right)^2}{2}\\right ] \\label{eq : taudps - general}\\ ] ] finally , using the techniques of the generalized privacy amplification theory the secure key generation rate after error correction and privacy amplification is given by the expression  @xcite : @xmath21\\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & r_{\\text{sifted}}\\{-[1 - 2\\mu(1-t)]\\log_2[1-e^2-\\frac{\\left(1 - 6 e\\right)^2}{2 } ] \\nonumber \\\\   & & + f(e)[e\\log_2 e+(1-e)\\log_2(1-e)]\\ } \\label{eq:1ghz - rdpsind}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sifted key generation rate @xmath22 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : up - rrawng ] ) below for the up - conversion single - photon detectors and @xmath23 characterizes the performance of the error correction algorithm .",
    "the qkd experiments presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] are based on the results of the security analysis described here , and in particular eq .",
    "( [ eq:1ghz - rdpsind ] ) .",
    "in the 1.55  @xmath0 m up - conversion single - photon detector  @xcite , a single photon at 1.55  @xmath0 m is combined with a strong pump at 1.32  @xmath0 m in a wavelength division multiplexing coupler , and subsequently the two beams interact in a ppln waveguide , designed for sum frequency generation at these wavelengths .",
    "this device allows for an internal conversion efficiency exceeding 99% of the signal to the 713  nm sum frequency output . after a long - pass filter , a dichroic beamsplitter and a prism that serve the purpose of eliminating the residual pump and its second harmonic ,",
    "the converted photon is detected by a si apd .",
    "the up - conversion detector presents more favorable characteristics for fiber - based quantum cryptography than the commonly used ingaas / inp apd  @xcite .",
    "this is mainly because si apds have a low afterpulse probability , which enables free - running or nongated geiger mode operation .",
    "thus , the sifted key generation rate in the dps - qkd system is only limited by the dead time of the si apd , and is written as : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the detector dead time , @xmath26 the system clock frequency , and the factor @xmath27 in the exponent appears because the average number of photons per second that reach each detector in bob s setup is @xmath28 . for commercial si apds with a dead time on the order of 50 - 80  ns ,",
    "the exponential term becomes appreciable for low fiber losses and high count rates .",
    "the nongated mode operation , however , does not impose any severe limitation on the qkd system clock frequency , which is only determined by the speed of the electronic equipment and the si apd timing jitter . in the experiments described in this paper a clock frequency of 1  ghz",
    "was used , while a 10  ghz system is also possible with these detectors  @xcite .",
    "the quantum efficiency and dark count rate experimental data for the up - conversion single - photon detectors with the low jitter si apds ( mpds ) that were used for the qkd experiments are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qedc ] .",
    "the quantum efficiency of the mpd device at the output signal wavelength of 713  nm is @xmath29% , and so the maximum quantum efficiency of the up - conversion detector , including the coupling , propagation , and collection setup losses , did not exceed 9% for 130  mw of pump power .",
    "the dark counts , on the other hand , increase approximately quadratically with the pump power because of parasitic nonlinear processes in the waveguide and the input fiber  @xcite .    in order to evaluate the performance of the low jitter up - conversion detectors for the dps - qkd system we perform timing jitter measurements . for these measurements , pulses with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 66  ps at a repetition rate of 100  mhz are sent to the detector and the detection signal is recorded with a time interval analyzer . under these conditions , a typical detection signal from the up - conversion single - photon detector with the low jitter si apd",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jitter ] for a count rate of @xmath30  counts / s .",
    "as we observe in this figure , the fwhm is 75  ps , which is significantly smaller than the 500  ps jitter obtained in experiments with high jitter up - conversion detectors .",
    "nevertheless , the detection signal is clearly not gaussian ; there is a tail that can potentially cause errors in the adjacent 1  ns time slot in a dps - qkd experiment with a clock frequency of 1  ghz .",
    "[ fig : jitter ] shows , however , that 1  ns away from the peak the tail is sufficiently small to prevent intersymbol interference .",
    "it is clear that the improvement in timing jitter achieved with the low jitter si apds is significant , and so the error rate should be considerably lower in qkd systems employing these detectors .",

    "the experimental setup for the quantum key distribution experiments that we performed at a 1  ghz clock frequency to implement the dps - qkd protocol with low jitter up - conversion single - photon detectors is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qkd - setup ] . at alice",
    "s site , a continuous wave light at 1.55  @xmath0 m generated from an external cavity semiconductor laser was modulated into a coherent pulse train with a 1  ghz clock frequency using a @xmath31 intensity modulator .",
    "the modulator was driven by a 15  ghz pulse pattern generator , so the pulse width was 66  ps .",
    "subsequently , following the dps - qkd protocol that is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dps - setup ] , the phase of each pulse was modulated by 0 or @xmath5 with a @xmath31 phase modulator .",
    "the phase modulation signal was a 1  gbit / s pseudo - random bit sequence with a length of @xmath32 bits , which was generated by a data generator .",
    "the pulses were appropriately attenuated and sent to bob s site through an optical fiber , where a 1-bit delay mach - zehnder interferometer based on planar lightwave circuit ( plc ) technology was installed .",
    "the insertion loss of the interferometer was 2  db , and the extinction ratio was greater than 20  db .",
    "one 1.55  @xmath0 m up - conversion single - photon detector was connected to each of the output ports of the interferometer .",
    "the events detected by the two si apds were recorded using a time interval analyzer .    in order to reduce the bit error rate caused by the large dark counts of the up - conversion detector we set the pump power at relatively low levels , at the expense of reduced quantum efficiency and",
    "thus reduced key generation rate as well . to further reduce the bit error rate due to dark counts",
    "we applied a time window to the recorded data . because of the improved timing jitter characteristics of the up - conversion detector , which induces a small pulse broadening as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : jitter ] , the signal counts are concentrated in small time segments while the dark counts are randomly distributed . therefore , we can use short measurement time windows to reduce the effective dark counts and improve the signal to noise ratio .",
    "this results in a significantly smaller bit error rate .    before performing qkd experiments",
    ", we set the average photon number per pulse @xmath0 at its optimal value .",
    "in particular , based on the experimental parameters of the system , we maximized the secure key generation rate with respect to @xmath0 using eq .",
    "( [ eq:1ghz - rdpsind ] ) which corresponds to the general individual attacks security analysis .",
    "the optimal value was 0.2 .",
    "subsequently , we performed qkd experiments , that is we measured the generation rate of the sifted keys that alice and bob exchanged , and by directly comparing the yielded keys we also measured the bit error rate of the transmission . for each fiber length",
    ", we measured the sifted key generation rate and error rate five times and took the average values .",
    "we then calculated the secure key generation rate from eq .",
    "( [ eq:1ghz - rdpsind ] ) using the experimental results for the sifted key generation rates and bit error rates .",
    "alice and bob were located in the same room and we performed fiber transmission experiments using fiber spools , while some additional data were taken with an optical attenuator simulating fiber loss .",

    "a baseline system error rate of 1.5% is assumed in all theoretical calculations.,width=377 ]    we first set the detector operating condition to levels appropriate for achieving high speed quantum key distribution over a short communication distance .",
    "more specifically , the quantum efficiency and dark count rate of the low jitter up - conversion detectors were set to 6% and 98  khz , respectively .",
    "these values do not correspond to the same pump power level in fig .",
    "[ fig : qedc ] because the performance of the detectors was slightly degraded when the qkd experiments were performed compared to when the quantum efficiency and dark count rate data were taken .",
    "we set the time window width to 200  ps , so the dark counts per time window in these experiments were @xmath33 .",
    "the use of the 200  ps time window also decreased the effective quantum efficiency by 40% . under these operating conditions",

    ". a baseline system bit error rate of 1.5% was assumed in these calculations .",
    "the clear square represents the fiber transmission experimental result for the secure key generation rate , while the sifted key generation rate at the corresponding fiber length is represented by the clear diamond .",
    "the clear circles and stars show the experimental results when we simulated additional fiber loss with an optical attenuator . as we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] , the theoretical curves fit very well with the experimental results . at the fiber length of 10  km we achieved a sifted key generation rate of 2",
    "mbit / s with a bit error rate of 2.2% , thus the secure key generation rate at this fiber length was 0.468  mbit / s .",
    "the use of the low jitter detectors resulted in a double sifted rate at small fiber loss compared to previous experiments with high jitter up - conversion detectors  @xcite because of the significantly reduced error rate .",
    "subsequently , we set the quantum efficiency , dark count rate , and time window width to 0.4% , 350  hz and 100  ps , respectively , to further reduce the errors caused by dark counts and thus improve the signal to noise ratio to achieve long distance quantum cryptography .",
    "the use of the 100  ps time window set the dark counts per time window to @xmath36 , and also reduced the effective quantum efficiency of the detector by 54% . under these operating conditions",

    "the filled squares and diamonds represent the fiber transmission experimental results , while the filled circles and stars correspond to data taken using the attenuator to simulate additional fiber loss .",
    "again , we observe that the theoretical curves fit very well with the experimental data . by using these operating conditions , keys that were secure against general individual eavesdropping attacks",
    "were distributed at a rate of 166  bits / s over 100  km of fiber .",
    "the bit error rate for the 100  km experiment was 3.4% , of which 1% is attributed to imperfect interferometry , 1.7% to detector dark counts , and the remaining 0.7% to the timing jitter .",
    "this result shows that the key distribution distance for which security against all individual attacks allowed by quantum mechanics is guaranteed for the dps - qkd protocol was considerably extended because of the improved timing jitter characteristics of the up - conversion detectors employed in the system .",
    "these characteristics led to small pulse broadening , which allowed the use of a short measurement time window to substantially reduce the effective dark counts , thus improving the signal to noise ratio and decreasing the bit error rate .",
    "we presented a practical and secure quantum key distribution system that implemented the differential phase shift quantum key distribution protocol with low jitter up - conversion detectors .",
    "we showed that the improved timing jitter characteristics of the detectors allowed us to significantly increase both the key distribution rate and distance of the dps - qkd system , while at the same time guaranteeing its security against the most general individual eavesdropping attacks allowed by quantum mechanics . with this system we achieved a 2  mbit / s sifted key generation rate with a corresponding secure key generation rate of 0.468  mbit / s over 10  km of optical fiber , and",
    "secure key distribution over 100  km of fiber at a rate of 166  bit / s , which is two orders of magnitude higher than previously reported values .",
    "the quantum cryptography system we presented achieves a sufficiently high communication rate and a long enough communication distance to be able to operate in a standard telecommunication network .",
    "however , the system s capabilities can be further extended by improving the dark count behavior of the up - conversion detectors and the timing jitter characteristics of the si apds .",
    "the dark counts caused by noise photons generated via spontaneous raman scattering can be reduced by using a shorter signal wavelength than pump wavelength , while single - photon detectors with a gaussian response and narrow fwhm based for example on photomultiplier tubes may soon become available .",
    "this will open the way to megahertz secure key generation rates and very long distance secure communication .",
