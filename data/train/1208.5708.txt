    "topological band insulators ( tbis ) have recently opened a new frontier in both theoretical and experimental condensed - matter physics due to their peculiar properties ( extensive reviews are in refs .",
    "these stem from the fundamental fact that tbis are described by topological field theories @xcite , thereby taking the interest in studying them far outside the standard condensed - matter domain .",
    "the novelty of tbis is their protection by time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) , which leads to a non - trivial topological @xmath2 invariant @xcite of their free electron crystalline band structure , and to a description in terms of the topological @xmath3 theory in ( 2 + 1)d and ( 3 + 1)d  @xcite .",
    "striking consequences of their topological nature are the remarkable effective field theories describing the responses of tbis , for instance , axion electrodynamics in ( 3 + 1)d @xcite and gravitational chern - simons in thermal response @xcite .",
    "such theories are governed by anomalies , and the possibility of their direct study , e.g. through the witten effect of axion electrodynamics @xcite , is of great interest and potential for both the high - energy and condensed matter communities .",
    "further beyond the non - interacting case , there has been a proposal of ( 3 + 1)d fractional tbis @xcite , having trs and an axion angle different from @xmath4 or @xmath0 ; these have a description in the form of deconfined non - abelian gauge fields explicitly realized using holography @xcite .",
    "the salient feature of tbis , crucial for their characterization and detection , is that they are fully gapped in the bulk while possessing on their boundary gapless propagating modes protected by trs .",
    "@xcite the presence of trs however limits , fundamentally and especially experimentally , the availability of robust probes of such bulk - boundary correspondence , aforementioned anomalous responses , and @xmath2 topological order itself .",
    "for instance , in ( 2 + 1)d tbis , on which we are focusing from now on , the charge hall response vanishes , and instead a much more involved trs invariant quantum spin hall ( qsh ) effect characterizes the topological phase .",
    "it has been understood through numeric studies that a @xmath0-flux vortex , which actually preserves trs , can play exactly the role of a @xmath2 probe in a qsh insulator through appearance of topologically protected zero - modes .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we analytically study the properties of @xmath0-flux vortex in presence and absence of @xmath2 order . the general way by which we achieve this is using the @xmath1 model initially constructed to describe the hgte quantum well qsh insulator .",
    "@xcite the salient and universal feature of the low - energy ( continuum ) version of this model is that it describes a topological phase transition between a trivial and non - trivial @xmath2 topological phase , through a massive dirac - schr \" odinger theory .",
    "this field theory , especially in the presence of a @xmath5 vortex , has not been widely studied for its own sake .",
    "a peculiar property of this theory is that the presence of both linear and quadratic kinetic terms together with the ordinary dirac mass term allows for a gap - closing transition which changes the chern number of the bands and the @xmath2 invariant .",
    "the same theory turns out to harbor analytically solvable zero - modes tied to @xmath0-flux vortex , but only in the non - trivial phase .",
    "the relationship of the @xmath0-flux modes to the qsh phase and the question of their protection are general problems in the context of zero - energy fermionic modes bound to a topological defect .",
    "namely , as aharonov and casher have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , when non - relativistic ( schr \" odinger ) fermions are coupled to a magnetic flux carrying @xmath6 flux quanta there are precisely @xmath6 zero - energy modes in the spectrum of the hamiltonian .",
    "later , jackiw in ref .",
    "@xcite has demonstrated that a magnetic flux with @xmath6 flux quanta hosts precisely @xmath6 zero - energy modes when coupled to relativistic dirac fermions , and they are related to an index theorem for the dirac hamiltonian defined on a compact space.@xcite on the other hand , the existence of fermionic zero - modes bound to a vortex in the complex scalar order parameter has actually been established in one and two spatial dimensions in the pioneering works by jackiw and rebbi@xcite and jackiw and rossi@xcite , respectively .",
    "their existence is , at the deep mathematical level , tied to an index theorem that relates the spectral asymmetry of the corresponding hamiltonian defined on an open space and a topological invariant of the background scalar fields.@xcite at the same time , the results of jackiw and rebbi have been applied to the polyacetilene system through the su - schrieffer - heeger model.@xcite however , the connection between jackiw - rossi and the @xmath1 model , relevant for the quantum spin hall system , has been shown only very recently in ref .",
    "namely , these authors have demonstrated that the jackiw - rossi model in the limit when zeeman coupling and the chemical potential are large reduces to the @xmath1 model , and therefore the results presented in this work are also relevant for this problem .",
    "moreover , a hamiltonian of the same form as the @xmath1 hamiltonian describes non - relativistic @xmath7 superconductor , and the results of our work are thus relevant for this system as well .",
    "in particular , our solution for the zero - energy mode bound to a @xmath0-flux vortex in the quantum spin hall state corresponds to the majorana state in the core of a @xmath0-flux vortex in this topological superconductor .",
    "the flux - carrying vortex is by its definition singular in real space .",
    "it is well known that a hamiltonian with singular potential ( e.g. aharonov - bohm flux vortex  @xcite , coulomb potential  @xcite , delta function potential  @xcite ) , once made hermitian through a self - adjoint extension @xcite , can exhibit finite or zero - energy bound states , even if the original hamiltonian was scale - free .",
    "therefore , the question of regularizing the vortex singularity , and thereby completely defining a hermitian fermionic theory , becomes physically relevant .",
    "it fixes the real space profile of zero - modes at the vortex and the scattering phase shift there .",
    "this problem has been considered for ( 2 + 1)d  @xcite , and ( 3 + 1)d  @xcite dirac particles , as well as quasiparticles in superconductors  @xcite .",
    "the dirac - schr \" odinger theory of the @xmath1 model has not been studied in this context before , and we find here the general form of the regularized theory in presence of a magnetic @xmath0 flux vortex .",
    "furthermore , we show that a regularization corresponding to a thin solenoid limit surprisingly leads to localized zero - modes that vanish at the origin . in this paper",
    ", we first explicitly introduce the tight - binding and continuum @xmath1 models .",
    "then we use the continuum @xmath1 model to analytically show that the @xmath0-flux vortex hosts precisely a pair of exponentially localized zero - energy modes , and therefore the states found numerically in refs .",
    "@xcite are indeed a generic feature of the @xmath1 model .",
    "moreover , the relationship of these midgap states with the topological properties of the quantum spin hall state are also considered .",
    "namely , we show that these modes , in fact , exist in the entire range of parameters describing topologically non - trivial phase in the @xmath1 model with the gap opening near the zero momentum ( @xmath8 point ) in the brillouin zone . for obtaining the explicit form of the midgap states , a short - distance regularization of the hamiltonian is necessary due to the singularity of the vortex potential .",
    "we show that a particular choice , corresponding to a limit of infinitely thin solenoid , yields the modes non - singular at the origin .",
    "we then consider in full generality the problem of consistent regularization of the vortex potential , and show that the corresponding self - adjoint extensions are given in terms of parameters described by @xmath9 matrices .",
    "next , we test the prediction for the localization length of the zero - modes obtained from the continuum theory as a function of the transition driving parameter by comparing it to the results from a lattice regularization of the model . finally , we discuss the quantum numbers of the obtained zero - energy states .",
    "we begin by considering a minimal tight - binding model proposed to describe a two - band quantum spin hall insulator @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 representing two low - energy orbitals .",
    "the upper and the lower blocks in the hamiltonian are related by time - reversal symmetry , and @xmath14 acting in the orbital space has the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , are the pauli matrices , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , the length unit is set by lattice constant @xmath20 , and summation over repeated indices is assumed hereafter .",
    "we also set @xmath21 in the following , unless otherwise stated .",
    "since the above hamiltonian has spectrum @xmath22 doubly degenerate in spin space , the band gap closes at the @xmath8-point ( @xmath23 ) in the brillouin zone when the value of model parameters is @xmath24 .",
    "we will only consider the range of parameters @xmath25 in what follows , so that the spectrum is gapped .",
    "this lattice model then describes a topologically nontrivial state with a kramers pair of counterpropagating modes on the edge of the system leading to a quantized spin hall conductance@xcite @xmath26 . for negative values of @xmath27 ,",
    "the model describes a trivial insulator ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "by taking the continuum , i.e. large wavelength limit ( @xmath29 ) of , we arrive at a dirac hamiltonian which besides the ordinary dirac mass term ( @xmath30 ) contains a schr \" odinger kinetic term ( @xmath31 ) @xmath32 where the four - dimensional @xmath33-matrices are given by @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 . here",
    ", pauli matrices @xmath37 act in spin space , with @xmath38 as the @xmath39 identity matrices .",
    "the @xmath33-matrices satisfy canonical anticommutation relations @xmath40 , with @xmath41 . notice that it is enough to focus on a single spin projection , since the two spin projections are related by the time - reversal operator @xmath42 , with @xmath43 as the complex conjugation . for convenience",
    ", we have divided through eq .   by the energy scale @xmath44",
    "( the lattice intersite hopping energy ) and by the length - scale @xmath45 , before redefining @xmath46 , @xmath47 , so that the continuum theory eq .",
    "has a dimensionless parameter @xmath48 and parameters @xmath31 and @xmath49 with dimension of length ( we revert to lattice units for comparison to the tight binding model in section [ sec : tb ] ) .",
    "let us now consider the effect of the magnetic @xmath0-flux inserted into the system . as usually , the vector potential is coupled to the electronic degrees of freedom through the minimal substitution , @xmath50 , and the hamiltonian ( [ eq : cont - ham ] ) for spin up electrons assumes the form @xmath51\\sigma_3.\\ ] ] the vector potential @xmath52 represents the magnetic vortex carrying the flux @xmath53 .",
    "notice that the spin down electrons are coupled to the @xmath0-flux with the opposite sign because of the time - reversal symmetry , and in that respect @xmath0-flux thus acts on the spin components as a pseudomagnetic vortex in graphene does on the two valley degrees of freedom.@xcite of course , the time - reversal invariance of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham - a ] ) is present only when the flux corresponding to the vector potential @xmath54 is equal to @xmath0 or @xmath4 .",
    "we now show that the above hamiltonian possesses precisely one bulk zero - energy state with spin up . time - reversal symmetry then implies the existence of the zero - energy state for electrons with spin down . expressing the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham - a ] ) in polar",

    "it is easy to see that in case of an arbitrary flux @xmath60 , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham - a ] ) also acquires the form ( [ eq : ham - a - explicit ] ) , but with the operator @xmath61 .    in the presence of a vortex carrying a @xmath0-flux",
    ", we seek the zero - energy modes of the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the angular momentum quantum number , and the functions @xmath64 are the solutions of the following equations @xmath65 here the operator @xmath66 is defined as @xmath67 acting on eq .",

    "( [ eq : zero - energy - spinor ] ) is an eigenstate with the zero eigenvalue of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham - a ] ) , then it is also an eigenstate with the same eigenvalue of the square of this hamiltonian . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham - a ] ) , one then readily obtains @xmath73 with @xmath74 , and the operator @xmath75 after acting on the angular part of the upper component of the spinor ( [ eq : zero - energy - spinor ] ) yields eq .",
    "( [ eq : zero - mode - u ] ) .",
    "similarly , it may be shown that the function @xmath70 in the spinor given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : zero - energy - spinor ] ) obeys an equation of the same form as ( [ eq : zero - mode - u ] ) with @xmath76 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : zero - mode - u ] ) we conclude that the function @xmath77 is an eigenfunction of the operator @xmath78 with a _ positive _ eigenvalue @xmath79 since the operator @xmath75 when acting on a function with the angular momentum @xmath80 is equal to @xmath81 , and the eigenstates of the operator @xmath75 with a _ negative _ eigenvalue are localized .",
    "( [ eq : zero - mode - u ] ) and ( [ eq : u ] ) then imply @xmath82 and the function @xmath83 with @xmath84 as the modified bessel function of the first kind",
    ". however , from the above solutions the only square - integrable ones are in the zero angular - momentum channel since @xmath85 as @xmath86 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath87 only the linear combination @xmath88 has the asymptotic behavior at infinity consistent with a finite norm of the state . in the above equation",
    "we should distinguish two regimes of parameters , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , for which the argument of the square - root is positive and negative , respectively .    for @xmath89 ,",
    "since the argument of the square - root in the above equation is positive , we obtain two zero - energy solutions @xmath91 and , of course , @xmath92 because of the square - integrability . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath90 , up to a normalization constant , the solutions have the form @xmath93 where @xmath94 however , since the identity @xmath95 holds for @xmath96 , the localization length of the zero - modes for @xmath90 is actually independent of @xmath30 , namely eqs .",
    "become @xmath97 therefore , we can conclude that the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham - a ] ) possesses zero - energy modes in the entire range of parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 for which the system is in the topologically non - trivially phase , @xmath25 .",
    "in particular , as it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda - square ] ) , when @xmath98 zero - energy states are purely exponentially localized , while for @xmath99 the exponentially localized solutions have an oscillatory part with a characteristic length - scale exactly equal to the localization length . notice also that in the regime when @xmath89 , there are two characteristic length scales associated with the midgap modes , @xmath100 .",
    "of course , after a short - distance regularization is imposed , only a linear combination of the two states survives .",
    "the physical interpretation of the two length scales depends on the form of the superposition of the state after the regularization has been imposed , as it may be easily seen from the form of the states . in the regime @xmath90 ,",
    "the zero - energy states are characterized by a single length - scale @xmath101 , which is at the same time the localization length and characterizes the oscillations of the exponentially decaying state .",
    "therefore , the appearance of the zero - energy states bound to a @xmath0-flux vortex is a generic feature of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : cont - ham ] ) describing the quantum spin hall system .",
    "furthermore , in the vortex - free system , it may be shown by imposing open boundary conditions on the wave - function at one of the edges of the system , for instance the one perpendicular to the @xmath102-axis , and at infinity , @xmath103 , that the hamiltonian gives rise to gapless edge modes with the penetration depth given by exactly the same expression as the localization length for the zero - energy modes bound to the @xmath0-flux vortex .",
    "the bulk - boundary correspondence may be thus probed by inserting a @xmath0-flux vortex in the quantum spin hall system .",
    "the zero - energy modes , given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : zero - energy - states1 ] ) and ( [ eq : zero - energy - states2final ] ) , form an overcomplete basis in the zero angular - momentum channel , because the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham - a ] ) is not self - adjoint , which is due to the singularity of the vortex vector potential ( [ eq : a ] ) at the origin . thus the gauge potential has to be regularized .",
    "a possible regularization is provided by considering the vortex with the flux concentrated in a thin annulus of a radius @xmath104 .",
    "let us first consider the hamiltonian in the range of parameters @xmath89 .",
    "the zero - energy state of the hamiltonian outside the annulus is then a linear combination of the modes @xmath105 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : zero - energy - states1 ] ) . inside the annulus",
    "the vector potential @xmath106 , and the zero - energy modes are @xmath107 with @xmath108 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda - square ] ) , and @xmath109 being complex constants . by matching these solutions at @xmath110 , and taking @xmath111",
    ", we obtain , up to a normalization constant , the zero - energy state of the form @xmath112 notice that this zero - energy state is regular at the origin which is a consequence of the regularity at the origin of the solutions ( [ eq : vortex - free ] ) of the vortex - free problem .",
    "similarly , one may show that when @xmath90 the zero - energy mode is given by the spinor @xmath113 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : zero - energy - states2 ] ) also regular at the origin and behaving @xmath114 when @xmath115 .",
    "although the above regularization results in concrete solutions to the problem , we should consider the self - adjoint extension of the corresponding hamiltonian in a more general manner by specifying the proper hilbert space .",
    "that way , a family of hermitian hamiltonians is obtained , depending on free physical parameters that determine the scattering at the vortex core and the detailed profile of the single zero - mode ( per spin ) . in the last section , we will comment on the regularization provided by the tight - binding version of the model , eq .  .",
    "the application of the standard theory of self - adjoint extensions ( sae ) @xcite prescribes that we need to ensure that the massive dirac hamiltonian ( a differential operator ) becomes hermitian ( self - adjoint ) only after choosing the proper hilbert space ( i.e. domain of functions ) on which it is allowed to act . instead of analyzing the imaginary spectrum ( which needs to be removed )",
    ", we implement von neumann s construction by looking directly at the conditions under which the hamiltonian is hermitian when acting on arbitrary functions that are square integrable ( but might diverge at the origin , due to diverging potential there ) .",
    "this will effectively determine the coefficients of the linear combination @xmath116 in angular momentum channel @xmath87 and thereby fix the zero - mode .",
    "using symmetry , we start from the radial part of the operator , @xmath117 , which acts in the subspace of angular momentum @xmath80 spanned by functions of the form @xmath118 completely determined by @xmath119 . recall that the zero - energy states of the @xmath1 model in presence of a @xmath0-flux vortex come in the form of kramers pairs @xmath120 where @xmath121 is exactly of the form in eq .  .",
    "we also implement the standard change of scalar product in @xmath122-space by rescaling @xmath123 , @xmath124 ( @xmath125 always denotes @xmath126 ) , where @xmath127 , after which @xmath128 takes the form @xmath129 we have reverted to the standard derivative ( @xmath125 ) here . since the @xmath0-flux enters through @xmath130 , we omit it here .",
    "the non - derivative terms will not play any role in the following analysis since the standard centrifugal force provided by @xmath131 does not lead to singularities .",
    "however , the gauge potential will have the chance to provide us with the boundary condition exactly when @xmath87 .",
    "now , for two arbitrary wavefunctions @xmath132 , @xmath133 which are determined by @xmath134 , @xmath135 ( we dropped index @xmath80 ) , respectively , the condition of hermiticity of @xmath136 becomes ( note the change in @xmath137 ) : @xmath138(0)\\notag\\\\    & \\equiv 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath139 pauli matrices act on the two component functions , which vanish at infinity , and are evaluated at the origin ( point @xmath140 ) in the next - to - last line",
    ".    there is a continuous family of restrictions on the behavior of square - integrable functions at the origin , such that is satisfied , leading to the hamiltonian which is hermitian on such a chosen domain .",
    "the proper parametrization of the most general restriction on the allowed domains is achieved by using the linearity of .",

    "since @xmath151 and @xmath152 take on arbitrary values , this means that the boundary space indeed is @xmath153 .",
    "the most general relation that has to be satisfied by a wavefunction such that will hold is now parametrized by unitary mappings @xmath154 in @xmath155 : @xmath156 with @xmath157 the 2x2 identity matrix , and @xmath158 denoting the domain of operator .",
    "one can directly understand from that forcing arbitrary linear combinations of a general @xmath159 and @xmath160 to zero will still preserve the condition , due to the linearity and the antisymmetric nature of the form of this expression .",

    "we emphasize that here , as for @xmath176 case , demanding a zero - mode with @xmath191 implies from eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) that the columns of @xmath203 have to be the same .",
    "since @xmath189 are not degenerate for physical values of @xmath48 , this gives @xmath227 , i.e. the already considered demand that the matrix @xmath223 vanishes , which is impossible when @xmath221 .",

    "to summarize , the sae analysis of the @xmath1 model shows that a @xmath9 parametrization which completes this model allows the existence of zero modesfor a subclass of hamiltonians described by three free angle parameters , e.g. @xmath232 in eq .  .",
    "these determine a matrix relating the value of the wavefunction spinor to its derivative , both taken at the origin , according to eq .  .",

    "we numerically study this model on a 31x31 sized square lattice with periodic boundary conditions and a @xmath0-flux ",
    "anti-@xmath0-flux pair positioned at maximal distance .",
    "the details of this tight - binding model written in real space , i.e. on the lattice , are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we first isolate the zero energy mode localized on a single @xmath0-flux , using the nearly degenerate inversion - symmetric and anti - symmetric zero modes on the finite lattice .",
    "the lattice symmetries guarantee the @xmath242 form of the wavefunction spinor , with @xmath132 the polar angle , just as in the continuum . by fitting the radial envelope of the spinor using eq .",
    "( [ eq : zero - energy - states1 ] ) and the angle - averaged wavefunction , we extract the two localization lengths @xmath243 in units of the lattice constant .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) .",
    "the agreement with the present continuum model prediction , see text after eq .   and eq .  , is excellent in the @xmath164 regime ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) ) . for @xmath90 the oscillatory part of the wavefunction ( see eq .  ) makes the numerical fitting less reliable , and the agreement is only qualitative .",
    "one should note that the lattice tight - binding model has a natural length - scale , the lattice constant @xmath45 , beside its dimensionless constants @xmath244 ( in units of inter - site hopping energy @xmath44 ) , see eq .  .",
    "in the present continuum model , eq .  , the parameters @xmath180 determine two length - scales , @xmath31 and @xmath245 , where the former acts as a length - scale in the zero - modes .",
    "the lattice constant is simply absorbed by @xmath244 to give @xmath180 of the continuum model ( see eq .  ) , and that is why the agreement in fig .  [ fig:2](a ) is quantitatively precise .",
    "( in the lattice calculation we actually set @xmath246 and vary only @xmath247 , driving therefore both the parameter @xmath248 and the lattice topological transition parameter @xmath249 . ) to determine the sae which is realized in the lattice model , we calculate the complex constant @xmath234 , which was defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq:17 ] ) , and represents the ratio of contributions of two singular functions in the zero - mode wavefunction , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : zero - energy - states1 ] ) ,  ( [ eq : zero - energy - states2final ] ) . fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) shows that throughout the regime @xmath164 , @xmath102 keeps near the value @xmath191 , which is the special case of zero - mode being regular at the @xmath0-flux position .",
    "as shown above , only a single sae allows this , and this sae is also realized in a thin - solenoid regularization of the continuum model .",
    "we will now show that these zero - energy modes carry non - trivial charge or spin quantum number depending on their occupation . for that purpose , we will write the continuum @xmath250 hamiltonian ( [ eq : cont - ham ] ) coupled to a @xmath5 vector potential as @xmath251 with the vector potential @xmath54 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : a ] ) . note that the unitary matrices @xmath252 and @xmath253 anticommute with the gamma - matrices @xmath254 , @xmath255 .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian anticommutes with the matrices @xmath256 and @xmath257 which then generate chiral ( spectral ) symmetry relating states with positive and negative energies , i.e. , if @xmath258 , then , for instance , @xmath259 , and the matrix @xmath260 reduces in the zero - energy subspace of the hamiltonian .",
    "these two properties then imply that in the ground - state the expectation value of a traceless hermitian operator @xmath261 is given in terms of the zero - energy states of the hamiltonian @xmath262 therefore , in the case of a quantum spin hall insulator threaded by a @xmath0-flux vortex , depending on the occupation of a pair of zero - energy states , there are four possibilities for the ground state quantum numbers .",
    "namely , when both states are occupied or empty , according to the above expression , the charge is @xmath263 or @xmath264 and the spin quantum number is zero .",
    "on the other hand , when one of the states is occupied , the spin quantum number is @xmath265 or @xmath266 , while the charge is zero . in that way",
    ", the spin - charge separation , characteristic for one - dimensional systems@xcite , appears also in a two - dimensional system @xcite , and is tied to a topologically non - trivial nature of the quantum spin hall state @xcite .",
    "similarly , zero - energy modes bound to the vortex core in an antiferromagnetic state on a honeycomb lattice lead to the phenomenon of spin fragmentation @xcite ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a general discussion of this class of problems in the context of dirac systems .",
    "finally , let us note that the topological stability of @xmath0-flux zero - modes , i.e. stability under smooth deformations of the vector potential , has been strictly proved for both dirac and schr \" odinger hamiltonians @xcite , but for the @xmath1 model , which is a sum of both , we are not aware of an analogous proof based on an index theorem .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that a pair of zero - modes bound to a magnetic @xmath0-flux are a generic feature of the @xmath1 model in the topologically non - trivial phase .",
    "the continuum hamiltonian of that model has both dirac and schr \" odinger kinetic terms and a mass , and has not been studied in detail previously .",
    "we have analytically found the zero - modes in the presence of the @xmath0-flux vortex in the entire range of parameters describing a topologically non - trivial phase with the bandgap opening at the zero momentum .",
    "these modes are exponentially localized around the vortex core , and a particular regularization of the vector potential corresponding to the vortex yields the modes regular at the origin , but in general , as we have shown , the form of the solution depends on the short - distance regularization of the vortex .",
    "vortex zero modes obtained within a lattice tight - binding model match the ones found for a particular self - adjoint extension of the continuum hamiltonian .",
    "finally , we discussed a realization of the two - dimensional spin - charge separation through the vortex zero - modes .",
