    "it has recently been proved in @xcite that the dirac equation does not admit normalizable , time - periodic solutions in a non - extreme reissner - nordstrm black hole geometry .",
    "this result shows that quantization and the introduction of spin cause a significant qualitative break - down of the classical situation , where it is well - known that there exist special choices of initial conditions for the motion of massive test particles which give rise to closed orbits @xcite .",
    "indeed , the above theorem implies that the quantum mechanical dirac wave function in the gravitational and electromagnetic fields of a static , spherically symmetric black hole describes a particle which must either disappear into the black hole or escape to infinity .",
    "it is quite natural to ask whether this result is stable under perturbations of the background metric ; i.e. , if the non - existence theorem for normalizable periodic solutions of the dirac equation remains true if the background metric and electromagnetic field are changed in such a way that the spherical symmetry is destroyed .",
    "this is precisely the question that we address in this paper .",
    "we are guided in our choice of a more general background geometry by the uniqueness theorems of carter , israel , and robinson  @xcite , from which we know that the most general charged black hole equilibrium state is given by the kerr - newman solution of the einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "thus , in order to investigate the non - existence of periodic solutions in the most general black hole geometry , we have to study the dirac equation in the kerr - newman background .",
    "the fact that this study is even possible rests on the remarkable discovery made by chandrasekhar that the dirac equation is completely separable into ordinary differential equations in the kerr - newman background geometry , even though the metric is stationary and axisymmetric @xcite .",
    "in order to state our result , let us first recall that the kerr - newman solution is characterized by three parameters , namely its mass @xmath0 , angular momentum @xmath1 and electric charge @xmath2 .",
    "we prove that the non - existence theorem for normalizable solutions of the dirac equation remains true in the case of a rotating kerr - newman black hole provided that the angular momentum per unit mass and the charge are sufficiently small relative to the total mass of the black hole .",
    "such black holes have both a cauchy and an event horizon , and are thus referred to as _ non - extreme _ black holes .",
    "specifically , we prove :    [ thm1 ] in a kerr - newman black hole for which @xmath3 , the dirac equation has no normalizable , time - periodic solutions .    in theorem  [ thm2 ] , we give a similar non - existence result for the most general stationary , axisymmetric metric in which the dirac equation can be separated by chandrasekhar s method .",
    "the hypotheses of this theorem are stated as much as possible in geometric terms . while the solutions one obtains by imposing the einstein - maxwell equations on this metric are of limited physical interest , this theorem indicates that our non - existence result applies in a broader context ( e.g.  for a more general energy - momentum tensor ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec21 ]",
    ", we derive the separability of the dirac equation in the kerr - newman geometry in a form slightly different from the one used by chandrasekhar so as to recover the equations established in @xcite in the spherically symmetric limit , by letting the angular momentum parameter @xmath4 tend to zero . in section  [ sec22 ]",
    ", we work out matching conditions for the spinor field across the horizons .",
    "this gives rise to a weak solution of the dirac equation in the physical region of the maximal analytic extension of the kerr - newman solution , which is valid across the cauchy and event horizons .",
    "we then proceed in section  [ sec23 ] to establish the non - existence of time - periodic solutions .",
    "just as in the spherically symmetric case , the crucial step consists in exploiting the conservation and positivity of the dirac current to show that because of the matching conditions , the only way in which a time - periodic solution of the dirac equation can be normalizable is that each term in the fourier expansion of the spinor field in time and the angular variable around the axis of symmetry , be identically zero .",
    "while the regularity of the angular dependence of the separable solutions is manifest in the spherically symmetric reissner - nordstrm case , this is not so in the axisymmetric case treated in this paper .",
    "the regularity is therefore established in the appendix .",
    "finally , we consider in section  [ sec3 ] the extension of theorem  [ thm1 ] to more general stationary axisymmetric metrics .",
    "recall that , in boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath5 , the kerr - newman metric takes the form @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 and the electromagnetic potential is of the form @xmath8 the metric is singular at the origin @xmath9 and at the zeros of the function @xmath10 .",
    "we shall consider the so - called _ non - extreme case _ @xmath11 . in this case",
    ", @xmath10 has two distinct zeros @xmath12 the two radii @xmath13 and @xmath14 correspond to the _ cauchy horizon _ and the _ event horizon _ for the non - extreme kerr - newman metric , respectively .",
    "we briefly recall some elementary facts about the dirac operator in curved space - time .",
    "the dirac operator @xmath15 is a differential operator of first order , @xmath16 where @xmath17 and the dirac matrices @xmath18 are @xmath19-matrices .",
    "the dirac matrices are related to the lorentzian metric via the anti - commutation relations @xmath20 the matrix @xmath17 is determined by the spinor connection and the electromagnetic potential through minimal coupling . as such , it is determined by the levi - civita connection of the background lorentzian metric ( [ eq:0 ] ) and the potential ( [ eq:1b ] ) .",
    "the dirac matrices are not uniquely determined by the anti - commutation rules ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "the ambiguity in the choice of dirac matrices adapted to a given metric is formulated naturally in terms of the spin and frame bundles @xcite . a convenient method for calculating the dirac operator in this bundle formulation",
    "is provided by the newman - penrose formalism @xcite . more generally ,",
    "it is shown in @xcite that all choices of dirac matrices satisfying ( [ eq:2 ] ) yield unitarily equivalent dirac operators . furthermore , in @xcite , explicit formulas for the matrix @xmath17 in terms of the dirac matrices @xmath18 are given . in the following ,",
    "we attempt to combine the advantages of these different approaches ; namely , we first choose the dirac matrices using a newman - penrose frame , and then construct the matrix @xmath17 using the explicit formulas in @xcite .",
    "we choose the so - called _ symmetric frame _",
    "@xmath21 of @xcite , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the step function @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 otherwise .",
    "( because of its symmetry properties , this frame is somewhat more convenient than the kinnersley frame used in @xcite . also , the notation with the step function allows us to give a unified form of the frame both inside and outside the horizons . )",
    "the symmetric frame is a newman - penrose null frame ; i.e. @xmath27 and all other scalar products between the elements of the frame vanish . from this complex null frame",
    ", we can form a real frame @xmath28 by setting @xmath29 this frame is orthonormal ; i.e. @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the minkowski metric .",
    "we choose the dirac matrices @xmath32 , @xmath33 of minkowski space in the weyl representation @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the usual pauli matrices @xmath36 the @xmath32 satisfy the anti - commutation relations @xmath37 we choose as dirac matrices @xmath18 associated to the kerr - newman metric the following linear combinations of the @xmath32 : @xmath38 as an immediate consequence of ( [ eq:3 ] ) and ( [ eq:4 ] ) , these dirac matrices satisfy the anti - commutation relations ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "next , we must calculate the matrix @xmath17 in ( [ eq:1 ] ) . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the dirac matrices induce a spin connection @xmath39 , which has the general form @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the pseudoscalar matrix , @xmath42 is the levi - civita symbol of curved space - time , and @xmath43 is the electromagnetic potential . using the spin connection , the dirac operator ( [ eq:1 ] ) can be written in the alternative form @xmath44 .",
    "thus the matrix @xmath17 is given by @xmath45 . since , in our context , the dirac matrices @xmath18 are linear combinations of the @xmath32 , the matrix @xmath46 is simply the constant @xmath47 . as a consequence , the first and last summands in ( [ eq:4b ] ) vanish , and we obtain @xmath48 using ricci s lemma , @xmath49 and the commutation rules of the dirac matrices , we can simplify the trace term as @xmath50 since the levi - civita connection is torsion - free , we can replace the covariant derivative in the last summand in ( [ eq:9b ] ) by a partial derivative .",
    "we thus conclude that @xmath51 ( @xmath52 denotes as usual the determinant of the lorentzian metric ) .",
    "this formula for @xmath17 is particularly convenient , because it only involves partial derivatives , so that it becomes unnecessary to compute the christoffel symbols of the levi - civita connection .",
    "next , we substitute the derived formulas for @xmath18 and @xmath17 into ( [ eq:1 ] ) and obtain for the dirac operator @xmath53 the four - component wave function @xmath54 of a dirac particle is a solution of the dirac equation @xmath55    for @xmath56 , the kerr - newman metric goes over to the spherically symmetric reissner - nordstrm metric . before going on ,",
    "we explain how one can recover the dirac operator of  @xcite in this limit : first of all , in @xcite the dirac ( and not the weyl ) representation of the dirac matrices is used .",
    "furthermore , instead of working with orthonormal frames , the dirac matrices are constructed in @xcite by multiplying the dirac matrices of minkowski space in polar coordinates @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 with appropriate scalar functions .",
    "because of these differences , the operator @xmath61 obtained from ( [ eq:16 ] ) in the limit @xmath56 coincides with the dirac operators @xmath62 in @xcite only up to a unitary transformation .",
    "more precisely , we have , in the notation of @xcite , @xmath63 we point out that the unitary transformation @xmath64 is not continuous , as it changes sign along the line @xmath65 . since in the limit of flat minkowski space , @xmath66 goes over to the usual dirac operator in the dirac representation , it is natural to assume ( as in  @xcite ) that the dirac wave function @xmath67 corresponding to @xmath62 is continuous ( or even smooth away from the poles @xmath68 ) .",
    "according to the above transformation of the dirac operators , the wave function @xmath54 in ( [ eq:29a ] ) is given by @xmath69 , and we conclude that it must satisfy the boundary conditions @xmath70 as a consequence , we must for the eigenvalues of the angular operator @xmath71 consider half odd integer eigenvalues ( cf .",
    "( [ eq:16a ] ) below ) .",
    "it is a remarkable fact that the dirac equation  ( [ eq:29a ] ) can be completely separated into ordinary differential equations .",
    "this was first shown for the kerr metric by chandrasekhar @xcite , and was later generalized to the kerr - newman background @xcite .",
    "we shall now briefly recall how this is done , since we will need the explicit form of the corresponding ordinary differential operators for the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] .",
    "we closely follow the procedure in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath72 and @xmath73 be the diagonal matrices in the definition of @xmath74 .",
    "our transformation simplifies the radial dirac equation ; moreover , it will make the form of our matching conditions easier . ]",
    "@xmath75 then the transformed wave function @xmath76 satisfies the dirac equation @xmath77 this transformation is useful because the differential operator ( [ eq:11 ] ) can be written as a sum of an operator @xmath78 , which depends only on the radius @xmath79 , and an operator @xmath80 , which depends only on the angular variable @xmath81 .",

    "the regularity of the eigenfunctions of the angular operator @xmath99 for general @xmath4 is established in the appendix .",
    "let us consider the dirac wave function @xmath100 with @xmath85 according to the ansatz ( [ eq:16a]),([eq:16b ] ) .",
    "then the dirac equation ( [ eq:29a ] ) separately describes the wave function in the three regions @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 ; for clarity , we denote @xmath54 in these three regions by @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 , respectively . since the odes ( [ eq:21a]),([eq:21b ] ) and the transformation @xmath107 are regular for @xmath108 , the functions @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 are smooth",
    "however , the difficulty is that the coefficients in the dirac equation have poles at @xmath109 and @xmath110 . as a consequence ,",
    "the dirac wave function will in general be singular for @xmath111 .",
    "furthermore , is not clear how to treat the dirac equation across the horizons . in this section",
    ", we shall derive _ matching conditions _ which relate the wave functions inside and outside each horizon .",
    "for the derivation , we shall first remove the singularities of the metric on the horizons by transforming to kerr coordinates . in these coordinates",
    ", we can also arrange that the dirac operator is regular .",
    "this will allow us to derive a weak solution of the dirac equation valid across the cauchy and event horizons .",
    "in the end , we will transform the derived conditions back to boyer - lindquist coordinates .",
    "first , we must choose coordinate systems where the metric becomes regular on the horizons .",
    "one possibility is to go over to the kerr coordinates @xmath112 given in infinitesimal form by @xcite @xmath113 alternatively , we can choose the coordinates @xmath114 with @xmath115 the variables @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the incoming and outgoing null coordinates , respectively .",
    "along the lines @xmath118 , the variables @xmath119 and @xmath79 are related to each other by @xmath120 by integration , we see that , for @xmath121 , we have @xmath122 . similarly , @xmath123 .",
    "the fact that @xmath119 becomes infinite in the limit @xmath124 means that the kerr coordinates describe extensions of the original boyer - lindquist space - time , whereby the cauchy and event horizons have moved to points at infinity .",
    "more precisely , the cauchy horizon corresponds to the points @xmath125 and @xmath126 ; the event horizon is at @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "in other words , the chart @xmath112 extends the boyer - lindquist space - time across the points @xmath129 and @xmath130 , whereas the chart @xmath114 gives an extension across @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "we next work out the transformation of the wave functions from boyer - lindquist to kerr coordinates .",
    "we first consider the chart @xmath112 .",
    "the transformation of the dirac equation consists of a transformation of the space - time coordinates and of the spinors . for clarity , we perform these transformations in two separate steps .",

    "the kerr coordinate charts , one obtains the maximally extended kerr - newman space - time @xcite .",
    "we do not need the details of the maximal extension here ; it suffices to discuss the penrose diagram of figure [ fig1 ] .    abstractly speaking",

    "the kerr coordinates , on the other hand , allow us to describe three adjacent regions of type @xmath184 , @xmath0 , and @xmath185 including the boundaries between them .",
    "when we speak of boyer - lindquist or kerr coordinates in the following , we implicitly mean that adjacent regions of the maximal extension are isometrically mapped to these coordinate charts .",
    "the maximal extension may be too general for a truly physical situation ( if one thinks of a black hole which evolved from a gravitational collapse in the universe , for example , one may want to consider only one asymptotically flat region ) .",

    "we call each region of type @xmath185 which belongs to the physical space - time an _",
    "asymptotic end_. we assume that , in each asymptotic end , a _ time direction _ is given .",

    "we want to consider a _ black hole _ , i.e.  the situation where particles can disappear into the event horizon , but where no matter can emerge from the interior of a horizon .",
    "therefore we assume that @xmath54 is set identically zero in all regions of type @xmath0 which are connected to the asymptotic ends in the past .",
    "the remaining assumptions can be stated most easily in boyer - lindquist coordinates . since the phase of a wave function @xmath54 has no physical significance , when we say that @xmath54 is _ time - periodic with period @xmath189 _ we mean that there is a real parameter @xmath190 such that .",

    "@xmath191 for time - periodic wave functions , we can separate out the time dependence in a discrete fourier series . more precisely , we can write the wave function as a superposition of the form @xmath192 with @xmath193 where the radial and angular functions @xmath194 and @xmath195 satisfy the equations ( [ eq:21a ] ) and ( [ eq:21b ] ) with @xmath196 the index @xmath197 in ( [ eq:22 ] ) labels the eigenvalue of the operator @xmath80 in ( [ eq:17 ] ) ; the set @xmath198 denotes ( for fixed @xmath199 and @xmath200 ) all the possible values of @xmath197 . as shown in the appendix ,",

    "more precisely , we choose for given @xmath211 the one - parameter family of hypersurfaces @xmath212 for a normalized solution @xmath54 of the dirac equation , the integral @xmath213 gives the probability of the particle to be at time @xmath214 in the region outside the ball of the radius @xmath215 around the origin ; this probability must clearly be smaller than one .",
    "therefore we impose for a normalizable solution the condition that , in each asymptotic end , @xmath216    we now begin the non - existence proof by analyzing the wave function in each asymptotic end in boyer - lindquist coordinates .",
    "the following positivity argument shows that each component of the dirac wave function must be normalizable : we average the normalization condition ( [ eq:21x ] ) one period and use the infinite series ( [ eq:22 ] ) to obtain @xmath217 since the plane waves in this formula are integrated over a whole period , we only get a contribution if @xmath218 and @xmath219 . as is shown in the appendix , the @xmath81-integration gives zero unless @xmath220 , and thus the right hand - side of ( [ eq : e1 ] ) reduces to @xmath221 since the scalar product in ( [ eq : e2 ] ) is positive , we conclude that the normalization integral must be finite for each @xmath222 , @xmath223 in this way , we have reduced our problem to the analysis of static solutions of the dirac equation .",

    "our goal in the present section is to prove an analogue of theorem [ thm1 ] for the most general stationary axisymmetric and orthogonally transitive metric in which the dirac equation can be separated into ordinary differential equations by chandrasekhar s procedure or higher .",

    "this procedure will serve us as a guide in formulating the conditions under which the analogue of theorem [ thm1 ] holds for the dirac equation in the metric ( [ casea ] ) .",

    ", we must require that @xmath340 be positive for @xmath338 varying in that bounded interval .",
    "it follows that the roots of @xmath340 must be distinct and that @xmath340 must be positive as @xmath338 varies in the interval bounded by these roots .",
    "this gives the constraints @xmath341 next , we can ensure that the singular behavior of the metric at the roots of @xmath340 is caused by nothing more than the usual angular coordinate singularity at the polar axis by choosing the ignorable coordinates and the remaining parameters appearing in the metric in such a way that the roots of @xmath332 and @xmath340 coincide .",
    "thus , we use our residual freedom to replace @xmath119 by a constant linear combination of @xmath119 and @xmath172 to add the same arbitrary constant to @xmath331 and @xmath332 .",

    "* remark 4.3 ) of the non - existence theorem for normalizable time - periodic solutions of the dirac equation in the reissner - nordstrm background .",
    "we can likewise argue here that the proof of theorem  [ thm2 ] is similar to that of theorem  [ thm1 ] .",
    "indeed , we can see from ( [ eq : eigena ] ) that the separated equations obtained for the metric ( [ axisform ] ) are similar in structure to those obtained in the kerr - newman case .",
    "next , we remark that in view of the assumptions made in theorem 3.1 to ensure the regularity of the metric at the symmetry axis , it follows that the maximal analytic extension of the metric ( [ axisform ] ) will have a conformal diagram similar in structure to the one obtained for the non - extreme kerr - newman metric ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we thus conclude that matching conditions for the spinor fields across the horizons take a form identical to the equations ( [ eq : m1])([eq : m4 ] ) which were obtained for the kerr - newman case .",
    "the key observation is then that the assumption that we made about the zeros of @xmath367 will guarantee that the estimate required to prove the analogue of lemma 2.1 is valid in this more general context .",
    "finally , the regularity of the eigenfunctions of the angular equation is established by the same procedure as in the kerr - newman case , by showing that the angular operator can be viewed as an essentially self - adjoint elliptic operator on the @xmath368-sphere @xmath369 with @xmath370 coefficients .",
    "we conclude by remarking that non - existence theorems similar to theorems  [ thm1 ] and  [ thm2 ] likewise hold true in cases @xmath371 , and @xmath308 .",
    "in this appendix , we will show that all solutions of the angular equation ( [ eq:21b ] ) are regular .",
    "more precisely , we will see that these functions are of class @xmath372 in the open interval @xmath373 and uniformly bounded on the closed interval @xmath374 .",
    "the method is to reduce the problem to an elliptic eigenvalue equation on the 2-sphere , where standard elliptic regularity theory can be applied .",
    "consider the pde @xmath375 for a two - component , complex function @xmath376 , @xmath373 , @xmath377 , with the boundary conditions @xmath378 ( @xmath379 are again the pauli matrices ( [ eq:25a ] ) ) .",
    "with the ansatz @xmath380 the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : a1 ] ) simplifies to ( [ eq:21b ] ) .",
    "thus it suffices to show regularity for the solutions of ( [ eq : a1 ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the coefficients in ( [ eq : a1 ] ) have singularities ( which are not just removable by a coordinate transformation on @xmath369 ) . however , after performing the transformation @xmath381 we obtain for @xmath382 the equation @xmath383 with the smooth operator @xmath384 where @xmath385 and @xmath386 denote the pauli matrices in polar coordinates , @xmath387 note that the transformation @xmath388 is not continuous on @xmath369 , as it changes sign along the line @xmath65 . combined with our above boundary conditions for @xmath389 , we conclude that @xmath382 is a continuous function on @xmath369 .",
