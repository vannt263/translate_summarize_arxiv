    "nonequilibrium properties and dynamics of strongly correlated electron systems are one of the central theoretical challenges , stimulated by the advances of ultrafast spectroscopy techniques and novel results in materials with correlated materials , as well as by the experiments on the fermionic cold atoms .",
    "one of the evident questions is the explanation of ultrafast recombination of photoinduced charges , as established in the pump - probe experiments on various materials belonging to the class of mott - hubbard ( mh ) insulators .",
    "the prominent example are undoped two - dimensional ( 2d ) cuprates la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 ( lco ) and nd@xmath0cuo@xmath1 ( nco ) , representing the reference substances for the hole - doped and electron - doped high-@xmath2 superconductors , respectively .",
    "the femtosecond pump - probe spectroscopy @xcite reveals that pump pulses with photon energies above the mh gap @xmath3 generate mobile charges , recombining in the picosecond range .",
    "this scale is many orders of magnitude shorter than in clean band insulators and semiconductors with similar gaps @xcite .",
    "photoexcited carriers in the mh insulators are in comparison to bosonic spin and phonon excitations a high - energy excitation far from equilibrium .",
    "therefore the charge recombination process in a clean system requires an instantaneous emission of the energy @xmath4 , which demands creation of many low - energy excitations , limiting the decay rate .",
    "the evident low - energy candidates in 2d cuprates are spin excitations with the characteristic spin exchange scale @xmath5 , since as the consequence of strong correlations the effective charge - spin coupling is inherently strong , and also larger than the characteristic phonon energies @xmath6 . similar questions extend to other mh materials , e.g. to the class of one - dimensional ( 1d ) organic insulators where",
    "an ultrafast decay of photoinduced carriers was observed as well @xcite .",
    "closely related is the challenge of fermionic cold atoms in optical lattices where near the half - filled case the double - occupancy decay is somewhat faster @xcite , yet still requires many scattering processes .",
    "theoretical analysis of strongly correlated electron systems far from equilibrium requires novel concepts and methods due to the failure of quasiparticle picture and boltzmann - type approaches standard for metals and semiconductors .",
    "the relevant charge excitations in mh insulators , at least within the simplest prototype single - band hubbard model , are empty sites - holons and doubly occupied sites - doublons . at low holon - doublon densities",
    "latter excitations bear some resemblance to the holes and electron quasiparticles in semiconductors : a ) they are oppositely charged relative to the reference insulator , b ) they are well mobile with an effective band dispersion within the lower and upper hubbard band , respectively , and c ) they can form a bound excitonic - like state , i.e. a holon - doublon ( hd ) exciton . on the other hand , unlike in a pure semiconductor a single hd pair ( neglecting the coupling to phonon degrees of freedom ) is not an eigenstate and has an intrinsic recombination rate @xmath7 .    the problem of doublon decay has been addressed in the fermi - hubbard model in connection with ultracold fermions in optical lattices @xcite using the diagrammatic approach revealing an exponential dependence of the decay rate on the mh onsite repulsion @xmath8 . since in the latter case charge densities",
    "are quite high , the dominant mechanism relies on energy transfer to the kinetic energy of other fermions .",
    "the decay of double occupancy was considered also within the excited half - filled hubbard model via the time - dependent single - site dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite , for review see @xcite , confirming similar @xmath9 dependence that suggests the same recombination mechanism .",
    "one should note that besides being at rather high effective temperatures @xmath10 , by construction the dmft method does not incorporate non - local spin fluctuations .",
    "recombination of hd pair into spin excitations at low and high temperatures has already been addressed within the @xmath11th order perturbation theory@xcite . however , possible correlations between holon and doublon , i.e. the hd binding ( an essential ingredient of our work ) were neglected , since the prime interest was actually the decay of unpaired fermions in attractive hubbard model .    considering the case of finite photoexcited hd - pair densities @xmath12 the recombination processes could be qualitatively classified in analogy to semiconductors via the density dependence of recombination rates @xmath7 , @xmath13 , into a single exponential one with @xmath14 , bimolecular with @xmath15 and auger processes with @xmath16 .",
    "we elaborate in this paper the charge - recombination scenario @xcite relevant for undoped cuprates lco and nco , but also more generally for 2d mh insulators with a pronounced role of spin - fluctuation excitations .",
    "an important message from pump - probe experiments on those insulating cuprates @xcite is that is at least for modest pump fluences ( pump intensity ) the photoinduced charges ( holons and doublons ) , measured via the probe broad - band optical pulse , decay exponentially after a very fast transient in the femtosecond range .",
    "the long - time decay rate in the picosecond range is fluence independent , i.e. independent on the initial pump intensity and corresponding initial charge density .",
    "this excludes the interpretation in terms of bimolecular and auger processes , and leaves the option with an intermediate stage of bound hd pairs - excitons , which decay exponentially with a well defined rate .",
    "relating back to the experiments , the initial fast transient should describe the relaxation of highly excited holons and doublons that end up in a bound hd exciton , but this is beyond our present study .",
    "the existence of a bound mh exciton with the @xmath17 orbital symmetry has been shown within the planar hubbard model that was for holons and doublons effectively reduced to 2d @xmath18-@xmath5 model @xcite .",
    "due to its symmetry , exciton is not directly observable by optical absorption , but is consistent with the experimental evidence of nonlinear optical susceptibility in lco @xcite , as well as a large raman shift @xcite .    in a strongly correlated system",
    "the mh exciton is not an eigenstate of the system and can decay - recombine via the emission of spin fluctuations @xcite with the characteristic boson scale @xmath5 .",
    "our first theoretical goal is to derive a proper perturbation term governing the decay .",
    "while in the initial study we start with the canonical transformation of the single - band hubbard model , @xcite undoped cuprates are known to be charge - transfer mh insulators . in the following we show that the effective hd recombination term emerging from a more complete multi - band model of cuprates is even quantitatively similar to the one derived from the single - band model .",
    "the hd exciton decay with the emission of a large number @xmath19 of spin fluctuations is an involved many - body problem .",
    "we calculate the recombination rate @xmath7 within the fermi golden rule ( fgr ) approach , which still requires a numerical evaluation on a small - size system .",
    "since our results are obtained on systems with limited size this implicitly shows that long - range antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order is not essential for the decay , and that energy can be transmitted to general paramagnon excitations as long as short - range afm spin correlations are present .",
    "fgr result can be quite well verified via a direct time evolution of the hd exciton decay when the perturbation term is switched on .",
    "quite generally @xmath7 is well described with an exponential dependence @xmath20 obtained also by @xmath11th order perturbation theory arguments @xcite when considering the decay of unbound charged particles . since @xmath21 involves parameters of the model it is crucial for a fast recombination that within a mh insulator we find @xmath22 , being a consequence of the strong charge - spin coupling . while one can not treat the effective hd model analytically , we show that there is a very helpful analogy with an exactly solvable exciton - boson ( toy ) model which confirms the form eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) , and moreover allows direct interpretation of parameters , in particular @xmath21 .",
    "the final goal of this study is the comparison with experimentally measured recombination rates in undoped cuprates nco and lco , and despite the fact that we propose only the minimal model for such process , obtained results are fairly close to the experimentally established ones@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the derivation of the effective model from a single - band hubbard model via the canonical transformation .",
    "an analogous procedure is applied in sec .",
    "iii to the three - band charge - transfer model as directly relevant for undoped cuprates . based on the existence of the bound hd exciton within the 2d effective model on a square lattice as established earlier , @xcite we concentrate in sec .",
    "iv on the calculation of recombination rate @xmath7 within the fgr approximation and on the comparison obtained with the direct time evolution . in sec .",
    "v we present a toy exciton - boson model within which decay rate @xmath7 can be evaluated exactly and even expressed analytically in the form analogous to eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "we start with the prototype model for the studies of the mh insulator - the single - band hubbard model , @xmath23 where sum runs over nearest - neighbor ( nn ) pairs of sites @xmath24 . for the undoped cuprates the relevant lattice is 2d square lattice , which we will consider further on .",
    "we are interested in the half - filled case , @xmath25 , with a low density of holons @xmath26 and doublons @xmath27 .",
    "when discussing the recombination we would like to work with operators causing real , not just virtual transitions . to extract them we perform the usual canonical transformation of hubbard model @xcite that in the lowest order decouples sectors with different number of hd pairs , however still relates them perturbatively .",
    "as shown later on , the transformed hamiltonian in addition to the standard @xmath18-@xmath5 model @xcite contains also the terms causing recombination that were usually neglected in the studies of doped systems . such effective model on one hand serves us to find the initial hd bound state by neglecting the recombination , and then yields its decay by taking it into account .",
