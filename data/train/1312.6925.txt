    "the scissors mode , which is a rotational mode of isovector character in deformed nuclei@xcite , is usually visualized by an out of phase orbital motion of protons against neutrons .",
    "this intuitive picture lead to the prediction of the scissors mode both in terms of nucleonic@xcite and bosonic@xcite degrees of freedom , and has formed the basis of many investigations @xcite . in some respect ,",
    "the scissors mode can be thought of as an extension of the familiar isoscalar collective rotation@xcite to the isovector rotational motion .",
    "indeed , in a recent work @xcite we have used a simple field theory model for the collective orbital motion to show how an effective hamiltonian of the 2-rotor type emerges naturally from the cooperation of the isoscalar ( goldstone ) and isovector ( scissors ) degrees of freedom .    in usual nuclear hamiltonians , the orbital angular momentum alone is not conserved .",
    "a familiar example is the spin - orbit potential , which explicitly breaks the separate spin and orbital symmetries on the level of the mean field hamiltonian .",
    "the explicit breaking of the spin symmetry on the mean field level has important consequences for the properties of nuclear rotational states , and we mention two of them here in more detail : first , if we use the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking to generate a deformed mean field , it is the _ total _ angular momentum symmetry which will be restored by the collective rotation of the whole system .",
    "that is , the isoscalar goldstone modes are generated essentially by the total angular momentum @xmath0 , and their degrees of freedom will lead to an effective rotational hamiltonian of the schematic form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the total moment of inertia .",
    "in analogy to the situation found for the pure orbital case@xcite , we can then anticipate the existence of a mode at low excitation energy , which is generated by the isovector combination of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and which cooperates with the goldstone mode so as to give a total effective rotational hamiltonian of the schematic 2-rotor form @xmath5 .",
    "the structure of the goldstone and scissors modes can therefore be expected to come out similar to the case of the pure orbital motion , but with the orbital angular momenta replaced by the total angular momenta .",
    "second , the explicit breaking of the spin symmetry on the mean field level leads to new types of correlation functions , because the spin operators ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) can generate particle - hole states of finite excitation energy .",
    "these new types of non - interacting correlators , which are visualized by the bubble graphs shown by fig . 2 of the next section with one of the external operators being a spin operator , will obviously modify the sum rules , because the latter ones can be represented in terms of correlation functions@xcite .",
    "in particular , we will see that the presence of these correlators implies that the spin part of the m1 operator can couple to the low energy scissors modes .",
    "this observation is of particular interest , because it is known that there exists a discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental values of the inverse energy weighted m1 sum rule , for which the low energy scissors mode is expected to give the dominant contribution@xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to consider a `` minimal model '' to get analytic insight into the role of the spin for the low energy rotational states in deformed nuclei . by `` minimal '' we mean that the spin dependence of the nuclear hamiltonian is taken into account only via the one - body spin - orbit potential , and not via the two - body interactions . besides simplicity",
    ", the reason to restrict ourselves to this `` minimal model '' is to keep the discussions distinct from the collective spin modes at higher energies , which are known to be strongly modified by interactions of the spin - spin type@xcite . in order to concentrate on the important role of the spin - orbit potential",
    ", we also will not include the effects of pairing correlations in this paper .",
    "the role of spin dependent interactions and pairing correlations for the m1 sum rules will be discussed in a separate work@xcite .    in sect .",
    "ii we will briefly explain the model and the approximations ( mean field approximation and random phase approximation ( rpa ) ) . in sect .",
    "iii we will explain the constraints which follow from angular momentum conservation , and in sect . iv we will discuss the m1 sum rules , with a special emphasis on the role of the spin in the inverse energy weighted ( iew ) sum rule .",
    "v gives a summary of our results .",
    "more formal discussions and derivations are presented in four appendices .",
    "our model is based on the simple quadrupole - quadrupole ( @xmath8 ) interaction , which we used in our earlier work@xcite to describe the pure orbital collective motion . because the mean field approximation and rpa for this model are discussed in detail in that paper",
    ", we only summarize the main points here .",
    "the one - body part of the hamiltonian contains a spherical mean field @xmath9 , which we will not need to specify , and a spin - orbit interaction of the simplest possible form from ( see eq.([h0 ] ) below ) .",
    "the two - body interaction , which we need to describe the collective rotational states , is of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes protons ( @xmath12 ) and neutrons ( @xmath13 ) , and for the coupling constants we assume @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the quadrupole operator is defined by @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "because the spin - orbit potential breaks the spin symmetry explicitly from the outset , the hamiltonian is only invariant under rotations generated by the total angular momentum @xmath18 .",
    "the assumption that the @xmath19 component of the quadrupole operator has a finite ground - state expectation value @xmath20 leads to spontaneous breaking of the rotational symmetry down to rotations generated by @xmath21 .",
    "the first term in ( [ mfa ] ) expresses a deformed mean field for protons and neutrons , and the dots in the second term denote normal ordering . by requiring self consistency for the strength of the deformed mean fields ,",
    "one finally arrives at the following form of the hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath22 where the one - body parts are given by @xmath23 and @xmath24 is a constant given by @xmath25 the parameters @xmath26 in ( [ h0 ] ) represent the strength of the spin - orbit potential .",
    "the deformation parameters @xmath27 obey the self consistency relations @xmath28 where the parameters @xmath29 , which describe the explicit breaking of the rotational symmetry via a term @xmath30 in the hamiltonian , are introduced only for technical reasons and will be set to zero in all final results .",
    "the excitation energies and wave functions of the collective states of the system are determined by the poles and the residues of particle - hole t - matrix , which is a solution of the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation , or equivalently the rpa equation . because we are assuming axial symmetry",

    "the arguments are very similar to those given in ref.@xcite , and we briefly summarize the main points here .",

    "<S> background : : :    the scissors mode is a rotational mode of isovector character in    deformed nuclei . together with the isoscalar rotation , it is the    prominent collective mode at low excitation energies . </S>",
    "<S> purpose : : :    we use a simple field theory model to investigate the role of the    nucleon spin for the magnetic sum rules associated with the low - lying    scissors mode . </S>",
    "<S> special emphasis is put on the coupling of the spin    part of the m1 operator to the scissors mode . </S>",
    "<S> methods : : :    we apply the mean field approximation and random phase approximation    ( rpa ) to a model hamiltonian based on a simple quadrupole - quadrupole    interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the spin - orbit interaction are included in    the mean field hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> ward - takahashi relations are used to    derive the m1 sum rules . </S>",
    "<S> results : : :    the presence of the spin - orbit interaction leads to interference terms    in the inverse energy weighted sum rule . it is shown that the    low - lying scissors mode , which is generated by the isovector    combination of proton and neutron total angular momenta , gives the    main contribution to the spectral sum for this case . conclusions : : :    the basic concept of the scissors mode as an isovector vibrational    rotation remains valid in the presence of the nucleon spin . the    inverse energy weighted sum rule , however , receives non - trivial    modifications because of interference terms . </S>"
