    "this year was declared by the unesco the international year of physics due to the seminal contributions made a century ago by einstein to the modern understanding of nature .",
    "the legacy of einstein not only resides on his successful ideas , he has also been influential through of its apparent mistakes .",
    "his `` biggest blunder , '' as he called it , was the introduction of a cosmological constant .",
    "however , our view on this subject is different today where the applications of the ideas related with the cosmological term rank from quantum field theory to cosmology , and from black holes to holographic proposals of quantum gravity , just for citing a few examples .    in this work",
    "we shall concentrate in other no - less - important application : the propagation of gravitational waves in presence of a cosmological constant .",
    "the pioneering studies on this subject started with the work of garca and plebaski @xcite followed by references @xcite .",
    "they generalized the kundt and robinson - trautman vacuum gravitational waves @xcite to the case where the cosmological constant is different from zero ( for a review , see ref .",
    "the spacetimes introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite are algebraically special and contain an interesting symmetrical class where the multiple principal null direction @xmath0 , corresponding to their weyl tensor , is additionally a killing vector .",
    "this class is diffeomorphic to the so - called siklos spacetimes @xcite , which require a negative cosmological constant .    in @xmath1-dimensions",
    "the siklos spacetimes can be defined by the following conformal transformation of a _ pp _ wave background @xmath2 , \\label{eq : adswave}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 ranges from @xmath4 to @xmath5 . here",
    "the null killing field is given by @xmath6 .",
    "note that in four dimensions , the only einstein spaces conformally related to a _ pp _ wave geometry with a smooth function @xmath7 are characterized by the above metric @xcite . for a vanishing structural function @xmath8 , we recover the anti - de  sitter space metric , while for @xmath9 this metric describes just a perturbation of ads .",
    "in fact , the metric ( [ eq : adswave ] ) can also be obtained from the ads one by a generalized kerr - schild transformation @xmath10 in an analogous way than _ pp _ wave backgrounds are obtained from flat metric by a standard kerr - schild transformation .",
    "hence , the ads waves are to ads space what _ pp _ waves are to minkowski space . for a more precise interpretation of the siklos spacetimes as exact gravitational waves propagating on ads space , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the wave fronts of these ads waves , defined by the @xmath11-surfaces @xmath12 , are given by hyperboloids with constant curvature proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "additionally , the null killing field @xmath14 is geodesic but is not covariantly constant or parallel .",
    "consequently , the ads waves are neither _ plane _ fronted nor have _ parallel _ rays as their cousin configurations the _ pp _ waves .",
    "for this reason we find misleading the term `` ads _",
    "waves '' commonly used in the recent literature to characterize the gravitational fields ( [ eq : adswave ] ) , and instead we will refer to them as `` ads waves '' throughout this paper .",
    "this term is also inaccurate since in general the siklos spacetimes are not the only exact gravitational waves propagating on the ads background , but we find less harmful to use vague terminology in comparison to use an incorrect one .",
    "in this paper we are interested in lower dimensional configurations .",
    "for @xmath15 , which is the case of our interest , the metric form of the ads waves ( [ eq : adswave ] ) is preserved under the following coordinate transformations @xmath16 together with the redefinition of the structural function @xmath17 here @xmath18 and @xmath19 are two arbitrary functions of the retarded time , and the coefficient @xmath20 is defined by the equation @xmath21 the above transformations are the @xmath22-dimensional version of those found by siklos in @xmath23-dimensions @xcite .",
    "they are behind of the conformal asymptotic symmetry observed in asymptotically @xmath24 spacetimes @xcite , and can be generalized to @xmath1-dimensions and associated to a central extension of the virasoro symmetry @xcite .",
    "it follows from the previous transformations that , for a general function @xmath7 , any quadratic and zeroth order dependence on the wave - front coordinate @xmath25 can be locally eliminated by a coordinate transformation . indeed , for a given quadratic coefficient @xmath26 we just need to insert it in the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : f2 ] ) and to impose that the function @xmath27 in the coordinate transformation ( [ eq : formi ] ) satisfies the resulting differential equation .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the two spacetimes related by the above procedure are only equivalent at the local level , since their corresponding global behavior could be drastically different ; in general the new coordinates in transformation ( [ eq : formi ] ) run over ranges which are different from the ranges of the starting coordinates .",
    "this remark is of exceptional transcendence in @xmath28 dimensions and is one of the lessons exhibited by the discovery of the btz black hole @xcite , i.e.  the physically meaning vacuum configuration in @xmath28 gravity is just a proper identification of @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "however , in this work we just concentrate on local issues and the consequences of the diverse global behaviors of the ads waves presented here , in spite of being an interesting topic by itself , is beyond the scope of the present paper .    in vacuum",
    "@xmath28 ads gravity , the resulting ads waves are trivial in the sense that they can be cast as @xmath24 spaces using the above coordinate transformations .",
    "this in turn imply that a matter source must be introduced in order to support these configurations . in this work , we show that a nonminimally coupled scalar field presents many interesting features to be considered as a source .",
    "moreover , this work is a natural extension of previous ones where the same kind of matter is nonminimally coupled to",
    "waves but where the presence of a cosmological constant is generically forbidden @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we derive the independent field equations governing the generation of ads waves by nonminimally coupled scalar fields .",
    "this self - gravitating process is possible only if the scalar field is constrained by the fact that all its energy - momentum components vanish except the energy density along the retarded time , i.e.  the scalar field must behave like a pure radiation field . in sec .",
    "[ sec : u ] , we show that the resulting _ pure radiations constraints _ uniquely determine the scalar configuration , not only by fixing the dependence of the field but also by selecting a unique self - interaction potential for any value of the nonminimal coupling parameter @xmath29 .",
    "this potential depends on a single coupling constant @xmath30 , and for @xmath31 it becomes a mass term .",
    "the related free configurations , studied in sec .  [ sec : free ] , are characterized by the unusual feature that their mass is fixed by the nonminimal coupling parameter . this section is divided in two parts where in the first subsection [ subsec : m<>0 ] we determine the ads waves corresponding to generic values of the nonminimal coupling parameter .",
    "the second subsection [ subsec : m=0 ] is deserved to the study of the massless cases , which correspond to the minimal coupling ( @xmath32 ) , and the conformal couplings in three ( @xmath33 ) and four ( @xmath34 ) dimensions . due to the nonminimal coupling to gravity",
    "only the minimal case @xmath32 describes a genuinely massless field on these curved backgrounds while for @xmath33 and @xmath34 the mass acquires a tachyonic contribution due to the negative scalar curvature . for the specific value @xmath35 , this tachyonic contribution",
    "is exactly canceled out and consequently the scalar field becomes a genuinely massless field on a curved background . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lamb<>0 ] , we analyze the case where the scalar field is self - interacting ( @xmath36 ) taking as explicit example the conformal coupling @xmath33 . in this section",
    "we derive the related ads wave configuration and show that this later consistently reduces to the free configuration as the coupling constant @xmath30 is put to zero . in fact , the background corresponds to a double kerr - schild transformation of ads , where the first transformation is just the free field contribution and the other one depends on the self - interaction .",
    "additionally , we found a critical value of the coupling constant given by @xmath37 , for which a non - perturbative effect relating the strong and weak regimes of the sources appears .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : adsw / ppw ] we establish a correspondence between the ads wave scalar field configurations and those supporting a _ pp _ wave .",
    "it is shown that , starting from a _ pp _ wave scalar source , i.e.  the scalar field and the potential which satisfy the pure radiation constraints on the _ pp _ wave background , one can generate the ads wave source and _ vice et versa_. the appendix is devoted to the free case , when the ads waves are ruled by topologically massive gravity with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "conformal gravity configurations are also obtained as a zero topological mass limit of these configurations .",
    "in this work we are concerned with scalar fields nonminimally coupled to an ads wave background .",
    "the field equations are those arising from the variation of the following action @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the negative cosmological constant and @xmath29 is the parameter allowing a nonminimal coupling to gravity of the scalar field @xmath40 .",
    "the potential @xmath41 denotes a possible self - interaction whose form , as we shall see later , is dictated by the field equations .",
    "the variation of the above action with respect to the metric and the scalar field yield to the einstein and the nonlinear klein - gordon equations , respectively , @xmath42 @xmath43 where the energy - momentum tensor is defined by @xmath44    a distinctive feature of an ads wave lies in the fact that its einstein tensor has the following structure @xmath45 which in turn implies that any self - gravitating source supporting the wave in the presence of the negative cosmological constant must behave effectively as a pure radiation field @xcite . as a direct consequence , in the coordinates of metric ( [ eq : adswave ] ) , the only component of the einstein equations with a nonvanishing left - hand side is the one along @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the remaining einstein equations reduce to the vanishing of the related energy - momentum tensor components . in",
    "what follows , we refer to these last conditions as the _ pure radiation constraints_.    in the present case , we assume that the null killing field @xmath6 is also a symmetry of the scalar field , i.e.  @xmath47 . the independent field equations on the ads wave background ( [ eq : adswave ] ) are written using the following combinations : the equation along the @xmath48component is given by @xmath49 while the pure radiation constrains read    [ eq : prc ] @xmath50=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the nonlinear klein - gordon equation ( [ eq : kg ] ) reduces in this case to @xmath51 note that since the conservation equations of the energy - momentum tensor only involve the components given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : prc ] ) , the fulfillment of the pure radiation constraints guarantee that the equation ( [ eq : kgadsw ] ) is automatically satisfied .",
    "> from these equations , it is easy to show the necessity of introducing a matter source . indeed in the vacuum case ,",
    "i.e. @xmath52 , the resulting structural function would be given by @xmath53 and using the coordinate transformation ( [ eq : formi ] ) , one can fix @xmath8 , and obtaining the metric of ads .",
    "here , we explore the possibility of having a self - interacting nonminimally coupled ( @xmath54 ) scalar field acting as a source of an ads wave background . as we shall see , the pure radiation constraints single out the form of the self - interaction potential as it was also the case in the _ pp _ wave context @xcite .",
    "in order to derive the allowed potential , it is useful to redefine the scalar field as follows deserves a different analysis which is done at the end of this section . ]",
    "@xmath55 with this redefinition the pure radiation constraints ( [ eq : uy ] ) and ( [ eq : uv+yy ] ) are rewritten as    [ eq : s_yyuy ] @xmath56    whose integration yields to @xmath57 where @xmath30 is a positive constant and @xmath58 is a general function of the retarded time . using the expressions ( [ eq : phi2sigma ] ) and ( [ eq : subssigma ] ) it is possible to rewrite the remaining pure radiation constraint ( [ eq : yy ] ) only in terms of the scalar field .",
    "this procedure fixes the self - interaction potential to be given by @xmath59    various comments can be made concerning the structure of this potential .",
    "firstly , for the three - dimensional conformal coupling @xmath33 , this potential reduces to the conformal one in three dimensions . secondly , at the vanishing cosmological constant limit ( @xmath60 ) , we recover the potential allowing a self - interacting scalar field to be nonminimally coupled to a _",
    "pp _ wave background @xcite .",
    "finally , it is intriguing that this potential belongs to the same family of potentials arising in the context of scalar fields nonminimally coupled to special geometries without inducing backreaction ( the static btz black hole @xcite , flat space @xcite , and the generalized ( a)ds spacetimes @xcite ) .",
    "instead , all them has the common feature that they allow the existence of nontrivial solutions with a vanishing energy - momentum tensor called  stealth \" configurations .",
    "we would like to remark that the scalar field configurations given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phi2sigma ] ) and ( [ eq : subssigma ] ) solve the nonlinear klein - gordon equation ( [ eq : kgadsw ] ) with a self - interaction potential given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : u(phi ) ] ) on any ads wave background . in other words",
    ", this means that the scalar field and the allowed potential are not sensitive to the structural function @xmath7 of the metric ( [ eq : adswave ] ) .",
    "we now derive the self - interaction allowed by the nonminimal coupling value @xmath61 . in this case",
    "we redefine the scalar field as @xmath62 and the pure radiation constraints ( [ eq : uy ] ) and ( [ eq : uv+yy ] ) reduce again to the equations ( [ eq : s_yyuy ] ) .",
    "hence , we conclude that the solution is given by expression ( [ eq : subssigma ] ) , while the remaining pure radiation constraint ( [ eq : yy ] ) gives rise to the following potential @xmath63 ^ 2 - 1\\right\\}.\\ ] ]    for any value of the nonminimal coupling parameter , we have derived the allowed potential . in the next section ,",
    "we explore the existence of free configurations which are obtained by imposing some appropriated restrictions on the potential ( [ eq : u(phi ) ] ) .",
    "as shown before , the radiative constraints single out the form of the potential . for a generic value of the nonminimal coupling parameter and for a vanishing coupling constant @xmath31 , the potential ( [ eq : u(phi ) ] ) becomes a mass term and hence , the scalar fields can be interpreted as free massive ( or massless ) fields .",
    "this argument is not valid for @xmath61 since in this case the corresponding potential ( [ eq : u1/4(phi ) ] ) does not allow the existence of free fields .",
    "for a zero coupling constant @xmath31 , the potential ( [ eq : u(phi ) ] ) reduces to a mass term given by @xmath64 with a mass parameterized in terms of the nonminimal coupling parameter as @xmath65 it is easy to see that in the minimal case @xmath32 , and for the three - dimensional ( resp .",
    "four - dimensional ) conformal coupling parameter , @xmath33 ( resp .",
    "@xmath34 ) , this mass vanishes and their related massless configurations will be analyzed in the next subsection .",
    "on the other hand , the above mass generated by the nonminimal coupling allows the existence of tachyonic solutions for negative values of the nonminimal coupling parameter and for @xmath66 , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] .",
    "the solid graph shows the dependence of the square of the scalar field mass @xmath67 on the nonminimal coupling parameter @xmath29 , as fixed by the pure radiation constraints .",
    "the dotted graph corresponds to the dependence of the square of the effective mass @xmath68 , obtained when the contribution of the curvature is taken into account , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : me^2 ] ) .",
    "the graphs are valid for @xmath69 . the dependence for @xmath70 is not shown in the graph but it is positive definite in both cases.,width=321 ]    for the nonminimal couplings associated with a nonvanishing mass the corresponding massive scalar field satisfying the pure radiation constraints is given by @xmath71 where we have rescaled appropriately the retarded - time - dependent function @xmath27 to be dimensionless .",
    "next , in order to determine the ads wave supported by this massive field , we need to solve the einstein equation ( [ eq : uu - uv ] ) . in this case , this equation can be rewritten as the following hypergeometric differential equation @xmath72 after making the transformations    [ eq : xh2yf ] @xmath73    the general solution of equation ( [ eq : hypergeomde ] ) reads @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are two undetermined functions of the retarded time and @xmath77 stands for the hypergeometric function @xcite . in terms of the original variables it is possible to apply the coordinate transformation ( [ eq : formi ] ) which is equivalent to fix @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "hence , the ads waves supported by massive scalar fields , with a mass ( [ eq : m^2 ] ) generated by the nonminimal coupling , are given by    [ eq : solm ] @xmath80,\\qquad~\\\\ \\label{eq : phifree } \\phi&=&\\frac1{\\sqrt{\\kappa } } \\left(\\frac{y}{l}\\right)^{2\\xi/(1 - 4\\xi)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the function @xmath76 has been properly rescaled .",
    "note that the above class of ads wave configurations is not well - defined for the nonminimal coupling values @xmath81 since the representation of the hypergeometric function in terms of the gauss series is singular for these couplings .",
    "the value @xmath82 which corresponds to an infinite nonminimal coupling parameter ( or equivalently to an infinite mass ) is excluded in what follows . for the remaining values",
    "@xmath83 the mass is given by @xmath84 and the associated solution of eq .",

    "in fact for @xmath32 , it follows from the pure radiation constraints ( [ eq : uv+yy ] ) and ( [ eq : yy ] ) , that the theory can not accommodate a potential .",
    "moreover , the corresponding free massless scalar field only depends arbitrarily on the retarded time , @xmath88 . in this case , the remaining independent einstein equation ( [ eq : uu - uv ] ) reduces to the three - dimensional inhomogeneous siklos equation @xcite for which the inhomogeneity is dictated by the scalar source , @xmath89 this equation is easily integrated as @xmath90y^2 + f_0(u),\\ ] ] where @xmath75 and @xmath91 denote two undetermined functions of the retarded time .",
    "we can now use a special version of the coordinate change ( [ eq : formi ] ) to eliminate the pure quadratic and zeroth order dependence on the wave - front coordinate @xmath25 . in order to do that we impose to the function @xmath27 appearing in the coordinate change to satisfy the equation ( [ eq : f2 ] ) with @xmath26 given by @xmath92 this choice is motivated by the fact that , after rescaling the wave - front coordinate , an additional quadratic term appears arising from the logarithmic function . by doing",
    "that , we yield to the following minimally coupled field content    [ eq : minsol ] @xmath93.\\\\ \\phi&=&\\phi(u).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , in the minimal case , the scalar field has a wavy behavior which means that it allows an arbitrary profile in term of the retarded time , and this profile fully determines the profile of the ads wave .",
    "note that this property is also valid in the case of a _ pp _ wave configuration with a minimally coupled scalar field acting as source @xcite .",
    "the introduction of a nonminimal coupling induces drastic changes in comparison with the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite regarding _ pp _ waves supported by free massless fields .",
    "for example , the pure radiation constraints for the ads wave geometry are more restrictive than those for the _ pp _ wave one since for this later there are no restrictions on the nonminimal coupling parameter @xcite . indeed , for the ads waves the other massless configurations (",
    "apart from the minimal one ) are obtained only for the nonminimal couplings @xmath33 and @xmath34 , as it can be concluded from the vanishing of the mass expression ( [ eq : m^2 ] ) .",
    "these two systems are already considered within the general solution ( [ eq : solm ] ) , but they are more easily expressed after fixing the coupling in each case . for the conformal coupling @xmath33 , the solution is given by    [ eq : solm=01/8 ] @xmath94         du^2 - 2dudv+dy^2\\right\\},\\qquad~\\\\ \\phi&=&\\frac1{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}\\sqrt{\\frac{y}{l}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    while for the conformal coupling in four dimensions , @xmath34 , the solution becomes    [ eq : solm=01/6 ] @xmath95,\\qquad~\\\\ \\phi&=&\\frac1{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}\\frac{y}{l}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in contrast with the minimally coupled massless configuration ( [ eq : minsol ] ) , the massless sources ( [ eq : solm=01/8 ] ) and ( [ eq : solm=01/6 ] ) have no wavy behavior .",
    "the reason is due to the presence of the cosmological constant which brings through the curvature an effective mass for any nonminimal coupling ( @xmath96 ) as it can be seen from the klein - gordon equation ( [ eq : kgadsw ] ) . this situation does not occur for the massless scalar fields nonminimally",
    "coupled to _",
    "waves @xcite since in this case the scalar curvature is identically zero .",
    "this last observation motivates the following question : is there exists some specific values of the nonminimal coupling parameter for which the generated mass ( [ eq : m^2 ] ) compensates exactly the contribution of the cosmological constant to the effective mass ? in this case , this would imply that the resulting configuration is a truly free massless field . in order to give an answer to this question , we first define the square of the effective mass as the sum of the generated mass ( [ eq : m^2 ] ) together with the contribution of the scalar curvature , @xmath97 it is clear from this expression that for @xmath35 , which incidentally corresponds to the six - dimensional conformal coupling , the effective mass is zero .",
    "this in turn means that for @xmath35 , the pure radiation constraints allow massive fields which behave effectively as massless scalar fields .",
    "the corresponding fields also belong to the class described by eq .",

    "more intriguing is the fact that the manifestation of the self - interaction arises exactly in a quadratic dependence on the wave - front coordinate @xmath25 . until now , it has always be possible and useful to eliminate locally these contributions by mean of the coordinate transformation ( [ eq : formi ] ) .",

    "note that this correspondence is strictly realized between the sources and not between the involved structural functions , @xmath7 and @xmath128 .",
    "however , in the particular situation of retarded - time - dependent sources , a relation between these structural functions can be derived .",

    "a particularity obviously occurs for the conformal coupling @xmath33 , since in this case one can use the relation ( [ eq : tyy2tbyy ] ) to eliminate the energy - momentum components from the above combinations , yielding to the standard conformal correspondence between the wave equations in this case .",
    "we never have seen a relation like the above in the literature , it has sense only for strictly nonminimal couplings ( @xmath54 ) and gravitational waves backgrounds , but it would be very interesting if there exist other geometries allowing its existence .      in the above treatment we have established a correspondence between the scalar sources supporting a _ pp _ wave and an ads wave .",

    "it appears that there is no relation between the backgrounds in this case .      in the ads wave case and for a generic nonminimal coupling parameter ( @xmath96 ) , the retarded - time - dependent integration functions of the scalar field can always be put equal to some non zero constant by an appropriate coordinate transformation . in the case of the _ pp _ wave configurations",
    ", the situation is different . indeed , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the arbitrary retarded time dependent functions can only be removed for a self - interacting scalar field . in this case , a suitable shift in the wave - front coordinate @xmath25 allows to remove the integration function @xmath58 from ( [ eq : phi(u , y)pp ] ) leading to the following `` physical '' solution @xmath159    in view of these remarks , it is not clear that the correspondence reported previously is still valid once the undetermined integration functions have been removed .",

    "in fact , using the above expression in the vanishing of eq .",
    "( [ eq : el ] ) one recovers the self - interacting potential ( [ eq : u(phi ) ] ) allowing the ads wave configurations , but with a coupling constant given now by @xmath169 .",
    "this reflects the fact that by construction , the equations determining the ads wave source , namely the pure radiation constraints and the nonlinear klein - gordon equation , are invariant under the rescaling @xmath170 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the scalar contribution to action ( [ eq : action ] ) only change by a multiplicative constant under the above rescaling .",
    "as it was previously anticipated , the free constant @xmath165 corresponds to the nonzero constant remaining in the scalar field once the retarded - time - dependent integration function is removed .",
    "it can be fixed appropriately using the transformations ( [ eq : formi ] ) , as it has been explicitly shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : lamb<>0 ] .",
    "for @xmath171 the present correspondence is analog to the correspondence established in the previous subsection , in the sense that it allows to relate the self - interacting configurations on a _ pp _ wave ( i.e.  @xmath133 ) with the self - interacting configurations on an ads wave ( i.e.@xmath172 ) .",
    "the basic difference lies in the fact that the integration functions depending on retarded time are appropriately fixed in each case .",
    "however , for @xmath173 , a new link can be made .",
    "indeed , in this case , the coupling constant in the ads wave side vanishes ( @xmath174 ) and as a consequence , the potential reduces to the mass term given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : m^2p^2 ] ) and ( [ eq : m^2 ] ) .",
    "hence , the free scalar fields on an ads wave ( [ eq : phifree ] ) and the self - interacting scalar fields on a _ pp _ wave ( [ eq : phymi ] ) are effectively related provided the constant @xmath165 to be fixed by @xmath175 in summary , we have generated the free massive and massless configurations ( @xmath31 ) supporting an ads wave from the self - interacting _ pp _ wave configurations ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "in this paper , we have attacked the problem of the generation of exact gravitational waves propagating on ads space .",
    "we have restricted our attention to the three - dimensional case for which a matter source must be necessarily introduced in order to support these ads waves .",
    "the elaboration of this work has opened many interesting questions that go beyond the simple mathematical resolution .",
    "the first interrogation may concern the choice of the matter source for these ads waves . indeed , due to the wave character of these gravitational fields , any matter supporting them must behave as a pure radiation field .",
    "this means that the only nonvanishing component of the energy momentum tensor must be the energy density along the retarded time .",
    "this last fact is certainly very restrictive concerning the possible choices of matter source .",
    "it is interesting to remark that a source given by a scalar field nonminimally coupled to the ads waves , as we have considered here , does not yield to inconsistencies , quite the contrary provides many interesting curiosities that we have reported throughout this paper .",
    "although it is also natural to ask about the motivation of considering such source instead of another plausible one , the appearance of these unexpected curiosities ( essentially due to the inclusion of the nonminimal coupling ) in some sense legitimate our choice . as the first curiosity",
    ", it is intriguing that the integration of the _ pure radiation constraints _ , which are three of the four independent einstein equations , completely fixes the dependence of the scalar field as well as singles out a unique self - interaction potential allowing the existence of ads waves .",
    "in other words , this means that the self - interacting nature of the source is strictly determined from the requirement of being capable of generating ads waves .",
    "we showed that the resulting potential depends only on one coupling constant denoted by @xmath30 and presents various interesting characteristics .",
    "its expression is given by a superposition of different powers of the scalar field whose exponents are expressed in terms of the nonminimal coupling parameter @xmath29 .",
    "for the three - dimensional conformal coupling , i.e.  @xmath33 , the parameterized expression of the potential reduces precisely to the three - dimensional conformal potential @xmath176 .",
    "this in turn implies that the matter source allowed by the ads waves becomes conformally invariant .",
    "it is amusing to note that there is _  priori _ no good reason for the potential to become the conformally invariant one , since the full system does not exhibit the conformal invariance . we would like to remark that this is not the first time that the above nonminimal - coupling related potential appears . in the limit of vanishing cosmological constant @xmath60 the potential becomes the one allowing the existence of scalar - field generated _ pp _ waves derived in ref .",
    "@xcite . additionally , it is a particular case of the family of potentials allowing the existence of gravitationally stealth configurations on special backgrounds as the static btz black hole , flat space , and ( a)ds , see refs .",
    "@xcite .    after determining the scalar source from the pure radiation constraints ,",
    "the integration of the remaining einstein equation permits to find the geometric background .",
    "the simplest case occurs for a vanishing coupling constant @xmath31 , since the potential reduces to a pure mass term with the peculiarity that the corresponding mass @xmath67 is fixed in terms of the nonminimal coupling parameter with a mass scale determined from the cosmological constant .",
    "this last fact increases the interest on the nonminimal coupling parameter @xmath29 whose range now allows the existence of several types of free sources . for example , for @xmath66 or @xmath177 , the ads waves are generated by tachyonic configurations ( @xmath178 ) .",
    "the waves can also be supported by massless fields in the cases of the minimal coupling @xmath32 , the three - dimensional conformal coupling @xmath33 , and the four - dimensional conformal coupling @xmath34 . however , the last two cases do not represent genuinely massless fields in their corresponding curved backgrounds .",
    "this is due to the fact that there is an additional contribution to their mass coming from de nonminimal coupling of the fields to the gravitational waves .",
    "since the ads waves has negative scalar curvature this contribution is tachyonic , as a consequence the fields acquire an effective mass given by @xmath179 on these backgrounds .",
    "the explicit dependence of the effective mass on the nonminimal coupling parameter implies that in the range @xmath180 the scalar fields are forced to behave effectively as tachyonic fields ( @xmath181 ) .",
    "as it can be anticipated from continuity , the genuinely massless states ( @xmath182 ) are not only realized for the minimal coupling @xmath32 but also for the nonminimal coupling value @xmath35 , which incidentally corresponds to the conformal coupling in @xmath183 .",
    "the value @xmath35 is associated to a critical case in the sense that its allowed mass @xmath184 exactly compensates the contribution generated by the negative cosmological constant , this explain why the scalar field becomes a truly massless field in a curved background .",
    "it is true that the matter source is characterized by a unique parameter , namely the nonminimal coupling parameter , but once again there is no good reason for the existence of a critical value of this parameter that renders the scalar field effectively as a massless field .",
    "additionally , the fact that the fine - tuning occurs for the conformal coupling of a higher dimension seems to indicate that the effect can be connected to some more symmetrical higher - dimensional physics .",
    "an interesting work will consist in exploring if this mass annihilating effect can be extended to higher - dimensional versions of the ads waves or to other geometries .",
    "the self - interacting case , i.e.  @xmath149 , has been studied in details for the conformal coupling @xmath33 .",
    "generically , the background have been shown to be a gravitational wave propagating on ads space builds from the superposition of two contributions .",
    "the first one corresponds to the massless free field ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the other contribution is associated with the self - interaction , since it presents a dependence on the coupling constant which goes as @xmath185 . as a consequence , the free configuration is consistently obtained from the self - interacting one in the limit @xmath186 .",
    "this double kerr - schild representation of the background starting from ads space is outstanding , since in spite of the strong self - coupling of the field ( @xmath187 ) its contribution as source is encoded in a very simple way .",
    "this simple connection between the free and the self - interacting cases occurs only if the coupling constant is different from the critical value @xmath37 . for this critical value ,",
    "we have proved that a surprising non - perturbative effect occurs .",
    "we have established a kind of strong - weak duality in the sense that the field strengths @xmath40 and @xmath188 are diffeomorphic and the profile of their corresponding ads waves only differs by a minus sign . in other words the strong regime is locally equivalent to the weak one just by reflecting the profile of the gravitational wave .",
    "these results for the conformal coupling can be generalized to the family of nonminimal coupling values @xmath118 $ ] , @xmath119 , and in the same line as in the conformal case , different critical behaviors can also appear .",
    "another intriguing fact concerns the relation that we have established with the problem of scalar fields nonminimally coupled to a _",
    "pp _ wave .",
    "it is well - known that an ads wave can also be viewed as a conformal transformation of a _ pp _ wave but there is no reason for their matter sources to be also in correspondence . here",
    ", we have shown that the pure radiation constraints of both systems are conformally related when their scalar fields are also conformally related with a conformal weight fixed in terms of the nonminimal coupling parameter .",
    "this conformal correspondence occurs between the scalar sources ( scalar fields and allowed potentials in each case ) but the correspondence can not be extended to the involved backgrounds . in addition , we have shown that a particular combination of the klein - gordon equation together with the wave - front component of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath189 is in fact conformally invariant in the pass from one gravitational wave to the other . in the case of the conformal coupling",
    "this relation becomes the well - known conformal invariance of the conformal klein - gordon equation .",
    "it will be interesting to explore the transcendence of similar conclusions in higher dimensions .",

    "unlike standard @xmath28 gravity , the waves are allowed in the vacuum case .",
    "the negative cosmological constant acts on the gravitational waves by reducing the value of their topological mass , i.e.  if the theory has a topological mass @xmath190 the ads waves have a physical topological mass @xmath191 .",

    "<S> the resulting gravitational wave is formed by the superposition of the free and the self - interaction contributions , except for a critical value of the coupling constant where a non - perturbative effect relating the strong and weak regimes of the source appears . </S>",
    "<S> we establish a correspondence between the scalar source supporting an ads wave and a _ pp _ wave by showing that their respective pure radiation constraints are conformally related , while their involved backgrounds are not . </S>",
