    "the localization and transport of energy in lattices by intrinsic localized modes or discrete breathers , has recently been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental investigation ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "corresponding results on the quantum equivalent of these states are less numerous , c.f .",
    "@xcite for some theoretical results and @xcite for some experimental work .",
    "studies of quantum modes on small lattices are of increasing interest for quantum devices based on quantum dots ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) and for studies of photonic crystals .",
    "we present some results on breather bands in small one dimensional lattices with a small number of quanta .",
    "we study a periodic lattice with @xmath0 sites containing bosons , described by the quantum version of the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnls ) which will be denoted by qdnls .",
    "it has the hamiltonian @xmath1,\\ ] ] which conserves the number of quanta @xmath2 .",
    "this model , also known as the bose - hubbard model , is presently used to investigate cold bosonic atoms in optical lattices @xcite .    assuming that the anharmonic parameter @xmath3 is stronger than the intersite coupling , the eigenvalues of ( [ ham1 ] ) , plotted as a function of the wave number @xmath4 , separate out into distinct bands @xcite .",
    "the eigenstates of each band are dominated by states in which the bosons have clumped together , two or more on one site .",
    "for example , with @xmath5 , the lowest band is , to a good approximation , a linear combination of states with 4 bosons on site @xmath6 and no bosons elsewhere . the next lowest band is mostly composed of states with 3 quanta on one site and another quanta elsewhere . the third band is mostly composed of states with 2 quanta on one site and 2 quanta on a separate site .",
    "we will refer to this band as a @xmath7 band in an obvious notation .",
    "this band is of great interest since it represents the simplest case of a band describing two `` composite '' particles interacting with each other .",
    "our letter is devoted to the fine structure of this and similar bands such as the @xmath8 and @xmath9 bands in the @xmath10 case .",
    "the fine structure of the @xmath7 band , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , shows the eigenvalues ( crosses ) in the @xmath5 case .",
    "detail of the eigenvalue spectrum for the qdnls periodic lattice ( [ ham1 ] ) , @xmath11 . ]",
    "the solid lines show the results of the theoretical calculations ( described below ) in the asymptotic limit @xmath12 .",
    "we stress again that this picture shows only _ one _ of the bands in the @xmath5 spectrum .",
    "its fine detail is revealed as a `` continuum '' band ( in the @xmath12 limit ) , plus a single @xmath4-dependent `` line band '' .",
    "examination of the corresponding eigenvectors shows that the `` line band '' is mostly composed of states where the two sites each with two quanta lie occupy _ adjacent _ sites , whereas in the `` continuum '' band these sites are separated by one or more vacant sites .",
    "the standard qdnls hamiltonian is thermodynamically unstable , i.e. the energy of the ground state goes to @xmath13 as the number of particles goes to @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , some bands can be degenerate with others , for example when @xmath10 , the @xmath9 band overlaps with the @xmath15 band . in some cases it would be convenient for the bands under study to be the lowest energy bands of the system .    for these reasons",
    "we consider also the following generalized qdnls hamiltonian @xmath16 the @xmath17 term is a saturation term which discourages too many bosons occupying the same site .",
    "a similar term appears also in nonlinear optics @xcite and in cold bosonic atoms trapped in optical lattices @xcite where it describes three body interactions . by varying the values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 it is possible to `` shuffle '' the order of bands in the @xmath20 diagram .    at zero coupling ( @xmath21 ) ,",
    "we denote by @xmath22 the respective energies of @xmath23 bosons on the same site , @xmath24 , etc .",
    "thus in the @xmath5 case the @xmath25 band has energy @xmath26 , the @xmath27 band has energy @xmath28 , the @xmath29 band energy @xmath30 , etc .",
    "providing @xmath31 , the bottom of the @xmath29 band is the _ ground state _ of the system .",
    "to describe the components of the quantum states we use a position state representation , where for example the state @xmath32 represents a state with two quanta at the lattice position 2 , two quanta at the lattice position 5 , and zero quanta elsewhere . in view of the periodic nature of the lattice , we can generate an equivalence class of states by applying the translation operator ( with periodic boundary condition ) to one of these states .",
    "we will refer to these classes by ordering them such that the leftmost number is the largest , so for example @xmath33 is shorthand for @xmath34 , etc . for further conciseness we will truncate all trailing zeros , so the above class",
    "becomes @xmath35 .",
    "the set of all the classes containing @xmath36 , etc .",
    "is referred to as the @xmath7 band .",
    "at zero coupling , all the @xmath7 states @xmath37 , @xmath38 are degenerate .",
    "we use degenerate perturbation theory to obtain both eigenvalues and eigenstates for @xmath39 . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we consider an odd number of sites @xmath40 .",
    "bloch waves of @xmath7 states can be written ( in the notation of @xcite ) @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the translation operator , @xmath43 , and the crystal momentum @xmath44 where @xmath45 .    using ( [ blw ] ) and",
    "standard brillouin - wigner perturbation theory up to second order in @xmath46 we obtain @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the hopping term in the hamiltonian , and @xmath49 is any state not in the @xmath7 subspace . @xmath50 is the energy corresponding to @xmath51 in the uncoupled limit ( @xmath21 ) .    it is obvious that the first sum of ( [ eigeq ] ) is zero as @xmath48 does not link any of the @xmath52 to each other . in evaluating the second sum ,",
    "the @xmath53 terms are mostly zero except for the following @xmath54 we now define the matrix @xmath55 by @xmath56 then @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the @xmath59 unity matrix and @xmath60    the structure of the matrix ( [ h2 ] ) is very similar to the two - quanta case described in @xcite .",
    "the first term represents a global shift of the @xmath7-band , whereas the `` impurity '' @xmath61 will in general be responsible for a splitting of the states @xmath37 from the rest of the band ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 , etc . ) . in this respect ,",
    "the @xmath37 s can be seen as `` bound states of doublets '' within the @xmath7-band .",
    "it is separated from the continuum band because in addition to linking with states such as @xmath64 , it also links to states such as @xmath65 .",
    "this explains the @xmath7-band fine structure .    in case",
    "the number of sites tends to infinity , ( [ h2 ] ) may be diagonalised exactly to yield @xmath66    depending on the various values of @xmath67 , and @xmath46 , we can get the line band completely above or below the continuum band , or partially merged with the continuum band .",
    "detail of the eigenvalue spectrum for the generalized qdnls periodic lattice ( [ ham2 ] ) , @xmath68 . ]",
    "fig [ fig2 ] shows a case where the line part is below the continuum part of the @xmath7 band and represents the ground state of the @xmath5 sector .    to provide some insight in the way the two groups of two quanta interact within a @xmath37 state , we compare its effective mass @xmath69 with twice the effective mass @xmath70 of a single @xmath71 state . from @xcite and ,",
    "we obtain @xmath72 as @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( see ) .",
    "depending on the ratio @xmath75 , @xmath61 and thus @xmath69 are either positive or negative . the same phenomenon is observed for bright solitons in systems of bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices for which may be seen as a tight - binding limit ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "as a further example we consider the @xmath10 case . now there are two bands describing an interaction of two anharmonic states : the @xmath8 and the @xmath9 bands .",
    "fig [ fig3 ] shows a @xmath10 , @xmath8 example , again the crosses represent numerically exact solutions in the @xmath76 case , and the lines represent perturbation theory calculations .",
    "detail of the eigenvalue spectrum for the generalized qdnls periodic lattice ( [ ham2 ] ) , @xmath10 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 . ]    in this case we have a `` continuum band '' which shows very weak @xmath4-dependence , plus two `` line bands '' , one above and one below . with other choices of @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    "we can move one or both of the `` line bands '' into the continuum .",
    "fig [ fig4 ] shows the corresponding @xmath9 case .",
    "detail of the eigenvalue spectrum for ( [ ham2 ] ) , @xmath10 , @xmath76 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 . ]    in this case there appears to be only two `` line bands '' , but a closer examination reveals the upper `` line '' is in fact a continuum band with the degeneracy split at an @xmath81 level .      proceeding as in the @xmath7 case , we now obtain @xmath82 where @xmath83 an analysis of the eigenvalues of this matrix in the @xmath84 limit is somewhat messy but explicit results can be found : details will be published elsewhere .",
    "essentially the results depend on whether two rational functions of @xmath85 are less than or greater than 1 in modulus .",
    "this gives the two `` line bands '' in fig [ fig3 ] .",
    "the corresponding eigenstates are essentially symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of the bloch waves made from @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the `` continuum band '' is given by the formula @xmath88+{\\cal     o}\\left({\\epsilon}^3\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath89 .",
    "note that , up to order 2 in @xmath46 , the energies of this band do not depend on the crystal momentum @xmath4 , in accord with the numerical results .      in this case the correction to the zeroth order states",
    "is given by @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 otherwise .",
    "the diagonal matrix ( [ h33 ] ) has an `` impurity '' @xmath61 responsible for a splitting of the states @xmath93 from the rest of the band . in this respect ,",
    "the @xmath93 s can be seen as `` bound states of doublets '' within the @xmath9-band .",
    "note again that none of the elements of the matrix above contains the wave vector @xmath4 . at this order of perturbation theory ,",
    "the bands are then flat .",
    "moreover , the degeneracy of the @xmath94 s ( i.e. two 3-quanta breathers separated by one or more empty sites ) has still not been lifted although it would to next order .",
    "it is possible to generalize the above results to discuss @xmath95 bands when @xmath96 .",
    "the case @xmath97 is similar to the @xmath9 case and the case @xmath98 follows the @xmath8 case discussed above .",
    "details will be given elsewhere .",
    "the results known previously for bound states representing a group of @xmath2 bosons located on the same site @xcite have been extended here to higher order states representing two interacting groups of bosons .",
    "this opens up the possibity of a study of the collision process between these composite particles , that is a quantum breather collision .",
    "a similar study has already been done for the _ continuous _ version of , i.e. the _ integrable _ quantum nonlinear schrdinger equation ( qnse ) , well known in nonlinear optics @xcite and quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "however , the bound states of groups of quanta which we have described here within the @xmath95 bands do not exist in qnse .",
    "their appearence in these _ nonintegrable _ discrete systems is thus expected to affect the collision process between two quantum breathers and to bring new features in comparison to the quantum soliton collisions described in @xcite .",
    "results of this investigation will be reported elsewhere .",
