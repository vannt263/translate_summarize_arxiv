    "is not contained in any other essential circles we can zero out a row for each essential circle .",
    "thus we can zero out exactly @xmath265 rows since the essential circles of @xmath76 are fundamental circles of @xmath258 . since @xmath264 has @xmath266 rows and we can zero out exactly @xmath267 of them to see that the row rank of @xmath264 is @xmath268 .",
    "for @xmath76 to be minimally dependent the nullity of @xmath264 must necessarily be @xmath6 . if the nullity of @xmath264 is @xmath6 , then @xmath76 is minimally dependent since the weak deletion of any non - empty subset of edges of @xmath76 would result in a monovalent vertex since @xmath76 is minimally circle - covered , and would not be minimally dependent by lemma [ l5 ] . since no edge - induced subhypergraph is minimally dependent and the nullity of @xmath76 is @xmath6 , then @xmath76 must be minimally dependent .    in order to complete the proof",
    "we must show that @xmath264 has nullity @xmath6 .",
    "since we know the row rank is @xmath269 we must show @xmath270 solving for @xmath267 this is equivalent to showing @xmath271    by the definition of the cyclomatic number we have @xmath272however , since the degree of every vertex of @xmath76 is equal to @xmath3 we have @xmath273 .",
    "replacing this into the cyclomatic number we get@xmath274          a pseudo - flower is a result from abstracting to hypergraphs .",
    "since balanced flowers are minimally dependent , we examine the balanced flower - parts for a similar simplification locally within each pseudo - flower .",

    "each @xmath6-edge is a pseudo - flower whose flower - part is the @xmath40-edge resulting from weak deletion of the vertex .",
    "it is natural to ask if an oriented hypergraph consisting of a single @xmath41-edge ( or @xmath41-artery via subdivision ) with a @xmath6-edge at each vertex is minimally dependent .",

    "there are @xmath281 essential circles so there are @xmath282 rows that can be zeroed out since the flower - part is balanced , and must contain only vertices of degree equal to @xmath3 .          to see that @xmath1 is minimally dependent observe that the weak deletion of any non - empty subset of edges would either disconnect @xmath1 or result in a monovalent vertex , and is not minimally dependent . since no edge - induced subhypergraph is of @xmath1 is minimally dependent , @xmath1 must be minimally dependent .",
    "the thorns of each pseudo - flower in lemma [ l65 ] can be switched so that every thorn is compatibly oriented with respect to edge @xmath14 .",
    "vertex - contracting these thorns produces a collection of @xmath41 adjacent pseudo - flowers sharing a single common isthmus .",
    "moreover , this is obtained by operations that do not alter minimal dependencies , giving us the following corollary :      a cautionary note concerning corollary [ l66 ] : vertex - contracting a thorn - connection into a hypercircle may not be possible in the larger ambient oriented hypergraph , so any comparisons between thorn - connections and hypercircles must be done on the edge - induced subhypergraph in order to examine the structure of minimal dependencies .",
    "in other words , we must restrict to a specific set of columns when searching for dependency .",
    "it is important to point out that the subdivision of an isthmus in a balanced hypercircle does not need to be compatible to preserve the minimal dependency of that hypercircle since any newly created vertex will not belong to any circle in the subdivision .",
    "it could , however , alter another minimal dependency in a larger ambient oriented hypergraph in which the subdivided edge belongs to a circle .",
    "if the balanced subdivision is incompatible then the newly created vertex in the subdivision does not belong to any circle of @xmath65 . since the new vertex does not belong to any circle of @xmath65 it does not increase the cyclomatic number or the nullity , but does increase the number of vertices and edges each by @xmath6 , so @xmath65 must be dependent .    to see that @xmath65 is minimally dependent",
    "observe that both @xmath289 and @xmath290 contains a monovalent vertex , and by lemma [ l5 ] , neither can be minimally dependent .",
    "moreover , weak deletion of any other edge is equivalent to weak deletion is @xmath1 , which is already minimally dependent .",
    "so no proper edge - induced subhypergraph of @xmath65 is minimally dependent , but @xmath65 is dependent , so @xmath65 is minimally dependent .",
    "let @xmath173 be a balanced hypercircle with maximal pseudo - flowers @xmath191 , @xmath192 , . .",

    ", @xmath293 .",
    "since their flower - parts are pairwise disjoint and @xmath173 is balanced , every vertex belonging to some flower - part must have degree equal to @xmath3 .  also note that every thorn of a pseudo - flower belongs to the flower - part of another  adjacent pseudo - flower ,",
    "so all the vertices of @xmath173 must have degree equal @xmath3 , thus giving @xmath294 .",
    "observe that any collection of essential circles of @xmath173 is the union of a collection of essential circles for each flower - part since the flower - parts are pairwise disjoint , and there are no circles outside of the flower - parts .",
    "thus we have that@xmath295        thus the row rank is one less than the number of columns , and the incidence matrix has nullity equal to @xmath6 .",
    "the weak deletion of any non - empty set of edges leaves a monovalent vertex , which is not minimally dependent by lemma [ l5 ] .",
    "so no edge - induced subhypergraph of @xmath173 is minimally dependent , and @xmath173 is dependent , so @xmath173 is minimally dependent .",
    "since flowers are @xmath6-hypercircles , and @xmath40-edges are @xmath40-hypercircles , we can regard every balanced minimal dependency discussed so far as subdivisions of balanced hypercircles .",
    "these , in fact , are the only balanced minimal dependencies .        to see the converse let @xmath1 be a balanced minimal dependency , and observe that @xmath1 is a connected oriented hypergraph that can not contain any vertices of degree equal to @xmath40 or @xmath6 , by lemma [ l5 ] .",
    "since the degree of any vertex in a minimal dependency is at least @xmath3 , @xmath1 must be a @xmath40-edge , a floral thorn - connection of @xmath6-edge pseudo - flowers , or it must contain a circle . clearly , a @xmath40-edge is minimally dependent , and is a @xmath40-hypercircle by definition , while a floral thorn - connections of @xmath6-edge pseudo - flowers are minimal dependencies by corollary [ l69 ] , so we must show that if @xmath1 contains a circle , then it is a balanced subdivision of a hypercircle .",
    "suppose @xmath1 is a balanced minimal dependency that contains a circle .",
    "since @xmath1 contains a circle it must contain some circle belonging to a flower or flower - part of a pseudo - flower .  if @xmath1 is a flower , then it is minimally dependent by theorem [ l64 ] .",

    "since @xmath1 is balanced , every vertex in the flower - part of @xmath303 must have degree equal to @xmath3 in @xmath303 , by lemma [ l63 ] .",
    "thus , the degree of each vertex of @xmath1 is at least @xmath3 , and thorns of @xmath303 must connect to the rest of @xmath1 via some edge in @xmath304 .",
    "since there are no monovalent vertices in @xmath1 , the paths leading from the thorns of @xmath303 into @xmath304 must reach a circle or terminate at a @xmath6-edge .  if there are no other circles , then @xmath1 consists of a single pseudo - flower @xmath303 and disjoint paths leaving each thorn that meet @xmath6-edge pseudo - flowers .",
    "observe that the paths leaving the thorns of @xmath303 must begin with an anchor of an artery or else it violates minimality of the dependency .",

    "observe that @xmath303 and @xmath191 are flower - part - disjoint or there would exist a circle containing elements from each flower - parts , producing a larger pseudo - flower and contradicting maximality of the pseudo - flowers .",
