    "nuclei of li , be and b in cosmic rays ( cr ) are certainly of secondary origin since their abundance in the solar system is negligibly small .",
    "the term secondary ( s ) is introduced to distinguish them from their parents , which are called primary ( p ) and are heavier than the secondaries .",
    "collisions of primaries with atoms of the interstellar medium ( ism ) result in their fragmentation and give rise to the production of li , be , b and other fragments .",
    "the s / p ratio had been widely used to study cr propagation . besides the boron - to - carbon ( b / c )",
    "ratio other ratios such as f / ne , ( sc+ti+v+cr)/fe have been used . in particular , the mean free path ( grammage ) for the escape from the galaxy @xmath0 and its energy dependence were estimated .",
    "the radioactive isotopes such as @xmath1 were also used to estimate the lifetime of cr nuclei in the galaxy @xmath2 . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the analysis of the recent high precision measurements of the b / c ratio and the li rigidity spectrum presented at cern by the ams-02 collaboration ( oliva for ams-02 coll . , 2015 ;",
    "derome for the ams-02 coll . , 2015 ) .",
    "the data were analysed in several earlier papers viz . by cowsik r. et al . , 2014 ,",
    "tomassetti , 2015a etc . in a set of our own recent papers we analysed the ams-02 data on the proton and helium energy spectra , positron and antiproton fractions ( erlykin and wolfendale , 2013 , 2015a , 2015b ) in terms of possible contributions of the local source . in the present paper",
    "we examine the possibility of reconciling the b / c ratio and the li spectrum measured by the ams-02 experiment with our single source model ( ssm ) .",
    "arguments favouring a local single recent cr source for particles below some tens of tv are well known ( eg . erlykin and wolfendale , 1997 , 2005 ) , but the case is not yet fully proven .",
    "recent precise ams-02 measurements of protons ( aguilar et al . , 2015 ) and helium ( haino for the ams-02 coll . , 2015",
    ") spectra , the positron and electron spectra and fractions ( accardo et al . , 2014 ; aguilar et al . , 2014 ) and antiprotons ( kounine for the ams coll . , 2015",
    ") have been explained by us and others in terms of a local , recent single source ( erlykin and wolfendale , 2013 , 2015a , 2015b ; tomassetti , 2015c ) .",
    "the latest ams-02 results concerning the b / c ratio ( oliva for the ams-02 coll . , 2015 ) and",
    "li rigidity spectrum ( derome for the ams coll . , 2015 )",
    "give the opportunity of a further check on the hypothesis .",
    "b / c ratio determination has a long history and has led to a determination of the mean cr lifetime @xmath3 as a function of rigidity @xmath4 ( see the bibliography in gaisser , 1990 ) .",
    "we have consistently adopted the form @xmath5 at @xmath6 with an energy dependence of @xmath7 of the form @xmath8 ( erlykin and wolfendale , 2001 ) . at @xmath9 , say , the mean lifetime against escape from the galaxy is thus @xmath10 , a time interval greatly in excess of the ages of local known cr sources , supposed to be supernova remnants ( snr ) .",
    "the b- nuclei , and other secondaries , are produced by interactions in the ism both within the remnants ( for the usual snr sources ) and in the ism in general .",
    "the secondaries travel through the ism in the same manner as the primaries and , for the usual leaky box model of the galaxy , the lifetime factor appears once in the expression for the intensity of the primaries , but twice for the secondaries .",
    "that is why the b / c ratio falls with rising rigidity .",
    "for the stable isotopes the diffusion model of the cr propagation in the galaxy is equivalent to the leaky box model . in the framework of this model",
    "the stationary cr secondary to primary s / p ratio is desribed as ( gaisser , 1990 ) @xmath11 here @xmath0 is the escape length , or the grammage , propagated by cosmic rays before they escape from the galaxy , @xmath12 is the cross section for the fragmentation of primary p nuclei into secondary s nuclei and @xmath13 is the cross section for the inelastic collisions of s nuclei with ism nuclei . at rigidities above 1",
    "gv @xmath12 and @xmath13 are approximately constant and only @xmath0 is energy dependent . since at fixed rigidity the escape is the same for all particles the energy dependence of @xmath0 can be derived from a comparison of the emergent spectrum of protons with the observed proton spectrum",
    ". the emergent spectrum of protons accelerated by the shocks in supernova explosions has been calculated by erlykin and wolfendale ( 2001 ) . in the energy range of 1 gev - 1 pev",
    "it has a power law energy behaviour with the differential energy index of @xmath14 .",
    "such a value is common for all models involving fermi - acceleration .",
    "experimental measurements of the gamma - ray energy spectra for several identified snr show a rather broad range of the indices @xmath15 from 1.95 to 2.5 ( rieger et al . , 2013 ) .",
    "our adopted value of @xmath16 is right in the middle of this range .",
    "the proton spectrum observed in the ams-02 experiment is fitted by two power laws smoothly connected with each other . in the 30 - 200 gev energy range coincident with the corresponding rigidity",
    "the observed spectrum is steeper than the emergent one and has the power index of @xmath17 ( aguilar et al.,2015 ) .",
    "the difference in the indices is due to escape so that the rigidity dependence of @xmath0 can be fitted as @xmath18 with @xmath19 . here _",
    "r _ is the rigidity and @xmath20 is an escape length at low energy , which we will discuss later .",
    "another approach to the rigidity dependence of @xmath0 can be connected with energetics arguments .",
    "the energy density of cosmic rays produced by snr can be estimated as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the total energy injected by snr into cr , @xmath23 is the volume of the galaxy , @xmath2 is the mean lifetime of cr in the galaxy and _ t _ is the mean period between sn explosions . if @xmath24 erg , @xmath25 are the radius and half - height of the galactic disc equal to 15 kpc and 1 kpc respectively , @xmath26y and @xmath27y , then the energy input rate and the energy density of cr in the galaxy are @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively , which are reasonable values estimated still in the sixties by ginzburg and syrovatsky , ( 1964 ) .",
    "if the emergent spectrum has the power law behaviour @xmath30 then the total cr energy density above @xmath31 is @xmath32 with @xmath33 as the speed of light .",
    "we compare estimated and observed energy density at energies above 45 gev chosen by the ams-02 collaboration as the fitting parameter .",
    "if in our emergent power law spectrum @xmath34 , then above 45 gev cr carry @xmath35 fraction of the total energy .",
    "the power law part of the proton spectrum above 45 gev ( @xmath36 ) observed by ams-02 collaboration contains 0.045 ev@xmath37 . in order to get this energy content",
    "the lifetime of cr above 45 gev should be @xmath38s = @xmath39y .",
    "since the cr lifetime being @xmath40 at 1 gev diminishes to @xmath41 at 45 gev then the lifetime has to fall as @xmath42 with @xmath43 which agrees well with the estimate of @xmath44 made from the difference of the power indices of the observed and emergent proton spectra .",
    "we understand all the uncerainties incorporated into these estimates and consider all numerical estimates described above only as an illustration .",
    "however , we are sure that the lifetime of primaries in the galaxy has to decrease with the energy faster than that with the power index of 0.3 - 0.6 derived usually from the energy dependence of boron - to - carbon ratio and with the index 0.5 , as used by us in the past .      the preliminary data on the b / c ratio presented by ams-02 collaboration ( aguilar et al . , 2015 )",
    "demonstrate the power law behaviour only at rigidities above  20 gv . with decreasing rigidity below  20 gv",
    "the b / c ratio becomes flatter and approaches a constant at 2 - 3 gv .",
    "we think that solar modulation is not responsible for this flattening , because for the fixed rigidity it should reduce boron and carbon fluxes by the same factor .",
    "the b / c ratio is described by the expression ( 1 ) in which symbols s and p should be replaced by b and c , but c should include also all parent nuclei heavier than c. as has been already mentioned the mean free paths @xmath45 and @xmath46 are nearly constant at energies above 1 gev so that only the term @xmath47 can distort the power law behaviour of b / c at low energies , where @xmath0 is comparable with @xmath46 . in order to make numerical estimate we used cross sections @xmath48 and @xmath49 from silberberg and tsao , ( 1973 ) updated recently by tomassetti , ( 2015b ) . in the calculations the production of both @xmath50 and @xmath51 isotopes was taken into account and the cross sections of the particular reactions were weighted with the abundance of the parent nuclei taken from sihver et al.(1993 ) . the calculated fragmentation length @xmath45 and the inelastic interaction length @xmath46 were obtained as @xmath52 and @xmath53 . at a rigidity of 2 gv the b / c ratio is 0.31 ( oliva for the ams-02 call . , 2015 ) and using this ratio with the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 in the expression ( 1 ) we obtain @xmath54 . taking this value as the @xmath20 parameter",
    "we conclude that @xmath55 the grammage is the product of the mean gas density @xmath56 and the pathlength @xmath57 propagated during their lifetime by cr primaries in the region where they produced boron : @xmath58 with @xmath59 as the velocity of the particle . since measurements of radioactive isotopes give an estimate @xmath60 in the gv region ( connell et al . ,",
    "1997 ) then @xmath61 i.e. by an order of magnitude higher than the usually taken value of @xmath62 . to us",
    "it gives evidence that boron is produced mainly in the dense envelopes of snr .",
    "the b / c ratio expected from the expression ( 1 ) is shown in figure 1 by the full line denoted as bgrd ( background ) .",
    "it is seen that in the region above several gv the experimental ratios are in excess of expectation .",
    "we attribute this excess to the contribution of the local snr which we call the single source. the expected b / c ratio described by the expression ( 1 ) is supposed to be due to the background from the old and distant snr .",
    "in fact , the difference between the two b / c ratios is not equivalent to the b / c ratio of one of these components .",
    "however , an examination of the flattenings in the carbon and oxygen energy spectra ( see adriani et al . , 2014 ) which presumably are due to contributions of the single source shows that this contribution is small .",
    "therefore , the difference between the observed and expected b / c ratios can be referred to the @xmath63 ratio and its shape reflects the energy behaviour of the boron energy spectrum .",
    "since it is expected that the single source is a local snr then its energy spectrum is hard and its contribution to the ratio at gev energies is negligibly small .",
    "the observed ratio in the gev region is completely determined by the background and our determination of @xmath0 from the expression ( 1 ) is based on this assumption .      at ms-02 days at cern '",
    "the preliminary data on the rigidity spectrum of lithium was presented by derome and ting , 2015 ) .",
    "it is shown in figure 2 in double - logatithmic scale .",
    "experimental points ( open circles ) are from ting ( 2015 ) .",
    "it is seen that the spectrum has an evident irregularity - it flattens above  300gv like spectra of protons and other nuclei .",
    "the dashed line is the background expected from the assumption that li parent nuclei ( c , n , o etc . )",
    "being primaries have the same rigidity spectrum as protons above 30gv , i.e. @xmath64 and the escape length line is determined by the expression ( 2 ) .",
    "the stars are the difference between the experimental data and the background .",
    "the origin of the dotted line will be discussed later .",
    "boron and lithium are secondary nuclei .",
    "it is interesting to compare them with the other secondary cr components - positrons and antiprotons taking 200 gv as the datum rigidity we compare the enhancement factors @xmath65 = ss intensity/ bgrd intensity .",
    "we have derived @xmath65 for each component with the result : @xmath66 .",
    "errors are not quoted because unknown systematic errors are significant .",
    "for instance , if the starting rigidity for the steeper li background spectrum is reduced from 30gv to 15 gv ( dotted line in figure 2 ) then the enhancement factor @xmath67 increases from 1.3 to 2.7 . taking into account that the higher enhancement factor @xmath68 for positrons can be due to the contribution of a pulsar associated with snr",
    "it can be said that all the other enhacements are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "this fact can be regarded as a hint that the excess of all secondaries is produced by the same single source , presumably a snr .",
    "the large value of @xmath0 indicates that the region where they are produced has relatively high density , most likely within the snr envelope or in the nearby molecular cloud .",
    "the consequence of this indication is that the snr should be the gamma source since gamma quanta are also secondaries and should be copiously produced on the thick target .",
    "the question is whether the assumed snr is an average one or it has special properties different from the average . here",
    ", attention can be drawn to the possible scenario in which it is pointed out that some young type ii sn produce high quantity of @xmath51 .",
    "the value of @xmath69 , for example , increases by between 10 and 100 for shocks of velocity 6000kms@xmath70 compared with 4000kms@xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , for the same shock velocity the @xmath69 ratio increases by a factor of 300 in going from effective radius of @xmath71 to @xmath72 ( dearborn et al.,1989 ) .",
    "clearly , there is considerable sensitivity and our estimate of @xmath73 could be subject to change .    turning to @xmath68",
    "presumably most positrons are produced in @xmath74 decays and their numbers will depend on the location of interactions , the gas density there and the trapping by the ambient ( compressed ? ) magnetic field .",
    "again , there is sensitivity to the conditions in the snr .",
    "finally , with respect to @xmath75 , the situation is similar to that for @xmath68 .",
    "the number of @xmath76 will depend on the location of their parent s interactios as their subsequent acceleration .",
    "as it has been already mentioned the analysis of positron / electron and antiproton / proton ratios gives support to the significant contribution of the the local single source to these ratios ( erlykin and wolfendale , 2013 , 2015b ) .    at present",
    "it seems more likely that the local single source is a roughly typical snr .",
    "we can not point to a paticular nearby snr , but our guess is that vela is too young and not seen with protons at gev and tev energies .",
    "its contribution is seen in the sharp knee in the pev region .",
    "the most likely candidates which produce an excess of secondary particles are geminga and monogem ring snr .",
    "since the monogem ring is seen only in x rays then geminga is preferrable as the single source since it is also an intensive gamma - ray source .",
    "a technique that is hoped to adopt in the future in order to elucidate the properties of the sn is to examine the sn models from the standpoint of determining the relative masses of nuclei in the stellar wind of the pre - cursor star .",
    "comparison of the measured cr fluxes with those from the stellar wind should yield the mass of the progenitor star .",
    "a first order attempt has been made using the analysis of arnett et al.(1989 ) , which , related to sn 1987a , yields a mass of @xmath77 but further , more sophisticated analysis is needed .",
    "a further on - going analysis relates to possible fine structure in the spectral data .",
    "we draw attention to possible small excesses over smooth spectra in the region of 200 gv for @xmath78 b / c and li .",
    "furthermore , there is a deficit in the iron spectrum at the same rigidity in the iron intensity that shows up in the o / fe and c / fe ( primaries , not secondaries , see tomassetti , 2015c ) .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the natural variation in ism variations from place to place , as well as the dependence of the iron yield in the pre - cursor stellar mass .",
    "the data on the b / c ratio and the li rigidity spectrum presented by the ams-02 collaboration at days of ams-02 at cern meeting ( oliva for the ams-02 coll . , 2015 ; derome for the ams-02 coll . , 2015 , ting for the ams-02 coll . , 2015 )",
    "are preliminary , therefore results of our analysis given in this paper are also preliminary .",
    "however , we think that most of these results will survive with time since the precision of the ams-02 experimental data is extremely high even at the preliminary stage .",
    "we think that the most convincing argument for the contribution of the single source to the b / c ratio and the li rigidity spectrum is the difference between the relatively flat rigidity dependence of these secondaries ( @xmath79 ) and the steep slope of the expected background spectra ( @xmath80 ) expected from the comparison of the proton spectrum , measured by the ams-02 collaboration ( @xmath81 ) and our snr emergent spectrum ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "all other arguments can be regarded as hints , although the approximate coincidence of enhancement factors for antiprotons , b / c ratio and lithium rigidity spectrum is encouraging .",
    "we appreciate that there are questions on the described scenario .",
    "observations of gamma rays from some snr indicate the emergent spectra of cr with the exponential index of @xmath82 , which can be steeper than that adopted by us here as @xmath16 on the basis of the theory of fermi - type acceleration in snr . however , the number of such observations is still poor to disprove the snr origin of most cr .",
    "another interesting question relates to the expected rapid rise of the cr anisotropy with the rising energy for the derived value of @xmath83 in the sub - tev and tev energy region .",
    "such a rise is not observed so far in all the experiments and this controversy needs an explanation .",
    "perhaps , the rise of the anisotropy expected for @xmath83 is related to the fixed mass of the primary cosmic rays : protons , helium etc . and the rise of anisotropy for protons is compensated by the rising fraction of heavier nuclei with their higher isotropy in the observed total primary flux or with the opposite phase ( erlykin and wolfendale , 2015c ) .",
    "the interesting consequence of our scenario is the large value of the escape pathlength ( @xmath0 ) derived from the b / c ratio at low rigidities .",
    "it indicates that the observed excess of secondaries is produced in the region of high gas density .",
    "the consequence of this feature is that our single source should be searched for among gamma - ray sources .",
    "finally , we conclude that the new data on the b / c ratio and the lithium rigidity spectrum give support to our single source model .",
