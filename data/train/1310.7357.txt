    "electrical conductivity in composite materials can be achieved by embedding a network of conducting filler particles in an insulating polymeric matrix .",
    "it is well known that the conductivity of such dispersions can be greatly enhanced by using filler particles with a large degree of shape anisotropy , due to the increased excluded volume effects associated with highly non - spherical particles @xcite . this enhancement in turn makes it possible to reduce significantly the loading of conductor necessary to establish an adequate level of electrical connectedness for a given purpose @xcite .",
    "a low filler concentration is often desirable in order to preserve the optical and mechanical properties of the host insulating medium .",
    "therefore , the rationale behind a large amount of experimental work done in the last decade , with particular emphasis on carbon nanotube ( cnt ) fillers dispersed in polymeric matrices , has been to attain high conductivities with low filler concentration ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite for comprehensive reviews ) . with this goal in mind ,",
    "elongated fillers with diameters on the micron scale , such as stainless steel fibers or metallized glass fibers were already being employed in the early 1980s @xcite . in nanocomposites , in addition to cnts , insulating polymers have also been loaded with short conducting carbon fibers @xcite and metal nanowires @xcite .",
    "recently it has been reported that the conductivity of a cnt - based nanocomposite can be greatly enhanced at a given concentration of cnts by adding small quantities of conductive latex depletants , which lead to attractive depletion interactions between the cnts @xcite .",
    "weak attractive interactions induced by surfactant micelles have also been shown to strongly enhance the dielectric constant in dispersions of cnts in aqueous solution @xcite .",
    "on the theoretical side , by modeling fibrous fillers as rigid cylinders , capped cylinders or spheroids , conductivity has usually been interpreted in terms of percolation theory using both analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite methods . in the percolation approach ,",
    "the filler particles are considered as being coated with a penetrable contact shell , and connectivity between two particles is established at the point where their shells overlap . the system becomes electrically conducting at the percolation threshold @xmath0 , which is the critical volume fraction of filler particles above which a system - spanning cluster of interconnected fillers is always found .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath0 are thus used to estimate the conductor ",
    "insulator transition of real composites .",
    "the theoretical studies mentioned above deal with dispersions of penetrable or impenetrable pure rod - like fluids without taking into account further sources of interaction . in the framework of percolation theory , the effects of depletion interactions have been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where particle interactions are mediated by a square well attractive potential and in refs .",
    "@xcite , where hard spherical depletant particles are added explicitly into the insulating phase .",
    "this work has revealed an interplay of opposing effects . on the one hand",
    ", depletion encourages attraction between the surfaces of the rods , which leads to a higher density of overlapping shells and a lower percolation density . on the other hand",
    ", depletion also enhances mutual alignment of neighboring rods , decreasing the spatial extent of the clusters and tending to raise the percolation threshold .",
    "however , the former effect has been shown to be the stronger @xcite and the net result of depletion is to lower the density required for percolation .",
    "theoretical studies on the conductivity of networks of attractive rods have so far concentrated on determining the location of the percolation threshold for a particular choice of contact shell thickness . for a real composite ,",
    "however , the details of charge transport across the network at filler concentrations above the conductor - insulator transition are crucial . motivated by the recent reinterpretation of tunneling transport for composites loaded with anisotropic particles in terms of a global tunneling network @xcite , we present here a numerical analysis of the conductivity of mixtures composed of conducting spherocylinders and insulating spheres .",
    "we show that the addition of a low concentration of spherical depletants enhances the tunneling conductivity of the sub - system of conducting rods with respect to the case without depletants .",
    "the magnitude of this effect rises as the concentration of rods is increased and continues to enhance the conductivity in the regime where the conducting network is well established , eventually falling off slightly at the highest concentrations included in this work . by computing the critical distance @xmath1 associated with the critical path approximation for system conductivity , we observe that the average of the relevant interparticle distance is lowered by depletion , thereby favoring electronic transport .",
    "we also show that the numerical conductivity results can be reproduced by applying an effective medium approximation , previously formulated for the case of spherical fillers , here generalized to the case of fluids of conducting spherocylinders .",
    "we find that the behavior of the effective conductance and the effects of the depletant particles can be fully understood in terms of an appropriate pair distribution function dependent on the distance between the cores of two spherocylinders",

    "we model mixtures of conducting rod - like fillers and insulating spherical depletants by a binary system composed of @xmath7 impenetrable spherocylinders of length @xmath8 and diameter @xmath9 , and @xmath10 hard spheres .",
    "since in experiments the depletant particles have diameters comparable to those of cnts @xcite , we set the sphere diameter equal to @xmath9 .",
    "we also require that the two species of particles are mutually impenetrable . by representing the spherical depletants explicitly , rather than implicitly through an effective potential ,",
    "we ensure that all many - body effects are , by construction , included .",
    "the volume fractions for spherocylinders and spheres dispersed in a cubic box of edge @xmath11 are , respectively , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . here ,",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are the volumes of one spherocylinder and one sphere , respectively , while @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the corresponding number densities .",
    "we simulate systems of @xmath18 sphereocylinders with @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 spherocylinders with @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) . depending on @xmath24 , the number of spheres ranges between @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    to generate equilibrium dispersions of the mixture , we start by introducing the rods and the spheres into the periodic simulation cell by random sequential addition , i.e. , simply assigning a uniformly distributed random position and orientation to each particle in turn and accepting any insertion that does not lead to an overlap with particles that have been already placed .",
    "we test the overlap between two spherocylinders @xmath3 and @xmath2 by computing the shortest distance @xmath27 between the two line segments coinciding with the axes of the spherocylinders @xcite . if @xmath27 is less than @xmath9 , the two spherocylinders overlap .",
    "the shortest distance is computed by minimizing @xmath28 with respect to @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the range @xmath31 to @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the displacement vector between the two rod centers , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are unit vectors along the axes of rods @xmath3 and @xmath2 , respectively ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we then perform a standard metropolis monte carlo equilibration consisting of trial translational and rotational moves for each rod and sphere .",
    "given the simple hard core potential , trial moves that do not lead to hard - core overlap of the particles are always accepted , while moves that do generate overlaps are rejected .",
    "we monitor any global alignment of the rods by means of the nematic order parameter @xmath34 which is the largest eigenvalue of the tensor @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the identity matrix @xcite . for the range of concentrations of rods and spheres used in this study",
    ", @xmath34 is always close to zero , which indicates that the dispersions of spherocylinders are isotropic .",
    "in modeling the electron transfer between spherocylinders , we neglect charging and coulomb interaction effects and assume that the conductance @xmath37 between any two spherocylinders @xmath3 and @xmath2 is given by single - electron tunneling processes : @xmath38 here , @xmath6 is a shorthand notation for @xmath39 which is the minimal distance between the surfaces of rods @xmath3 and @xmath2 , given their relative position and orientation vectors , as schematically illustrated in fig .",

    "equation   captures the dominant dependence of the conductance between two rods on their relative positions and orientations , i.e. , the exponential decay as a function of the single distance of closest approach @xmath6 of the rods .",
    "however , this simple formula neglects any explicit dependence of the conductivity on the mutual alignment of the rods . the relative orientation does not affect the exponential dependence on @xmath6 , but strong alignment can enhance the pre - exponential factor",
    "this enhancement becomes significant only when the centers of the two rods are close and the angle between the two rods is small .",

    "we solve the kirchhoff equations of the reduced network by combining exact numerical decimation with a preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm @xcite .",

    "the interest in evaluating @xmath1 stems from the observation of ref .",
    "@xcite that when the values of the single conductances @xmath64 vary over many orders of magnitude , and so when the @xmath6 distances span several multiples of the tunneling decay length @xmath40 , the network conductance is dominated by the characteristic bond conductance @xmath65 .",

    "however , unlike the usual percolation approach of imposing a fixed contact shell thickness , the cpa uses a variable thickness whose value responds to the structure of the fluid .",

    "the mechanism of transport enhancement is the depletion effect of the spheres , which induces an effective attraction between the conducting rods .",
    "previous work @xcite has already established that the percolation threshold with an arbitrarily chosen contact shell thickness is lowered by depletion attraction .",
    "however , we have taken the analysis further in the present work in two ways .",
    "first , within the framework of percolation theory , the critical path approximation not only shows and quantifies how the minimum distance required for a sub - system of rods to span the system decreases with increasing depletant concentration , but also provides a good approximation to the conductivity over a wide range of parameters , thus clarifying the role of depletants through the reduction of the dominant tunneling distances .",
    "second , moving on from approaches based on percolation theory , we were also able to reproduce the simulation - based conductivity results by applying a simple effective medium approximation to the tunneling network formed by the rods . using the pair distribution function for the distance of closest approach of the spherocylinders , computed from our simulations , we found that the resulting effective conductance has the same functional dependence on the system parameters as was observed from the full calculation of the conductivity .    to conclude ,",
    "let us comment on a possible extension of our work . as pointed out in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , the model of electron transfer of eq .   neglects possible effects of mutual rod alignment on the probability of tunneling between rods .",
    "although this approximation is valid for isotropic dispersions of rods , such as the ones considered in the present work , for systems with a high degree of rod alignment the dependence of tunneling on the relative rod orientation should be taken into consideration @xcite .",
    "in particular , the tunneling conductance is expected to be larger when the rods are aligned , and so it may compete with the reduction of connectivity when the concentration of depletants is sufficiently large to induce nematic order . further studies in this direction are computationally demanding , but would shed light on still unexplored issues .",
