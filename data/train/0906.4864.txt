    "given a closed , irreducible 3manifold , its complexity is the minimum number of tetrahedra in a ( pseudo  simplicial ) triangulation of the manifold .",
    "this number agrees with the complexity defined by matveev  @xcite unless the manifold is @xmath1 @xmath2 or @xmath3 it follows from the definition that the complexity is known for all closed , irreducible manifolds which appear in certain computer generated censuses . in general , the question of determining the complexity of a given closed 3-manifold is difficult and one is therefore interested in finding both upper and lower bounds . whilst an upper bound arises from the presentation of a manifold via a spine , a heegaard splitting or a triangulation , matveev  @xcite states that the problem of finding lower bounds is quite difficult .",
    "lower bounds using homology groups or the fundamental group are given by matveev and pervova  @xcite , and lower bounds using hyperbolic volume are given by matveev , petronio and vesnin  @xcite .",
    "these bounds are only known to be sharp for a few census examples .",
    "in @xcite the authors found a lower bound for the complexity using covering spaces and used it to classify all manifolds realising this lower bound .",
    "in particular , this determined two infinite families of minimal triangulations , and hence the complexity for infinitely many manifolds .",
    "this lower bound supposes the existence of a non - trivial @xmath0cohomology class ( or , equivalently , the existence of a connected double cover of the manifold ) . the present paper uses the existence of multiple @xmath0cohomology classes to give a new lower bound for complexity using an analogue of thurston s norm , and the minimal triangulations realising this bound",

    "moreover , it is shown that an infinite family of triangulations realises this bound . whilst this family already arose in @xcite ,",
    "the methods are more generally applicable and lead to a structure theory for the minimal triangulations which are close to realising the lower bound .",
    "the new lower bound also gives very tight two sided bounds for many new examples .",
    "moreover , the bootstrapping method of @xcite using covers can be combined with this approach  using higher covering degree and the existence of covers with arbitrarily large @xmath0cohomology .    the effectiveness of the new bounds arising in this work result from the desire not only to know the complexity of a manifold but also some or all minimal triangulations realising this complexity .",

    "using these ideas , one can effectively try to understand vertical sections of the census which pick up a finite cover of every manifold .",
    "especially with view towards infinite families of minimal triangulations of hyperbolic manifolds , this seems to be the most promising approach to date as the largest known census at the time of writing goes up to complexity 12 , but hyperbolic examples only appear from complexity 9 and are sparse amongst these low complexity manifolds .",

    "since an outermost annulus in the latter family is boundary compressible , there is an isotopy of @xmath6 reducing the number of curves in @xmath389 this contradicts the assumption that @xmath6 meets @xmath381 minimally .",
    "hence assume that @xmath386 is one - sided .",
    "it follows that @xmath6 is either @xmath390 @xmath391 or @xmath392 if @xmath388 is @xmath374 or @xmath375 then @xmath387 has a single boundary component and hence is a uniquely determined incompressible one - sided surface , @xmath393 if @xmath394 then @xmath387 is a boundary parallel annulus , and there is an isotopy making @xmath383 which contradicts the assumption that @xmath6 meets @xmath381 minimally .",
    "it follows that , up to isotopy , a connected , one - sided , incompressible surfaces in @xmath337 is one of @xmath372 @xmath395 and @xmath396 since @xmath21 has rank two , each of these three surfaces must be incompressible .",
    "it follows from the construction that @xmath397 we claim that , up to re - labeling , @xmath398 and @xmath399 notice that the boundary curve of @xmath400 is a regular fibre , and hence a @xmath401curve on @xmath380 with respect to the standard longitude and meridian .",
