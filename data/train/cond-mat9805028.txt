    "one of the fundamental achievements of the renormalization - group ( rg ) theory of critical phenomena is the identification of universality classes in terms of the dimensionality @xmath19 of the system and the number @xmath10 of components of the order parameter @xcite .",
    "specifically , rg theory predicts that the critical exponents , certain amplitude ratios and scaling functions are universal quantities that do not depend , e.g. , on the strength of the interaction or on thermodynamic variables ( such as the pressure ) .",
    "the superfluid transition of @xmath18he belongs to the @xmath11 , @xmath14 universality class and provides a unique opportunity for an experimental test of the universality prediction by means of measurements of the critical behavior at various pressures @xmath20 along the @xmath21-line @xmath22 .",
    "early tests have been performed by ahlers and collaborators and consistency with the universality prediction was found within the experimental resolution @xcite . at a significantly higher level of accuracy ,",
    "the superfluid density and the specific heat ( or , equivalently , thermal expansion coefficient ) above and below @xmath22 are planned to be measured in the superfluid universality experiment ( sue ) @xcite under microgravity conditions or at reduced gravity in the low - gravity simulator @xcite .",
    "as demonstrated recently @xcite , this would allow to perform measurements up to @xmath23 in the reduced temperature @xmath24 .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the corresponding challenge is to calculate as accurately as possible the properties of the o(@xmath10 ) symmetric @xmath3 model in three dimensions . to extract the leading critical exponents from the experimental data and to demonstrate their universality at a highly quantitative level requires detailed knowledge on the ingredients of a nonlinear rg analysis @xcite .",
    "they include not only the well - known rg exponent functions of the @xmath3 model whose fixed point values determine the critical exponents but also the less well - known amplitude functions @xcite which contain the information about universal ratios of leading and subleading amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the existing theoretical predictions on the critical exponents @xcite within the minimal subtraction scheme @xcite are based on field - theoretic calculations to five - loop order @xcite and borel resummation . by contrast , the present theoretical knowledge of the amplitude ratios for @xmath25 below @xmath6 is based only on low - order ( mainly 1- and 2-loop ) calculations which imply an uncertainty at the level of at least 1030% @xcite .",
    "it has therefore been proposed @xcite to significantly reduce this uncertainty by performing new higher - order field - theoretic calculations and borel resummations of various amplitude functions in three dimensions .",
    "both conceptual and computational steps towards this goal have already been performed .",
    "the conceptual progress includes the demonstration that the @xmath26 field theory suggested by parisi @xcite can well be realized within the minimal subtraction scheme at @xmath11 @xcite by incorporating symanzik s non - vanishing mass shift @xcite and that spurious goldstone singularities for @xmath25 below @xmath6 can well be treated within this approach @xcite by using an appropriately defined pseudo - correlation length @xcite .",
    "the computational steps include the determination of the amplitude functions @xmath4 and @xmath7 of the specific heat in three dimensions above @xmath6 for @xmath27 @xcite and below @xmath6 for @xmath8 @xcite , respectively , up to five - loop order , and their borel resummation . these calculations , however , were not yet complete because of an approximation regarding the additive renormalization @xmath28 of the specific heat and the associated rg function @xmath1 .",
    "due to the lack of knowledge in the literature about higher - order terms , @xmath28 and @xmath1 were approximated by their two - loop expressions .",
    "although the good agreement between low - order @xmath11 perturbation results @xcite and accurate experiments @xcite provided some indication for the smallness of the effect of the higher - order terms of @xmath1 , no reliable estimate could be given for the remaining uncertainty of @xmath29 which could well be of relevance at the level of accuracy anticipated in future experiments @xcite .",
    "furthermore we recall that any inaccuracy of @xmath1 enters not only the formulas @xcite for several universal amplitude ratios but also the formulas needed to determine the effective coupling @xmath30 from the specific heat @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to provide the missing information on the higher - order terms of @xmath28 and @xmath1 by means of a new five - loop calculation .",
    "we shall show that the analytic calculation of @xmath28 and @xmath1 can be directly related to the previous calculations @xcite of the four - point vertex function .",
    "this provides the crucial simplification that no new evaluations of three- , four- and five - loop integrals are necessary but that only a new determination of symmetry and o(@xmath10 ) group factors of vacuum diagrams is sufficient .    using the five - loop expression of @xmath1 we are in the position to determine the correct higher - order terms of the minimally renormalized amplitude functions @xmath4 for @xmath5 and @xmath7 for @xmath8 in three dimensions on the basis of previous work @xcite where a different renormalization scheme was used .",
    "the new coefficients of the higher - order terms of @xmath4 turn out to differ considerably from the previous approximate coefficients @xcite whereas the coefficients of @xmath7 are only weakly affected by the new higher - order terms of @xmath1 .",
    "we also perform new borel resummations of @xmath1 for @xmath31 as well as of @xmath7 and of @xmath32 for @xmath8 .",
    "it turns out that the result of the borel resummation for @xmath1 including the new terms up to five - loop order differs from the two - loop result @xmath33 by only less than 1% at the fixed point . for the amplitude functions ,",
    "our new borel resummation results differ from the previous ones @xcite by about 1% for @xmath34 and by less than 0.1% for @xmath35 at the fixed point .",
    "this is a nontrivial and important confirmation of the previous conjectures about the smallness of resummed higher - order contributions @xcite .    as a first application",
    ", we calculate the universal ratios @xmath12 and @xmath36 of the leading and subleading amplitudes of the specific heat above and below @xmath6 for @xmath8 and @xmath11 .",
    "in addition we calculate borel resummation values of @xmath12 for @xmath14 and 3 by combining our present results for @xmath1 and @xmath4 for @xmath14 and 3 with those of a recent three - loop calculation of @xmath7 for general @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "all of our calculations are performed at @xmath11 dimensions , without using the @xmath15 expansion .",
    "our result @xmath13 for @xmath14 is more accurate than the previous result @xcite @xmath37 obtained from the @xmath9 expansion up to @xmath16 and agrees well with the high - precision experimental result @xcite @xmath38 for @xmath18he near the superfluid transition obtained from a recent experiment in space .",

    "we would like to stress that this calculation does not require new five - loop integrations but can be performed on the basis of the previous five - loop calculation @xcite of the four - point vertex function combined with an appropriate identification of symmetry and o(@xmath10 ) group factors of vacuum diagrams which are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : vacuum ] .",
    "their negative sum determines the helmholtz free energy @xmath77 up to five - loop order . for the present purpose of determining the pole terms at @xmath70 it suffices to consider only the case @xmath78 and @xmath79 where only four - point vertices exist .",

    "thus the structure of the diagrammatic expression of a typical diagram , e.g. , @xmath94 is @xmath95 with @xmath96 and the propagators @xmath97 .",
    "the symmetry and group factors are listed in table [ table : symmetry ] .    to calculate the additive renormalization constant @xmath73 one needs to calculate those ultraviolet @xmath70 pole terms of the diagrams contributing to @xmath98 that are left after subtraction of subdivergences .",

    "<S> our result for @xmath13 for @xmath14 is significantly more accurate than the previous result obtained from the @xmath15 expansion up to @xmath16 and agrees well with the high - precision experimental result @xmath17 for @xmath18he near the superfluid transition obtained from a recent experiment in space .    </S>"
