    "multiple access is necessary in any communications system where coordinated resource allocation is not possible or too costly .",
    "classical uncoordinated techniques include the aloha systems introduced in the 1970s @xcite and carrier sense based techniques @xcite , such as carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance . to provide reliable communication",
    ", these techniques typically require a retransmission policy , which introduces the need for a separate feedback channel and incurs in a possibly large delay .",
    "recently , a considerable interest for finding novel solutions to provide reliable , low latency communication in dynamical systems has emerged , driven by the stringent requirements of the upcoming 5 g communication systems @xcite .",
    "one promising uncoordinated multiple access technique is coded slotted aloha ( csa ) @xcite .",
    "csa builds on the classical slotted aloha technique and borrows ideas from error correcting codes to provide highly reliable uncoordinated multiple access .    in csa",
    ", transmission is organized into frames , each consisting of the same number of slots .",
    "two key ingredients of csa is to let users replicate each packet a number of times within a frame and to perform iterative decoding using successive interference cancellation ( sic ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in standard csa , referred to as in the sequel , all users are assumed to be frame - synchronized .",
    "a major contribution made in @xcite was realizing that there exists a connection between csa and codes on graphs .",
    "indeed , a csa system can be described by a bipartite graph and sic can be performed over the graph similarly to decoding of graph - based codes .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that the performance of csa resembles that of graph - based codes , i.e. , the packet loss rate ( plr ) curve is characterized by a waterfall ( wf ) region for medium - to - high system loads and it shows an error floor ( ef ) for low system loads .",
    "furthermore , in the asymptotic regime of infinite frame length , csa exhibits a threshold behavior , which can be characterized using density evolution ( de ) .",
    "the de for fs - csa was derived in @xcite .    to improve the delay performance of fs - csa , a system was proposed in @xcite . in contrast to fs - csa",
    ", users in fa - csa are not frame - synchronized . instead , a user that joins the system selects slots for its packet replicas from a number of subsequent slots , which form its local frame .",
    "the duration of the local frame ( in number of slots ) is the same for each user . using simulations , it was shown in @xcite that , in addition to improve the average delay , outperforms in terms of throughput .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a thorough analysis of the plr performance of in the asymptotic and finite frame length regime .",
    "more specifically , we derive the ( approximate ) de that governs the asymptotic performance of in the limit of very large frame lengths .",
    "interestingly , if the receiver can monitor the system before transmitting , a boundary effect similar to that of spatially - coupled codes @xcite naturally arises .",
    "this greatly improves the iterative decoding threshold as compared to that of .",
    "similar improved thresholds were achieved in @xcite , where the concept of spatial coupling was applied to csa . however , while the spatially coupled structure is enforced by design in @xcite , in it is inherent to the system .",
    "we also derive analytical approximations of the plr in the finite frame length regime in order to predict the ef of .",
    "the analysis is based on the framework introduced in @xcite and @xcite , where the probability of occurrence of minimal stopping sets was used to approximate the plr of .",
    "the ef of and was also analyzed in @xcite . however , the analysis is restricted to regular distributions and considers a single , trivial stopping set .",
    "we show that in the finite frame length regime yields superior performance than that of in both the wf and ef regions .",
    "furthermore , by means of simulations , we confirm and further elaborate on the results regarding the delay performance of fa - csa in @xcite .",
    "we show that yields lower average delay than , albeit at the cost of a higher maximum delay .",
    "we then compare and with a constraint on the maximum delay and receiver memory size , and show that achieves better plr than also in this case .",
    "finally , we compare and in the finite frame length regime .",
    "it is shown that performs better than , both in terms of plr and delay .",
    "we would like to remark that the boundary effect that arises in fa - csa has already been observed for other asynchronous random access techniques in the past .",
    "in particular , in @xcite it was recognized that the excellent performance of the interference cancellation system proposed in @xcite for the cdma2000 1xev - do reverse link was due to spatial coupling . at the time of @xcite , however , the concept of spatial coupling was not known yet .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . the system model and the bipartite - graph representation of csa",
    "are presented in section  [ sec : system_model ] . in section  [ sec : dd ] , the degree distributions of fa - csa are derived .",
    "the de equations of fa - csa are then derived in section  [ sec : de ] using the analysis in section  [ sec : dd ] .",
    "the analysis of the performance of fa - csa in the finite frame length regime is addressed in section  [ sec : ef ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : results ] presents and discusses numerical results and section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "we consider a csa system with multiple users transmitting to a common receiver , where time is divided into slots , each of duration @xmath0 , and where users are slot - synchronized .",
    "a user that joins the system generates a message and selects a repetition factor @xmath1 randomly according to a predefined degree distribution @xcite .",
    "the message is then mapped into a physical layer packet of duration @xmath0 ( including guard intervals ) , such that one packet can be sent within one slot .",
    "the user transmits @xmath1 copies ( called replicas ) of the packet in randomly selected slots .",
    "a user that repeats its packet @xmath1 times is called a degree-@xmath1 user and similarly a slot containing @xmath2 replicas from different users is called a degree-@xmath2 slot .",
    "it is assumed that a packet can always be decoded if at least one of its replicas is in a degree-@xmath3 slot .",
    "furthermore , to facilitate decoding , each replica of a packet contains pointers to all other replicas of that packet . throughout the paper",
    "we assume that perfect sic can be performed to remove the interference of a user s replicas once its packet has been decoded .",
    "this assumption makes the analysis of the system more feasible . in @xcite",
    "actual ( low complexity ) sic was implemented with little performance degradation as compared to perfect sic .",
    "we assume that users join the system on a slot - by - slot basis according to a poisson process and let @xmath4 denote the number of users that join in a slot . therefore , @xmath4 is a poisson - distributed random variable ( rv ) with mean @xmath5 , @xmath6 , where @xmath5 is the average system load in users per slot .",
    "the probability that @xmath7 users join the system in a given slot is thus @xmath8 this is a common user model for multiple access techniques , used , e.g. , in the original aloha systems @xcite .",
    "we define the two most important performance measures for csa .",
    "the plr , denoted by @xmath9 , is the average probability that the packet of an arbitrary user is never resolved .",
    "[ def : plr ]    [ def : delay ] the delay of a resolved user s packet is the number of slots between the slot the user joins the system and the slot following the decoding of its packet .      in",
    ", communication takes place during _ global frames _ consisting of @xmath10 slots each . a degree-@xmath1 user that joins the system waits until the next frame and transmits its @xmath1 replicas in randomly chosen slots of that frame",
    "we then say that the user is _ active _ during the whole duration of the frame .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the rv representing the number of active users per frame .",
    "note that the active users in a frame are all the users that joined the system during the previous frame .",
    "we consider decoding of performed on a slot - by - slot basis .",
    "assume the decoding of slot @xmath12 .",
    "first , the interference caused by packets for which replicas in previous slots have already been decoded is canceled from the slot .",
    "the receiver then checks if slot @xmath12 is a degree-@xmath3 slot and , if not , the decoding of slot @xmath12 is stopped .",
    "otherwise , the packet in slot @xmath12 is decoded and the interference from all its replicas canceled from the corresponding past slots .",
    "the receiver then proceeds to iteratively find any degree-@xmath3 slots in its memory , decode the packets in these slots , and cancel the interference of all replicas of the decoded packets .",
    "this process continues until no new degree-@xmath3 slots are found or a maximum number of iterations is reached .      in , when a degree-@xmath1 user joins the system it waits until the next slot and transmits a first replica in that slot .",
    "this enforces users to be slot - synchronous .",
    "the remaining @xmath13 replicas are distributed uniformly within the @xmath14 subsequent slots .",
    "similarly to , @xmath10 is the frame length of .",
    "however , contrary to , slots are not arranged in global frames .",
    "we say that a user is active during the @xmath10 slots following the slot where it joins the system and , accordingly , we call the @xmath10 slots where a user is active its _ local frame_. note that a user is not active in the slot where it joins the system , but only during the @xmath15 slots it can transmit in . because a user always transmits in the first slot of its local frame , we call this system .",
    "decoding of is performed in a similar way as for , with the only difference that the receiver needs to consider not only the slots of a current frame , but all slots of the entire history of the system . in practice",
    ", the receiver can not consider infinitely many slots and has a finite memory .",
    "we denote by @xmath16 the size of the receiver memory in number of slots .",
    "a finite @xmath16 creates the notion of a _ sliding - window _ decoder .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that increasing @xmath16 beyond @xmath17 does not improve performance in general .",
    "we let @xmath18 denote the number of active users in the @xmath12th slot , which is poisson - distributed with mean @xmath19 .",
    "the active users in slot @xmath12 are all users that joined the system in slots @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "we consider two different models for the initialization of the system , i.e. , for @xmath21 .",
    "the first model assumes that there are no active users at @xmath22 . in this case",
    "@xmath23 and we say that a _ boundary effect _ is present for this model .",
    "effectively , this means that the @xmath14 first slots of the system have lower average degree than the rest .",
    "the second model assumes that there are already @xmath11 active users at @xmath22 .",
    "are considered .",
    "note that the users already active at slot @xmath24 will have a worse plr than users joining at or after @xmath24 , since all of their replicas may not be available .",
    "furthermore , users already active at @xmath25 will affect the plr of users joining at @xmath26 by causing further interference .",
    "] thus , @xmath27 for this model , all considered slots have the same average degree .",
    "the system with boundary effect corresponds to a system where the receiver is present at the very start of the communication or , potentially , a system with periods of low load .",
    "a good example is satellite networks , where the receiver , i.e. , the satellite , is naturally present at the beginning of the communication .",
    "another example is road side infrastructures in a vehicular network as the intended receivers . on the other hand ,",
    "the model with no boundary effect is useful for systems where the receiver joins an already ongoing communication , e.g. , a vehicle in an all - to - all broadcast vehicular network where vehicles exchange messages between each other , as considered in @xcite .",
    "a vehicle will join and leave local networks with ongoing communication as it is moving .",
    "for the same reason , this model is also practical for devices in a device - to - device communication network .",
    "in addition to the initialization models described above , we introduce a second model for the selection of slots for transmission aside from that of , where a degree-@xmath1 user selects all @xmath1 slots for transmission randomly from the local frame .",
    "we call this system .",
    "is more similar to and provides a simplified analysis in some cases .",
    "however , we remark that is more practical and , as it is shown later , performs better in general .",
    "therefore , the main focus of this paper is on .    in all",
    ", we consider four models for , i.e. , , , , and .",

    "slots filled with green represent packets of degree-2 users and slots filled with blue represents packets of degree-3 users .",
    "the delay of each user is indicated by a number in the slot in which it is decoded .",
    "furthermore , the four striped green slots in the second frame of the example collide in such a way that the packets in these slots can not be decoded .",
