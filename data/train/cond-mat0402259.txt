    "a wide variety of linear electrostatic waves are known to propagate in plasmas @xcite .",
    "it is now established that the inherent nonlinearity of electrostatic dispersive media gives birth to remarkable new phenomena , in particular related to the formation and stable propagation of long - lived nonlinear structures , when a balance between nonlinearity and dispersion is possible @xcite . since about a decade ago",
    ", plasma wave theories have received a new boost after the prediction ( and subsequent experimental confirmation ) of the existence of new oscillatory modes , associated with charged dust - grain motion in dust - contaminated plasmas , as well as the possibility for an important modification of existing modes due to the presence of charged dust grains @xcite .",
    "a unique new feature associated to these dusty ( or complex ) plasmas ( dp ) is the existence of new strongly - coupled charged matter configurations , held responsible for a plethora of new phenomena e.g. phase transitions , crystallization , melting etc . , and",
    "possibly even leading to the formation of dust - layers ( dp crystals ) when the inter - grain potential energy far exceeds the average dust kinetic energy ; a link has thus been established between plasma physics and solid state physics @xcite .",
    "these dust bravais - type quasi - lattices , which are typically formed in the sheath region in low  temperature dusty plasma discharges , and remain suspended above the negative electrode due to a balance between the electric and gravity forces @xcite , are known to support harmonic excitations ( acoustic modes ) in both longitudinal and transverse - shear ( horizontal - plane ) directions , as well as optical - mode - like oscillations in the vertical ( off - plane ) direction @xcite .    the longitudinal dust - lattice waves ( ldlw ) are reminiscent of waves ( ` phonons ' ) propagating in atomic chains , which are long known to be dominated by nonlinear phenomena , due to the intrinsic nonlinearities of inter - atomic interaction mechanisms and/or on - site substrate potentials @xcite .",
    "these phenomena have been associated with a wealth of phenomena , e.g. dislocations in crystals , energy localization , charge and information transport in bio - molecules and dna strands , coherent signal transmission in electric lines , optical pulse propagation and many more @xcite . even though certain well - known nonlinear mechanisms , e.g. shock formation , electrostatic pulse propagation and instabilities , have been thoroughly investigated in weakly - coupled ( gas - like ) dusty plasmas @xcite , the theoretical investigation of the relevance of such phenomena with waves in dp crystals is still in a pre - mature stage ; apart from the pioneering works of melands@xcite , who first derived a korteweg - devries ( kdv ) equation @xcite associated with longitudinal dust - lattice oscillations , shukla @xcite , who predicted the formation of dust cavitons due to lattice dynamical coupling to surrounding ions , and the investigation of related nonlinear amplitude modulation effects by amin _",
    "@xcite a little later , not much has been done in the direction of a systematic elucidation of the relevance of dust - lattice waves being described by the known model nonlinear wave equations .",
    "it should , however , be stressed that some recent attempts to trace the signature of nonlinearity in experiments @xcite have triggered an effort to interpret these results in terms of coherent structure propagation @xcite , essentially along the physical ideas suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we aim at reviewing the procedure employed in the derivation of a nonlinear evolution equation for longitudinal dust grain motion in dp lattices , and discussing the characteristics of the solutions .",
    "emphasis is made on the methodology , in a quite exhaustive manner , in close relation with previous results on atomic chains , yet always focusing on the particular features of dp crystals ; we will discuss , in particular :    - the physical assumptions underlying the continuum approximation ;    - the choise of truncation scheme , when departing from the discrete lattice picture ;    - the long - range electrostatic interactions , differentiating dp crystals from ordinary classical atomic chains ( spring models ) ;    - the physical relation between different solutions obtained . some of the results presented here are closely related to well - known previous results , yet enriched with a new analytical set of coefficients allowing for any assumed range of site - to - site interactions and any analytical form of the interaction potential .",
    "the present study is , therefore , valid in both short and long- debye length dp cases , and also aims at providing a general ` recipe ' which allows one , for instance , to assume a modified ( possibly non - debye - type ) potential form and obtain the corresponding set of formulae in a straightforward manner .",
    "in specific , we have in mind the modification of the inter - grain interactions due to ion flow in the sheath region surrounding the dust layer , which may even lead to the crystal being destabilized , according to recent studies from first principles @xcite .",
    "most of the results presented here are general and apply , in principle , to a sufficiently general class of chains of classical agents ( point masses ) coupled via arbitrary ( and possibly long - range ) interaction laws .",
    "nevertheless , our specific aim is to establish a first link between existing nonlinear theories and the description of longitudinal dust - lattice oscillatory grain motion in a dp crystal .",
    "at a first step , our description can not help being ` academic ' , and somewhat abstract : an ideal one  dimensional dp crystal is considered , i.e. a single , unidimensional , infinite - sized , dust - layer of identical ( in size , charge and mass ) dust grains situated at spatially periodic sites ( at equilibrium ) .",
    "effects associated with crystal asymmetries , defects , dust charging , ion - drag , dust mass variation and multiple dust - layer coupling , are left for further consideration @xcite .",
    "transverse ( off - plane ) motion , in particular , will be addressed in a future work .",
    "let us consider a layer of charged dust grains ( mass @xmath2 , charge @xmath3 , both assumed constant for simplicity ) forming a bravais lattice , of lattice constant @xmath4 .",
    "the hamiltonian of such a chain reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the position vector of the @xmath7th grain ; @xmath8 is a binary interaction potential function related to the electrostatic potential @xmath9 around the @xmath10th grain , and latexmath:[$r_{nm } =    @xmath7th and @xmath10th grains .",
    "we shall limit ourselves to considering the _ longitudinal _ ( @xmath12 ) motion of the @xmath7th dust grain , which obeys @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the electric field ; the usual _ ad hoc _ damping term is introduced in the left - hand - side ( lhs ) , involving the damping rate @xmath15 , to account for the dust grain collisions with neutrals .",
    "note that a one - dimensional ( 1d ) dp layer is considered here , but the generalization to a two - dimensional ( 2d ) grid is straightforward . at a first step ,",
    "we have omitted the external force term @xmath16 , often introduced to account for the initial laser excitation and/or the parabolic confinement which ensures horizontal lattice equilibrium in experiments @xcite .",

    "as expected ( cf . the discussion above ) , both the ekdv and bq  related compressive excitations are similar in magnitude to the kdv  related anti - kink for near  sonic velocity ( i.e. near @xmath271 ) .",

    "these questions may be answered by appropriate experiments and , possibly , also be investigated by numerical simulations . from a purely theoretical point of view",

    ", one easily sees that @xmath276 , so this requirement is indeed fulfilled for propagation velocities @xmath181 .",
    "however , for higher values of @xmath153 , the ( narrower ) soliton will be subject to a variety of effects e.g. shape distortion , wave radiation etc .",
    ", due to the intrinsic lattice discreteness .",
    "these effects have been investigated in solid state physics @xcite and may be considered with respect to dp crystals at a later stage .",
    "let us briefly point out that narrow kink - shaped lattice excitations have been numerically shown to propagate with no considerable loss of energy , in a quite general monoatomic lattice model @xcite .",
    "also worth mentioning is the work of rosenau @xcite who derived an improved version of the boussinesq equation ( the i - bq eq . ) in a quasi - continuum limit .",
    "the i - bq equation , which bears the general structure of ( [ gb ] ) upon replacing @xmath277 therein by @xmath278 ( yet with different coefficient definitions ) , is not integrable and bears solitary wave solutions which do not collide elastically ; nevertheless , it was numerically shown to be more stable than the bq equation , and was argued to model discrete lattice dynamics more efficiently , upon comparison of theoretical predictions to exact numerical results @xcite .",
    "further examination of such effects may be carried out in dust - lattices , once our feedback from experiments has sufficiently determined the relevance of the issue in real dp crystals , i.e. typical excitation width , dynamics etc .",
    "it should be underlined that the possibility for the existence of breather solitons , anticipated above , establishes a link between complex plasma ` solid state ' modeling and the framework of discreteness - related localized excitations ( discrete breathers @xcite , intrinsic localized modes @xcite ) , which have recently received increasing interest among researchers in the nonlinear dynamics community .",
    "these localized modes , which are due to coupling anharmonicity and are stabilized by lattice discreteness , have been shown to exist in frequency regions forbidden to ordinary lattice waves and account for energy localization in highly discrete real crystals , where continuum theories fail .",
    "the relevance of this framework to dust crystals appears to be an interesting open area for investigation .",
    "as a final interesting issue involved in the nonlinear dynamics of longitudinal lattice oscillations , let us mention the nonlinear modulation of the amplitude of dust - lattice waves , a well - known mechanism related to harmonic generation and , possibly , the modulational instability of waves propagating in lattices , eventually leading to modulated wave packet energy localization via the formation of envelope solitons @xcite .",
    "this framework , which was recently also investigated with respect to low - frequency ( dust - acoustic , dust - ion acoustic ) electrostatic waves in dusty plasmas @xcite , has been partly analyzed , on the basis of the melands@xcite model in ref .",
    "the authors relied on a truncated boussinesq equation , in the form of ( [ gb ] ) for @xmath253 , and succeeded in predicting the occurrence of modulational instability in ldl waves in dp crystals and the formation of envelope structures .",
    "nevertheless , the nonlinearity coefficient @xmath182 omitted therein seems to compete with @xmath183 in ( [ gb ] ) ( notice the different signs ) and is rather expected to affect significantly the wave s stability profile .",
    "it should be stressed that these localized envelope excitations result from a physical mechanism which is intrinsically different from the one related to the small  amplitude excitations described in this paper ; see the discussion in ref .",
    ". an extended study of this modulation nonlinear mechanism is in row and will be reported elsewhere , for clarity and conciseness .    as a final comment",
    ", we may speculate on the role of damping , herewith ignored , on the dynamics of dust - lattice waves .",
    "it is known that weak damping may balance nonlinearity , leading to the formation of shock wave fronts , as predicted in refs . @xcite and confirmed by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was recently shown that the same mechanism may result in the formation of large - amplitude wide - shaped solitary waves , which may later break into a ( gradually damped ) train of solitons or a wavepacket depending on physical parameters @xcite .",
    "we see that friction , yet weak , may play a predominant role in the life and death of localized excitations ; this effect definitely deserves paying close attention with respect to waves propagating in dust crystals .",
    "again , one would expect phenomenological theories followed by appropriately designed experiments to elucidate the friction mechanisms inherent in longitudinal dust - lattice wave propagation , in view of a more complete description than the one provided by the conservative model adopted here .",
    "this work was devoted to an investigation of the relevance of existing model nonlinear theories to the dynamics of longitudinal oscillations in anharmonic chains , with emphasis on dust - lattice excitations in ( strongly - coupled ) complex plasma crystals .",
    "taking into account an arbitrary interaction potential and long - range interactions , we have rigorously shown that both compressive and rarefactive kink - shaped ( shock - like ) excitations may form and propagate in the lattice , depending basically on the mechanism of interaction between grains located at each site .",
    "these excitations are effectively modeled by either kdv- or boussinesq - type equations , whose analytic form was presented and whose qualitative and quantitative differences were discussed . in any case , the theory predicts coherent wave propagation above the lattice s ` sound ' speed , in agreement with previous theoretical works and experimental observations ( in both atomic and dust - lattices ) . it may be appropriate to mention that subsonic soliton propagation in monoatomic chains was also numerically considered and shown to be feasible in the past @xcite",
    "let us point out that the model used here to pass from a discrete description to the continuum ( long - wavelength ) limit is quite generic , so possible modification via refined nonlinear equations may readily be obtained from it , for future consideration .",
    "furthermore , we have discussed the possibility of the formation of breather modes and envelope excitations , as a consequence of modulated wave packet instability , anticipating their link to discrete nonlinear theories of localized modes , left for future consideration ; despite their analytical complexity , these models may , in principle , be of relevance in dust crystals due to the finite dimensions of the chain and its intrinsic spatial discreteness . finally , the possible role played by dissipation mechanisms has been briefly discussed .",
    "the present study relies on , and aims at extending , previous theories on both anharmonic atomic chains and dusty plasma crystals .",
    "we hope to have succeeded in reviewing the former ( extending them to the case of long - range electrostatic interactions ) and generalizing the latter ( which are still in an early stage ) .",
    "hopefully , our predictions may be confirmed by appropriately set - up experiments , with the ambition of throwing some light in the relatively new and challenging field of strongly - coupled complex plasmas and dust - lattice dynamics .",
