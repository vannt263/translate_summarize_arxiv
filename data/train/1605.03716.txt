    "ribbons are ubiquitous in the physical world @xcite . recently",
    ", they have received a great deal of attention .",
    "this is true , in particular , for mbius strips and helical bands , @xcite .",
    "this renewed interest is also due to their manifold potential applications , which range from physics / electro - technology to chemistry / nano - technology @xcite .",
    "geometrically a ribbon is a strip of thickness @xmath1 , width @xmath2 , and centerline length @xmath3 , with @xmath4 . because of anisotropic pre - strains , inhomogeneous swelling , plastic deformations or differential growth",
    ", ribbons may not have a stress - free configuration .",
    "hyper - elastic theories for these bodies have been recently formulated in terms of deformations that are measured with respect to a reference metric rather than a reference configuration @xcite .",
    "several plate models for these materials have been obtained by studying the @xmath0-limit of various scalings of the energy , as @xmath1 goes to zero . in particular , in  @xcite the energy density of the deduced model is a quadratic function of the difference between the second fundamental form of the deformed configuration and a `` natural '' curvature tensor .",
    "this tensor either denotes the second fundamental form of the natural ( stress - free ) configuration or a target curvature tensor . in the latter case ,",
    "residual stress arises from the geometrical frustration involved in the attempt to achieve the target curvature : as a result , the ribbon is naturally twisted , even in the absence of external forces or prescribed boundary conditions . by controlling the `` natural '' curvature tensor",
    "one may select the shape spontaneously attained by the ribbon : this is the focus of several studies aimed at designing new structures @xcite .",
    "given that also @xmath5 , after having let @xmath1 go to zero , it is interesting to find one - dimensional models that characterize very narrow strips , by considering the limit as @xmath2 tends to zero .",
    "a limit energy for homogeneous , isotropic , elastic ribbons with a rectangular stress - free configuration was put forward by sadowsky  @xcite , see  @xcite for a recent english translation .",
    "this energy , now known as the sadowsky energy , depends on the curvature and torsion of the centerline of the band and it is singular at the points where the curvature vanishes .",
    "a formal justification of the sadowsky energy was given by wunderlich @xcite . only very recently , in @xcite , it has been proved by means of @xmath0-convergence that the sadowsky energy is correct for `` large '' curvature of the centerline of the strip , while for `` small '' curvature the correct limit energy is significantly different from the sadowsky energy .",
    "we shall further address this point at the end of the introduction .    before discussing the contents of our paper we mention that one - dimensional models could be obtained from the three - dimensional theory also by letting @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "go to zero simultaneously . within the non - linear theory of elasticity for homogeneous bodies with a stress - free configuration several limit energies , corresponding to different scalings ,",
    "have been obtained in @xcite .    in the geometrically frustrated setting , one",
    "- dimensional models have been formally deduced from two - dimensional models in  @xcite by following the procedure of wunderlich @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a two - dimensional energy that coincides with that obtained in  @xcite by letting @xmath1 go to zero ( see also  @xcite ) and the same problem considered in @xcite but with more general symmetries .",
    "we assume the reference configuration to be given by a sequence of two - dimensional `` thin '' regions parametrized by @xmath2 .",
    "these regions are not necessarily rectangular , they may have a curved centerline and a smoothly varying width .",
    "the admissible deformations are isometries and their energy depends quadratically on the difference between the second fundamental form of the deformed configuration and a `` natural '' curvature tensor . by letting the parameter @xmath6 go to zero , under appropriate assumptions on the limit behaviour of the `` natural '' curvature tensor , we identify the @xmath0-limit of the ( suitably re - scaled ) sequence of energy functionals in a topology that ensures compactness of the sequence of minimizers .",
    "our result not only provides a rigorous derivation of the energy of a very narrow ribbon , but also corrects several formal justifications that are found in the literature .",
    "in addition , we allow the energy density to be anisotropic : an intrinsic anisotropy and not simply the one scattered by the presence of the `` natural '' curvature tensor as in @xcite . limit models within this generality , as far as we know , have not been deduced , not even formally .",
    "we also prove a relaxation result for quadratic functionals with a determinant constraint ( see section [ sec_relax ] ) , that is of interest in its own right and is a fundamental ingredient to deal with the nonlinear isometry constraint in weak topologies .",
    "the limit energy that we deduce depends on three vector fields ( directors ) @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , where @xmath7 is tangent to the limit deformation , @xmath8 represents the `` transversal '' orientation of the strip , and @xmath9 is orthogonal to @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the system of directors may not be orthonormal ; in fact , they are related to the geometry of the reference configuration by means of a covariant basis @xmath10 through the constraints @xmath11 the first constraint implies that the ribbon is unsherable and inextensible , while the second constraint is a consequence of the intrinsic nature of the geodesic curvature .",
    "the energy functional is then given by @xmath12 where @xmath3 is the length of the centerline of the strip .",
    "the quantities @xmath13 and @xmath14 are usually called , within the theory of rods , bending and twisting , respectively . denoting the energy density of the plate by @xmath15 , the limit energy density @xmath16",
    "is defined in two steps : first , two positive constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 are defined by @xmath19 and then the energy density @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 denote the contravariant basis in the reference configuration , i.e. , @xmath23 , while @xmath24 characterizes the limit behaviour of the `` natural '' curvature tensor , and @xmath25 denote the positive and negative part of @xmath26 .    in the very particular case considered by sadowsky  @xcite and wunderlich @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 equal to the identity , the energy density reduces to @xmath30   4\\tau^2 & \\mbox{if }   \\mu^2 \\le   \\tau^2 , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] and coincides with that found in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath31 and @xmath32 are interpreted as the curvature and the torsion of the centerline of the band , this function agrees with the sadowsky energy density only in the regime @xmath33 ; this is the `` large '' curvature regime to which we alluded earlier in the introduction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_energy ]",
    "we introduce the sequence of energy functionals and in section  [ sec_rescaling ] we rescale them on a fixed domain . in section  [ sec_comp ]",
    "we study the compactness properties of sequences with bounded energy and state the @xmath0-convergence result .",
    "section  [ sec_relax ] is devoted to the relaxation of quadratic functionals with a constraint on the determinant .",
    "this result is the crucial ingredient for the identification of the correct @xmath0-limit and is used in the proof of both the liminf and the limsup inequality .",
    "the construction of the recovery sequence also requires several geometric and approximation results for isometric immersions , that are proved in section  [ pro ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ proofs ] we prove the @xmath0-convergence result .",
    "we consider an inextensible elastic ribbon whose configurations in the three - dimensional space are isometric to a planar region @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a small parameter .",
    "the region @xmath36 will be taken as reference configuration and its geometry will be specified below .",
    "any smooth deformation @xmath37 will satisfy the isometry constraint @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the @xmath40 identity matrix . in coordinates , reads @xmath41 .",
    "we denote by @xmath42 the unit normal to @xmath43 , and by @xmath44 the second fundamental form of @xmath43 .",
    "it is defined by @xmath45 or , equivalently , by @xmath46 .",
    "we assume the energy density of the strip to be quadratic and to depend on the second fundamental form , but we neither assume the material to be isotropic nor the reference configuration to be stress free . let @xmath47 be a symmetric tensor field that either represents the second fundamental form of a `` natural '' configuration or a target curvature tensor field not necessarily corresponding to a configuration ( this latter case is usually addressed as non - euclidean ribbons ) .",
    "the bending rigidity is taken into account by a linear map @xmath48 from @xmath49 into itself .",
    "we assume @xmath48 to be symmetric , i.e. , @xmath50 for every @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , we assume @xmath48 to be positive definite , i.e. , there exists a constant @xmath52 such that @xmath53 for every @xmath54 .",
    "the energy of the ribbon takes the form @xmath55 its domain of definition is the set of deformations @xmath56 that satisfy the constraint  .      to define the region @xmath34 we introduce the rectangle @xmath58 , where @xmath39 denotes the interval @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "then @xmath61 where @xmath62 is an injective orientation preserving map of class @xmath63 .",
    "we assume that @xmath64 so that the length of the curve @xmath65 in @xmath34 is also equal to @xmath3 .",

    "let @xmath77 be the function @xmath78 that maps the fixed rectangular region into the reference configuration .",

    "this can be rewritten in a more explicit form as @xmath93 the energy in terms of the rescaled deformation is given by @xmath94 , defined as @xmath95 where we have set @xmath96 we note that the relation between the bending energy and the rescaled energy is @xmath97 .",

    "lemma [ compactness ] naturally extends to a more intrinsic setting , where the deformation @xmath111 is considered as the natural variable and the energy is defined on the class of isometric immersions of the surface @xmath112 endowed with a given riemannian metric @xmath113 ( which in the present case coincides with @xmath114 ) . in this setting formulae and follow from the continuity of @xmath113 and of the metric connection ( christoffel symbols ) defined by @xmath113 .",
    "a similar remark applies to theorem  [ gamma](i ) below .",
    "details on this general approach will be given in the forthcoming paper  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath115 be a sequence satisfying .",
