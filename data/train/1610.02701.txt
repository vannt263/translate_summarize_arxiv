    "since its introduction by kolmogorov in dynamical systems , entropy has been an invaluable tool for understanding system behavior .",
    "ornstein s isomorphism theorem , which entirely characterizes  up to isomorophism  a class of systems ( bernoulli ) according to their entropy , further solidified its importance in the dynamical systems community @xcite , @xcite .",
    "broadly , entropy captures uncertainty growth as a system evolves .",
    "entropy itself has a history which precedes its inclusion in dynamical systems  notably in thermodynamics , and much later information theory as well  and this intuition about uncertainty growth corresponds , at least in the development of the concept , to entropy in other disciplines .",
    "topological entropy generally measures the exponential growth in information needed to approximate trajectories on a finite time scale  equivalently , to cover the flow with the initial data of an open cover  or the growth in complexity of a system acting on finite measurable sets .",
    "the latter idea corresponds to kolmogorov s original definition @xcite and shares a striking resemblance to the entropy of information theory which shannon introduced roughly ten years earlier @xcite .",
    "adler s introduction of entropy  the entropy approximating trajectories  appeared first as a mild extension of kolmogorov s entropy , quantifying a map s expansion according to how it increases ( by joins ) a minimal number of sets needed to cover a compact space @xcite .",
    "bowen , on the other hand , considered topological entropy by quantifying the increase in number of points whose flow can be separated by a small distance at some time in their initial segments @xcite .",
    "these definitions are all interrelated , and the arguments laying out their connections can be found unified in @xcite .",
    "most results in entropy are for autonomous systems , as time dependence in the dynamics introduces complexities which require new methods to understand @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our present work on switched systems is an initial investigation into some of those complexities .",
    "entropy has played a useful role in control theory , where information flow appears in maintaining or inducing key properties through actuators and a network of sensors .",
    "original applications of entropy tried quantifying the minimal data rates for guaranteeing the possibility of stabilizability , observability , or controllability @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these approaches extended original entropy considerations , notably in allowing for the evolution of a system in a noncompact space , but still described to the complexity of the system ( as it evolves ) in the state space . later in @xcite ,",
    "entropy was used to quantify the growth in number of open loop controls needed to span ( in another sense ) the space of controls .",
    "this work , and similarly @xcite and @xcite , used entropy in the setting of continuous time , whereas most previous investigations focused on discrete time systems .",
    "also , the application of topological entropy in the dual problem of state estimation has been studied in , e.g. ,   @xcite and the recent work  @xcite .    of interest to us in the class of dynamical systems",
    "are _ switched systems _ , those which are `` piecewise time invariant , '' formally given by a family of systems with a switching signal  usually dependent on time  which determines which system is active @xcite .",
    "switched systems provide a very nice next - step extension beyond time - invariant systems and insight on how to broach the _ prima facie _ intractable abstractness of general nonlinear time - varying systems .",
    "notably , nice properties which individual subsystems may enjoy  such as stability , or equivalently all negative real part eigenvalues  may not hold for the entire switched system .",
    "stability of switched systems has been extensively studied , and among the various techniques for understanding stability are the use of lyapunov functions , constraints on the frequency of switching , and _ commutation relations _ among the subsystems .",
    "we explain this last approach .",
    "suppose we are given a _ linear _",
    "switched system whose dynamics are comprised of finitely many matrices .",
    "we can consider the lie algebra generated by these matrices  i.e .",
    ",  the set of matrices generated by taking brackets of a finite set of matrices , brackets of those , and so on  and ask whether any structure can be used to determine conditions for stability of the switched system .",
    "indeed , it turns out that if the lie algebra is solvable ( which means iterated commutators of a certain form eventually vanish ) and each individual system is stable , then the switched system is stable @xcite . in other words , stability is invariant ( or `` stable '' ) under any switching signal provided stability of the underlying systems . in concrete terms , solvability corresponds to the existence of a change of basis transformation which _ simultaneously _ takes each matrix to an upper triangular one @xcite .",
    "solvability generalizes commutativity of matrices , and the latter can be easily seen to directly imply the preservation of stability : by stacking the solution for each system together , there is a uniform bound on the number of switches _ in the solution_. naturally things become more complicated for nonlinear systems , but results tying nonlinear systems to the lie algebra structure can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "research into robustness conditions can be found in @xcite , and the works of @xcite investigate state feedback which induces simultaneous triangularizability in the closed loop .",
    "other references to switched systems can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we are interested in understanding entropy in switched systems .",
    "our motivations are twofold .",
    "first of all , to our knowledge , little is understood about the problem of computing entropy in switched systems .",
    "secondly , we expect that entropy of switched systems may elucidate how to control switched systems operating over finite data - rate communication channels .",
    "though the linear time - invariant ( lti ) case is completely understood  there is a tight relation between entropy and the minimal data rate required for `` good '' properties  not much is known about corresponding results in the case of switched systems .",
    "work in this direction has been started in @xcite and @xcite and our work with entropy aims at contributing to and developing these efforts .",
    "our work is confined to _ linear _ switched systems .",
    "there are a few reasons for this .",
    "first , entropy  unlike stability  is not a local property of solutions .",
    "entropy measures , more or less , the exponential expansion of a system , and exponential behavior is through and through a feature of linear systems . secondly , linear systems provide an amenable context for the use of commutation relations , which indeed grounds the bulk of our machinery .",
    "our results include the following .",
    "first , we investigate entropy properties of scalar switched systems , the computation for which is the basis of our entropy considerations in higher dimensions . for each subsystem , we define a function of time which represents the percentage time of activation on that time interval , and use the limit supremum as the upper average time percent of activation .",
    "we use these values as weights on the eigenvalues of their respective systems , and take the sum to represent the upper average exponent of the solution .",
    "we show that this quantity is in fact the entropy of the scalar switched system .",
    "we then work out a derivation of the entropy expression for continuous - time lti systems which , though well known , is not well documented in the literature .",
    "we fuse this into a study of the nonscalar switched case , which forms our main results .",
    "we provide a general lower bound on entropy independent of structure ( and therefore weak ) .",
    "we then consider bounds on entropy using eigenvalue analysis given certain lie structure , including commutativity and solvability .",
    "the bound is given by the following : assuming solvability of the lie algebra which the matrices of the switched system generate , there exists a single change of basis matrix making all of them upper triangular .",
    "each row represents a scalar linear system , whose state is given by the diagonal entry and `` inputs '' the off diagonal entries .",
    "we show that the effects of expansion in each direction are maximized in the first row , with the following relation : the @xmath0-th state solution  as input  expands at the exponential rate given by the sum of entropies of scalar states starting at the first state and ending at itself .",
    "thus the first state s entropy appears @xmath1 times , the second appears @xmath2 times , and so on , so that the entropy of the whole system is bounded above by the sum of the scalar entropies of the @xmath0-th subsystem ( without inputs , or equivalently weighted sum of diagonal entries ) multiplied by @xmath3 , as @xmath0 runs up to the dimension of the system . note that in order to compute this upper bound , the system must be first brought into the normalized ( simultaneous triangularizable ) form , as each state s entropy depends on which eigenvalues are associated with it",
    "the structure of the thesis is as follows . in  2 , we review basic definitions of topological entropy and switched systems . in ",
    "3 we provide an initial step towards computing entropy of switched systems . in  4 , we recount entropy for lti systems , and provide a proof in continuous time .",
    "the final chapter ,  5 , includes the main results on nonscalar switched systems .",
    "this includes a lower bound given by a weighted sum of the eigenvalues from each subsystem .",
    "we provide bounds  both lower and upper  in the case where the system can be simultaneously diagonalized , and end with an upper bound on a system which is simultaneously triangularizable .",
    "consider a time - varying dynamical system @xmath4 evolving as @xmath5 , with @xmath6 , and fix a compact set @xmath7 of initial conditions containing the origin , which we assume to be an equilibrium point @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 denote solution of system at time @xmath10 starting from initial condition @xmath11 .",
    "when the system is fixed , we will drop the dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath13 , or if the system depends on some parameter  as a switched system will depend on the switching signal @xmath14we may only include the parameter to disambiguate . for @xmath15 , we let @xmath16 the set of points where the solution ends up after @xmath17-units of time starting from a point in @xmath18 .",

    "this base is more amenable to our purposes in that our setting is in continuous time , so the choice will eliminate the need for an extraneous multiplicative factor in our results , but translating these notions for the sake of encoding ( say , with binary strings ) may require using base @xmath39 .    in the definition above , we fixed some compact set @xmath18 but were rather cavalier about which one to fix .",
    "for simplicity in the computations to follow , we take @xmath18 to be a closed ball ( cube ) in @xmath28 of integer length . as will become evident in those computations ,",
    "the size of @xmath18 really does not matter , but what may not be as obvious is that the shape does not either .",
    "it is a technical construction to verify this , and we omit the proof for simplicity as it elucidates little in terms of entropy .",
    "suffice it to say that for `` oddly shaped '' sets ( e.g.  cantor - like nowhere dense closed ones ) , we can embed them into nice ones , and guarantee a uniform bound , dependent only on dimension , for the multiplicative factor on the cardinality of spanning sets .",
    "this factor disappears asymptotically , and we will see why in the computations .    there is a second definition of entropy which we will use briefly in our initial investigation .",

    "we let @xmath46 denote the _ maximal _ cardinality of a @xmath22-separated set and again define entropy as @xmath47 one can quickly check that these definitions agree ; a maximal @xmath22-separated set is also @xmath22-spanning so @xmath48 , and an @xmath45-ball does not contain points separated by distance greater than @xmath49 , so @xmath50 , c.f .",
    "@xcite,@xcite .",

    "as switching does not in general preserve stability for a system whose individual dynamics are stable , we will use entropy to measure the emergence of instability in a switched system .    to investigate properties of switched entropy",

    "the reason that switching can destabilize otherwise stable systems is that it mixes the evolution of solutions from different eigen__spaces__. because the geometry of mixing is simply intractable , our approach is to find conditions on the shared structure of individual dynamics which allow us to elicit information about the entropy from the eigenvalues of each system .",
