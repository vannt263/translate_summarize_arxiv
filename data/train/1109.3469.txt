    "it is now generally believed that galaxies evolve in a hierarchical fashion , with galaxies growing through mergers .",
    "furthermore , evidence suggests that most , if not all , galaxies contain a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) at their center @xcite .",
    "therefore , in a galactic merger the force of dynamical friction will act to bring each smbh toward the center of the new mass distribution , first forming a dual smbh ( separations of several kpc ) , then a gravitationally bound system ( sub - pc separations ) and eventually merging to form a single , more massive smbh .",
    "the amount of time spent in each stage is dependent upon the efficiency of the processes carrying away angular momentum from the system @xcite . at large separations ( @xmath7 pc ) , the primary force acting on the smbhs is dynamical friction from the surrounding gas and dust . as the smbhs form a binary system ( i.e. harden ) , ejection of stars becomes most important .",
    "finally at close separations ( @xmath8 pc ) , gravitational radiation will become the most important mechanism of energy loss @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations show that in a wet merger ( i.e. , where the merging galaxies possess a significant fraction of gas and dust ) , tidal interactions are effective at funneling the gas and dust toward the center of the merging system where the two smbhs are located , providing fuel for enhanced accretion @xcite .",
    "this process is thought to be a possible mechanism for initiating an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) or quasar phase @xcite , and the existence of a dual agn ( two actively accreting smbhs within the same galaxy ) is a natural prediction of this merger fueling model .",
    "therefore , identifying pairs of smbhs in the process of merging is extremely important for probing the link between agn activity and galaxy evolution .",
    "unfortunately , observational evidence of such systems has proven very difficult to obtain .",
    "large samples of binary quasars exist as evidence for quasar clustering and mutual triggering @xcite .",
    "however , these are typically at large projected separations ( @xmath9 kpc ) and thus generally only represent the earliest stage of binary smbh evolution .",
    "most confirmed cases of dual smbhs at smaller separations ( between 10 kpc and 1 kpc ) have been identified in local ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) as pairs of x - ray point sources @xcite , with much of the optical emission obscured by the heavy internal extinction common in ulirgs . in some cases",
    "the obscuration is so heavy that only one nucleus is visible , thus highlighting the difficulty that dusty , merging systems present to identification of dual agn .",
    "additionally , the close ( 7 pc separation ) binary smbh system in the radio galaxy 0402 + 379 was identified from very long baseline array ( vlba ) observations @xcite . while the excellent spatial resolution achievable in the radio regime",
    "makes the vlba capable of detecting close binaries , this technique is time consuming and not suited to identifying a large sample of sources .    in the past few years",
    ", several interesting individual examples of dual / binary smbh candidates have been identified from single - epoch optical spectra of agn or quasars showing double - peaked emission lines . the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )",
    "spectral archive @xcite has been a fruitful database for such identifications .",
    "however , these objects do not represent a homogeneous class , and thus the physical interpretation of many of them , based on single - epoch fiber spectra alone , remains ambiguous .",
    "for example , the sources sdss",
    "j153636.22 + 044127.0 ( j1536 + 0441 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and sdss j105041.35 + 345631.3 ( j1050 + 3456 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show double - peaked , broad balmer emission lines ( h@xmath10 , h@xmath11 and h@xmath12 ) , which resemble two broad line regions ( blrs ) with significant velocity differences ( @xmath13 km s@xmath2 )",
    ". however , these objects might instead be members of the sub - class of agn / quasars called ` double - peaked emitters ' ( also known as ` disk - emitters ' ) where the double peaks of the balmer lines are attributed to emission from a single accretion disk . line emission contribution from an accretion disk is suggested by the extended wings in the balmer emission lines ( particularly evident in h@xmath10 , e.g. @xcite ) which is a characteristic disk profile feature . on the other hand , these sources are extreme examples of ` disk emitters , ' and it has been shown that such strongly double - peaked balmer lines in quasars may represent cases in which the presence of a secondary smbh is effective at enhancing the double - peaked profile produced by the disk @xcite .",
    "one such object , 4c+22.25 , identified by @xcite as a candidate binary smbh , shows very high ( 8700 km s@xmath2 ) velocity offsets between the two peaks of the balmer emission lines ; it is therefore unlikely to be a ` disk - emitter ' as the velocity difference is several thousand km s@xmath2 larger than that of any known similar source ( see the sample of * ? ? ?",
    "these results demonstrate the diversity of double - peaked broad line profiles and emphasize that in a close binary smbh there are likely to be strong interactions between the smbhs and the accretion disks .",
    "a growing number of objects have been identified with narrow forbidden emission lines that are either offset from the systemic velocity or double - peaked in single - epoch spectra , many of which have been found through systematic searches for candidate dual agn , both in the deep2 galaxy redshift survey @xcite and sdss @xcite .",
    "specifically , objects have been identified as dual agn candidates because they show strongly double - peaked [ oiii]5007 lines @xcite , or double - peaks in all of the narrow lines , both permitted and forbidden , e.g. sdss 092712.65 + 294344.0 ( j0927 + 2943 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these double - peaks indicate two sets of narrow emission line regions ( nlrs ) , and are suggestive of dual agn with separations up to several kpc .",
    "these systems are excellent sources for study because , at the implied kpc - scale separations , the two putative agn can be resolved in two - dimensional spectroscopy and imaging .",
    "however , double - peaked narrow lines have been seen in a number of agn and quasars where other physical explanations have been favored .",
    "for example , nlrs are thought to have complex gas kinematics which may include radially flowing material capable of producing offset or double - peaked narrow emission lines @xcite . in particular",
    ", powerful radio galaxies often show complex , spatially extended nlrs with multiple components aligned along the radio axis ( see reviews of radio galaxies in @xcite and @xcite )",
    ". models for this alignment include reflection of the agn emission @xcite , jet - induced star formation @xcite , inverse compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons off the relativistic electrons in the radio jet @xcite , material out - flowing from an accetion disk or entrained in a radio jet @xcite , as well as a combination of shocks and photoionization by the central engine @xcite .",
    "there is an extensive literature on the spatially extended , kinematically complex nlrs of powerful radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "though radio galaxy nlrs often appear vaguely reminiscent of dual agn candidates , multiple agn are rarely suggested as possible interpretations of the complex radio galaxy nlrs .",
    "finally , simple geometrical interpretations have been invoked to explain double - peaked narrow lines in agn , such as a rotating , disk - shaped nlr or a single agn illuminating two nlrs @xcite .    developing a clear understanding of the physical process producing these often complex emission line profiles is important to both the search for dual agn and to further understand quasar / agn emission line regions in general . since it is clear that a number of physical processes other than a pair of agn can explain double - peaked emission lines ( broad and/or narrow ) , more information is necessary to entirely reject or confirm any one model . from single - epoch spectra",
    ", emission line ratios may be used as diagnostic tools to constrain the nature of the ionizing continuum producing each set of emission lines .",

    "interestingly , out of 168 sources detected in the field by @xcite , only thirteen have larger 0.5 - 10 kev fluxes and only seven are more obscured ( i.e. , have higher hardness ratios ) ; no brighter sources have higher hardness ratios .",

    "this approach yields a much better fit ( @xmath90 ) , as shown in figure [ sed_vfv]b .",
    "an unreddened low luminosity agn component is used to model the uv excess over the galaxy - host sed , while another agn component , intrinsically 10 times more luminous and with large amounts of obscuration ( @xmath91 ) , is used to model the mid - ir emission .",

    "the optical broad lines of the less luminous , unreddened agn ( with @xmath100 of the host luminosity ) would be too faint to be detectable @xcite , consistent with our observations .",

    "in this section , we discuss six physical scenarios which may account for the unusual double emission line peaks observed in the restframe optical / uv lines , and the morphology as evident from the images , particularly the lack of a double nucleus in the nirc2-ao image .",
    "these scenarios are a chance superposition , a rotating accretion disk , jet / cloud interactions , an unusual nlr geometry , accretion disk outflows , and a dual agn .",
    "similar explanations have been invoked for other dual agn candidates and sources with double - peaked or offset emission lines ( in particular , see the discussions of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) , though we elaborate upon them here .",
    "we discuss the applicability of each scenario to cxoj1426 + 35 , concluding that a dual agn is a viable explanation .",
    "a chance superposition of two unrelated sources has occasionally been posited as a possible interpretation of the multiple narrow emission lines seen in dual agn candidates .",
    "ignoring the fact that , in this case , the interpretation is rather forced since two systems with this little separation both physically and in velocity space are unlikely to be unrelated , we can use the surface density of agn to estimate the probability of such a chance superposition . using the sdss quasar catalogue @xcite to determine the surface density of luminous ( brighter than @xmath110 ) quasars at @xmath111 ( e.g. , a redshift bin equivalent to nearly one hundred times the velocity difference between the two systems )",

    "using the cluster surface density at the high end of the surface density distribution in @xcite , we find that the probability increases by a factor of @xmath113 , implying that even in a cluster this scenario is highly improbable .",
    "radio jets produced by the central active smbh are capable of introducing a variety of kinematics into the nlr .",
    "well - collimated jets can produce asymmetric and/or blueshifted narrow emission line profiles , and indeed jet / cloud interactions in the inner nlr have been used to explain the [ oiii ] blueshifts seen in some compact radio sources @xcite .",
    "if the redshifted jet is not obscured , this scenario can explain the double - peaked narrow emission lines of cxoj1426 + 35 , and this was shown to be the case for a previous dual agn candidate @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , some questions remain as to the capability of radio plasma to entrain the bulk of the nlr so that the velocity - shifted lines dominate in the emergent spectrum , rather than introduce instabilities that fragment the clouds .",
    "for example , @xcite discuss for another dual agn candidate the scenario in which only a single cloud interacts locally with each side of the jet , but find that the [ oiii]5007 line luminosity is not consistent with just two clouds , and we arrive at the same conclusion for cxoj1426 + 35 given its high [ oiii]5007 luminosity .",
    "however , an even tighter constraint on the possibility of a jet / cloud interaction in cxoj1426 + 35 is derived from the radio power corresponding to the radio detection limit ( section [ radio ] ) . the sample of radio sources in @xcite would have all been well - detected .",
    "though these are only 14 sources and do not represent all radio galaxies , they are useful for comparison as they show blueshifted [ oiii]5007 lines , presumably a result of local jet / cloud interactions in the inner nlr .",
    "if jet / cloud interactions are responsible for producing the double - peaked narrow emission lines , then cxoj1426 + 35 is likely to be a strong radio source , similar to the radio sources in @xcite , and would therefore have also been detected .",
    "however , the lack of a detection makes the presence of ( at least strong ) jet / cloud interactions highly unlikely .",
    "a rotating disk with a line emitting surface is capable of producing double - peaked emission .",
    "the relative positions of the peaks and the shape of the lines are dependent on geometrical factors which can enhance the effect , such as the orientation of the disk plane relative to the observer s line of sight , and the disk outer radius .",
    "since this disk model has been successfully applied to accretion disks around smbhs , providing a possible explanation for the asymmetric ( non - gaussian ) , broad and often double - peaked balmer emission lines of some agn and quasars , including some candidate binary smbhs ( see section [ intro ] ) , we consider this scenario for cxoj1426 + 35 but find that it is unlikely : the 2-d spectroscopy reveals that the line peaks are at a projected separation of @xmath114 kpc .",
    "this is much larger than the sub - pc sizes of such disks based on smbh masses and h@xmath10 line profiles @xcite and makes the single accretion disk interpretation of cxoj1426 + 35 unphysical .",
    "one may imagine a disk - shaped nlr which can , in principle , produce the double - peaked lines in a way analogous to the rotating disk in section [ rotating ] .",
    "one advantage of this scenario is that nlrs are much larger than accretion disks and could explain the observed separation . while a size of 5.5 kpc is large for a typical seyfert galaxy @xcite , luminous quasars",
    "have been observed with nlrs of up to 10 kpc @xcite .",
    "the total [ oiii]5007 luminosity of cxoj1426 + 35 is nearly an order of magnitude larger than that of the brightest quasar in the sample of @xcite , suggesting that the nlr of cxoj1426 + 35 may plausibly extend to the observed separation of 5.5 kpc .",
    "however , an additional and important consideration involves line ratios and line strengths : in this scenario both line systems should have similar line ratios and line strengths since the ionizing continuum incident on the gas and gas densities would be the same since they would be part of the same nlr .",
    "this scenario was found to be plausible for a subset of sdss double - peaked agn with even [ oiii ] flux ratios in @xcite .",
    "however , from table [ lines ] , it is clear that the line ratios and line strengths , particularly for civ1549 and [ oiii]5007 , are not similar . unless one side of the nlr suffers more extinction than the other , and there is no reason to expect this , the different line strengths are inconsistent with both line systems originating from the same nlr .",
    "winds moving in opposite directions and ionized by a central continuum source can , in theory , produce the double - peaked profile of the narrow emission lines ( see the discussions in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "mechanisms for producing such an outflow include radiation pressure acting on gas and dust @xcite or a hot wind that entrains the nlr clouds @xcite .",
    "a potential problem with this scenario is the difficulty of the winds extending to typical nlr scales in order to affect the whole nlr .",
    "however , a smbh accreting at a relatively high eddington ratio ( @xmath115 ) may be capable of producing a wind strong enough to extend to kpc scales .",
    "in general , luminous , type 1 unobscured quasars at @xmath116 may have typical eddington ratios of @xmath117 @xcite , though recent work by @xcite suggests that @xmath118 peaks near 0.05 , or alternatively agn might instead accrete close to eddington in a ` buried ' phase as described in @xcite . in the sample of nine narrow",
    "line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) with [ oiii ] offsets in @xcite the eddington ratios are high ( @xmath119 , with the average value @xmath120 ) , and the authors remark that these high eddington ratios may capable of producing the strong outflows needed to explain the observed velocity shifts . in principle , a very rough estimate of the eddington ratio can be made using the bolometric luminosity estimated in section [ chandra ] and estimating a smbh mass assuming all of the stellar mass ( calculated in section [ sed_model ] ) is within the bulge and using the @xmath121 relation @xcite .",
    "however , the resulting mass of @xmath122 m@xmath123 , and the relation @xmath124 m@xmath125/m@xmath123 imply that the bolometric luminosity is @xmath126 times that of the eddington limit .",
    "this result seems unphysical , possibly because this galaxy is still in the process of forming and the @xmath121 relation has yet to be established in this system .",
    "however , a different test of the outflow scenario uses the optical / uv emission lines as diagnostic indicators of the ionization parameters and kinematics of the ` blue ' and ` red ' systems .",
    "we perform two calculations based upon the emission line parameters that provide clues as to the origin of the double - peaked lines .",

    "the calculated distances are highly dependent on the global covering factor , @xmath131 , of the winds as viewed from the central source .",
    "therefore , we adopt a lower limit of @xmath132 @xcite for each source , which corresponds to an upper limit on the distances . assuming a pure hydrogen nebula and complete ionization ( @xmath133 )",
    ", we estimate the distances for a typical range of nlr electron densities ( @xmath134 @xmath135 ) , where @xmath136 @xmath135 is an upper limit based on the critical density for de - excitation of [ oii]3727 , which is well - detected in the spectrum of cxoj1426 + 35 .",
    "given the range in electron densities , we find maximum distances of @xmath137 kpc and @xmath138 kpc for which the ` blue ' and ` red ' systems , respectively , can be so ionized .",
    "while these distances are consistent with the projected separation of 5.5 kpc , making the outflow scenario plausible on these grounds , it should be noted that these estimates are intended as upper limits , and that the projected separation is a lower limit on the actual physical separation .",
    "therefore , these calculations merely show that within the uncertainties of the geometry of the system , two clouds with the observed [ oii]3727/[oiii]5007 line ratios and h@xmath11 luminosities could be ionized by a single source . the limits of this argument are apparent when one considers the significantly different line ratios and line strengths between the two systems as noted in section [ nlrgeo ] .",
    "in particular , the significantly different civ1549 and [ oiii]5007 strengths are not expected if the outflowing clouds are at the same distance from the agn and have similar compositions . however , in principle , a clumpy obscuring geometry could account for this observation .    _ ionization stratification : _ the outflow scenario should produce a positive correlation between velocity offset , @xmath139 , and ionization potential , i.p .",
    ", otherwise known as an ` ionization stratification . '",
    "this is because the high ionization lines will originate closer to the central source where the flux is large enough to produce such lines , whereas low - ionization lines will originate further out where they are less affected by the outflow .",
    "such a line stratification is evident in the sample of nls1s with blueshifted [ oiii]5007 lines from @xcite .",
    "we investigate @xmath139 vs i.p . for cxoj1426 + 35 using the emission lines for which the central wavelength was allowed to vary during the fitting procedure . from a spearman rank correlation test ,",
    "we find probabilities for a correlation between @xmath139 and i.p .",
    "of 55% and 60% for the ` blue ' and ` red ' systems , respectively .",

    "this indicates there is a possibility that a line stratification might become apparent with a wider range of i.p.s .",
    "a system of two smbhs within the host galaxy , with at least one of them active , would naturally explain the two emission line systems as each smbh would provide its own nlr .",
    "since such a system would arise from a galaxy merger , one may speculate that it is more likely to be found in a disturbed system .",
    "indeed , the morphology of cxoj1426 + 35 , particularly the  lumpy \" structure evident in the nirspec image in figure [ multi ] , suggests a possible disturbance of some kind .",
    "this possibility seems even more likely when one considers that , at @xmath3 , galaxy mergers were more frequent than in the local universe ( @xcite ) .",

    "therefore , the interpretation of cxoj1426 + 35 hosting two smbhs is quite plausible and worthy of consideration .",
    "we consider two possibilities involving a galaxy merger and formation of a dual smbh system .",
    "_ one agn illuminating two nlrs : _ this scenario was also suggested for a candidate dual smbh in @xcite .",
    "it is possible that after the merger , only one of the smbhs would be active but both would have their own nlr .",

    "this is a relatively short time , and it is unlikely that we would see the system during this window .",
    "however , a more rigorous test for this scenario uses the expectation that the ionization parameter and hydrogen number densities should be consistent with one nlr being further from the ionizing source than the other . in section",
    "[ outflows ] , we estimated a range of distances based on the ionization parameters ( estimated from the [ oii]3727/[oiii]5007 ratio ) and a typical range of electron densities ( @xmath134 @xmath135 ) .",

    "however , while the measured [ oiii ] ratios are well - within the typical values for agn nlrs , we note that @xmath147 is strongly dependent on the nlr temperature , and photoionization models imply nlrs may have multiple zones with different temperatures and densities @xcite .",

    "a potential piece of evidence against this hypothesis is the nirc2-ao image which reveals only one source at rest - frame @xmath79 as opposed to the two nuclei expected in the dual agn scenario .",
    "however , there are several properties of cxoj1426 + 35 which point to a high level of internal extinction capable of obscuring an agn continuum at rest - frame @xmath79 . in particular",
    ", the high x - ray hr implies there is at least one agn suffering significant absorption , e.g. @xmath148 @xmath5 ( section [ chandra ] ) and modeling of the sed ( figure [ sed_vfv ] ) reveals that an agn with comparable absorption would be virtually invisible at rest - frame @xmath79 ( section [ sed_model ] ) .",
    "this agn would dominate in the x - ray and irac bands , while a second , less obscured agn would be associated with the source seen at @xmath79 .",

    "finally , we note that more than one of these physical mechanisms may be present .",
    "in particular , we note the possible coexistence of a galaxy merger and agn outflows .",
    "this follows from the morphology of cxoj1426 + 35 , which suggests a possible merger , and from the notion that galaxy mergers are potential instigators of enhanced smbh activity .",
    "if the merger has resulted in an agn with a relatively high eddington ratio ( e.g. , @xmath149 and perhaps close to the eddington limit ) , the accretion disk radiation pressure may be capable of producing the double - peaked narrow lines as discussed in section [ outflows ] .",
    "while an ionization stratification is not apparent given the current data , we could not rule one out for either system .",
    "this scenario is consistent with both the morphological suggestion of a recent merger while allowing for the existence of strong outflows driven by the radiation pressure of agn accretion disks .",
    "we have discussed six separate physical mechanisms that are each capable of producing double - peaked emission lines , and we have discussed the likelihood of each scenario based on the available data . we find that a superposition , even within a galaxy cluster , is highly unlikely given the small physical and velocity separation , and that the rotating accretion disk scenario is highly unlikely given the several kiloparsec separation .",
    "we find that a jet / cloud interaction is also highly unlikely simply because it is not a strong radio source .",
    "the scenario of a nlr with an disk - shaped component can naturally explain the double - peaks , but the disagreement between the line ratios and line strengths of both systems is not expected in that scenario .",
    "we find that the biconical outflow from an accretion disk can not be ruled out , and that the primary limitation is the power of the accretion disk .",
    "a recent galactic merger would potentially make the biconical outflow a more likely explanation , although there is no clear line stratification . in the case of a single agn ,",
    "the sed modeling implies there might also be a very young stellar population present which accounts for the uv excess .",
    "a merger would also increase the possibility of a single agn illuminating the nlr of each galaxy , though this scenario may not be likely given the short free - fall timescale and the similar distances of each cloud based on a single ionizing source .",
    "a more likely scenario is that there are actually two agn present .",
    "the lack of two nuclei in the nir ao image provides possible evidence against a second agn , but this may be naturally explained by the high obscuration , inferred from both the x - ray data and the sed modeling , which would obscure the continuum radiation .",
    "this scenario is also consistent with the several kiloparsec separation of the agn components , since many of the dual agns already identified have comparable separations , and it is consistent with the agn - like line ratios .",
    "based upon limited data , determining the true nature of many candidate dual and binary smbh systems has proven to be difficult given the attractiveness of alternative explanations . among the current handful of candidates there is a variety of data and interpretations , many of which have been tested and often with ambiguous results . here",
    "we use cxoj1426 + 35 , in comparison with other candidates , to review how these candidates can be tested .      given the availability of spectroscopic databases that include large samples of agn and quasars , emission line diagnostics are commonly used to select the most promising double - peaked emission line candidates for follow - up observations . from one - dimensional spectra alone ( i.e. sdss fiber spectra ) , much can be done to address the likelihood of a dual / binary agn .",
    "emission line ratios can provide information about the source of the ionizing continuum radiation @xcite , and careful examination of spectra may also reveal asymmetries , velocity - offsets , or multiple components , thereby providing valuable information about the kinematics of the nlr gas .",
    "we have performed these analyses for cxoj1426 + 35 in the above discussion , and they have been done for all of the other candidate dual / binary smbhs yet identified , providing valuable information and resulting in a variety of interpretations .",
    "for example , in j0927 + 2943 , close examination of the optical spectra ( which features two prominent emission line systems , one with just narrow lines and the other with broad and narrow lines ) has allowed for multiple models to be put forth , including a recoiling smbh @xcite , a binary smbh @xcite , a superposition @xcite and a large and small galaxy interacting near the center of a rich cluster @xcite . as another example , in j1316 + 1753 @xcite identified two nlrs and at an intermediate redshift there is a broad component to each emission line , which the authors discuss may be evidence of a starburst - driven outflow that was triggered by a merger .",
    "we also note that spectroscopic observations over multiple epochs could potentially reveal any orbital motion in a close binary smbh system .",
    "though cxoj1426 + 35 does not fall into this class as the implied separation is much too large , candidate close binary smbhs could be identified in this manner .",

    "though cxoj1426 + 35 is unresolved in our image , this is due to the off - axis detection and the resolution of the acis detector . with the hrc",
    ", the two x - ray components could potentially be resolved in cxoj1426 + 35 .",
    "we have analyzed all available data , new and archival , of the source cxoj1426 + 35 which has an intriguing spectrum showing double - peaked optical / uv emission lines .",
    "the two emission line components , separated spatially by 0.69 \" ( 5.5 kpc ) and in velocity - space by 690 km s@xmath2 , make cxoj1426 + 35 similar to other candidate dual agn , though it is unique in that it is the highest - redshift candidate dual agn yet identified .",
    "the optical / nir imaging shows an elongated and `` lumpy '' morphological structure suggestive of a disturbance , whereas the ao image shows only a single source .",
    "we have discussed several interpretations of the physical nature of cxoj1426 + 35 , including a chance superposition , a jet / cloud interaction , line emission from a rotating accretion disk , an unusual nlr geometry , a strong biconical outflow from an accretion disk , a dual smbh and a combination of these scenarios .",
    "we find that the only plausible scenarios are a strong outflow , a dual smbh system , or a combination thereof .",
    "if cxoj1426 + 35 recently underwent a merger , an increased eddington ratio may have resulted , making the disk outflow scenario a possible explanation .",
    "alternatively , a merger may have resulted in the actual case of a dual agn , or , less likely , a single agn illuminating the nlrs of both smbhs .",
    "regardless , cxoj1426 + 35 is most likely a merger remnant .    finally , we compared cxoj1426 + 35 to other candidates with the aim of reviewing methods of testing the dual agn hypothesis .",
    "analysis of single - epoch 1d and 2d spectra provides crucial information about the ionizing continuum and the velocity and spatial separation of the two emission line components , but high - resolution imaging and multi - epoch spectra have proven most effective at confirming or rejecting the dual / binary smbh hypothesis .",
    "cxoj1426 + 35 represents an interesting example of a dual agn candidate , with many properties similar to other candidates in the literature , but also with several unique characteristics .",
    "in particular , cxoj1426 + 35 is the highest redshift dual agn candidate to - date , at a redshift of @xmath3 when galaxy mergers were more frequent , making the dual agn hypothesis especially appealing .",
    "this makes it a fascinating addition and will help in developing a better understanding of how to look for the potential signatures of dual / binary smbhs and of the often complex emission line regions of agn .",
