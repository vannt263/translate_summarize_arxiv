    "gamma  ray bursts ( grbs hereafter ) are brief flashes of cosmic high energy photons . with the advent of the bepposax satellite , it has been possible for the first time to perform deep multiwavelength searches hours after the event , allowing detection in a few cases of transient emission associated with the grb .",
    "the modelling of the afterglow decay is well understood but their central engines remain enigmatic .",

    "we note that the low value of the chi - squared - reduced value is due to the fact that the errors in the data points have been overestimated . regarding the near - infrared data , a pure power - law fit with index @xmath29 ( @xmath28/dof = 0.1 ) is consistent with the first four h - band measurements , once we have excluded the host galaxy contribution ( h = 20.5 @xmath1 0.25 ) .",

    "thus , the broad - band spectrum from the near - infrared to x - rays deviates from a single power - law that should have been seen once the synchrotron break has passed the optical band .",
    "blast wave models ( sari et al . 1998 and references therein ) predict much flatter optical spectra in these bands with an optical - to - near - infrared index @xmath42 in the range @xmath410.5 to @xmath411.5 . according to the dust maps of schlegel et al .",

    "we then consider the presence of extra absorption .",
    "in fact , one possibility to straighten the observed slope is by assuming intrinsic absorption .",
    "let us determine the amount of intrinsic absorption needed in order to de - redden the spectrum to get @xmath42 @xmath3 @xmath410.6 ( and @xmath40 @xmath3 @xmath411 as expected in the cooling regime ) , close to the observed value of @xmath42 @xmath3 @xmath410.5 in grb 970508 ( derived from fig.2 of palazzi et al .",

    "( 1998b ) .",
    "this corresponds to an intrinsic column density of @xmath4 3.5 @xmath5 10@xmath6 @xmath7 .",
    "if we assume that by the time of our first observations , the peak frequency @xmath36 , has already passed the h - band , and assuming adiabatic evolution of the grb remnant , the decay of the flux after the passage of @xmath36 would go as f@xmath38 @xmath15 t@xmath44 = t@xmath27 with @xmath2 @xmath3 1.3 as observed in the r - band ( better sampled than h ) , giving @xmath45 = 2.7 , similar to grb 971214 .",
