    "rs ophiuchi , the well known recurrent nova ( rn ) , underwent its sixth recorded outburst recently on 2006 february 12 .",
    "the five previous known eruptions of the object occurred in 1898 , 1933 , 1958 , 1967 and 1985 .",
    "the binary components of the rs oph system consist of a massive white dwarf and a m8iii giant with the orbital period of the system being 460 days ( fekel et al .",
    "while the outburst of a recurrent and a classical nova share a common origin in a thermonuclear runaway on a wd surface which has accreted matter from a companion star , an important post - outburst distinguishing feature between the two is that the high velocity ejecta in a recurrent nova outburst is immediately impeded by the surrounding wind of the red giant companion .",
    "this leads to the generation of a shock wave that propagates into the red giant wind .",
    "the temporal evolution of the shock and associated physical parameters like the shock velocity have been predicted theoretically but an astrophysical environment where such predictions can be rigorously tested are extremely rare to come by .",
    "recurrent novae provide such an opportunity for testing and therefore have special significance .",
    "another class of objects where similar shock waves are open to study are young supernova remnants but here the evolution of the shock occurs on the timescale of a few hundreds of years ( vis - a - vis a few days for an analogous development to occur in a rn ) making it difficult to follow the evolution in supernova remnants .    the recent outburst of rs ophiuchi has been extensively studied at different wavelength regimes viz . in x - rays",

    "2006 ) , in the radio ( obrien et al . 2006 ) in the infrared ( evans et al . 2006 ; monnier et al . 2006 ) and in the optical ( iijima 2006 ; buil 2006 ; fujii 2006 ) .",
    "the x - ray results clearly detect a x - ray blast wave that expands into the red giant wind .",
    "the xrt observations from the swift satellite ( bode et al .",
    "2006 ) trace the temporal change in the shock velocity based on a set of 8 observations between 3.16 to 26 days after the outburst .",
    "similarly the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) observations ( sokoloski et al .",
    "2006 ) cover the shock wave evolution based on 6 epochs of observations between 3 days to 21 days after the eruption . in context of the above results , the current observations present some new aspects in addition to having the advantage of a more comprehensive temporal coverage .",
    "the major new result lies in our detection of an infrared shock wave which manifests itself through the narrowing of emission lines observed in the spectra .",
    "the detection of such a shock wave in the infrared has not been made earlier in a rn .",
    "the present data , which cover 23 epochs of observation between 1 to 47 days after outburst , also have significantly better sampling , especially in the @xmath0 first 20 days after outburst when fairly fast changes are seen in the shock evolution .",
    "additionally , the data cover a much more extended period .",
    "thus this appears to be the most comprehensive data set available for analysing the shock evolution in rs oph - like systems and for validating related theoretical models . while we make such an analysis , based on the theoretical shock model of bode @xmath1 kahn ( 1985 ) , some deviations that are seen between model and observations suggest the data set could be invaluable for testing alternative models that may be proposed subsequently or for introducing refinements / modifications in presently available ones .",
    "we also use our observations to discuss the recent result of monnier et al .",
    "( 2006 ) which rules out the origin of the near - ir emission to be from hot gas in an expanding shock .",
    "since its outburst in february 2006 , near - ir @xmath2 spectra of rs oph have been taken extensively from the 1.2 m telescope at the mt .",
    "abu observatory .",
    "an early set of spectra , taken soon after the outburst , is described in das , ashok @xmath1 banerjee ( 2006 ) . in the present work ,",
    "we concentrate on the @xmath3 band spectra with the primary aim of establishing the detection of a shock wave in the near - infrared",
    ". a more detailed analysis of other aspects of the @xmath3 band data and also the remaining @xmath4 and @xmath5 band data - involving both spectroscopy and photometry results - will be addressed in a future work .",
    "the @xmath3 band spectra presented here were obtained at a dispersion of 9.5  / pixel using a near infrared imager / spectrometer with a 256@xmath6256 hgcdte nicmos3 array .",
    "generally , a set of at least two spectra were taken with the object dithered to two different positions along the slit .",
    "the spectrum of the comparison star sao 122754 ( spectral type a0v ) , after removing the hydrogen absorption lines in its spectrum by interpolation , was used to ratio the spectra of rs oph . the object and",
    "the comparison star were always observed at similar air - mass to ensure the ratioing process reliably removes the telluric lines in the rs oph spectra .",
    "wavelength calibration was done using oh sky lines that register with the spectra and spectral reduction and analysis were done using iraf tasks .",
    "the observational details are presented in table 1 - the outburst date is assumed to be 12.83 feb 2006 ( hirosawa 2006 )",
    "the j band spectra are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the prominent lines seen are hei ( 1.0833@xmath7 m ) and paschen @xmath8 ( 1.0938@xmath7 m ) - these two lines are blended in the early spectra , oi lines at 1.1287@xmath7 m and 1.3164@xmath7 m and paschen @xmath9 at 1.2818@xmath7 m .",
    "the presence of a few weaker lines , seen later after the outburst , will be discussed in a future paper .",
    "all the emission lines strikingly show a narrowing with time - a phenomenon also seen during in the uv during the 1985 outburst ( shore et al .",
    "such a behavior implies a reduction in expansion velocity best explained by associating the line emitting matter with a decelerating shock wave .",
    "the propagation of the shock wave in rs oph - like systems , assuming a spherical geometry , has been studied earlier and can be divided into three phases ( bode @xmath1 kahn 1985 ) . in phase 1 - or the ejecta dominated stage - the ejecta expands freely into the red giant wind and produces a shock at constant velocity . in phase 2 , the shock wave is driven into the wind and the shocked material is so hot that there is negligible cooling by radiation losses - hence called the adiabatic phase . during this phase",
    "a deceleration is seen in the shock whose velocity v@xmath10 versus time t is expected to behave as v@xmath10 @xmath11 t@xmath12 assuming a r@xmath13 dependence for the decrease in density of the wind . in phase 3 ,",
    "the shocked material has cooled by radiation and here the expected dependence of the shock velocity is v@xmath10 @xmath11 t@xmath14 . to confirm whether these dependencies are indeed observed , we select the pa@xmath9 1.2818@xmath7 m and the oi 1.1287@xmath7 m lines for detailed analysis .",
    "these lines are strong yet unblended by other lines ( unlike the hei 1.0833@xmath7 m and pa@xmath8 1.0938@xmath7 m lines ) ensuring a reliable estimate of their widths .",
    "we interpret the observed line widths to be due to kinematic broadening i.e. caused by the dispersion of the line - of - sight velocity component from matter at different parts of an expanding shell ( which we assume to be spherical ) . in this case , the fwhm and fwzi ( full width at half maximum and zero intensity respectively ) are good indicators of the expansion velocity ( i.e. the shock velocity ) . in particular , half the fwzi should be a reasonably good measure of the expansion velocity since the largest blue - shifted and red - shifted velocities seen in the fwzi come from those parts of the shell that are directly approaching or receding from the observer .",
    "we present the observed line widths in table 2 . since the observed fwhm of the lines at later stages ( beyond march 20 ) is comparable to the fwhm of the instrument profile ( which is well approximated by a gaussian with fwhm = 450 km / s ; fwzi = 1350 km / s ) we have deconvolved for the instrument broadening . for this",
    ", we have used the simple , but sufficiently adequate , approximation that the square of the observed fwhm equals the sum of the squares of the instrument and true fwhm s ( and similarly so for the fwzi ) .",
    "this assumes a gaussian nature for the observed profiles which we find to be reasonably valid .",
    "the effect of the deconvolution is found to be rather small for the observations prior to 20 march which compose the bulk of the data .",
    "we have also considered whether optical depth effects could have affected the line profiles and hence their widths .",
    "this appears unlikely especially for the hydrogen recombination lines .",
    "the results of evans et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and also our h band data ( to be presented elsewhere ) show that the strength of the hydrogen lines can be approximated by case b predicted strengths indicating that they are optically thin . about the oi line we can not be certain , but",
    "its column density is expected to be several orders lower than that of hydrogen ( by virtue of a lower abundance ) and hence it is unlikely to be optically thick when the hydrogen lines are not so .",
    "we show the temporal variation of the deconvolved widths of the selected lines with time in figure 2 .",
    "+ figure 2 first establishes that there is indeed a stage of free expansion - lasting approximately 4 days - during which the shock velocity remains approximately constant .",
    "this behavior is more evident in the oi data vis - a - vis the pa@xmath9 data which suggests there may be a mild deceleration during this phase .",
    "following phase 1 , a deceleration is seen and since this slowing down occurs only after the ejecta has swept up mass from the red giant wind comparable to the ejecta mass , the onset of deceleration can be used to estimate the mass of the ejected shell . following sokoloski et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we assume the density in the binary to be 10@xmath15 @xmath16 from constraints on the mass - loss rate of the red giant ( dobrzycka @xmath1 kenyon 1994 ) and adopt a mean initial expansion velocity in the range 3500 - 4000 km / s based on our results and optical reports ( buil 2006 ; fujii 2006 ) . thus by day 4 , the swept up mass ( or equivalently the ejected shell mass ) is estimated to have a mean value of @xmath0 3x10@xmath17@xmath18@xmath19 .",
    "this value reasonably matches with the hachisu @xmath1 kato ( 2001 ) model for rs oph which estimates that an ejecta mass of @xmath0 2x10@xmath17@xmath18@xmath19 needs a mass of 1.35@xmath18@xmath19 for the white dwarf .",
    "we therefore independently infer that rs oph certainly contains a massive wd with a mass close to 1.35@xmath18@xmath19 - a similar conclusion is reached from alternative methods viz . from a lightcurve analysis ( hachisu @xmath1 kato 2001 ) and from x - ray observations",
    "( solokoski et al . 2006 ) .",
    "+ we find that the decelerative phase , for both the oi and pa@xmath9 lines is reasonably well reproduced by power law fits of the form t@xmath20 with @xmath11 varying between 0.45 to 0.79 .",
    "using a nonlinear regression technique , the best fits were determined by maximizing the correlation coefficient @xmath21 with a value of @xmath21 = 1 describing a perfect fit .",
    "the plots in figure 2 have @xmath21 values of 0.977 , 0.988 , 0.976 and 0.975 for the fwzi and fwzm of the pa@xmath9 and oi lines respectively . a mean value of @xmath11 = 0.64 ( with a standard deviation of 0.14 )",
    "can be said to characterize the data which is consistent with the swift results ( bode et al .",
    "2006 ) wherein a value of @xmath11 = 0.6 is obtained .",
    "we do note that the results in figure 2 do suggest the need of using more than one power law for different segments .",
    "however , our present aim is to obtain a simple yet reasonable assessment of the overall behavior of the line - widths and therefore we elect to use a single power law .",
    "we note that there seems to be a lack - or a very short - lived duration of phase ii ( the sedov - taylor phase ) in our data . while the reason for this is not clear , it is possible that the cooling of the ejecta begins very quickly .",
    "we find that the mean value of @xmath11 = 0.64 compares better to the expected value of 0.5 for phase iii rather than 0.33 expected in phase ii ( bode @xmath1 kahn 1985 ) .",
    "thus there are deviations in the observed data from expected model predictions .",
    "it is possible that a part of such variations arise from the assumption of spherical symmetry that is being invoked .",
    "but as the radio imaging ( obrien et al .",
    "2006 ) and interferometric results ( monnier et al .",
    "2006 ) show , the ejecta remnant has deviations from spherical symmetry and also jet - like structures .",
    "such variations in geometry are expected to affect the observed line profiles .",
    "a treatment of these effects is expected to be involved and beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "however , we find that on the whole , our results are broadly consistent with the shock model wherein a free expansion stage is expected to be seen followed by a decelerative stage characterized by a power law decay in the shock velocity .",
    "we thus believe that the observations clearly support the presence of an infrared shock wave in the recent outburst of rs oph . + while the near - ir line emission , as seen from the pa@xmath9 and oi line behavior , is associated with a moving shock , the site of its emission within the shock structure needs to be examined . the structure of the shock is understood to consist of a cool contact surface ( i.e. the region of discontinuity ) positioned between the hot compressed region consisting of the ejecta material and the hot swept - up red giant wind ( e.g. lamers @xmath1 cassinelli 1999 ) .",
    "the last two regions are the sites where the shocked gas is heated to the extremely high temperature of 10@xmath22k ( as determined for rs oph ; sokoloski et al .",
    "2006 ; bode at al .",
    "2006 ) and which is the source of the observed x - ray emission .",
    "clearly the ir line emission can not emanate from these zones because the presence of neutral oi atoms in such a hot region is not possible .",
    "thus we think that the near - ir emission originates from the contact surface , which is considerably cooler and denser , but which still propagates with the same velocity as the shock front ( lamers @xmath1 cassinelli 1999 ) thereby leading to similar kinematic behavior for the shock velocity as predicted for the x - rays ( bode @xmath1 kahn 1985 ) .",
    "monnier et al . ( 2006 ) measured the near - infrared ( h and k band ) size of rs oph during the recent outburst using interferometry to show that the object displays a near - constant size of @xmath0 3 milli - arcseconds ( mas ) over the first 60 days of the outburst . at a distance of 1.6 kpc to rs oph",
    ", the near - ir emission is expected to expand at the rate of 1 mas per day if associated with an expanding shock .",
    "since this is not seen , these authors are led to the interesting conclusion that the ir continuum does not arise from an expanding fireball - a scenario favored to explain novae outbursts . in context of this",
    ", we note that the net ir emission consists of two parts - the continuum and the line emission . regarding the line emission ,",
    "the present results clearly show that it originates from an expanding shock .",
    "this does not resolve the extent and site of origin of the near - ir continuum i.e. what part could arise from the expanding shock wave vis - a - vis the fraction that arises from other sites / mechanisms ( e.g. the alternative theory of hachisu @xmath1 kato 2001 ) .",
    "but an aspect of the monnier et al .",
    "( 2006 ) data , which maybe worthwhile to reexamine , is whether they do detect a faint signature associated with the expanding shock front .",
    "the reason to expect such a detection is that our h band spectra ( also see the evans et al . 2006 spectra ) , taken contemporaneously with monnier et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , are replete with strong brackett series lines .",
    "the combined flux contribution from these lines is estimated to be @xmath0 15 - 20 percent relative to the continuum .",
    "it would therefore appear likely that some signature of this line emission , though weaker than the continuum , should be detected and show up in expansion in the interferometric data .",
