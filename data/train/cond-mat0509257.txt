    "there can not be an effective evaporative cooling leading to a trapped quantum degenerate fermi gas ( dfg ) due to a strong repulsive pauli - blocking interaction at low temperature among spin - polarized fermions @xcite .",

    "bright solitons in a bec are formed due to an attractive nonlinear atomic interaction .",
    "as the interaction in a pure dfg at short distances is repulsive , there can not be bright solitons in a dfg .",
    "in this paper we study the possibility of the formation of stable fermionic bright solitons in a mixture of a dfg with a bec in the presence of a sufficiently attractive boson - fermion interaction which can overcome the pauli repulsion among fermions .",
    "the formation of a fermionic soliton is related to the fact that the system can lower its energy by forming high density regions ( the solitons ) when the attraction between the bosons and fermions is large enough to overcome the pauli repulsion in the dfg and any possible repulsion in the bec .",
    "in particular we consider the formation of fermionic bright solitons , which can freely move in the axial direction , in such a mixture for a quasi - one - dimensional cigar - shaped geometry using a coupled time - dependent mean - field - hydrodynamic model where the bosonic component is treated by the mean - field gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite and the fermionic component is treated by a hydrodynamic model @xcite .",

    "<S> we use a time - dependent dynamical mean - field - hydrodynamic model to study the formation of fermionic bright solitons in a trapped degenerate fermi gas mixed with a bose - einstein condensate in a quasi - one - dimensional cigar - shaped geometry . due to a strong pauli - blocking repulsion among spin - polarized fermions at short distances there can not be bright fermionic solitons in the case of repulsive boson - fermion interactions . </S>",
    "<S> however , we demonstrate that stable bright fermionic solitons can be formed for a sufficiently attractive boson - fermion interaction in a boson - fermion mixture . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the formation of fermionic solitons in the presence of a periodic axial optical - lattice potential . </S>",
    "<S> these solitons can be formed and studied in the laboratory with present technology .    </S>",
