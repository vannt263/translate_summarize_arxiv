    "there has been rapidly progress over the past three decades towards a better understanding of the accretion processes in astrophysics , in particular accretion discs around compact objects or even black holes ( see reviews by narayan , mahadevan & quataert 1998 ; kato , fukue & mineshige 2008 ) .",
    "black hole accretion is one of the most important ingredient when considering astrophysical scenarios of galaxy / quasar formation .",
    "current belief is that there are two sites where an accretion disc around a black hole can be found : in close binary systems called x - ray binaries ( xbs ) , and at the center of the galaxies .",
    "the birth of modern accretion disc theory is traditionally attributed to the original model presented by shakura & sanyev ( 1973 ) .",
    "this standard geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disc model ( ssd ) can successfully explain most of observational features in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and x - ray binaries .",
    "in the standard thin disc model , the motion of matter in the accretion disc is nearly keplerian , and the viscous heat in the disc is radiated away locally .",
    "an alternative accretion disc model , namely , the advection - dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) , was suggested for the black holes accreting at very low rates ( ichimaru 1977 , narayan & yi 1994 ) .    in some of the scenarios of structure formation in astrophysics , in particular those related to the formation of the stars or galaxies , self - gravity of the system",
    "may play a vital role .",
    "formation of an accretion disc , as one stage of the structure formation , is an important part of any theory in this field .",
    "however , in the standard accretion disc model , the effect of self - gravity in the vertical or radial direction of the disc is neglected for simplicity and the disc is supported in the vertical direction only by the thermal pressure .",
    "although in some of the accreting systems it is a reasonable assumption , there are situations , in which one can hardly neglect self - gravity of the disc itself . according to the current theories ,",
    "self - gravity of the disc not only can contribute in generating turbulence inside the disc but its force in the radial and the vertical directions would modify the angular velocity and and the vertical scale - hight , respectively duschl et al . 2000 .",
    "therefore , it is not an easy task to include self - gravity of a disc in a self - consistent approach .",
    "in fact , the theory of self - gravitating accretion discs is less developed .",
    "early numerical work of self - gravitating accretion discs began with n - body modeling ( cassen & moosman 1981 ; toomley ; cassen & stein - cameron 1991 ) .",
    "although great progress has been made in recent years in increasingly sophisticated numerical accretion disc simulations , simple analytic disc models still are the only accessible way of making direct link between the theory and observations .",
    "the theoretical treatment can estimate the spectra and other observational features of the accretion powered objects .",
    "to solve the nonlinear equations of the self - gravitating accretion discs , sometimes the technique of self - similarity is useful .",
    "some of the astrophysical systems often attain self - similar limits for a wide range of the initial conditions .",
    "moreover , the self - similar properties allows us to investigate properties of the solutions in arbitrary details , without any of the associated difficulties of numerical magneto - hydrodynamics .",
    "several classes of the self - similar solutions for the structure of self - gravitating accretion discs have been studied by now ( e.g. , paczynski 1978 ; mineshige & umemura 1996 ; shadmehri 2004 ) .",
    "some of them are presented for the standard accretion discs ( e.g. , paczynski 1978 ) , while the others are describing adafs including self - gravity ( e.g. , mineshige & umemura 1996 ; shadmehri 2004 ) .",
    "abramowicz et al .",
    "1984 examined a number of issues related disc s self - gravity in a steady state accretion disc , especially in regard to the effect of disc self - gravity on the disc topology and disc dimensions .",
    "bu , yuan & xie ( 2009 ) have proposed a self - similar solution of a magnetized adafs without self - gravity .",
    "mineshige & umemura ( 1996 ) presented a set of self - similar solutions for steady - state structure of adafs considering gravitational force of the disc in the radial direction .",
    "however , such solutions are hardly applicable because the gravitational force of the disc due to its self - gravity in adafs is generally smaller than the radial force of the central object .",
    "however , the gravitational force of the disc in the vertical direction can be a fraction of the vertical component of gravitational force of the central object , at least at the outer part of adafs .",
    "then , as we will show , the structure of the disc would modify because of the self - gravity of the disc itself .",
    "we think , our solutions are applicable to the outer parts of adafs in x - ray binaries .",
    "although we did not apply our solution to a specific astronomical system , we believe the solutions are applicable to the discs with an inner hot part surrounded by an outer cold part . in the most cases , one can hardly recognize the transition region .",
    "for example , the outer regions of the x - ray binaries are ssd , though their inner parts resemble to the hot accretion flows ( e.g. , esin et al .",
    "our solutions are suitable for a region where the disc is self - gravitating but the advection of the dissipated energy is not negligible .",
    "also , the discs of the low - luminosity agns ( e.g. , ho 2008 ) may have a similar situation and they do not show clear transition from ssd to adaf .",
    "the solutions are also applicable to slim discs , and thus have its potential applications in ulxs and nls1s ( mineshige et al .",
    "2000 ; watarai et al .",
    "the next step for future studies is to relax our simplifying assumptions , in particular similarity method , and solve the relevant equations for one of the mentioned systems and in doing so , our similarity solutions will guide us .",
    "we are interested in analyzing the dynamical behavior of a magnetized adaf when the force due to the self - gravity of the disc in the vertical direction is considered . but self - gravitational force in the radial direction is neglected because adafs do not extend radially so much .",
    "we consider only toroidal component of the magnetic field .",
    "we suppose that the gaseous disc is rotating around a compact object of mass @xmath0 .",
    "thus , for a steady axisymmetric accretion flow , i.e. @xmath1 , we can write the standard equations in the cylindrical coordinates @xmath2 .",
    "we vertically integrate the flow equations and so , all the physical variables become only functions of the radial distance @xmath3 .",
    "we also neglect the relativistic effects and newtonian gravity in radial direction is considered .",
    "the disc is supposed to be turbulent and possesses an effective turbulent viscosity @xmath4 . as for the energy conservation , we assume the generated energy due to viscosity dissipation is balanced by the radiation and advection cooling ( e.g. , narayan & yi 1994 ) .",
    "the equation of continuity gives , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the accretion velocity ( i.e. , @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 denotes the mass - lose rate per unit volume due to the wind or outflow , @xmath9 is the disc half - thickness , and @xmath10 is the surface density",
    ". we can also write @xmath11 .",
    "the equation of motion in the radial direction is @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the rotational velocity of the disc , sound and alfven velocities of the gas , respectively .",
    "sound speed and the alfven velocity are defined as @xmath15 and @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the gas and the magnetic pressures , respectively .",
    "the vertically integrated angular momentum equation becomes @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the angular velocity .",
    "also @xmath21 represents the kinematic viscosity coefficient and we assume ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a nondimensional parameter less than unity .",
    "+ the goal of this study is to investigate the effect of self - gravity of the disc on its structure .",
    "one can estimate the importance of self - gravity of the disc by comparing the contributions to the local gravitational acceleration in the vertical direction by both the central object and the disc itself .",
    "the vertical acceleration at the disc surface due to its self - gravity is @xmath24 and by the central object is @xmath25 .",
    "thus , force due to the self - gravity of the disc in vertical direction is dominated if : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mass enclose the disc within a radius @xmath3 . for",
    "adafs the typical values of @xmath28 is around 1 .",
    "since the enclosed mass @xmath27 is an increasing function of the radial distance @xmath3 , the effect of self - gravity becomes significant when the disc is thick .",
    "here we consider keplerian selfgravitating ( ksg ) disks in which selfgravity is significant only in the vertical direction and which satisfy the constraint @xmath29 .",
    "compared to the standard adaf solutions ( narayan & yi 1994 ; akizuki & fukue 2006 ) , the ksg disks require modification of the equation of hydrostatic support in the direction perpendicular to the disk . thus , while in the standard adaf solutions the local vertical pressure gradient is balanced by the z component of the gravitational force due to the central object , in the sg case we have balance between two local forces , namely the pressure force and the gravitational force due to the disk s local mass . also in the ksg case , in the radial direction centrifugal forces are still balanced by gravity from a central mass ( keplerian approximation ) .    for a self - gravitating disc , the hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction yields ( e.g. , paczyncki 1978 , duschl et al .",
    "2000 ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the pressure in the central plane @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the gravitational constant .",
    "since details of the thermodynamics in the vertical direction are not considered in our model , we shall assume the disc to be isothermal in the vertical direction .",
    "for a magnetized keplerian self - gravitating disc , we have @xmath34=c_s^{2}(1+\\beta ) \\ ] ] where @xmath35 is a vertically averaged mass density and @xmath36 , where this parameter shows the important of magnetic field pressure in comparison to the gas pressure .",
    "we will take @xmath37 as an input parameter of our model and its effect on the structure of the disc is studied for different values of @xmath37 .",
    "having equations [ eqn : p_c ] and [ eqn : c_s ] , we can write @xmath38 also , the energy equation becomes @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the ratio of specific heats .",
    "the advection parameter @xmath41 measures the degree to which the flow is advected - dominated ( narayan & yi 1994 ) , and it is supposed to be constant",
    ".    induction equation with the field scape can be written as ( akizuki & fukue 2006 ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the field scaping / creating rate due to the magnetic instability or the dynamo effect .",
    "we can rewrite this equation as @xmath44    now , we have a set of ordinary differential equations that describe the dynamical behavior of a magnetized adaf flow including self - gravity of the disc .",
    "solutions of these equations give us the dynamical behavior of the disc , which depends on the viscosity , magnetic field strength , self - gravity and advection rate of energy transport .",
    "= 3.8 in = 3.2 in    = 3.8 in = 3.2 in",
    "global behavior of the disc can not be described using similarity solutions , because boundary conditions are not considered in this method .",
    "but , as long as we are not interested in the solutions near the boundaries , similarity solutions describe correctly , true and useful asymptotically behavior of the flow in the intermediate regions .",
    "we assume that the physical quantities can be expressed as a power law of the radial distance , i.e .",
    "@xmath45 , where @xmath46 is determined by substituting the similarity solutions into the main equations and solving the resulting algebraic equations .",
    "therefore , we can write similarity solutions as @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 and the parameters @xmath52,@xmath53 and @xmath54 will be determined from the main equations .",
    "in addition , the surface density @xmath55 is assumed to be a form of @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are constants .",
    "then , in order for the self similar treatment to be valid , the mass - loss rate per unit volume and the escaping rate must have the following form , @xmath59 @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are constants .",
    "considering hydrostatic equation , we obtain the disc half - thickness @xmath9 as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the mass enclosed in the disc within a radius @xmath65 and is given approximately by @xmath66 .",
    "also , we define parameter @xmath67 as self - gravitating coefficient .    by substituting the above similarity solutions into the continuity and the motion equations and also the energy and the induction equations , we obtain the following system of dimensionless algebraic equations , @xmath68 @xmath69c_3=0,\\ ] ] @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 as is easily seen from the above equations , for @xmath74 there is no mass loss , while there exist mass loss for @xmath75 . on the other hands , the escape and creation of magnetic fields are balanced each other for @xmath76 .",
    "although outflow is one of the most important progresses in accretion theory,(see narayan & yi 1995 ; blandford & begelman 1999 ; stone & pringle & begelman 1999 and also some recent work like xie & yuan 2008 ; ohsuga & mineshige 2011 ) , but in out model we chouse self - similar solution in a way that @xmath77 and @xmath78,@xmath79 .",
    "so we ignored the effect of wind and outflow on the structure of the disks .",
    "after some algebraic manipulations , we can reduce the above equations to a sixth order algebraic equation for @xmath80 , @xmath81 where the coefficients depend on the input parameter as @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 having @xmath52 from this algebraic equation , the other variables ( i.e. @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) can be determine easily .",
    "= 3.8 in = 3.2 in    = 3.8 in = 3.3 in    = 3.8 in = 3.2 in    = 3.8 in = 3.4 in    now , we can do a parameter study considering our input parameters .",
    "figure 1 shows how the coefficients @xmath52 and @xmath53 depend on the self - gravitation parameter @xmath86 for different values of advection parameter @xmath87 .",
    "radial velocity is determined by @xmath52 which is shown in the upper panel . in adafs",
    "the radial velocity is generally less than free fall velocity on a point mass , but it becomes larger if the advection parameter @xmath87 is increased and such a behavior is consistent with the previous analytical solutions ( e.g. , akizuki & fukue 2006 ; abbassi et al .",
    "2008 , 2010 ) .",
    "obviously , larger parameter d implies a more self - gravitating disc and top plot of figure 1 shows that the accretion velocity decreases as parameter @xmath86 increases .",
    "compare to a non - self - gravitating disc , low @xmath86 , the velocity of the flow will decrease some order of magnetude . moreover , as more dissipated energy is advected within the flow , we see that the radial velocity is more sensitive to the variations of the self - gravitating parameter within the range @xmath88 .",
    "but when the disc becomes strongly self - gravitating ( i.e. , large @xmath86 ) , the accretion velocity is more or less independent of the advected energy .",
    "bottom plot of figure 1 shows coefficient @xmath53 ( i.e. , rotational velocity ) versus parameter @xmath86 .",
    "here , the rotational velocity is not affected by the variation of the parameter @xmath86 , but it decreases when the advection parameter @xmath87 increases .    in figure 2 , we assume the fraction of the advected energy is @xmath89 and then behavior of the coefficients @xmath52 and @xmath53 versus parameter @xmath86 are shown for different values of magnetic field parameter @xmath37 . for a given d ,",
    "both the radial and rotational velocities increase as the disc becomes more magnetized ( i.e. , larger @xmath37 ) a magnetized disc must rotate faster than a case without magnetic field because of the effect of magnetic tension .",
    "the radial velocity is more sensitive to the variations of @xmath86 when the disc is more magnetized .",
    "the rotational behavior is the same for different values of @xmath86 but it slightly shifts up when parameter @xmath37 increases .    in figure 3 , we show vertical thickness of the disc in terms of the self - gravitating parameter @xmath86 for different values of @xmath87 and @xmath37 .",
    "the disc becomes thinner as the parameter @xmath86 increases .",
    "if we neglect force due to the self - gravity of the disc in the vertical direction , the disc becomes thicker as more energy advected with the flow .",
    "but our analysis shows for a strongly advected disc even not very large values of @xmath86 lead to a reduction of the disc thickness by a factor of two . for a given d , by increasing the parameters @xmath87 and @xmath37 the vertical thickness increases which means that advection and magnetic field will cause",
    "the disc becomes thicker .",
    "figure 4 shows how the coefficients @xmath52 and @xmath53 depend on the advection parameter @xmath87 for different values of self - gravitating parameter @xmath86 .",
    "radial velocity is determined by @xmath52 which is shown in the upper panel . in the adafs solutions usually by adding advection parameter radial velocity will increases while the rotational velocity decrease ( akizuki & fukue 2006 ) . influence of the self - gravitation of the disc will lead to decrease of radial velocity while the rotational velocity , @xmath90 , is not affected . in figures 5 and 6 the influence of magnetic field strength , @xmath37 , on the behavior of @xmath91 and vertical thickness of the flow were plotted respectively . by adding @xmath37 , which indicates the role of magnetic field in the dynamic of accretion discs",
    ", we will see that the radial flow increase as well as rotational velocities and vertical thickness increase . on the other hand radial and toroidal velocity increase when the toroidal magnetic field becomes large .",
    "this is due to the magnetic tension term , which dominates the magnetic pressure term in the radial momentum equation that assist the radial in - fall motion .",
    "in this paper , we studied an accretion disc in the advection dominated regime considering purely toroidal magnetic field and the force due to the self - gravity of the disc in the vertical direction .",
    "a set of similarity solutions was presented for such a configuration .",
    "our solutions reduce to the previous analytical solutions ( e.g. , akizuki & fukue 2006 ; fukue 2004 ; and abbassi et al 2008 ) when self - gravity is neglected .",
    "some approximations were made in order to simplify the main equations .",
    "we assume an axially symmetric and static disc with @xmath23-prescription for the viscosity .",
    "we also ignored the relativistic effects .",
    "generally , it is believed that the adafs are hot and thick because of their inefficiency in radiating out the dissipated energy .",
    "in particular , as more energy is advected , the disc becomes thicker .",
    "but our analysis may slightly change this picture in particular regarding to the thickness of the disc if the force due to the self - gravity of the disc in the vertical direction is considered .",
    "our disc still rotates with nearly keplerian profile , but its thickness is reduced significantly because of the self - gravity . in other words , we may have a fully advected disc , but its thickness is reduced in comparison to a case without self - gravity . also , as the disc becomes more advective , the effect of self - gravity becomes more evident .",
    "we think the present solutions are suitable for the outer parts of an adaf not in inner parts .",
    "it is difficult the evaluated the precise picture of advection dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) in the presence of b - field and self - gravity with self - similar method .",
    "however , this method can reproduce overall dynamical structure of the disc whit a set of given physical parameter .",
    "although our preliminary self - similar solutions are too simplified , they clearly improve our understanding of physics of adafs around a black hole .",
    "we believe the solutions are are presented , are applicable to the discs with an inner hot part surrounded by an outer cold part where the self - gravity plays an important role and and advection of the energy is not negligible .",
    "the discs of the low - luminosity agns may have a similar situation and they do not show clear transition from ssd to adaf .",
    "the solutions are also applicable to slim discs , and thus have its potential applications in ulxs and nls1s",
    ".    it would be interesting if we add the effect of the wind and outflow in our future investigation to find out how it would change solutions .",
    "the next step for future studies is to relax our simplifying assumptions , in particular similarity method , and solve the relevant equations for one of the mentioned systems and in doing so , our similarity solutions will guide us .",
