    "at present the universe is considered a general relativistic friedmann space - time with flat spatial sections , containing more than @xmath0 dark energy and at about @xmath1 of dark matter .",
    "dark energy could be simply a cosmological constant @xmath2 , or quintessence or something entirely different .",
    "there is no widely accepted explanations for the nature of any of the dark matter or dark energy ( even the existence of the cosmological constant remains unexplained ) .",
    "an alternative to introducing dark matter would be to modify the law of gravitation , like in mond @xcite and its relativistic generalization @xcite .",
    "these theories are compatible with the large scale structure of the universe @xcite .",
    "however in spite of the successes , certain problems were signaled on smaller scales @xcite .    quite remarkably , supernova data , which in the traditional interpretation yield to the existence of dark energy , can be explained by certain f(r ) @xcite or inverse curvature gravity models @xcite .",
    "however the parameter range , in which the latter is in goood agrement with the supernova data , also presents stability problems @xcite .",
    "modifications of the gravitational interaction could also occur by enriching the space - time with extra dimensions .",
    "originally pioneered by kaluza and klein , such theories contained compact extra dimensions .",
    "the so - called brane - world models , motivated by string / m - theory , containing our observable 4-dimensional universe ( the brane ) as a hypersurface , were introduced in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , the latter model allowing for a non - compact extra dimension .",
    "the curved generalizations of the model presented in @xcite have evolved into a 5-dimensional alternative to general relativity , in which gravity has more degrees of freedom .",
    "in contrast with standard model fields , these evolve in the whole 5-dimensional bulk . in this generalized randall - sundrum type ii ( rs )",
    "theory , the brane has a tension @xmath3 and gravitational dynamics is governed by the 5-dimensional einstein equation .",
    "its projections to our observable 4-dimensional universe ( the brane ) are the twice contracted gauss equation , the codazzi equation and an effective einstein equation , the latter being obtained by employing the junction conditions across the brane @xcite . the effective einstein equation ( for the case of symmetric embedding and no other contribution to the bulk - energy - momentum than a bulk cosmological constant )",
    "was first given in a covariant form in @xcite .",
    "supplementing this by the pull - back to the brane of the bulk energy momentum tensor @xmath4 , which is @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 the bulk coupling constant and @xmath7 the induced metric on the brane ) the effective einstein equation reads @xcite : @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the brane coupling constant , related to the bulk coupling constant and the brane tension @xmath3 as @xmath10 , and @xmath11 represents a cosmological `` constant '' which possibly varies due to the normal projection of the bulk energy - momentum tensor ( this includes the contribution @xmath12 due to the bulk cosmological constant @xmath13 ) .",
    "the source term @xmath14 is quadratic in the brane energy - momentum tensor @xmath15 : @xmath16\\ , \\label{s}\\ ] ] and @xmath17 is the electric part of the bulk weyl tensor @xmath18 , given as @xmath19 in a cosmological context and suppressing any energy exchange between the brane and the bulk , this latter term generates the so - called dark radiation .",
    "otherwise it can be called a weyl fluid .    a review of many aspects related to the theories described by the effective einstein equation ( [ mode ] ) can be found in @xcite .",
    "both early cosmology @xcite and gravitational collapse @xcite-@xcite are essentially modified in these theories .",
    "there is also possible to replace dark matter with geometric effects in the interpretation of galactic rotation curves , weak lensing and galaxy cluster dynamics @xcite .",
    "the possible modifications of gravitational dynamics are even more versatile in the so - called induced gravity models .",
    "these can be regarded as brane - world models enhanced with the first quantum - correction arising from the interaction of the brane matter with bulk gravity .",
    "the induced gravity correction couples to the 5-dimensional einstein - hilbert action with the coupling constant @xmath20 .",
    "the simplest of such models , the dgp model was introduced in @xcite . this model however suffers from linear instabilities ( ghost modes in the perturbations ) , as shown for de sitter branes @xcite .",
    "the ghost modes withstand even the introduction of a second brane @xcite .",
    "generalizations of the dgp model are discussed covariantly in @xcite and @xcite when the embedding is symmetric , and in @xcite when it is asymmetric .",
    "in these models the role of the effective einstein equation ( [ mode ] ) is taken by a more complicated equation ( see for example eq .",
    "( 29 ) of @xcite ) , which contains the square of the einstein tensor @xmath21 .",
    "this implies that in certain sense the degree of nonlinearity of the theory is squared . in a cosmological setup",
    "the square root of this equation can be taken , leading to a set of modified friedmann and raychaudhuri equations , which however contain a sign ambiguity @xmath22 due to the involved square root .",
    "these are called the brane1 [ dgp(- ) ] branch for @xmath23 and brane2 [ dgp(+ ) ] for @xmath24 in the terminology of @xcite [ or @xcite , respectively ] . both the original randall - sundrum type ii model and the dgp model",
    "are contained as special subcases .",
    "notably , the brane2 branch contains cosmological models which self - accelerate at late - times .",
    "we give in fig [ fig1 ] a diagram containing a classification of these theories and how they emerge as different limits from each other .",
    "in this paper we discuss analytically the luminosity distance - redshift relation in various generalized randall - sundrum type ii brane - world models described by eq .",
    "( [ mode ] ) . our analytical approach can enhance the confrontation of these models with current and most notably , with future supernova observations .",
    "we note that recently analytical results have been given in ref .",
    "@xcite for a wide class of phantom friedmann cosmologies too , in terms of elementary and weierstrass elliptic functions .    in section 2",
    "we review the notion of luminosity distance , its relation with the redshift and how these can be measured independently .",
    "this section was included mainly for didactical purposes .    in section 3 we review the modification of this relation in the randall - sundrum type ii brane - world scenario .",
    "these include the introduction of the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 which can be traced back to the source terms @xmath14 and @xmath17 of the modified einstein equation ( [ mode ] ) .",
    "the other cosmological parameters are @xmath27 , representing ( baryonic and dark ) matter and @xmath28 .",
    "we do not include bulk sources in the analysis , with the notable exception of a bulk cosmological constant .",
    "section 4 contains the derivation of the analytic expression for the luminosity distance - redshift relation for the brane - worlds which are closest to the original randall - sundrum scenario @xcite , thus with no cosmological constant ( randall - sundrum fine - tuning ) . the generic expression ( [ solution1 ] ) of the luminosity distance derived here is given in terms of elementary functions and elliptic integrals of the first and second kind .",
    "from this most generic case we take the subsequent limits : @xmath29 ( subsection 4.2 ) , @xmath30 ( subsection 4.3 ) ; and both @xmath31 , this being the general relativistic einstein - de sitter case ( subsection 4.4 ) .    such models however could not allow for late - time acceleration , therefore in section 5 we discuss the luminosity distance - redshift relation for brane - worlds with @xmath32 .",
    "first we present in subsection 5.1 a class of models , for which the luminosity distance can be given in terms of elementary functions alone .",
    "these models are characterized by an extremely low value of the brane tension , thus are in conflict with various constraints on brane - world models .",
    "next , in subsection 5.2 we discuss brane - worlds for which the brane - characteristic contributions @xmath25 and @xmath26 represent small perturbations .",
    "this is a good assumption as observational evidences suggest that general relativity is a sufficiently accurate theory of the universe , and as such the deviations from it could not be very high , at least at late - times .",
    "we give analytical expressions in terms of both elementary functions and elliptic integrals of the first and second kind for the luminosity distance , to first order accuracy in the chosen small parameters of the model .",
    "some of the most lengthy computations needed in order to achieve the result are presented in the appendix .",
    "section 6 contains the concluding remarks .    throughout the paper @xmath33",
