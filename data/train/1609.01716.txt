    "variable point - like objects are often embedded in light of a resolved non - variable source ( active nucleus or a supernova in a galaxy ; young stellar object embedded in a nebula ) that complicate measurements of the variable object s brightness .",
    "the variations may be associated with a single catastrophic event ( supernova ) , may be approximately ( dwarf novae ) or strictly periodic ( eclipsing binaries ) or aperiodic ( active galactic nuclei ) in nature .",
    "our understanding of these events depends on the efficient and reliable detection of brightness variations .",
    "photometric measurements are prone to systematic errors that are difficult to characterize .",
    "this makes it challenging to distinguish true low - amplitude variability from the apparent one caused by systematic effects and measurement errors .",
    "imaging artefacts such as cosmetic defects of a ccd , diffraction spikes from bright objects and cosmic ray hits as well as blending between images of nearby objects can corrupt photometry and mimic high - amplitude variability .",
    "three different lines of attack on the problem of variable object detection are described in the literature : direct image comparison , ( `` transient detection '' ) , lightcurve analysis using variability indices and periodicity search .",
    "transient detection techniques seek to identify changes between two sets of sky images taken at different times ( epochs ) .",
    "the changes may be found by subtracting the images pixel - by - pixel after resampling them to a common coordinate grid and accounting for seeing changes ( difference image analysis ",

    "the second - epoch images are often taken in pairs , triplets or even longer series with dithering to eliminate image artefacts that are usually associated with a given position on the image detector , not in the sky .",
    "more sophisticated detection strategies may be applied if measurements are obtained at more than two epochs .",
    "their obvious advantage over the simple two - epoch data comparison is the potential to average - out individual measurement errors and thus detect variability with a lower amplitude .",
    "one class of methods employs various `` variability indices '' characterizing the overall scatter of measurements in a lightcurve and/or degree of correlation between consecutive flux measurements ( some recent examples : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see the detailed discussion in section  [ sec : indices ] ) .",

    "while many types of variable stars show periodic or semi - periodic light variations , flux measurement errors are expected to be aperiodic , or associated with a known periodic process inherent to the observations ( diurnal or seasonal cycle , synodic month , periodic guiding errors , orbital period of a spaceborne telescope , etc . ) .",
    "if a search is aimed at a specific variability type for which a lightcurve shape is generally known in advance ( e.g. exoplanet transits or eclipsing binaries in general , cepheids , rr  lyrae stars , novae ) , template fitting ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , , @xcite ) with various trial periods / flare development time - scales can be performed .",
    "simple cuts on lightcurve parameters as well as advanced machine learning techniques @xcite can be used to select lightcurves of a known shape from a large photometric data set . a pre - selection based on colour",
    "can be used to reduce the number of candidates when searching for variables of a specific type .    since period search and template - fitting algorithms",
    "are computationally expensive , a two - step approach can be applied .",
    "candidate variable stars are pre - selected using a fast - to - compute variability index ( and/or colour ) and only the lightcurves that passed this selection are subjected to period search or template fitting ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "selection based on period search may be followed by even more computationally intensive steps like binary system modelling @xcite . used the period along with other variability features as an input for the random forest algorithm to select periodic variable star candidates in the eros-2 database and simultaneously classify them .",
    "the methods described above may efficiently select variable object candidates from a large set of photometric data .",
    "however , the final decision to designate an object as `` variable star '' rather than a `` candidate '' is usually made only after visual inspection of the object s lightcurve by a human expert ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "if the number of observations is small , the original images are checked for the presence of obvious problems [ image artefacts , cosmic ray hits , point spread function ( psf ) wings of a bright nearby object ] affecting photometry of a candidate variable ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "variable star detection may be considered in the framework of classical hypothesis testing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : to establish that an object is variable , one needs to rule  out the null hypothesis that it is constant given the observations @xcite .",
    "one may compare a value of variability - detection statistic ( section  [ sec : indices ] ) derived from the lightcurve to the distribution of this value expected for non - variable objects .",
    "the problem is that objects with corrupted measurements produce long tails in the aforementioned distributions . in the presence of badly measured objects one",
    "is forced to set a low threshold for accepting candidate variables ( section  [ sec : cutoffvalue ] ) and rely on additional information not captured by the variability - detection statistic to distinguish true variables from badly measured objects in the distribution tail .",
    "alternatively one may view the search for variable stars as a classification problem that may be approached with machine learning techniques .",
    "the task is to classify a set of objects characterized by their lightcurves , images associated with each lightcurve point and possibly additional pieces of information associated with each brightness measurement ( object s position on the ccd frame , airmass , seeing , temperature , etc . ) .",
    "one needs to distinguish various classes of variable stars from the class of well - measured constant stars and classes of stars affected by various types of measurement errors ( bad pixels , diffraction spikes , blending ) .",
    "objects that do not belong to one of the known classes should also be identified .",
    "while considerable progress has been made in lightcurve - based automated classification of stars already known to be variable , an automated system that could reliably identify variable stars among non - variables remains to be developed .    in practice , the following approach to variable star detection is often adopted .",

    "the discussion is limited to variability indices based on lightcurve scatter ( sections  [ sec : chi2][sec : peaktopeak ] ) and correlation ( sections  [ sec : lag1autocorr][sec : sb ] ) while the period - search based techniques will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "we attempt to find a general - purpose variability detection technique able to recover a broad range of variability types including currently unknown ones @xcite .",
    "such a technique would also be useful for solving the opposite problem : reliable selection of non - variable objects that can be used as photometric standards ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or targets for searches of variations not intrinsic or not typical to the objects such as microlensing events @xcite , occultations of stars by distant solar system bodies @xcite , tidal disruption events in nuclei of non - active galaxies @xcite and failed supernovae @xcite .",

    "might be needed before @xmath15 can serve as an efficient variable star selection tool . in the following paragraphs",
    "we describe ways of characterizing lightcurve scatter that are less sensitive to outliers .",
    "the median absolute deviation , mad ( @xcite , @xcite ) , is a measure of scatter of observations @xmath4 defined as @xmath38 for a gaussian distribution @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function for the gaussian distribution .",
    "the mad statistic is mostly insensitive to outliers @xcite ; its only disadvantage is that it is equally insensitive to real variations that occur only occasionally , like rare eclipses of an algol - type binary that may show virtually constant brightness outside of the eclipses ,    the use of mad is computationally more expensive than @xmath15 as the sorting needed to compute the median is a relatively slow , @xmath41 , operation compared to calculating the average value , @xmath42 . here @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) means that there is a constant @xmath43 such that for any number of input measurements , @xmath44 , the computation will be completed in less than @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) steps . it should be noted that correlation - based indices discussed below in sections  [ sec : lag1autocorr][sec : sb ] computationally depend on the order of data points and , therefore , require the input lightcurve to be sorted in time  an operation of @xmath41 complexity .",
    "another robust measure of scatter is the interquartile range , iqr , which includes the inner 50% of measurement values ( i.e. excludes 25% of the brightest and 25% of the faintest flux measurements ) . to compute the iqr we first compute the median value that divides the set of flux measurements into upper and lower halves .",
    "the iqr is the difference between the median values computed for the upper and lower halves of the data set . for the normal distribution @xmath47 , where @xmath40 is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function for the gaussian distribution",
    "the iqr may be more appropriate than mad  ( section  [ sec : mad ] ) for measuring the width of an asymmetric ( skewed ) distribution , such as the distribution of flux measurements of an eclipsing binary .      the robust median statistic , roms , was proposed by @xcite and successfully applied for variable star search by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is defined as @xmath48 for a non - variable object , the expected value of @xmath19 is around 1 as the majority of the measurements should be within @xmath49 of the median value ( if @xmath15 is estimated correctly ) .",
    "normalized excess variance , @xmath20 , is used in x - ray and optical astronomy to characterize variability amplitude in the presence of changing measurement errors .",

    "the fractional root mean square variability amplitude , @xmath51 , another commonly used x - ray variability measure , is simply a square root of the normalized excess variance : @xmath52 @xcite if @xmath20 is positive .",
    "@xcite note that in the presence of red noise , the expected value of @xmath20 depends on the length of a time series .",
    "the value of @xmath20 estimated from a lightcurve is related to the integral of the power spectral density ( psd ) in the frequency range probed by the observations , however this relation is complex @xcite and depends on the psd slope and sampling ( window function ) .      the peak - to - peak variation , @xmath21 , can be characterized as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the maximum and minimum values of the expressions @xmath56 and @xmath57 over the entire lightcurve .",
    "this variability index , with minor variations in its definition , is widely used in the radio astronomy community .",

    "@xmath20 , section  [ sec : sigmaxs ] )    the peak - to - peak variation may be a sensitive variability indicator if we believe that a lightcurve is free from outliers ( thanks to high data quality or successful filtering ) .",
    "while @xmath21 can be computed for a lightcurve consisting of as few as two observations , the expected value of @xmath21 for a non - variable source depends strongly on the number of measurements .",
    "monte  carlo simulation is a practical way to estimate expected values of @xmath21 for a non - variable object given a number of observations and their accuracy .",
    "photometric observations are often planned so that the time span between consecutive flux measurements is smaller than the variability time - scale expected for the objects of interest . the simplest way to characterize",
    "the similarity of consecutive flux measurements is to compute the first - order autocorrelation coefficient ( also known as ` serial correlation coefficient ' or ` lag-1 autocorrelation ' ) of a lightcurve ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this simple method loses efficiency if a lightcurve is unevenly sampled since pairs of data points widely separated in time and weakly correlated or uncorrelated entirely contribute to the value of @xmath22 equally with the pairs of measurements taken close in time that may be well correlated .",

    "relying on the above assumption that a lightcurve contains pairs of measurements obtained close in time ( compared to the expected variability time - scale ) one can apply @xmath23 to a single - band lightcurve by dividing it into two subsamples that would mimic measurements in two filters .",

    "<S> it can be complemented by the ratio of the lightcurve variance to the mean square successive difference , @xmath0 , which is efficient in detecting variability on time - scales longer than the typical time interval between observations . </S>",
