    "it is widely believed that hadronic matters undergo a phase transition at high temperature , and hence become the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , where quarks and gluons are deconfined and chiral symmetry broken in the hadron phase is restored .",
    "relativistic heavy - ion collisions provide significant opportunities to explore the qgp .",
    "heavy - ion collisions are essentially nonequilibrium processes and hence the description of the time evolution is necessary to understand the phenomena in a comprehensive way .",
    "then , the hydrodynamic model is a powerful tool , and fairly correctly describes the experimental data of heavy - ion collisions , for example , transverse momentum dependence of the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "recently , our attention has been focused on dynamics near the critical points of the chiral phase transition @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the hydrodynamic model ( in particular , the so - called ideal fluid ) will be inadequate to describe nonequilibrium phenomena near the critical point . because it is valid only in the case where we are interested in gross variables associated with macroscopic time and length scales ( entropy density , energy density , etc ) and they are widely separated from other variables associated with microscopic scales(degrees of freedom of each quark and gluon ) . to understand it",
    ", we should remember the dynamical hierarchy of classical dilute gas that is shown in table [ tab:1 ] @xcite .",
    "the classical gas consists of a lot of classical particles and the dynamics is described by the liouville equation .",
    "then , the typical length and time scales are given by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , where @xmath1 is the interaction length and @xmath3 is the thermal averaged velocity .",
    "however , when we are interested in slow motions associated with the scales of the mean free path @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the liouville equation is reduced to the kinetic equation like the boltzmann equation . furthermore , when we observe quantities associated with further slower scales of the wave length and frequency of sound @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the boltzmann equation is reduced to the hydrodynamic equation . thus , in order to apply the hydrodynamic model , the microscopic scale must be smaller than the macroscopic scale , @xmath8 . as a matter of fact , we assume the local equilibrium in the hydrodynamic equation and the deviation from the local equilibrium can be characterised by @xmath9 .",
    "for example , the number density @xmath10 is approximated as @xmath11 where @xmath12 means an expectation value by an initial state and @xmath13 denotes that by a local equilibrium state .",
    "when we completely ignore the deviation from the local equilibrium , we obtain the ideal fluid .",
    "when we take into account the deviation from the local equilibrium , we obtain the dissipation term and the euler equation is replaced by the navier - stokes equation @xcite .",
    "now , we return to the discussion of the critical dynamics . in the following ,",
    "we assume that there exists a similar dynamical hierarchy even in quantum field theory because of the success of the hydrodynamic model in relativistic heavy ion collisions , although we do not have clear evidence so far @xcite . on the other hand , to apply the hydrodynamic model for describing the critical dynamics , there must exist the clear separation between the microscopic scale and the macroscopic scale , as is discussed above .",
    "however , near the critical points , the microscopic correlation length indefinitely increases and hence the expansion parameter @xmath9 is not small any more .",
    "therefore , we can not apply the hydrodynamic model to describe the critical dynamics . on the other hand ,",
    "it is probable that we still do not need the full details of the heisenberg equation of motion because of the universality of phase transition .",
    "then , from an analogy to gas dynamics , the critical dynamics can be regarded as a sort of mesoscopic scale dynamics and will be described by a kinetic equation . as a matter of fact",
    ", it is known that the critical dynamics in condensed matter physics is described by the langevin equation .",
    "this theory is called the mode coupling theory @xcite .",
    ".the dynamical hierarchy of classical dilute gas .",

    "the gross variable @xmath14 in the exact model corresponds to @xmath15 in our langevin equation .",
    "therefore , in order to derive the langevin equation without long time correlation , we must find out another variable corresponding to @xmath16 in our model and redefine the mori projection operator with the two gross variables .",
    "however , another gross variable in the njl model is not obvious because the njl hamiltonian is composed of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and does not include the composite operator @xmath19 explicitly .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we derive the correct memory function in another way .",
    "first , we assume that there exists the exact correspondence of the exact model with our equation , and speculate the correct form of the memory function . by comparison eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ex-2 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ eqn : lle ] ) , our memory function corresponds to @xmath20 , while the correct memory function should be given by the counterpart of @xmath21 . in order to obtain the correct memory function in our model ,",
    "we should separate the @xmath22 into two parts : the frequency part and the dissipation part . in quantum field theory",
    ", the frequency is given by the real part of the self energy in energy - momentum space , that is , the imaginary part of the memory function .",

    "consequently , the correlation properties of the noise are also changed .",
    "the correct noise is related not to the memory function but to the renormalized memory function by the 2nd f - d theorem . at last , we have obtained the renormalized linear langevin equation , @xmath30 where @xmath31    from the behavior of the renormalized memory function , we can see the typical time scale of the noise is given by about @xmath32 fm , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : renor ] . as is discussed above",

    "thus , the typical time scale of the microscopic variables we have coarse - grained is about @xmath32 fm . in our langevin dynamics",
    "approach , the time scale of gross variables must be larger than that of the coarse - grained variables .",
    "thus , our langevin equation is reliable when the relaxation time of @xmath15 is larger than @xmath32 fm .",
    "this condition is always satisfied near the critical points because of the critical slowing down .",
    "this langevin equation is the equation of operators , that is , the quantum langevin equation .",
    "however , in the following discussions , we solve eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rlle ] ) as a semiclassical equation with a noise as a classical random field , because the concept of the noise as an operator is not clear . for this purpose ,",
    "we introduce a classical noise that reproduces the correlation properties defined above , @xmath33 where @xmath34 means the average for the noise with a suitable stochastic weight . however , even after this replacement , the quantum effect is still included in @xmath35 , @xmath24 and @xmath36 . in this sense , this is a semiclassical langevin equation .",
    "the correlations of the noise obtained by applying renormalization is consistent with those in the generalized langevin equation for the brownian motion discussed in @xcite , where the correlation of the noise is given by the real part of the memory function rather than the memory function itself as is discussed above .",
    "otherwise , the langevin equation does not show thermalization at late time .    the averaged time evolution of the critical fluctuations of the order parameter at vanishing momentum is shown in fig .  [ fig : op ] .",
    "one can see that the nonequilibrium fluctuations relax exhibiting oscillation and finally converge to zero .",
    "this indicates that the critical dynamics of the chiral phase transition may not be described by a simple diffusion - type equation like the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) equation .",
    "the relaxation time of the critical fluctuations becomes larger as the temperature approaches toward the critical temperature because of the critical slowing down that is investigated carefully in sec .",
    "[ chap : csd ] .",
    "we have derived the linear langevin equation in the projection operator method , employing the lowest order approximation of the perturbative expansion and the renormalization of the memory function . in this section ,",
    "we show that the langevin equation converges to an equilibrium state consistent with the mean - field approximation as time goes on .",
    "the relaxation time of the critical fluctuations diverges at the critical point because of the critical slowing down .",
    "thus , the critical temperature of the second order phase transition can be determined by the temperature where @xmath37 , and hence @xmath38 , vanishes . from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : mf ] ) , the vanishing point is given by the following condition , @xmath39 this condition is nothing but the self - consistency condition of the chiral condensate calculated in the mean - field approximation @xcite .",
    "therefore , the critical temperature of second order phase transition in the linear langevin equation is completely same as the conventional mean - field result . besides",
    ", this condition can be regarded as a kind of the thouless criterion @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not clear that the critical temperature of the first order phase transition can be determined by the same condition .",
    "however , from the numerical result discussed below , one can see that the critical slowing down occurs even for the first order phase transition .",
    "next , we show that the linear langevin equation reveals thermalization . from fig . [",
    "fig : op ] , @xmath40 converges to zero at late time for arbitrary initial states .",
    "this is one evidence of thermalization .",
    "the other evidence is the correlation function of @xmath15 . from the renormalized langevin equation",

    ", we do not use the information of the initial state .",
    "however , the result is completely same as eq .",
    "( [ eqn : powers ] ) . by this means",
    ", we obtain the same expression of the correlation function in different two ways under the assumption of thermalization . furthermore",
    ", if we ignore the oscillation term , the above result reproduces the same result as the power spectrum in the brownian motion @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "our langevin equation reveals thermalization .    and",
    "this is the reason that we adapted the renormalization procedure discussed in the previous section .",
    "to get rid of the long time correlation of the memory function , it is possible to apply another condition of renormalization ; @xmath55 however , it is clear that we can not show thermalization in this renormalization condition .",
    "therefore , in order to assure thermalization , we should employ the renormalization condition discussed in the previous section .",
    "the temperature dependence of the power spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ps_0 ] .",
    "we can see that the peak moving toward origin becomes prominent as the temperature is lowered toward @xmath56 .",
    "the power spectrum characterizes the space - time correlation in the energy - momentum space and hence can be interpreted as the spectral function in thermal field theory .",
    "then the peak with narrow width reveals the existence of a collective mode whose energy tends to vanish as the temperature approaches toward @xmath56 .",
    "such a mode is called a soft mode .",
    "the soft mode appears when the system becomes unstable for external perturbations @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the power spectrum is consistent with the the previous result , where the spectral function is calculated in the linear response theory @xcite .",
    "as is well - known , the long wave length component of the order parameter shows extraordinary large fluctuations near the critical point because of the increase of the relaxation time .",
    "this slowing down of the fluctuations is called the critical slowing down @xcite . in this section",
    ", we discuss the behavior of the critical slowing down in @xmath54-@xmath57 plane .    for this purpose ,",
    "first , we calculate the phase structure of the njl model .",
    "as is discussed , the renormalized langevin equation ( [ eqn : rlle ] ) has the same critical temperature as that in the mean - field approximation .",

    "this reflects the existence of the large fluctuations around the tricritical point . at @xmath65 mev ,",
    "the order of the phase transition is first and hence the thermodynamic potential has two local minima , although it is invisible .    in order to clarify the equilibrium property above the critical temperatures , we calculated the temperature dependences of the power spectrum at @xmath66 mev in fig .",
    "[ fig : ps_280 ] . compared to fig .",
    "[ fig : ps_0 ] , one can see that above the second order phase transition , the temperature dependence of the power spectrum is almost same , although the peaks at @xmath66 mev approach to the origin faster .",
    "however , interestingly enough , the behavior of the memory function shows that the relaxation is drastically changed around the tricritical point as we will see soon later .",
    "we are interested in the behavior near the critical points and the typical time scale of the critical fluctuations increases because of the critical slowing down .",
    "then , we can ignore the microscopic time - dependence included in the memory function and the frequency function . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : renor ] , the renormalized memory function converges to zero with a short time scale about 1 fm , that is negligible by comparison with the time scale of the critical fluctuations in the vicinity of the critical temperature .",

    "[ fig : fre ] at a vanishing momentum . above the critical line of the second order phase transition",
    ", the frequency decreases at the almost same speed as the temperature approaches to the critical temperature for different @xmath57 . on the other hand , above the critical line of the first order phase transition , the frequency increases with @xmath57 along the critical line from the tricritical point .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the behavior of the thermodynamic potential . above the second order phase transition ,",
    "the thermodynamic potential has only one minimum and the curvature of the potential is negligibly small as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ep ] .",
    "however , the thermodynamic potential has two minima above the first order phase transition and the curvature of the potential can be finite .",
    "the behavior of the relaxation is extremely interesting in comparison with that of the frequency .",
    "the temperature and chemical potential dependences of the relaxation time is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lt ] .",
    "the relaxation time at lower temperature than 50 mev is not shown because it diverges at speed .",
    "thus , we plotted the damping coefficient @xmath78 in low temperature and large chemical potential region in fig .",
    "[ fig : damp ] instead of the relaxation time . at a fixed @xmath57 ,",
    "the relaxation time increases as the temperature is lowered toward the critical temperature and diverges at the critical point because of the critical slowing down . in this figure",
    ", we started to plot from the 1 mev higher temperature than the critical temperature .",
    "when we increase @xmath57 along the critical line , we encounter the enhancement of the critical slowing down ; one is in the low temperature and large chemical potential region and the other is around the tricritical point .",
    "the former can be explained by the pauli blocking due to the fermi surface . as a matter of fact , the damping coefficient vanishes quickly there as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : damp ] .",
    "more interestingly , the critical slowing down can be enhanced around the tricritical point .",
    "this would be related to the broadness of the bottom of the thermodynamic potential . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ep ] , when we increase the chemical potential , the bottom of the thermodynamic potential increases gradually and achieves maximum at the tricritical point . at larger chemical potential than that of the tricritical point ,",
    "the thermodynamic potential has two minimum but the potential barrier between the two minima is still shallow .",
    "thus , the large fluctuations are still possible to survive . in short , there exist extraordinary large fluctuations around the tricritical point and this causes the enhancement . because of the large relaxation time of the critical fluctuations , thermalization is decelerated , in particular , in the low temperature and large chemical potential region and around the tricritical point .",
    "it should be noted that the enhancement is not obvious in the behavior of the power spectrum .",
    "this is because the power spectrum is given by @xmath48 and @xmath47 , and the former is smaller than the latter .",
    "thus , the behavior of the power spectrum is dominated by @xmath47 and the information of @xmath48 is smeared . however , as is indirectly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fre ] , the frequency @xmath47 does not reveal the anomalous behavior around the tricritical point , clearly .",
    "thus , we can not see the remarkable difference between figs .",
    "[ fig : ps_0 ] and [ fig : ps_280 ] .",
    "we have derived the linear langevin equation that describes the dynamics of the chiral phase transition at finite temperature and density .",
    "the simple application of the projection operator method to the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model caused the long time correlation in the memory function . to avoid this difficulty",
    ", we introduced the renormalization of the memory function .",
    "the resulting langevin equation reveals the critical slowing down at the same temperature as that estimated in the mean - field approximation and shows thermalization .",
    "the order parameter relaxes exhibiting oscillation and this is different from the behavior expected from a simple diffusion - type equation like the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) equation .",
    "this means that the assumption employed to derive the tdgl equation may lose its validity in the chiral phase transition . in the derivation of the tdgl equation",
    ", one assumes that the time evolution of the order parameter is induced by a sort of the thermodynamic force that is given by @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the ginzburg - landau free energy and @xmath81 is the order parameter .",
    "however , in general , a number of thermodynamic forces are possible to induce such an irreversible process because of the cross effect ( for example , the dufour effect and the serot effect in thermal conduction ) .",
    "then , the usual tdgl equation can be changed from a simple diffusion - type equation .",
    "the power spectrum was also calculated in different two ways .",
    "one is the application of the wiener - khinchin theorem and the other is to solve the evolution equation of the correlation function under the assumption of initial thermal equilibrium .",
    "the two power spectrums have completely same form and we can conclude that the langevin equation shows thermalization .",
    "the energy and temperature dependences of the power spectrum is consistent with that calculated in the linear response theory where the random phase approximation is employed @xcite and there exists the soft mode . as a result , we can conclude that our langevin equation fulfils the requirements near @xmath82 .",
    "in this calculation , we approximate the memory function calculating the ring diagram contribution because we want to derive the equation that converges to the equilibrium state consistent with the mean - field approximation .",
    "however , it is possible to derive the equation including higher order contributions .",
    "then , the merit of our formulation is to be possible to derive * nonperturbative * results by approximating the memory function * perturbatively * , and the higher order term is already known by the systematic expansion of @xmath83 .    in the latter part of this paper , we discussed the temperature and chemical potential dependences of the critical fluctuations in the chiral phase transition . at a fixed @xmath57 , the relaxation time of the critical fluctuations increases because of the critical slowing down .",
    "on the other hand , increasing the chemical potential along the critical line , we found the enhancement of the critical slowing down .",
    "one is seen in low temperature and large chemical potential region .",
    "this is because the decay of the critical fluctuations is suppressed owing to the pauli blocking .",
    "the other enhancement is shown around the tricritical point .",
    "this would be related to the broadness of the thermodynamic potential around the tricritical point and means that there exist extremely large fluctuations .",
    "the enhancement of the critical slowing down may affect the formation of the disoriented chiral condensate ( dcc ) . around the tricritical point",
    ", the large fluctuations can have a long relaxation time and it may be of advantage to form the large domain of dcc .    as is well - known , the mean - field approximation can not describe the static and dynamical critical exponents correctly in various cases .",
    "thus , the validity of our results might be suspected .",
    "however , it should be noted that we approximate the memory function by the ring diagram contribution and hence the relaxation dynamics itself includes the fluctuation effects , although the equilibrium state is consistent with the mean - field one .    as another problem",
    ", we used the njl model as a low - energy effective theory of qcd , where the endpoint is located at lower temperature and higher chemical potential than those estimated in other approaches , for example , lattice qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "however , we can expect that our calculation is still available to describe the critical dynamics qualitatively , because the enhancement of the critical slowing down can be explained from the pauli blocking and the behavior of the thermodynamic potential .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to expect that the behavior still survive even if we take into account higher order corrections or calculate in more realistic models .    in this study",
    ", we ignored the finite current quark mass .",
    "when we take into account it , the phase transition is changed from the second order to crossover and the tricritical point is replaced by the endpoint .",
    "then , the critical slowing down is smeared and hence the behavior around the endpoint will be changed .",
    "we have discussed the derivation and the behavior of the langevin equation ignoring nonlinear effects . however , from the ginzburg criterion , the nonlinear fluctuations play important roles near the critical points . as a matter of fact , the mode coupling theory makes it clear that to calculate the dynamical critical exponent correctly , we must introduce nonlinear terms in the van hove theory @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear term will affect not only the dynamical critical exponent but also the power spectrum .",
    "the behavior of the power spectrum discussed in this paper was almost same as that in the linear response theory .",
    "this means that the conventional discussions based on the linear response theory may be inadequate to discuss the behaviors of the critical fluctuations .",
