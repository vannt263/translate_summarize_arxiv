    "magnetic reconnection in collisionless relativistic electron - position ( pair ) plasma plays an essential role in a number of important astrophysical problems , such as relativistic jets from supermassive black holes , relativistic winds from pulsars and possibly outflows from gamma - ray bursts . in the crab pulsar wind ,",
    "relativistic reconnection in pair plasmas has been considered as a primary mechanism to convert magnetic energy to particle energy .",
    "@xcite although magnetic reconnection has been extensively studied , the physics of fast reconnection and particle energization in 3d relativistic reconnection is still a mystery .",
    "magnetic reconnection of pair plasmas provides a unique opportunity to examine critically the fundamental reconnection physics due to the absence of hall term , @xcite which is generally thought to be the main mechanism for fast reconnection in electron - ion plasmas . understanding of relativistic magnetic reconnection of pair plasmas will also provide useful physical insights for both new laboratory experiments of pair plasmas @xcite and observations of the high energy universe .",
    "previous reconnection studies of relativistic pair plasmas have focused on the fast reconnection and particle acceleration mostly in 2d @xcite or reconnection onset in 3d with relatively small system size .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that instabilities in a cross - field plane such as the kelvin - helmholtz instability ( khi ) @xcite and the drift kink instability ( dki ) @xcite are of critical importance to understanding magnetic energy dissipation .",
    "@xcite the past studies used small - scale particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations , ( e.g. , the length in the outflow direction is @xmath0 inertial lengths ) , however , the characteristic system size in most astrophysical / laboratory systems is vastly larger . thus , it is important to study these processes in a truly 3d configuration .",
    "fast reconnection in the relativistic limit in 2d has been reported to be mostly facilitated by pair pressure tensors .",
    "@xcite @xcite performed the largest 3d pic simulations to date of non - relativistic pair plasma reconnection and found that elongated current sheet is unstable to secondary kink instability and leads to the bending of the current sheet . for particle acceleration , past 2d simulations of reconnection mostly started from an initially externally imposed reconnection electrical field and showed that particles are primarily accelerated near the x lines by electrical fields .",
    "@xcite however , electrical fields within a small fraction of the total volume at x lines are difficult to account for the large number of accelerated electrons of the total volume .",
    "@xcite recently @xcite reported some surprising satellite observation evidences that energetic electron flux peaks at sites of compressed density within islands during electon - ion reconnection in the earth s magnetosphere .",
    "@xcite reported that for relativistic pair plasmas in 2d without a guide field , most of particle acceleration happens inside magnetic islands possibly like a betatron ( but no details are provided ) ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the well accepted particle acceleration mechanism needs to be revisited , especially in 3d .",
    "@xcite suggests that fermi acceleration from contracting magnetic islands is the major mechanism for acceleration in 3d non - relativistic electron - ion plasma magnetic reconnection and electrons are mostly accelerated within the islands . in this paper",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "the geometry of the simulation is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo ] .",
    "the simulations are initialized with a relativistic harris equilibrium current sheet .",
    "@xcite the initial magnetic field has @xmath1 and @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 is the half thickness of the current sheet .",
    "the initial plasmas consist of two distinct parts : @xmath4+\\underline{\\frac{n_{\\rm b}}{4\\pi m_s^2ct_bk_2(m_sc^2/t_b)}\\exp(-\\frac{\\epsilon}{t_b})}\\,,\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath5 denotes positron ( @xmath6 ) and electron @xmath7 , respectively .",

    "the second part of plasmas ( for both electrons and positrons ) has the same temperature @xmath16 as the background plasma but their density is given as @xmath17 .",
    "electrons and positrons are drifting against each other , with electrons having @xmath18 and positrons having @xmath19 .",
    "the drift velocity @xmath20 is given as @xmath21 .",
    "both species have relativistic maxwellian distributions .",
    "the initial current from the drifting distributions is in the @xmath9 direction .",
    "the simulation parameters are @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the positron inertial length , plasma frequency and cyclotron frequency , respectively .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used in @xmath27 and @xmath9 with reflecting boundaries in @xmath28 .    in such anti - parallel geometry ,",
    "the linear vlasov theory predicts two types of instabilities : tearing , with wave vectors along @xmath27 , and kink , along @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite using the parameters given above , linear theory predicts that the fastest growing tearing mode has wave number @xmath29 and growth rate @xmath30 , while the fastest growing kink mode has @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we have also performed 2d relativistic nonlinear tearing simulation ( one cell in @xmath9 direction ) and 2d relativistic nonlinear kink simulation ( one cell in @xmath27 direction ) .",
    "we find that the fastest tearing mode has @xmath29 and @xmath33 , and the fastest kink mode has @xmath31 and @xmath34 .",
    "they match the linear vlasov theory very well .",
    "@xcite also carried out similar linear vlasov analysis in the relativistic limit ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "compared to the results in the non - relativistic regime , @xcite the growth rates of both modes are greatly reduced and the wavelengths of both modes are increased by the relativistic effects , which is further verified in the 3d simulations . while in the non - relativistic regime the growth rate of the fastest growing kink mode is almost twice as large as that of the fastest growing tearing mode , the growth rate of the fastest tearing modes in the relativistic regime is a bit larger than the fastest growing kink modes , which results in the earlier emergence of tearing modes than kink modes in 3d simulations , contrary to that in the non - relativistic regime .    in 3d , to examine how the reconnection dynamics may be influenced by both the linear and nonlinear competition between the tearing instability ( in @xmath28-@xmath27 plane ) and the kink instability ( in @xmath28-@xmath9 plane ) , we use four simulations with the same size in the tearing plane @xmath35 but different sizes in the @xmath9 direction so that different spectra of kink modes can be excited .",

    ", @xmath53 is the debye length , and the time step @xmath54 is @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath55 , and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "the total energy is conserved to better than @xmath58 throughout the simulation runs . in order to remove the recirculation issue , all data presented here are chosen before recirculation happens ( @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the typical particle group velocity in @xmath27-direction ) .",
    "we now discuss the dynamics of the evolution .    fig .",
    "[ fig : total ] shows the time evolution of total magnetic energy of the four simulations .",
    "we have divided the magnetic energy conversion evolution into two main stages ( separated by the dash line in fig .  [",
    "fig : total ] ) . for the first stage ( tearing stage thereafter ) when @xmath61 , the dynamics is dominated by the development of relativistic tearing instability as indicated by the red and green curves .",
    "the linear kink instability plays essentially little role for energy conversion in run a and b. it becomes visible in run c and d but it seems subdominant to the tearing modes ( it has smaller growth rate compared to the tearing mode ) .",
    "the purely linear growth stage lasts until @xmath62 , then the islands from tearing start to merge , entering the nonlinear stage .",
    "the time @xmath63 marks the eventual saturation of the tearing nonlinear evolution . for the second stage ( secondary kink stage thereafter )",
    "when @xmath64 , a new nonlinear instability becomes active .",
    "this was referred to as the secondary kink instability in an earlier , similar study using non - relativistic pair plasmas .",
    "@xcite this happens in 3d only when there is sufficient length in the z - direction , as indicated by run c and d ( black and blue curves ) .",
    "we can see that the tearing instability converts about 27% of the initial magnetic energy into particle energy , followed by the additional conversion from @xmath65 to @xmath66 of the initial magnetic energy by the secondary kink for run c and d. this result indicates that the overall energy conversion depends on how many modes are allowed in the z - direction and their nonlinear interactions with the tearing instability .",
    "the relativistic cases presented here show a number of similarities to the previous non - relativistic 3d cases studied in @xcite . during the linear phase @xmath67 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tearkink1 ] ) , about @xmath68 small magnetic islands form along the @xmath69 plane from the tearing instability .",
    "contrary to the non - relativistic limit , @xcite the primary kink mode with wavelength @xmath70 appears a little bit later than the tearing mode , undulating the small magnetic islands in the @xmath9 direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tearkink1 ] ) . then the magnetic islands formed from the tearing instability coalesce to produce a dominant reconnection site through which most of the magnetic flux is processed ( @xmath61 ) ( fig .  [ fig : tearkink2 ] ) . when magnetic islands are formed ,",
    "the islands are not observed to be contracting , but rather they are either expanding or merging or remaining in a quasi - steady state . for run",
    "d , we see that , in the linear phase , both the tearing and kink instabilities are growing , causing the the reconnection sites to be `` patchy '' [ fig .",
    "[ fig : tearkink2 ] ( c ) ] .",
    "after the major reconnection site is established ( @xmath64 ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tearkink3 ] ) , this dominant diffusion region expands in @xmath27 to form a highly elongated current sheet unstable to secondary kink instability if the dimension in the current direction ( @xmath9 ) is large enough .",
    "note that the wavelength @xmath71 of the secondary kink mode is larger than the wavelength of the linear kink mode , thus there is no secondary kink modes in run b @xmath72 ) .",
    "the current sheet is bent by secondary kink instability and form plasmoids . in the case of @xmath73 ( run b ) ,",
    "the elongated current sheet is also unstable to the secondary tearing instability , small secondary magnetic islands appear , expand and merge with the large primary magnetic islands . in all cases this major reconnection site becomes quite extended in the @xmath9 direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tearkink3 ] ) .",
    "an analysis of the generalized ohm s law reveals that the reconnection electrical field is mostly from pair pressure tensors at the reconnection sites ( fig .",
    "[ force ] ) , consistent with previous results.@xcite the dimensionless reconnection rate @xmath74 ( @xmath75 represents an average over the inflow surface , vertical electrical field component @xmath76 and magnetic field @xmath77 are measured at the inflow surface ) after the establishment of the major reconnection site remains fast and time dependent , with @xmath78 and @xmath79 for run b and c , respectively .",
    "these rates are smaller than the value in the non - relativistic regime .",
    "@xcite the reduction of reconnection rate might be due to the higher effective inertia in the relativistic case .",
    "@xcite the inflow surface is chosen to be @xmath80 upstream from the dominant reconnection site and has an extent of @xmath81 in @xmath27 .",
    "the time - dependent nature of the reconnection rate is due to both the formation and destruction of the plasmoids ( similar to the non - relativistic case ) .",
    "we now describe the particle energization processes .",
    "given the fact that the 2d run gives a similar amount of total energy conversion as 3d runs during the tearing stage , we first discuss the magnetic dissipation process associated mostly with the tearing instability in the @xmath82 plane and assume that the variation along the z direction does not play a major role . during the second stage ,",
    "for 3d runs with sufficient length in the @xmath9 direction , the variation along the z direction plays an important role in particle energization ( see  [ sec : kink ] below ) .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] shows the particle energy distributions at different times based on two runs , a ( panels _ a , b , _ and _ d _ ) and c ( panel _ c _ ) .",
    "panels _ a _ and _ c _ represent the particle distribution from the whole computational domain of run a and c. panels _ b _ and _ d _ represent the particle distribution taken from a sampling box with @xmath83 at the magnetic island ( _ b _ ) and the reconnection site ( _ d _ ) of run a. the four curves in each panel represent four characteristic stages of the evolution : the initial state , the end of linear phase , the end of nonlinear interaction stage , and during the secondary kink ( for run c ) , respectively . note that , for panels _ b _ and _ d _ , the total number of particles within the sampling box is changing with time .",
    "we have normalized the distributions at different times so that the curves have the same number of particles within each panel .",
    "the initial particle distributions [ the black curves in panel ( _ a , c _ ) ] are composed of two parts : one part from the background plasmas and the other from the current sheet plasmas , which has a higher effective temperature because of the drift . on the other hand , the black curves in panel ( _ b , d _ )",
    "are mostly composed of the current sheet plasmas only . over all , a major part of energy conversion takes place between the end of the linear phase and the establishment of the major reconnection site ( between _ blue _ and _ green _ lines in panels _ a _ and _ c _ ) , consistent with fig .",
    "[ fig : total ] .    inspecting panel _",
    "d _ , we find that there is some amount of particle acceleration at the reconnection site , as indicated by the _",
    "blue _ curve .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the reconnection electric field is the largest at these locations .",
    "but such acceleration , although having large local electric fields , is very limited spatially and does not last in time since the particles can not stay at the reconnection site for a long time but rather quickly leave the reconnection sites via outflows and enter the magnetic islands , as indicated by the _ green _ and _ red _ curves when the particle energy distribution becomes less energetic than the initial distribution .",
    "eventually the plasmas at the reconnection sites are replaced by the edge plasmas from inflow , from the black line with nonzero @xmath84 to the red line with zero @xmath84 .",
    "( note that for a given drifting relativistic maxwellian distribution , the absolute value of the slope is proportional to @xmath85 using the log - linear scale , where @xmath84 is the drift velocity . )",
    "panel _ b _ , however , reveals that a large amount of energy conversion occurs in the magnetic island region .",
    "even though the electric field in these island regions might not be as high when compared to the peak reconnection electric field , both the volume and number of particles that experience these electric fields are much larger .",
    "the particles are confined inside the magnetic islands for a much longer time than at the reconnection site .",
    "furthermore , by analyzing particle distribution changes within much smaller time spans ( see below ) , we find that the energetic particle population in the island regions must be produced _ in - situ _ ,",
    "i.e. , the majority of the energetic particles do not get energized in the reconnection region then propagate to the island regions .",
    "note that plasmas inside the islands seem to be eventually thermalized into another relativistic maxwellian distribution with a temperature roughly @xmath86 times the initial temperature of the background plasmas [ the green and red lines of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ( _ a , b _ ) ] .",
    "although particle acceleration is expected at the reconnection sites , it is not so obvious why the majority of particle energization occurs in the island regions in these simulations . during the tearing stage , outflows from reconnection ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : geo ] ) lead to strong and @xmath27-dependent @xmath87 at the edges of islands ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : geo ] ) , where @xmath88 is mostly along the y - direction and @xmath89 is in the @xmath82 plane .",
    "the resulting electric field component @xmath76 is quite significant because the outflow velocity can become quasi - relativistic .",
    "this is a peculiarity of the relativistic pair plasmas because of the absence of ions , which are much heavier than the electrons .",
    "therefore the alfven velocity ( the typical outflow speed for particles ) can become relativistic too , leading to a large component of @xmath90.@xcite we find that these electric fields tend to be long - lived and are distributed over large spatial volumes .",
    "consequently they are responsible for the majority of magnetic energy conversion to particles , at least for the configurations we have studied here .    to understand the details of particle energization , we plot the spatial distribution of the normalized @xmath91 in fig . [",
    "fig : acceleration ] , using results from run a. the reconnection regions indeed have @xmath92 , indicating the existence of a net electric field that can accelerate particles .",
    "most other regions have @xmath93 , which has been usually interpreted as not useful for particle acceleration because there exists a lorentz transformation that makes electric field vanish .",
    "@xcite such consideration , however , does not apply when there are large spatial variations of @xmath76 or @xmath94 or both . in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : acceleration ] , we plot the @xmath94 and @xmath76 profiles along the @xmath27-axis ( with @xmath95 ) . as particles try to gyrate in the @xmath96 plane due to @xmath94 but experience a spatially varying @xmath76 along the @xmath27-direction within their gyro - orbits , net acceleration can occur .",
    "particular types of field structures are favored in particle acceleration as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : acceleration2 ] .",
    "panel ( a ) emphasizes the spatial variations in @xmath76 .",
    "particles gain more energy in the larger @xmath97 side than the energy lost in the smaller @xmath97 side .",
    "another scenario emphasizes the variations in @xmath94 .",
    "particles have larger gyroradius in the smaller @xmath98 side than in the larger @xmath98 side , leading to net particle acceleration in the @xmath9 direction.@xcite fig .",
    "[ fig : acceleration ] ( _ bottom _ ) shows that both of these structures are present when the tearing instability becomes nonlinear . to confirm this acceleration process , we have performed test particle calculations using the initial particle distribution as in the simulation @xcite and with three different field structures : 1 ) constant @xmath94 but spatially varying @xmath76 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : acceleration2 ] ( _ a _ ) ] ; 2 ) constant @xmath76 but spatially varying @xmath94 ; 3 ) temporally and spatially varying @xmath94 and @xmath76 directly from the 2d simulation run a [ fig.[fig : acceleration2 ] ( _ b _ ) ] .",
    "the @xmath76 and @xmath99 profile data from the nonlinear simulation are fitted with first order polynomials by the least square fit method at @xmath100 between @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "and then a spatially constant @xmath103 and a realistic @xmath99 profile are used for ( 1 ) and a spatially constant @xmath104 and a realistic @xmath76 profile are used for ( 2).the total number of particles used in these test particle calculations is around @xmath105 .",
    "we find that the varied @xmath76 scheme [ fig .",
    "[ fig : acceleration2 ] ( a ) ] produces @xmath106 times more efficient particle acceleration than the varied @xmath94 scheme .",
    "quantitatively , for efficient acceleration , it is necessary for the typical @xmath76 variation scale to be smaller than the particle s gyroradius : @xmath107 is the characteristic @xmath76 along the particle trajectories .",
    "this suggests that the more sharply varied @xmath76 or weaker @xmath94 leads to more efficient particle acceleration , which is confirmed by our test particle calculations [ fig .",
    "[ fig : acceleration2 ] ( _ c _ ) ] .",
    "furthermore , test particle calculation using the time - dependent field output from the simulation run a gives @xmath108 by statistical average [ fig .",
    "[ fig : acceleration2 ] ( _ d _ ) ] , which is sufficient to explain the particle energy gain before the secondary kink instability kicks in .",
    "we confirm that particles are mostly accelerated at the edges of the islands ( e.g. , the region around @xmath109 and @xmath110 , also see fig .",
    "[ fig : geo ] ) .",
    "this type of field configuration is quite robust and is found to persist throughout the whole tearing stage .",
    "the long - term ( @xmath111 ) test particle calculations result in quasi - maxwellian distributions at low energy , but with significant @xmath112 non - thermal high - energy particles ( @xmath113 ) at @xmath114 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : acceleration2 ] ( _ d _ ) ] , which is not observed in the real simulations .",
    "this is most likely due to the thermalization process in real simulations ( see below ) .",
    "the test particle study shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : acceleration2 ] suggests that the fields from the tearing instability could accelerate particles to high energies ( @xmath115 ) .",

    "the particle distributions are taken from a sampling box at @xmath116 and @xmath117 , which is near the right edge of the central island shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : acceleration ] .",
    "specifically , as electrons are accelerated in the @xmath118 direction ( panel _ b _ of fig .",
    "[ fig : thermalization ] ) , their @xmath118 momentum turns into @xmath119 momentum due to the relatively large @xmath94 , e.g. , the extended tails in @xmath120 shown as unsymmetric black dash line in panel _",
    "a_. note that the positrons will experience similar processes , except that they have @xmath121 turning into @xmath120 .",
    "subsequent evolution shows that there exists a series of plateaus with decaying magnitudes at the @xmath120 side of particle number distribution [ blue and green lines of fig .",
    "[ fig : thermalization ] ( _ a _ ) ] .",
    "the particle distribution then turns into an approximately symmetric maxiwellian distribution in @xmath122 as shown by the red line of fig .",
    "[ fig : thermalization ] ( _ a _ ) .",
    "this distribution can be fitted with two temperatures , suggesting that the energy gained through the @xmath76 acceleration has been thermalized in the @xmath122 direction .",
    "note that the time difference between the black dash and red curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : thermalization ] ( _ a _ ) is @xmath123 , this implies that the thermalization process is quite efficient .",
    "we suggest that a mixture of bump - on - tail and two - stream instabilities can cause wave excitation and landau damping , and this eventually results in a symmetric distribution in @xmath122",
    ". this process could be fast because the strength of two - stream instability and landau - damping is proportional to plasma frequency @xmath124 in pair plasmas , much larger than in electron - ion plasmas ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "the above particle thermalization process would happen repeatedly inside the islands and eventually all the plasmas inside the islands are thermalized into a higher temperature . from fig .",
    "[ fig : thermalization ] ( _ a _ ) , the typical thermalization time scale is found to be @xmath126 .",
    "it is worth noting that during the time window shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thermalization ] , no island merging is observed to take place .",
    "furthermore , similar particle distribution evolution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thermalization ] appears also at both downstream ( @xmath127 ) and upstream @xmath128 regions simultaneously around @xmath129 region .",
    "this rules out the possibility that this energization is due to the particle convection , but supports the suggestion that the thermalization is due to local  micro - instabilities \" .",
    "in addition , we observe that particles are drifting slowly in the @xmath27 direction , with a typical _ particle _ velocity @xmath130 ( not _ phase _ velocity ) .",
    "this means that the particles travel @xmath131 in @xmath132 in the @xmath27-direction , which is much smaller than the size of the magnetic islands ( @xmath133 ) , thus particles do not have enough time to bounce between the edges of the islands .",
    "the typical gyro - radii of the particles are always @xmath134 times smaller than the island size at every stage , thus the particle acceleration from bouncing between  walls \" of contracting magnetic islands @xcite due to the fast gyro - motion is not possible either .",
    "we also find that particles have very small @xmath135 throughout the evolution and the @xmath136 distribution remains `` skewed '' due to the presence of @xmath76 until quite late time ( @xmath137 ) when the distribution in @xmath136 becomes symmetric as well [ fig .",
    "[ fig : thermalization ] ( _ b _ ) ] .",
    "even though we mostly present the results from run a , we found similar results with run c. both the acceleration mechanism that relies on the spatial variation of @xmath76 and the subsequent thermalization process seem to be robust processes for particle energization in pair plasmas .",
    "for both run c and d , there is additional particle energization in the secondary kink stage .",
    "we find that current sheets along the @xmath9 direction emanating from both the reconnection and island regions undergo the secondary kink instability with similar wavelength @xmath71 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : second_kink ] ) .",
    "the magnitude of kinking at the island region is larger because the kinking at the reconnection site is suppressed by the reconnection inflow ( fig .",
    "[ fig : second_kink ] ) .",
    "the onset of the secondary kink instability inside the island is also delayed compared to the one at the reconnection site since the the current sheet at the magnetic islands is thicker .",
    "those secondary kink instabilities are new kink modes since the the initial primary kink modes have been stabilized during the tearing stage .",
    "the appearance of the @xmath9-dependent @xmath99 and @xmath76 resulting from the secondary kink instability ( fig .  [",
    "fig : second_kink ] ) looks very similar to fig .  1 of @xcite , which suggests that the same particle acceleration mechanism works for the secondary kink instability during this stage , _ i.e. _ , a  dc \" acceleration channel mechanism ( for detailed discussion please see @xcite ) .",
    "this same mechanism accelerates high - energy particles ( @xmath138 ) efficiently at both magnetic islands and reconnection sites .",
    "this leads to the production of the non - thermal particles [ high energy tail of _ red _ line of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ( _ c _ ) ] , although those non - thermal particles would be mostly thermalized by the above thermalization process associated with @xmath94 and only some of non - thermal particles might be left . here",
    "@xmath139 is mostly due to the charge separation from the relative electron and positron drift , @xcite which leads to the onset of the secondary kink instability .",
    "the high - energy particles undergo a fast streaming motion in the @xmath9 direction but at the same time executing frequent cyclotron motion in the @xmath140 space , leading to efficient thermalization as discussed in sec .",
    "[ thermalization ] .",
    "such a strong thermalization process is not observed in previous 2d kink studies @xcite since @xmath141 induced from tearing modes in this study is much larger than in those cases @xmath142 .",
    "this might explain a relatively higher percentage of non - thermal particles found in those studies @xcite .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that , at least for the initial configuration we have studied here , the particle energization by tearing occurs mostly inside the magnetic islands and produces mostly thermal heating in both stages .",
    "but particle energization by the secondary kink instability leads to some non - thermal particles in the second kink stage .",
    "these effects could only be studied with 3d simulation of a large enough computational domain in every direction .",
    "in this paper we have presented large scale 3d particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations to examine particle energization in magnetic reconnection of relativistic electron - positron ( pair ) plasmas .",
    "these simulations are large enough to accommodate a sufficient number of tearing and kink modes .",
    "the interplay of these two main instabilities regulates the overall evolution : from the initial linear tearing and kink growth with the appearance of small magnetic islands , to the merging of small magnetic islands into a big one , establishing the major reconnection sites , to the elongated current sheet becoming unstable to the secondary kink instability , forming plasmoids .",
    "the particle energization could be divided into two main stages : ( 1 ) the tearing stage ( @xmath143 , and ( 2 ) the secondary kink stage ( @xmath144 .",

    "secondary kink instability also leads to some particle acceleration .",
    "accelerated particles are , however , observed to be thermalized . since the physical conditions for both the energization process and the thermalization process discussed in this study are quite typical in relativistic pair reconnection , we suggest that these processes are germane in understanding the magnetic energy dissipation in pair plasmas .    in a relativistic current sheet ,",
    "previous literature reported that the linear kink instability is faster than the linear tearing instability unless the reconnection is driven.@xcite in this work , contrary to the above well - known results , the linear tearing instability is faster than the linear kink instability , at least in our specific parameters .",
    "this result raises another hint to the striped wind problem.@xcite it is worth of emphasizing that all the calculations reported in this paper are done with an initial anti - parallel magnetic field without a guide field for pair plasmas .",
    "the introduction of a uniform guide field would significantly change the results as reported in @xcite .",
    "compared to a relativistic reconnection without a guide field , the reconnection rate is slower with a guide field due to a lower compressibility effect of the guide magnetic field . more importantly with a guide field ,",
    "the particle acceleration is mostly done at the reconnection site , whereas it is inside the magnetic island without a guide field.@xcite the magnetic field configuration in the real astrophysical situation such as pulsar wind would be even more complicated . we need to be cautious when trying to apply the particle energization processes reported in this paper to the real astrophysical situations .",
