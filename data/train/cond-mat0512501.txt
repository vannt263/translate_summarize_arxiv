    "our current understanding of non - equilibrium systems owes a lot to the studies of driven diffusive systems  @xcite .",
    "these are models of particles hopping from site to site on a lattice where the hopping rates do not fulfill the condition of detailed balance .",
    "even though the rules governing the stochastic dynamics are often very simple , these models show a variety of phenomena that are unknown to systems at thermodynamic equilibrium . in particular , even in one spatial dimension they can exhibit phase separation and phase transitions .",
    "biology provides ample examples of systems that are maintained out of thermodynamic equilibrium and physical studies of these systems are essential for understanding their behavior .",
    "in contrast to the driven diffusive systems mentioned before , they in general do not follow simple rules .",
    "this can be illustrated by the cytoskeleton which is a network of filamentous proteins , mainly actin - filaments and microtubules  @xcite .",
    "the cytoskeleton plays an essential role in many vital cellular processes as , for example , cell division and locomotion .",
    "cytoskeletal filaments are polar objects , because they have two structurally distinguishable ends .",
    "other proteins associated with the cytoskeleton control filament assembly and disassembly .",
    "furthermore , they can form cross - links between filaments .",
    "in addition to passive cross - links there are active cross - links formed by motor proteins . these are molecules that can move directionally along filaments .",
    "their motion is driven by the hydrolysis of adenosine - tri - phosphate during which a phosphate group is cleaved from the molecule .",
    "the chemical energy thus liberated is then transformed by the motor proteins into mechanical work .",
    "the direction of their motion is determined by the orientation of the filament . if a motor protein connects two filaments its motion results in relative motion between the filaments and creates stresses in the filament network .",
    "now each of the proteins involved in the dynamics of the cytoskeleton is already a complicated system on its own , consisting of many atoms .",
    "however , the separation of time scales allows phenomenological descriptions of the slow modes .",
    "essential features of cytoskeletal dynamics can be studied using simple models .",
    "for example , driven diffusive systems have been used to study the growth of filaments against external forces  @xcite , the motion of single motors on a filament  @xcite , as well as collective effects of motor molecules interacting through excluded volume effects  @xcite .",
    "motivated by the dynamics of bundles of polar filaments interacting with molecular motors , we study in this work a new class of driven diffusive systems .",
    "in contrast to commonly studied models , elementary events consist here of a correlated motion of two particles reflecting the effects of filament motor interactions . after defining the model class we study a sub - class that allows for an exact solution of the steady state .",
    "we identify criteria for condensation in these models . in a filament bundle",
    ", condensation corresponds to bundle shortening .",
    "we then analyze cases without exact solution by employing a mean - field approximation .",
    "finally , we look at a coarse - grained version and relate the model to phenomenological descriptions of active filament bundles . in this way we can connect the kinetic hopping rates defining the driven diffusive system to the stress generated in a filament bundle .",
    "we will now briefly review a microscopic physical model of the filament dynamics in a bundle induced by motor molecules .",
    "motivated by this model we will then define the processes that determine the class of driven diffusive systems to be studied below .      consider a bundle of polar filaments in which all filaments are aligned with respect to a common axis .",
    "each filament has one of two possible orientations which in the following will be referred to as `` plus '' and `` minus '' , respectively .",
    "filament pairs are set into relative motion by the action of molecular motors which form active cross - links . as a consequence ,",
    "the bundle can shorten and filaments can be separated according to their polarity  @xcite .    for sufficiently large filament densities , the state of the bundle can be represented by two densities corresponding to the distributions of filaments oriented in one way and the other .",
    "they are denoted @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively . due to mass conservation",
    ", the time evolution of the densities is governed by continuity equations @xmath2 the currents @xmath3 reflect various active processes in the bundle , for example the action of motors connecting filament pairs .",
    "if filaments are created and destroyed or change their orientation , then source terms have to be added on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cont ] ) . in the following ,",
    "these processes will be neglected such that the numbers of plus- and minus - filaments are both conserved independently .",
    "different approaches have been developed to derive expressions for the filament currents .",
    "phenomenological equations have been derived based on systematic expansions of the currents in terms of the filament densities and their derivatives respecting the symmetries of the system  @xcite .",
    "the same approach has been used for describing the hydrodynamics of actively propelled particles like bacteria which share a number of essential features with active filament systems  @xcite .",
    "the virtue of these approaches is that they are independent of many microscopic details of the active processes , most of which are only partially known at present . in more microscopic descriptions , expressions for the currents follow from an analysis of the action of active cross - links formed by motor molecules  @xcite .",
    "we will now discuss further the approach presented in ref .",
    "@xcite as it will form the basis for the driven diffusive systems discussed later .",
    "it is based on an analysis of the momentum flux in the bundle . since",
    "the motion of filaments in a bundle typically occurs with velocities in the order of @xmath4m / min , the dynamics is dominated by friction and inertial terms can be neglected .",
    "the conservation of momentum is thus expressed by a balance of forces .",
    "summing up all the forces acting on a filament connected to other filaments by active motors and moving against an immobile fluid leads to a general expression for the currents in terms of the internal forces . within the framework developed in ref .",
    "@xcite it is assumed that the dominant contributions to the currents result from filament pair - interactions , which is for example valid in the case of a low motor density . in the simplest case ,",
    "the motor density is not considered as a dynamic variable , such that it only enters in the parameters describing the dynamics .    for a simple model of the internal forces between filament pairs ,",
    "the current of plus - filaments is given by  @xcite @xmath5c^+(x ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\beta \\partial_x\\int_{-\\ell}^\\ell d\\xi\\ ; c^-(x+\\xi )   c^+(x)-d\\partial_{x}c^{+}(x ) + v_{\\rm tr}c^{+}(x)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this current defines the minimal model of active filament bundles .",
    "the first term describes the contribution to the current resulting from interactions between filaments of the same orientation , while the second term accounts for interactions between filaments of opposite orientation .",
    "the corresponding coupling constants are @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the integrals reflect that filaments can interact whenever they overlap , where @xmath8 is the filament length which is taken to be the same for all filaments .",
    "the terms resulting from the action of active cross - links have a simple interpretation .",
    "the interaction of filaments of the same orientation is such that , for @xmath9 , a filament pair tends to increase its overlap , while for filaments of opposite orientation the distance between their plus ends decreases if @xmath10 , see fig .",

    "finally , the convective part @xmath15 of the current has been introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe filament treadmilling . in this process filament subunits",
    "are added at the plus - end and removed with the same rate at the minus - end .",
    "this leads to an apparent motion of the filament in the direction of the plus - end while the length of the filament remains constant .",
    "the expression for the current of minus - filaments is obtained from expression ( [ eq : jmimo ] ) by interchanging the superscripts @xmath16 and @xmath17 and by replacing @xmath7 with @xmath18 as well as @xmath19 by @xmath20 .",
    "this assures that the currents transform correctly under space inversion which also transforms plus filaments into minus filaments and vice versa .",
    "furthermore , the currents respect the conservation of momentum .",
    "an analysis of the dynamic equations reveals that the important parameter for the dynamics is @xmath6 , the coupling between filaments of the same orientation .",
    "if it exceeds a critical value , a homogeneous distribution of filaments becomes unstable  @xcite .",
    "provided that @xmath21 , filaments then aggregate at some position .",
    "if on the contrary @xmath22 , then oscillatory solutions in the form of traveling waves can be generated  @xcite .",
    "the critical value @xmath23 is inversely proportional to the filament density @xmath24 of the homogeneous state , @xmath25 .",
    "we will now use these elementary processes as a motivation for defining a class of driven diffusive systems capturing essential parts of the dynamics of active filament bundles .      consider a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath26 sites . on the lattice",
    "there are two kinds of particles , referred to as `` plus '' and `` minus '' , which represent the two possible orientations of the filaments in a bundle . each site @xmath27 with @xmath28 accommodates @xmath29 particles , where @xmath30",

    "[ fig : process]a , right .",
    "the rate of such an event depends on the number of particles on sites @xmath31 and @xmath32 and is denoted by @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",

    ", it will turn out to be convenient to allow also for the opposite events to occur even though there is no direct analog in the minimal model : two particles on site @xmath27 can separate and move to sites @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively . the corresponding rate @xmath11 depends on the number of particles at @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath36 .    the next process reflects the action of a motor on a pair of oppositely oriented filaments , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : process]c , right .",
    "a plus particle at @xmath27 will exchange its position with a minus particle at @xmath32 with a rate @xmath37 that depends on @xmath38 and @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath40 .",

    "( [ eq : jmimo ] ) under the combined operation @xmath42 and space inversion , we require @xmath43 .",
    "furthermore , we allow for processes similar to diffusion : particles can spontaneously hop to the left or right neighboring site with rates @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , each of which can depend on the number of particles at the site . motivated by the behavior of the filament system under space inversion , we require @xmath46 and @xmath47 . note , that if @xmath48 then there is a spontaneous flux of particles similar to the convective term @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : jmimo ] ) .",
    "finally , the rates have to respect that a process can only take place if there is a particle at the donating site(s ) , i.e. , @xmath49 if either @xmath50 or @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .    if only one kind of particles is present and if @xmath54 , the model reduces to a class of hopping models known as zero range process ( zrp ) @xcite .",
    "in these models , the rate of a particle leaving a site depends on its occupation number but is otherwise unconstrained . in spite of this simplicity , phase transitions are found in this class even in one dimension .",
    "the zrp allows for an analytical solution of the steady state .",
    "this property is intimately linked to the factorization of the steady state probability distribution @xmath55 of having a certain configuration with @xmath56 particles at site @xmath57 .",

    "we will now analyze the case of non - vanishing @xmath35 and @xmath11 , where we focus on the case of one kind of particles .",

    "these rates fall into the class introduced in the previous section . for this process , the steady state probability distribution factorizes and has the form ( [ eq : fact ] ) . indeed , the steady state of the probability distribution @xmath76 is determined by @xmath77 & = & 0 .\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this condition is clearly fulfilled if each process occurs with the same rate as the corresponding opposite process . inserting the ansatz ( [ eq : fact ] ) , this detailed balance yields @xmath78 conditions @xmath79 with @xmath28 .",

    "the similarity of the steady state probability distribution with that of the zrp allows us to immediately carry over a number of results to our system .",
    "of particular interest in the present context are the conditions for which the particles condensate .",
    "condensation means that in the `` thermodynamic limit '' , where @xmath82 with @xmath83 , a single site is occupied by macroscopic number of particles .",
    "three cases can be distinguished as follows :    1 .   @xmath84 as @xmath85 : no condensation , the distribution of particles will be homogeneous in the limit @xmath86 .",

    "a detailed study of these non - trivial cases can be found in @xcite . ] , if @xmath91 then condensation occurs for large enough densities iff @xmath92 .",

    "the distributions show a power law with an exponent @xmath137 .",
    "the exponent is thus close to @xmath121 , which is the value obtained in the exactly solvable case .",
    "some insight into the condensation behavior of the model can be gained by using a mean - field approximation . to this end",

    "an instability of the homogenous state leads to a state where filaments condense , i.e. , accumulate at one point and can therefore be interpreted as the point where the bundle ruptures .",
    "the value of the tension at the critical point is thus the maximal tension that can be generated by a filament bundle before it tears apart .",
    "in summary , we have introduced a new class of hopping models on one - dimensional lattices .",
    "motivated by the dynamics of filaments connected by molecular motors , this class is defined by processes in which two particles hop simultaneously ; either from adjacent sites to a site in between or away from one site to both adjacent sites .",
    "this is , in particular , different from the zrp where such processes occur in an interval @xmath202 with a probability @xmath203 and are therefore neglected in comparison to processes that occur with a probability @xmath204 . as a consequence of the two - particle processes",
    "the mean - field approximation shows like the stochastic system a condensation transition .",
    "this does not hold for the mean - field analysis of the zrp . despite these important differences , for rates that have a factorized steady state probability distribution , the steady state distributions of the zrp and of the class of systems introduced here are identical .",
    "this similarity allowed us to transfer results from the zrp on the conditions of condensation to the new model class .",
    "in particular , we found that there is a critical density for condensation , if the rates approach for large occupation numbers a constant different from zero .",
    "coarse - graining of the mean - field equations allowed us to connect the kinetic hopping rates in the stochastic model to the stress generated in the bundle .",
    "the microscopic rates are thus linked to macroscopic physical quantities . apart from giving the rates a physical meaning ,",
    "this connection could be used to obtain the strength of the noise term in langevin equations for the time - evolution of the filament density . as active filament bundles are inherently out of thermodynamic equilibrium",
    "there is in general no fluctuation - dissipation theorem that would allow to determine this strength .",
    "the coarse - graining also points to limitations of continuum descriptions of active filament bundles .",
    "indeed we find that the criterion for condensation in the exactly solvable case involves only the first order correction of the rates , while the critical value in the mean - field equations depends also on the zeroth order parameter .    taken these points together",
    ", the discrete hopping models introduced here are seen to be a useful tool for analyzing the effects of fluctuations on dynamics of active filament bundles - in spite of their simplicity . in the future it will be in particular interesting to study the case of two different particles present on the lattice . in the corresponding microscopic and phenomenological descriptions ,",
    "traveling waves were found in this case ."
