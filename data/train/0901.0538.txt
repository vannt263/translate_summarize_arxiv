    "if we take different values of the central charge vector @xmath79 to correspond to different conformal field theories , it appears that there is a symmetry relating an infinite number of conformal field theory descriptions for each gravitational theory !",

    "given the fact that the cft is described by its central charge , we propose that the susy condition is related to this new invariant central charge @xmath3 .    supporting evidence for this comes from analyzing @xmath3 over the range of @xmath56 and noticing that the function features a valley along @xmath116 , see fig.[invcc ] . on the surface .",

    "it is also worth noting that in the supersymmetric limit the mass of the black hole and the angular momentum are proportional .",
    "there are three main results in this paper .",
    "the first is that the central charges and virasoro generators of the rotating black holes in five - dimensional supergravity have been calculated , and the black hole bekenstein - hawking entropy matches the conformal field theory entropy .",
    "this provides a dual holographic description of general rotating black holes in five dimensional minimal supergravity .",
    "the second is that we have found that unlike in four dimensions , the five and higher dimensional black holes have a rotational symmetry which corresponds to an apparent change of the conformal field theory description .",
    "we argue that this either suggests an large symmetry between conformal field theories or that dual description is physically described by a new central charge invariant . finally as an application",
    ", this central charge invariant is used to study the appearance of the supersymmetric bmpv limit of these black holes from the conformal field theory perspective .",

    "<S> we examine the dual conformal field theory for extremal charged black holes in five - dimensional minimal supergravity with 2 independent angular momenta . </S>",
    "<S> the conformal field theory virasoro algebra , central charge , and temperature are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> additionally the conformal field theory entropy is calculated using the cardy formula and agrees with the bekenstein - hawking black hole entropy . </S>",
    "<S> the central charges are directly proportional to the angular momentum components of the black hole . in five and higher dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> rotations of the spacetime correspond to rotations of the central charges leading to an apparent symmetry relating the conformal field theories dual to each black hole . a rotationally invariant central charge , which is proportional to the total angular momentum , is used to discuss the supersymmetric bmpv black hole limits . </S>"
