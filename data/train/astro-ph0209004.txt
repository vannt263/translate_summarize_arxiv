    "polar ring galaxies ( prgs ) represent an unusual , rare class of objects which show clear signs of galaxy interaction ( schweizer , whitmore & rubin 1983 ) . typically , an early - type ( s0 or e ) host galaxy is surrounded by a luminous ring ( containing stars , gas and dust ) of @xmath7 5 to 25  kpc diameter oriented almost perpendicular to the main stellar disk and rotating about the center of the main stellar body ( see prg atlas by whitmore et al .",
    "to - date only about a dozen prgs have been kinematically confirmed ( e.g. table 1 in sparke & cox 2000 ) . in the generally accepted picture , the formation of polar rings is the result of a  secondary event  : e.g. , capture of a satellite galaxy or accretion of material between ( tidally ) interacting galaxies involving a pre - existing s0 galaxy ( e.g. toomre & toomre 1972 , reshetnikov & sotnikova 1997 ) .",
    "recently bekki ( 1997 , 1998 ) suggested a pole - on merger between two disk galaxies as an alternative formation mechanism .",
    "observations suggest that polar rings are long - lived structures ( whitmore et al .",
    "1987 , eskridge & pogge 1997 ) .",
    "possible stabilizing mechanisms are self - gravitation in the ring ( sparke 1986 ) , or a massive triaxial halo ( whitmore et al .",
    "1987 , reshetnikov & combes 1994 )    the helix galaxy , ngc  2685 ( @xmath8 ; ( r)sb0 + pec ) is one of the kinematically confirmed prgs .",
    "two rings are detected in hi line emission which have orthogonal angular momentum vectors ( shane 1980 ) .",
    "optical and nir surface photometry ( peletier & christodoulou 1993 ) suggests an age of 2 - 6 gyr for the inner polar ring and therefore a long - lived structure .",
    "the younger hii regions in the polar ring of ngc  2685 have solar abundances , making accretion of metal - poor material unlikely ( eskridge & pogge 1997 ) .",
    "ngc  2685 was observed in its @xmath9  line with three pointings covering the entire polar ring between 2000  april and june using the six - element owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) millimeter interferometer in its c and l configurations .",
    "the resulting baselines ( 15 - 115  m ) provide a spatial resolution of @xmath10 ( 430  pc ) with natural weighting .",
    "the noise per 10@xmath11  channel is @xmath12mjybeam@xmath13 in the combined data of 6 tracks . for the intensity map",
    "only emission above the clipping level of @xmath14 was added together .",
    "the iram 30 m telescope was pointed towards six positions in ngc  2685 based on the ovro data ( indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : co ] ) .",
    "position n and w1 were observed on 2002 march 11 ( the remaining ones on may 25 ) in the @xmath9 and @xmath15 line using the two 3 mm receivers ( hpbw @xmath7 21  ) and one 1 mm receiver ( hpbw @xmath7 11  ) .",
    "the observations had a total on - source integration time of about 20  min ( w2 ) to 65  min ( n ) with an average of 35  min per position . the 1  mhz filter banks provided a velocity resolution of @xmath16  ( @xmath17 ) per channel for the @xmath9 ( @xmath15 ) line .",
    "the final r.m.s . in a smoothed 10@xmath11  wide channel was about 4mk at 115ghz and 6mk at 230ghz .",
    "we also used archival 21@xmath18 hi very large array ( vla ) data which are described in mahon ( 1992 ) .",
    "the spatial resolution of the combined data ( bnc and d configurations ) is 34.6  @xmath19 33.7  ( 12.7  @xmath19 10.8  ) for natural ( uniform ) weighting with a channel width of 20.7@xmath11 and an r.m.s . of @xmath20 mjybeam@xmath13 for natural ( uniform ) weighting .",
    "the atomic gas forms two distinct rings with radii of @xmath7 2.4 and @xmath7 0.57 which can be easily kinematically distinguished in the vla channel maps ( fig . 3.3 of mahon 1992 ) .",
    "we calculated separate data cubes which contain only emission from the inner and outer ring by blanking the according component in the individual channel maps ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hi ] ) .",
    "the velocity field of each component is well ordered and shows the spider diagram typical of an inclined rotating disk .",
    "we used tilted - ring fitting routines to derive the kinematic parameters ( inclination , position angle , dynamical center , systemic velocity ) and the hi rotation curve . the position angle ( @xmath21 ) of the kinematic major axis of the outer hi ring",
    "is aligned with the major axis of the s0 host disk ( @xmath22 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : dss ] ) .",
    "the position angle of the inner polar ring is off - set by about 70@xmath23 .",
    "however , the inclination derived for the two hi gas rings and the inner s0 host are similar ( @xmath24 ) within the errors ( see also shane 1980 , mahon 1992 ) . for the final rotation curve , we assumed that the rotation velocities in the polar ring reflect those in the hi disk at the corresponding radii ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dss ] ) .",
    "the rotation curve is consistent with solid body rotation out to a radius of @xmath25 which includes the position of the polar ring ( @xmath26 ) .    _",
    "outer hi ring : _ the outer hi ring is situated at a radius of @xmath27 ) in a large - scale ( @xmath28 ) diffuse disk .",
    "the hi column density exceeds @xmath29 in a few locations within the outer ring at scales of @xmath30 .",
    "the outer ring contains an atomic gas mass of about @xmath31 or about 62% of the total atomic gas mass ( @xmath32 ) . in the dss2 red image a very faint ring - like structure surrounding the main stellar disk",
    "( see also peletier & christodoulou 1993 ) coincides with the hi ring ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dss ] ) .",
    "the change in position angle and ellipticity at @xmath33 are indicative of a bar with a similar semi - major axis length ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dss ] ) . if we assume the standard relation between the corotation resonance ( cr ) radius and the bar semi - major axis @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , we find @xmath36 and a bar pattern speed of @xmath37 .",
    "the position of the outer lindblad resonance ( olr ) lies approximately at the radius of the hi ring under these assumptions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dss ] ) .    _",
    "polar hi ring : _ the h@xmath1 image by eskridge & pogge ( 1997 ) shows about 20 hii regions which delineate the polar ring ( fig . [",
    "fig : co ] ) .",
    "the hi polar ring coincides with the h@xmath1 and optical - continuum emission forming the polar ring ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hi ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : co ] ) .",
    "the polar hi ring contains about @xmath38 or 20% of the total atomic gas mass .",
    "this is about 4% of the dynamical mass at this radius ( @xmath39 ; assuming spherical symmetry ) .",
    "the average hi column density in the western part of the polar ring is about @xmath40 ( peak of @xmath41 ) . in the eastern part , the average hi column density is just below @xmath42 on scales of @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath9  line emission is detected with the ovro mm - interferometer in the eastern and western edge of the polar ring of ngc  2685 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : co ] ) .",
    "the co data are summarized in table 1 .",
    "no molecular line emission above 3@xmath44 is seen from the nuclear region , even when smoothed to a spectral resolution of 130@xmath11(1@xmath456mjy / beam ) .",
    "the four gmas in the polar ring are spatially unresolved at our resolution of @xmath46pc ) .",
    "the molecular gas is located close to the densest hi peaks in the polar ring ( fig .",
    "[ fig : co ] ) which are also next to the brightest h@xmath1 regions .",
    "the velocities and line widths of the molecular gas agree well with those seen in the atomic gas of the polar ring ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] ) , providing kinematic confirmation that the co emission is located in the polar ring and not in the s0 host .",
    "a comparison of the co line flux detected in the ovro data with the iram 30 m single dish line flux in the western ( eastern ) part of the ring shows that the ovro data recovers about 90 ( 40 ) % of the single dish flux ( table 1 ) .",
    "both @xmath47co  lines are detected in both sides of the polar ring with the iram single dish telescope ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "the line fwhms are fairly small ( @xmath48and @xmath49  for @xmath9  and @xmath15 ) .",
    "the properties of the gmas ( size @xmath50 , velocity widths @xmath51 ) are comparable to those seen in other galaxies ( e.g. in m  51 , aalto et al .",
    "1999 ) . using the upper mass limit of @xmath52 from position w2 ( table 1 )",
    ", we derive an upper limit for the total undetected molecular gas mass in the polar ring of about @xmath53 .",
    "the central @xmath9iram spectrum clearly shows a @xmath54 wide line at the @xmath55 level of @xmath56 . using the relation @xmath57 between the ratios of the fluxes ( @xmath58 and the beam ( @xmath59 ) and source sizes ( @xmath60 ) ( e.g. dickel 1976 ) for the iram ( i ) and ovro ( o ) data , we find that the extent of the co emission must be of the order of @xmath61 to explain the ovro non - detection .",
    "our co line fluxes for the polar ring ( region e1 and w1 ) are considerably smaller than those previously reported by watson , guptill & buchholz ( 1994 ) ( their position 3 and 7 ) .",
    "given the good agreement between our co line widths ( @xmath62 ) and the hi line width ( compared to the co line widths of @xmath63 by watson et al .",
    "1994 ) together with the consistency of the ovro and iram data , we conclude that the present data yield more accurate fluxes .",
    "the strong @xmath9  line emission apparent in the nro 45 m spectrum ( taniguchi et al .",
    "1990 ) is also inconsistent with our nuclear line flux .",
    "the ( detected ) molecular gas mass of the polar ring is only about 4% of the atomic mass present there ( @xmath64 ) , and the ratio between the blue luminosity and the molecular gas mass is also fairly low ( @xmath65 ) using @xmath66 of richter , sackett & sparke 1994 ) .",
    "these values are comparable to those found for low - mass ( @xmath67 ) very late - type galaxies ( i.e. including dwarf irregulars , casoli et al . 1998 ) and s0 galaxies with counter - rotating gas / stars ( bettoni et al . 2001 ) .    the low far - infrared luminosity of @xmath68 ( using the iras fluxes and the standard relation for @xmath69 ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ) indicates no recent _ massive _ star formation as observed in starburst galaxies in the ngc  2685 system .",
    "this is in agreement with the old age ( @xmath70 ) of the nuclear stellar population ( silchenko 1998 ) .",
    "all this implies that there was no considerable gas inflow into the central kiloparsec in the recent past .",
    "this appears to contradict the models of the pole - on disk merger ( bekki 1998 ) and polar encounter with a spiral galaxy ( reshetnikov & sotnikova 1997 ) , which show an accumulation of a few @xmath71 in the central kiloparsec .",
    "( our derived molecular gas mass in the inner kiloparsec is only about @xmath72 . )",
    "the host disk of ngc  2685 exhibits no obvious sign of an interaction besides the more extended diffuse hi emission at the north - eastern edge of the disk ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hi ] )",
    ". we can use equation ( 29 ) of lake & norman ( 1983 ) which relates the density of the accreted dwarf to the mean density of the parent galaxy inside the radius of the orbit . for a dynamical mass of @xmath73 inside the ring radius for the host galaxy , and a total mass of @xmath74 ( assuming a typical scale factor of 5 between the hi mass and the dynamical mass for dwarf galaxies ; e.g. swaters 1999 ) , we find a radius for the accreted dwarf galaxy of about 2.2kpc .",
    "this radius and the hi mass of @xmath75 are typical values for late - type dwarf galaxies ( mateo 1998 , swaters 1999 ) .",
    "since the ring appears in its colors neither very young ( @xmath76 ) nor extremely ancient ( peletier & christodoulou 1993 ) , it seems likely that the polar ring was formed a few gyr ago during an accretion event ( of a dwarf / low - mass galaxy ) similar to those proposed for s0 counter - rotators .",
    "the solar metallicity derived for the ring hii regions ( eskridge & pogge 1997 ) implies that either ( 1 ) the accreted dwarf galaxy had an elevated intrinsic metallicity similar to those observed in a couple local dwarf galaxies ( e.g. mateo 1998 ) , ( 2 ) low - level continuous star formation has enriched the polar ring ism in the past few gyr ( see e.g. legrand et al .",
    "2001 ) and/or ( 3 ) the ism of the accreted dwarf galaxy was mixed / enriched with more metal - rich material from the primary galaxy .    the outer hi ring can be explained as gas accumulated at the olr of the 11kpc diameter bar .",
    "the good spatial correspondence of the optical and hi rings suggests that there is enhanced star formation .",
    "we conclude that the suggested scenario by peletier & christodoulou ( 1993 ) seems unlikely , where the outer hi ring has been formed during the secondary accretion event which formed the inner polar ring as well .",
    "the ovro map of the molecular gas provides the first unambiguous ( kinematically confirmed ) detection of molecular gas in a polar ring .",
    "this molecular gas is associated with about four gmas which are located close to on - going star formation and peaks in the atomic gas which exceed @xmath77 .",
    "note that the molecular and the atomic gas appear concentrated where the polar ring intersects the disk of the parent galaxy .",
    "the polar ring exhibits at least two stellar populations .",
    "the hii regions present in the polar ring have an average age of 5myr ( if instantaneous star formation is assumed ) and about solar metallicity ( eskridge & pogge 1997 ) . however , peletier & christodoulou ( 1993 ) deduced an age of a few gyr from the red colors of the polar ring .",
    "the contribution of the atomic gas in the polar ring to the total dynamical mass ( enclosed out to its radius ) is about 4% .",
    "this might already be enough to allow for self - gravitation of the polar ring , and explain its persistence ( sparke 1986 ) .",
    "alternatively , mahon ( 1992 ) has found that the hi distribution and kinematics of ngc  2685 can be stable using models of prograde anomalous orbits in a triaxial gravitational potential .",
    "thus we conclude that : ( a ) the polar ring has been stable for a substantial time ( few gyr ) and ( b ) the recent star formation in the polar ring has been triggered by another mechanism than the actual polar ring formation process .",
