    "quasars at high redshift are excellent tools to investigate the formation of galaxies and supermassive black holes in the early universe , and to probe the physical state of their galactic environment up to early cosmic epochs . in recent years",
    "there is growing evidence that quasar activity and the formation of their host galaxies , in particular of massive spheroidal systems , are closely related .",
    "the presence of dark massive objects ( dmos ) in the center of nearly every galaxy with a significant spheroidal component supports models that connect the formation and evolution of galaxies with quasar activity .",
    "it has been shown that the mass of the dmos , generally regarded as super - massive black holes , is closely correlated with the spheroidal mass of the host - galaxy ( e.g. , kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al.1998 ; richstone et al.1998 ; gebhardt et al.2000 ; merritt & ferrarese 2001 ; tremaine et al.2002 ) . in the context of galaxy evolution",
    ", the conditions that give rise to quasars and massive black holes will also yield solar or super - solar metallicities on time scales shorter than @xmath10gyr ( arimoto & yoshii 1987 ; hamann & ferland 1993 ; gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; friaa & terlevich 1998 ; cen & ostriker 1999 ; romano et al.2002 ) .",
    "additional strong evidence for the relationship between quasar activity , host galaxy formation , and intense star formation episodes is provided by the detection of large amounts of dust ( @xmath11m@xmath12 ) and molecular gas ( @xmath13m@xmath12 ) measured in high redshift quasars ( andreani , lafranca , & cristiani 1993 ; isaak et al.1994 ; omont et al.1996,2001 ; carilli et al.2000,2001 ) .",
    "the co - moving number density of quasars and the cosmic star formation rate are both at least one order of magnitude larger for epochs with @xmath14 than in the local universe ( e.g. , gallego et al.1995 ; lilly et al.1996 ; connolly et al.1997 ; tresse & maddox 1998 ; steidel et al.1999 ; lanzetta et al.2002 ) .",
    "the evolution of the space densities of quasars and galaxies with starburst activity are also very similar .",
    "finally , there may be a relation between the luminosity functions of normal galaxies and quasars ( e.g. , dickinson 1998 ; pettini et al.1998 ; boyle & terlevich 1998 ) .",
    "quasars at high redshift are therefore of interest as valuable probes to date the beginning of the first star formation episodes in the early universe ( hamann & ferland 1992,1993,1999 ; dietrich et al.1999,2000 ) .",
    "currently , about 350 quasars with redshifts @xmath15 are known ( e.g. , schneider et al.1991a , b ; storrie - lombardi et al.1996 ; anderson et al.2001 ; djorgovski 2002 ) , and several quasars with @xmath16 and even @xmath17 have been recently discovered ( fan et al.1999,2000a , b,2001 ; stern et al.2000 ; zheng et al.2000 ; sharp et al.2001 ; becker et al.2001 ) .",
    "the redshift range @xmath18 corresponds to an epoch when the universe was less than @xmath19%  of its current age ( h@xmath20 kms@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ; carroll , press , & turner 1992 ) .",
    "the chemical composition of the gas associated with quasars can be estimated using the broad emission lines in the ultraviolet spectral range ( for a review , see hamann & ferland 1999 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the strengths of prominent metal lines , such as iv civ@xmath21 , relative to ly@xmath22 are not sensitive to the overall metallicity for @xmath23 ( hamann & ferland 1999 ) . shields ( 1976 ) proposed that the relative nitrogen abundance could be used as an indirect metallicity indicator . assuming that the secondary nitrogen production , i.e. , the synthesis of nitrogen from existing carbon and oxygen via cno burning in intermediate mass stars ( tinsley 1980 ; henry et al.2000 ) , is the dominant source for nitrogen , this results in @xmath24 and hence @xmath25",
    ". observations of hii regions indicate that secondary nitrogen production and the @xmath24 scaling dominate when the metallicity is above @xmath26 to @xmath27 solar ( shields 1976 ; pagel & edmunds 1981 ; van zee et al.1998 ; izotov & thuan 1999 ; pettini et al.2002 ) .",
    "it has been noted ( henry et al .",
    "2000 ; kobulnicky & skillman 1996 ) that departures from the simple @xmath24 relationship can occur if the enrichment is dominated by star formation in discrete bursts .",
    "this situation leads to time - dependent fluctuations in the n / o ratio because of different delays in the stellar release of n and o ( and c ) .",
    "however , the overall trend for increasing n / o with o / h remains .",
    "moreover , there are no reports , to our knowledge , of large n / o ratios in metal poor interstellar gas .",
    "large n / o abundances are an indicator of high metallicities in any scenario that involves a well - mixed interstellar medium .",
    "early investigations of the abundances in broad emission - line region ( belr ) gas were based on several generally weak inter - combination lines like niv]@xmath28 , oiii]@xmath29 , niii]@xmath30 , and iii ciii]@xmath31 ( shields 1976 ; davidson 1977 ; baldwin & netzer 1978 ; osmer 1980 ; gaskell et al.1981 ; uomoto 1984 ) .",
    "the results of these studies already indicated larger than solar metallicity for the belr gas .",
    "recent studies of high - redshift quasars ( @xmath32 ) provide evidence for significantly enhanced metallicities up to several times solar .",
    "these results obtained by studying the emission line properties of quasars ( hamann & ferland 1992,1993 ; ferland et al.1996 ; dietrich et al.1999,2002a ; dietrich & wilhelm - erkens 2000 ; hamann et al.2002 ; warner et al.2002 ) have been corroborated by studies of the intrinsic absorption lines ( petitjean et al.1994 ; mller et al.1994 ; hamann 1997 ; pettini 1999 ) .",
    "the derived high chemical abundances require an era of major star formation at some earlier epoch .",
    "hamann & ferland ( 1992,1993 ) and ferland et al.(1996 ) show that emission line ratios involving nv@xmath33 are particularly valuable .",
    "generally , it is observed that nv@xmath33 is stronger than expected in the spectra of high redshift quasars compared to standard photoionization models with solar abundance .",
    "assuming nitrogen scales roughly as @xmath34 at solar and higher metallicities hamann & ferland ( 1992,1993 ) suggest nv@xmath33/iv civ@xmath21 and nv@xmath33/heii@xmath35 as valuable metallicity indicators .",
    "recently , hamann et al.(2002 ) presented results of a detailed investigation on the influence of the photoionizing continuum flux and spectral shape , density , and metallicity on emission line ratios .",
    "they further quantified the metallicity and @xmath36 dependence of various line ratios , including several weak inter - combination lines .",
    "they favor niii]@xmath30/oiii]@xmath29 and nv@xmath33/(ovi@xmath37 iv civ@xmath21 ) line ratios as the most robust indicators to measure the gas chemical composition .    in section 2",
    "we describe the sample of the @xmath38 quasars studied here . in section 3",
    "the results of the analysis of the emission line spectra are presented .",
    "we estimate the elemental abundance of the line emitting gas based on several diagnostic emission line ratios ( hamann et al.2002 ) . using these emission - line ratios , the mean metallicity is @xmath39 for the belr gas of the quasar sample we observed .",
    "the results are discussed and compared with previous studies ( e.g. , ferland et al.1996 ; hamann & ferland 1999 ; dietrich et al.1999,2002a ; dietrich & wilhelm - erkens 2000 ; hamann et al.2002 ; warner et al.2002 ) in section 4 .",
    "the chemical composition of the belr gas provides further evidence that the first episodes of major star formation started at a redshift of @xmath40 , corresponding to an age of the universe of several @xmath5 years .",
    "this result is in good agreement with recent model predictions relating quasar activity with the formation of massive spheroidal systems , e.g. , the progenitors of early type galaxies . in the following we assume @xmath6 kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "we have compiled spectra for a sample of 70 high redshift quasars ( @xmath41 ) to study the chemical composition of the belr gas and its implications on the star formation history in quasar host galaxies in the early universe .",
    "most of the quasars at redshift @xmath42 were observed by constantin et al.(2002 ) .",
    "they recorded high signal - to - noise moderate resolution spectra over multiple observing runs at the multiple mirror telescope observatory ( mmt ) and the w.m.keck observatory .",
    "the spectral wavelength range was chosen to cover the redshifted ly@xmath43 to heii@xmath35 emission lines .",
    "dietrich et al.(1999,2002a ) observed a small sample of 11 quasars with @xmath42 using fors1 at the vlt unit telescope _ antu _ in 1998 and 1999 .",
    "these spectra cover a rest - frame wavelength range of @xmath44 .",
    "this wide range allows measurements of not only ly@xmath43 up to the heii@xmath35 emission line , but also ovi@xmath45 , niii]@xmath30 , and in some cases even iii ciii]@xmath31 . the high redshift quasar sample was complemented by observations which were kindly provided by sargent et al.(1988,1989 ) , schneider et al.(1991a , b ) , storrie - lombardi et al.(1996 ) , and steidel & sargent ( unpublished ) .",
    "in particular , the quasar spectra obtained by storrie - lombardi et al.(1996 ) cover the wavelength range containing ovi@xmath45 for many of the sources observed by constantin et al.(2002 ) .",
    "multiple spectra of the same object were combined whenever possible .",
    "broad - absorption line quasars ( balqsos ) were excluded from this study , although there are indications that their emission line properties do not differ from non - bal quasars ( weymann et al.1991 ) . in table 1 , we list the quasars used in this study together with their redshifts , intrinsic continuum luminosity @xmath46 ( corrected for galactic extinction ; dietrich et al.2002b ) , the covered restframe wavelength range , and the references for the observations .",
    "comparing mean spectra of the @xmath42 quasars with those at @xmath47 constantin et al.(2002 ) found evidence for enhanced nv@xmath33 emission strength in the high - z quasar spectra indicating high metallicities . in the following we present quantitative metallicity estimates for each individual quasar based on several measured emission line ratios .",
    "the quasar spectra were transformed to their restframe using the redshifts listed in table 1 . to determine the redshift for each quasar we fit a gaussian profile to the upper part of the iv civ@xmath21 emission line ( @xmath48%  of the peak intensity ) .    to measure integrated emission line fluxes",
    ", we corrected each quasar spectrum for fe emission and the weak contribution of balmer continuum emission while simultaneously obtaining a power - law fit representing the quasar continuum .",
    "the power - law fit , f@xmath49 , was calculated using small spectral regions , each 10 to 20   wide , which are free of detectable emission lines , at @xmath50 , 1340 , 1450 , 1700 , 1830 , and 1960 , respectively . to estimate the contribution of the balmer continuum and fe line emission",
    ", we used our results from the analysis of quasar composite spectra based on a large quasar sample of about 750 quasars ( dietrich et al.2002b ) . for the balmer continuum emission",
    ", we calculated a template spectrum with t@xmath51k , @xmath52 , and n@xmath53@xmath54 following grandi ( 1982 ) and storey & hummer ( 1995 ) .",
    "the fe emission was defined by an empirical template spectrum ( vestergaard & wilkes 2001 ) and the results of detailed model calculations ( verner et al.1999 ) .",
    "the empirical emission template accounts for both feii  and feiii  emission .",
    "the spectral width of the fe emission features was adjusted to the fwhm of the iv civ@xmath21 emission line profile of each quasar .",
    "we found that the strength of the balmer continuum emission and of the fe line emission can be estimated as a fraction of the integrated _ pseudo continuum _ flux in the wavelength range @xmath55 .",
    "the balmer continuum emission contributes approximately @xmath56%  and the fe emission amounts to @xmath57%  ( dietrich et al.2002b ) . in spite of this small contributions , the estimate of the fe line emission improves especially the measurements of niii]@xmath30 and lines such as heii@xmath35 near the @xmath58  feature ( laor et al.1994 ; vestergaard & wilkes 2001 ) .    the iv civ@xmath21 line profile was fitted with a broad and narrow gaussian component .",
    "the approach to reconstruct the emission line profiles with two gaussian components was chosen to measure the integrated line flux ; however , each individual component has no physical meaning by itself .",
    "these components have been used as a template to measure the other emission line fluxes . in using this approach to fit other emission lines , the widths of the broad and narrow component",
    "were fixed in velocity space while their strengths were allowed to vary independently .",
    "furthermore , shifts in velocity space of each component were restricted to a range of less than a few 100kms@xmath7 with respect to iv civ@xmath21 .",
    "using the components of the iv civ@xmath21 emission line as templates is particularly important for measuring nv@xmath33 and heii@xmath35 because they are blended with other emission lines .",
    "furthermore , employing the iv civ  line profile as a template provides measurements of important weak lines like niii]@xmath30 and niv]@xmath28 which are usually difficult to measure .",
    "this template - fitting approach is well justified because iv civ@xmath21 , nv@xmath33 , and heii@xmath35 are all high ionization lines ( hil ) .",
    "figure 1 show typical examples of the deblending of the ly@xmath59 - nv@xmath33 , iv civ@xmath21 - heii@xmath35 - oiii]@xmath29 , and niii]@xmath30 emission line profile complexes , respectively .",
    "the measurement of the niv]@xmath28 emission line flux is severely affected by the blue wing of the broad iv civ  component .",
    "particularly , for quasars with broad emission line profiles , the niv]@xmath28 line tends to show a low contrast to the outer part of the iv civ@xmath21 line profile ( see dietrich & hamann 2003 , in prep . for further discussion ) .",
    "the ovi@xmath45 emission line flux has been corrected for ly@xmath43 forest absorption shortward of the ly@xmath22 emission line . for this correction we assumed that the quasars show an intrinsic unabsorbed continuum slope of @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) for @xmath62 , following telfer et al.(2002 ) .",
    "provided that the same fraction of the continuum and ovi@xmath45 emission line flux were absorbed , we estimated a corresponding correction factor .",
    "the integrated ovi@xmath45 flux was corrected by this factor , which varied from 1.17 to 2.77 , with an average of @xmath63 .",
    "the uncertainties of the flux measurements were estimated from the multi - component line fit using the scaled iv civ@xmath21 line profile to obtain a minimum @xmath64 of the fit . for the stronger lines like ly@xmath59 , nv@xmath33 , siiv@xmath65 , iv civ@xmath21 , and iii ciii]@xmath31 the errors are of the order of @xmath19% ; for the weaker lines , they are @xmath66% . these errors",
    "do not take into account the uncertainties introduced by the placement of the continuum .",
    "while the strength of strong emission lines like iv civ@xmath21 is not changed significantly , the emission line flux of weaker lines like niv]@xmath28 can be underestimated by a factor of as much as @xmath67 ( dietrich & hamann 2003 , in prep . ) .",
    "we calculated emission line ratios relating nitrogen lines with lines of helium , oxygen , and carbon to derive the chemical composition of the belr gas at high redshifts .",
    "these line ratios are used to estimate the chemical abundances employing the results of hamann et al.(2002 ) .",
    "they studied in detail the dependence of emission line ratios from the gas metallicity and the shape of the ionizing continuum . for several metallicities and continuum shapes , they calculated grids of photoionization models spanning a wide range of density , @xmath68 , and continuum strength , @xmath69 , using cloudy ( ferland et al.1998 ) .",
    "the metallicity was varied from @xmath70 to @xmath71 with all of the metals scaled in solar ratios , except @xmath72 .",
    "three different input continua were used  a broken power - law continuum with an uv bump ( mathews & ferland 1987 ) , a single power - law continuum with @xmath73 , and a segmented power - law that provides the best match to recent observations ( zheng et al.1997 ; laor et al.1997 ) . for more details of the model calculations ,",
    "see hamann et al.(2002 ) .",
    "the gas metallicity as provided by each of the emission line ratios is presented in figure 2 , assuming a segmented power - law continuum .",
    "the uncertainties of the emission line flux measurements are propagated for each line ratio and are used to infer an error of each metallicity estimate .",
    "the most reliable line ratios are niii]/oiii ] and nv/(ovi@xmath74iv civ ) .",
    "in particular , niii]/oiii ] , nv/(ovi@xmath74iv civ ) , and nv / iv civ  provide reasonably consistent results . in spite of some differences , the individual metallicities of all line",
    "ratios indicate several times solar metallicity for the line emitting gas close to the quasars at @xmath38.% . ]    generally , the estimates of the metallicity based on these ratios are nearly independent of the shape of the photoionizing continuum ( hamann et al.2002 ) . for comparison , we also estimated metallicities , using each line ratio , which were calculated with a hard power - law continuum ( @xmath75 ) and a sed of the ionizing continuum as suggested by mathews & ferland ( 1987 ) .",
    "the derived metallicities differ by less than @xmath76%  in most cases .",
    "the strongest influence of the input continuum shape is for nv / heii , which amounts to a factor of @xmath67 between the two most different continuum shapes .",
    "however , hamann & ferland ( 1993 ) and ferland et al.(1996 ) noted that this line ratio provides a firm lower limit on @xmath77 when adopting belr parameters that maximize the predicted nv / heii  line ratio , e.g. , a hard power - law continuum ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "table 2 lists the mean and median metallicities which we derived for each of the individual emission line ratios . to estimate the uncertainty of the mean metallicities inferred for each line ratio",
    ", we used the errors of the line ratios which are implied by the individual line flux measurements , @xmath78 ( see section 3 ) .",
    "in addition , the width of the distribution of the metallicities based on the corresponding line ratio for each quasar was taken into account using the rms of the mean , i.e. , @xmath79 ( bevington 1969 ) .",
    "these both contribution are used in quadrature , i.e. , @xmath80 , to estimate the errors of the mean metallicities in table 2 .    for 35 of the 70 high - redshift quasars",
    "we could compare the chemical abundance based on niii]/oiii ] and the ratios involving nv@xmath33 ( figure 3 ) .",
    "although nv / iv civ , as well as nv / ovi  tend to yield higher metallicities than niii]/oiii ] , even this latter line ratio indicates several times solar metallicity .",
    "the mean metallicities inferred by nv / iv civ , nv / ovi  and nv/(ovi@xmath74iv civ ) are only larger by a factor of @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath82 , respectively , than those derived from niii]/oiii ] ( table 2 ) .",
    "only a few high redshift quasars differ significantly from the shown trend ( figs.3a , 3b , and 3c ) .",
    "hence , emission line ratios involving niii ] and nv  provide reasonably consistent estimates of the gas metallicity for quasars .",
    "the line ratio nv / heii  shows the largest difference in the metallicity estimates in comparison with niii]/oiii ] ( fig.3d ) . however , this ratio is particularly sensitive to the uncertain ionizing continuum shape ( hamann et al.2002 ) .",
    "the metallicities we obtained for nv / heii  using a hard power - law continuum agree better with the values provided by niii]/oiii ] .",
    "the average metallicity based on niii]/oiii ] ( segmented power - law ) and nv / heii  based on a hard power - law ( @xmath73 ) are very similar ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively ) .",
    "the niii]/iii ciii ] ratio tends to indicate lower chemical composition than the other line ratios ( fig.2 ) , i.e. , solar to two times solar metallicity .",
    "however , this line ratio is known to be more dependent on the temperature of the gas than niii]/oiii ] , and the critical densities of niii ] and iii ciii ] differ by a factor of @xmath67 . hence , niii]/iii ciii ] is not as robust as niii]/oiii ] ; emission in niii ] and iii ciii ] may also occur in spatially different parts of the line emitting region with different physical conditions ( hamann et al.2002 ) .",
    "in addition , the @xmath85 abundance may exhibit a secondary - like behavior at large @xmath86 , similar to , but not as sharply rising as , @xmath24 ( henry et al.2000 ) .",
    "we estimate that , if this @xmath85 behavior was folded into the calculations of hamann et al.(2002 ) , the metallicities inferred from niii]/iii ciii ] would be @xmath67 times larger , while the result based on nv / iv civ  and nv/(ovi@xmath74iv civ ) would be unchanged ( because iv civ  is already thermalized and a dominant coolant ; see hamann & ferland 1999 ) , suggesting this effect is probably operating .",
    "figures 4 and 5 compare the metallicities we calculated based on the remaining line ratios .",
    "the metallicities derived from the nv  ratios agree reasonably well with each other . for several quasars",
    "we could also compare the metallicities inferred by niv]/oiii ] with the results obtained using flux ratios including niii ] and nv .",
    "in figure 4d the metallicities given by niv]/oiii ] are plotted versus those derived from nv / iv civ .",
    "although the scatter is quite large , the average metallicities indicated by each line ratio are consistent with @xmath87%  with each other .",
    "the comparison of the metallicities calculated using niv]/oiii ] and niii]/oiii ] are displayed in figure 5c .",
    "the chemical composition indicated by these line ratios is consistent within a factor of @xmath88 .",
    "the niv]/iv civ  line ratio indicates in general lower metallicities than the other ratios ( figures 2 , 5a , 5b , and table 2 ) .",
    "the tendency toward a significantly lower metallicity based on niv]/iv civ   was also noted by shemmer & netzer ( 2002 ) .",
    "the average metallicity indicated by niv]/iv civ  is a factor of @xmath89 lower than those given by nv/(ovi@xmath74iv civ ) .",
    "the physical reason for this difference is hitherto not understood .",
    "the metallicity estimates based on niv]/iv civ  may appear low in part due to the difficulty in measuring the line flux of the weak niv]@xmath28 emission line .",
    "in particular , for quasars with broad emission line profiles the niv]@xmath28 line is located in the outer wing of the iv civ@xmath21 profile . with a typical strength of about @xmath90%  of the iv civ@xmath21 line flux for solar metallicity , this line can be well hidden in the outer blue wing of iv civ .",
    "however , a close inspection of the quasar spectra already indicates that not enough flux can be assigned to niv]@xmath28 to achieve a niv]/iv civ   line ratio that is consistent with the high metallicities indicated by the other emission line ratios .",
    "another problem with this emission line ratio is that it compares an inter - combination ( semi - forbidden ) line to a strong permitted line , whose optical depths differ by several orders of magnitude . the ratio , therefore , is strongly sensitive to ambiguities in the radiative transfer , e.g. , turbulent line broadening .    in figures 6a and 6b , the mean metallicity based on the nv  line ratios is compared with those obtained from line ratios involving inter - combination lines .",
    "the average metallicity based on nv  line ratios indicates higher abundances than those inferred from inter - combination line ratios ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively ) .",
    "although a nitrogen overabundance is commonly assumed as the cause of nv   enhancement , scattered ly@xmath43 and continuum emission by outflowing broad absorption line ( bal ) gas clouds would tend to bring the nv  and intercombination estimates into better agreement . however , it is still an open question whether all quasars have bal type outflow that results in absorption lines visible only from certain viewing angles .",
    "several models of an outflowing bal wind have been studied ( surdej & hutsemeker 1987 ; hamann , korista , & morris 1993 ; krolik & voit 1998 ) .",
    "hamann & korista ( 1996 ) found that only a fraction of the nv@xmath33 emission can be ascribed to scattering in the bal region .",
    "they estimate upper limits of @xmath93%  for nv@xmath33 and @xmath94%  for iv civ@xmath21 .",
    "we used these upper limits to recalculate the emission line ratios involving nv  and iv civ .",
    "the scattered light corrected line ratios indicate chemical compositions which are in better agreement with niii]@xmath30/oiii]@xmath29 ( table 2 ) .",
    "hence , the main result is still valid that the metallicity of the gas closely related to quasars at high redshift is several times solar .",
    "in addition to the mean metallicity based on the individual ratios ( table 2 ) , we calculated the overall mean metallicity of the high-@xmath95 quasar sample . for each quasar",
    "an average metallicity was calculated using the estimates from the line ratios measured in the individual spectra .",
    "furthermore , we have calculated average metallicities for each quasar based on the inter - combinations lines , as well as on the nv  line ratios , only .",
    "table 2 lists the average metallicity calculated using all line ratios available for each quasar .",
    "these average overall abundances are plotted as a function of redshift in figure 7 .",
    "the overall metallicity for the 70 high redshift quasars is 4 to 5 times solar ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "it should be kept in mind that all of the metallicity estimates given in this paper would be @xmath97%  lower if we used the new solar abundances from holweger ( 2001 ) and allende prieto , lambert , & asplund ( 2001,2002 ) .",
    "we used our quasar sample to test the potential existence of such a @xmath98 ",
    "@xmath99 relation at high redshifts .",
    "we calculated the rest - frame continuum luminosity for each quasar in our sample , l@xmath100 , at @xmath101 .",
    "the investigated high redshift quasars cover a range of @xmath102 ergs@xmath7@xmath7 .",
    "most of the quasars show a luminosity of log@xmath103 . in figure 8",
    ", the average metallicity calculated from all ratios in each quasar , is shown as a function of intrinsic continuum luminosity @xmath104 for the quasars of our sample . a weak trend of increasing @xmath105 toward higher luminosity is visible .",
    "we calculated a least square fit to the luminosity ",
    "@xmath105 distribution shown in figure 8 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the correlation , which shows considerable scatter and spans a small range in luminosity , is marginally significant , with a 6%  probability of arising by chance ( 70 measurements and correlation coefficient @xmath106 ; bevington 1969 ) .",
    "although the correlation is not very significant , it provides an additional indication for a luminosity  metallicity ( l  @xmath105 ) relation for quasars ( hamann & ferland 1993,1999 ) .",
    "we are currently in the process of analyzing a sample of @xmath107 quasars in order to study the evolution of their properties , and find for these objects a trend of increasing metallicity with increasing luminosity ( dietrich & hamann 2003 ) .",
    "the high metallicities we derived for the belr gas of the quasars at @xmath18 provide important information about the preceding star formation epoch that is required to enrich the gas .",
    "this star formation epoch might also mark the time of the formation of the quasar host galaxies .",
    "several groups have noted that the observed elemental abundances near quasars are consistent with normal chemical enrichment in the cores of massive galaxies . in particular , one - zone chemical evolution models using with a relatively flat imf ( compared to the solar neighborhood ) typically achieve supersolar gas - phase metallicities in less than @xmath10 gyr ( e.g. , hamann & ferland 1992 , 1993 ; matteucci 1992 ; matteucci & padovani 1993 ; padovani & matteucci 1993 ) .",
    "comparable short times scales for attaining metal rich gas are predicted by more recent multi - zone models that follow the dynamical and chemical evolution of forming galaxies ( e.g. , friaa & terlevich 1998 ; granato et al.2001 ; romano et al.2002 ) . in the multi - zone models ,",
    "intense star formation on short time scales occurs only in the central region of the quasar host galaxy ( @xmath108 kpc ) and the predicted luminosities of the evolving galaxies are an order of magnitude lower luminosities than the obtained with single - zone models .",
    "super - solar metallicities are predicted to occur within @xmath109 gyrs for these central regions ( friaa & terlevich 1998 ; romano et al.2002 ) .",
    "based on the timescale for enriching the belr gas of the high - redshift quasars in this study , the beginning of the first star formation epoch can be estimated .",
    "a redshift @xmath18 corresponds to an age of the universe of less than @xmath110gyrs ( @xmath6kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) .",
    "assuming @xmath2gyrs for the star formation needed to enrich the gas , the first major star formation epoch started at @xmath4 for observed quasars at @xmath111 .",
    "it is interesting to note that this is comparable to the epoch of re - ionization of the universe ( haiman & loeb 1998 ; becker et al.2001 ; fan et al.2002 ) .",
    "these results are also consistent with cosmic structure formation models ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) which are suggesting that the rapid assembly of ( at least some ) massive spheroidal systems , accompanied by intense star formation , started at @xmath112 . assuming",
    "that at the end of the major star formation episode in the early phase of galaxy evolution , quasar activity starts in a chemical highly enriched environment ( e.g. , granato et al.2001 ; romano et al.2002 ) the formation of spheroidal systems might continue until @xmath47 ( madau et al.1996 ; friaa & terlevich 1998 ; steidel 1999 ) .",
    "the metallicities presented here and by dietrich et al.(2002a ) based on the emission lines in quasars at @xmath42 are consistent with previous emission line studies of @xmath113 quasar samples .",
    "in particular , there is no evidence for a decline in the metallicity from @xmath47 to @xmath114 ( see also dietrich & hamann 2003 ) .    in the context of galaxy evolution models , higher metallicities and shorter evolution timescales",
    "are expected for more massive stellar systems ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; cen & ostriker 1999 ; kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; nolan et al.2001 ) .",
    "the close connection of quasars and the formation of massive galaxies is supported by the relation of the black hole mass and the mass of the spheroidal galaxy component ( e.g. , gebhardt et al.2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2001 ) . for elliptical galaxies ,",
    "a mass  metallicity relation has been well known for several decades ( sandage 1972 ; faber 1973 ; bica et al.1988 ) .",
    "hence , a similar mass ",
    "metallicity relation can be expected for quasars .",
    "indeed , there is some evidence for a correlation of metallicity and luminosity , i.e. , with the black hole mass of quasars , based on broad emission line studies similar to the analysis we present in this paper ( hamann & ferland 1993 ; shemmer & netzer 2002 ; warner et al.2003 ) .",
    "we investigated rest - frame ultraviolet spectra with moderate spectral resolution of a sample of @xmath115 high redshift quasars with @xmath0 .",
    "we used emission - line flux ratios involving carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , and helium to estimate the metallicity of the line - emitting gas . to transform the observed line ratios into metallicities",
    ", we used the results of detailed photoionization calculations as described by hamann et al.(2002 ) .",
    "a comparison of the gas chemical composition derived from emission line ratios involving niii ] and nv  indicates reasonable consistent estimates of the gas metallicity .",
    "the estimates of the chemical abundances based on niii]/oiii ] and nv / ovi , nv/(ovi@xmath74iv civ ) , and nv / iv civ  differ by @xmath116% .",
    "based on eight individual emission line ratios we estimated an average overall metallicity for the 70 high redshift quasars of roughly @xmath117 .",
    "assuming an upper limit contribution of scattered ly@xmath22 emission of @xmath93%  to the observed nv@xmath33 emission ( hamann & korista 1996 ) , the average metallicity of the belr gas at high redshifts is still super - solar , within @xmath118%  of the estimate above .",
    "compared to previous studies , we find no evidence for an evolutionary trend in quasar metallicities from @xmath47 to @xmath42 .",
    "we analyze the derived elemental abundances within the context of models presented by hamann & ferland ( 1993 ) and friaa & terlevich ( 1998 ) . with an evolution time scale of approximately @xmath119gyrs",
    ", the epoch of the first intense star formation is estimated to begin as early as at a redshift of @xmath120 , i.e. , less than 1 gyr of the age of the universe ( h@xmath121 kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) .",
    "we find a weak trend of a @xmath98 ",
    "@xmath105 relation for the high redshift quasars . due to the scatter in metallicity and the small range of covered luminosity",
    "the probability for a correlation by chance is @xmath122% .",
    "however , the trend is in good agreement with results obtained for quasars at lower redshift ( hamann & ferland 1999 ) and for composite spectra based on a large quasar sample , which we are currently investigating ( dietrich et al . 2002b ; warner et al.2003 ) .",
