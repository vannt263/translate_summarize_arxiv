    "it is no secret that the cost of configuring and maintaining natural language interfaces to databases is one of the main obstacles to their wider adoption@xcite .",
    "while recent work has focused on learning approaches , there are less costly alternatives based on only lightly naming database elements ( e.g. relations , attributes , values ) and reducing question interpretation to graph match @xcite .",
    "what is particularly compelling about precise @xcite is the claim that for a large and well defined class of _ semantically tractable _ questions , one can guarantee correct translation to sql . furthermore precise leverages off - the - shelf open domain syntactic parsers to help guide query interpretation , thus requiring no tedious grammar configuration .",
    "unfortunately after precise was introduced there has not been much if any follow up .",
    "this paper aims to evaluate these claims by implementing the model and conducting experiments equivalent those done by the designers of precise .",
    "consider the example database schema depicted at the top of figure [ fig : db ] .",
    "although this schema is small , it contains a many - to - many - relationship ( movies to theaters ) and a many - to - one relation from movie to studio .",
    "the schema is also cyclic ( via foreign key - based joins ) based on the somewhat contrived foreign key ` premier ` from ` studio ` to ` theater ` to indicate that a studio shows their premiers in a specific theater .",
    "databases are represented as a disjoint set of _ relations _",
    "@xmath0 , _ attributes _ @xmath1 and _ values _",
    "@xmath2 which together are the _ database elements _ @xmath3 . the function @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "gives the relation of an attribute and the attribute of a value respectively .",
    "the boolean function @xmath6 is true for attributes that are primary keys of their corresponding relations .",
    "we consider @xmath7 to be the set of _ words _ in a natural language and the set of _ phrases _ @xmath8 to be all finite non - empty word sequences .",
    "we speak of @xmath9 being @xmath10-th word of the phrase @xmath11$],@xmath12=w_i$ ] , and @xmath13 is the length of @xmath14 .",

    "assume a special function @xmath21 which stems words according to morphology of the natural language .",
    "the lexicon @xmath22 is a set of phases paired with database elements .",
    "see the bottom part of figure [ fig : db ] for an example lexicon .",

    "this corresponds to what the authors of precise call _",
    "tokenization_.      consider @xmath35 to be an injective function with image @xmath36 .",
    "this corresponds to the _ matching process _ in the precise papers where each phrase is paired uniquely with a database element .",
    "we define a binary attachment relation @xmath37 on the elements in @xmath38 which carries the attachment information on words to attachment relations on elements .",
    "formally , @xmath39    a mapping that satisfies the following additional constraints is _ valid _ :    * ( unique focus ) + @xmath40 * ( necessary value correspondences ) + @xmath41 * ( necessary attribute correspondences ) + @xmath42 * ( necessary relation correspondences ) + @xmath43[l]{\\usebox\\cbox }   \\rule[0.5\\ht\\cbox-0.5pt/2]{\\wd\\cbox}{0.5pt } } \\wedge$ ] @xmath44[l]{\\usebox\\cbox }   \\rule[0.5\\ht\\cbox-0.5pt/2]{\\wd\\cbox}{0.5pt}}$ ] @xmath45[l]{\\usebox\\cbox }   \\rule[0.5\\ht\\cbox-0.5pt/2]{\\wd\\cbox}{0.5pt}}$ ]    property 1 states that there is a distinguished attribute or relation that is the focus of the question .",
    "property 2 states that values must be paired with either an attribute ( e.g. `` ... title unforgiven ... '' ) , or via ellipsis paired with a relation ( e.g. `` ... the movie unforgiven '' ) , or , if the value is a key itself , we have a highly elliptical case where the value may stand on its own ( e.g. `` unforgiven '' ) .",
    "property 3 says that non - focus attributes must pair with a value ( e.g. in `` ... movies of year 2000 ... '' 2000 serves this role ) .",
    "property 4 was included in the precise papers , but we found it unnecessary .",
    "( semantically tractable question ) for a given question @xmath25 , lexicon @xmath46 and attachment relation @xmath47 , @xmath25 is semantically tractable if there exists a covering assignment @xmath33 over @xmath25 for which there is a valid mapping : @xmath48 and @xmath33 assigns a word in @xmath25 to @xmath49 which is compatible with @xmath50 .",
    "( unambiguous semantically tractable question ) for a given question @xmath25 , lexicon @xmath46 and attachment relation @xmath47 , @xmath25 is unambiguous semantically tractable if @xmath25 is semantically tractable and @xmath51    figure [ fig : valid ] shows three valid mappings given the schema and lexicon in figure [ fig : db ] .",
    "an additional example is `` what films did don siegal direct with lead clint eastwood ? ''",
    "this is a _ unambiguous semantically tractable question _ so long as ` don siegal ' attaches to ` direct ' and not ` lead ' , and ` clint eastwood ' attaches to ` lead ' and not ` direct ' .",
    "the precise papers say little about generating sql from sets of database elements .",
    "that said , it seems fairly straight forward .",
    "the focus element becomes the attribute ( or * in case focus is a relation ) in the sql ` select ` clause .",
    "all the involved or implied relation elements are included in the ` from ` clause .",
    "the value elements determine the simple equality conditions in the ` where ` clause . adding the join conditions is not formalized in precise , but we assume it means adding the minimal set of equality joins necessary to span all relation elements . for cyclic schemas this can lead to ambiguity . for example , while there is a unique valid mapping for the question `` what movies at the westwood '' , join paths via ` studio ` or ` shows ` are possible in the schema of figure [ fig : db ] .",
    "our java - based open - source implementation , corresponds to the formal definition of section 2 .",
    "like precise , @xmath33 assignments are computed via a brute force search and candidate valid mappings @xmath48 are solved for via reduction to graph max - flow .",
    "candidate solutions are filtered based on attachment relations obtained from the stanford parser @xcite .",
    "we generate all possible sql queries for all valid mappings .",
    "like the earlier work , we evaluated our system on geoquery .",
    "since very little information has been disclosed regarding how precise purportedly handled _ superlatives _ ( `` what is the most populous city in america ? '' ) , _ aggregation _ ( `` what is the average population of cities in ohio ? '' ) , and _ negation _ ( `` which states do not border kansas ? '' ) , we simply excluded these types of questions from our evaluation .",
    "this reduced our tests to 442 ( of 880 ) geoquery questions .    in theory ,",
    "precise could be deployed immediately on any relational database .",
    "however , we found the automatic approach to be very erratic , generating many irrelevant synonyms .",
    "part of speech - tagging ( pos ) , which can help to narrow down the senses of a word , is difficult to determine automatically from database element names .",
    "even with the correct pos identified a word might have irrelevant senses which muddle the lexicon .",
    "for example , wordnet has 26 noun senses of the word `` point '' in the geoquery attribute ` highlow.lowest_point ` , one of which has a synonym being ` state ' .",
    "hence we decided to manually add mappings to the lexicon .",
    "another reason to do this was to map relevant phrases which would not have been generated automatically otherwise .",
    "for example , to correctly answer the question `` what major rivers are in texas ? '' the phrase ` [ major river ] ` had to be associated with the relation ` river ` .    out of these 448 questions ,",
    "162 were answered correctly by our replication of precise .",
    "this does not accord to previously published recall results ( see figure [ fig : non - repeat ] ) . on the positive side , there were no questions for which precise returned a single wrong query .",
    "figure [ fig : problems ] breaks down the reasons why the 286 remaining questions for were rejected by our system : 94 questions contained no wh - word , 17 sentences contained non - stop words which the lexicon did not recognize as part of any phrase , 45 questions had at least one @xmath33 , but no @xmath48 could be found that mapped one - to - one and onto a set of elements , 41 questions had a @xmath48 that was one - to - one and onto , but no valid mapping could be found , and 89 questions produced multiple distinct solutions .",
    "a natural question is , `` did we faithfully replicate precise ? '' the description of precise was spread over two conference articles and a couple of unpublished manuscripts .",
    "a forthcoming journal article was referenced , but unfortunately it does not seem to have been published .",
    "several aspects of precise were ambiguous , contradictory or incomplete and forced us to make interpretations , which , if wrong , could have an impact on recall .",
    "still we made every effort to boost evaluation results .",
    "for example , in section 2.4 we removed condition 4 from valid mappings and added the condition in 2 . in section 2.2",
    "we added the additional stop words and wh - words to boost recall .",
    "finally we omitted certain foreign keys from the lexicon to limit needless ambiguity .",
    "we stand by the formalization presented in section 2 as a reasonable interpretation of precise , although we are open to correction .",
    "while the recall results did not replicate , at face value precision results do appear to hold up ; if one reads the questions under reasonable interpretations , all the semantically tractable questions map to what intuitively seems to be the correct sql .",
    "still one must limit this claim .",
    "consider that there is only one valid mapping for the question `` what are the titles of films directed by george lucas ? '' , however a user may be disappointed if they expect the database to also contain his student films .",
    "similar misconceptions could be present for attributes and values .",
    "this aside , our way to judge correctness is based on common sense , assuming that the user fully understands the context of the database .",
    "that said , _ the semantically tractable class does not seem to be fundamental_. we have generalized the class and nothing seems to blocks the extension of the class to questions requiring aggregation , superlatives , negation , self - joins , etc .",
    "also , the current semantically tractable class excludes questions that seem simple ( e.g. `` which films are showing in los angeles ? '' is not semantically tractable ) .",
    "future work is needed to more cleanly define and limit ` semantically tractable ' .",
    "an issue that complicates precise is the role of ambiguity .",
    "if the user asks `` what are the titles of the clint eastwood films ? '' , there are several possibilities : 1 .",
    "the films he directed ; 2 .",
    "the films he acted in ; 3 .",
    "the films he both acted and directed in ; 4 . the films he either acted or directed in . only 1 and 2",
    "are expressible in precise .",
    "still if there was a paraphrasing capability , the user could select their intended interpretation .",
    "this leads to an immediate strategy to improve practical recall. another immediate idea is to extend precise to handle ellipsis of wh - words .",
    "a more serious issue is the hidden assumptions precise makes about the form of the schema .",
    "natural language interfaces do better when the schema maintains a clear relation with a conceptual model ( e.g. entity - relationship model ) .",
    "this is the case for example we developed , but it is not completely the case for geoquery which contains tables such as ` highlow ` which have no real entity correspondence .",
    "not surprisingly many of the rejected questions in our evaluation involved this conceptually suspect table .",
    "what is needed is a more specific delineation of exactly what schemas precise is applicable over .",
    "we shall look investigate this theoretically as well as empirically , investigating for example how well precise and it generalizations cover qald@xcite and other corpora .",
    "our replication of precise made no errors in terms of returning a single , incorrect query , giving it the highest possible precision value .",
    "however , out of the 448 questions given , precise was only able to produce sql queries for 162 , giving it a recall value of 0.361 . moreover our implementation of precise requires manual lexicon configuration . still , even given this ` negative ' result",
    ", we feel that precise is a very appealing approach , but one that needs more careful scrutiny , testing and generalization .",
    "this is something we shall continue to investigate ."
