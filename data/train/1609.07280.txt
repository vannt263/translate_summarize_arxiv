    "in the last two decades , advances in laser sciences and technologies have led to the availability of intense coherent light with different characteristics .",
    "ultra - short laser pulses can be as short as a few tens of an attoseconds , leading to the new field of attosecond science @xcite .",
    "intense laser pulses of mid - infrared ( mir ) or terahertz ( thz ) frequencies have also recently become available @xcite . by employing these extreme sources of coherent light , it is possible to investigate the optical response of materials in real time with a resolution much lower than an optical cycle @xcite .",
    "the dielectric function @xmath0 is the most fundamental quantity characterizing the optical properties of matter .",
    "the dielectric function observed in an ultra - fast pump - probe experiment can be further considered as a probe time ( @xmath1)-dependent function , @xmath2 .",
    "the modulation of the dielectric function @xmath0 in the presence of electromagnetic fields has been a subject of investigation for many years .",
    "the change in the dielectric function under a static electric field is known as the franz - keldysh effect ( fke ) @xcite , and the change under an alternating electric field is known as the dynamical fke ( dfke ) @xcite .    we determined the sub - cycle change in the optical properties , i.e. , the time - resolved dfke ( tr - dfke ) , which corresponds to the response of the dressed states and quantum path interference of different dressed state @xcite .",
    "in particular , this ultra - fast change exhibits an interesting phase shift that depends on the field amplitude and probe frequency . by utilizing this phenomenon",
    ", we can develop an ultra - fast modulator of light or an ultra - fast optical switch .",
    "recently , the tr - dfke was observed experimentally by a near - infrared ( nir)-pump extreme ultraviolet ( euv)-probe with attosecond time - resolution for polycrystalline diamond @xcite .",
    "a similar effect was also observed in an excitonic state in a quantum well of gaas by a thz - pump nir - probe @xcite .",
    "we previously showed that the field amplitude of the pump laser and the bandwidth of the probe pulse are crucial parameters for controlling the tr - dfke @xcite .",
    "another possible control parameter is the polarization of the laser . in the current work ,",
    "we present analytical formulas and first - principle calculations for the tr - dfke under elliptically and circularly polarized pump lasers .",
    "the time - dependent oscillation of the optical properties decreases as the ellipticity increases .",
    "we found that the time - dependent change in the optical properties completely disappears under a circularly polarized pump laser for an isotropic band structure .",
    "we compare our formulas with first - principle calculations employing time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft ) for diamond .",

    "to derive the time - dependent conductivity , we will revisit a simple model that we reported in our previous work @xcite .",

    "we note that the conductivity @xmath4 depends on both times @xmath7 and @xmath8 rather than the just the time difference @xmath9 , owing to the presence of the pump pulse .",
    "if the probe laser is much shorter than the optical cycle of the pump laser and has peaks at time @xmath10 , we can define the time - dependent conductivity , @xmath11 , as : @xmath12    in the following , we consider a simplified description : electron dynamics in the presence of the pump and probe fields are assumed to be described by a time - dependent schrdinger equation for a single electron : @xmath13 \\psi_n(\\vec r , t ) ,   \\label{tdse}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the time - dependent wave function of the @xmath15-th band , @xmath16 is the vector potential of the pump light field , and @xmath17 is a time - independent , lattice periodic potential . in this paper , we employ atomic units for all equations .",

    "an interesting point is that the time - dependence of tr - dfke disappears for a circularly polarized laser since the summation over @xmath20 corresponds to the time - average for one @xmath20-point isotropic system .",

    "the ratio of the small oscillation between the peak and dip is approximately 10 % .",
    "there are two possible explanations for this modulation .",
    "first , the artificial error in real - time simulation is unavoidable .",
    "the tr - dfke requires high computational accuracy .",
    "therefore , small errors in time evolution and the fourier transformation affect the result .",
    "the second is the anisotropy of the band structure , which changes the definition of the reduced mass @xmath99 .",
    "although the band structure of diamond is almost isotropic around the @xmath100-point , it has a four - fold symmetric structure far from the @xmath100-point and higher energy bands .",

    "the exponential tail below the band gap , which is a feature of the fke , can be seen .",

    ", @xmath103 is approximately 0.95 ev , which corresponds to the energy at which @xmath104 $ ] has a sharp peak .",

    "the red line denotes the case of the elliptic polarization ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "the most obvious difference is the magnitude of the blue shift .",
    "the original band gap is blue - shifted by @xmath107 ev .",

    "this energy corresponds to the @xmath110 dressed state . for reference ,",

    "since the applied field amplitude is stable with circular polarization , the tunneling effect is expected to be similar to the static fke . as expected",
    ", the behavior under the band gap agrees with the case of circularly polarized light .",

    "this result indicates that the fke under circularly polarized light is not equivalent to the static fke , even though the amplitude of the electric field is static .",
