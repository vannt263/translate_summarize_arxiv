    "when a liquid is cooled fast enough below its melting point , crystallization is avoided and the system enters the supercooled phase .",
    "relaxation time increases rapidly in this temperature regime , and when it becomes comparable with the largest experimentally accessible time the system falls out of equilibrium , remaining stuck in a disordered phase called _ structural glass _ @xcite .",
    "the configurational disorder of a structural glass is not caused by the presence of intrinsic disorder in the hamiltonian , since this is just the sum of deterministic interaction elements .",
    "this notwithstanding , a lot of attention has been devoted to the phenomenological analogies between structural glasses and mean - field spin - glasses , which are systems directly containing quenched disorder in the hamiltonian in the form of random couplings among the spins @xcite . in particular ,",
    "models of spin - glasses with @xmath1-body interactions and @xmath2 , seem indeed to have many features in common with structural glasses @xcite , with the obvious ( but crucial ) difference that in mean - field systems there is a purely dynamical transition which is absent in real finite - dimensional glasses . despite the close phenomenology",
    ", however , it is natural to ask why we use models with quenched disorder to understand the behaviour of physical systems with deterministic hamiltonians .",
    "disorder , one of the characteristics of the glassy state , can not be expected to arise spontaneously from a deterministic mean - field hamiltonian , because in this case the mechanically stable configurations are ordered : the local field is the same for all spins , and thus all tend to point in the same direction .",
    "thus if we wish to stick to mean - field and the associated analytical advantages , we must resort to quenched disorder to produce glassy behaviour .",
    "the argument does not apply to finite range systems , however , and we can ask whether finite dimensional spin systems with no quenched disorder and @xmath2 display a glassy phenomenology similar to structural glasses ( we of course know that @xmath3 , i.e.  the ising model , is not glassy under many respects ) . this is a relevant question , first because it is important to understand what the key ingredients responsible for glassy dynamics are , and second because lattice spin systems are normally easier to study than off - lattice liquid models .",
    "the answer to this question seems to be affirmative .",
    "a number of spin models without quenched disorder now exist that reproduce a phenomenology similar to supercooled liquids and glasses .",
    "generally , one can say that in all these systems the non - trivial dynamic behaviour is related to the presence of frustration , due to complex even if non - disordered interaction terms in the hamiltonian . in the ss model of ref .",
    "@xcite , this is achieved by mixing nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor interactions , which gives an interesting phenomenology , although not precisely glassy . in the plaquette ( pq ) model of @xcite ,",
    "on the other hand , glassiness is achieved by a @xmath1-body interaction term with @xmath4 , in close analogy with @xmath1-spin models of mean - field spin - glasses . in the lattice glass model of @xcite frustration",
    "arises from a constraint on the numbers of neighboring particles on the lattice .",
    "the pq model has been heavily studied in recent years , and the results seem to suggest that its phenomenology has at least some points in common with structural glasses . in particular , a sufficiently rapid cooling of the pq model forms an off - equilibrium disordered phase which closely resembles real glasses .",
    "therefore , it would seem that @xmath1-body interactions in finite dimensional spin models without quenched disorder are sufficient to reproduce a phenomenology similar to supercooled liquids and glasses .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study a model in the same class as those just described , namely the deterministic version of the ctls model introduced in @xcite ( a concise description of some of our results has recently appeared in @xcite ) . as discussed below",
    ", this model has various advantages with respect to its predecessors and will enable us to check more deeply to what extent lattice spin systems can mimic structural glasses .",
    "moreover , important questions on the low temperature behaviour of glasses , such as the stability of the supercooled phase and the role of the crystal , can be addressed , whereas in previous models such an analysis was very limited .",
    "let us now explain why .",
    "liquids in nature have a crystalline ground state , usually with low degeneracy , and display a first order thermodynamic transition at the melting temperature . in the pq model in three dimensions a first order transition takes place , but the ` crystalline ' ground state has an unusual property for liquids , in that it is strongly degenerate : for linear size @xmath5 , the pq model has @xmath6 different ground states with the same energy .",
    "the problem is not the degeneracy in itself ( note that the ground state entropy density is zero ) , but rather the consequences that this degeneracy has on the possibility to measure the degree of order in the system .",
    "more precisely , in the pq model , given a ground state configuration ( for example the ferromagnetic one ) , we can obtain another ground state by flipping any plane of spins .",
    "clearly , by iterating this procedure we can produce ground state configurations which look highly disordered , despite all having the ground state energy .",
    "the problem then is how to distinguish a truly disordered , or glassy , configuration , from a configuration made up of many droplets of different ground states .",
    "the energy of both configurations will be high , in the first case because it is essentially a liquid , in the second case because of the interfaces among different droplets .",
    "in other words , energy is not a sufficiently precise measure of order in the pq model , and due to the strong ground state degeneracy no configurational means can be devised to quantify order and domain growth .",
    "the system we introduce here does not suffer from this problem : it has a doubly degenerate ground state , such that it is possible to measure the amount of crystalline order and to monitor domain growth .",
    "a likely objection is that glassy physics does not have anything to do with the crystal , and that the possibility to measure the formation and growth of crystal domains is far from essential to study the physics of glasses .",
    "we reply to this objection with two observations .",
    "first , that simple glass formers usually _ do have _ a crystalline phase , whose possible connection with the properties of the glass can not be completely ruled out in principle .",
    "in fact , our model explicitly shows such a connection .",
    "secondly , if on the other hand spin models with a crystal phase fail somehow to reproduce some basic property of glasses , then we should understand why , and make sure that all spin models are free from this problem .",
    "indeed , the precise nature of what is normally called the glassy phase in systems like pq @xcite and in lattice glass models @xcite is the main focus of our work .",
    "our model shows , in this respect , an interesting phenomenology . as we will show",
    ", it has a first order liquid - solid transition at a melting temperature @xmath7 .",
    "crystallization can be avoided by fast cooling , and a supercooled liquid phase , metastable with respect to the crystal , is found .",
    "`` equilibrium '' measurements can be performed as long as the equilibration time of the supercooled liquid is much shorter than the nucleation time of the crystal . in this phase",
    "the behaviour of our system is very similar to real supercooled liquids , and in particular to fragile systems .",
    "however , a temperature @xmath0 exists , where the crystal nucleation time becomes of the same order as the liquid equilibration time : at this point the supercooled liquid looses stability and it no longer exists below @xmath0 .",
    "we call @xmath0 the _ effective spinodal _ temperature .",
    "it is important to stress the following fact : we are able to detect the loss of stability of the liquid only because the equilibration time at @xmath0 , @xmath8 , is shorter than our longest experimental time .",
    "we can state this point in a different way .",
    "a system falls out of equilibrium when the relaxation time becomes too large for the ( real / numerical ) experiments , and this is the operational definition of the glass transition temperature @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the reason why we can observe the loss of stability of the supercooled liquid in our model is that @xmath10 .",
    "the kauzmann paradox ( i.e.  the fact that the extrapolated liquid entropy becomes smaller than the crystal entropy at a finite temperature ) is avoided by this loss of stability : no equilibrium supercooled liquid exists below @xmath0 and the entropy extrapolation is meaningless .",
    "in fact , this is the scenario proposed by kauzmann himself @xcite as solution of the paradox , which is thus exactly reproduced in this system . below @xmath0",
    "the system enters a completely different phase , where crystal nucleation and crystalline domain growth are the main dynamic processes .",
    "however , by quenching to lower temperatures the growth of crystalline order becomes so slow that it is impossible to distinguish this phase from a typical off - equilibrium realistic glass .",
    "moreover , we shall show that dynamical measurements of the fluctuation - dissipation ( fd ) ratio are compatible with the results obtained in ordinary structural glasses below @xmath9 .",
    "it is our impression that the scenario described above is also shared by the pq , and possibly other spin models .",
    "in particular , that what is normally called the glassy phase for the pq model is an off - equilibrium regime of very slow crystal growth .",
    "however , as already mentioned , without a direct measure of crystalline order it is hard to assess the amount of order in the pq model , so the question whether there is in fact a glassy phase qualitatively different from the crystal growth phase below @xmath0 is open .",
    "this is certainly not the case in the present model , though .    throughout the paper",
    "we will use a notation common to supercooled liquids and glasses .",
    "we call @xmath7 the melting temperature . in analogy with mode coupling theory @xcite",
    ", @xmath11 will be the temperature where a power law fit locates a divergence of the relaxation time , while @xmath12 will be the temperature where a vogel - fulchner - tamman fit puts the same divergence .",
    "the so - called kauzmann temperature , i.e. the temperature where the extrapolated liquid entropy becomes equal to the crystal entropy , is called @xmath13 . the effective spinodal temperature , i.e.  the temperature below which it becomes impossible to observe the metastable liquid",
    "is called @xmath0 .",
    "this temperature is called @xmath9 in @xcite , but we reject this choice because , as already mentioned , in the liquid literature the glass transition is defined rather as the point where the equilibration time is longer than the experimental time .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce our model , and describe the properties of the crystalline ground state . in section iii",
    "we show , by comparing the liquid and crystal free energies , that the model has a first order phase transition at a melting temperature @xmath7 .",
    "the dynamics of the supercooled liquid below @xmath7 and the metastability limit @xmath0 are considered in section iv , while aging dynamics and its relation to domain growth are studied in section v. finally , we draw our conclusions in section vi .",
    "the model is described by the hamiltonian @xmath14 where the variables @xmath15 are ising spins belonging to a two - dimensional square lattice of side @xmath5 , and the plaquette variable @xmath16 is the product of the four nearest neighbors of spin @xmath17 : @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is for west , @xmath20 for south and so on ) .",
    "the model is studied by metropolis monte carlo simulations with single - spin - flip dynamics for lattices of size @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "a disordered version of this model was first introduced in ref.@xcite , as a way to model two - level systems in a lattice , interacting with their nearest neighbors , whence its name ctls ( coupled two level systems ) .",
    "in fact , one can take the spin @xmath23 to be the variable describing the state of a two - level system sitting at site @xmath17 .",
    "then state @xmath24 has always zero energy , while the other state can be at 1 or -1 depending on the factor @xmath16 .",
    "thus when one of the neighbors switches , the relative height of the two states at @xmath17 is reversed . in @xcite , however , quenched random coupling constants where considered .",
    "here we shall see that the multi - body nature of the interaction is sufficient to give a non - trivial dynamic and static behaviour .",
    ", 0.2 truecm    frustration in the ctls comes from the fact that it is not possible to satisfy simultaneously the 4-spin and the 5-spin interaction . after careful inspection of the hamiltonian it is found that the ground state of the ctls is obtained by covering the lattice with the following non - overlapping elements : @xmath25 as fig .",
    "[ ground - state ] shows , the covering can be done in two ways , giving rise to two different ground states which we call dextrocrystal and levocrystal .",
    "these two crystals are connected by the symmetry @xmath26 , or @xmath27 , while they are both invariant under @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , the ctls has a crystalline ground state , with energy density @xmath29 . in fig .",
    "[ ground - state ] it can be seen that the crystal can be obtained by periodic repetition of a @xmath30 unit cell .",
    "apart from the two distinct dextro- and levo- forms , additional crystals can be formed by translating the unit cell up to @xmath31 lattice spacings in each direction .",
    "there are then different ways to cover the lattice , which are not locally compatible with each other . upon a quench",
    ", the system will greedily optimize the energy locally in an uncoordinated way , creating many different competing domains with boundaries that turn out to be pinned , thus giving rise to slow dynamics .",
    "as already anticipated , the low degeneracy of the crystalline ground state is one of the main advantages of the ctls compared to other plaquette models @xcite . indeed , as we shall see , in the ctls it is possible to quantify the amount of crystalline order in the system by purely configurational means , irrespective of the value of the energy .",
    "this is particularly useful when we are studying the growth of crystalline domains , because in this case the energy may be very large , due to interfaces , even though there is a substantial amount of crystalline order .",
    "moreover , the low degeneracy of the crystal makes this model more similar to real liquids .",
    "in the present section we will show that the ctls has a first order phase transition at a melting temperature @xmath7 . to prove this fact we start from the numerical observation that in a certain interval of temperature both the crystalline phase obtained by heating the ground state and the liquid phase obtained by cooling a high temperature configuration are stable up to times of order @xmath32 montecarlo steps ( mcs ) , for @xmath21 . in fig .",
    "[ metastability ] we plot the equilibrium internal energy as a function of the temperature for the crystal and the liquid phases .",
    "= 3.5 in 0.2 truecm    in order to find @xmath7 we need to compute the free energy in the two phases by integration of the internal energy .",
    "to this aim , we fit the liquid energy ( lq ) as @xmath33 while for the crystal ( cr ) we find @xmath34 by using the thermodynamic formula , @xmath35 we obtain the free energy of the liquid and crystal phases : @xmath36 where we have taken @xmath37 for the liquid , and @xmath38 for the crystal .",
    "the melting temperature is fixed by requiring @xmath39 , which gives @xmath40 we have checked that our energy data are independent of system size for @xmath41 .    in order to check that a first order liquid - crystal transition actually takes place at @xmath7 we proceed as in @xcite : we consider an initial condition where half of the system is in the crystal phase and half in a random phase , and we run this configuration at @xmath42 and at @xmath43 .",
    "if our determination of @xmath7 is correct , after a transient time the system should relax either to the liquid or crystalline phase , since the stable phase will expand and take over the whole system after a sufficiently long time . the time evolution of the energy is shown in fig .",
    "[ meta - ene ] , confirming our previous determination of @xmath7 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the ctls has a first order thermodynamic phase transition at @xmath44 .    even though the energy of a configuration may be considered as an index of the degree of crystallization of the system , it is certainly not a very sensitive one .",
    "given that we know the crystal in this system , and thanks to its low degeneracy , we introduce some methods to directly quantify the amount of crystalline order in our samples .",
    "this can be done either by measuring the typical crystal droplet size @xmath45 , or by measuring the total crystal mass @xmath46 . to measure @xmath45",
    "we observe that both crystals have a periodic structure with a unit cell of size @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the fourier transform of the spatial correlation function , @xmath47 has a peak at @xmath48 .",
    "the width @xmath49 of this peak is proportional to the inverse of the typical crystalline domain size .",
    "we want to extract from @xmath49 a measure of how large is the typical crystal domain , a question which is better answered by comparing it to the system size .",
    "so we actually define @xmath45 as a density , i.e. @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "it is important to note that this definition of @xmath45 has a limited power of resolution : in a random configuration we find on average that @xmath51 , which can therefore be considered as the effective zero for @xmath45 .",
    "when we think of a configuration entirely made up of tiny mismatched crystallites we realize that @xmath45 is not enough as a measure of crystal order : in this case @xmath45 would be very small , even though the total amount of crystal would be large .",
    "the crystalline mass @xmath46 can be measured by counting the fraction of crystallized spins .",
    "to this aim , we have to define an elementary unit , which is large enough to have a small probability to be formed randomly , but small enough to be sensitive to small amounts of crystal .",
    "we choose the nine - spin unit shown in fig .  [",
    "ground - state](right ) : in the pure crystal each minus spin is surrounded by eight pluses , and in the unit cell we have 5 of these elements ( which clearly overlap ) . to count all the spins in the cell we must multiply the number of these units by 5 .",
    "thus , we define the crystal mass density @xmath52 $ ] as the number of these elementary units times @xmath31 normalized by @xmath53 . as for @xmath45",
    ", we have a random average value of the mass , @xmath54 , which is the effective zero of @xmath46 .",
    "had we chosen the @xmath30 unit cell , the accuracy would be higher , but the sensitivity would decrease as well . in order to test the definition of @xmath45 and @xmath46",
    ", we measure their time evolution in the experiment described above for the determination of @xmath7 .",
    "this results are shown in fig .",
    "[ meta - xi ] and fig .",
    "[ meta - mass ] .",
    "note that in the liquid phase at @xmath55 we have @xmath56 ( whereas @xmath45 is compatible with zero ) , meaning that also in the liquid above @xmath7 there is a certain amount of short range order . from this experiment",
    "we see that both these quantities are excellent configurational indicators of the amount of crystalline order in the system .",
    "we finish this section by noting that if we extrapolate @xmath57 and @xmath58 to low temperatures , we can find the temperature @xmath13 where the entropy of the supercooled liquid becomes equal to the entropy of the crystal ( which , in this temperature range , is to a very good degree of approximation equal to zero ) .",
    "we find @xmath59 therefore , @xmath13 is the temperature where the kauzmann paradox occurs @xcite : below @xmath13 the supercooled liquid entropy would become smaller than that of the crystal , that is , quite unacceptably , smaller than zero .",
    "this temperature is usually called kauzmann temperature in the literature , a denomination we find somewhat unsatisfactory given that kauzmann himself did not believe the extrapolation was really meaningful .",

    "the aim of this section is to study the dynamical behaviour of the ctls in the supercooled liquid phase ( i.e.  for @xmath60 ) and in particular to analyze how the relaxation time increases when decreasing the temperature .",
    "as already anticipated in the introduction , there is a marked difference in the behaviour of the system if our observational time window is longer or shorter than a given time @xmath61 mcs . for @xmath62 the supercooled",
    "liquid is stable at all temperatures where equilibration may be achieved : in this time regime we can either study the equilibrium supercooled liquid or the off - equilibrium glass , formed by a sufficiently fast cooling . on the other hand ,",
    "if we are able to observe the dynamics on time scales @xmath63 we discover that the supercooled liquid loses stability at low enough temperatures , and the system enters a completely different regime .",
    "therefore , it is useful to divide our dynamical investigation into two parts : first we shall assume that our maximum experimental time @xmath64 is shorter than @xmath65 and we will measure the equilibrium properties of the supercooled liquid .",
    "second , we will consider times larger than @xmath66 , to analyze the loss of stability of the supercooled liquid .",

    "are so small that they are not even well defined , in the sense that their linear size @xmath225 is of the same order as the width @xmath226 of the interfaces ( or domain walls ) among them . in this regime",
    "the excess energy is dominated by the regions not yet crystallized , and the interfacial and domain contributions are of the same order . for longer times , the largest part of the system is crystallized , so the mass @xmath46 saturates , and the small domains start growing one at the expenses of each other .    = 3.5 in 0.2 truecm    = 3.5 in 0.2 truecm    therefore a proper _ coarsening _ regime starts with a clearly increasing @xmath45 , and @xmath227 . now domains are well defined and the excess energy is concentrated in the interfaces .",
    "these are now much thinner than the domain size and can be considered as lower dimensional manifolds .",
    "this must give , @xmath228 as in standard coarsening@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ domain - m - xi ] we plot the excess energy @xmath229 vs.  @xmath45 for a number of temperatures and times .",
    "consistently with our conclusions , for shorter times there is a drop in energy with basically no increase in @xmath45 . on the other hand , for @xmath230",
    "the @xmath231 law fits reasonably well the data , suggesting that this is the late - time coarsening regime .",
    "note that @xmath230 implies @xmath232 ( see fig .",
    "[ domain - m - xi ] ) .",
    "we could thus schematically say that the coarsening regime sets in when the total crystal mass exceeds @xmath233 .",
    "this definition of the two regimes is consistent with the behaviour displayed by @xmath234 : for @xmath235 the system enters the coarsening regime ( i.e. @xmath232 and @xmath230 ) for @xmath236 ( see fig .",
    "[ mass - xi ] ) , precisely on the same time scale the energy ( fig .",
    "[ fit - ene ] ) passes from a power law behaviour with low exponent to a faster @xmath202 behaviour . for @xmath194 on the other hand @xmath237 for our longest time , and",
    "correspondingly the energy always obeys a slow power law decay .",
    "we now focus on the behaviour of two - time quantities , for quenches below @xmath7 . in equilibrium dynamics , correlation functions @xmath238 and their associated response functions @xmath239 ,",
    "( @xmath119 is a generic variable and @xmath240 is the field conjugate to it ) depend only on the difference @xmath241 .",
    "this is not the case when the system is out of equilibrium .",
    "the aging regime is that in which one - time quantities ( such as energy or density ) are stationary or change very little , but two - time quantities depend explicitly on both times @xmath242 @xcite .",
    "an important quantity which allows to distinguish among different kinds of aging behaviour @xcite is the fluctuation - dissipation ( fd ) ratio , @xmath243 in equilibrium , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) states that @xmath244 , while out of equilibrium the fdt is violated and @xmath245 depends on @xmath246 in a non trivial way .",
    "it has been conjectured @xcite that during aging @xmath245 depends on time only through the correlation function , conjecture that has proved valid in all systems studied to date .",
    "if one considers the susceptibility , or integrated response , @xmath247 which is much easier to compute numerically , then assuming @xmath248 $ ] one finds from ( [ fdr ] ) @xmath249 therefore one can plot @xmath250 vs.  @xmath251 at fixed @xmath72 , and extract @xmath245 from the slope of the curve . in equilibrium @xmath244 and",
    "the curve is a straight line @xmath252 $ ] , with slope @xmath253 . for a system out of equilibrium one",
    "finds in general two regimes : a short time quasi - equilibrium regime ( @xmath254 ) , corresponding to equilibration of fast degrees of freedom , where the curve follows the equilibrium straight line and fdt holds ; and the aging regime at larger times ( @xmath254 ) where @xmath255 departs from the equilibrium line . in particular , for structural glass models studied so far via numerical simulations @xcite it has been found that after leaving the equilibrium line , the curves follows another straight line , with smaller ( in absolute value ) slope .    to study the fd relations in ctls we follow ( as has been done before in other spin systems @xcite ) the evolution of the staggered magnetization ( @xmath256 are quenched random variables ) , @xmath257 when adding a term @xmath258 to the hamiltonian .",
    "if the field @xmath240 is applied at time @xmath72 , the @xmath259-averaged susceptibility @xmath260 is related to the spin - spin correlation function : @xmath261 we have used fields @xmath262 and @xmath263 , and checked that they are within the linear regime .",
    "the results presented here correspond to the highest field .",
    "we look for aging behavior in the regions @xmath264 and @xmath265 . as we have seen , in both these regions the system has trouble equilibrating , though for different reasons .",
    "we first quench the system to @xmath98 , which is above the spinodal , and plot @xmath266 vs.  @xmath267 for different waiting times ( fig .",
    "[ fdt1 ] ) . except perhaps for the shortest @xmath72",
    ", the curve obeys the fdt : we obtain a straight line with slope @xmath268 , independent of @xmath72 .",
    "no aging is observed , and the behavior is compatible with a system in equilibrium , except that we know from thermodynamics that the equilibrium phase at this temperature is the crystal : we are witnessing the _ metastable liquid , _ which at this temperature lasts much longer than its relaxation time , and can thus be observed .    on the other hand , a quench to @xmath269 shows aging very clearly , as the correlation function plotted for different waiting times shows ( fig .",
    "[ fdt2 ] ) . the fd ratio ( fig .",
    "[ fdt3 ] ) also shows very clearly that the system is out of equilibrium .",
    "in fact , we know that the liquid is unstable at this temperature , and that the crystal phase is growing . in a system undergoing coarsening , like the ising model quenched below @xmath11 , the susceptibility rapidly saturates at the value corresponding to the low - temperature phase , because the contribution of the interfaces is negligible .",
    "the correlation function , however , continues to drop because of the movement of the domain walls .",
    "thus the fd curve is flat for small values of the correlation function @xcite .",
    "we would expect this same behavior whenever the dynamics is given by growing domains with bulk equilibrium properties , separated by sharp interfaces .",
    "however , the fd curve does not become flat in the ctls at @xmath194 , even for our longer waiting times .",
    "instead , the system shows fdt violations similar to those commonly exhibited by structural glass models @xcite and certain mean field spin - glasses ( solved by a one step replica broken solution , 1-step rsb ) @xcite .",
    "there are two regimes : a quasi equilibrium one with slope @xmath270 and an off - equilibrium one with slope @xmath271 .",
    "note that the fd curves hardly depend on @xmath72 , at least for the times the simulations can reach .",
    "= 3.5 in 0.2 truecm    = 3.5 in 0.2 truecm    taken at face value , this result would lead to interpret this as an out - of - equilibrium glassy phase ( i.e.  a liquid with weakly - broken ergodicity ) . to understand it correctly",
    "however we need to recall the discussion of the previous section .",
    "we have seen that at low temperatures ( @xmath188 ) the crystal growth dynamics proceeds through two qualitatively different time regimes . in the first bubbling regime disordered regions",
    "separates small crystal domains and the interfacial contribution to the susceptibility is still very large .",
    "the coarsening regime , where the dynamics is dominated by the nucleated regions and the interfacial contribution can be neglected , will only be reached later , when the crystal regions have grown enough to overwhelm the interfaces .",
    "due to the extremely slow activated dynamics the bubbling regime can last for long , and indeed at very low temperatures it is the only one accessible in our simulation times .",
    "if this is the case , we do not expect to see in the response - correlation relation the fdt violations typical of coarsening systems , since the coarsening regime has not yet been attained .",
    "this is exactly what happens for @xmath194 : we can check that the crystal mass for the longest time explored in fig .",
    "[ fdt3 ] is @xmath272 ( fig .",
    "[ mass - xi]-right ) , well below the value @xmath273 that characterizes the crossover to the coarsening regime .",
    "the 1-rsb - like fdt violation observed at @xmath194 thus occurs in the bubbling regime , while if we could wait longer times we would observe a crossover to typical a coarsening behaviour .    0.5 cm    = 3.5 in 0.2 truecm    since the duration of the bubbling regime is shorter for higher temperatures",
    ", we expect to explicitly observe an fdt crossover to the coarsening regime at higher temperatures . from the former sections we know that at @xmath274 the crossover from the bubbling to the coarsening regime takes place at about @xmath275 mcs . in fig .",
    "[ fdt4 ] we plot the fd curves for @xmath274 , and the data confirm our expectations . for short waiting times , the curves initially follow what seems to be the path of a 1-rsb - like violation . this is the bubbling phase , pretending to be a glass .",
    "the curves depend strongly on waiting time , and for higher @xmath72 evolve toward the normal domain - growth curve ( two straight lines , with slope @xmath270 at short times and 0 at long times ) , which is nearly reached for @xmath276mcs",
    ".    0.5 cm    = 3.5 in 0.2 truecm",
    "we have presented a lattice model , the deterministic ctls , which exhibits a phenomenology typical of glass forming systems : it has a melting transition and a low temperature crystalline ground state , but it exists as a supercooled liquid for a wide range of temperatures ; in the metastable supercooled phase the relaxation time increases in a way resemblant of typical fragile glasses and upon fast cooling crystallization can be easily avoided to bring the system in disordered glassy - like states .",
    "the feature that makes this model particularly interesting is that it displays a metastability limit which can be explicitly observed within the time scales available for numerical simulations .",
    "what we have shown is that the typical phenomenology of fragile glass forming systems is entirely compatible with the existence of a metastability limit of the supercooled phase , even if it is plausible that , contrarily to the ctls , for many models this limit can not be observed . a crucial point in this regard",
    "concerns the length of experimental times under which measurements are performed . by definition the supercooled liquid looses stability at @xmath0 , when crystal nucleation becomes faster than liquid equilibration . if the equilibration time at @xmath0 is much larger than the experimental time , however , the metastability limit can not be observed .",
    "since the glass temperature @xmath9 is the lowest temperature at which the system is equilibrated within the experimental time , this situation takes place when @xmath277 .",
    "if the system has a metastability limit , below the pseudospinodal @xmath0 the dynamical behaviour basically consists of very slow crystal growth .",
    "this suggests some criteria to detect whether a system has such a metastability limit or not , even when @xmath162 is experimentally inaccessible .",
    "for example , one would _ a priori _ think that there is a qualitative difference between a disordered glassy configuration , obtained by quenching a liquid , and a crystalline configuration , however rich in defects this is , and however slow crystal growth may be . also , since off - equilibrium dynamics of simple domain growth has very peculiar characteristics one would hope to detect crystal growth by analyzing the dynamical behaviour of the system , and in particular the pattern of fdt violations .",
    "what we have shown in the ctls is that actually neither of these criteria is sharp enough , and if our experimental time were not long enough to _ explicitly _ observe the loss of stability of the liquid at @xmath162 , it would be impossible to make statements about it , either by structural or dynamical means .",
    "on the other hand , on shorter time scales the system exhibits an off - equilibrium behaviour which is typical of structural fragile glasses .",
    "indeed , we have seen that there is a long time regime where fdt violations are 1-rsb like , as in most of fragile glass models studied so far , while the proper coarsening regime is attained only at much larger times .",
    "also , there is structural continuity between the low - temperature configurations reached via fast coolings and those approached with slower cooling rates , which means that the degree of order in the system increases gradually : what appears as a disordered glassy like configuration is just the beginning of a continuous process that eventually , on much longer time scales , leads to the crystal .",
    "the reason for this behaviour is that below @xmath162 crystal nucleation is fast , but crystal growth becomes very slow , with many crystal droplets trying to expand in a liquid background .",
    "in such a situation distinguishing between a truly disordered glass and a mixture of tiny mismatched crystallites becomes very hard , and fdt violation is nontrivial .",
    "an important consequence of the metastability limit scenario in the ctls is that the kauzmann paradox is avoided : below @xmath0 the liquid does not exist in any reasonable sense , thus extrapolation of the excess entropy is meaningless .",
    "this was the resolution of the paradox proposed by kauzmann himself in his paper .",
    "while we can not claim that this is the case for real glasses , ( and we have discussed qualitative alternative scenarios in terms of crystal nucleation and growth ) , this system shows that kauzmann s way out of the kauzmann paradox ought to be considered seriously . in the study of glassy systems the crystal phase is often neglected , assuming that if crystallization is avoided at @xmath7 , then the crystal does not play any role in the low temperature physics .",
    "what this model shows is that the stability of the supercooled liquid should not be taken for granted .",
    "finally , even if stability were to be proved not to be a concern in real systems , this remains a cautionary note when formulating non - disordered glass models , especially on the lattice , which is so attractive .",
    "one can also wonder if these considerations might be applicable to disordered systems , or systems with complex ( highly degenerate ) low - temperature phases , were the supercooled liquid could be unstable with respect to a crystal in disguise .",
