    "research on electron- and photon - molecule collision dynamics is of both fundamental  @xcite and practical  @xcite importance , for it is needed in a broad variety of applications , ranging from the manufacturing of semiconductor devices to atmospheric chemistry and physics .",
    "theoretical studies are therefore needed not only for a fundamental understanding of the underlying dynamics , but also for the quantitative prediction of the appropriate data .    following the pioneering work of sanche and co - workers  @xcite , electron interactions with biologically important molecules such as amino acids and nucleotides , have gained prominence , as it was convincingly suggested that resonant mechanisms induced by non - thermal low - energy electrons could be related to dna and rna lesions such as single strand breaks ( ssbs ) and double strand breaks ( dsbs )  @xcite .",
    "thus , the suggestion that metastable electron capture of the large amount of non - thermal secondary electrons produced upon the interaction of ionizing radiation with the cell environment  @xcite by the various dna components could initiate the formation of ssbs and dsbs , stimulated a wealth of experimental work on electron collisions with gaseous  @xcite and thin films dna and rna bases  @xcite .",
    "recently theoretical studies have also given a better understanding of these insights  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the notion of charge transfer and of electron flow along the @xmath0 stack of nucleobases would benefit from the detailed knowledge of the response of the nucleotide moieties to excess negative charge  @xcite .",
    "thus , the capability to stabilize an excess of charge in the nucleobases has been extensively investigated in recent years both experimentally and theoretically , ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) where electron attachment energies to several nucleobases including the title molecule where evaluated for the formation of both dipole- and valence - bound anions .    at variance with this promising and stimulating scenario , much less attention",
    "have been paid to the study of photoionization dynamics .",
    "in fact , even if the first measurement of the ionization potential ( ip ) of uracil dates back to the late sixties  @xcite and since then uv and x - ray photoelectron spectra were measured and interpreted by a large number of investigators ( see for example ,  @xcite , and references therein ) none of these studies focused on the dynamical part of the photoionization process , namely , on the dependence of the intensity of the process on the incident photon energy ( or , equivalently on the photoelectron kinetic energy ) and on the photoelectron ejection angle for a given final target state . the first five bands of the photoelectron spectra have been unambiguously assigned and associated with the three highest occupied @xmath0 and the two ( oxygen lone - pairs ) nonbonding orbitals ( @xmath1 ) , the ordering being @xmath2 from the top of the photoelectron spectrum respectively  @xcite , and the experimental ordering has been verified by theoretical semi - empirical and _ ab - initio _ ci calculations  @xcite and is being confirmed by the present work as well as we shall discuss below .",
    "high accurate gas phase ionization energies of uracil , obtained by using electron - propagator methods have been published  @xcite and ionization energy thresholds in aqueous solutions have been discussed in even earlier work  @xcite .",
    "the close connection between shape - resonances in electron - molecule scattering and those in molecular photoionization has long been recognized  @xcite .",
    "in fact , although the long - range part of the scattering potential is drastically different in the two cases , the short - range part , is actually quite similar , being dominated by the interactions between the nuclei and the electrons common to both collision complexes .",
    "therefore , since shape - resonant states are localized within the molecular volume , these should maintain their identity from one system to the other , although shifted in energy owing to the less effective screening in the scattering potential of the neutral molecule compared to that for the positive ion target . as a rule of thumb , therefore , photoionization shape resonances should have their counterparts in electron - molecule scattering experiments , albeit shifted by @xmath3 ev to higher electron energy  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present study is to characterize , for the first time at the dft level , both the outer valence and inner - shell photoionization dynamics of the uracil molecule in a broad energy range , from threshold up to 100 ev of photoelectron kinetic energy .",
    "the method we use is essentially a one - electron method , thus we are unable to explicitly account for the variety of many - body effects inherently displayed in the complexity of electron- and photon - molecule collisions both at low and high energies  @xcite , but it has consistently afforded a realistic description of one - electron resonant processes ( for a review see ref .",
    "further , its lcao version  @xcite is applicable to fairly large molecular systems with a markedly lower computational cost when compared to earlier , realistic independent - electron _ ab - initio _ methods  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the next two sections describe our theoretical method and the computational details . in section",
    "iv we will discuss our results for the core- and outer - valence ionizations .",
    "our conclusions and perspectives are then summarized in the final section .",
    "dynamical quantities describing the photoionization process from uracil are calculated in the framework of the dft approach , by employing a fortan90 suite of codes fully described in earlier publications  @xcite so we only sketch here their salient features .",
    "the present formulation affords a one - electron picture of the scattering process , thereby casting the collisional problem as given via the use of an effective potential according to the kohn - sham scheme  @xcite .",
    "the escaping electron is deflected by such a potential containing the molecular ground state density , @xmath4 , and conventionally separated into direct ( hartree ) , @xmath5 and exchange - correlation , @xmath6 terms :    @xmath7    with    @xmath8\\ ] ]    the interaction potential is then expanded in a composite basis set , whose nature constitute the key - feature of the present lcao approach  @xcite .",
    "the lcao basis set consists in a large single center expansion ( sce ) located at a chosen origin ( usually the center of mass of the molecule )    @xmath9    and supplemented by functions of the same type , located on the off - center arbitrary positions  @xmath10    @xmath11    in equation  ( [ eq4 ] ) , index @xmath12 runs over the non - equivalent nuclei , @xmath10 runs over the set of equivalent nuclei , @xmath13 , and gives the origin of the off - center spherical coordinates @xmath14 .",
    "the sets of coefficients @xmath15 and @xmath16 define the unitary transformations between real spherical harmonics @xmath17 and the symmetry adapted angular basis sets  @xcite which transform as the _ _ @xmath18__th element of the _ _ p__th irreducible representation ( ir ) of the molecular point group .",

    "the ground state electron density of uracil at the experimental equilibrium geometry  @xcite for its diketo form  @xcite and assuming a @xmath32 symmetry , was calculated with the adf package  @xcite employing an all - electron double-@xmath33 plus polarization ( dzp ) basis set of slater - type orbitals , taken from the adf database .",

    "the lb94 @xmath35 potential @xcite has been used because of its correct asymptotic behavior @xcite .",

    "extending up to @xmath39 a.u .. the intervals were supplemented with additional knots near the position of the nuclei in order to gain flexibility of the basis set in the region of the core orbitals .",
    "the maximum angular momenta @xmath40 employed in the off - center expansions were @xmath41 and @xmath42 for the hydrogens and the heavier atoms respectively , whereas carefully selected values for @xmath25 defining the off - center radial grids range from 0.75 a.u .",

    "( oxygen sites ) .",
    "valence ip s of uracil where also evaluated with the adf program by using the slater s transition - state approximation  @xcite , a slater - type basis set of triple-@xmath33 plus polarization ( tzp ) quality and the becke - perdew  @xcite  _ xc _ potential .",
    "in this section we will present and discuss photoionization cross sections and asymmetry parameters profiles calculated with the lcao dft scattering code for selected orbital ionizations . specifically the k",
    "@xmath43 ionizations of oxygen nitrogen and carbon atoms , and the outer - valence ionizations giving rise to the first five resolved bands of the photoelectron spectrum  @xcite .",
    "although results have been obtained also for inner - valence orbital ionizations we will not attempt to discuss and rationalize them here , since single - electron approximation based theories are well - known to loose of their predictive power in the inner - valence region of the spectrum .",
    "( magari mettere su un documento epaps ? ) figure  [ fig.1 ] reports the chemical structure of uracil and the numbering scheme adopted in the present work , while the experimental ips  @xcite are reported in table i , together with theoretical values taken from the literature  @xcite , and results of dft bound - state calculations using two different _ xc _ potentials and ground - state ( core ionizations ) or transition - state ( valence ionizations ) configurations . focusing on the core ip s , fair agreement is found between experimental  @xcite and ground - state lb94 ip s , the latter being systematically overestimating the core ip s energies by as much as @xmath44 evs . nonetheless , the lb94 ground - state calculations are able to account for the small differences among the various c @xmath43 ip s , in other words the chemical shifts of carbon atoms are nicely reproduced , as usually found when applying dft to core ionizations of large molecules ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . the observed trend in the chemical shifts",
    "is readily rationalized by considering the bond connectivity of the carbon atoms , in particular with the more electronegative nitrogen and oxygen centers .",
    "these results once more underline the peculiarity of core ionization studies to provide qualitative informations of both electronic and structural type , pertaining to the different sites probed by core ionization .",
    "for the five outermost valence ip s there is a broad agreement between theoretical results and experimental data : use of the becke - perdew  @xcite _ xc _ potential and the transition - state procedure with a tzp basis set has allowed to account fairly well of relaxation and correlation effects , giving results of comparable quality of those obtained with the p@xmath45 _ ab - initio _",
    "procedure  @xcite .",
    "the lcao - dft partial cross section and asymmetry parameter profiles for the core ionizations , oxygen @xmath43 ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ionizations ) , nitrogen @xmath43 ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ionizations ) and carbon @xmath43 ( @xmath50 through @xmath51 ionizations ) , are plotted in figure  [ fig.2 ] and figure  [ fig.3 ] respectively .",
    "the dynamical observables are plotted on the photoelectron kinetic energy scale because it will prove convenient for the purpose of identifying striking similarities in the scattering dynamics for the various final ionic states .",
    "one readily sees that the two oxygen @xmath43 ionization cross sections behave similarly , due to nearly identical initial states ( upper left frame of fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] ) .",
    "the same is true for the nitrogen @xmath43 ionizations ( upper right frame of figure  [ fig.2 ] ) .",
    "three low - energy shape - resonances are clearly discernible in the o @xmath43 ionization channels , a more intense one centered at about @xmath52 ev of photoelectron kinetic energy , located in between two less intense features and superimposed on a strong background .",
    "a sharper prominent resonance characterize the low - energy scattering dynamics following the n @xmath43 ionizations , with a peak energy of about @xmath53 ev .",
    "the resonant peak shows up more clearly in the n@xmath54 @xmath55 continua , rather than in the n@xmath56 one , where the cross section is more structured toward threshold . in the lower frames of fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] we have reported the cross section profiles for the four c @xmath55 ionizations .",
    "these are conveniently plotted in two separate groups , according to the similarities or differences shared in their near - threshold behavior .",
    "thus one can easily find marked analogies in the @xmath50 and @xmath57 partial cross sections over the whole electron kinetic energy range : both display a fairly strong resonant peak at about @xmath58 ev and a weaker one at about @xmath59 ev , after which the two profiles can be nearly superimposed on the scale of the figure .",
    "the cross section profiles for the @xmath60 and @xmath51 orbital ionizations behave quite similarly , even if two separate features at @xmath61 and @xmath59 ev in the @xmath60 continua eventually coalesce into a single broad peak in the @xmath51 continua , and the two cross section profiles behave markedly different when approaching threshold .",
    "it is worth noting that all core ionization cross sections show a broad hump at about 35 ev of photoelectron kinetic energy , a feature which should be connected with inefficient trapping of the photoelectron by high-@xmath62 partial waves of the one - particle effective scattering potential .",
    "asymmetry parameter profiles , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] , behave similarly : marked analogies are again found within the four groups of core ionizations . in every case",
    "the profiles are quite structured , a clear consequence of the wealth of resonant states that characterize the low - energy scattering dynamics of uracil core ionization .",
    "the high - energy shape - resonant state , which is predicted to appear in all the ionization continua , causes stronger modulations on the angular distributions of the two o @xmath55 and c@xmath63 and c@xmath64 @xmath55 continua when compared with those leading to the remaining core - ionized target states .",
    "furthermore , by inspecting the partial photoionization cross section profiles for the two dipole - allowed continuum symmetries ( not reported in the figures ) it is found that for every target ion the continuum resonant states belong to the @xmath65 symmetry ( _ vide infra _ ) .",

    "the lcao - dft partial cross section and asymmetry parameter profiles for the outermost photoelectron band orbital ionizations are plotted in figures  [ fig.4 ] for the @xmath0 orbitals ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) and in figure  [ fig.5 ] for the ( oxygen lone pairs ) nonbonding @xmath1 orbitals ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) . as anticipated ,",
    "the richness of resonant features characterizing the inner - shell ionizations is partially lost when moving to the outer - valence ionizations , even if strong and well defined features clearly show up in at least two continuum channels ( corresponding to the @xmath67 and @xmath69 ionizations , central and upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] respectively ) . focusing our attention to the @xmath0 ionizations ( figure  [ fig.4 ] )",
    "the cross section profiles share a common behavior : a steep rise toward threshold and a rapid monotonic decrease for higher excitation energies .",
    "however , only in the @xmath67 continua above - threshold shape resonances are found , where both the @xmath71 and @xmath72 channels are predicted to be resonant .",
    "partial and total cross section profiles for the photoionization out of the @xmath66 orbital rise steeply at threshold , without any noticeable slope change , and a resonant state , albeit very close to threshold is visible in the @xmath72 continuum of the @xmath68 ionization and is barely apparent in the summed profile ( lower left panel of figure  [ fig.4 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding asymmetry parameters , also plotted in figure  [ fig.4 ] are almost featureless , with the exception of that corresponding to the @xmath67 ionization which displays a near - threshold oscillation typical of the formation of a resonant state , as discussed above .    partial and total cross sections for the remaining two valence ionizations considered ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 orbitals )",
    "are predicted to be quite more structured and are plotted in figure  [ fig.5 ] .",
    "both cross sections show strong oscillations near threshold in the @xmath71 continuum , and a rather broad peak above @xmath73 ev in the @xmath72 channel .",
    "similarly , the asymmetry parameter profiles are rather structured , both at low and high photon energies . table  [ table.2 ] lists , for every orbital ionization analyzed so far , the peak energy positions ( on the photoelectron kinetic energy scale ) and the symmetries of the resonant states identified .      as readily apparent from table ii , computed photoionization dynamics of uracil reveals a wealth of near - threshold structures , especially in core ionizations . for core ionizations several resonant states show up at roughly the same energy positions into several final target state channels .",
    "this is the case , for example , for the resonant @xmath71 states with peak energy positions at about @xmath58 ev , @xmath59 ev and about @xmath74 ev of photoelectron kinetic energy . as an attempt to correlate computed photoionization resonant states with those found in electron - molecule scattering calculations",
    "@xcite we then decided to analyze the resonant wave functions by inspecting the  _ dipole - prepared _ continuum wave function  @xcite .",
    "therefore the continuum wavefunction corresponding to the symmetry and peak energy positions listed in table ii have been transformed accordingly  @xcite and analyzed .",
    "nearly all the _",
    "pseudo_-bound states are diffuse in nature , extending thorugh the whole molecular skeleton .",
    "also no hint of resonant states that could be correlated with the metastable anionic state experimentally found at about 9 ev in electron - scattering experiments were found .",
    "this is quite expected in view of the different nature of the interaction potential in photoionization compared to electron - neutral target collision processes .",
    "we are therefore led to the conclusion that all relevant resonant states characterized in low - energy electron collision processes  @xcite , shift below threshold in photoionization .",
    "for the purpose of comparison with the present study it would be interesting to investigate higher energy electron - collision processes ; modeling these high energy interactions proves however a more difficult theoretical task since electronic excitation channels need to be considered as well .",
    "finally , one last comment about our theoretical results should be made . since",
    "vibrational couplings are completely neglected in our treatment of the photoionization dynamics and those invariably shorten the life - time of metastable resonant states , a broadening of the resonant structures will result with the consequence that the beautiful structuring of core ionizations cross sections predicted in the framework of the fixed - nuclei approximation will be partially lost .",
