    "submillimetre ( submm ) galaxies ( smgs ) , first detected at 850 @xmath1 m with the submillimetre common user bolometer array ( scuba ) @xcite , are a significant population of high redshift star forming galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they are believed to be dust enshrouded galaxies undergoing prodigious levels of star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in which the optical / uv radiation emitted by the stars is absorbed by the dust and then re - emitted in the submm .",
    "star formation rates in excess of 1000 m@xmath4yr@xmath5 have been inferred @xcite , much higher than locally .",
    "the galaxies in these samples have been found to account for up to one tenth of the total far - infrared / submm energetic background ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and many authors have argued that these galaxies are the progenitors for the elliptical galaxies we see in the local universe @xcite . thus understanding the nature of these sources is of great importance for the understanding of galaxy formation and evolution as a whole .",
    "observations of smgs at @xmath01 mm benefit from a negative k - correction out to high redshifts due the shape of their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . as the redshift of an smg increases , the peak of its rest - frame sed moves toward the observed waveband , offsetting the dimming caused by the increasing luminosity distance",
    ". this fact accounts for the surprising ability of scuba to find large numbers of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "the large amount of dust responsible for the strong submm emission gives rise to high levels of attenuation in the optical .",
    "this in conjunction with the poor angular resolution of single dish submm facilities makes the cross identification of smgs at different wavelengths difficult .",
    "moreover , even when an optical counterpart can be identified , the high levels of dust attenuation makes the determination of a spectroscopic redshift difficult . as such we are currently unable to determine spectroscopic redshifts for the majority of smgs . the strong correlation between dust emission and radio emission which appears to hold true in both the low - redshift and high - redshift universe @xcite has been useful for both identifying the counterparts and estimating redshifts . due to the low surface density of radio sources on the sky ,",
    "the probability of the radio counterpart being coincidental with the submm source by chance is small . due to the high positional accuracy of radio observations , it is then possible to identify the optical counterpart and retrieve a spectroscopic redshift .",
    "it is also possible to estimate the redshift using the ratio of radio to submm flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite , using the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ) @xcite on the keck i telescope , managed to obtain spectroscopic redshifts for a total of 73 radio - identified smgs with a median 850 @xmath1 m flux of 5.3 mjy .",
    "the galaxies in this sample were found to lie at a median redshift of @xmath6 out to a maximum value of @xmath7 .",
    "however , the k - correction which allows us to detect high - redshift smgs does not similarly benefit their radio fluxes and so radio identified smgs are subjected to a radio selection effect which limits redshifts to @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite , produced the first complete ( i.e. not requiring radio ids ) sample of 850 @xmath1 m selected smgs that has close to 100% redshifts .",
    "the sample consists of 35 galaxies , 21 with secure optical counterparts and 12 with tentative optical counterparts , and its completeness means that unlike previous surveys it is not biased towards low - z sources .",
    "the median redshift determined for this sample is @xmath9 . using this sample , @xcite examined the epoch dependency of the number density of smgs .",
    "they found an apparent redshift cutoff at @xmath10 with further evidence for two separately evolving populations , divided by luminosity .",
    "however this result was based on calculations using a single model galaxy sed .",
    "since the predicted relationship between submm flux - density and redshift depends strongly on the assumed sed , one of the aims of this paper is to re - examine their conclusion using a range of empirical seds .",
    "there have been a number of explanations for the lack of high - redshift smgs .",
    "given that dust is thought to form in the atmospheres of highly evolved stars , it is possible that at high redshifts simply not enough time has passed for dust to form @xcite .",
    "observations of high - redshift quasars have however detected high levels of dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that this is not the explanation .",
    "another possible explanation is that there are fewer large star - forming galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "@xcite presented evidence that smgs typically have low values for the ratio of the 850 @xmath1 m to 1200 @xmath1 m fluxes compared to that expected from a low redshift galaxy .",
    "one possible explanation is that these sources are at very high redshifts .",
    "if this is true , then observations at 1.1 mm would be better at detecting smgs at the highest redshifts than observations at 850 @xmath1 m . a new complete sample of 1.1 mm selected smgs located in the cosmos field @xcite has been compiled by @xcite .",
    "the sources were selected initially at 1.1 mm with the aztec camera @xcite on the jcmt .",
    "the resultant catalogue consists of 44 sources with s / n@xmath11 , 10 of which are robust with s / n@xmath12 .",
    "follow up observations by @xcite were then made with the submillimetre array ( sma ) at 890 @xmath1 m for the 7 highest significance aztec sources , allowing their positions to be determined with an accuracy of @xmath13  .",
    "the cosmos field offers a wealth of data over a great number of wavebands including the optical and infrared .",
    "thus the high positional accuracy allows for the identification of optical counterparts and hence the determination of photometric redshifts .",
    "of the seven aztec sources imaged with the sma six have irac counterparts , and one source is obscured by a nearby bright galaxy .",
    "using deep hubble space telescope ( hst ) imaging acquired with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) , @xcite found optical counterpart candidates for only three of these sources .",

    "we searched the i - band images ( figure  [ fig : images ] ) at the sma coordinates .",
    "we find bright i - band counterparts for aztec1 , 3 and 7 , all of which were previously known .",
    "we also find a faint i - band counterpart for aztec5 at the sma coordinates .",
    "we find no objects directly at the sma coordinates for aztec2 , but there is a bright object offset from this position by 3  , meaning that the magnitude limits of this smg are not useful .",
    "we find no optical counterparts directly at the sma coordinates for aztec4 and 6 in the subaru and cfht imaging .",
    "for the latter source , however , there is a bright i - band counterpart offset from the sma position by @xmath00.6 ",

    "there is also a faint i - band source , offset from aztec4 s sma position by @xmath00.8  ( @xmath04@xmath23 ) , in the subaru imaging .",
    "for these two sources we added the i band cfht and subaru images , inversely weighting the images by the square of the noise , in order to try and detect any very faint possible counterparts .",
    "the stacked i - band images for aztec4 and 6 are shown in figure  [ fig : images ] .",
    "we still do not find counterparts at the sma positions for aztec4 and 6 and given the good coincidence between the sma and optical positions for the other aztec sources we tentatively conclude that the true counterparts have not yet been detected .",
    "the typical full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the optical and irac channel 1 and 2 point spread functions ( psfs ) are @xmath00.8  , 1.66  and 1.72  respectively .",
    "magnitudes were determined manually by placing apertures onto the images , ensuring that the aperture was large enough to contain as much of the emission from the galaxy as possible without including any emission from neighboring objects .",
    "thus the sizes of the optical apertures vary from source to source , although are constant for a given source .",
    "we used larger apertures for the irac sources due to the images having a larger psf , but use the procedure outlined below to correct for this .    due to the difference in the psf between the optical and irac images as well as the difference in the aperture sizes , a small correction needed to be applied to the irac magnitudes before they could be used in conjunction with optical magnitudes to determine a photometric redshift .",
    "we corrected irac magnitudes by firstly fitting a 2d gaussian to the irac source .",
    "we then scaled it to have the fwhm it would have had if observed with cfht / subaru .",
    "the flux was then computed using the scaled gaussian and new aperture size .",
    "all the corrections applied in this work increase the irac magnitudes , and the more extended the source the greater the correction .",

    "we present the results of our re - examination of this result using a banded @xmath2 analysis and a range of empirical seds rather than the theoretical sed used by wall et al .",
    "the most well known method of investigating the evolution of the space density of galaxies with redshift is the @xmath41 test @xcite .",
    "@xmath42 is the co - moving volume enclosed by the galaxy ( that volume which the field of view traces out in moving from a redshift of @xmath43 out to the galaxy ) and @xmath44 is the volume that would be enclosed by the galaxy were it pushed to the redshift at which its flux drops to the survey limit .",
    "this method encounters problems when a survey encloses two galaxy populations , one undergoing positive evolution , and the other negative .",
    "if we have a uniform distribution of galaxies in space , then we expect the value of @xmath41 to be 0.5@xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the number of sources in the sample .",
    "a value of @xmath47 then implies a concentration of sources toward the more distant regions of their accessible volume and a value of @xmath48 implies a deficit of sources at higher redshifts .",
    "therefore if we have in our sample separate populations undergoing high levels of positive and negative evolution , then @xmath41 may still be close to 0.5 , incorrectly implying zero evolution .",
    "this problem can be solved by implementing instead a @xmath49 test @xcite .",
    "this is effectively a banded version of the @xmath41 test .",

    "we investigated the evolution of the space density of the sample with redshift through the implementation of a @xmath52 test .",
    "wall et al . based the k - correction necessary to calculate accessible volume on a single theoretical sed , whereas real galaxies have a range of seds . to investigate this",
    ", we carried out the @xmath52 analysis using two different assumptions about seds .",
    "we used the two extreme two - component dust models of @xcite , who provided fits to the hottest and coldest local smgs .",

    "the hot sed , based on ir1525 + 36 , contains dust at temperatures of 19 and 45 k with a cold - to - hot dust mass ratio of 15:1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : f_v_z ] , which shows the predicted flux versus redshift plot for the different models , shows the effect of using different sed templates on the flux - redshift relation .",
    "the two sed types are normalized such that they produce a flux of 1 mjy at a redshift of @xmath53 .",
    "we took the limiting flux of each source in the goods sample to be @xmath54 and measured @xmath51 for @xmath55 to 4 in steps of 0.1 .",
    "we also separated sources into two samples of equal size according to luminosity . in doing this",
    "we are able to determine whether there are differences in the evolution of the two sub - populations .    our results for the 38 smgs of wall ,",
    "pope & scott are shown in figure  [ fig : goodsveva ] .",
    "we find good evidence for the existence of a redshift cutoff at @xmath56 for the hot sed , and slightly weaker evidence for a redshift cutoff at @xmath57 for the cold sed .",
    "dividing the sample into separate populations of high and low luminosity sources shows differences in the evolution of the two populations .",
    "the low luminosity sources show much sharper redshift cutoffs whereas the evidence for redshift cutoffs in the high luminosity sources is far more marginal .",
    "thus we find evidence to support the conclusions given in @xcite : there is a redshift cutoff for the sample and that there is evidence for two separately evolving sub - populations    an additional uncertainty about this results is that @xcite claim that only 60% of their identifications are reliable .",
    "therefore we also performed the @xmath51 analysis only on sources with reliable identifications , the results of which are shown in figure  [ fig : goodsvevarobust ] . using these sources only , we still find good evidence for a redshift cutoff at @xmath56 for the hot sed , and some marginal evidence for a cutoff at @xmath57 for the cold sed .",
    "however , we are unable to find any clear evidence for two separately evolving galaxy sub - populations , separated in luminosity , as the sample size is too small .    however , by only taking into account the reliable identifications , we are probably biased towards optically brighter galaxies and therefore lower redshifts .",
    "we further investigated the effect of the unreliable identifications by putting four ( roughly half ) of the unreliable identifications at @xmath58 and repeating the analysis ( figure  [ fig : goodsveva_pushed ] ) . doing this ,",
    "we find that for hot seds our results are largely unaffected , with a relatively clear cutoff at redshifts higher than @xmath59 .",
    "however for the cold seds we find that our results are strongly affected , with no clear redshift cutoff up to a redshift of z@xmath03 .",
    "we also performed a banded @xmath51 analysis on our sample of aztec sources ( excluding the aztec6 counterpart ) the results of which are shown in figure  [ fig : aztecveva ] , but our sample is too small to find any clear evidence of a redshift cutoff .",
    "we give new subaru , cfht and irac photometry for a number of sources in the aztec / cosmos survey with accurate coordinates from sma imaging .",
    "we have estimated photometric redshifts for four of the seven galaxies in the sample .",

    "only one is at a redshift greater than our two highest redshift sources .",
    "this in addition to the fact that we are unable to detect two of our sources in the optical bands down to very faint magnitudes may indicate that 1.1  mm surveys are more efficient at detecting very high - redshift sources than 850 @xmath1 m surveys .",
    "re - investigating the space density evolution of a sample of 38 goods - n sources @xcite with more realistic seds we find a redshift cutoff at @xmath3 if we assume a hot sed and marginal evidence for a cutoff at @xmath62 if we assume a cold sed ( in reasonable agreement with wall et al . ) .",
    "similar to @xcite we also found evidence for two differently evolving sub - populations of smgs , separated in luminosity , with high luminosity sources showing a less negative evolution .",
    "we performed a similar test on the aztec sources but were unable to draw any reliable conclusions as the sample is too small .",
