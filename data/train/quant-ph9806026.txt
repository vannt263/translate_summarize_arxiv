    "this formulation has essentially two advantages compared to the conventional description : first , this approach allows the investigation of the dynamics of an individual quantum system which is continuously observed by some measurement device @xcite , whereas the reduced density matrix can only describe the state of an ensembles of quantum systems .",
    "second , from a computational point of view , the numerical integration of the quantum master equation can become rather expensive for large systems , since the reduced density matrix has @xmath7 degrees of freedom , where @xmath8 is the dimension of the system s hilbert space .",

    "[ sec : stqme ] we discuss the unravelling of quantum master equations by stochastic wave functions .",
    "this concept is well known for quantum master equations which are in lindblad form @xcite and we briefly summarize the major results in sec .  [ sec : stlind ] . in sec .",

    "this evolution equation is either obtained by a phenomenological ansatz or through a derivation which is based on a microscopic model of the system - reservoir interaction .",
    "using similar techniques , one can also obtain a markovian time evolution equation for the stochastic state vector @xmath6 .",
    "there are several phenomenological approaches which simply construct a stochastic evolution equation in such a way , that the equation of motion of the covariance matrix is the quantum master equation @xcite .",
    "this procedure is often called _ unravelling of the quantum master equation _ @xcite .",
    "other approaches are based on a continuous observation of the system under consideration by some measurement device , for example a photon detector , and employ the basic measurement postulates for the description of the dynamics of an individual quantum system @xcite . finally ,",
    "similar to the derivation of the quantum master equation , it is also possible to obtain the stochastic time evolution directly from an underlying microscopic model by an explicit derivation of the differential chapman kolmogorov equation for the probability density @xmath5 $ ] @xcite .",
    "a particular example of such a stochastic evolution equation which arises in the above approaches is the stochastic differential equation @xmath14 where the @xmath15 are the differentials of independent poisson process @xmath16 with mean @xmath17 and @xmath18 this particular equation of motion describes the time evolution of a piecewise deterministic process .",
    "the differential of the poisson process @xmath15 can either take the value @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath21 , then the system evolves continuously according to the nonlinear schrdinger - type equation @xmath22 whereas , if @xmath23 for some @xmath24 , then the system undergoes an instantaneous , discontinuous transition of the form @xmath25 note that the generator @xmath26 of the continuous time evolution is non - hermitian and hence the propagator of @xmath2 is non - unitary .",
    "however , due to the nonlinearity of the generator , the norm of @xmath2 is preserved in time .    using the standard ito calculus for the differentials @xmath15 of a poisson process , i.  e. , @xmath27 , it is easy to check , that the equation of motion of the covariance matrix of @xmath2 equals the usual markovian quantum master equation for the reduced density matrix in lindblad form .",
    "thus , both descriptions yield the same equations of motion for the expectation values of system observables .",
    "finally , we want to remark that it is also possible to extend the stochastic wave functions method to the calculation of arbitrary matrix elements of system operators and hence to the determination of multitime correlation functions @xcite .      in this section",
    "we present a generalization of the stochastic wave function method to quantum master equations which are not in lindblad form ( in sec .",

    "this form represents the most general linear equation of motion for @xmath0 , which is local in time , i.  e. , an equation of motion where @xmath33 only depends on @xmath0 . in order to find an unravelling of this equation of motion we follow a strategy , which has already been successfully applied to the calculation of multitime correlation functions @xcite",
