    "<S> we present a theoretical treatment of energy transfer in a molecular motor described in terms of overdamped brownian motion on a multidimensional tilted periodic potential . </S>",
    "<S> the tilt acts as a thermodynamic force driving the system out of equilibrium and , for non - separable potentials , energy transfer occurs between degrees of freedom . for deep potential wells , the continuous theory transforms to a discrete master equation that is tractable analytically . </S>",
    "<S> we use this master equation to derive formal expressions for the hopping rates , drift , diffusion , efficiency and rate of energy transfer in terms of the thermodynamic force . </S>",
    "<S> these results span both strong and weak coupling between degrees of freedom , describe the near and far from equilibrium regimes , and are consistent with generalized detailed balance and the onsager relations . </S>",
    "<S> we thereby derive a number of diverse results for molecular motors within a single theoretical framework . </S>"
