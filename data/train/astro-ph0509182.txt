    "we note , however , that many of the emission line detections are for candidates that have not yet been confirmed with spectroscopy or multiple narrow - band imaging .",
    "for the few objects where multiple emission lines have been detected , we have plotted the values from h-@xmath0 , h-@xmath79 , or [ o ii ] , in that order of preference .",
    "all the shown candidate detections and 3 @xmath2 upper limits have been normalized to @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "once again , the prescription of kennicutt ( 1998 ) has been used for the conversion from the h-@xmath0 luminosity @xmath49 to the sfr , and a ratio @xmath51 for case - b recombination has been assumed .",
    "no correction has been made for dust attenuation , but we examine this issue in more detail below .",
    "our apo fp constraints are among the lowest , but are clearly consistent with many other measurements .",
    "the open inverted triangles at @xmath81 are based on spectroscopic ( slit ) observations of h-@xmath0 .",
    "the unfilled circles are candidate objects with h-@xmath0 emission detected at the absorber redshift , but are often more than @xmath82 away from the quasar , and have a lower precision in redshift .",
    "the curves in fig .",
    "8 are useful for comparing the data with global predictions based on the luminosity density of galaxies from the deep galaxy imaging surveys . since most of the data in fig .",
    "8 are for objects in dla fields , we show the calculations of bunker et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for the predicted cross - section - weighted sfr in dlas .",
    "these models use two alternative sets of assumptions about the number of absorbers per unit redshift and the distribution of global sfr among individual absorbers at a given redshift .",
    "the thick and thin solid curves show the ld5 and ld0 `` large disk '' calculations ( for @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively ) , of bunker et al . based on the closed - box pei & fall ( 1995 ) models .",
    "the ld models assume that dlas are the progenitors of spiral galaxies , with space density equal to that of local spirals , but with size and sfr of each dla larger in the past compared to that of a local spiral .",
    "the dashed curve shows the h5 and h0 predictions of bunker et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ( for @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively ) for the `` hierarchical '' hypothesis , which assumes that there were multiple dlas at high redshift corresponding to every present - day spiral ( i.e. that dlas were sub - galactic fragments that later merged to form present - day spirals ) .",
    "thus in the h5 and h0 models , dlas have the same distribution of gas cross - section sizes as in local spirals , but with a higher space density in the past , and have smaller sfrs than in the corresponding `` large - disk '' models .",
    "the ld curve , if computed for @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , would lie between the ld5 and ld0 curves , since the distance and time scales for the former cosmology are intermediate between those for @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "this can also be seen by comparing the comoving global sfr predicted by the pei & fall ( 1995 ) closed - box models for @xmath83 and @xmath84 , with that predicted by the @xmath87-cold dark matter ( @xmath87-cdm ) hydrodynamical simulations of nagamine , cen , & ostriker ( 2000 ) .",
    "thus , a large fraction of the observed sfrs would appear to fall significantly below the prediction of the large - disk scenario .",
    "the h curve for this @xmath87-cdm cosmology would be identical to the h5 and h0 curves ( since the latter curves coincide with each other ) . a large fraction of the data points in fig . 8",
    "thus appear to be more consistent with the hierarchical scenario , suggesting perhaps that many absorbers or their companion galaxies may be arising in star - forming dwarf galaxies or sub - galactic fragments that merged later to form present - day galaxies .",
    "however , several detections and upper limits , including our fp limits , appear to be considerably below even the hierarchical prediction . indeed , about 63@xmath88 of the detections and about 73@xmath88 of the limits plotted in fig .",
    "8 are less than 5 @xmath8 yr@xmath5",
    ". such large local deviations for the absorber fields from the global mean would be surprising .",
    "taken at face value , fig .",
    "8 suggests that the absorption - based view of the cosmic star formation history could be quite different from the emission - based view , i.e. , from the star formation history inferred on the basis of the direct galaxy imaging surveys such as the hubble deep field .",
    "low sfrs for galaxies in absorber fields would also be consistent with the low global metallicities found in dlas ( e.g. , kulkarni et al . 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "similar suggestions have also been made by wolfe et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who inferred relatively high sfr values for some dlas based on c ii * absorption , but found the high sfrs to be inconsistent with the low metallicities observed in the dlas .",
    "we note , however , that while the c ii * method may potentially offer an interesting way to estimate sfrs in dlas , it seems less direct and more model - dependent than the emission - line based constraints .",
    "there are also other possible interpretations of fig 8 .",
    "it is possible that the true sfrs in galaxies in the absorber fields are higher , but their emission lines , especially ly-@xmath0 , are attenuated by dust .",
    "it is well known that resonance scattering of ly-@xmath0 , in the presence of dust , can lead to quenching of the lyman-@xmath0 emission in high-@xmath89 systems ( e.g. , charlot & fall 1991 ) .",
    "presence of dust in some ly-@xmath0 emitting regions is also suggested from the recent detection of 24 @xmath18 m emission in spitzer space telescope images of laes at @xmath72 in an absorber field ( colbert et al .",
    "on the other hand , there are several reasons to expect that ly-@xmath0 emission may still be seen from absorbers and their companion galaxies , in at least some cases .",
    "first , the very knowledge of a dla means that the quasar in which it appears is not greatly affected by dust attenuation .",
    "ly-@xmath0 is easily seen from regions of such low extinction .",
    "second , the dust - to - gas ratios in dlas inferred from relative abundances such as [ cr / zn ] or [ fe / zn ] are much smaller than in the milky way ( e.g. , pettini et al . 1997 ; khare et al .",
    "2004 ; and references therein ) . in a recent study of a large number of sdss quasar spectra",
    ", we have recently found evidence for a statistically significant but small amount of dust in quasar absorbers ( york et al .",
    "finally , there are several examples of high-@xmath9 ly-@xmath0 emitters with very little dust attenuation ( e.g. , giavalisco et al .",
    "1994 ; francis et al . 1996",
    "; hu , cowie , & mcmahon 1998 ; kudritzki et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the effect of dust attenuation is expected to be much less severe in the h-@xmath0 line .",
    "indeed , the sfr constraints based on h-@xmath0 detections in most high-@xmath9 dla candidates or companions shown in fig 8 are considerably higher than the constraints from the ly-@xmath0 emission searches . considering detections alone ,",
    "the median sfrs from h-@xmath0 , ly-@xmath0 , and [ oii ] are 35.9 , 3.2 , and 0.3 @xmath8 yr@xmath5 , respectively . if both detections and limits are considered , the median sfrs from h-@xmath0 , ly-@xmath0 , and [ oii ] are 28.2 , 2.4 , and 0.3 @xmath8 yr@xmath5 treating the limits as detections , and 18.8 , 0.1 , and 0.3 @xmath8 yr@xmath5 treating the limits as zeros .",
    "it is tempting to think that the difference between the median h-@xmath0 and ly-@xmath0 values could be partly caused by dust extinction .",
    "however , it is not clear whether this is a significant effect , since ly-@xmath0 measurements ( candidates or limits ) are not available for most of the h-@xmath0 candidates . in the few objects that show detections of multiple emission lines ,",
    "the sfr estimates from the available lines are usually consistent within a factor of @xmath90 .",
    "also , some of the h-@xmath0 candidates are at large angular separations from the quasars and have less accurate redshifts . thus , there is no clear indication that ly-@xmath0 in the h-@xmath0 candidates is attenuated by dust . in any case ,",
    "dust alone may not explain low ly-@xmath0 emission in every individual case , because the extent of ly-@xmath0 attenuation also depends on several other factors , such as the orientation , the topology of the h ii region , and the distribution of stars , gas and dust within the absorber .",
    "finally , dust attenuation can not explain why nearly all of the sfrs inferred from [ o ii ] and @xmath91 of the sfrs inferred from h-@xmath0 are low .",
    "another possibility is that the star - forming regions in the absorber galaxies are compact , lie directly in front of the quasars , and hence get lost in the quasar point spread function ( psf ) in our study and other ground - based studies so far .",
    "for example , if the absorbing galaxies had star - forming cores comparable in size to those in the lyman - break galaxies [ typically @xmath92 kpc ] aligned perfectly in front of the quasars , it would not be possible to resolve them with studies such as our own ( and most other ground - based studies used in fig .",
    "in other words , the sfr constraints derived from such studies may be more appropriate for the companion galaxies of the absorbers , rather than the absorbers themselves .",
    "it is difficult to rule out this possibility without high - resolution imaging data .",
    "however , the chance of having the star forming region exactly in front of the quasar in _ each _ case is small .",
    "indeed , the absence of emission within the ly-@xmath0 absorption profiles in the published spectra for most dlas ( including those from our study ) suggests that they do not have star - forming regions perfectly aligned with the background quasars . even if the absorber galaxies themselves were small",
    ", they are unlikely to be isolated objects , since such small galaxies are expected to occur as companions to larger galaxies within a few hundred kpc . in any case",
    ", it would still be surprising why the few existing high - resolution imaging studies of absorber galaxies have often failed to detect h-@xmath0 emission or found relatively weak ly-@xmath0 emission ( e.g. , bouche et al .",
    "2001 ; kulkarni et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ; mller et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "future narrow - band imaging studies of more high - redshift quasar absorber fields would help to understand whether the low ly-@xmath0 fluxes we find are representative of the absorber galaxies .",
    "furthermore , more narrow - band imaging or spectroscopic studies in the near - infrared will give access to the h-@xmath0 emission line from the @xmath93 absorbers .",
    "a systematic comparison of the h-@xmath0 and ly-@xmath0 data for the same absorbers can help to understand whether the emission lines in the galaxies in absorber fields are simply attenuated by dust , or whether these galaxies truly have low sfrs .",
    "it will thus be interesting to look at ly-@xmath0 emission from the objects reported to show strong h-@xmath0 emission , and to look at h-@xmath0 near the quasars for which we have limits on ly-@xmath0 .",
    "finally , more high - resolution narrow - band imaging and/or spectroscopic studies would be especially important to understand whether the star formation in the absorber galaxies is restricted to compact regions .",

    "<S> we have carried out a deep narrow - band imaging survey of six fields with heavy - element quasar absorption lines , using the goddard fabry - perot ( fp ) system at the apache point observatory ( apo ) 3.5-meter telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of these observations was to search for redshifted ly-@xmath0 emission from the galaxies underlying the absorbers at @xmath1 and their companion galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the 3 @xmath2 sensitivity levels ranged between @xmath3 and @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 in observed - frame ly-@xmath0 flux . </S>",
    "<S> no significant ly-@xmath0 emitters were detected at @xmath7 level . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of significant ly-@xmath0 emission implies limits on the star formation rate ( sfr ) of 0.9 - 2.7 @xmath8 yr@xmath5 per 2-pixel x 2-pixel region , if no dust attenuation is assumed . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results with those from other emission - line studies of absorber fields and with predictions for global average sfr based on the models of cosmic chemical evolution . </S>",
    "<S> our limits are among the tightest existing constraints on ly-@xmath0 emission from galaxies in absorber fields , but are consistent with many other studies . in the absence of dust attenuation </S>",
    "<S> , these studies suggest that sfrs in a large fraction of objects in the absorber fields may lie below the global mean sfr . however , it is possible that dust attenuation is responsible for the low emission line fluxes in some objects . </S>",
    "<S> it is also possible that the star - forming regions are compact and at smaller angular separations from the quasar than the width of our point spread function and , get lost in the quasar emission . </S>",
    "<S> we outline future observations that could help to distinguish between the various possibilities . </S>"
