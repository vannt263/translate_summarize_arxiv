    "for the numerical solution of the poisson equation on irregular domains , the use of finite differences and finite elements with triangulations obtained by subdividing each grid cell of a structured grid along a diagonal has been addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , proving that the finite difference approach on such grids is accurate enough .",
    "however , since structured grids often have some elongated cells , a natural question that arises in this context is whether this numerical solution is more accurate than the solution obtained by using finite elements on a standard delaunay - like triangulation .",
    "+ in this paper , we compare the accuracy of the numerical solution for this problem using finite differences in structured grids , and finite elements on delaunay - like triangulations .",
    "we are specifically interested in irregular boundaries , since their geometry is closer to a realistic domain , for instance , a lake . + in order to generate the structured convex grids , a variational method was used .",
    "the latter consists of minimizing an appropriate functional @xcite . area and harmonic functionals can be used for gridding a wide variety of simple connected domains in the plane @xcite , whose boundaries are closed polygonal jordan curves with positive orientation . + if @xmath0 and @xmath1 represent the  vertical \" and  horizontal \" numbers of points of the  sides \" , then the boundary is the positively oriented polygonal curve @xmath2 of vertices @xmath3 , and it defines the typical domain @xmath4 . +",
    "a doubly indexed set @xmath5 of points of the plane with the fixed boundary positions given by @xmath6 is a logically rectangular structured grid with quadrilateral elements for @xmath4 , of order @xmath7 . +",
    "a grid @xmath8 is convex if and only if each one of the @xmath9 quadrilaterals ( or cells ) @xmath10 of vertices @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , is convex and non - degenerate ( see fig . [ suave ] ) . +    the basis for the direct optimization method , as developed by ivanenko _",
    "@xcite , is the minimization a suitable function of the form @xmath14 where @xmath10 is the @xmath15 grid cell and @xmath16 is a function of its vertices ; the problem is to find the coordinates of the interior points of the grid @xmath8 .",
    "the functional used to generate the structured grids of the numerical tests , as implemented in unamalla @xcite , was the adaptive linear convex combination of the area functional @xmath17 described in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the length functional @xmath18 with weight @xmath19 ( see ref .",
    "+ the parameter @xmath20 , which is a scale factor , can be updated in such a way that in a finite number of updates the combined functional attain its minima within the set of convex grids for @xmath4 if the latter is nonempty .",
    "further properties of this functional , as well as the algorithm for updating its parameter has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "+ the triangulations we considered for this paper are those generated by distmesh @xcite , which is based on the physical analogy between a simplex mesh and a truss structure , where the meshpoints are nodes of the truss .",
    "it generates an initial delaunay triangulation , then assumes an appropriate force - displacement function for the bars in the truss at each iteration , and finally solves for equilibrium ( see fig .",
    "[ rrr42 ] ) . in order to have grids with a similar number of elements , we used two initializations : a ) the initial edge length for distmesh was set in proportion to half the average diagonal length of the structured grids , b ) a variation of distmesh was designed for which the initial points inside the region are the inner nodes of the corresponding structured grid . +",
    "it must be noted that for very irregular boundaries , distmesh might produce a few triangular elements along the boundary which do not satisfy the delaunay condition .",
    "standard difference schemes can be generalized by considering a finite set of nodes @xmath21 , for which it is required to find coefficients @xmath22 such that @xcite @xmath23 as it is well known , the @xmath24 values can be calculated with ease in regular regions .",
    "however , despite the basic idea is quite simple , the application to taylor s theorem leads to more complicated schemes on irregular regions ; up to our knowledge , there are few efficient schemes for such kind of regions",
    ". + the calculation of these coefficients has been studied by tinoco _",
    "et al _ @xcite , and shashkov @xcite .",
    "we make use of the second order scheme developed for the boundary value problem @xmath25 with non - diagonal matrices @xmath26 studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is based on the method of support - operators and has the advantage of providing explicit formulas for the @xmath24 coefficients ) . ] .",
    "+ in the numerical experiments , we selected the @xmath27 subgrid defined for the nodes @xmath28 , @xmath29 to approximate @xmath30 at the inner grid node @xmath31 .",
    "as in the rectangular case , an algebraic system of equations is obtained from discretization , which becomes sparse as @xmath0 and @xmath1 increase .",
    "let @xmath32 be the number of triangular elements in a grid .",
    "galerkin s approach to the solution of equation ( [ eqfuerte ] ) is given by the combination @xmath33 of trial - test pyramid functions whose faces are defined on a triangle by @xmath34 this selection yields the weak formulation @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the canonical inner product ( see ref .",
    "+ there are several other possible choices of elements . however , as it is well known , the use of pyramids on triangulations allows a very simple second order approximation to the solution of equation ( [ eqfuerte ] ) .",
    "for the numerical tests , we have selected 9 polygonal regions , most of them approximations to real geographical locations : they will be denoted as dome ( dom ) , great britain ( eng ) , havana bay ( hab ) , m19 ( m19 ) , mxico ( mex ) , plow ( plo ) , swan ( swa ) , ucha ( uch ) and michoacn ( mic ) .",
    "they are shown in figure 3 .",
    "+    to    scaling these boundaries in order to lie in @xmath37\\times[0,1]$ ] , convex grids with 21 , 41 and 81 points per side were generated by minimizing the @xmath38 functional in unamalla with default parameters .",
    "the resulting structured grids were used with shashkov s finite difference schemes @xcite .",
    "as mentioned before , they were also used as initial data for some triangulations .",
    "+ distmesh was used to triangulate the same test polygonal boundaries with default parameters , setting the bar length as half the average diagonal length calculated in the corresponding structured grids ( denoted as @xmath39 ) .",
    "a variation of distmesh was also designed , for which the initial points inside the region are the inner nodes of the corresponding structured grid : these grids are denoted as @xmath40 grids . + the number of elements and inner nodes in each grid can be seen in in table [ tab : ne ] .",

    "the strong non convexities on some boundaries are clearly reflected in the error magnitudes and in a slight decrease of the empirical order ; this can be explained in terms of the presence of elongated elements .",

    "in addition , the side selection was quite arbitrary , and no boundary was processed in any way in order to avoid simplifying the problems .",
    "thus , strong non convex boundaries are clearly reflected in the quadratic errors ( _ e.g .",
    "great britain , m19 and ucha _ ) , but these choices were done so because we wanted to deal with a ",
    "hard \" problem , although it must be acknowledged that boundary preprocessing is an excellent strategy to improve numerical results in general grids .",
    "+ however , the use of irregular fixed boundaries is precisely what leads to the main conclusion : as follows from the numerical experiments , no method seems to be notably more accurate than the others ; difference schemes applied on structured meshes can indeed be used to produce reliable approximations to the solution of the test problems . in other words , triangulations are not the only reliable choice for such regions , it is also possible to generate accurate numerical solutions using grids generated by variational methods in very irregular regions , and this approach has not been thoroughly studied yet . as we mentioned , this is an important issue , since differences are based on logically rectangular grids , and , in consequence , their algorithmic implementations are rather simple . + our current research deals with time - dependent partial differential equations on irregular domains , and the corresponding results will be reported in a future paper .",
