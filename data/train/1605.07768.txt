    "holographic duality is the fascinating proposal that quantum field theories of a _ boundary _ system are _ dual _ to quantum gravity theories of an associated higher - dimensional _ bulk _ spacetime .",
    "this proposal found a stunningly precise realisation in the work of maldacena @xcite who argued that there is an exact equivalence between string theory on @xmath1 and @xmath2 supersymmetric yang - mills theory on the four - dimensional boundary .",
    "this was quickly solidified by gubser , klebanov , and polyakov @xcite and witten @xcite .",
    "since these foundational works there has been a huge amount of effort exporing such ads / cft dualities .",
    "most recently , quantum information ideas have been exploited to provide microscopic toy models to understand quantum gravity @xcite and bulk / boundary correspondences @xcite .",
    "the idea that a bulk holographic spacetime might be associated with the entanglement structure of a boundary quantum system finds its antecedents in the early works of jacobsen @xcite and holzhey , larsen , and wilczek @xcite : jacobsen argued that einstein s equations arise from black hole thermodynamics and might find their best interpretation as an equation of state ( see @xcite for a thorough account and references ) . by combining jacobsen s observation with the earlier derivations of the area law of entanglement in conformal field theory @xcite one",
    "could already see a kernel of later developments in embryonic form .",
    "the precise connection between bulk geometries and the structure of entanglement of low - energy states of a boundary system was realised by ryu and takayanagi , who conjectured  based on analogies with black hole entropy via the ads / cft correspondence  that the amount of entanglement on the boundary of the spacetime is given by the area ( in planck units ) of certain extremal surfaces ( of co - dimension @xmath3 ) in the bulk @xcite .",
    "the ryu - takayanagi conjecture was later reduced to the original ads / cft relation by lewkowycz and maldacena @xcite .",
    "however , it took until van raamsdonk s essay @xcite before the full scale of the connection between quantum entanglement , as geometric glue , and quantum gravity began to be emerge . during the same year",
    ", swingle had independently drawn in @xcite largely the same conclusion as van raamsdonk .",
    "further arguments for the connection between entanglement and geometry via tensor networks were then developed in @xcite .",
    "swingle and van raamsdonk later coauthored an investigation into dynamics : they have since managed to derive einstein s equations linearized around pure ads @xcite , providing further evidence that the dynamics of spacetime , as well as its geometry , indeed emerge from the structure of entanglement . concurrently ,",
    "maldacena and susskind @xcite put forward their er = epr conjecture according to which a wormhole is equivalent to an entangled pair of black holes  significantly strengthening support for the idea of geometrising entanglement .",
    "the proposals we discuss are found in recent works @xcite and talks @xcite of van raamsdonk , swingle , susskind , and stanford : the core idea we explore is that the pattern of the entanglement of a ( boundary ) state @xmath4 of a collection of degrees of freedom ( qubits for simplicity ) determines a dual bulk holographic spacetime via the _ principle of minimal complexity_. in particular , in this paper we discuss a precise approach to associating a bulk geometry , as a _ topological space _",
    ", with a quantum system comprised of a discrete collection of degrees of freedom and discuss the relationship between fluctuations of the bulk geometry and perturbations of the boundary quantum system . to that end , in the next section we review the prerequisite material and introduce all the necessary preliminary machinery to discuss correlated quantum systems and bulk geometries . in sec .  [",
    "sec : btg ] we introduce two alternative ways , both capturing the essence of the principle of minimal complexity , to associate a bulk holographic spacetime , as a topological space , with the low - energy sector of a strongly correlated boundary quantum system . following this , in sec .",
    "[ sec : cabf ] we introduce an action , building on the principle of minimal complexity , to model fluctuations of the bulk holographic spacetime .",
    "the connection between boundary perturbations and bulk fluctuations is then developed in sec .",
    "[ sec : bpjf ] , where jacobi fields play a prominent role .",
    "these ideas are then explored in the context of several simple examples in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions and outlook .",
    "the language and notation we use throughout this paper is influenced by that employed in the literature on the ads / cft correspondence ; we summarise it here briefly to orient the reader .",
    "firstly , we refer throughout to two rather different systems , namely , the _ bulk _ @xmath5 and the _ boundary _ @xmath6 . in the ads",
    "/ cft context the bulk system @xmath5 is the ads spacetime and the boundary @xmath7 is the cft . here",
    "the boundary system @xmath6 is taken to be a quantum system comprised of @xmath8 distinguishable subsystems .",
    "one particular example plays a prominent role throughout this paper , namely that of @xmath8 _ qubits _ where @xmath6 has hilbert space given by @xmath9 .",
    "( the calculations for the qubit case are representative of more complicated examples such as qudits or even harmonic oscillators , in which case the boundary hilbert space is given by @xmath10 . ) the bulk system is a `` _ _ classical system _ _ '' which , for the purposes of this paper , is taken to be a _ topological space _",
    "@xmath11 with point set @xmath12 and an , as yet undetermined , topology @xmath13 .",
    "the point set @xmath14 corresponds to a partially discretised _ holographic spacetime _ with discrete boundary `` spatial '' coordinates and an additional continuous `` holographic time '' or `` radial '' coordinate referred to , henceforth , as @xmath15 .",
    "since the boundary system is a standard quantum system , and we are working in the hamiltonian picture , there is an additional `` standard time coordinate '' @xmath16 ( corresponding to the usual time for a boundary cft ) ; we always work on a single time slice for both the boundary and bulk and hence this coordinate is suppressed throughout . thus , unless otherwise specified , whenever we say `` time @xmath17 '' we are referring to the holographic time / radial coordinate .    the boundary system is intended to capture _ all _ of the _ relevant _ low - energy degrees of freedom of some _ boundary hamiltonian _ @xmath18 .",
    "for example , if @xmath19 is _ gapped _ with a unique ground state then there is only _",
    "one _ relevant low - energy degree of freedom , namely the ground state @xmath20 , in which case the boundary hilbert space is just @xmath21 .",
    "a slightly more nontrivial example is that of a ferromagnet in a small magnetic field where the relevant degrees of freedom are the vacuum and the single - magnon sector ; here the relevant hilbert space is @xmath22 .",
    "a somewhat nontrivial example is that of the hubbard model with @xmath8 sites at half filling with large on - site repulsion , in which case only the spin degrees of freedom are relevant and thus @xmath23 .",
    "a final example , which we do nt pursue here , is that of a system of @xmath8 anyons in general position . in this case",
    "@xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the total quantum dimension .",
    "the boundary hamiltonians @xmath26 are taken to be _ local _ with respect to some finite simple graph @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the _ vertex set _ representing the @xmath8 subsystems and @xmath29 is the _ edge set _ representing interactions , i.e. , @xmath30 where @xmath31 are hermitian operators acting nontrivially only on subsystems @xmath32 and @xmath33 and as the identity otherwise , and @xmath34 means that @xmath35 is an edge of the graph @xmath36 .",
    "states of the boundary hilbert space @xmath37 may be specified in terms of a trivial reference basis , henceforth called the _ computational basis _ , which is usually determined by a _",
    "trivial _ or _ elementary _ initial local hamiltonian . for our quantum spin system",
    "this is just the product basis @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ( for a system of harmonic oscillators , this would be the overcomplete basis @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath40 , of all coherent states ) .",
    "the boundary hamiltonian determines a second basis via the unitary @xmath0 which diagonalises @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath43 , with @xmath44 diagonal .",
    "because global phases are irrelevant the unitary @xmath0 may be understood as an element of the _ special unitary group _ @xmath45 .",
    "it is worth noting that even if @xmath26 is rather simple , e.g. , @xmath36 is a line graph , that @xmath0 can be extremely difficult to determine in general ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein for examples ) .",
    "the unitary @xmath0 diagonalising the boundary hamiltonian @xmath26 is the central object of interest here : its entangling structure determines an associated dual holographic bulk spacetime @xmath5 .",
    "the way this is done is by studying the _ quantum information complexity _ of @xmath0 counting the number of nontrivial quantum gates required to implement @xmath0 .",
    "a powerful method to precisely capture the information complexity of a unitary @xmath46 was introduced by nielsen and coauthors @xcite , who proposed , for certain specific metrics on the tangent space @xmath47 of @xmath48 at @xmath0 , @xmath49 the _ geodesic length _ @xmath50 between the identity @xmath51 and @xmath0 as an appropriate measure , where @xmath52 and the infimum is over all curves @xmath53 with tangent vector @xmath54 connecting @xmath0 to the identity @xmath55 , i.e. , we have , via integration of the schrdinger equation @xmath56 , that @xmath57 and @xmath58 , for some @xmath59 .",
    "all the metrics in this paper are taken to be right invariant by identifying the tangent space at @xmath55 with that at @xmath60 via @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a tangent vector are hence antihermitian operators of the form @xmath63 , with @xmath64 hermitian .",
    "] at @xmath51 .",
    "accordingly the metric @xmath65 is constant as a function of @xmath0 and we henceforth write @xmath66 .",
    "one particular family of metrics plays a key role in this paper , namely @xmath67 where @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "when @xmath70 $ ] this is the _ depolarising channel_. for the special case that @xmath71 this metric reduces to the standard right - invariant metric on @xmath48 : @xmath72 in general , as @xmath73",
    "is increased , the measure @xmath74 admits the pleasing operational interpretation as ( being proportional to ) the minimal number of quantum gates required to ( approximately ) implement @xmath0 as a quantum circuit @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath71 does not admit as natural an operational interpretation as the @xmath75 case , nevertheless , we carry out most of our example calculations with respect to the @xmath71 metric because it so much easier .",
    "( note , however , all the conclusions we draw in this paper hold also for the general case @xmath76 . )",
    "the metrics @xmath77 are all examples of right - invariant metrics on a lie group .",
    "this class of metric allows for elegant computations ; the vector field @xmath78 associated with the geodesic flow @xmath79 satisfies a compact equation known as the _ euler - arnold equation _",
    "@xmath80 where @xmath81 is a bilinear form determined by @xmath82,z\\rangle_p \\equiv \\langle b(z , y ) , x\\rangle_p$ ] , @xmath83 @xcite . in the special case @xmath71 and when",
    "@xmath0 is sufficiently close to @xmath55 , i.e. , @xmath55 and @xmath0 are not _ conjugate points _ of @xmath48 , then the geodesic @xmath79 is simply given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is _",
    "constant_.    the nielsen complexity measure was taken up by susskind and coworkers as a central tool to determine a bulk holographic space @xmath5 from a _ state _",
    "@xmath4 of the boundary space @xmath6 specified by @xmath26 . here",
    "the idea is as follows .",
    "take as input a quantum state @xmath86 of the boundary hilbert space and first find the unitary @xmath0 of _ minimal complexity _",
    "@xmath87 which prepares @xmath4 from an initial trivial state @xmath88 , i.e. , @xmath89 .",
    "now , assuming that the infimum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : geodesicdist ] ) may be _ achieved _ by the geodesic @xmath79 with tangent vector @xmath78 , we can write @xmath90 where @xmath13 denotes time ordering .",
    "this expression may then be approximated by discretisation : we find a _ quantum circuit _",
    "@xmath91 , where @xmath92 , @xmath93 , are _ quantum gates _ acting on one or two qubits at a time , such that @xmath94 :        that this can always be done is not totally trivial ; see @xcite for the state of the art .",
    "the _ spacetime history _ of the circuit @xmath28 determines a connectivity or adjacency relation on the _ vertex _ or _ point set _ @xmath95 : we place an edge between vertices @xmath96 and @xmath97 if the two - qubit gate @xmath98 , @xmath99 , acts nontrivially on qubits @xmath32 and @xmath33 :        if the boundary system @xmath6 is thought of as having @xmath25 spacetime `` dimensions '' then the resulting graph with vertex set @xmath14 is a classical geometrical space having spacetime dimension @xmath100 , with the role of the _ holographic time _ axis being played by the set @xmath101 .",
    "we follow a slightly different , yet morally equivalent , approach to associating a bulk holographic geometry to a boundary system in this paper , where the holographic time dimension is continuous .",
    "we detail this idea in the next section .",
    "in this section we explain how to associate a bulk topological space to any path @xmath102 in @xmath48 connecting the identity @xmath55 to a unitary @xmath0 acting on the boundary space .",
    "let @xmath102 be a path connecting @xmath55 to @xmath0 in @xmath48 . as a matrix we express @xmath102 as a time - ordered product @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a possibly time - dependent traceless hermitian operator generating the evolution at @xmath79 .",
    "the matrix @xmath105 may be regarded as a time - dependent hamiltonian acting on the boundary system .",
    "we can express @xmath105 as a sum of interaction terms acting on the subsystems of @xmath6 : @xmath106 where @xmath107 is an operator acting nontrivially only on the subsystems in the subset @xmath108 .",
    "in general , for the metrics we consider here , all possible subsets @xmath108 can appear , and there are exponentially many ( in @xmath8 ) interaction terms . in other words",
    ", @xmath105 is generically a strongly interacting quantum spin system .",
    "we want to associate a topological space to @xmath105 for each _ instantaneous holographic time slice _ @xmath109 $ ] .",
    "there are many operationally meaningful ways to do this , depending on the physical questions you ask .",
    "one way is to interpret @xmath105 as a _ free - particle hamiltonian _ for some possibly very complicated configuration space @xmath110 which is built by matching the dispersion relation of the localised excitations of @xmath105 to that of the free - particle hamiltonian on @xmath110 .",
    "another way , one of which we focus on here , is to study the response of high - temperature states @xmath111 , with @xmath112 small , to localised perturbations @xmath113 and @xmath114 at different sites : at zero inverse temperature @xmath115 all perturbations on different sites will be completely uncorrelated , however , when @xmath112 is small there are residual correlations between _ nearby _ sites allowing us to say when two sites are _",
    "close_. this approach , while somewhat indirect , has the considerable upside that it immediately leads to a positive - definite metric . yet another approach is to study the propagation of a localised perturbation @xmath113 at some site @xmath32 according to the schrdinger time evolution determined by @xmath105 and _ assuming _ a lieb - robinson type bound @xcite on the dynamics of @xmath105 : @xmath116\\| \\le ce^{v|\\tau|-d(j , k ) } \\|a\\|\\|b\\|,\\ ] ] where @xmath117 is a constant , @xmath118 is the group velocity , and @xmath114 is an observable localised at some other site @xmath33 . such a bound can be used to infer a _",
    "pseudo - riemannian _ type structure via a _ causality relation _ on the set @xmath119 which can , in turn , be quantified in terms of a _ causal set _ leading to an embedding in a lorentz manifold .",
    "( here @xmath16 is the standard time coordinate for the boundary quantum system . )",
    "we discuss this idea in the second subsection .",
    "these last two proposals may be regarded as a wick - rotated `` euclidean approach '' and `` lorentzian approach '' , respectively , to the problem of building bulk holographic spacetimes associated with paths of unitaries .",
    "suppose that a quantum system of @xmath8 quantum spins @xmath120 with hamiltonian @xmath105 is brought into thermal equilibrium at inverse temperature @xmath112 : the state of the system is described by the gibbs ensemble @xmath121 consider the effect of a small perturbation @xmath122 localised at site @xmath32 ( respectively , a small perturbation @xmath123 localised at site @xmath33 ) : the resulting system state is now @xmath124 respectively , @xmath125 ( the reason for the factor of @xmath126 is that elements of @xmath127 are _ antihermitian _ in this paper . )",
    "now we ask the question : how _ distinguishable _ is the perturbed state @xmath128 from the state @xmath129 ?",
    "we say that the local perturbation @xmath113 at site @xmath32 is _ close _ , or _",
    "adjacent _ , to the perturbation @xmath114 local to site @xmath33 if the states @xmath128 and @xmath129 are _ not completely distinguishable_. that this notion corresponds to a topological / geometrical conception of closeness may be argued as follows .",
    "if the temperature is very high , i.e. , near to the infinite - temperature fixed point @xmath130 , then all correlations are disordered by thermal fluctuations . the effects of a local perturbation are hence delocalised only in a small surrounding region determined by the high - temperature correlation length , which directly depends on the inverse temperature . hence ,",
    "if @xmath128 and @xmath129 are independent fluctuations , i.e. , they are uncorrelated , we say that @xmath113 is _ far _ from @xmath114 , otherwise , they are adjacent .",
    "this region , in turn , determines the desired adjacency relation for the sites @xmath32 and @xmath33 which , in turn , supplies us with a metric quantity .",
    "it is a remarkable fact that the quantum informational distinguishability , as measured by the relative entropy @xmath131 , of the states @xmath128 and @xmath129 is quantified to @xmath132 by the following equation @xcite : @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the _ free energy _",
    "@xmath135 this idea has also been exploited in various incarnations by nozaki , ryu , and takayanagi @xcite to identify metrics for holographic spacetimes and is most directly inspired by the distance quantity exploited by qi in investigations of the exact holographic mapping @xcite .",
    "rather fortuitiously , the quantity @xmath136 is a positive definite _ inner product _ on the space of local operators .",
    "additionally , it is equal to the following two - point thermal correlation function @xmath137 it is this quantity that we employ to determine an adjacency relation between the sites .    when @xmath112 is infinitesimal the two - point thermal correlation function",
    "is given by @xmath138 however , we also know @xcite that the high - temperature two - point correlation functions are exponentially decaying for @xmath112 small : @xmath139 where , generically , the high - temperature correlation length tends to zero like @xmath140 as @xmath141 .",
    "( the exponential decay of high - temperature correlations notably does _ not _ hold for bosonic systems , and we must resort to other means in this case . ) thus , if @xmath142 is nonzero for @xmath112 infinitesimal when @xmath143 this means that @xmath144 must be arbitrarily small , i.e. , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are _",
    "adjacent_.    our task is thus to extract a distance measure , or metric , @xmath144 from @xmath142 .",
    "one direct way of doing this is simply to take a log of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gdecay ] ) , i.e. , define @xmath145 similar to the approach of qi @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is not clear if @xmath144 so defined satisfies the triangle inequality @xmath146 .",
    "we will evade this problem by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : metricfirst ] ) only to identify an _ adjacency relation _ between pairs of spins @xmath35 and then use this adjacency relation to build a metric .",
    "what this means is we first set up the _ adjacency matrix _ @xmath147",
    "this defines a weighted graph structure @xmath148 on the vertex set @xmath149 . for any pair of points @xmath32 and @xmath33 in @xmath36",

    "this is guaranteed to obey the triangle inequality .",
    "thus we define the metric @xmath144 according to @xmath152    the definition of the metric we supply in this subsection is difficult to compute in general . we can build a computable approximation by comparing eq .",

    "@xmath155 ( this is the case when @xmath73 ) then to first order in @xmath112 this is equivalent to asking if there are traceless operators @xmath113 at @xmath32 and @xmath114 at @xmath33 such that @xmath156 i.e. , @xmath32 is adjacent to @xmath33 if the two - particle interaction term @xmath155 in @xmath105 is nonzero .",
    "physically this is equivalent to saying that @xmath32 and @xmath33 are adjacent if at time @xmath17 an ( infinitesimal ) quantum gate was applied coupling @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in the case where @xmath157 is comprised of three - particle or higher interactions we need to go to higher orders in @xmath112 to determine a connectivity relation ( at first order the condition eq .",
