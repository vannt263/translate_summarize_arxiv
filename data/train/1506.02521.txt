    "the contribution of this study is as follows .",
    "first , based on the notion of stable manifold originated from dynamical systems theory @xcite we propose a method for constructing a sequence of approximate solutions of increasing accuracy to general equilibrium perfect foresight models on nonlocal domains .",
    "second , we prove the convergence of the proposed approximate solutions to the true one , pointing out approximation errors and domain where solutions are defined . in this way ,",
    "the result is a new proof of the stable manifold theorem @xcite .",
    "third , we establish the relations between the approach presented in this paper and the extended path method ( ep ) proposed by @xcite , and show that the approach can be considered as a rigorous proof of convergence of the ep algorithm .    a stable",
    "manifold is a set of points that approach the saddle point as time tends to infinity @xcite .",
    "in fact , the set of solutions to a nonlinear rational expectations model determines the stable manifold because each solution must satisfy the stability condition , i.e. the convergence to the steady state in the long - run . in economic literature , this set is represented by a graph of a policy function ( in other words , a decision function ) that maps the state variables into the control variables .",
    "since we primarily focus on constructing approximations of stable manifolds ( not the manifolds themselves ) , we shall call the approach proposed in this paper the approximate stable manifolds ( asm ) method .",
    "the existence of stable manifolds in the dynamical systems literature is proved using either the lyapunov - perron method or the graph transformation method of hadamard @xcite .",
    "the hadamard method constructs the entire stable manifold as the graph of a mapping , whereas the lyapunov - perron method relies on a dynamical characterization of stable manifolds as a set of initial points for solutions decaying exponentially to the steady state .",
    "the method developed in this paper has features of both the hadamard and lyapunov - perron approaches . on the one hand ,",
    "the iteration scheme of the asm method can be treated as an implicit iteration scheme of the hadamard method . on the other hand ,",
    "the solution obtained by the asm method is a fixed point of the so - called truncated lyapunov - perron operator @xcite .",
    "we also show the relation between the lyapunov - perron approach and forward shooting method used for solving nonlinear rational expectation models @xcite and relaying on this explain the computational instability of the later .",
    "initially , the proposed method involves the same steps as perturbation methods @xcite ) : ( i ) find a steady state ; ( ii ) linearize the model around the steady state ; ( iii ) decompose the jacobian matrix at the steady state into stable and unstable blocks . the next step is to project the original system on the stable eigenspace ( spanned on the stable eigenvectors ) and the unstable one ( spanned on the unstable eigenvectors ) . as a result",
    ", the system will be presented by two subsystems interrelated only through nonlinear terms .",
    "these terms are obtained as residuals after subtraction of the linearized system from the original nonlinear one ; hence they vanish , together with their first derivatives , at the origin .",
    "such a transformation makes the obtained system convenient to take the next stage of the method .",
    "specifically , the approximate solutions are constructed by employing the convergence of solutions to the steady state and the contraction mapping theorem . in this way",
    "we obtain a sequence of policy functions of increasing accuracy in a nonlocal domain .",
    "the main results of the paper are theorem  [ thm1 ] and theorem  [ thm2 ] , which are proved in section  [ theory ] .",
    "theorem  [ thm1 ] establishes the existence of a sequence of approximate policy functions .",
    "theorem  [ thm2 ] estimates the accuracy of the approximate solutions and the following corollaries prove the convergence of the approximate policy functions to the true one in a definite nonlocal domain .",
    "thus , the result can be treated as a new proof of the stable manifold theorem @xcite .",
    "the proposed approach relates to the extended path method @xcite .",
    "specifically , under the assumption that the state variables are exogenous , at each point in time the solution of the extended path method applied to the transformed system lies on the corresponding asm . in this way the ep method can be easily put in the asm framework .",
    "@xcite mention that there is no proof that the ep algorithm converges to the true rational expectation solution .",
    "the ams method can be considered as a rigorous proof of convergence of the ep algorithm .",
    "indeed , theorems  [ thm1 ] and  [ thm2 ] can be applied directly for proving the convergence of the ep algorithm for the original ( non - transformed ) system .",
    "however , the use of linearization and spectral decomposition transforms the system into the form more convenient for verifying the conditions of the contraction mapping theorem .",
    "moreover , this gives us an advantage of the asm approach over the ep in terms of the speed of convergence to the true solution .",
    "this occurs due to the fact that the transformation makes the lipschitz constant for the mappings involved smaller in a set of neighborhoods of the steady state . exploiting the contraction mapping theorem",
    "also allows for obtaining the a priori and a posteriori approximation errors @xcite .",
    "the analogy with the ep method suggests that stochastic simulation in the asm approach can be performed much as in @xcite .",
    "an attractive feature of the method is its capability to handle non - differentiable problems such as occasionally binding constraints , for example , the zero lower bound problem .",
    "this feature results from the fact that the contraction mapping theorem requires a less restrictive condition than differentiability ; namely , this condition is the lipschitz continuity .",
    "the deterministic neoclassical growth model of @xcite , considered as an example to illustrate how the method works , shows that a first few approximations yield very high global accuracy . even within the domain of convergence of the taylor series the low - order asm solutions are more accurate than the high - order taylor series approximations .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section presents the model and its transformation into a convenient form to deal with . in section  [ theory ] our main results",
    "are stated and proved .",
    "section  [ ep ] establishes the relation between the proposed approach and ep method .",
    "the asm method is applied to neoclassical growth model in section  [ example ] .",
    "conclusions are presented in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "this paper is primarily concerned with the deterministic perfect foresight equilibrium of the models in the form : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is an @xmath2 vector of endogenous state variables at time @xmath3 ; @xmath4 is an @xmath5 vector containing @xmath3-period endogenous variables that are not state variables ; @xmath6 is an @xmath7 vector of exogenous state variables at time @xmath3 ; @xmath8 maps @xmath9 into @xmath10 and is assumed to be at least twice continuously differentiable .",
    "all eigenvalues of matrix @xmath11 have modulus less than one . in the same way as in the ep method of @xcite ,",
    "the vector @xmath6 can be treated as initial values of temporary shocks at the time @xmath3 .",
    "we define the steady state as vectors @xmath12 such that @xmath13 below , we also impose the conventional blanchard - kan condition @xcite at the steady state .",
    "the problem then is to find a bounded solution @xmath14 to for a given initial condition @xmath15 for all @xmath16 .",
    "by @xmath17 denote vectors of deviation from the steady state . linearizing ( [ eq:3 ] ) around the steady state , we get @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , are partial derivatives of the mapping @xmath8 with respect to @xmath21 , @xmath4 , @xmath22 , @xmath1 , and @xmath6 , respectively , at @xmath23 ; and @xmath24 is defined by @xmath25 the mapping @xmath24 is referred to as the nonlinear part of @xmath8 . by assumption on @xmath8 , the mapping @xmath24 is continuously differentiable and vanishes , together with its first derivatives , at @xmath26 . for the sake of simplicity",

    ", we do not have problems with zero - eigenvalues , because they correspond to identities that do not contain the terms with @xmath28 and @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , in what follows we assume that we have the representation of the original model in the form .",

    "therefore , the values @xmath277 equal the values of the mapping @xmath137 at the points @xmath265 . completing @xmath223 iterations of type ii results in @xmath278 where @xmath279 , @xmath280 , are the mappings that are defined by the following recurrent equations : @xmath281 where @xmath282 this recurrent sequence of mappings corresponds to with the assumption that the variable @xmath1 is exogenous .",
    "hence , theorems  [ thm1 ] and  [ thm2 ] can be applied straightforwardly for proving the convergence of the ep method . to the author",
    "s knowledge , until now there has been no proof that the ep algorithm converges to the true rational expectation solution to nonlinear models ( see concluding remarks in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the proposed approach can be considered as a rigorous proof that the ep algorithm converges to the true solution in a class of nonlinear models . moreover",
    ", the use of linearization at the steady state and spectral decomposition in the asm approach gives us additional advantages over the ep method in terms of the speed of convergence and size of the domain where the algorithms converge .",
    "indeed , the ep method can hardly be considered satisfactory in handling models with near - unit - root stable eigenvalues at the steady state ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "this occurs because if the jacobian matrix at the steady state has near - unit - root stable eigenvalues , then the lipschitz constant of the corresponding mapping exceeds one soon when the radius of neighborhood increases .",
    "the lipschitz constant greater than one does not allow for the convergence of the ep method in the domain by violating the assumption of the contracting mapping theorem .",
    "whereas in the asm approach under the transformation of the system , the jacobian matrix at the steady state is a zero matrix , thus the radius of the domain , where the lipschitz constant is less than one , is likely larger for the asm method than for the ep one .    taking into account the analogy with the ep method , stochastic simulation for the asm method can be done in the same way as in @xcite .",
    "namely , under a given initial condition @xmath283 and the assumption that the disturbances @xmath284 , @xmath103 , are equal to zero in all future periods , the deterministic system can be solved by the asm method described in section  [ theory ] .",
    "this solution also contains the next period initial condition for the variable @xmath22 . the next period initial condition for exogenous state variable @xmath285",
    "is obtained by drawing the stochastic disturbance @xmath286 .",
    "this provides the next period s control variable @xmath21 .",
    "iterating on this process yields a time - series realization of stochastic simulation .",
    "as the ep method the ams approach neglects jensen s inequality by setting future shocks to zero . nevertheless , as shown in @xcite ; and @xcite the error induced by this approximation of future shocks may be quite small .",
    "to illustrate how the presented method works we apply it to the simple deterministic neoclassical growth model of @xcite . consider the one - sector growth model with inelastic labor supply .",
    "the representative agent maximizes the intertemporal utility function @xmath287 subject to@xmath288 using the resource constraint to substitute out consumption , we have the following equilibrium condition : @xmath289 inverting ( [ 4.3 ] ) gives @xmath290 expressing @xmath291 as a function of @xmath292 and @xmath293 yields @xmath294 taking into account the steady state @xmath295 we get @xmath296 equation ( [ a7 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath297 it can easily be checked that the derivatives of @xmath8 at the point @xmath58 are @xmath298 therefore ( [ a8 ] ) takes the form @xmath299.\\label{a9 } \\end{split}\\ ] ] if we denote @xmath300 by @xmath301 , then ( [ a9 ] ) can be rewritten as the following system of equations : @xmath302 where the nonlinear term is @xmath303 rewriting ( [ a10 ] ) in the matrix form , gives @xmath304 where the matrix @xmath41 has the form @xmath305{ccc}0&1\\\\ -\\frac{1}{\\beta}&\\frac{1}{\\alpha\\beta}+\\alpha\\end{array } \\right).\\ ] ] next @xmath41 is transformed into jordan canonical form @xmath306 , where @xmath307{ccc}\\alpha&0\\\\ 0&\\frac{1}{\\alpha\\beta}\\end{array } \\right ) ,    z= \\left(\\begin{array}[c]{ccc}1&1\\\\ \\alpha&\\frac{1}{\\alpha\\beta } \\end{array } \\right ) ,   z^{-1}= \\frac{\\alpha\\beta}{1-\\alpha^2\\beta}\\left(\\begin{array}[c]{ccc}\\frac{1}{\\alpha\\beta}&-1\\\\ -\\alpha&1\\end{array } \\right).\\ ] ] after introducing new variables @xmath308{ccc}u_t\\\\ v_t\\end{array } \\right)=z^{-1}\\left(\\begin{array}[c]{ccc}{\\hat{k}}_{t}\\\\ { \\hat{z}}_{t}\\end{array } \\right)$ ] and premultiplying both side of ( [ a11 ] ) by @xmath48 , we can rewrite ( [ a5 ] ) as @xmath309 where @xmath310 and @xmath311 , where @xmath312 and @xmath313 are the components of the matrices @xmath46 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
