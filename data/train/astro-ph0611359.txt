    "the mechanisms responsible for transporting angular momentum in protostellar discs are still not well understood .",

    "the mri acts , essentially , by converting the free energy of differential rotation into turbulent motions that transfer angular momentum radially outward via the maxwell stress of small - scale , disordered magnetic fields .",
    "( @xmath1 ) vertical transport by outflows driven centrifugally from the disc surfaces ( e.g. knigl & pudritz 2000 ) .",
    "the transfer of angular momentum from the inflowing gas to the wind is mediated by a large - scale , ordered magnetic field that threads the disc ( likely corresponding to interstellar field lines advected inward by the accretion flow but possibly generated locally by a disc dynamo ) .",
    "radial angular - momentum transport has been the hallmark of generic viscous disc models , for which the mri process is thought to provide the most cogent physical basis . on the other hand , the ubiquity of bipolar outflows and jets in protostars and the apparent correlation between outflow and accretion signatures in these systems ( e.g. hartigan et al .",
    "1995 ) have led to the suggestion that disc outflows might be a key ingredient of the accretion process on account of the high angular - momentum transport efficiency of centrifugally driven winds ( e.g. knigl 1989 ) .",
    "the possibility of a central role for vertical angular - momentum transport is supported by recent _",
    "_ observations of protostellar jets , which have been interpreted in terms of magnetocentrifugal winds carrying a large fraction of the excess angular momentum of the accreted matter from the inner regions ( @xmath2au ) of the associated discs ( see ray et al .",
    "2006 for a review ) .",
    "although thermal pressure may contribute to the driving of the outflows ( e.g. pesenti et al .",
    "2004 ) , the stresses exerted by a large - scale magnetic field dominate the flow acceleration and collimation ( blandford & payne 1982 , hereafter bp82 ; see , however , soker & regev 2003 for an alternative view of the importance of thermal acceleration ) and are the key to the efficient vertical angular - momentum transport indicated by the _ hst",
    "_ measurements .",
    "previous analytic and numerical investigations have considered the above two mechanisms under various simplifying assumptions .",
    "mri studies have examined both the linear and nonlinear stages of the instability ( e.g. sano & stone 2002a , b ; salmeron & wardle 2003 , 2005 ) . the long - term global evolution of the instability in vertically stratified discs that are threaded by a single - polarity magnetic field is still an open question ( e.g. miller & stone 2000 ) .",
    "the study of wind - driving discs has been complicated by the need to solve simultaneously for the inflow and outflow structures and by the non - local nature of the mhd solution .",
    "progress has nevertheless been made semi - analytically by adopting a self - similarity formulation ( e.g. wardle & knigl 1993 , hereafter wk93 ; li 1995 , 1996 ; ferreira 1997 ) as well as numerically , with recent simulations reporting an evolution to a quasi - stationary state ( e.g. casse & keppens 2002 ; kuwabara et al .",
    "since protostellar discs are weakly ionized over most of their extent , magnetic diffusivity effects have to be taken into account in modeling the accretion flow in both cases .",
    "in particular , both the mri - driven turbulence and the centrifugal wind - launching mechanism require a minimum level of field ",
    "matter coupling to be effective ( e.g. wk93 ; sano & inutsuka 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , the detailed ionization structure and conductivity properties of the disc need to be determined in order to incorporate either one of these processes into a realistic model .",
    "angular momentum removal from real discs is likely to involve both the radial and vertical transport mechanisms discussed above .",
    "there have been a few attempts in the literature to construct quasi - steady disc models in which both of these mechanisms operate ( e.g. lovelace et al .",
    "1994 ; casse & ferreira 2000 ; ogilvie & livio 2001 ) , but these treatments invariably used a prescription for radial angular - momentum transport that did not explicitly account for its origin in mri - induced turbulence .",
    "however , the fact that disc regions in which the entire excess angular momentum is carried away by a centrifugally driven wind are generally stable to the fastest growing mode of the mri ( wk93 ) indicates that a more refined approach is required .",
    "broadly speaking , the mri is suppressed in regions where the ratio @xmath3 of the alfvn speed corresponding to the vertical field component @xmath4 and the isothermal sound speed is comparatively large ( @xmath5 ) ; it may be expected to evolve into a fully developed turbulence when @xmath6 ( provided also that the gas is well coupled to the field ) . since the value of @xmath0 increases with distance @xmath7 from the disc midplane",
    ", these considerations suggest that it could in principle be possible for both vertical and radial angular - momentum transport to take place at the same disc radius @xmath8 , with the radial transport confined to a given range in @xmath7 and with the vertical transport dominating at greater heights .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to construct semi - analytic models of protostellar discs that incorporate both centrifugally driven winds and mri - induced turbulence and to identify the relevant parameter regimes where either one of these two mechanisms dominates the angular momentum transport .",
    "we pay particular attention to the possibility that both of these mechanisms operate at the same disc radius and consider how they might affect each other in that case .",
    "we describe our wind - driving disc model ( formulated following wk93 ) and present an illustrative solution of a disc with a predominantly vertical angular momentum transport in section 2 . in section 3 we outline our method of including mri - induced turbulence ( taking account of recent numerical simulations of the nonlinear evolution of the mri ) and illustrate it with a solution of a disc with a predominantly radial angular - momentum transport .",
    "we then consider the case of combined transport by wind and turbulence in section 4 and summarize our results in section 5 .",
    "we have devised a general scheme for modeling wind - driving protostellar discs using a tensor - conductivity formalism and a realistic vertical ionization structure.au from the central object are nonthermal : interstellar cosmic rays , x - ray and uv radiation emitted by the magnetically active protostar and the decay of radioactive elements present in the disc .",
    "the gas near the disc surface is ionized primarily by x - rays in the vicinity of the star , and by uv photons ( with a contribution also from the interstellar radiation field ) in the outer disc ( e.g. semenov et al .",

    "the conductivity tensor makes it possible to include in a systematic way the three relevant magnetic diffusion mechanisms ( ambipolar , hall and ohmic ) .",
    "the solutions presented in this paper are , however , derived under the simplifying assumptions of pure ambipolar diffusivity and ( except in section 4 ) constant ion density .",
    "this enables us to apply the analytic results obtained for this case in wk93 to the formulation of a prescription for mri - induced turbulent transport in a wind - driving disc model .",
    "a wider class of solutions of our general scheme will be presented in future publications .",
    "our wind solutions are based on the magnetocentrifugal mechanism for `` cold '' disc outflows proposed by bp82 . in this scenario ,",
    "matter at the disc surface is accelerated by magnetic stresses if the open magnetic field lines that thread the disc are inclined at a sufficiently large angle to the rotation axis ( the `` bead - on - a - wire '' effect ) , potentially reaching super - alfvnic speeds .",
    "our modeling procedure is based on that of wk93 and we refer the reader to that study for further details . in brief , we solve the mass and momentum conservation equations for the neutral gas , and the induction equation for the evolution of the magnetic field , assuming a steady - state , geometrically thin and nearly keplerian accretion disc and neglecting all radial derivatives except that of @xmath9 . the disc is further assumed to be isothermal and weakly ionized .",
    "the latter condition implies that ionization and recombination processes , as well as the inertia and thermal pressure of the charged particles , have a negligible dynamical effect . in this limit ,",
    "separate equations for the ionized species are not needed , and their effect on the neutrals can be conveyed by means of a conductivity tensor @xmath10 ( assuming cylindrical polar coordinates ; see wardle 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , the field must satisfy @xmath11 ( which in the thin - disc approximation implies that @xmath4 can be assumed not to vary with height in the disc ) , whereas the current density @xmath12 must satisfy ampre s and ohm s laws .",
    "the foregoing equations are integrated vertically from the midplane ( indicated by a subscript @xmath13 ) up to the position @xmath14 of the critical ( sonic ) point , and the values of the physical variables there are estimated .",
    "the solution is then integrated backward to a fitting point and iterated until full convergence is reached .",

    "both of these solutions illustrate the main properties of wind - driving , strongly magnetized ( @xmath36 ) discs . in the quasi - hydrostatic layer just above the midplane the magnetic field lines are ( radially ) bent and ( azimuthally ) sheared and the field removes angular momentum from the matter .",

    "further support for this choice of an upper limit on @xmath0 in the mri - unstable region is provided by the fact that wind - driving disc solutions that satisfy the constraints expressed by equation  ( [ eq : ineq ] ) are _ stable _ to the fastest growing linear mode of the mri , essentially because the minimum wavelength of this mode exceeds the magnetically reduced disc scale height ( see wk93 ) . ) . ] the above limit on @xmath0 was applied by wk93 at the midplane , since they considered discs in which the entire excess angular momentum of the accretion flow is transported by a wind . as we are now concerned with the possible existence of an alternative mode of transport",

    "since our current formulation does not allow for an alternative means of transporting angular momentum through the disc surfaces ( such as magnetic braking , `` failed '' winds that do not cross the relevant critical surfaces , or nonsteady phenomena ) , the only remaining option is for the angular momentum to be transported magnetically between different heights and then to be carried away radially by bulk flow ( with the gas that loses angular momentum moving in and the material that gains angular momentum moving out ) .",

    "as an example , we use the normalizations of @xmath35 and @xmath95 given ( on a scale of @xmath132au ) by equations ( 3.50 ) and ( 3.51 ) , respectively , of wk93 and the radial scalings ( @xmath133 , @xmath134 , ion density @xmath135 ) corresponding to the asymptotic rotational core - collapse solution of krasnopolsky & knigl ( 2002 ) , which imply that @xmath136 drops below 1 at @xmath137au ( with disc winds dominating the angular momentum transport at larger radii and mri - induced turbulence turning on closer in ) .    the above example should , of course , be taken only as an illustration , since the radial parameter profiles in actual discs may be quite different . furthermore , as the density and column density in the disc increase with decreasing radius , the hall conductivity regime , and eventually also the ohmic regime , will be encountered ( e.g. balbus & terquem 2001 ) , with different regimes expected to dominate at different heights at any given radial location ( wardle 2004 ) .",
    "we are currently in the process of applying our general scheme to the investigation of the various conductivity regimes in realistic protostellar disc models .",
    "the results will be reported in future publications .",

    "<S> angular momentum transport in protostellar discs can take place either radially , through turbulence induced by the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) , or vertically , through the torque exerted by a large - scale magnetic field that threads the disc . using semi - analytic and numerical results , we construct a model of steady - state discs that includes vertical transport by a centrifugally driven wind as well as mri - induced turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> we present approximate criteria for the occurrence of either one of these mechanisms in an ambipolar diffusion - dominated disc . </S>",
    "<S> we derive `` strong field '' solutions in which the angular momentum transport is purely vertical and `` weak field '' solutions that are the stratified - disc analogues of the previously studied mri channel modes ; the latter are transformed into accretion solutions with predominantly radial angular - momentum transport when we implement a turbulent - stress prescription based on published results of numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze `` intermediate field strength '' solutions in which both modes of transport operate at the same radial location ; we conclude , however , that significant spatial overlap of these two mechanisms is unlikely to occur in practice . to further advance this study </S>",
    "<S> , we have developed a general scheme that incorporates also the hall and ohm conductivity regimes in discs with a realistic ionization structure .    </S>",
