    "the low energy limit of m - theory is eleven - dimensional supergravity .",
    "classically eleven - dimensional supergravity is unique .",
    "however off - shell , if we relax manifest lorentz - invariance , distinct variants exist @xcite .",
    "the manifestly lorentz - invariant variety commonly featured in the literature is responsible for much of what we know of m - theory , from the bps soliton spectrum to the embeddings of supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "yet it has a number of limitations which may lead one to search for an alternate low energy description .",
    "we shall now describe three features of m - theory that this sugra formulation does not capture .",
    "perhaps the most obvious is that it misses the @xmath0 super yang - mills which inhabits every boundary component of space - time @xcite , instead these must be added by hand . in particular if m - theory is compactified on a 4-manifold @xmath10 crossed with six - dimensional minkowski space crossed with an interval one finds an @xmath0 gauge bundle on each 10-dimensional end of the interval .",
    "these @xmath0 bundles are topologically specified entirely by their instanton numbers @xmath11 and @xmath12 on the two ends of the world .",
    "the ten - dimensional vector multiplet contains a weyl spinor and one must choose whether the spinors on the two ends have the same chirality as in fabinger - ho@xmath13ava @xcite or opposite chirality as in ho@xmath13ava - witten @xcite . in these two cases one finds that the instanton numbers obey ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the first pontrjagin class of @xmath10 .",
    "the second limitation arises from the fact that t - duality is obscured in 10@xmath16 sugras as the stringy modes are not included in the low energy effective theory .",
    "11-dimensional supergravity compactified on a 2-torus yields type  @xmath17 sugra compactified on a circle .",
    "this is the low energy effective theory of  string theory , and so when the radius @xmath18 of this circle is smaller than @xmath4 the  description must break down in favor of an equivalent dual  description compactified on a circle of radius @xmath19 .",
    "this transformation takes ns5-branes to kk - monopoles and more generally takes @xmath7-flux on the -side to curvature of the circle bundle on the -side as has been quantified in @xcite .",
    "the  theory comes with an elliptic fibration , where the fibers transform nontrivially as one encircles a d7-brane .",
    "a further t - duality transverse to this d7-brane yields a d8-brane in romans massive , a deformation of  supergravity not evident in the original 11-dimensional description .",
    "dirac quantization in abelian gauge theory is a consequence of the existence of the gauge bundle , which must have an integral chern class . in 11@xmath16 sugra , without mentioning 2-gerbes , such a topological explanation for the quantization of the four - form field strength is lacking .",
    "in particular the twisted quantization condition @xcite @xmath20 which holds for m - theory on any orientable @xmath21 manifold @xcite is mysterious .    in the future",
    "a formulation of 11@xmath16 sugra may be found in which the above m - theory features are manifest . as a possible preliminary step to such a program , in this note we will follow refs .",

    "of course one may always include such an auxiliary bundle as a bookkeeping device , and we will not address the critical question of what kind of dynamics it may have , if it has any dynamics at all",
    ". for example the bundle may be purely topological with propagating degrees of freedom appearing only holographically on the end of the world as in the proposal of ref .",

    "note for example that the final paragraph , on the quantization condition , is a trivial consequence of the construction ( [ const ] ) , the existence of the @xmath0 bundle , and the fact that characteristic classes are integral .",

    "we will use hull s proposal , which equates massive  string theory with m - theory compactified on a nilmanifold , to show that our claim implies an older conjecture @xcite that massive  naturally comes with a loop group of @xmath0 bundle centrally - extended by the romans mass .    several other applications of such @xmath0 s have been known for quite some time .",
    "for example diaconescu , moore and witten have used this @xmath0 bundle to calculate a topological phase in the m - theory partition function @xcite .",

    "a much more mysterious application predates m - theory .",
    "the dimensional reduction of 11@xmath16 sugra on @xmath23 is only equivalent to four - dimensional gauged supergravity after using the classical equations of motion .",
    "this means that the quantum version , whatever it may be , of the lorentz - invariant 11@xmath16 sugra does not reduce to the quantum 4@xmath16 sugra .",
    "clearly we would like m - theory to reduce successfully to the quantum gauged 4@xmath16 sugra .",

    "the relation of this @xmath24 to our compact @xmath0 is quite mysterious , although one might guess that at least the maximally compact @xmath25 s are the same .",

    "is not defined , and so these submanifolds are defects in the bundle .",
    "we say that defects constructed in this way are magnetically charged under @xmath36 and we interpret eq .",
    "( [ gauss ] ) as gauss law for measuring the magnetic charge linked by a @xmath38-sphere .",
    "these defects intersect the @xmath41-dimensional interior of the @xmath38-sphere at a discrete set of points and so they must be codimension @xmath41 , therefore the linking number with @xmath26 may be defined .",
    "in addition to magnetic solitons there are electric solitons whose charge we define with the hodge - dual gauss law @xmath42 where @xmath16 is the dimension of space - time and @xmath43 is contraction with the epsilon tensor .",
    "@xmath44 is a sphere that links an electric soliton , and so these solitons must be @xmath32-dimensional . in ordinary gauge theories purely electrically - charged objects",
    "do not correspond to nontrivial bundle configurations and must be added to the theory by hand . however in m - theory and string theories , due to chern - simons terms present in the low energy effective actions , it will be seen that magnetic solitons may carry electric charge and so electric solitons are automatically included in the classification of @xmath3 bundles .",
    "the above construction may be straightforwardly applied to classify the solitons of an @xmath0 bundle over an 11-manifold @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath0 is a simple lie group and so @xmath46 , however it is unique among semi - simple lie groups in that every other homotopy group up through @xmath47 is trivial .",
    "this means that the only magnetic solitons on an 11-manifold will be those arising from @xmath48 .",
    "these are the codimension 5 solitons whose charge is defined , via gauss law , by integrating the characteristic class @xmath49 over a linking 4-sphere .",
    "the division of @xmath15 by @xmath50 is canonically defined if m - theory is compactified on a @xmath21 manifold , as we will assume throughout this note .",
    "the image of the nontrivial map from @xmath51 to @xmath0 is homotopic to an @xmath52 in the @xmath0 , and so this construction remains valid if the @xmath0 gauge symmetry is broken so long as a nonabelian factor remains in which to embed this @xmath52 .",
    "if it is broken still further , a nonabelian factor must be restored in the region of this defect , that is at least one higgs field that breaks an @xmath52 must vanish in the defect s core .    if we interpret @xmath53 as the 4-form field strength of 11@xmath16 sugra , then these magnetic solitons are m5-branes @xcite .",
    "the shift by the first pontrjagin class of the tangent bundle , @xmath15 , is responsible for the shifted quantization condition which leads , for example , to the half - integral @xmath53 charges of the om5-plane .",
    "notice that any other semi - simple group would have additional nontrivial low - dimensional homotopy classes and thus additional magnetic solitons beyond the known soliton spectrum of 11@xmath16 sugra .",
    "one may imagine that 11@xmath16 sugra is somehow the dimensional reduction of the total space of this @xmath0 bundle , with many degrees of freedom missing or gauged away .",
    "motivated by this perspective one may formally define the `` size '' of the @xmath0 fiber over each point in space - time .",
    "if we wish to make our m5-branes nonsingular , the @xmath0 fiber , or more specifically the @xmath52 subgroup which is the image of the transition function @xmath29 , should degenerate over the m5 just as the circle fiber degenerates at a kaluza - klein monopole .",
    "of course in the classical supergravity solution m5-branes live at the end of an infinite throat and so the fiber never vanishes altogether .",
    "there is only one length scale in the theory , the planck length @xmath54 , and we define the size of the @xmath52 to be @xmath55 .",
    "the fact that the @xmath52 degenerates around the m5-brane suggests that the tension of the m5-brane depends entirely on @xmath54 , and so by dimensional analysis is proportional to @xmath56 , by analogy with the calculation of the tension of the kk - monopole .",
    "this interpretation has two attractive features .",
    "first , by having the effective plank scale shrink to zero around the m5-brane , so long as it shrinks quickly enough , the m5-brane is naturally at the end of a throat which is infinite in planck units , in accordance with the classical solution . secondly , at scales of order the plank scale the 11-dimensional picture breaks down as expected , this breakdown is a result of the kk - modes of the @xmath0 bundle which , as we will see when we consider a dimensional reduction , are m2-branes .",
    "we have found the objects magnetically charged under @xmath53 , the m5-branes . at this point",
    "we may , following the usual logic in gauge theories , introduce m2-branes by hand as electrically - charged matter",
    ". however m2-branes are already included due to a miracle of the chern - simons term @xmath57 in the 11-dimensional sugra action .",
    "this term ensures that an m5-brane wrapping the submanifold @xmath58 , being poincare dual to @xmath59 , has a worldvolume action containing the terms @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "the first term of the expression on the right indicates that m5-branes are electrically charged under @xmath62 .",
    "the second implies that in the presence of @xmath63 flux m5-branes also carry electric charge under @xmath63 , which is m2-brane charge .",
    "for example if an m5-brane wraps @xmath64 where @xmath51 bounds a 4-ball @xmath65 such that @xmath66 then @xmath67 and so the m5-brane carries @xmath32 units of m2-brane charge , and in fact may decay into @xmath32 m2-branes extended along the @xmath68 .    .",
    "this leads to a nontrivial @xmath0 bundle over every linking @xmath69 , characterized by a transition function @xmath70 .",
    "this transition function represents a nontrivial class in @xmath71 .",
    "a choice of @xmath72 in each @xmath69 is mapped to some basepoint in @xmath0 .",

    "@xmath0 approximates the classifying space @xmath76 and therefore the homotopy class of the map determines an element of the 3rd cohomology group of the m5-brane s worldvolume .",
    "this element is the worldvolume 3-form field strength @xmath77 , which is related to @xmath63 by a gauge transformation , and so the homotopy class of this map equals the m2-brane charge @xmath78 of the dielectric m5-brane.,width=288 ]    in sugra m5-branes may carry m2-brane charge as a result of the chern - simons term .",
    "we will now see that this effect of the chern - simons term is automatically built into the topology of the @xmath0 bundle .",
    "the above sugra construction of an m2-brane may be translated to a topological construction of the m2-brane as a defect in the @xmath0 bundle @xcite . following the previous paragraph",
    ", we begin with an m5-brane which wraps @xmath68 crossed with a contractible @xmath79 , as depicted in fig .",
    "this m5-brane is the codimension 5 magnetic defect of the @xmath0 bundle , and so any 4-sphere @xmath69 that links a point @xmath73 supports a nontrivial @xmath0 bundle with characteristic four - class equal to one .",
    "this non - trivial bundle may be trivialized over the northern and southern hemispheres of the 4-sphere , and so is characterized entirely by the transition function on the equatorial three - sphere @xmath80 .",
    "the transition function is a map @xmath70 and so is classified by @xmath46 .",
    "the m5-brane charge at the point @xmath81 is entirely specified by the homotopy class of this map because any map in its homotopy class may , by definition , be continuously deformed to any other such map .    while this deformation is possible at any single value of @xmath81 ,",
    "there is a global obstruction to performing such a deformation at every @xmath81 simultaneously .",
    "this is because globally the bundle carries yet another topological invariant besides the homotopy class of @xmath82 . to see this other invariant we continuously choose .",
    "as we will see , large gauge transformations _ can _ change the m2-brane change . ]",
    "a point @xmath74 on each 3-sphere @xmath80 .",
    "any such gauge choice yields a continuous map @xmath83 of basepoints of our transition function .",
    "this map , like @xmath82 , is topologically classified by @xmath46 and so provides the second invariant .    using the above sugra construction of dielectric m2-branes , we may see that this new integral invariant is m2-brane charge by showing that it is equal to the amount of @xmath53 flux on a 4-disk bounded by @xmath79 .",
    "this corresponds to a nontrivial bundle on the 4-disk , which may be constructed by partitioning the 4-disk into a core 4-disk which is surrounded by a 4-annulus .",
    "we will name the 3-sphere which separates the core from the annulus @xmath84 .",
    "the bundle over the 4-disk is then characterized by the transition function @xmath85 which , by our interpretation of @xmath53-flux , contribution may be ignored .",
    "this would not be possible , for example , if @xmath79 linked an om5-plane .",
    "this transition function is an example of the large gauge transformations mentioned in the previous footnote .",
    "] corresponds to the element @xmath86=k\\in\\pi_3(e_8)$ ] .",
    "if we shrink @xmath79 so that it lies within the core then @xmath87 is multiplied by @xmath88 and so the homotopy class of @xmath87 is augmented by the homotopy class of @xmath88 .",
    "thus the homotopy class of @xmath87 shifts by @xmath32 as the m5 sweeps out @xmath32 units of @xmath53 flux , which means that @xmath63 changes by @xmath32 units .",
    "as described above , @xmath63 measures the m2-charge and so the homotopy class of @xmath87 is equal to the m2 charge plus a constant .",
    "this seems to be the result that we sought , except that the integral of @xmath63 need not be integral and there is an undetermined constant .",
    "of course the homotopy class of @xmath89 is automatically integral and so the constant shift must save the integrality .",
    "this constant arises from m2-brane charge contributions from the bulk @xcite .",
    "when these are included one finds that the charge is always integral and in fact is equal to the integral of @xmath77 , the self - dual 3-form field strength which inhabits the worldvolume of the m5-brane .",
    "@xmath90 is the only gauge invariant quantity and when the integral of @xmath63 is an integer we may gauge transform it entirely into @xmath77 .",
    "however there are other gauges in which @xmath77 integrates to a different value , and so the m2-brane charge is not gauge - invariant .",
    "for example , imagine that space - time contains a non - contractible 4-sphere with @xmath32 units of @xmath53-flux",
    ". then @xmath63 can not be globally defined .",
    "however we may define it patchwise on the northern and southern hemispheres .",
    "we may then wrap an m5-brane around the equator @xmath79 .",
    "one may think of this m5-brane as an inhabitant of the northern or the southern patch , but these two answers give a different @xmath91 by @xmath32 units .",
    "@xmath90 is gauge invariant and so the integrals of @xmath77 and therefore the m2-charges must also differ by @xmath32 units .",
    "in fact , the m2-charge in such a background is only defined moduli @xmath32 as a result of a mms instanton @xcite in which @xmath32 m2-branes grow into an m5-brane which sweeps out the 4-sphere and then annihilates itself . the fact that this m5-brane loses its m2-charge is , if we replace the 4-sphere by @xmath92 , an m - theory lift of a freed - witten anomaly . thus we see that this particular freed - witten anomaly is built into the @xmath0 bundle formalism . for a less trivial example of a freed - witten anomaly manifested as an obstruction to the existence of the @xmath0 bundle see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have now seen that the @xmath0 bundle picture knows that m2-brane charge is not gauge - invariant , but rather may be gauge - transformed into integral @xmath63-flux . as a result , to discuss the tension of an m2-brane we will need to fix a gauge . to do this",
    "we will consider a dielectric brane which is an m5-brane wrapping a cycle @xmath79 which is much smaller than the scales of any fluxes or nontrivial cycles in the theory , and then we will take its size to zero .",
    "a natural gauge is thus one in which @xmath63 is well defined in the interior of @xmath79 , and so its integral over @xmath79 vanishes as the sphere is shrunk to zero .",
    "naively the tension of the m2-brane is just the tension of the m5-brane times the volume of the cycle that it wraps . in the spirit of considering a reduction from the total space of the bundle",
    ", we will formally define the volume of this cycle in the total space of the @xmath0 bundle so that this intuition holds . in the total space",
    "an m5-brane containing a single unit of m2-brane charge has a transition function @xmath89 which for any choice of basepoint @xmath74 wraps an @xmath52 in the @xmath0 once .",
    "we will interpret this as the m5 `` wrapping '' the @xmath52 once , and thus the volume of the m5 along the 3 compact directions is the volume of this @xmath52 , which we have defined to be @xmath55 .",
    "this gives an m2 tension that is equal to @xmath55 times the m5-brane tension , or @xmath93 . while the result is correct , this tension calculation is a very weak test of our viewpoint as @xmath54 is the only dimensionful quantity in our theory and so all tensions are already determined by dimensional analysis .",
    "when we turn our attention to type  this will no longer be the case .",
    "the ordinary formulation of 11@xmath16 sugra does not provide an origin for the @xmath0 bundles that inhabit each 10-dimensional boundary component of space - time .",
    "any 11@xmath16 @xmath0 bundle formulation is faced with the opposite problem , it must explain why the bulk @xmath0 gauge bosons do not appear to couple perturbatively to the familiar subset of the m - theory degrees of freedom .",
    "while this question is quite difficult to answer , a boundary @xmath0 bundle is easily produced in such a formulation .",
    "a 10@xmath16 @xmath0 gauge bundle on each boundary component may be constructed simply by restricting the 11@xmath16 @xmath0 gauge bundle to the boundary .",
    "the reduced supersymmetry on the boundary allows the gauge bosons to interact with the boundary degrees of freedom , and indeed each boundary component contains a weyl fermion charged under this @xmath0 .",
    "while this coupling is clearly allowed by 10@xmath16 @xmath94 susy on each boundary , the fact that it is actually manifested must be shown to be a consequence of any proposed dynamics for this @xmath0 bundle , as has been shown in the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite for fabinger - ho@xmath13ava compactifications .",
    "the restriction of the 11@xmath16 bundle to 10@xmath16 boundaries clearly gives an @xmath0 bundle , but one may wonder whether it gives the right @xmath0 bundle . in a sense this is trivial , as the construction ( [ const ] )",
    "appears to be the known anomaly cancellation condition for boundary fields from ref .",
    "of course this construction extends that relation to the bulk , but the fact that it agrees with the known relation on the boundary means that it must give the right boundary bundle .",
    "this picture is complicated by the choice of chirality of the weyl spinors on each boundary component . to see this",
    ", we will restrict our attention to m - theory compactifications on @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a compact 4-manifold and @xmath97 the interval .",
    "this space - time has two boundary components , which are copies of @xmath98 .",
    "if the same chirality is chosen on both components then eq .  ( [ const ] ) is indeed the boundary anomaly - cancellation condition .",
    "we may then use stoke s theorem to count the difference between the instanton numbers @xmath11 and @xmath12 on the two boundaries @xmath99 the second step follows from the fact that the topology of @xmath96 is independent of the position on @xmath97 , and so the integral of the characteristic class @xmath100 is equal on both sides .",
    "thus the difference between the number of instantons on the two ends of the world is equal to the number of m5-branes in the bulk , as expected in the theory with fabinger - ho@xmath13ava boundary conditions .",
    "if we want to flip the chirality of the weyl spinor on one of the sides , the correct boundary condition on that side is not eq .",
    "( [ const ] ) but rather its mirror image @xcite @xmath101 where we have used the fact that parity is only an invariance of the 11@xmath16 sugra action if the sign of @xmath53 is flipped at the same time .",
    "@xmath102 is the curvature of the @xmath0 gauge bundle after the action of this parity symmetry .",
    "if we wish to obtain the correct anomaly cancellation condition , we need to couple the opposite chirality fermions to the @xmath0 bundle with a parity flip in the bundle , which may be equivalent to a parity - flipped coupling to the original bundle .",
    "this places a constraint on any proposed origin of the fermions , although perhaps the coupling of the opposite chirality spinor to the opposite parity bundle is not a very strong restriction .",
    "once ( [ const2 ] ) is imposed the known instanton relation for the ho@xmath13ava - witten boundary conditions is automatic @xmath103 this identifies the sum of the instanton numbers as the usual factor that depends on the topology of @xmath96 minus the number of the instantons which have been pulled into the bulk , where they are m5-branes .",
    "the loopgroup of the group @xmath3 , named @xmath104 , is the group of closed loops in @xmath3 or equivalently the group of maps from the circle to @xmath3 . in this subsection",
    "we will review the fact @xcite that configurations of @xmath3 bundles over @xmath105 specify @xmath104 bundles over @xmath10 , and so one may dimensionally reduce a @xmath3 gauge theory on a circle by replacing @xmath3 with its loopgroup , @xmath104 .",
    "the converse is not true , there are @xmath104 bundles over @xmath10 that can not be lifted to @xmath3 bundles over @xmath105 . in the current context",
    "we will see that such  configurations which have no m - theory lift suffer from the freed - witten anomaly , as has been described for example in @xcite",
    ".    we will be interested in a slightly more general case in which the original space - time is not necessarily a product @xmath105 geometrically or topologically , but rather a circle bundle @xmath106 over @xmath10 . in this case",
    "the loop group bundle must contain the data describing the connection of this circle bundle .",
    "this is done by centrally extending the loopgroup by a circle .",
    "topologically this just means that our loopgroup @xmath2 is the product of the free loopgroup described above with a circle @xmath107 intuitively this central - extension circle is just the original circle fibered over @xmath10 , in fact the connection of this circle bundle is the same before and after the reduction .",
    "we will later generalize this construction to allow the circle to be nontrivially fibered over the free loopgroup , and we will argue that in  the chern class of this nontrivial bundle is the romans mass @xmath108 .    to summarize , for every @xmath3 bundle @xmath109 over a circle bundle @xmath106 over @xmath10 we want to use all of the data of both bundles to create an @xmath2 bundle @xmath8 over @xmath10 , where @xmath2 is the trivially centrally - extended free loopgroup of @xmath3 @xmath110 both bundles may be constructed by trivializing over patches and then determining transition functions .",
    "in the first case there are two types of transition functions , one for each of the bundles : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the intersection of two local patches of @xmath10 , where the transition functions are defined . from these two functions",
    "we must make the transition functions of the second bundle @xmath113 the transition function @xmath88 is just the direct sum of two functions , one from @xmath112 to @xmath104 and another from @xmath112 to @xmath114 .",

    "loopgroups are in general infinite - dimensional . but this does not imply that there will be an infinite number of massless gauge bosons . on the contrary , the photons corresponding to nontrivial loops will acquire masses by the usual kaluza - klein mechanism because they correspond to derivatives with respect to the reduced circle .",

    "in addition the extra factor in @xmath122 from the central extension leads to a 2-form characteristic class @xmath129 , which is just the field strength for the kaluza - klein @xmath130 gauge field .",
    "thus the homotopy groups of @xmath2 are exactly what they need to be to reproduce the known field content of the kk - reduced theory .",
    "one may reproduce the same results in a third way , by considering the effect of dimensional reduction upon the solitons of the @xmath3 gauge theory .",

    "the unwrapped reductions have the original tension , the wrapped reductions have a tension which is higher by the radius @xmath18 of the compactified circle , and the kk momentum modes are particles of mass @xmath134 .    in the case of m - theory there is only one length scale , which we use to define the `` size '' of the minimal 3-cycle in the @xmath0 fibers .",
    "this scale is the inverse of the membrane tension , and so in m - theory the electric solitons have a tension equal to inverse volume of the cycle with which they are made .",
    "the magnetic solitons , m5-branes , have a tension equal to the size of the minimal cycle , with a factor of @xmath135 to fix the dimensions .",
    "thus the product of the electric and magnetic tensions is the constant @xmath135 .",
    "every time that we reduce on a circle of radius @xmath18 , the resulting electric and magnetic pairs consist of one of the original solitons wrapped on the circle and its dual not wrapped .",

    "the original minimal @xmath32-cycle becomes a @xmath32-cycle and a @xmath125 cycle whose volume is @xmath134 of the volume of the @xmath32-cycle .",

    "here we have abused our notation by referring to a space - time circle , which is not the @xmath0 circle , as @xmath177 .",
    "this is because it will become the @xmath0 circle in massive , @xmath223 after two t - dualities .",
    "such a configuration , after dimensionally reducing on @xmath139 , is  compactified on @xmath224 with @xmath225 t - dualizing on @xmath153 yields a  configuration with @xmath226 and further t - dualizing with respect to @xmath177 yields a massive  configuration with @xmath227 . from now on we will drop the factor of @xmath228 in @xmath108 . the goal of the present section is to see what this chain of dualities does to our @xmath0 bundle , which will teach us the @xmath0 bundle realization of massive .",
    "in fact we will show something slightly more general .",
    "we will consider a configuration with d7-branes in  and t - dualize it to create d8-branes in .",
    "we will consider boundary conditions such that one side of each brane carries flux and the other does not . to obtain the above t - duality between  with @xmath229 flux and massive  with @xmath108 flux one may simply restrict attention to the side of the branes with the flux by moving the branes away to infinity on the fluxless side .      .",
    "@xmath32 d7-branes are located at a fixed point @xmath230 in the @xmath177 direction and are linked by the two circles @xmath231 , which are the base of a nontrivial @xmath147 f - theory torus bundle .",
    "if there is a trivial bundle over one of these circles then the other must support a nontrivial bundle , where the monodromy is the composition of @xmath32 @xmath9-transformations in @xmath207 .",
    "reducing away the bundle s base @xmath177 , the base is interpreted as the @xmath0 circle @xmath162 in the @xmath1 fiber over @xmath152 .",

    "we expect the t - dual to a d7-brane to be a d8-brane , and so @xmath232 bundle configurations appear to classify massive  solitons with romans mass @xmath233.,width=432 ]    the t - duality between a d6-brane in  and d7-brane in  has already been described in sec .",
    "[ exsec ] , and so we may begin already in .",
    "we consider type  compactified on @xmath219 , with @xmath32 d7-branes localized at a point @xmath234 .",
    "if we wish to return to a d6-brane configuration in  we will need to t - dualize along a circle that is wrapped by @xmath235 d7-branes , which is necessarily a circle action on the @xmath152 . the dimensional reduction to the 9-dimensional space of orbits of this circle action is the base space of an @xmath1 bundle , and the orbits of the circle are the fibers of the @xmath0 circle in this @xmath1 .",
    "this @xmath1 can be lifted to an @xmath0 bundle over an 11-dimensional torus bundle over @xmath152 .",
    "instead we will be interested in a t - duality with respect to @xmath177 , whose dimensional reduction will give a _",
    "@xmath1 bundle from the aforementioned dimensional reduction with respect to a circle action on @xmath152 .",
    "this may lead in particular to a distinct f - theory realization of this  configuration , despite the fact that the monodromies of the torus are determined by the @xmath229 fluxes and therefore must be the same in any f - theory lift of a  configuration . in particular whether a d3-brane `` wraps '' the f - theory torus appears to depend on whether the circle - action that we t - dualize preserves the embedding of the d3-brane .",
    "the 2-torus bundle over any loop @xmath114 is characterized by the monodromy about that loop . in backgrounds like ours where the dilaton is single - valued the monodromy is always some composition of @xmath9-transformations determined by the integral of the rr field strength @xmath229 over the loop @xmath236 in our case , sketched in fig .",
    "[ d7d8 ] , the @xmath32 d7-branes are linked by @xmath231 , the disjoint union of two copies of @xmath177 . the bundle over the cylinder orthogonal to the d7-branes",
    "is then characterized by the @xmath229 flux integrated over these two circles .",
    "these fluxes must both integrate to integers ( times @xmath228 ) or else the partition function of a d(-1)-brane or d - instanton would be ill - defined , corresponding to the fact that @xmath237 is an element of @xmath207 only when @xmath32 is integral .",
    "we will consider the simplest case , in which the integral of @xmath229 over one circle is trivial , yielding the trivial bundle .",
    "the difference between the two integrals , by gauss law , is equal to the d7-brane charge linked .",
    "thus @xmath229 integrated over the second circle is equal to @xmath238 , providing a monodromy of @xmath237 as the f - theory torus is pushed around this loop .",
    "dimensionally reducing this configuration on @xmath177 we might hope to find an @xmath1 bundle over @xmath152 , but in fact we find something slightly different .",
    "as expected our fiber has three circles , the  circle which we will call @xmath162 and also the two circles from the f - theory torus which we call @xmath139 and @xmath153 .",
    "however in contrast with the usual topology of @xmath1 , the torus is nontrivially fibered over @xmath162 producing a nilmanifold . in the dimensional reduction procedure that we have defined lower - dimensional cycles do not affect higher - dimensional cycles in the reduced theory , and so the two and three - cycles of @xmath1 appear to be in tact .",
    "one might already guess that a nontrivial bundle over @xmath162 in the 9-dimensional picture leads to a nontrivial bundle over the two - sphere @xmath239 from which it arises in the 10-dimensional type  picture , where we have unreduced with respect to @xmath153 .",
    "after all if we take the @xmath153 from the torus fiber and reinterpret it , using the smash product @xmath240 , as part of the base then we find precisely this bundle over the @xmath241 .",
    "while `` unreducing '' may not be well - defined , we will support this conjecture by starting with a centrally extended @xmath6 bundle over 10-dimensions and reduce to obtain the variant of @xmath1 just described .",
    "we start in  with a stack of @xmath32 8-branes .",
    "on one side of the 8-branes is an @xmath6 bundle , on the other side is an @xmath232 bundle where @xmath32 is the central extension of the affine @xmath0 .",
    "topologically the lie group @xmath232 is identical to the trivially centrally - extended @xmath242 except that the central extension @xmath139 is nontrivially fibered over the nontrivial 2-sphere @xmath239 with chern class @xmath32 .",
    "the fibration of these bundles over the base will not be important for the present discussion , we will see that @xmath108 is determined solely by the internal structure of the @xmath232 fiber .",
    "of course this is in accord with the fact that @xmath108 is a space - time zero - form .",
    "the @xmath139 bundle over @xmath165 is the @xmath32th tensor power of the hopf fibration . rather than",
    "treat this bundle directly , we will find it to be slightly easier to introduce an auxiliary bundle over the two - torus @xmath243 , also with chern class equal to @xmath32 .",
    "the smash product @xmath244 provides a projection map from the torus onto the sphere and the bundle over the torus is the pullback under @xmath245 of the bundle over the sphere .",
    "this is , not accidentally , the same strategy we used with the space - time torus when we dimensionally reduced a configuration with a d6-brane .",
    "the bundle over the torus is the @xmath32th tensor power of the poincare bundle , and so the construction of the space of flat connections @xmath162 of the @xmath139 bundle over @xmath246 is just the restriction map .",
    "that is , for each @xmath247 the corresponding flat connection is the subbundle over @xmath248 .",
    "in particular the point @xmath249 corresponds to loop @xmath248 pushed forward by the smash product @xmath245 into @xmath6 . to save notation",
    "the other coordinates in the @xmath6 group manifold have been omitted in the preceding interpretation of the points @xmath250 in the @xmath0 circle @xmath162 .",
    "in particular as one encircles @xmath162 , the loops @xmath251 sweep out all of @xmath243 . if one considers a section of the @xmath139 bundle over @xmath251 and pushes @xmath250 around @xmath162 once one necessarily finds that this section now winds @xmath32 more times around @xmath139 .",
    "thus the monodromy about @xmath162 is the action @xmath237 on the torus @xmath252 .",
    "@xmath246 parametrizes the circle in the definition of the loop group @xmath1 , and so parametrizes @xmath153 .",
    "thus it is the torus @xmath147 that undergoes the monodromy of @xmath237 as one circumnavigates @xmath162 in this variant of @xmath1 .",
    "this is precisely the relation that characterized the variant of @xmath1 found above by dimensionally reducing a circle in type  that supports @xmath229 flux .",
    "this identifies our variant of @xmath1 as @xmath253 , and leads us to conjecture that @xmath253 bundles over 9-dimensions characterize massive  compactified on a circle ) to verify that it has the expected homotopy groups . ] . unreducing the circle",
    "@xmath153 we appear to find that configurations of uncompactified massive  are classified by @xmath232 bundles over space - time .",
    "such bundles have no obvious 11-dimensional lift , rather the 11th dimension @xmath139 is hopelessly entangled with the @xmath0 coordinates , being fibered over the @xmath239 .",
    "however if there are two free circle actions available then such a configuration is related by dimensional reductions and unreductions to an @xmath0 bundle compactified on a twisted 3-torus .",
    "we have missed the most interesting cases , t - duality on circles which are allowed to degenerate .",
    "we hope that any insight this may give into mirror symmetry may allow for real calculations , which after all should be the goal of this program .",
    "in particular the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ kurv ] ) to the case in which the circle bundles may degenerate is unknown .",
    "a more straightforward project would be to generalize this construction to the t - duality between the heterotic theories and to type i and i@xmath254 , as the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ kurv ] ) is unknown even there .",
    "using the above definition of f - theory the torus consists of two space - like circles and so there is no second time .",
    "this is not problematic as one does not need to suggest that the low energy description is a 12-dimensional supergravity . on the contrary , as one of the f - theory directions is t - dual to a space - time direction the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite may imply that to obtain a classical description one must choose a gauge , which appears to be an 11-dimensional projection of this 12-dimensional space .",
    "thus while supersymmetry and even lorentz invariance may not be manifest in the 12-dimensional description , it is enough that they appear in our gauge choices .",
    "the notion that minimal cycles in the fiber have a `` size '' may be a formal bookkeeping device to keep track of the tensions of the electrically charged solitons .",
    "but the picture in which solitons are somehow lifted into the total space of the bundle does seem to reproduce the dielectric effects caused by worldvolume couplings .",
    "this leads one to wonder whether worldvolume actions may thus somehow be written as jacobian determinants of such embeddings .",
    "in particular the m2-brane action , at least in superspace , is perhaps the simplest place to start .",
    "however if one wishes to take these fiber directions seriously , it may be essential that some mechanism , generalizing the gauge - fixing described in the last paragraph , allows one to eliminate the gravitational degrees of freedom that might otherwise deform them .",
