    "a higgs boson ( @xmath1 ) was discovered at the lhc run - i in 2012  @xcite . after the discovery",
    ", further precision measurements have revealed its properties , which seem to be quite consistent with those of the higgs boson in the standard model ( sm ) within current experimental errors  @xcite . by measuring the mass of the higgs boson very precisely , @xmath2  gev at the lhc  @xcite , the parameters in the higgs potential in the sm",
    "have been determined experimentally .",
    "however , the whole structure of the higgs sector is still unclear , since one can consider models with extra scalar fields , like the higgs sector in the supersymmetric models , satisfying all the available constraints including the properties of the discovered @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , in fact , numbers of models with extra scalar fields have been proposed to solve the problems which can not be explained within the sm , such as neutrino masses , dark matter , baryon asymmetry of the universe , cosmic inflation , etc .",
    "determining the structure of the higgs sector experimentally becomes an important foothold in constructing the new theory above the electroweak scale .    for this purpose ,",
    "further precision measurements are required to pin down small deviations from the sm in the properties of @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "this shall be performed at the lhc run - ii with increased energy and more accumulated luminosity , and also at the future lepton colliders , such as the international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite , the future circular collider ( fcc )  @xcite , and the compact linear collider ( clic )  @xcite . by measuring deviations from the sm in the properties of @xmath1",
    ", one can probe an extended higgs sector with rather large masses of additional higgs bosons so that effects by the extended part in the higgs sector tend to decouple from the properties of the sm - like @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "another approach to elucidate the whole structure of the higgs sector is to directly search for additional higgs bosons , since their existence must be a clear evidence of an extended higgs sector .",
    "direct searches of additional higgs bosons have been performed at the lhc run - i in various decay modes  @xcite , and the limits on the mass of additional higgs bosons and their coupling strength have been investigated . on the prospect of the direct searches at future colliders ,",
    "the lhc run - ii has an advantage since it is the energy frontier experiment which is good to produce heavier particles .",
    "however , on the other hand , direct searches at the ilc have a different advantage , that is , a parameter regions with relatively small cross section can be probed due to the clean environment of lepton collider experiments , although the mass reach for additional higgs bosons is relatively limited .",
    "thus , the searches at the lhc run - ii or its luminosity upgraded version with 3000  fb@xmath0 ( lhc  3000  fb@xmath0 ) and the ilc can be complementary to servey the wide parameter regions in extended higgs sectors  @xcite .    in this paper , we study multi - top - quarks events as distinct signals of production of additional higgs bosons . as benchmark models of extended higgs sectors , we consider two higgs doublet models ( 2hdms ) . in the 2hdm , there are @xmath3-even @xmath4 , @xmath3-odd @xmath5 , and a pair of charged @xmath6 in addition to the sm - like @xmath1 . for neutral @xmath4 and @xmath5 ,",
    "the decays into a top - quark pair open if their masses are larger than about 350  gev .",
    "because of the large mass of the top quark , it is quite possible that this decay mode dominates the branching fraction at least in certain regions in the parameter space .",
    "thus , the multi - top - quarks events can be an attractive signal of the heavy higgs bosons .",
    "such multi - top - quarks events have been studied at the lhc as a signal of new particle in various models  @xcite",
    ". a large production rate of multi - top - quarks events is predicted at the lhc for the models with colored new particles such as gluinos , color - octet scalars , etc . , but that for non - colored particles such as heavy additional higgs bosons is limited . at the ilc ,",
    "four top - quarks production can be considered as a signal of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , through @xmath7 and @xmath8  @xcite . to produce a pair of @xmath4 and @xmath5 which decay into top - quark pairs , both the masses of @xmath4 and @xmath5 are required to be larger than about 350  gev , and",
    "the collision energy should be higher than about 700  gev .",
    "such an experiment can be realized at the ilc with @xmath9  tev .",
    "up to our knowledge , there has been no dedicated study on this process at lepton colliders .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we aim to present a detailed analysis on this process including the hadron - level simulation with jet clustering , flavor tagging , detector acceptance and momentum resolution effects .",
    "we find that the four top - quarks events can be detected by simple kinematical cuts , and thus be useful to survey the parameter regions in the 2hdm .",
    "we note that the signal of heavy charged higgs boson can be @xmath10 , and its observability has been studied in @xmath11 process at hadron colliders  @xcite , and also at lepton colliders in @xmath12 and @xmath13  @xcite .",

    "the obtained discovery reaches at the lhc and at the ilc are compared .",
    "[ sec : dis ] is devoted to discussions for further investigation and future prospects .",
    "finally , we draw a conclusion in sec .  [",
    "sec : conc ] .",
    "in this section , we briefly introduce the model we consider , namely the 2hdm with the softly - broken @xmath14 symmetry .",
    "we introduce two isospin doublet scalar fields , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which transform as @xmath17 and @xmath18 under the @xmath14 transformation . for the sm fermions ,",
    "there are four kinds of @xmath14 parity assignment  @xcite , as listed in table  [ tab : z2 ] .",
    "we denote the four types of yukawa interactions as type - i , type - ii , type - x and type - y  @xcite .",
    "the yukawa interaction to the sm fermions in each flavor is allowed for only one higgs field , @xmath15 or @xmath16 , to make each interaction term @xmath14 invariant .",
    "it forbids the flavor changing neutral currents at the tree - level  @xcite , which are severely constrained by experimental observations .",
    ".four possible @xmath14 charge assignments to the scalar and fermion fields . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     first , we describe our simulation analysis for the detection of the 4 top - quarks events at the ilc with @xmath9  tev .",
    "we use madgraph5  @xcite and pythia6  @xcite for generation of signal and background events , with tauola  @xcite for tau lepton decays . we evaluate the signal process by including both the single and pair production amplitudes coherently . the sm contribution to the @xmath19 process is estimated to be very small , giving @xmath20  fb at @xmath9  tev .",
    "thus , for the integrated luminosity of @xmath21  ab@xmath0 , only a few events are expected to be produced in the sm .",

    "the other background processes are negligible .    to analyze the gererated events , we follow the designed performance of the ilc detectors  @xcite .",
    "we take all detectable particles whose pseudo rapidity satisfies @xmath32 . for charged particles ,",
    "we further require their transverse momentum satisfies @xmath33  gev .",
    "four momenta of those particles are smeared by using the gaussian distribution with @xmath34 for charged particles , @xmath35 for neutral hadrons , and @xmath36 for photons , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are given in an unit of gev .    among those particles , we select isolated leptons , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , whose energy satisfies @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are given in an unit of gev .",
    "@xmath44 is the summation of energies of particles inside the cone around the lepton defined as @xmath45 except the lepton itself  @xcite .",
    "after removing the isolated leptons from the list of particles , we perform a jet clustering by using the durham algorithm  @xcite with fixed @xmath46 with the help of fastjet  @xcite .",

    "first , we discuss the mass reconstruction of additional higgs bosons in the decay mode into a top - quark pair . at the lhc , even if some excess in the events for the lepton plus multi - jets channel is observed , the mass reconstruction of additional higgs boson is difficult , since one has to form an invariant mass of six jets in the pretense of more jets which come from the top quarks and the isr / fsr jets . the combinatorial uncertainty and the jet energy resolution prevent us from constructing a clear peak in the invariant mass distribution . at the ilc ,",
    "the mass reconstruction by kinematical methods is still difficult , because of the combinatorial uncertainty and the fact that the top quarks from the decay of additional higgs bosons with the mass of 350 - 500  gev have relatively low velocity .",
    "thus , for the mass determination , we may rely on the other decay modes , accompanied to the @xmath66 mode , such as @xmath124 and @xmath125  @xcite .    since the enhancement of the couplings of @xmath4 and @xmath5 to top quarks is true for the all four types of yukawa interactions , the discrimination of the type of yukawa interactions needs to see the other decay modes , such as @xmath126 for type - ii and type - y and @xmath125 for type - ii and type - x . for type - i , the other decay modes are all suppressed .",
    "therefore , non - observation of the other fermionic channel may be the signature of type - i .",
    "for the above two reasons , combinations of the searches of additional higgs bosons in different decay modes are important . depending on the type of yukawa interactions and the value of @xmath102",
    ", the decay modes into @xmath124 and @xmath125 can be explored at the lhc and/or the ilc  @xcite . by observing several decay modes and their event rates ,",
    "@xmath102 can be determined experimentally  @xcite . in the case of @xmath127 ,",
    "the decay modes of @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath113 , and @xmath115 can be sizable , especially for type - i . by the combinations of the measurements of these modes , experimental determination of @xmath130 may be performed .",
    "finally , we give some comments on the searches at the clic  @xcite . at the clic",
    ", the collision energy of multi - tev , such as 3  tev , is proposed . with @xmath131  tev",
    ", the mass reach would be extended up to about 1.5  tev .",
    "this is totally above the scope at the lhc .",
    "thus , the direct searches at the clic would have a great impact in any decay mode of additional higgs bosons .",
    "the top quarks from the decay of such heavier higgs bosons are more energetic so that the mass reconstruction by using boosted top - jet measurement can be realistic . in the case that @xmath4 and @xmath5 are produced with large velocity , the decay products of each higgs boson are well separated into different hemispheres . therefore , the mass of additional higgs boson can be reconstructed by using the invariant mass of all decay products in one hemisphere  @xcite .",
    "we have studied the direct searches of the additional higgs bosons in multi - top - quarks events at the future lhc and the ilc experiments .",
    "additional higgs bosons are predicted in any kind of models with extended higgs sectors , and the detection of them at colliders is a clear signature of the physics beyond the standard model . as a benchmark model of the extended higgs sector , we have considered the two higgs doublet models with discrete symmetry with four types of yukawa interactions .    at the lhc , the signals of four top - quarks events suffer from systematical uncertainties of estimating the sm backgrounds .",
    "therefore , the searches can only survey the parameter regions with @xmath120 which is disfavored by experimental constraints from flavor physics without adding new particle contents to the model . at the ilc",
    ", although the mass reach is almost limited by its beam energy , we have shown that the parameter regions with @xmath132 - 15 can be surveyed depending on the type of yukawa interactions .",
    "we have also discussed that further investigation may be performed at the ilc , such as discrimination of the type of yukawa interactions and determination of the mass of additional higgs bosons by combining the observations of the other decay modes of @xmath4 and @xmath5 in addition to the @xmath66 mode .",

    "<S> we study direct searches of additional higgs bosons in multi - top - quarks events at the lhc run - ii , its luminosity upgraded version with 3000  fb@xmath0 , and the international linear collider ( ilc ) with the collision energy of 1  tev . </S>",
    "<S> additional higgs bosons are predicted in all kinds of extended higgs sectors , and their detection at collider experiments is a clear signature of the physics beyond the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> we consider two higgs doublet models with the discrete symmetry as benchmark models . </S>",
    "<S> if these additional higgs bosons are heavy enough , the decay modes including top quarks can be dominant , and the searches in multi - top - quarks events become an important probe of the higgs sector . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the discovery reach in the parameter space of the model , and find that there are parameter regions where the searches at the lhc with 3000  fb@xmath0 can not survey , but the searches at the ilc 1  tev run can . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of direct searches at the lhc and the ilc is useful to explore extended higgs sectors . </S>"
