    "the role of magnetic fields in the evolution of molecular clouds and the formation of stars has long been subject to great debate ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) . in a classic model of low - mass star formation ,",
    "molecular clouds are supported by magnetic fields , and stay in subcritical states , evolving quasi - statically ; ambipolar diffusion induces the formation of supercritical cores which dynamically collapse to form stars @xcite .",
    "the other view is that molecular clouds are short lived , dynamically evolving , and producing stars rapidly @xcite , with magnetic field being implicitly weak , or not really appreciable in cloud evolution and star formation ; mac low and klessen ( 2004 ) further strongly argue that supersonic turbulence , instead of magnetic field , supports molecular clouds and regulates star formation . on the other hand ,",
    "our understanding of high - mass star formation is far less clear , but the competing views on the role of magnetic field / turbulence are equally , if not more strongly debated .",
    "recent magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations suggest that magnetic fields are dynamically important in high - mass star formation , in particular at suppressing complete fragmentation and creating bipolar outflows @xcite .",
    "the `` magnetic support '' model predicts a well - ordered or , in the extreme case , uniform magnetic field permeating a molecular cloud @xcite . since there is an increased support against gravity in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field compared to the direction parallel to it , the cloud contracts more along the field , forming flattened cores orthogonal to the mean direction of the field @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the `` weak field '' or `` turbulent support '' model , magnetic field is expected to show an irregular and even chaotic morphology due to overwhelming turbulent twisting @xcite . therefore , mapping the morphology of magnetic field provides a straightforward method to distinguish between the two competing paradigms , or to provide insights into the possibility of a scenario where both magnetic field and turbulence are important . focusing on massive clumps or cores with a typical size scale of 0.1  pc and a distance of a few kpc , high - angular - resolution observations of polarized dust emission",

    "strong polarization of the dust emission ( signal - to - noise ratios greater than 3 ) is detected toward mm1 , mm3 , and part of mm2 ( figure [ pol_mag]a ) , and thus the inferred b field in the plane of sky is well resolved ( figure [ pol_mag]b ) . we detect a clearly ordered b field threading the clump . over the northern two cores mm1 and mm3 ,",

    "therefore , over mm1 and mm3 , the b field in the dense clump is approximately perpendicular to the mean direction of the large scale b field , while toward mm2 , the b field in the clump roughly follows that in the cloud .",
    "in addition , to the southwest of mm1 and to the east of mm2 , there are b field segments inclined to the direction of the cloud b field . even for the northern part of the clump , the direction of the b field on the edges of the clump tends to deviate more from the clump major axis .",
    "our sma observations cover a large number of spectral lines tracing molecular gas under a variety of physical conditions .",

    "there is a clear velocity gradient across the two condensations in the first moment map and @xmath19 diagram of the hc@xmath23n ( 3837 ) emission .",
    "we also investigated our sma 230  ghz observations , and found a similar velocity structure along the clump .",
    "the dense gas kinematics and the b field morphology both suggest that the clump can be understood as a two - component structure : the northern part , which consists of mm1 and mm3 , exhibits a velocity gradient of order 50  kms@xmath7  pc@xmath7 , and the mean direction of the b field is aligned with the long axis of the clump ; the southern part , i.e. , mm2 , does not show a clear velocity gradient , and the b field direction is perpendicular to the clump axis , such that it is aligned with the b field in the cloud .",

    "consequently we can estimate the energy ratio of the turbulence to the ordered b field , @xmath61 , to be 0.71.9 .",
    "the ratio is somewhat overestimated considering that we are probing the b field in the plane of sky and @xmath31 is not necessarily all ascribed to turbulence .",

    "the clump consists of three cores , mm13 , each of which harbors a couple of dust condensations . toward mm2 and mm3 ,",
    "early nh@xmath23 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) observations deduced a rotational temperature of 2025  k , corresponding to a kinetic temperature of 3040  k @xcite . toward mm1",
    ", our lte model of the ch@xmath23cn ( 1918 ) @xmath27-ladder gives a temperature of 135  k for the embedded hmcs , while recent high - angular - resolution nh@xmath23 observations suggest a temperature @xmath64  k @xcite .",
    "thus we adopt a gas temperature of 50135  k for mm1 . assuming thermal equilibrium between gas and dust , the derived gas temperature approximates the dust temperature .",
    "the dust opacity index , @xmath65 , is derived by comparing the dust emission fluxes at 880  @xmath11 m and 1.3  mm ( the latter is obtained from our new sma observations ) .",
    "the dust opacity at 880  @xmath11 m is then extrapolated from 10@xmath66^{\\beta}$ ] , where @xmath67 is frequency , following hildebrand ( 1983 ) . assuming a canonical gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100 , the masses of the three cores are then computed from their dust emission fluxes ( table [ table2 ] ) .",
    "the total mass of the clump amounts to @xmath68  @xmath69 , and results in an averaged column density of @xmath70  @xmath71 over a measured area , @xmath72 , of 200 square arcsec ( 0.015  pc@xmath73 ) where the emission is detected with signal - to - noise ratios above 5 .",
    "if we adopt a volume of @xmath74 , the averaged volume density is @xmath75  @xmath76 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath770.9  mg , again depending on @xmath43 .",
    "consequently , the mass - to - magnetic flux ratio , @xmath78 , is 1.93.2 in units of a critical value , @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the gravitational constant @xcite , indicating that the clump is unstable against gravitational collapse and fragmentation    it has been shown that a star - forming cloud generally collapses to a flattened or filamentary configuration to allow efficient fragmentation to follow @xcite .",
    "the observations of the g35.2n clump is consistent with this theoretical prediction . to further understand the fragmentation property of the clump , it is instructive to compute the thermal jeans mass , which is about 1.5  @xmath69 at a density of @xmath81  @xmath76 and a temperature of 30  k. the analyses of the gravitational instability of molecular gas sheets and filaments by larson ( 1985 ) are probably of more relevance to g35.2n .",
    "larson ( 1985 ) argued that rotation and magnetic field do not fundamentally change the characteristic mass , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the gas temperature and @xmath11 is the surface density in @xmath84 , of the fragments . for g35.2n , @xmath85 . even without taking into account the mass of the forming stars and of the gas already dispersed by the wide - angle outflow , the clump mass is orders of magnitude greater than the jeans mass or @xmath86 , and is expected to fragment into hundreds of density enhancements if the dynamics is solely controlled by the gravity and thermal pressure . in figure",
    "[ cont]c , there are only six prominent condensations detected at a spatial resolution ( 0.01  pc ) finer than the jeans length ( 0.04  pc ) .",
    "we also perform a multi - component gaussian fitting to the dust emission using the miriad task imfit , and identify three new possible condensations , mm1c , mm2c , and mm2d ( see figure [ imfit ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the total number of the condensations is far less than what is expected in thermal fragmentation .",
    "such observational results have been seen in some other high - mass star - forming regions @xcite , and strongly suggest that other mechanisms , e.g. , turbulence , magnetic field , and rotation , are playing important roles in the dynamical evolution of the clump . a highly _ turbulent _ core with a radius of 0.1  pc and a mass of @xmath87 , as described by zhang et al . ( 2013 ) in applying the model of mckee & tan ( 2003 ) to g35.2n , is obviously inconsistent with the high - angular - resolution observations obtained here with the sma and with the alma @xcite .",
    "recent numerical simulations of the collapse and fragmentation of magnetized , massive star - forming cores show that cores with @xmath88 form a single star rather than fragmenting to a small cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is inconsistent with our observations either ; the measured @xmath78 in g35.2n is @xmath33 , and the clump is highly fragmented .",
    "we expect that both the b field and turbulence help to increase the effective jeans mass or the characteristic mass of the fragments , but neither ( or their combination ) is sufficient to completely suppress fragmentation on @xmath89  pc scales .",
    "the sub - parsec clump in g35.2n has been interpreted as a prototype of a massive interstellar disk or toroid , with the `` disk '' being nearly edge - on , having lsr velocities increasing from northwest to southeast @xcite .",
    "our observations provide significantly new insights into the dynamics of the clump .",
    "going from the northern to the southern part of the clump , the b field direction takes a @xmath1 turn and is correlated with the velocity field revealed by the high - density tracing molecular lines ( see section [ kinematics ] ) .",
    "we also find that the b field in the southern part appears to be slightly pinched and can be fitted with a set of parabola ( figure [ hourglass ] ) , which provides marginal evidence for a magnetically regulated collapse of mm2 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figure",
    "[ imfit ] , the dust condensations in the northern part are distributed approximately along the major axis of the clump , while those in the southern part have a trapezium - like distribution .",
    "all this suggests that the clump is composed of two dynamically different components rather than coherently rotating as a whole .",
    "one interpretation of the observed velocity gradient in the northern part of the clump is that it arises from the rotation of the dense gas .",
    "considering the orientation of the b field in the cloud revealed by the single - dish observations ( see figure [ pol_mag]b ) , we speculate that the dense clump forms as the cloud collapses more along the direction of the large scale b field . in this dynamical process , the dense gas breaks into two parts . the northern part carries over most of the angular momentum that is not dissipated and forms a fast rotating system .",
    "the system could be a rotating toroid embedded with multiple fragments .",
    "or it is a hierarchical structure consisting of two cores ( mm1 and mm3 ) in an orbital motion , and each core further fragments and collapses into a binary or multiple star . in the latter case ,",
    "the projected separation of @xmath90  pc and the line - of - sight velocity difference of @xmath91  kms@xmath7 between mm1 and mm3 yield a dynamical mass of @xmath92 , which is compatible with the combined mass of the two cores ( table [ table2 ] ) .",
    "the southern part , however , does not participate in the rotating motion and is expected to have a mean velocity similar to that of the parent cloud .",
    "this hypothesis is indeed supported by the large scale kinematics seen in @xmath20co ( 10 ) observations obtained from the galactic ring survey , from which an lsr velocity of 35.2  kms@xmath7 is derived for the ambient cloud of g35.2n ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* also see figure [ gradient ] ) .",
    "also , one may expect that the angular momentum in the northern part has a significant influence on the fragmentation , causing the resulted fragments to be distributed within the rotational plane .",
    "the observed morphology of the b field in the clump can be naturally incorporated in the above scenario .",
    "figure 9 provides an overall picture of our interpretations of the b field structure : in the northern part , the b field is pulled by the rotation into a _ toroidal _ configuration , whereas in the southern part , the b field is only gently squeezed by the collapse and remains to be in a _",
    "configuration ( aligned with the b field in the cloud ) .",
    "we quantitatively investigate the feasibility of our interpretation of a rotationally distorted b field in the northern part of the clump . according to matsumoto et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , a @xmath1 misalignment between the axis of an outflow and the mean direction of an ordered b field may occur if the rotational energy is at least comparable to the magnetic energy ( also see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "assuming the measured velocity gradient , @xmath93 , in the northern part of g35.2n is arising from a disk - like structure with a diameter @xmath94 , the rotational energy amounts to @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the mass of the rotating structure .",
    "the averaged ratio of the rotational energy to the magnetic energy , @xmath97 , is found to be 0.51.3 for an end - to - end velocity difference of @xmath98  kms@xmath7 and @xmath770.9  mg .",
    "hence the rotational energy does appear to be comparable to the magnetic energy .",
    "alternatively , if a b field is wound by rotation into an overwhelmingly toroidal configuration , the centrifugal force is presumably overcoming the magnetic force .",
    "more quantitatively , machida et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that whether the centrifugal force or the magnetic force regulates the evolution of a collapsing core can be evaluated by the ratio of the angular velocity to the magnetic field strength , @xmath99 .",
    "if this ratio exceeds a critical value , @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the sound speed , the centrifugal force dominates the dynamics . for the g35.2n clump , @xmath102  year@xmath7 and @xmath103  kms@xmath7 at 30  k , leading to @xmath104@xmath105 yr@xmath7@xmath11g@xmath7 , which is on the same order but lower than the critical value of @xmath106 yr@xmath7@xmath11g@xmath7 .",
    "we stress that both @xmath107 and @xmath101 are averaged over the entire clump . toward the inner part of the clump , @xmath107 increases since the cores appear to rotate faster , and @xmath101 also increases since the gas temperature is higher .",
    "thus the measured @xmath99 would be greater than the critical value .",
    "for example , considering the dense gas in mm1 , @xmath107 measures @xmath108  year@xmath7 ( figure [ gradient]f ) and @xmath101 reaches 0.71  kms@xmath7 ; the measured @xmath99 is more than 2 times greater than the critical value , confirming that the centrifugal force is dominating over the magnetic force .",
    "the above calculations show that energy - wise , the b field is likely to be significantly distorted by the rotation .",
    "but , is there sufficient time for a toroidal b field to develop ?",
    "the rotation period , @xmath109 , is estimated to be @xmath110  yr . the dense clump with an averaged density of @xmath81  @xmath76 presumably form from a cloud with a lower density ( @xmath111  @xmath76 ) , which has a free - fall time @xmath112  yr .",
    "in addition , with the detection of hmcs and a radio source in mm1 , it is feasible to expect that the clump has a dynamical age of order @xmath113  yr ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the rotation has proceeded for a few periods , and significantly distorted the b field into a predominantly toroidal configuration .",
    "finally , another piece of evidence supporting for the presence of a toroidal b field in the clump comes from polarization observations ( @xmath114 resolution ) of oh maser emission ; hutawarakorn & cohen ( 1999 ) detected a few zeeman pairs within @xmath26 of mm1b and found that the direction of the b field along the line of sight reverses from the southeast to the northwest of mm1b , and the direction reversal was interpreted as being due to a toroidal b field .",
    "both well - collimated and wide - angle outflows have been seen in high - mass star - forming regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here in g35.2n , the co ( 76 ) observations reveal a parsec - sized wide - angle outflow ( figure [ outflow ] , also see figure [ cartoon ] ) .",
    "the outflow appears to originate from one of the two hmcs ( mm1a or mm1b , see section [ hmc - outflow ] ) , which must have been undergoing collapse and spun up to form a rotating disk at the center . indeed , there is evidence for the presence of a rotating disk in mm1b from the alma observations @xcite , though it is yet to be confirmed whether the outflow is driven from mm1b . in line with our above interpretations , the ambient b field of the inner @xmath115  pc part of the outflow",
    "is dominated by a toroidal component , and that component could be further traced down to a 0.01  pc scale taking into account previous oh maser observations @xcite . thus the wide - angle outflow is most likely associated with a strong toroidal b field .",
    "how is this outflow driven ?    bipolar outflows in protostars or young stars",
    "are believed to be magnetically driven . in the most quoted magneto - centrifugal wind theory ,",
    "the outflowing gas is centrifugally ejected , either from the inner edge of an accretion disk or over a wide range of disk radii , along open poloidal field lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the magnetic tower model suggests that an outflow is accelerated by the magnetic pressure gradient of a wound - up volume of a toroidal b field @xcite .",
    "many mhd simulations of collapsing magnetized cores have shown that a bipolar outflow is launched from a strongly rotating region when a predominantly toroidal b field has been built up by the collapse - spin up process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observations of g35.2n are apparently consistent with such a scenario .",
    "furthermore , numerical simulations often found two - component outflows : a larger , low - velocity , and less collimated outflow emerging earlier than an inner , faster , and jet - like outflow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while some claim that the former is a magnetic tower flow and the latter is launched by the magneto - centrifugal force @xcite , others argue for an opposite view @xcite",
    ". the situation can be even more complicated considering possible dependence of the outflow morphology on the b field strength ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , radiation pressure could be important in widening massive outflows @xcite .",
    "thus we are not able to infer the driving mechanism of the g35.2n outflow solely based on its morphology .",
    "regarding the b field morphology , existing observations suggest a strong toroidal component in the inner part of the outflow , but a poloidal component certainly exists . to determine whether a magnetic tower or the centrifugal force dominates the acceleration of the outflowing gas , one may need a complete knowledge of three - dimensional b field and velocity structures @xcite . since we are only probing the b field projected in the plane of sky , and",
    "the estimate of the b field strength is indirect , it is not possible to compare the toroidal to poloidal components in detail .",
    "hence whether or to what extent a magnetic tower plays a role in accelerating the outflow remains open .",
    "but if the growing tower is important , the central collapse - spin up process significantly helps to create at least part of the observed toroidal b field .",
    "provided the remarkable filamentary morphology of the clump seen in figure [ cont]c , it is likely that we are observing a dense gas cylinder .",
    "a gas cylinder may fragment along its major axis due to the `` sausage '' or `` varicose '' instability , and the resulted fragments will have a characteristic spacing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in fgiure",
    "[ imfit]a , the dust condensations in the northern part are nearly equally spaced , in qualitative agreement with the fragmentation of a cylinder . since a cylinder / filament",
    "is not expected to be rotating too fast about its minor axis , the observed velocity gradient ( @xmath116  kms@xmath7pc@xmath7 ) is most likely arising from an infall motion along the cylinder axis rather than from a rotation . from figure [ gradient]d ,",
    "the infall velocity is @xmath62/sin@xmath117  kms@xmath7 , where @xmath117 is the inclination angle of the cylinder with respective to the plane of sky . for a cylinder with a mass of @xmath118 ( roughly the gas mass of the northern clump plus the mass of the forming stars ) and a length of 0.1  pc ,",
    "the line - of - sight component of the free - fall velocity reaches @xmath119  kms@xmath7 , which is not incompatible ( e.g. , for @xmath120 ) with the observed velocity gradient .",
    "however , in the scuba map ( figure [ cont]a ) , the clump is much less elongated , and on a larger scale , we do not detect any filamentary structure where the cylinder is embedded .",
    "furthermore , self - gravitating cylinders have a critical linear mass density , @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the sound speed @xmath101 in case of thermal support @xcite or the turbulent velocity dispersion @xmath58 in case of turbulent support @xcite . above the critical value",
    ", the cylinder would radially collapse into a line .",
    "the b field can somewhat increase the critical linear mass density , but probably by small factors @xmath2 @xcite . for g35.2n ,",
    "the measured linear mass density is of order @xmath123 ( without taking into account the mass of the forming stars and of the gas already dispersed by the outflow ) , which is about two times greater than the critical value of @xmath124 .",
    "unless the cylinder is largely inclined to the line of sight ( i.e. , @xmath125 ) , the linear mass density seems to be too high to allow a stable cylinder to exist .",
    "also , the southern part of the clump , which appears very different from the northern part in the b field , kinematics , and fragmentation properties , can not be easily incorporated in a unified picture of a cylinder .",
    "considering all these difficulties in understanding the observed clump as a cylinder , the interpretation of a rotating system ( section [ winding ] ) for the northern part of the clump appears more robust than that of a collapsing cylinder .",
    "with the sensitive and high - angular - resolution observations made with the sma , we detect a well - ordered b field threading g35.2n , which is an apparently filamentary , massive , and cluster - forming clump .",
    "based on a statistical analysis of the observed polarization dispersion , we derive a b field strength of @xmath2  mg , a turbulent - to - magnetic energy ratio of order unity , and a mass - to - magnetic flux ratio of @xmath33 times the critical value .",
    "the b field morphology is found to vary depending on the kinematics revealed by high - density tracing molecular lines . in the northern part of the clump , which exhibits a velocity gradient , the b field",
    "is largely aligned with the long axis of the clump ( hence follows the velocity gradient ) . approaching the southern part , which has a relatively uniform velocity field",
    ", the b field takes a great turn of @xmath1 to a direction perpendicular to the clump elongation .",
    "although we can not rule out the possibility that the velocity gradient is due to an infall motion along a gas cylinder , a synthesis of all the available observations prefers a rotating motion to be the origin of the velocity gradient .",
    "consequently the b field in the northern part is pulled by the centrifugal force into an overwhelmingly toroidal configuration , whereas the b field in the southern part remains in a poloidal configuration , that is , aligned with a large scale b field which guides the collapse of the cloud from which the clump forms .",
    "therefore we are likely witnessing a transition from a poloidal to toroidal configuration for the b field in this region .",
    "detailed calculations adopting the b field strength derived from the statistical analysis supports such a scenario .",
    "our observations also provide evidence for a wide - angle outflow driven from a strongly rotating region whose b field is largely toroidal .",
    "last , but not least , the supercritical clump is observed to be significantly fragmenting , but to a degree far from expected for a purely thermal fragmentation .",
    "our observations and calculations suggest that both the b field and turbulence , as well as the potential rotation , all play a role in interplaying with the gravity and shaping the dynamical evolution of the clump .",
    "part of the data were obtained in the context of the sma legacy project : `` filaments , magnetic fields , and massive star formation '' ( pi : qizhou zhang ) .",
    "we acknowledge all the members of the sma staff who made these observations possible .",
