    "the definition of particle states is at the very heart of contemporary quantum theory of fields .",
    "it takes its origin from the frame - independent casimir invariants of the poincar group as was first realized by wigner in his work of late thirties @xcite . on that ground ,",
    "quantum states of free particles in a poincar covariant framework are characterized by _",

    "wigner postulated that particle states transform as _ classical _ unitary , and therefore infinite - dimensional , representations of the poincar group .",
    "later on , weinberg argued @xcite that _ quantized _ non - unitary finite - dimensional representations can also be given particle interpretation , once unitarity of the corresponding quantized field operators is ensured .",
    "in the context of the existing baryonic spectra , we shall establish the thesis that within the above - indicated framework one obtains not only unique spin eigenstates , which can be identified with particles , such as neutron , proton , etc .",
    ", but also multi - spin mass - degenerate clusters .",
    "we will present a data - supported new interpretation of the rarita - schwinger fields which reveals a well - defined pattern in the masses , spins , and parities of the nucleon- , @xmath0- , and @xmath1-hyperon excitations and it allows to probe the scale of the chiral phase transition for baryons .",
    "it can be directly verified that the symmetric ( right - handed ) @xmath18 , and antisymmetric ( left - handed ) @xmath19 combinations of angular momentum , @xmath20 , and boost , @xmath21 , generate two independent left - handed ( l ) and right - handed ( r ) su(2 ) algebras @xmath22 obviously , it is possible to define the sets of right- and left - handed states , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , respectively , such that @xmath25 equations ( [ left_right ] ) suggest to use @xmath26 and @xmath27 as labels for lorentz multiplets according to @xmath28 .",
    "the dimensionality ( @xmath29 ) of @xmath28 is now given by dim=@xmath30 .",
    "the most interesting @xmath28 states are those where either @xmath26 or @xmath27 vanishes , i.e. the @xmath31 and @xmath32 states , and with @xmath33 .",
    "we denote those fields in turn by : @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . as long as for such fields",
    "@xmath36 is true in a spin - independent manner for all @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the boost generator turns out to be particularly simple and related to @xmath20 via @xmath39 consequently , @xmath40 for @xmath37 , while @xmath41 for @xmath38 .",
    "the momentum dependence of the left - handed and right - handed fields is then determined through the action of the boost onto the rest - frame fields as @xcite @xmath42 here , @xmath43 stands for the boost direction , while @xmath44 is the boost parameter . as long as no skew sense can be defined at rest , @xmath45 and @xmath46",
    "are indistinguishable ( up to a phase factor that will be ignored for the time being @xcite ) and one can write @xmath47 in inverting then , say , the first one of eqs .  ( [ boosted_lr ] ) , one finds @xmath48 which , after insertion into the second of the eqs .",
    "( [ boosted_lr ] ) yields the relation @xmath49 similarly , one finds @xmath50 the coupled equations ( [ l_r_coupl ] ) and ( [ r_l_coupl ] ) completely determine equation of motion and propagation of the @xmath51 fields . to be specific",
    ", we will illustrate this statement on the example of the spin-1/2 field , where @xmath52 with @xmath53 being the set of the well known three pauli matrices . in this case",
    ", one has @xmath54 in using the taylor - series expansion for the hyperbolic trigonometric functions and accounting for the circumstance that @xmath55 , the equation set in ( [ coupl_eqs ] ) takes the form @xmath56 finally , insertion of the relations , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , into eqs .",
    "( [ pre_dirac ] ) leads to @xmath59 this set of equations can be cast into the matrix form @xmath60 which is nothing but the dirac equation , @xmath61 , in the weyl representation .",
    "equations  ( [ pre_dirac ] ) and ( [ weyl_eqs ] ) show that the _ linearity _ of the dirac equation is due to the fact that @xmath62 . in general @xcite ,",
    "the order of the differential equations for spin-@xmath63 particles is @xmath64 and is related to the fact that @xmath65 is the highest power of the momentum that appears in the expansion of @xmath66 .",
    "the general consequence is that the equation of motion for single higher - spin states are inevitably higher - order differential equations .",
    "now , in what follows , we shall focus onto the properties of the boost generator and reveal need for an inherent handedness of the lorentz multiplets .",
    "due to the non - vanishing commutator @xmath67 , the boost is in general non - diagonal in the quantum number of spin .",
    "in addition , in transforming as an ordinary polar vector , the boost behaves @xcite as a 1st - rank spherical tensor , @xmath68 , and connects opposite parity states with spins differing by either zero , or , by one unit .",
    "the non  vanishing matrix elements of @xmath69 are determined as @xmath70 while those of the ladder boost - generators , @xmath71 , are given by @xmath72 here @xmath73 stands for the parity , and @xmath74 and @xmath75 are parameters defined as @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are in turn the minimal and maximal spin within the representation considered . to be specific , for the right - handed @xmath79 state one",
    "has @xmath80 while for the left - handed @xmath81 state @xmath82 .",
    "equation  ( [ bst_mael ] ) shows that if the boost is to be diagonal in spinor space and have non - vanishing matrix elements of the type @xmath83 have to be parity mixed states .",
    "this is the meaning of `` handedness '' . as an example one may think of the @xmath84 multiplet that can be associated with the electromagnetic field strength tensor in the massless limit .",
    "this multiplet has the symmetric @xmath85 and antisymmetric @xmath86 combinations of the vector electric ( @xmath87 ) and pseudovector magnetic ( @xmath88 fields as underlying right - handed @xmath89- and left - handed @xmath90 spin-1 states , respectively .",
    "the lessons to be learned from the above considerations are two : ( a ) classical single - spin - j lorentz multiplets carry an inherent handedness that requires two states of opposite parities as ingredients , and ( b ) such states are described by partial differential equations of the order @xmath64 .      a method for treating higher - spin states that is different from the one presented in the previous section was initiated by weinberg around mid sixties @xcite .",
    "weinberg suggested to consider linear differential equations for finite - dimensional non - unitary representations of the lorentz group that are described in terms of totally symmetric traceless rank-@xmath91 lorentz tensors with dirac spinor components , i.e. fields of the type @xmath92\\ , .",
    "\\label{rs_fields}\\ ] ] these fields satisfy the dirac equation for each lorentz index @xmath93 the simplest field of the type in eq .",
    "( [ rs_fields ] ) , with @xmath94 , was considered more than two decades earlier by rarita and schwinger @xcite and applied to the description of a spin-3/2 particle . in general , all fields of the type in ( [ rs_fields ] ) will be referred to as rarita - schwinger ( rs ) fields .",
    "the rs fields are conglomerations of fermions of different spins and parities .",
    "this statement is best illustrated at the level of the group o(4 ) , the wick rotated compact form of the lorentz group . in noticing that the bosonic as well as the fermionic part of the rs field are constructed out of parity - mixed fields , one can pick up and consider for the sake of concreteness , the coupling of , say , a positive parity dirac fermion to an o(4 ) boson composed of o(3 ) states of either natural @xmath95 , or , unnatural @xmath96 ) parities .",
    "these o(3 ) states , which can be viewed as mass degenerate , carry all integer internal angular momenta , @xmath17 , with @xmath97 and transform with respect to the space inversion operation @xmath98 as @xmath99 in coupling now the positive - parity part of the dirac spinor to @xmath100 from above , the spin ( @xmath101 ) and parity @xmath102 ) quantum numbers of the baryon resonances are created as @xmath103 in the following , we will use for the spin - sequence in eq .",
    "( [ coupl_scheme ] ) the short - hand notation @xmath104 , with @xmath105 standing for the isospin of the states considered , and @xmath106 .",
    "equation ( [ parity ] ) shows that @xmath107 directly relates to the principal quantum number of the coulomb problem .",
    "the states of different spins and opposite parities that accompany the highest - spin state of any @xmath108- , and , consequently , of any rs field , serve an important purpose .",
    "they prevent that the boost generator vanishes within the multiplet under consideration . to illustrate this statement , let us consider as a simple example the bosonic part @xmath109 of the rs field with @xmath94 which is the source of the spin-@xmath110 companions of the spin-@xmath111 field . from eq .",
    "( [ bst_mael ] ) follows that the boost generator @xmath69 mixes the o(3 ) scalar and vector subspaces of @xmath112 as the only non - vanishing matrix elements of @xmath69 in this multiplet are @xmath113 from this , and @xmath114 , the parameter @xmath115 is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ laj_dzj ] ) as @xmath116 . in this way the standard representation of the @xmath69 matrix in the @xmath117 space is obtained as @xmath118",
    "since lorentz and spinor indices of the rs fields always factorize , the boost of this representation space is most naturally obtained in boosting its bosonic part independently from the fermionic one .",
    "equations ( [ bst_mael ] ) and ( [ ladder - boost ] ) , in combination with eqs .  ( [ parity ] ) and ( [ coupl_scheme ] ) ,",
    "clearly illustrate that the presence of the lower - spin components of a rs cluster guarantee in a simple manner its covariance with respect to lorentz transformations .",
    "note that for rs- , as well as @xmath119 fields , both @xmath69 and @xmath120 are non - vanishing .",
    "now , weinberg s suggestion was to consider the lower - spin components of the rs fields as redundant , unphysical states that have to be projected out by a set of suitably chosen lorentz covariant auxiliary conditions . in doing so",
    ", one eventually would describe a baryon of single spin-@xmath121 and _ fixed parity _ as the highest - spin state of the @xmath122 field and use the linear differential equation ( [ rs_fields ] ) .    when applied to the @xmath123 field ,",
    "the auxiliary conditions eliminate eight degrees of freedom , usually associated with the lower spin-@xmath124 and spin-@xmath125 components from eq .",
    "( [ coupl_scheme ] ) .",
    "immediately , one notes that such a description is not necessarily compatible with the general nature of the boost generator in eqs .",
    "( [ bst_mael ] ) and ( [ ladder - boost ] ) .",
    "it is little wonder , that truncated rs fields suffer various pathologies ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "so one has to face the unavoidable conclusion of the principal difficulty to describe isolated higher - spin states of fixed parity in terms of linear differential equations .",
    "note , that the problem arose out of the tacit assumption that nature produces baryons as isolated higher - spin states .",
    "a glance at the baryon spectra teaches us that actually nature strongly favors the excitations of complete rs clusters over that of isolated higher - spin states .",
    "we now show that the new interpretation of the rs fields is supported by the data on baryonic spectra .",
    "one of the basic quality tests for any model of composite baryons is the level of reached in describing the nucleon and @xmath126 excitation spectra . in that respect ,",
    "the knowledge on the degeneracy group of baryon spectra appears as a key tool in constructing the underlying strong - interaction dynamics . to uncover it",
    ", one has first to analyze isospin by isospin how the masses of the resonances from the full listing in ref .",
    "@xcite spread with spin and parity .",
    "such an analysis has been performed in our previous work @xcite where it was found that breit - wigner masses reveal on the @xmath127 plane a well pronounced spin- and parity clustering .",
    "there , it was further shown that the quantum numbers of the resonances belonging to a particular cluster fit into lorentz group representations of the rs type . to be specific",
    ", one finds the three rs clusters with @xmath128 , and @xmath129 in both the nucleon @xmath130 and @xmath0 spectra . in terms of the notations introduced above ,",
    "all reported light - quark baryons with masses 2500  mev ( up to the @xmath131 resonance that is most probably an independent hybrid state ) , have been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite to be completely accommodated by the rs clusters @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 , having states of highest spin-@xmath111 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 , respectively ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "in each one of the nucleon , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 hyperon spectra , the natural parity cluster @xmath132 is always of lowest mass .",
    "it is considered to reside in a fock space , @xmath137 , built on top of a scalar vacuum . from eqs .",

    ", @xmath138 is followed by the unnatural parity clusters @xmath133 , and @xmath134 , which we view to reside in a different fock space , @xmath144 , that is built on top of a pseudoscalar vacuum . to be specific",
    ", one finds all the seven @xmath0-baryon resonances @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 from @xmath152 to be squeezed within the narrow mass region from 1900  mev to 1950  mev , while the @xmath153 resonances paralleling them , of which only the @xmath154 state is still `` missing '' from the data , are located around 1700@xmath155  mev ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "therefore , the f@xmath156 resonance is the only non - strange state with a mass below 2000 mev which is `` missing '' in the present rs classification scheme .",
    "further paralleling baryons from the third nucleon and @xmath0 clusters with @xmath157 , one finds in addition the four states @xmath158 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 with masses above 2000  mev to be `` missing '' for the completeness of the new classification scheme .",
    "the @xmath158 state is needed to parallel the well established @xmath159 baryon , while the @xmath0-states @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 are required as partners to the ( less established ) @xmath160(2100 ) , @xmath161(1900 ) , and @xmath162(2080 ) nucleon resonances . for @xmath163 hyperons , sparse data",
    "prevent a conclusive analyses .",
    "even so , see fig .  2 , the rs pattern is already apparent in the reported spectrum .    5.0 cm    the ( approximate ) degeneracy group of baryon spectra as already suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite and further justified here , is , therefore , found to be : @xmath164 , i.e. , isospin@xmath2space - time symmetry .    within our scheme , the inter - cluster spacing of @xmath165 to @xmath166  mev is larger by a factor of @xmath167 to @xmath168 as compared to the mass spread within the clusters .",
    "for example , the @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , and @xmath152 clusters carry the maximal mass splitting of @xmath172 to @xmath173  mev .",
    "the above considerations establish that :    1 .   observed excited light - flavor baryons preferably exist as multi - fermion clusters that are described in terms of the three rs multiplets @xmath138 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "the above rs clusters exhaust all the resonances observed in the @xmath174 scattering channel ( up to the @xmath131 state ) .",
    "they constitute an almost accomplished excitation mode in its own rights , as only 5 resonances are `` missing '' for the completeness of this structure .",
    "3 .   as long as the internal parity of the clusters changes from natural for the first one , to unnatural , for the subsequent two",
    ", the question arises whether this change signals a phase transition for baryons .",
    "next section is devoted to this problem .",
    "a conspicuous feature of the rs cluster excitation mode are the even @xmath107-values and the parity change when going from the first , @xmath138 , to the second and third rs clusters @xmath133 , and @xmath134 , respectively . in that regard",
    ", the absence of odd-@xmath107 clusters with parity that is opposite to the one of the observed even-@xmath107 clusters , needs explanation . a decomposition into rs clusters of the three - quark hilbert space , @xmath175 , with one excited quark at the @xmath176 orbits , revealed the principal possibility @xcite of having as an additional baryon excitation mode the @xmath177 , @xmath178 and @xmath179 rs cluster sequence with highest spins @xmath180 , @xmath181 , and @xmath182 , respectively .",
    "these resonance groups are characterized by parities that are opposite to the observed ones . their presence or absence",
    "probes the scale of the chiral symmetry realization in the light - quark baryon spectra .",
    "indeed , in case the nambu - goldstone mode of chiral symmetry that selects @xmath137 and natural parities , would extend for , say , the nucleon , to @xmath1831500 mev , one can not expect to find the unnatural parity @xmath184 cluster in that excitation domain . above 1600 mev , @xmath137 changes to @xmath185 . in case",
    "@xmath144 has been selected by a hidden mode of chiral symmetry , no natural parity clusters can occur above 1600 mev and @xmath178 and @xmath179 will be absent there .",
    "if , however , chiral symmetry above 1600 mev is realized in the manifest wigner - weyl mode , then the natural parity clusters @xmath186 and @xmath187 will show up .",
    "whatever the chiral symmetry mode above 1600 mev may be , the data strongly hint onto a parity change of the hadronic vacuum between 1550 mev and 1600 mev for nucleons .",
    "therefore , in that mass region one may expect at least a meta - stable co - existence of two parity degenerate vacua and there the occurrence of parity doublets can be expected . on the grounds of the analyses performed in ref .",
    "@xcite one expects a cluster that is described in terms of a totally antisymmetric lorentz tensor with dirac spinor components .",
    "such a cluster gives rise to spin-@xmath188 and spin-@xmath189 parity doublets .",
    "the scale of the chiral phase transition for nucleons is therefore predicted to be around 1600 mev .",
    "this means that opposite to the considerations of ref .",
    "@xcite , it is the @xmath190 resonance that , in being built on top of a @xmath191 internal boson degree of freedom , has to be considered as the `` would be '' parity partner of the nucleon and has to enter the linear sigma model with parity doublets .",
    "the s@xmath192 resonance used instead in @xcite has @xmath193 as internal orbital angular momentum and does not match with the scalar internal mode of the nucleon . in the context of the classification of baryons as rs clusters , states like the d@xmath194(1700 ) and p@xmath194(1720 ) , or ,",
    "the @xmath195 and @xmath196 resonances , do not pair , because , in belonging to the same rs cluster , their internal orbital angular momenta differ by one unit , instead of being equal but of opposite parities .",
    "the reported mass averages of the resonances from the rs multiplets with @xmath128 , and @xmath129 are well described by means of the following simple _ empirical _ recursive relation : @xmath197 where , again , @xmath198 .",
    "the two mass parameters take the values @xmath199  mev , and @xmath200  mev , respectively . the first term on the r.h.s . in eq .",
    "( [ balmer_ser ] ) is the typical difference between the energies of two single particle states of principal quantum numbers @xmath107 , and @xmath201 , respectively , occupied by a particle with mass @xmath202 moving in a coulomb - like potential of strength @xmath203 with @xmath204 .",
    "the term @xmath205 in eq .",
    "( [ balmer_ser ] ) is the generalization of the three - dimensional @xmath206 rule ( with @xmath207 ) to four euclidean dimensions @xcite and describes a generalized o(4 ) _ rotational band _",

    "we conclude that the lower - spin components of the rarita - schwinger fields are forced upon by the properties of the lorentz boost and should not be projected out .",
    "these fields are realized in the spectra of the light - flavor baryons , where the landscape of the excitations is well structured along the rs classification scheme , rather than populated by randomly distributed resonances .",

    "we further showed how presence or absence of the independent cluster excitation sequence @xmath177 , @xmath178 , and @xmath179 , probes the scale of the chiral phase transition for baryons . in this way ,",
    "the `` missing '' state search program through the clas collaboration at jlab @xcite obtains an additional motivation , that is conceptually different from the su(6)@xmath214 o(3)@xmath215 classification scheme .    the dynamical origin for the rs clustering is still lacking a unique explanation and it remains a challenge for future research .",
    "the factorization of isospin from the space - time symmetry in su(2)@xmath212o(1,3)@xmath213 is strongly supported by qcd , where the isodoublet light quarks and the isosinglet heavy - flavor quarks are the established isospin degrees of freedom .",

    "@xcite the bosonic parts of the lorentz clusters , such as @xmath216 from the rs field in eq .",
    "( [ rs_fields ] ) , were considered as independent fundamental bosonic degree of freedom of baryon structure , and the term `` hyperquark '' was coined for them . there , the clustering was modeled after a o(4 ) invariant quark - hyperquark correlation . from a slightly different qcd perspective",
    ", the clusters can also be viewed as string solutions associated with a linear action .",
