    "wind - fed accretion by a compact gravitating object is an important astrophysical phenomenon , which arises in many situations including massive x - ray binaries .",
    "wind accretion has been studied extensively both analytically and numerically .",

    ", they obtained a mass accretion rate of , @xmath0 where the accretion radius , @xmath1 , is given by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 are the density , velocity of the gas at infinity upstream , the gravitational constant and the mass of the object , respectively . in this estimate",
    "the pressure is neglected which means that the mach number of the gas is infinitely large .",
    "bondi & hoyle ( @xcite ) have worked on the model in more detail and bondi ( @xcite ) obtained a formula for the case of spherical accretion .",
    "the latter case means that the mach number at infinity is zero .",
    "he also proposed an interpolation formula for flows with finite mach number .",
    "the numerical computation of axisymmetric wind accretion was first attempted by hunt ( @xcite ) and general agreement between the accretion rates from analytical estimates and his numerical calculations was found .",
    "shima et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and koide et al .",
    "( @xcite ) calculated the same problem using a finer mesh , a modern algorithm and a supercomputer , and found accretion rates about a factor two larger than those obtained by bondi .",
    "if the flow at large distances is not uniform , angular momentum can be transferred to the compact object causing spin up or spin down .",
    "ho et al . ( @xcite ) considered this problem based on non - axisymmetric simulations .",
    "two - dimensional ( planar ) numerical computations of an inhomogeneous flow were carried out and non - steady flip - flop motions were found by several authors ( matsuda et al .",
    "@xcite , taam & fryxell @xcite , fryxell & taam @xcite )    furthermore it was found that non - steady motion occurs even in a homogeneous medium ( matsuda et al .",
    "livio et al . ( @xcite ) suggested a possible cause of the instability .",
    "& anzer ( @xcite ) calculated two  dimensional wind accretion using a smoothed particle method ( sph ) and confirmed the unsteadiness .",
    "benensohn et al .",
    "( @xcite ) calculated uniform wind accretion of an adiabatic gas with polytropic index @xmath7 and got flip - flop nonsteady motions .",
    "three  dimensional simulations of wind accretion were performed and compared with two - dimensional cases by sawada et al .",

    "the three  dimensional calculations performed by ishii et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , ruffert ( @xcite ) and ruffert & arnett ( @xcite ) have sufficient spatial resolution to lead to non - steady oscillatory flows .",
    "generally these oscillations have lower amplitudes than the corresponding two dimensional flows .",
    "since the real size of any astrophysical object is usually many orders of magnitude smaller than the accretion radius , it seems impossible to calculate the flow all the way to the surface .",
    "thus the inner boundary of the computations is much larger than the real object .",
    "this is an artifact of the simulations .",
    "but one finds that most of these calculations show non - steady behaviours of various degrees .",
    "the flows for which @xmath8 is close to units tend to exhibit the largest fluctuations .    in this present investigation",
    "we want to focus on the special case of isothermal flows .",
    "wind accretion with @xmath8 close to unity has been studied by matsuda et al ( @xcite ) , boffin & anzer ( @xcite ) , and ruffert ( 1996 ) .",
    "since these flows were more violent than those of higher @xmath8 they seem of particular interest .",
    "physically they can be thought of as approximations to configuration of low optical depth and efficient radiative losses resulting in a temperature distribution which is almost uniform .    in principle",
    "it would be desirable to include an energy equation which describes all gain and loss mechanisms of the flow .",
    "but this approach would complicate our calculations enormously .",
    "therefore we shall use the approximation of isothermality .",
    "the objective of this study is to calculate the wind accretion flows of an isothermal gas at various mach numbers , @xmath9 , and to study the unsteadiness of the accretion column and the appearance of accretion disks around compact objects using a fine mesh and high resolution scheme .",
    "here we present the results for two dimensional wind accretion of an isothermal gas by a new high resolution numerical scheme with fine numerical meshes .",
    "the governing equations are the hydrodynamic equations of an isothermal gas with gravity .",

    "the mesh size in the radial direction ( @xmath24 ) changes exponentially such as , @xmath25 .",
    "the radius of the absorbing inner boundary ( @xmath26 ) is 0.01 @xmath1 and that of the outer boundary ( @xmath27 ) is 10 @xmath1 .",
    "the standard grid is made of 200 mesh points in the angular direction and 140 mesh points in the radial direction .",
    "for the fine grid , these numbers are 400 and 250 , respectively .",
    "the finest mesh size in the radial direction ( @xmath28 ) is 0.001 @xmath1 in both the standard and the fine grid ( see table [ mesh ] ) .    under astrophysical conditions ,",
    "the inner boundary is usually located at the magnetopause of the compact accreting object .",
    "this radius is in general much smaller than the inner boundary of our computational domain .",
    "but even if the two values are comparable one has to realize that the numerical boundary conditions do not describe the physical situation at the magnetopause which will be much more complex .",

    "our main interest is in the thin accretion column of supersonic flows , thus mach number @xmath9=4 was chosen as the standard case .",
    "the results obtained with the lmc scheme exhibited more mesh dependency than those of the amc scheme , therefore we show mainly the amc results      table [ case ] summarizes how for both the lmc and amc scheme the mass accretion rate , @xmath30 , and the rms value of the angular momentum accretion rate , @xmath31 depend on the details of the models . the mass accretion rate changes from 0.420 to 0.817 when the size of the central hole increases from 0.005 @xmath1 to 0.02 @xmath1 in the lmc calculations ( case lm040_005 , lm040_01 , lm040_02 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass accretion rates for the amc cases are in the range 0.838 to 0.951 .    for the lmc scheme ,",
    "as the central hole becomes smaller , mass and angular momentum accretion also become smaller with the standard grid .",
    "when the central hole is large , a temporary accretion disk is formed and the averaged mass accretion rate is close to the hoyle & lyttleton value .",
    "but for a small central hole an almost permanent accretion disk is formed near the hole which blocks further accretion .",
    "however in the fine grid case this decrease of the mass accretion is not found and the existence of the accretion disk is temporary . on the other hand for the amc scheme ,",
    "accretion disks are always transient and accretion rates are similar .",
    "this fact indicates that the conservation of angular momentum is very important for the accretion problem .",
    "since the results based on the amc scheme have less mesh dependency , they seem to be more reliable .",
    "thus only the results from the amc scheme will be shown in the rest of this section .",
    "+   +     +   +      the accretion column of the supersonic accretion flow is narrow and large oscillations are found . in figure",
    "[ cont222s ] , the typical sequence of the swinging of the accretion column of case am040005 is shown .",
    "the oscillating accretion column swings over 180 degrees .",
    "this oscillation is similar to that shown in the computation of boffin and anzer ( @xcite ) , but there is also an accretion disk in our computation .",
    "the radius of the accretion disk is about 0.1 @xmath1 .",
    "enlarged views are shown in fig .",
    "[ cont221c ] . the formation and destruction of the accretion disk",
    "is clearly seen in these figures .",
    "an anti - clockwise rotating accretion disk is formed at t=22 .",
    "the accreting matter falls from the upper - left direction through the accretion column , thus this matter has anti - clockwise angular momentum and it accelerates the disk .",
    "then the column is pushed backward by accreting matter from upstream .",
    "when the column moves behind the object , the accreting matter has clockwise angular momentum ( t=22.2 ) .",
    "this matter collides with the disk and destroys the disk ( t=22.4 ) .",
    "then a clockwise rotating disk is formed ( t=22.6 and following ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ masbig ] , mass and angular momentum is accreted when the disk collapses",
    ".     +   +    the averaged mass accretion rate of this case is 0.855 , but the instantaneous rate is over 10 times larger than the hoyle & lyttleton estimate .",
    "the averaged momentum accretion is almost zero .",
    "however , a fair amount of instantaneous angular momentum accretion with altering direction is also found .",
    "this can be understood as follows : the symmetric accretion column can not have angular momentum , but the portions of an asymmetric accretion column can have angular momentum .",
    "when the positive angular momentum portion falls downward , a positive accretion disk is formed .",
    "this accretion disk loses its angular momentum and accretes onto the object , when it collides with the following portion which has negative angular momentum .",
    "the histories of mass accretion and angular momentum accretion of representative cases from the amc scheme are shown in fig .",

    "[ lm04001 m ] .",
    "the histories of accretion rates for @xmath9=4.0 from the amc scheme with different @xmath26 and mesh size are shown in figs .",
    "[ am04002 m ] and [ am04002a ] .",
    "as seen in those figures , the fluctuations of the accretion rate become bigger with smaller @xmath26 .",
    "we can see from table 2 and fig .",
    "4 that the mean values of the mass accretion rate are quite similar for different values of @xmath32 , whereas the peak amplitudes of @xmath30 increase with decreasing @xmath32 .",
    "this then implies that the accretion bursts are correspondingly shorter for smaller values of @xmath32 .",
    "although the results for the fine grid ( fig .  [ am04002 m ] & [ am04002a ] ) have fluctuations of higher frequency and are more chaotic , they are generally similar to those for the standard grid .",
    "the similarity is also clearly seen in table [ case ] .",
    "all values except @xmath33 are similar for different @xmath26 .",
    "the sequences of the oscillations are also similar .",
    "the difference in @xmath33 can be explained by the mechanism of the accretion disk destruction .",
    "the orbits of the anti - clockwise rotating accretion disk in fig .",
    "[ cont221c ] are almost circular , but become elliptical when the accreting mater which has clockwise angular momentum interacts with matter of the anti - clockwise rotating disk ( t=22.2 in fig .  [ cont221c ] ) .",
    "the matter is taken away from the computational space when its elliptic orbit touches the central hole .",
    "thus , the bigger central hole absorbs the matter over a longer period than the smaller hole . therefore the fluctuation of mass accretion becomes larger for a smaller hole .    on the other hand ,",
    "the lmc scheme shows a different @xmath26 dependence . for the standard grid ,",
    "the mass accretion rate becomes smaller as @xmath26 decreases , as can be seen from the average values of @xmath30 which are given in table 2 .. because an almost permanent accretion disk is formed it blocks further accretion . but this permanent accretion disk is not found for the fine grid . in this case",
    "the accretion rates show large fluctuations .",
    "the conservation of angular momentum is only achieved to second order accuraey in the lmc scheme .",
    "thus , we believe that the standard grid is not fine enough for the lmc scheme to capture the accretion disk formation .      if the mach number of the uniform flow is 1 , the flow is perfectly steady , but for larger mach number it is always non - steady .",
    "note that the case of @xmath9=1.4 is also non - steady and shows small fluctuations from the beginning .",
    "however , non - steadiness with large amplitudes occurs only after 40 time units .",
    "the mach number dependence of the averaged mass accretion rate , the fluctuation of the mass accretion rate and the fluctuation of the angular momentum accretion rate are summarized in fig .",
    "these are the results from the amc scheme with the standard grid .    as shown in fig",
    ".  [ rate ] the amplitude of the oscillations is largest when the mach number is 2 , and the fluctuations become smaller as the mach number becomes greater than 4 .",
    "this is also shown in the history of the mass and angular momentum accretion of the mach 8 case ( case am080_01 ) in fig .",
    "[ am08001 m ] .    as the mach number increases ,",
    "the amplitudes of the accretion column oscillation become smaller .",
    "this behavior is clearly shown in the time averaged density contours of fig .",
    "[ am02001av ] . in the time",
    "averaged solution , the wiggles of the accretion column are smeared out and the high density regions around the accreting object are seen .",
    "the high density regions are concentrated in a narrow cone in the high mach number cases ( see the @xmath34=8 case in fig .",
    "[ am02001av ] ) .",
    "it is interesting that the transient accretion disks are also seen as high density regions in the averaged solutions and that averaged accretion columns look like bow shocks .",
    "two dimensional planar wind accretion flows of a supersonic isothermal gas were analyzed numerically .",
    "the computational efficiency was improved as compared to earlier calculations by using an accurate local time stepping and a new type of upwind scheme .",
    "comparing our new results with earlier calculations one realises that 2d flows with @xmath8 close to unity have so far not been studied very systematically .",
    "matsuda et al . ( 1992 ) presented one case with @xmath35 and one with @xmath36 .",
    "their resolution near the central object was much coarser than our resolution .",
    "they had also obtained flip - flop configurations , but the instability took much longer to develop .",
    "their amplitudes were smaller and the widths of the accretion columns considerably larger .",
    "boffin and anzer ( 1994 ) also calculated one model with @xmath37 which has a narrow oscillating accretion column , but again a low amplitude .",
    "3d flows with @xmath38 have been systematically studied by ruffert ( 1996 ) . in",
    "these flows the accretion regions are always much wider and do not show the systematic oscillations of entire accretion region , although the accretion itself is non - steady . there differences between 3d and 2d flows are quite general and independent of the value of @xmath8 .",
    "we also have developed a numerical scheme which exactly conserves angular momentum ( amc scheme ) and compared its performance to the earlier linear momentum conserving ( lmc ) scheme .",
    "we found that the results obtained with our lmc scheme depend very strongly on the resolution of the grid used , whereas the amc scheme gives almost no difference for the two types of resolution considered here .",
    "therefore we feel that the amc calculations are much more reliable and all the results presented in the previous section are based on this scheme .",
    "the fact that our amc and lmc results differ by large amounts suggests to us that many of the earlier calculations which basically conserve linear momentum should be taken with caution",
    ". this will be particularly important for the temporal behavior of the accretion of angular momentum @xmath39 ( t ) .",
    "our calculations of supersonic flows show that in all cases the accretion of both mass and angular momentum is very erratic .",
    "it occurs in very short intervals and at extremely high rates .",
    "this behavior can be explained by the formation of keplerian disks near the inner boundary .",
    "if the specific angular momentum of the infalling material is larger than that of the kepler orbit at the innermost radius then this material can not accrete .",
    "if such high angular momentum material is flowing in long enough , a disk will form which blocks further accretion very efficiently .",
    "material with very low angular momentum or with opposite rotation falling in during a subsequent phase interacts with the disk and can destroy it .",
    "this will lead to a burst of the accreted mass and angular momentum .",
    "after such a burst the process can be repeated and a new disk will form .",
    "our calculations indicate that reversals of the disk rotation are quite common .    for the modeling of x - ray binaries fed by wind accretion the fluctuations of @xmath39 are of major importance .",
    "they can be brought into relation with the observed spin - up and spin - down of these x - ray pulsars ; see anzer & brner ( @xcite ) . in their investigation they showed that the random fluctuations calculated by ruffert ( @xcite ) for 3d models were by a factor @xmath40 too low in order to explain the pulse period variations observed in the source vela x-1 . however our new calculations give variations of @xmath39 which are substantially larger than those found by ruffert .",
    "we have obtained typical values of rms @xmath41 of the order of 0.2 in our dimensionless units ( see table [ case ] ) .",
    "this result can also be formulated as : @xmath42 since @xmath30 is typically of the order unity . on the other hand ruffert ( @xcite )",
    "gives rms(j)=0.01@xmath43 for @xmath44 and rms(j ) = 0.03@xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "taking into account that rms(@xmath47)=rms ( @xmath48j ) and @xmath48 @xmath49 we have rms ( @xmath39 ) = ( 0.01 - 0.03)@xmath45 . therefore our values for the fluctuations area factor 3 to 10 larger than those of ruffert s 3d calculations .",
    "therefore on the basis of our calculations one might conclude that the observed period fluctuations could in principle , be caused by random fluctuations of @xmath39 .",
    "but the amplitudes are only marginally large enough and any slight reduction of the efficency would rule out this interpretation .",
    "there is in particular the aspect that our calculations are two  dimensional whereas the real flows are three  dimensional and the difference in amplitudes between 2d and 3d flows could be sufficiently large to make the described interpretation invalid . to really answer",
    "this question requires full 3d computations , taking angular momentum conservation into account .",
