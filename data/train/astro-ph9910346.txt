    "an interest in galaxy interactions at high redshift can be motivated from several directions .",
    "it has been shown that many of the observed properties of galaxies at @xmath04 ( e.g. , their number density , luminosity function , colours , sizes , velocity dispersions , etc . )",
    "are well - reproduced by a model in which these galaxies are predominantly starbursts triggered by galaxy interactions ( somerville , primack , & faber 1999 ; spf ) .",
    "in addition , the collision rate of dark matter halos in high - resolution cosmological n - body simulations shows a marked increase at earlier epochs , and the clustering properties of these colliding halos at @xmath1 are similar to those of the observed lyman - break galaxies ( kolatt et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "previous numerical investigations of starbursts in interacting galaxies ( e.g. mihos & hernquist 1994a ; 1996 ) have assumed initial properties typical of local galaxies .",
    "many of these properties ( e.g. , gas content , surface density , disk - to - halo ratio ) may be quite different at high redshift . using the same code as mihos & hernquist",
    ", we are carrying out an ongoing program of simulations to more fully explore the parameter space with an emphasis on high - redshift galaxies .",
    "a more complete version of these preliminary results will be presented in rosenfeld et al .",
    "( in prep . ) .",
    "we use the treesph code , including star formation using a schmidt law ( @xmath2 ) as described in mihos & hernquist ( 1994b ) .",
    "we set the proportionality constant in this equation by requiring the isolated galaxies to lie on the relation given by kennicutt ( 1998 ) .",
    "masses and mass ratios of typical colliding dark matter halos at @xmath3 were determined using the simulations discussed in kolatt et al .",
    "for all calculations requiring the assumption of a cosmology , we assume the same cosmological model as those simulations , namely @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 km / s / mpc . the mass and exponential scale radius of the stars and gas in the galactic disk inhabiting a halo of a given mass at the desired redshift are estimated using the semi - analytic models of spf , and are consistent with known properties of lyman - break galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "the disks are assumed to be stable before the start of the interaction .",
    "the results presented here are for an interaction between equal mass , bulgeless galaxies , with halo mass @xmath7 , stellar mass @xmath8 , stellar scale radius 1.7 kpc , gas fraction @xmath9 and gas scale radius 3.4 kpc .",
    "all other properties ( relative inclination , orbit , etc . ) , are the same as the fiducial case of mihos & hernquist ( 1996 ; mh96 ) .",
    "the star formation rate over the course of the interaction is shown in figure 1 ( left panel ) .",
    "the behaviour is qualitatively similar to the results of mh96 .",
    "we convolve this star formation history with stellar population models ( gissel98 , bruzual & charlot in prep . ) to obtain the apparent magnitude of the galaxy at @xmath1 ( figure 1 , right panel ) .",
    "we have used the solar metallicity models with a salpeter imf .",
    "we show the magnitudes in the wf / pc f606w ( @xmath10 ) and nicmos f160w ( @xmath11 ) filters ( ab system ) , which probe the rest - frame @xmath12 and @xmath13 part of the spectrum at @xmath3 .",
    "the top set of curves in the right panel neglects dust extinction ; the bottom set shows the result of including a correction of a factor of @xmath14 at 1500  , as suggested by recent observational estimates of typical extinction corrections in bright lbgs ( meurer et al . 1999 ; steidel et al .",
    "1999 ) , and assuming a calzetti attenuation curve ( calzetti et al .",
    "1996 ) . with this level of dust extinction",
    ", the bursting galaxy would be visible at present spectroscopic limits for about 200 myr , whereas in the absence of the burst the galaxy would have been well below the detection limit .",
    "note that in the absence of dust reddening , the @xmath15 color of the galaxy during the burst is quite blue ( -0.5  0 ) , but after the dust correction , typical values ( 0.5 to 1.0 ) are reasonably consistent with observations .",
    "figure 2 shows how the interacting galaxy would appear if observed at @xmath1 by hst ( in the absence of noise or sky background ) at various times during the merger . left",
    "panels show the wf / pc @xmath10 filter with a pixel size of 0.04 arcsec ; the right panels show the nicmos @xmath11 filter with 0.08 arcsec pixels . from top to bottom , the galaxies are shown at the beginning of the simulation , during the first interaction of the galaxies , after the galaxies have separated again , and finally after the final merger .",
    "these images can be matched up with the star formation and total magnitude curves shown in figure  1 by multiplying the simulation time units shown on the figure by a factor of 8.3 to convert to myr .",
    "if in fact the observed galaxy population becomes increasingly dominated by merging starburst systems at higher redshifts , one would expect to observe larger fractions of galaxies with disturbed morphologies and significant substructure .",
    "we plan to use synthesized images such as figure  2 to develop statistics to quantify these effects , and eventually to test whether the morphological properties of observed high - redshift galaxies are consistent with the collisional starburst scenario .",
