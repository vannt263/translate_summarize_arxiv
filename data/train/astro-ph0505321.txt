    "one of the most useful near - infrared spectral regions for spectropolarimetric investigations of solar and stellar magnetic fields is that located around 10830  , which contains both the photospheric line of at 10827   and the chromospheric lines that result from the 10830 multiplet ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "of particular interest is the fact that the ` blue ' and ` red ' components of this multiplet are sensitive to both the hanle and zeeman effects , which offers a suitable diagnostic window for investigating magnetic fields in a variety of solar plasma structures , such as prominences ( @xcite @xcite ) , emerging flux regions ( @xcite @xcite ) and solar chromospheric spicules ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the 10830    multiplet originates between a lower term ( @xmath3 ) and an upper term ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "therefore , it comprises three spectral lines ( see , e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) : a ` blue ' component at 10829.09    with @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( hereafter transition  1 , or tr1 for abbreviation ) , and two ` red ' components at 10830.25    with @xmath7 ( hereafter , tr2 ) and at 10830.34    with @xmath8 ( hereafter , tr3 ) which appear blended at solar atmospheric temperatures .    in a previous paper ( @xcite @xcite , hereafter paper - i )",
    ", we demonstrated that the determination of the magnetic field vector via the analysis of the observed polarization in the 10830   multiplet must be carried out considering the wavelength positions and the strengths of the zeeman components in the incomplete paschen - back effect regime .",
    "the theory of the paschen - back effect in this regime is detailed in section 3.4 of the book by @xcite ( @xcite ) .",
    "the problem of finding the strengths and the splittings of the various magnetic components , arising in the transition from a lower and an upper term , both described in the l - s coupling scheme ( @xmath9s and @xmath9p , respectively , in the case of the @xmath1010830 line ) , is reduced to the numerical diagonalization of a number of matrices .",
    "the expressions of the matrix elements are given , in terms of wigner - symbols , in eq .",
    "( 3.57 ) of that book , or , in analytical form , in eqs .",
    "( 3.61a , b ) .",
    "as pointed out in paper - i , our results have been obtained through the adaptation to the fine - structure case of a computer program previously developed to handle the similar problem for hyperfine - structured multiplets ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "fig  [ fig : corrected ] shows the transition components with the linear zeeman splitting ( lzs ) approximation and the rigorous calculation considering the incomplete paschen - back splitting effects ( ipbs ) .",
    "the figure has been reproduced from paper - i , but corrects a plotting error in one of the tr3 @xmath11-components .",
    "significant differences between lzs and ipbs are to be expected for typical magnetic strengths in sunspots , simply because for fields stronger than about 400 gauss the zeeman splittings of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 levels of the upper term become comparable to their energy separation and the perturbation theory of the familiar zeeman effect is no longer valid . however , the discrepancies between the emergent stokes profiles calculated assuming lzs or ipbs turn out to be significant even for field strengths substantially weaker than the level - crossing field of @xmath0400  g ( see paper - i ) .    in this paper",
    "we provide polynomial approximants that allow researchers to calculate zeeman components and strengths of this interesting multiplet in the ipbs regime .",
    "this will facilitate the generalization of numerical codes developed with the lzs approximation , such as the milne - eddington code of @xcite @xcite , and to improve the efficiency of the ipbs code of socas - navarro et al ( 2004 ) .",
    "moreover , it may also be useful for solving the full non - lte polarization transfer problem in the 10830 multiplet within the framework of the incomplete paschen - back effect theory .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] demonstrates that our polynomial approach to the ipbs regime in the 10830   multiplet is sufficiently accurate for the calculation of the emergent stokes profiles from a magnetized stellar atmosphere .",
    "let us characterize the deviation of the zeeman pattern from the lzs as polynomials . for each zeeman component",
    ", we have : @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the relative position of a given component ( in m ) , @xmath16 represents the relative strengths which are dimensionless quantities ( see , e.g. , eq  [ 3.64 ] in @xcite @xcite ) , @xmath17 is the magnetic field intensity expressed in kg , and @xmath18 are the approximant polynomials . since the expressions for the splittings and the strengths in the ipbs regime have to converge to those of the lzs effect under the limit of weak fields , and since , under the same limit , the splittings are linear in the magnetic field and the strengths tend to a constant , it has to be expected that the differences @xmath19 and @xmath20 are of the form : @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "the following tables list the coefficients for the corrections @xmath23 and @xmath24 that need to be applied to the lzs approximation to account for ipb effects .",
    "the last column of each table lists the maximum fitting error in the range considered ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the components are sorted in the order of increasing wavelengths in the lzs regime .",
