    "preparation of atomic states containing exactly a fixed number @xmath0 of atoms ( fock states ) is of importance for a wide range of applications , from studying ultracold chemistry and few - body physics to precision measurements and quantum information processing .",
    "the aim of such a preparation is to create a quantum state with the mean number of atoms @xmath1 equal to the chosen @xmath0 and its mean variance as small as possible .",
    "different proposal based on a time - dependent modulation of the confining potential have been put forward both for optical traps @xcite and optical lattices @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have shown the possibility of achieving atom - number sub - poissonian statistics in a quantum degenerate gas with repulsive interactions @xcite .",
    "the key idea is that the mean number of trapped atoms can be controlled by adiabatically reducing the depth of the trap while expelling the excess of atoms .",
    "the precision of the control improves by maximising the energy splitting between states with different number of particles which ultimately allows one to discriminate such states by modulating the depth of the trapping potential .",
    "this technique is referred as to atom culling @xcite . for ultracold gases confined in tight - waveguides ,",
    "it works optimally in the strongly interacting regime for bosonic samples @xcite , i. e. , in the tonks - girardeau gas , where the repulsive interactions lead to an effective pauli exclusion principle @xcite .",
    "alternatively , fock state preparation is optimized as well with a spin - polarized non - interacting fermi gas @xcite .",
    "bearing in mind that both systems ( which are dual under bose - fermi mapping @xcite ) share all local correlation functions , and in particular the atom - number distribution @xcite , we shall address the polarized fermions for brevity in the following .",
    "nonetheless , all results in this paper apply to both systems .",
    "non - interacting spinless fermions when placed in a trap occupy the lowest one - particle levels in the ground state . changing the shape of the potential trap aims to expel redundant atoms into continuum levels leaving the bound states of the final trap filled to its maximum capacity , @xmath2 .",
    "this condition together with the pauli exclusion principle ensures high fidelity of the preparation : since no more than @xmath0 atoms can be distributed over @xmath0 levels of the final well , the variance @xmath3 must vanish , and precisely @xmath0 atoms will be found in each individual case .",
    "a slow change of the trapping potential would guarantee , by virtue of the adiabatic theorem , full occupation of the states in the final well .",
    "the adiabaticity may , however , require times large compared to the time scales typically involved in ultracold atom experiments and one might wish for a faster way to achieve full final occupation .",
    "one of the counter intuitive results obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite is that an infinitely fast `` sudden '' change provides an alternative to the adiabatic route which can lead to the preparation of ideal fock states , when making the well shallower ( weakening of the trap ) is accompanied by also making it narrower ( squeezing ) .",
    "further , at zero temperature , the best results are obtained @xcite in case the projector on the subspace of all filled initial states @xmath4 contains the projector @xmath5 on the subspace spanned by all bound states of the final well ( @xmath6 ) , i.e. , when on that subspace @xmath4 can be approximated by unity .",
    "in addition , non - zero temperature effects can be overcome by starting with a larger initial sample @xcite .",
    "however , the sudden limit may not be accessible in a given experimental set up , and the main purpose of the present paper is to explore the behaviour of the trapped atoms when a change of the potential is neither sudden , nor adiabatically slow .",
    "in particular , we will show that the efficiency of the fock state preparation exhibits a non - monotonic behaviour as a function of the duration of the quench of the trapping potential .",
    "we will also address other questions such as the dependence of final occupation on the depths of the initial and the final wells , and the escape time required for the expelled atoms to leave the well region .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we will study the dependence of the final occupation on the time in which the trapping potential changes its shape . in sect .",
    "iii we briefly discuss the behaviour of the variance when the final well is filled close to its maximal capacity . in sections",
    "iv we review two different mechanisms responsible for the formation of nearly ideal fock states in the adiabatic and sudden limits . in sections",
    "v we discuss the escape of expelled particles from the final well region , and section vi contains our conclusions .",
    "consider a number of non - interacting spinless fermions ( fermionised bosons ) initially trapped in a one - dimesional rectangular square well of depth @xmath7 and width @xmath8 . the potential @xmath9 undergoes , over a time @xmath10 , a transformation such that its final shape is also a rectangular well , but with new depth and width , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "although other types of evolution are possible , we will consider linear change of both the depth and width of the trap , @xmath13 where the ramping time @xmath10 determines whether evolution of the potential is rapid or slow .",
    "our aim is to control the mean number @xmath14 of the fermions trapped in the final trap , while minimizing the variance @xmath15 for the case of zero temperature .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , non - zero temperature effects turn out to be non - critical and can be conveniently overcome by starting with a larger initial sample as described in @xcite .",
    "we will further assume that the initial and final traps support @xmath16 and @xmath17 bound states , respectively , and that there are @xmath18 fermions occupying the first @xmath19 levels of the initial well .",
    "a well known technique @xcite allows to express @xmath14 and @xmath20 for a system of non - interacting fermions in terms of the solutions of the corresponding one - particle schrdinger equation .",
    "let us denote by @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) the states of the initial ( final ) trap .",

    "as expected , the final occupation increases and the fidelity improves as one approaches the adiabatic limit , where the variance of the resulting state vanishes .",
    "this result ( a consequence of the adiabatic theorem ) does not depend on whether weakening , squeezing or a combination of both techniques is applied .",
    "it is worth noting that , to our knowledge , the question of exactly how slowly the potential must evolve to ensure adiabaticity in the case the @xmath0-th level in the final well lies close to the edge of continuum remains open and requires further investigation .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the applicability of the adiabatic method may be limited by a finite lifetime of the trapped condensate .    in the _ sudden limit _ where the shape of the well changes",
    "almost instantaneously we have @xmath70 @xmath71 and @xmath72 , i. e. @xmath73 .",
    "let us recall that if @xmath59 , i.e , the final well would contain a fock state with precisely @xmath0 fermions .",
    "remarkably , the use of either either weakening and squeezing in the sudden limit lead to quasi - fock states of limited fidelity @xcite , while the combination of both techniques can lead to ideal fock states @xcite .",
    "generally , sudden quenches of the trap might lead to undesirable excitations of the transverse modes breakdown the effective one - dimensional character of the system .",
    "we have seen that both adiabatic and sudden changes of the trapping potential can in principle lead to the preparation of ideal fock states , but as idealized limits might be of limited relevance to experimental implementation of atom culling techniques .    motivated by this observation we next look at the mean particle number and variance of a state resulting from a combined process of squeezing and weakening of the trap in finite time , see fig . [ fig2 ] . here , @xmath69 stays close to the maximum capacity of the well for all ramping times , but exhibits a dip at @xmath74 .",

    "let us start by introducing the deficiency operator @xmath81    inserting ( [ 7 ] ) into ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) yields @xmath82 and @xmath83 from eqs .",

    "note also that in the case of almost full final occupation , knowing @xmath69 and @xmath20 allows one to reconstruct the full counting statistics .",

    ", initial one - particle levels are gradually pushed into the continuum , and most of the atoms have time to leave @xmath104 while the potential shape is still changing .",
    "once the change has stopped one still has to wait approximately @xmath30 for the contribution from the @xmath116-th state to clear the area . although comparable in magnitude , the wait is somewhat longer than that in the nearly sudden limit , mostly because the expelled atoms receive more energy and move faster if the change of the potential shape is sudden .",

    "in summary , we have investigated formation of atomic fock states by gradually changing the trapping potential and expelling the excess of atoms out of the trap . for the case in which either the depth ( weakening ) or the width ( squeezing ) of the potential trap are reduced",
    ", an increase of the ramping time leads to an improvement in the fidelity of the procedure until the adiabatic limit is reached .",
    "this monotonic behaviour in a relevant variable is generic in phenomena with sudden to adiabatic crossovers .",
    "for example , in a landau - zener transition in which the crossing time is gradually increased , the final state goes from one level to the other depending on that time and the corresponding degree of adiabaticity of the passage .",
    "however , in our case , a combination of both procedures ( squeezing and weakening ) , which produces high fidelity fock states in the sudden limit , remains superior to either of both operations for all ramping times .",
    "this opens a new route for feasible atomic fock state creation by trap reduction , approximating the sudden limit in the laboratory .",
    "the behaviour along the crossover is non monotonic and for finite quenching times one observes a decrease in the mean number of trapped atoms which is accompanied by a corresponding increase in its variance .",
