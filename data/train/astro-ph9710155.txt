    "the s stars are late - type giants whose spectra resemble those of m giants , with the addition of distinctive molecular bands of zro ( merrill 1922 ) .",
    "the presence of zro bands is often considered as a direct consequence of molecular equilibrium in the special circumstances where the atmospheric c / o ratio is within 10% of unity ( e.g. scalo & ross 1976 ) .",
    "however , piccirillo ( 1980 ) has shown that the above statement is only valid for stars with @xmath13  k. at higher temperatures , an enhanced zr abundance , rather than a c / o ratio close to unity , is the dominant factor in the development of strong zro bands .",
    "detailed abundance analyses ( smith & lambert 1990 ) have shown that the envelopes of s stars are enriched in heavy elements like zr , and so bear the signature of the s - process of nucleosynthesis ( kppeler et al . 1989 ) .",
    "although larger than in m giants , the c / o ratio of s stars is not necessarily close to unity ( smith & lambert 1990 ) , except in the so - called sc stars ( dominy et al .",
    "1986 ) .",
    "when s stars were still believed to be objects with c / o close to unity , they were naturally considered as transition objects between m giants ( c / o @xmath14 ) and carbon stars ( c / o @xmath15 ) on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) ( iben & renzini 1983 ) .",
    "support to this scenario is provided by observations of s stars on the upper agb of globular clusters in the magellanic clouds ( bessell et al .",
    "1983 ; lloyd evans 1983 , 1984 , 1985 ) . in this evolutionary phase ,",
    "low- and intermediate - mass stars are characterized by a double ( h , he ) burning - shell structure which is thermally unstable . the thermal instabilities ( ` thermal pulses ' ) developing in the he - burning shell are the site of a rich nucleosynthesis ( frost & lattanzio 1995 ) , probably including the s - process , although its detailed mode of operation remains poorly understood ( e.g. sackmann & boothroyd 1991 ; herwig et al .",
    "1997 ) . in the receding phase of the thermal instability ,",
    "the convective outer envelope may plunge ( ` third dredge - up ' ) into the intershell zone containing the he - burning ashes , and bring fresh carbon and s - process elements to the surface .",
    "however , several observations have challenged this traditional m  s  c evolution sequence .",
    "the first set of observations relates to tc , an element with no stable isotopes , discovered in the spectra of some s stars by merrill ( 1952 ) .",
    "if the s - process indeed occurred during recent thermal pulses in s stars , tc should be observed at the surface along with the other s - process elements ( mathews et al .",
    "little et al . ( 1987 ) found however that only long - period mira or semiregular s stars ( i.e. , intrinsically bright s stars ) exhibit tc lines .",
    "second , the broad range of iras colors exhibited by s stars ( e.g. , jorissen et al . 1993 ) is difficult to reconcile with the idea that they represent a brief transition phase as the star evolves from an oxygen - rich m giant with c / o @xmath14 into a c star with c / o @xmath15 .",
    "m and c stars occupy well - defined regions in the iras color - color diagram , and it is not clear how s stars fit into the ( much debated ) evolutionary sequence joining m stars to c stars in that diagram ( willems & de jong 1986 , 1988 ; chan & kwok 1988 ; zuckerman & maddalena 1989 ; de jong 1989 ) .",
    "these problems received a new impetus with the discovery that the barium stars , a family of peculiar red giant ( prg ) stars of spectral type g and k , are all members of binary systems ( mcclure et al .",
    "1980 ; mcclure 1983 ) .",
    "iben & renzini ( 1983 ) were the first to propose that tc - poor s stars could perhaps be the cooler analogs of the barium stars .",
    "long - term radial - velocity monitorings confirmed this suggestion , and it is now clear that tc - poor s stars are binary stars ( smith & lambert 1988 ; brown et al . 1990 ; jorissen & mayor 1992 ; jorissen et al .",
    "1993 ; johnson et al .",
    "1993 ) with orbital elements identical to those of barium stars ( jorissen et al .",
    "tc - poor s stars are now referred to as ` extrinsic s stars ' , because , like barium stars , they owe their chemical peculiarities to mass transfer across the binary system . on the contrary ,",
    "tc - rich , ` intrinsic s stars ' are genuine thermally - pulsing ( tp ) stars on the tp - agb .",
    "since the c / o ratio of extrinsic s stars depends on the details of the mass accretion process , it is not necessarily close to unity , but as discussed above , neither abundance analyses nor predictions of molecular chemical equilibrium really require c / o to be close to unity in s stars .    in paper i ( jorissen et al .",
    "1993 ; see also groenewegen 1993 ) , it was shown that the correlation tc - poor / binary found for s stars could be extended to their iras colors , since another distinctive property of binary , tc - poor s stars is the absence of ir excesses .",
    "their iras colors simply reflect the photospheric colors , contrary to tc - rich s stars which usually exhibit ir excesses .",
    "these ir excesses are caused by circumstellar dust , and are indicative of substantial mass loss , thus suggesting that tc - rich s stars are more massive and/or more evolved than tc - poor s stars .",
    "the possibility offered by the circumstellar properties of s stars to probe their evolutionary status has been used in several recent studies ( jura 1988 ; chen & kwok 1993 ; bieging & latter 1994 ; sahai & liechti 1995 ) .",
    "however , these studies still rely on hypotheses not fully consistent with the dichotomy recently found among s stars , as discussed above , and their conclusions may therefore be somewhat biased .",
    "for example , it makes no sense to test the agb evolutionary sequence m  s ",
    "c using a sample of s stars not properly cleaned from its extrinsic content . in addition , models inferring the chemical nature ( carbonaceous or silicate ) of the dust grains from models assuming that c / o is close to unity in the photosphere do not sample the whole parameter space occupied by these stars . a similarly incorrect corollary consists of concluding that dust production , and thus mass loss , is not very efficient in s stars because dust - seed molecules no longer form in the absence of any free c or o atoms , since these are all tied up in co when c / o @xmath16 .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to rediscuss the circumstellar properties of s stars and to put these properties in perspective with our current understanding of the evolutionary status of s stars , in particular the intrinsic / extrinsic dichotomy .",
    "an extensive data set probing the circumstellar environment of s stars ( iras colors , maser emission , co rotational lines ) has therefore been collected and critically evaluated .",
    "this data set combines new material with existing results collected from the literature .",
    "the iras colors of s stars provide a first way to probe their circumstellar environment , and more specifically , to evaluate the amount and nature of the dust surrounding these objects . a re - evaluation of the flux densities listed in the iras _ point source catalogue _ ( iras science team 1988 ; psc ) was necessary to circumvent the problems of interpretation related to the intrinsic ir variability of these sources and to their possible contamination by galactic cirrus emission .",
    "these effects are not always properly handled in the psc .",
    "this re - evaluation was performed by co - adding the raw scans ( sect .",
    "the clean flux densities were then used to define five regions in the @xmath17 , [ 25]-[60])$ ] color - color diagram ( sect .",
    "2.3 ) which contain stars of similar extrinsic or intrinsic nature and of similar zro / tio , c / o and ir spectral indices .",
    "several s stars with shells resolved at 60 ( and sometimes 100 )  @xmath3 m have been found by comparing the source profile with the iras point source response function ( sect .",
    "2.4 ) . resolved shells at 60  @xmath3 m appear to be correlated with large 60  @xmath3 m excesses , suggesting that these shells have detached from their parent star .",
    "a simple model of the dust shell has been used to predict its ir colors and to infer the chemical nature of the dust grains ( sect .",
    "4 ) , using constraints provided by the detection or non - detection of maser emission ( sect .  3 ) .",
    "finally , mass loss rates have been derived in an homogeneous way ( sect .",
    "5.3 ) from the intensities of the co millimeter - wave lines , derived from new observations with the caltech submillimeter observatory ( sect .  5.1 ) or collected from the literature ( sect .",
    "the mass loss rates , wind expansion velocities , ir colors and extrinsic / intrinsic nature are then discussed together in sect .",
    "the sample of s stars considered in this paper was selected from the list of chen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , which provides associations between iras sources from the psc and s stars from the _ general catalogue of galactic s stars _",
    "( gcgss , stephenson 1984 ) and from an additional later list ( stephenson 1990 ) . among these , only stars having flux densities of good quality ( i.e. with a quality flag of 3 in the psc ) in the 12 , 25 and 60  @xmath3 m  bands have been retained .",
    "several stars that have probably been misclassified as s stars were removed from the final sample .",
    "for example , stars from the original westerlund & olander ( 1978 ) sample were later recognized by lloyd evans & catchpole ( 1989 ) as actually being heavily - reddened m giants or supergiants .",
    "a few other cases of m giants or supergiants misclassified as s stars were identified by keenan & mcneil ( 1989 ; hr 3296 = gcgss 500 ) and winfrey et al .",
    "( 1994 ; gcgss 1314 and star 41 in stephenson 1990 ) . a detailed heavy - element abundance analysis ( lambert et al .",
    "1995 ) has shown that the stars de  leo ( hr  4088 ) and hr  7442 , although often considered as s stars , have normal abundances . according to meadows et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , gcgss 886 ( iras 15194 - 5115 ) is now classified as a carbon star and thus has not been retained in the final sample of s stars .",
    "our final sample may still be somewhat contaminated by m supergiants misclassified as s stars and by a few carbon stars .",
    "the star t cet for example was classified as m5 - 6se in the original paper by keenan ( 1954 ) defining the s class , but it was reclassified as m5/m6ib / ii in the michigan spectral survey ( houk & cowley 1975 ) . since at the low plate dispersions used in classification work , these two types of spectra look similar ( e.g. lloyd evans & catchpole 1989 ) , t cet has been kept in our final list until higher resolution spectra resolve these conflicting classifications .",
    "the same holds true for tv dra and op her ( see table  2 of gcgss ) .",
    "note , however , that sc stars like rz peg , fu mon and gp ori are retained in the sample , since they may provide important clues to the evolutionary status of s stars as a whole . similarly interesting are the two cs stars tt cen and bh cru that are known to exhibit zro bands at some times and c@xmath18 bands at others ( stephenson 1973 ; lloyd evans 1985 ) .",
    "the final sample consists of 124 s stars having flux densities at 12 , 25 and 60  @xmath3 m  flagged as being of good quality in the psc .",
    "these stars are listed in table 1 .",
    "however , psc flux densities suffer from several shortcomings that make them inadequate for the present study .",
    "first , the 60  @xmath3 m  flux density may in some cases be seriously contaminated by galactic cirrus emission , as shown by ivezi@xmath19 & elitzur ( 1995 ) .",
    "second , the psc flux densities are not appropriate in the case of slightly extended or variable sources , as several s stars appear to be . moreover , hysteresis of the detectors hampers the search for extended sources and should be properly identified .",
    "finally , the detectors may saturate on very bright sources , those with flux densities in excess of 1000 jy ( like @xmath20  cyg , see appendix a ) .    in order to correctly handle these effects ,",
    "the raw iras data for all s stars in our sample were reprocessed through the addscan procedure provided by the _ infrared processing and analysis center _ ( ipac ) .",
    "this procedure has been used to co - add all scans passing within 17 of the target position . before being co - added , the raw data are first interpolated using cubic splines and resampled at 10 data points per arcminute in all bands .",
    "a baseline is then defined for each individual scan by fitting a parabola to the data in a window extending from @xmath21 to @xmath22 from the target ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the 12 , 25 , 60 and 100  @xmath3 m bands , respectively ) .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "residual @xmath25 of the data around the baseline fit is an indication of the background noise in a given scan @xmath26 ( note that possible nearby sources with a peak flux density exceeding @xmath27 are automatically removed and do not enter the final residual calculation ) .",
    "the different scans are then co - added with weighting factors equal to @xmath28",
    ". the noise @xmath29 in the co - added scan , computed in a similar way as for the individual scans , is smaller than that in any individual scan , and the reduction may be substantial when scans with very different orientations , sampling different regions of the sky around the target , are available , since structure in the galactic cirrus emission contributes to the noise .",
    "finally , a point - source template with adjustable width is fitted to the co - added scan in the target window @xmath30 .",
    "three different estimates of the flux densities in each band are then computed : the peak flux density @xmath31 , the template flux density @xmath32 and the ` zero - crossing ' flux density @xmath33 .",
    "the template flux density @xmath32 is derived from the template fit to the data , and generally agrees with @xmath31 , unless the source is extended or hysteresis effects are important . for extended sources ,",
    "the ` zero - crossing ' flux density @xmath33 must be preferred .",

    "[ sect : extended ] , a criterion based on the comparison of @xmath33 and @xmath31 has been designed to identify sources with possibly resolved shells . if that criterion is met , the @xmath33 flux density ( identified by a ` + ' in table  [ tab : iras ] ) has been adopted instead of @xmath32 . in the case of bright sources , detector hysteresis results in a trail extending along the scan direction , thus disturbing the template fit . in that case , @xmath31 has been adopted .",
    "the template fit to sources embedded in strong galactic cirrus emission generally resulted in an abnormally narrow profile , because the adopted baseline is then too high with respect to the base of the source signal .",

    "e is actually not very different from that in paper i ( matching uppercase with lowercase letters , and with region d splitting into d and e ) , but it is clearly superior since several stars that appeared exceptional in paper  i fit well into the present classification .",

    "first , very bright ( @xmath46 jy ) sources may have a characteristic six - pointed star shape due to reflection from the telescope secondary mirror struts .",
    "since approximately 5% of the peak flux density may be contained in the star pattern , @xmath33/@xmath31  values of the order of 1.05 may be of instrumental origin ( levine et al .",
    "bright sources are also affected by hysteresis in the detector which causes a trail in the signal along the scan direction in the outgoing part of the scan .",
    "this trail is easily recognized on individual scans as it causes an asymmetry in the template fit .",
    "however , if the co - added scan results from individual scans made in opposite directions , as is often the case , trails will be present in both directions and will mimick an extended plateau at the base of the profile . for bright sources ( @xmath47 jy ) , this effect may thus also cause spurious excesses of the order of a few percent .",
    "finally , for fainter sources , an inhomogeneous background may also cause spurious detections . in this case , a way to estimate the significance of the excess @xmath44 is to compare it with the inverse signal - to - noise ratio @xmath48/@xmath31 , which is nothing more than the relative flux density excess expected from the background noise .",

    "column 1 gives the julian date of the observations computed from the ` satellite operation plan ' number attached to each scan and from the mission chronology provided by the _",
    "explanatory supplement_. column 2 lists the phase .",
    "next are the flux density , the offset between the scan center and the stellar position , and the detector number for the 12  @xmath3 m data .",
    "the final columns contain the 25  @xmath3 m and 60  @xmath3 m flux densities and the @xmath40 - [ 25]$ ] and @xmath5 - [ 60]$ ] colors calculated from combinations of the observed flux densities .",
    "the colors calculated from the flux densities derived from individual scans locate @xmath20 cyg in region b of the color - color diagram .",
    "table a1 shows that there are occasionally large discrepancies between the flux densities measured by different detectors at the same time ; see , for example , the 12  @xmath3 m flux densities observed at jd2445466.1 .",
    "the low flux density is probably due to the large offset between the stellar and detector center positions ; such discrepant observations are usually filtered out in the iras data processing .",
    "real variability is also apparent .",
    "the data were obtained at two epochs , near maximum and minimum phase , and the flux densities at all four wavelengths are systematically higher for the first set of observations than the second . the mean flux densities for these two epochs are listed in table a2 ; the differences are @xmath147 = 32% at 12  @xmath3 m , 26% at 25  @xmath3 m , 25% at 60  @xmath3 m  and 31% at 100  @xmath3 m .",
    "can these variations be attributed to the stellar variability ?",
    "the huge variations in mira variables at visible wavelengths are due largely to the changing photospheric temperature ; the variation in the bolometric magnitude is much smaller , about a factor of 2 ( e.g. petit 1982 ; hoffmeister et al .",
    "1985 ) . because of the variation in stellar effective temperature , the star reaches maximum light later at longer wavelengths in the visible and near infrared ( e.g. le bertre 1992 ) .",
    "in particular , the variation at visible wavelengths leads the total light variation by about 0.1 of a period .",
    "the two groups of observations in table a1 were thus made close to maximum and minimum luminosity .",
    "we modeled the object as a star with a circumstellar envelope and varied the luminosity of the model star .",
    "the envelope contains silicate grains , has a dust loss rate of @xmath148  y@xmath9 and is assumed to have the same outflow speed as the gas ( 9.5 @xmath149 ) .",
    "the star is assumed to be a black body of temperature 2400 k and luminosity 3000  @xmath150 at minimum , and 2800 k and 6000  @xmath150 at maximum .",
    "the resulting model flux densities are listed in table a2 and are reasonably close to the observed values ( note that the discrepancy at 12  @xmath3 m may be caused in part by the saturation of the detectors at these flux densities exceeding 1000  jy ) .",
    "the variation in the iras flux densities can thus be fully explained by the stellar variability .",
    "these results show that caution is required in the interpretation of iras data for variable stars ; colors must be calculated from data taken at the same epoch , as should models of the circumstellar envelope .",
    "variability introduces a significant amount of scatter into the iras colors , especially @xmath40 - [ 25]$ ] , which as a result does not provide the clean measure of the stellar mass loss rate which the models predict ( see , for example , the discussion by habing 1996 ) .",

    "<S> it is the purpose of this paper to rediscuss the circumstellar properties of s stars and to put these properties in perspective with our current understanding of the evolutionary status of s stars , in particular the intrinsic / extrinsic dichotomy . </S>",
    "<S> this dichotomy states that only tc - rich ( ` intrinsic ' ) s stars are genuine thermally - pulsing asymptotic giant branch stars , possibly involved in the m  s </S>",
    "<S>  c evolutionary sequence . </S>",
    "<S> tc - poor s stars are referred to as ` extrinsic ' s stars , because they are the cooler analogs of barium stars , and like them , owe their chemical peculiarities to mass transfer across their binary system .    </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , an extensive data set probing the circumstellar environment of s stars ( iras flux densities , maser emission , co rotational lines ) has been collected and critically evaluated . </S>",
    "<S> this data set combines new observations ( 9 stars have been observed in the co @xmath0 line and 3 in the co @xmath1 line , with four new detections ) with existing material ( all co and maser observations of s stars published in the literature ) . </S>",
    "<S> the iras flux densities of s stars have been re - evaluated by co - adding the individual scans , in order to better handle the intrinsic variability of these stars in the iras bands , and possible contamination by galactic cirrus .    in the ( @xmath2 , [ 25 ] - [ 60]$ ] ) color - color diagram </S>",
    "<S> , s stars segregate into five distinct regions according to their tc content and zro / tio , c / o and ir spectral indices . </S>",
    "<S> stars with photospheric colors ( populating ` region a ' ) may be identified with extrinsic s stars . for the other regions characterized by different excess levels in the 12 , 25 and 60 @xmath3 m bands , several diagnostics ( like the iras spectral class , maser emission , and shape of co rotational lines ) </S>",
    "<S> have been collected to infer the physical properties of the dust shell . </S>",
    "<S> a simple radiative - transfer code has also been used to infer the chemical nature ( carbonaceous or silicate ) of the dust grains from the observed ir colors . </S>",
    "<S> s stars with large @xmath2 $ ] excesses and moderate [ 25 ] @xmath4 [ 60 ]  excesses ( populating regions b and c ) exhibit the signatures of oxygen - rich shells ( 9.7 @xmath3 m silicate emission and sio maser emission ) . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is less clear for s stars with small @xmath2 $ ] and moderate @xmath5-[60]$ ] indices ( populating regions d and e ) . </S>",
    "<S> their ir colors are consistent with carbonaceous grains ( as is their featureless iras spectrum , and absence of silicate or sio maser emission ) , but these features may equally well be explained by a detached shell . for many of these stars with a large 60  @xmath3 m excess , </S>",
    "<S> the shell is indeed resolved by the iras beam at 60 @xmath3 m . </S>",
    "<S> the prototypical sc star fu mon is among these . since sc stars are believed to be in a very short - lived evolutionary phase where c / o = 1 within 1% , fu  mon may be a good candidate for the ` interrupted mass - loss ' scenario advocated by willems & de jong ( 1988 ) . the co line profile of fu mon is also peculiar in being quite narrow ( @xmath6  km  s@xmath7 ) , suggesting that the mass loss has just resumed in this star .    </S>",
    "<S> mass loss rates or upper limits have been derived for all s stars observed in the co rotational lines , and range from @xmath8  y@xmath9 for extrinsic s stars to @xmath10  y@xmath9 ( the mira s star w  aql ) . </S>",
    "<S> these mass - loss rates correlate well with the @xmath2 $ ] color index , which probes the dust loss rate , provided that @xmath11  y@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> small mass - loss rates are found for extrinsic s stars , consistent with their not being so evolved ( rgb or early - agb ) as the tc - rich s stars . </S>",
    "<S> this result does not support the claim often made in relation with symbiotic stars that binarity strongly enhances the mass - loss rate .    </S>",
