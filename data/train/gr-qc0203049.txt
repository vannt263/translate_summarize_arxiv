    "the theory of general relativity predicts the deflection of light in presence of a mass distribution .",
    "a. einstein in 1936 @xcite noted that an image due to the deflection of the light of a background star by another star can have a great magnification if the observer , the lens , and the source are highly aligned .",
    "he also pointed out that the angular separation of the images was too small to be resolved by the optical telescopes available at that time .",
    "+ it was the discovering of quasars in 1963 which opened the possibility of really observing gravitational lensing effects .",
    "quasars are very bright objects , located at cosmological distances , and have a central compact optical emitting region .",
    "when a galaxy is interposed in the line of sight to them , the resulting gravitational magnification can be large and the images are well separated in some particular cases . in 1979 the first example of gravitational lensing was discovered ( the quasar qso 0957 + 561 a , b ) .",
    "+ the weak field theory of gravitational lensing , developed , among others , by y. g. klimov , s. liebes , s. refsdal , r. r. bourassa , and r. kantowski , has been successful in explaining the astronomical observations up to now .",
    "this theory is based on a first order expansion of the small deflection angle ( for a detailed treatment see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "+ when the lens is a very compact object ( e.g. a black hole ) the weak field approximation is no longer valid .",
    "virbhadra and ellis recently studied the strong field situation @xcite .",
    "they obtained the lens equation using an asymptotically flat background metric and analyzed the lensing by a schwarzchild black hole in the center of the galaxy using numerical methods . besides the primary and secondary images , they found that there exist two infinite sets of faint relativistic images .",
    "fritelli et al .",
    "@xcite found an exact lens equation without any reference to a background metric and compared their results with those of virbhadra and ellis for the schwarzchild black hole case .",
    "bozza et al .",
    "@xcite obtained analytical expressions for the positions and magnification of the relativistic images using the strong field limit approximation .",
    "+ in this paper we study the lensing situation when the lens is a slowly rotating kerr - newman black hole . the introduction of charged bodies in the strong - field lensing theory is justified since charged black holes are thought to be final result of the catastrophic collapse of very massive ( @xmath0 @xmath1 ) magnetized stars .",
    "although selective accretion from the surroundings would neutralize the charged black hole if it is located in a high - density medium , there remains the possibility that if the kerr - newman hole is surrounded by a co - rotating , opposite charged magnetosphere , it might not discharge so quickly .",
    "such a configuration would present zero net charge from infinity and consequently it could survive for a significant time span ( @xmath2 yr ) if located in a low density environment @xcite . moreover , the magnetosphere would have observational effects due to particle acceleration in electrostatic polar gaps , similar to those presented by pulsars @xcite . the relativistic wind created by the kerr - newman black hole could be responsible for detectable gamma - ray emission @xcite .",
    "hence , the study of other possible observational signatures from charged black holes presents particular interest .",
    "+ in sec . 2 of this paper",
    "we introduce the basic equations using the reissner - nordstrm s metric for the black hole and a flat background metric . the reissner - nordstrm case can be used also to study slowly rotating kerr - newman black holes .",
    "highly rotating objects break the spherical symmetry introducing unnecessary complications in the lensing calculations , which do not lead to qualitatively different results . in sec .",
