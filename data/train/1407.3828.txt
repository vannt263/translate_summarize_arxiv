    "hybrid quantum networks that combine different physical systems are one approach to achieving the varied functions needed in photonic quantum information processing systems  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the disparate components of such a quantum network may not share the same spectro - temporal properties , leading to an intrinsic incompatibility that can only be overcome via an `` adaptation interface . '' for example , single photon sources based on single quantum emitters like inas quantum dots  @xcite , nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond  @xcite , and neutral alkali atoms  @xcite exhibit desirable features such as on - demand generation with the potential for high single photon purity . to interface the emission wavelengths below 1000  nm with the low - loss telecommunications band ,",
    "quantum frequency conversion interfaces  @xcite have been proposed and developed , both in bulk and on - chip geometries . however , wavelength incompatibility is not the only challenge that needs to be overcome .",
    "while the temporal waveform of such two - level quantum emitters is typically a few nanosecond mono - exponential decay , telecommunications networks are better suited to gaussian and square pulses that are much shorter in duration .",
    "moreover , the bandwidth of quantum memories that are an integral part of the quantum repeater protocol may be either broader or narrower than the bandwidth of the photons  @xcite .",
    "spectro - temporal shaping of single photons , while preserving their quantum nature , is thus a vital tool for hybrid quantum networks  @xcite .    here , we simultaneously frequency translate and convert the spectrum of a mono - exponentially decaying pulse to that of a shorter lorentzian wavepacket .",
    "the core of this approach is frequency conversion using a spectrally chirped pump in a nonlinear medium  @xcite .",
    "we focus on classical input pulses with a mono - exponential decay in the nanosecond regime , mimicking the emission of the aforementioned single quantum emitters .",
    "we demonstrate spectral broadening of such waveforms using a variation of a setup previously used in nearly background - free quantum frequency conversion of single photon from a semiconductor quantum dot  @xcite .",
    "our results complement recent work on spectral compression of single photons through nonlinear wave mixing  @xcite .",
    "moreover , they constitute the first step towards complete spectro - temporal waveform shaping as proposed by kielpinski and colleagues  @xcite .",
    "we highlight the experimental requirements for this , by calculating the spectral phase correction that would need to be applied to our output field to achieve temporal pulse compression .",
    "there are several contexts in which spectro - temporal control of single photon wavepackets has been demonstrated .",
    "three - level atoms enable waveform shaping during single photon generation  @xcite , while photon echo quantum memories have been used for pulse compression and decompression  @xcite .",
    "photons with sufficiently broad spectral bandwidths are amenable to pulse shaping techniques based on dispersive optics and spatial light modulators , as has been demonstrated for ultrafast biphoton wavepackets  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , for single photon emitters such as quantum dots , trapped atoms , or nitrogen vacancy centers , the emission bandwidth is too narrow ( @xmath1 ghz ) for typical line - by - line shaping . for such systems ,",
    "spectral broadening has to precede temporal waveform shaping .    for arbitrary waveform shaping , controlling both",
    "the temporal phase ( to change the spectral shape ) and the spectral phase ( to control the temporal waveform ) is needed .",
    "an approach to doing so , outlined in ref .",
    ", starts by imparting a temporal phase on an incoming single photon wavepacket to convert the input spectrum to the desired output spectrum .",
    "this is followed by spectral phase compensation to remove the unwanted accumulated spectral phase , and convert the temporal waveform to the desired output temporal shape .    the temporal phase manipulation step , shown schematically in fig .  [ fig : fig1](a ) , is the focus of this paper . here , an incoming single photon pulse is mixed with a strong , phase - modulated classical pump pulse in a nonlinear crystal .",
    "the frequency of the pump is chosen to convert the photon to the desired output wavelength , while the temporal phase is imprinted across the frequency converted single photon . by correctly choosing the temporal phase ,",
    "it is possible to convert the input spectrum into any desired output spectrum through the properties of fourier transforms :    @xmath2    when the output spectrum is broader than the input spectrum ( temporal compression ) , the method of stationary phase can produce an analytical solution for the temporal phase @xmath3 . for converting a mono - exponentially decaying input @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the heaviside step function , to a gaussian @xmath6 , we have @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the inverse error function  @xcite . while ref",
    ".   considers large temporal compression ratios ( @xmath9100 ) , we focus on more modest ratios we can achieve experimentally ( @xmath10 ) . here , this @xmath3 produces a spectrum more closely matching a temporal lorentzian , resulting from using the method of stationary phase outside of its strict domain of validity .",
    "the addition of a temporal phase can not modify the temporal profile , so that even though the output waveform has the desired spectrum , its time - domain waveform is unchanged due to an extra spectral phase imprinted on the output pulse .",
    "this unwanted spectral phase can be extracted numerically ( by comparing the spectral output of the nonlinear mixing stage to that of a transform - limited pulse ) . if the broadening in the first step increases the bandwidth sufficiently , standard spatial light modulator pulse shaping techniques ( as in refs .  )",
    "may be used for spectral phase compensation , so that at the output , the pulse should have both the desired temporal and spectral profiles .",
    "in the experiment , we demonstrate spectral waveform shaping of classical light pulses compatible with the single photon regime .",
    "we target a mono - exponentially decaying pulse in time ( a lorentzian spectrum ) of various durations ( 1  ns to 30  ns , spanning spontaneous emission lifetimes ranging from inas / gaas quantum dots to trapped atoms , respectively ) and spectrally shape it to match the spectrum of a compressed lorentzian wavepacket in time ( mono - exponential decay in frequency ) , while simultaneously shifting the wavelength .",
    "the lorentzian shape has been chosen because the required phase profile can be implemented with the available resources , where the main limitation is the 4  ghz sampling rate of our arbitrary - waveform generator and resulting number of phase points across the pulses .        to start , an exponentially decaying pulse that mimics the temporal profile of a single quantum emitter",
    "is generated by passing an attenuated 980  nm laser through an intensity electro - optic modulator ( eom ) driven by an arbitrary waveform generator ( awg ) ( fig .",
    "simultaneously , the second channel of the awg drives a phase eom and imprints the desired phase on the 1550 nm pump .",
    "the pump is subsequently amplified via an erbium - doped fiber amplifier and combined with the 980  nm pulses in a ppln waveguide .",
    "sum frequency generation yields 600  nm light whose spectrum is broadened and shaped into the spectrum of a lorentzian pulse in time . the wall - to - wall conversion efficiency ( which includes input and output coupling losses )",
    "is estimated to be @xmath11  @xcite with a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath0 , as described in ref .  , where quantum frequency conversion with a true single photon source was performed , establishing that the measurements shown below can be directly extended to the single photon regime .",
    "the initial 980  nm spectrum is measured by a fabry - perot ( fp ) analyzer with 10  ghz free spectral range and finesse @xmath12 100 .",
    "the 980 nm  pulse is then switched into a delay line , so that inside the ppln waveguide , its starting edge is matched with the temporal phase carried by the pump .",
    "the ppln output goes through a pair of prisms and a 750  nm short pass filter to remove residual and frequency doubled pump light , and the upconverted signal at 600  nm is analyzed via a second fp ( 10  ghz free spectral range and finesse @xmath12 100 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2 ] shows the data for spectral shaping of a 10 ns mono - exponentially decaying pulse , similar to that expected for the nitrogen vacancy center in diamond  @xcite ) to the spectrum of a 1 ns lorentzian ( a mono - exponential decay in frequency ) .",
    "the input optical pulse is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) , while the temporal phase function needed for shaping is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) .",
    "as this phase function exceeds @xmath13 half way through the pulse , and the awg / eom can supply a maximum of @xmath13 phase , the phase is wrapped around near the @xmath13 point .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2](c ) shows the measured spectrum for the initial 980  nm pulse , a lorentzian in which the two superimposed peaks result from the pulse repetition rate ( 40  mhz ) , and subsidiary shoulders are due to imperfections in the fp response .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2](d ) shows the measured spectrum of the frequency converted signal .",
    "the black line is the theoretically calculated spectrum for the 10  ns to 1  ns spectral broadening and shaping , given the input 980  nm pulse and applied temporal phase .",
    "the red points are the experimental data measured via the second fp analyzer .",
    "the peaks in the frequency converted 600  nm spectrum are due to the 40  mhz pulse repetition rate .",
    "the envelope of these peaks matches the theoretical curve ( which does not include the repetition rate ) well .",
    "this agreement can be quantified by an overlap integral ( @xmath14 ) between the data ( @xmath15 ) and theory ( @xmath16 ) , defined as :    @xmath17    including the pulse repetition rate and fp response , we find @xmath18 , indicating some success in this spectral shaping approach  @xcite .",
    "deviation from @xmath14=1 is likely due to a number of factors , including the limited sampling rate of our awg and the corresponding distortions it causes in the applied phase , particularly in the wrapping around points ( when the phase reaches 2@xmath19 ) .",
    "one feature of this spectral shaping approach is the ability to configure it to convert a variety of different input spectra to desired output spectra . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] we demonstrate the spectral broadening and shaping of input pulse durations that are consistent with those measured for other single quantum emitters . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](a ) , we show the conversion of a 6  ns decaying pulse , similar to that of organic dye molecules used as single photon sources  @xcite , to the spectrum of a 0.5  ns lorentzian pulse . in fig .",
    "3(b ) , we show the conversion of the spectrum of a 1  ns pulse , similar to that from quantum dot single photon sources  @xcite , to the spectrum of a 250 ps pulse , which is at the lower limit of output pulse duration that can be achieved given the sampling rate of our awg .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ]",
    "to move from spectral shaping to temporal shaping , residual spectral phase must be removed from the generated pulse , and can be done by a number of techniques  @xcite . here",
    ", we provide numerical calculations of the full spectro - temporal waveform shaping protocol .",
    "we target compression of a 1  ns mono - exponential decay ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](a ) , blue line ) to a 250  ps ( full - width at half - maximum ) temporal lorentzian ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](d ) , black dashed line ) .",
    "first , we calculate the appropriate temporal phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](a ) , red line ) to create the spectrum of the 250  ps lorentzian ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](b ) ) . achieving flat phase across this spectrum requires a spectral phase correction function that is highly oscillatory . a smoothed function that should be easier to implement in practice",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](c ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig4](d ) shows the resulting temporally compressed waveform ( red line ) , along with the waveform that would be generated if perfect spectral phase correction is achieved ( blue dotted line ) .",
    "both of these curves are distorted from the target 250  ps lorentzian ( black dashed line ) , indicating that the spectral phase compensation and temporal phase application steps are not ideal .",
    "this is due to various approximations used , such as the method of stationary phase and our choice of smoothly varying functions .",
    "the resulting compressed waveform has a full - width at half - maximum of @xmath9  310  ps , indicating that despite the distortion , a significant temporal re - shaping and compression is feasible .        in summary , we have implemented the first stage of a proposal for quantum waveform shaping  @xcite , where nonlinear mixing of an input mono - exponentially decaying pulse with a phase - modulated pump simultaneously translates the wavelength of the pulse and spectrally broadens and shapes it to match a desired output spectrum .",
    "this approach is compatible with single photons and adds to the toolkit of resources being developed for applications in photonic quantum information science .",
    "conversion efficiency is taken as the ratio of frequency converted photon flux to input photon flux , taking into account the quantum efficiency of the single photon counter at the two wavelengths .",
    "the uncertainty is the one standard deviation value and is due to fluctuations in the detected count rate .",
    "the uncertainty in the overlap integral is due to possible temporal misalignment between the 1550  nm and 980  nm signals in the ppln waveguide .",
    "we estimate this to be @xmath20250  ps ( one standard deviation value ) ."
