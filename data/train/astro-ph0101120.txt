    "very high energy @xmath0-ray astronomy ( vhe defined as the energy range of 200 gev - 50 tev ) has extended the photon spectrum of high energy astrophysics of galactic and extragalactic sources through adding a new observational window .",
    "imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes have taken the lead in this energy range because of their large collection area ( @xmath1 ) , good sensitivity , high angular resolution , good energy resolution and low energy threshold ( ong 1998 ) .",
    "the scientific objectives for exploring the universe with vhe photons can be summarized as follows :    i. one of the long standing prime objectives for vhe @xmath2-ray astronomy is to find the sources of cosmic rays .",
    "cosmic rays can be traced through their interactions with matter and subsequent @xmath0-ray emission via @xmath3 production . where and how does nature accelerate particles to energies that extend to @xmath4  ev and beyond ?",
    "the sky above 10 gev is still largely unexplored .",
    "this is one of the last regions of the astrophysical electromagnetic spectrum with the benefit of the unknown - less than a percent of the sky has been scanned with highly sensitive level . ]",
    "vhe telescopes .",
    "it is important to realize that vhe @xmath0-ray telescopes enter a regime of particle physics phenomena that is complementary to accelerator laboratories : a ) annihilation lines from supersymmetric particle decays constitute an exciting possibility for astroparticle physics .",
    "b ) probing quantum gravity effects of photons traveling cosmological distances have been suggested ( amelino - camelia et al .",
    "1998 ; biller et al 2000 ) .",
    "c ) also searches for primordial black holes with future imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes have been revived ( krennrich , le bohec & weekes 2000 ) .",
    "\\iii . at lower energies , observations of he @xmath0-rays ( 20 mev - 20 gev ) with the egret telescope on - board of the compton gamma ray observatory , have revealed more than 270 sources ( hartmann et al .",
    "1999 ) : 7 pulsars , 66 high - confidence blazars , 27 lower - confidence blazar identifications , 170 sources not yet identified with known objects ( egret unidentified sources ) .",
    "it is apparent that the high energy universe is not as sparsely populated as early measurements in the 1960s and 1970s with less sensitive first generation space telescopes oso-3 ( kraushaar et al .",
    "1972 ) , sas-2 ( derdeyn et al . 1972 ; fichtel et al . 1975 ) and cos - b ( scarsi et al . 1977 ) indicated .",
    "the future generation space telescope ( gamma ray large area space telescope : glast ) is expected to detect in the order of @xmath5 sources ( michelson et al .",
    "1999 ) , with a wealth of gev @xmath0-ray astrophysics to be explored .",
    "a major objective of vhe @xmath0-ray astronomy is to extend observations of the electromagnetic universe to higher energies , to arrive at a more complete picture of the non - thermal leptonic component in astrophysical objects .    in this paper",
    "i emphasize point i. and elude to the search for evidence for cosmic - ray hadron acceleration in sources and potential sources of vhe @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "recent observations and some selected results relevant to particle acceleration are summarized in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "i discuss the next generation atmospheric cherenkov telescopes , their capabilities and their prospects for establishing astrophysical sites of particle acceleration , in particular sources of nucleonic cosmic - rays .    to date",
    ", imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes provide a source catalog ( table 1 ) consisting of 12 sources ( see also weekes 2000 ) : 2 high confidence plerions , 1 lower - confidence plerion , 2 high confidence blazars , 4 lower - confidence blazar identifications , 3 lower - confidence shell - type supernova remnants . despite the small number of sources at @xmath6  200  gev , some of the observations ( crab , markarian 421 and markarian 501 ) have revealed statistically strong detections level were achieved per night in a few hours of observation ( gaidos et al .",
    "1996 ; quinn et al .",
    "1999 ) . ] with profound and surprising implications .",
    ".tev source catalog : fall 2000 [ cols=\"<,>,^,<,^ \" , ]     the scientific potential for the various science topics can be summarized as follows :    a veritas - like detector with a flux sensitivity of 0.5% of the crab should be capable of detecting crab - like plerions out to a distance of 20  kpc ( see weekes et al .",
    "this will allow a search for synchrotron self - compton dominated plerions ( crab - like ) over 2/3 of our galaxy .    because of the potentially sharp cutoff in pulsar energy spectra an energy threshold of @xmath7 50  gev is desirable .",
    "the excellent sensitivity due to a large collection area and excellent energy resolution of the next generation imaging telescopes holds great promise in resolving the question as to where @xmath0-rays in pulsars originate .",
    "next generation telescope arrays with their arc - minute angular resolution will be capable of mapping the sites of putative cosmic - ray acceleration and correlate them with interstellar matter density and compare them with their x - ray luminosity .",
    "the versatility of telescope arrays allows a wide - field - of - view mode for the study of more extended snrs .",
    "the good energy resolution of arrays will help to measure the energy spectrum from 50  gev to 10 tev .",
    "ultimately a combined spectrum including data from glast and vhe telescopes will be a powerful tool to separate @xmath0-ray emission of ic origin from nucleonic origin .",
    "the intrinsically large collection area of ground - based telescope combined with a low energy threshold and a good energy resolution should allow the measurement of the energy spectrum of the galactic diffuse emission from different regions in the galaxy in the range of 50 gev - tev .",
    "arrays of cherenkov telescopes increase the field - of - view by the use of sub - arrays ( e.g. , veritas : two arrays of 3 telescopes ) .",
    "ground - based cherenkov telescopes have the highest sensitivity to short @xmath0-ray flares from blazars because of their large collection areas .",
    "thus , detailed multiwavelength studies on scales of minutes to hours is the domain of the x - ray and ground - based vhe instruments .",
    "maybe most important will be multiwavelength studies that include the whole @xmath0-ray spectrum from mev energies to ten s of tev and a dense sampling involving glast together with a number of cherenkov telescopes at different geographical longitude .",
    "it is important to realize that observations with the next generation space telescope glast covering 20  mev - 300  gev together with ground - based telescopes ( e.g. , veritas : 50  gev-50  tev ) will provide for the first time a significant overlap in energy .",
    "a cross - calibration between the ground - based and satellite telescopes will allow the derivation of detailed energy spectra over 6 orders of magnitude in energy .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers of this excellent conference and their hospitality .",
    "also many thanks to stephane le bohec , david carter - lewis and trevor weekes for reading the manuscript and olaf reimer for help with a figure .",
