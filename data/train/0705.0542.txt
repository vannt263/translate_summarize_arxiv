    "the ratio @xmath69 is poorly constrained from qcd physics , significantly expanding the theoretical uncertainty on the photon coupling for specific models .",

    "should the admx collaboration increase their sensitivity by at least an order of magnitude as projected @xcite , then axionic galactic dark matter models with either @xmath19 or @xmath122 would be experimentally accessible for all possible values of @xmath69 . for both of these points , near - perfect cancellation can not occur for the range of @xmath69 .    as stated in section",
