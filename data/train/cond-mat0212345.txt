    "the highly degenerate @xmath8-shells of rare earth and actinide ions support a great variety of local degrees of freedom : magnetic ( dipolar ) , quadrupolar , and octupolar . for localized @xmath8-electron systems , these ( and some of their combinations ) are potential order parameters , leading to rich phase diagrams , as for ceb@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "field - induced octupoles are known to influence the shape of the phase boundaries for ceb@xmath7 or prpb@xmath6 @xcite , but it is an outstanding question whether breaking time - reversal invariance with purely octupole order is possible ; recent observations on npo@xmath5 indicate that it may be so @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8-shell multipolar degrees of freedom may also interact and mix with those of other electrons : the unusual heavy fermion behavior of prfe@xmath3p@xmath4 @xcite , and the exotic superconducting phases of pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 @xcite have been tentatively ascribed to pr@xmath0 quadrupole fluctuations .",
    "detailed understanding has been achieved for ceb@xmath7 and some other ce - based systems .",
    "the reason is that ce@xmath0 has only a single @xmath8-electron , and therefore microscopic analysis is here the easiest .",
    "of particular interest is cubic ceb@xmath7 in which the fourfold degenerate @xmath9 ground state supports the full array of 3 dipoles , 5 quadrupoles , and 7 octupoles @xcite . a microscopic analysis",
    "@xcite indicates that octupole ",
    "octupole interactions should not be weaker than quadrupole ",
    "quadrupole interactions , which gives rise to a close competition between different kinds of order .",
    "in fact , if all interactions were exactly equal , the model would be su(4)-symmetrical , which sparked early theoretical interest in the subject @xcite .",
    "the realistic multipolar model is not fully symmetrical , but the nearness of the su(4 ) point is still felt in fluctuations @xcite . whether the ground state of an su(4 ) model is long range ordered , or it is rather liquid - like ( the su(4 ) version of rvb ) , depends on details like the lattice structure , and the range of the interaction @xcite .",
    "the approximate realization of high symmetries like su(4 ) is of current interest for @xmath10- and @xmath8-electron systems alike .",
    "we expect that the result that various multipolar couplings are of the same order of magnitude , holds generally for light rare earths .",
    "the question arises what can we say about @xmath11 systems .",
    "pr compounds show varied behavior . a few examples : prpb@xmath6 undergoes an antiferroquadrupolar transition but it does not order magnetically , though both dipolar and octupolar interactions are thought to be important @xcite . prb@xmath7 has two magnetic phase transitions but the magnetic anisotropy is explained by quadrupolar interactions @xcite .",
    "prba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath12 is the only member of the group ( re)ba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath13 ( re = rare earth ) , which is not a high-@xmath14 superconductor @xcite .",
    "it is suspected that this is related to the little - understood pr ordering transition at 17k , but the connection is not clear .",
    "the parent mott insulator prba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath7 has a similar phase transition at 11k @xcite .",
    "in most compounds , pr is trivalent .",
    "the existence of the dioxide pro@xmath5 shows that it can also be tetravalent @xcite , though this is rare .",
    "the question of the valence state becomes crucial whenever the nature , or the driving force , of pr ordering is in doubt .",
    "for pr - filled skutterudites : the formation of a heavy fermi sea , as seen in prfe@xmath3p@xmath4 and in pros@xmath3sb@xmath4 , is most likely to involve the hybridization of pr @xmath8-states with conduction band states , and consequently deviation from strictly integral valence .    these basic doubts notwithstanding , we propose to study the interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar interactions in localized @xmath8-electron models , and apply the results to prfe@xmath3p@xmath4 and prba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath7 .",
    "we assume the integer valence state pr@xmath0 , and a hund s rule ground state with @xmath15 .",
    "we note that a similar approach was successful in the case of ceb@xmath7 @xcite , though the system is known to possess the features of a dense kondo system .",
    "we envisage a similar study of pr systems .",
    "pr@xmath0 is a non - kramers ion .",
    "it follows that a unique ground state can be reached without breaking time - reversal invariance , either by having a singlet @xmath1 crystal field ground state to begin with , or via the ordering of quadrupolar moments .",
    "prfe@xmath3p@xmath4 undergoes a second order transition at @xmath16 , which is manifested in a susceptibility spike , and a @xmath17-shaped anomaly of the specific heat @xcite .",
    "though at first thought to be antiferromagnetic , the ordered phase is now known to be antiferroquadrupolar . upon",
    "switching on a magnetic field , the transition temperature decreases .",
    "the character of the transition switches to first order at the tricritical point @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and the ordered phase is completely suppressed at @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "these parameters depend on the direction of the applied field .",
    "however , here we consider only the case of a field applied along the ( 100 ) direction .",
    "the question whether the @xmath8-states are itinerant or localized can be posed again .",
    "prfe@xmath3p@xmath4 is one of the few pr - based heavy fermion systems @xcite . though having an even number of @xmath8-electrons per site makes the distinction between large and small fermi surfaces difficult , we take the view that the large fermi sea of heavy @xmath8-electrons competes with a state in which the conduction electrons build a small fermi sea , and multipolar inter - shell interactions are switched on @xcite",
    "this is supported by inelastic neutron scattering finding that the crystal field excitations become sharply defined when the temperature is lowered below @xmath21 .",
    "it follows that we may use a localized @xmath8-electron model to describe the ordered phase and the vicinity of the phase boundary .",
    "we use the crystal field states of the octahedral group @xmath22 .",
    "we note that the icosahedron of the twelve p atoms surrounding a pr site gives a novel tetrahedral component to the crystal field potential @xcite , but we assume that using cubic symmetry labelling is an acceptable approximation .",
    "since the local order parameter is one of the quadrupolar moments , it may look evident that the crystal field ground state should carry a ( spontaneous ) quadrupolar moment .",
    "however , an analysis of the high-@xmath23 behavior of the magnetization curves shows that the level scheme ( ground state)(first excited state ) may be either of the following three : @xmath1@xmath2 , @xmath1@xmath24 , or @xmath25@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "only the last , with the @xmath25 ground state , carries an unfrozen quadrupolar moment which can be ordered by switching on ( arbitrarily small ) intersite interactions .",
    "it was also shown that this choice is consistent with a symmetry analysis of the structural distortion accompanying the antiferro - quadrupolar ordering @xcite .",
    "this latter argument relies only on the assumption of the @xmath25 ground state , and does not refer to the nature of the first excited state .    here",
    "we show that the alternative @xmath1@xmath2 scheme is also capable to account for most of the observed static properties of prfe@xmath3p@xmath4 .",

    "taking it for granted that intersite interactions mix the @xmath2 states with @xmath1 , the possible local order parameters are those appearing in the decomposition @xmath28 the system is capable of either @xmath25 or @xmath24 type quadrupolar ordering , or any ( dipolar or octupolar ) kind of @xmath2 order . in principle , we have to allow for all the corresponding intersite interactions .",
    "however , we neglect the octupoles .",
    "we assume @xmath25-type quadrupolar order and , recalling that the pair interaction has only tetragonal symmetry , and so @xmath29 and @xmath30 are not equivalent , we arbitrarily keep only the @xmath31 term .",

    "this is well understood on the basis of the @xmath53 meaured by esr @xcite .",
    "we would expect that for re = pr , @xmath54 instead , magnetic ordering and , at the same time , tetragonal - to - orthorombic distortion , is observed at @xmath55 for prba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath13 , and @xmath56 for prba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath7 @xcite , exceeding the de gennes estimate by two orders of magnitude .",
    "there must be a mechanism for producing substantially stronger exchange , or a different kind of ordering , or both .",

    "the greater spatial extent of pr @xmath58 orbitals is likely to explain the enhancement of @xmath36 ; correspondingly , we would expect that @xmath59 is even more enhanced , but would probably still fall short of accounting for the observed @xmath60 .",
    "here we suggest that the presence of quadrupolar interactions may explain several features of the magnetic behavior of prba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath7 , and also an additional enhancement of @xmath60 .",
    "all previous works agree that in the level scheme of pr@xmath0 ions , a low - lying quasi - triplet consisting of the tetragonal doublet @xmath61 and the singlet @xmath62 is well separated from the remaining six @xmath15 states , and therefore suffices for modelling ( as far as the pr sites are concerned ) all low-@xmath23 phenomena @xcite . with @xmath63 , ( [ eq : doub ] ) and ( [ eq : sing ] ) would constitute the cubic @xmath24 triplet , but our fits yield @xmath64 , indicating a slight admixture from the doublet derived from @xmath2 .",
    "let us observe that the doublet carries both @xmath65 dipole , and @xmath29 ( or alternatively @xmath66 ) type quadrupolar moment .",
    "if the doublet is the crystal field ground state , the degeneracy can be resolved either by magnetic , or by quadrupolar , ordering .    using ( [ eq : doub])([eq : sing ] ) , and following the procedure of @xcite",
    ", we fitted the high-@xmath23 magnetization curves , and found that the dipole  dipole coupling has a strong planar anisotropy , and there is also a substantial ferroquadrupolar coupling of the @xmath29 moments @xcite .",
    "the latter finding may lead us to ask whether the observed transition is perhaps purely of quadrupolar nature ; however , neutron scattering shows that @xmath60 is indeed a nel temperature , with the @xmath67 ordered moments strongly tilted out of the tetragonal @xmath68-direction @xcite . within the crystal field model ,",
    "it is rather mysterious why the system does not take advantage of the permanent @xmath68-axis moments of the doublet ( [ eq : doub ] ) , and chooses instead @xmath69-plane moments which have to be interaction - induced .",
    "the mean field hamiltonian acting on the quasi - triplet is similar to ( [ eq : meanf ] ) @xmath70 where we allow for two - sublattice antiferromagnetism , but assume ferroquadrupolar coupling . in view of the bilayer structure of prba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath7 , we take @xmath71 . from our susceptibility",

    "we note that a closely related three - state problem was considered by lbero and cox @xcite .",
    "they assume hexagonal symmetry , so their choice of the singlet and the doublet is quite different from ours , but nevertheless , when worked out fully , the results of their mean field theory should basically correspond to what we find .",
