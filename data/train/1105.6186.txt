    "non - hermitian hamiltonian is traditionally used to describe open system phenomenologically .",
    "it has profound applications in nuclear physics , quantum transport , quantum chemistry , as well as in quantum optics  nonhermitianh .",
    "since the discovery of a parity - time ( @xmath0 ) symmetric non - hermitian hamiltonian can still have an entirely real spectrum , extensive efforts were paid to the pseudo - hermitian quantum theory  geyer1992,alim , am37,am38,ahmed , berry , epsheiss , dembowski , heiss40,bender98,bender , benderrpp , mznojil , jones , tateo , mueller , longhi , longhiprl103,ptinoptics , ptinopticspo , klaiman , aguo , jlpt , ghosh , which paved the way to our understanding of the connection between non - hermitian systems and the real physical world . in general , a @xmath1-symmetric non - hermitian hamiltonian has unbroken as well as broken @xmath2-symmetric phases , the phase boundary is referred to as the exceptional points ( eps ) .",
    "studies of the eps were presented theoretically and experimentally over a decade ago  @xcite .",
    "recently , the experimental realization of @xmath0-symmetric systems in optics were suggested through creating a medium with alternating regions of gain and loss  @xcite , in which the complex refractive index satisfies the condition @xmath3 and @xmath0 symmetry breaking was observed  aguo .",
    "one of the characteristic features of the @xmath0-symmetric system is the ubiquitous phase diagram which depicts the symmetry of the eigenfunctions and the reality of the spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the phase separation arises from the fact that although @xmath4 and the @xmath0 operator commute , the eigenstates of @xmath4 may or may not be eigenstates of the @xmath0 operator , since the @xmath0 operator is not linear . in the broken @xmath0-symmetric",
    "phase the spectrum becomes partially or completely complex , while in the unbroken @xmath0-symmetric phase both @xmath4 and @xmath0 share the same set of eigenvectors and the spectrum is entirely real .",
    "recently , the phase diagram of a lattice model has been investigated .",
    "it is shown that the critical point is sensitive to the distribution of the coupling constant and on - site potential  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effect of on - site interaction on the phase boundary of a @xmath0-symmetric bose - hubbard system .",

    "many - particle eigenstates are obtained in aid of the single - particle solutions .",
    "we also construct the metric operator to investigate the hermitian counterpart and observables in the framework of complex quantum mechanics . in nonzero",

    "section [ sec_nonzero_interaction ] is devoted to the case of nonzero interaction .",

    "the bose - hubbard model  gives an approximate description of the physics of interacting bosons on a lattice .",

    "optical realization of two - site bose - hubbard model in coupled cavity arrays and waveguides have been proposed  hartmann , qbec , longhijpb44 .",
    "it is worth noting that non - hermitian bose - hubbard dimer has attracted enormous research attention in recent years  @xcite .",
    "theoretical investigations on two site open bose - hubbard system was firstly presented in  @xcite . for a @xmath0-symmetric non - hermitian bose - hubbard dimer",
    ", the spectrum and the exceptional points were studied in  graefejpa41 .",
    "after that , dynamics in a leaking double well trap described by non - hermitian bose - hubbard hamiltonian with additional decay term was investigated under the mean field approximation  @xcite . through dynamical study of bose - einstein condensed gases , it was shown that imaginary periodic potential may induce perfect quantum coherence between two different condensates  @xcite .",
    "the realization of such open system can be put into practice as a bec in a double well trap , where the condensate could escape from the traps via tunneling .",
    "most investigations mainly focus on the bose - hubbard model with effective decay term in one site.however , it should be noticed that non - hermitian bose - hubbard dimer with complex coupling terms has also attracted some attention , the decay of quantum states could be controlled by modulating the particle - particle interaction strength and the dissipation in the tunneling process  hzhong . on the other hand , the bose - hubbard model with particle loss",
    "was investigated in an alternative way through employing lindblad  master equation @xcite , which phenomenologically describes non - unitary evolution of an open system @xcite .",
    "recently , @xmath0-symmetric quantum liouvillean dynamics is also investigated @xcite . in this paper , we investigate the property of a  non - hermitian hamiltonian in the framework of quantum mechanics .    nevertheless , although there have been no experiments to show clearly and definitively that a finite non - hermitian hamiltonian do exist in nature , many interesting features have been observed in non - hermitian optical systems , such as double refraction , power oscillations , nonreciprocal phenomenon , etc .",
    "so far , most contributions to pseudo - hermitian quantum theory were for the single particle problem .",
    "particularly , a two - mode @xmath0-symmetric non - hermitian bose - hubbard system with an imaginary potential on the edge has been investigated  @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the influence of on - site hubbard interaction , not restricted to a dimer but to two - particle problem of an @xmath5-site bose - hubbard system .",

    "both single - particle solution and the critical point @xmath8 for interaction - free hamiltonian @xmath19  have been obtained explicitly in our previous study  @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to study the influence of the nonlinear interaction on the features of the system .",

    "this result is not surprising since there is at least a pair of energy levels exhibit repulsion characteristic near @xmath8 .",
    "nevertheless , we notice that the derivative of the original non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath53  is always finite , which reveals the essential difference between a pseudo - hermitian hamiltonian and its equivalent hermitian counterpart .",
    "the physics of @xmath78  near the exceptional point is also obvious : the coupling constants of hermitian counterpart  change dramatically with diverging derivatives .",
    "another theoretical interest in non - hermitian @xmath0-symmetric system is that the unitary evolution can be obtained by introducing metric operator . in this section",

    ", time evolution can be expressed in a unitary way and also a fully consistent quantum theory can be established  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the physical observables @xmath97 with respect to the metric operator @xmath72  can be constructed to meet the relation  @xcite    @xmath98    we examine the total particle number operator .",

    "then we conclude that the two types of particle number operators , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , are both observables . besides , the hamiltonian @xmath23 itself and the metric operator @xmath72 are also observables . here , we would like to clarify that @xmath103 and @xmath72 are both hermitian operators , but @xmath31 and @xmath110 are non - hermitian operators .",
    "however , operators @xmath111  and @xmath112  are no longer observables  am37,heiss40,benderrpp , which are proved through a simple illustration in the [ sec_appendix ] .    here",
    "we want to stress that , the term `` observable '' is specific to the non - hermitian quantum mechanics framework , which differs from that in traditional quantum mechanics .",
    "it is still controversial for the interpretation of the observable . as pointed above",
    ", @xmath103 is a good quantum number , or say , the obtained eigenstates of @xmath4 are also the eigenstates of the total particle number @xmath103 .",
    "this guarantees a unitary time evolution if the @xmath72-metric operator inner product is taken .",
    "however , the dirac expectation value of the particle number is not conservative under time evolution , which seems to be expected .",
    "this is basically caused by the fact that the eigenstates of @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian are non - orthogonal under the dirac inner product .",
    "on the other hand , all hermitian operators are observables in hermitian quantum physics .",
    "for example , operator @xmath113  is an observable in hermitian quantum mechanics but not regarded as an observable according to the non - hermitian theory .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth to mention that the observation of the non - hermitian behavior in experiment , e.g. , the power oscillation phenomenon @xcite@xcite , is based on the distribution of dirac expectation value for @xmath113 .",
