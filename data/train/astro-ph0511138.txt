    "differences between the measured surface density of galaxies and the predicted extrapolation of the local luminosity function ( lf ) can be related to changes in the volume element , to evolution of the spectral energy distribution of galaxies , or to the effects of merging .",

    "the excess in number counts over non - evolution models is more pronounced as bluer filters are used ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , modeling optical and nir number counts simultaneously provides additional constraints on galaxy evolution .",
    "@xcite resolved the optical / nir difference in number counts by invoking merging and an enhancement of the star formation rate in galaxies at moderate redshifts .",

    "these models , as well as others ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , had at their disposal shallow or noisy nir count data coming from different sources which often disagree with each other . with deeper observations ,",
    "the discrepancy between nir and optical counts became more pronounced .",
    "a degeneracy between the effects of galaxy evolution and cosmology gives rise to different interpretations even of the same observations .",
    "using data from several authors , @xcite found that a pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) model in an open universe ( @xmath31 ) fits number counts , colours and redshift distributions reasonably well in @xmath0 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath1 and @xmath28 number counts from calar alto deep imaging survey ( cadis ) are better reproduced by passive evolution models than by no - evolution ones , and that an open universe is preferred to an einstein - de sitter ( eds ) , @xmath34 , universe .",
    "totani and collaborators fitted very deep optical and nir data from the hubble deep field ( hdf ) and the subaru deep field ( sdf ) respectively @xcite , including selection effects in the model .",
    "although both data sets were well reproduced with a ple model in a flat @xmath6-dominated universe , optical number counts needed a mild merger rate ( @xmath35 ) , while nir ones were incompatible with merging .",
    "@xcite have fitted the same data as totani et al .",

    "the various interpretations are probably affected by field - to - field variations , as well as by differing data reduction and analysis techniques .",
    "it has been a general trait that models that fit optical data need to be modified to fit the faint end of the nir counts .",
    "one of the key problems revealed by recent , high - quality nir count data is the slope change in nir number counts at @xmath36 ( hereafter , the `` knee '' ) . this feature has been reported by several authors @xcite and is now well established . while ch03 provide a model that reproduces the @xmath8 knee , no model has been yet presented that simultaneously reproduces this nir feature and the counts in blue bands , which do not show a knee at intermediate magnitudes .",

    "after flat - fielding , a _ super - flat _ image could not be constructed from our data because of scattered light from internal optics and saturated stars , which introduced diffuse variable patterns of more than 50% of the sky level over scales of several arcmins .",

    "incompleteness effects are quantified through monte carlo methods : the behaviour of the detection algorithm is characterized studying how it detects an _ a priori _ known source distribution , inserted in known positions in the science frames , or in synthetic images that simulate the noise characteristics of the science ones .",
    "previous studies of this nature find that efficiency and reliability estimates based on synthetic images tend to overestimate the efficiency and underestimate the spurious fraction , probably due to overly regular shapes of artificial sources , and to the fact that the real sky noise is not extrictly poissonian ( bershady et al .",
    "1998 ; ch03 ) . nevertheless , the study with synthetic images is useful to narrow down the range of detect_thresh values for the more detailed study with the science images .",
    "thus , we have measured efficiencies and spurious fractions first on synthetic images ( see  [ sec : synthetic ] ) , and after that , we have carried out a more detailed study of incompleteness effects using the science frames , which is going to be taken as the definitive one for completeness correction (  [ sec : real ] ) . for spurious characterization when using the science images ,",
    "we have slightly modified the method of ch03 (  [ sec : reliability ] ) .",
    "sextractor is more efficient at detecting high surface brightness sources , , compact sources have a higher probability of being found than extended sources at the same magnitude .",

    "bins are defined using the half - light radius of stars in the images , @xmath88 : objects with @xmath89 are `` point - like '' sources , those with @xmath90 are `` intermediate - sized '' objects , and those with @xmath91 are `` large '' objects .",
    "therefore , our efficiency study using science frames measures detection efficiency not only as a function of the source magnitude , but also of its size (  [ sec : efficiency ] ) .",
    "differential number counts are usually corrected for efficiency using the _ efficiency matrix _ , , or the _ efficiency function _ , @xmath92 .",
    "following @xcite , the element @xmath93 of the efficiency matrix is defined as the probability of objects with an original magnitude  to be detected with magnitude : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the number of objects with an original magnitude  which are recovered with magnitude , and @xmath96 is the total number of objects that originally had magnitude .",
    "notice that this definition is independent of the original source distribution .",
    "this is due to the fact that the probability for an object with an original magnitude  to be recovered by sextractor in  only depends on its size , its original input magnitude , and the noise characteristics of the image , but not on the total number of objects with original magnitude .",
    "the efficiency matrix accounts for the incompleteness effects which are intrinsic to the detection algorithm , the flat - fielding and sky - subtraction errors .",
    "depending on the way this matrix is computed , it also can include magnitude errors caused by crowding .    the _ functional efficiency _",
    ", , is usually defined as the fraction of sources detected with magnitude  irrespective of their input magnitude , from the total number of objets that originally had magnitude :    @xmath97    where @xmath98 is the number of sources which are detected with magnitud , while @xmath99 is going to represent the number of sources which originally had magnitude .",

    "the functional efficiency , , is used more often than the efficiency matrix  in number - count studies @xcite , due to the instability which usually arises when inverting  for applying the efficiency correction .",
    "nevertheless , as pointed out by @xcite , the advantage of using  is that it corrects not only for completeness errors due to the loss of sources , but also for photometric errors .",
    "we have corrected number counts for efficiency using the two methods : the efficiency matrix , , and the functional efficiency , , in the study with science frames ; while we have only used the functional efficiency method in the study with synthetic images , because this is only used for a first estimation of the detect_thresh range .",
    "as it will be commented later , the matricial method became very unstable at faint magnitudes when used to correct star number counts for efficiency ( see  [ sec : stargalaxy ] ) .",
    "thus , we decided to apply the definitive efficiency corrections using the functional efficiency  computed with the study with science frames .",
    "nevertheless , the efficiency matrices were essential when we performed our variation of the reliability analysis by ch03 , as described in  [ sec : reliability ] .",

    "we obtained the initial catalogues by running sextractor onto the final @xmath0 and @xmath1 images .",

    "[ sec : reliability ] , we proceeded to count sources by magnitude intervals according to the 3 size groups defined above .",

    "error estimation for both methods is described in detail in appendix [ append : errors ] .",

    "as commented in the previous section , the study of the efficiency and reliability using synthetic images must be interpreted with care , due to the difficulty in reproducing the sky conditions of the image and the profiles of simulated sources , which usually are regular in excess .",
    "so , we must remark that we have used this analysis using synthetic images only to narrow down the range of detect_thresh values for the definitive study with the science images , which is more detailed and trustworthy .    using the artdata package in iraf",

    "firstly , we found the brightest source present in our images , in each one of the three size groups defined in ",
    "[ sec : sourceextraction ] .",

    "no constraints were imposed on the source positions , in order to include the effects of source confusion in the computation of  and .",
    "this process was repeated 50 times for each size group , injecting 2,000 sources in each simulation , for a total of 300,000 objects .",
    "sextractor was run on each simulated image with detect_thresh=0.4 , 0.5 , 0.6 , and 0.7 .",
    "for each simulation , we computed the efficiency matrix , , and the functional efficiency ,  ( see their definitions in  [ sec : sourceextraction ] ) .    in figure [ fig : efficiency ]",
    ", we show the average   from all the simulations , as a function of magnitude and size group , for the four selected values of detect_thresh , in both @xmath1 and @xmath0 bands .",
    "error bars are the quadratic addition of the rms of all simulations @xcite . in all the cases ,",
    "shows a gentle decline , followed by an abrupt drop near the detection limit .",
    "the 50% efficiency magnitudes for a given object size differ by as much as @xmath20.6 mag when changing detect_thresh ; while they are @xmath20.7 mag deeper for point sources than for large objects of the same magnitude .",
    "these trends are similar to those found by ch03 and @xcite .",
    "we have also found that our synthetic frames overestimate the efficiency of sextractor on to the science images , a fact that corroborates what @xcite and ch03 reported . it can be noticed just comparing the 50% efficiency magnitudes obtained using synthetic frames for detect_thresh=0.5,0.7 in @xmath1 ( see the figure [ fig : synthetic ] ) , with the achieved ones using the science frames ( see the figure [ fig : efficiency ] ) .",
    "the sizes of the selected objects were approximately typical for their size groups , except for the object representing the `` intermediate - sized '' objects in @xmath1 , which is large into the range of its size bin .",
    "nevertheless , we have checked that this fact does not underestimate the typical detection efficiency of its size group for magnitudes less than the 70% efficiency magnitude for a fixed detect_thresh . for higher magnitudes",
    ", the curve of the efficiency function would be displaced @xmath117 mag to fainter magnitudes .",
    "but the changes in the results would be negligible in the last significant bin of magnitude ( the 50% efficiency magnitude bin ) , because we have defined bins of 0.5 mag and the effciency drops from 70% to 50% in less than 0.5 mags ( see figure [ fig : efficiency ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can consider that the surface brightness of each selected brightest object represents the typical surface brightness in its correponding size group .",
    "@xmath1-band average  values for point - like objects are plotted in figure [ fig : matrices ] for the four detection threshold values we studied .",
    "errors associated to these matrices are also shown in the figure ; they have been computed in the same way as the  errors .",
    "similar behaviours are seen for the three size groups , and for both filters .",
    "as we have commented above , we corrected number counts for incompleteness effects using the efficiency matrix , , and the functional efficiency , .",
    "the former became very unstable at faint magnitudes when used to correct star number counts for efficiency , as described in ",
    "[ sec : stargalaxy ] .",
    "so , we decided to apply the definitive efficiency corrections using the functional efficiency  only .",
    "the efficiency matrices were useful when we performed our variation of the reliability analysis by ch03 ( see  [ sec : reliability ] ) .",
    "we must remark that the  determination does not depend on the used input source distribution , and thus , it can be used for correcting for completeness whatever the real input distribution is .",
    "but this is not true for , which would have need an input source distribution as similar as possible to the real one . nevertheless , this is not feasible when using science frames , because these images are already very populated by real objects .",
    "an aditional population of inserted objects as large as the original one would crowd the image excessively , and as a result , computed efficiency matrices and functions would overestimate the effects of source confusion . thus , an additional error arises when number counts are corrected using an efficiency function which has been computed with an input source distribution flat in magnitudes ( instead of an input one that reproduces the initial slope of the counts ) .",
    "the efficiency function error that arises at each magnitude bin can be estimated as @xmath118 where  is our efficiency function computed using the flat input distribution of sources , and @xmath119 represents the efficiency function that would be obtained using an input distribution with the initial slope of the counts ( i.e. , the _ correct _ one ) .",
    "we have estimated @xmath119 at each magnitude bin as follows : let us consider an input source distribution identical to the one we detect once the spurious sources have been subtracted for each size group @xmath105 , @xmath120 . as  is independent of the used input source distribution ,",
    "the _ correct _ distribution of sources we are going to detect is @xmath121 .",
    "moreover , if we had used the _ correct _ efficiency function @xmath119 , the detected source distribution would have been the same : @xmath122 .",
    "so , we can deduce @xmath119 from the two previous expressions : @xmath123 we have estimated the error that arises in using  instead of @xmath119 through equations ( [ eq : correctefficiencyfunction ] ) and ( [ eq : errorefficiencyfunction ] ) , and considering the detected source distribution once the spurious have been removed as the input distribution @xmath120 . the maximum error @xmath124 reached in both bands ( and thus in the number counts ) is @xmath125% for magnitudes @xmath126 in each size group , which is less than the total error from statistical counting and efficiency errors using the computed",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath119 determination has itself a high uncertainty which would overestimate efficiency errors , and that arises from the division by @xmath120 in those magnitude bins where we have low statistical significance , and from the accumulation of the errors from @xmath127 and @xmath120 due to the error propagation of equation ( [ eq : correctefficiencyfunction ] ) .",
    "therefore , we decided to ignore this error and use  instead @xmath119 for correcting number counts .",
    "reliability has been characterized using the method described in ch03 , based on that used by @xcite .",
    "it consists on creating two half - time exposured images from exclusive halves of the data . as spurious sources are basically noise correlated structures or peaks that appear in one of the subexposures",
    ", they must appear only in one of the two half - time images , the one that was built including the correponding subexposure . by running sextractor in double - image mode , photometry on both half - time images",
    "is measured at the positions of sources detected by sextractor in the total - time image .",
    "those spurious sources detected in the total - time image will have very different magnitudes when measured in the half - time images , as they have a high probability of appearing only in one of the two half - time images ; while the real sources will have very similar magnitudes when measured in the two half - time images , because they have a high probability of appearing in both half - time images with approximately the same flux .",
    "we must notice here that this method could not be applied to @xmath1 data directly due to their dithering sequence ( see table [ tab : finalimages ] ) .",
    "however , the results obtained through this method in the @xmath0 band can be used for characterizing reliability in the @xmath1 image , as we will comment below .",
    "so the @xmath128 method for characterising sextractor reliability was carried out on the @xmath0 image only , and extrapolated to the @xmath1 image at the end .    in order to identify spurious detections",
    ", ch03 used a signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath129 ) criterion .",
    "hereandafter , we will define the @xmath129 of a source as the ratio between its flux and its flux error measured by sextractor .",
    "the method consists on assuming that all the sources with @xmath129 below a given limit , @xmath128 , in one or in both of the half - time images are considered as `` false detections '' , and hence , rejected from the catalogue .",
    "nevertheless , into this group of sources labelled as `` false detections '' , we will be rejecting sources that actually are spurious detections ( henceforth called `` rejected truly spurious '' ) , and sources that in fact are real objects whose @xmath129 s also obey the imposed criterion ( called `` rejected real sources '' , hereandafter ) . as we increase the value of the imposed @xmath128 , the probability of being rejecting more truly spurious sources increases .",
    "but , at the same time , the probability of being rejecting a real source as a `` false detection '' also raises . there will be a limiting @xmath130 equal to the one of the highest @xmath129 that the truly spurious sources exhibit in the catalogue , so that it rejects most of them from it .",
    "using @xmath131 will not reject more truly spurious , because the majority of them have already been rejected with the lower @xmath130 , but it will reject more real sources as `` false detections '' ( those with @xmath132 ) . this is due to the fact that the population of real sources has higher @xmath129 on average than the truly spurious population , which is mostly related to the sky noise .",
    "therefore , the fraction of rejected truly spurious sources will become constant for values @xmath133 in each detect_thresh , and this constant fraction can be considered as the maximum fraction of truly spurious sources in the catalogue .    for summarizing , for a fixed detect_thresh , low values of the @xmath128 will reject a low number of sources as `` false detections '' from the catalogue , but with a high confidence level in that the majority of them will be truly spurious instead of real sources . on the other hand , high values of the @xmath128 will reject a high number of sources as `` false detections '' , but we will have an unknown mixture of real and truly spurious sources into the rejected group . for @xmath128 values higher than an unknown limiting @xmath134 , the majority of the truly spurious will be labelled as `` false detections '' ( so the number of truly spurious which are rejected will be approximately constant ) , but the number of real sources labelled as `` false detections '' will keep increasing .    moreover ,",
    "when a good discrimination between real and truly spurious sources is achieved for a given @xmath128 , the majority of sources which are rejected as `` false detections '' will be truly spurious .",
    "therefore , they will have very different magnitudes when measured in the half - time images , because a false detection has a negligible probability of being detected in both half - time images with similar magnitudes .",
    "if we plot the histogram of @xmath135 for the rejected sources with this fixed @xmath128 , it will show a bimodal structure , as the majority of the rejected sources are truly spurious .",
    "on the other hand , if the fixed @xmath128 does not distinguish properly between real and truly spurious sources , there will be two populations mixed in the @xmath136 histogram : the rejected truly spurious sources , which will draw the bimodal structure , and the rejected real sources , which will contribute to a narrow single - peaked distribution centered in @xmath137 , because the real sources have a high probability of having very similar magnitudes in the half - time images .    in figure",
    "[ fig : reliability ] , the histograms of magnitude differences between the half - time images for candidate `` false detections '' in the @xmath0 band are drawn with solid lines , for different @xmath128 and for the four detect_thresh values we decided to study ( see  [ sec : synthetic ] ) .",
    "seventeen values ranging from @xmath128=0.2 to @xmath128=10.0 were studied , but we have plotted results which correspond to @xmath128=1.4 , 2.2 , 2.8 , 3.5 , and 4.5 for clarity . when a good discrimination between real and spurious sources is achieved , the histograms show a bimodal structure , as for the lower values of @xmath128 .",
    "conversely , as we raise @xmath128 , sources with higher @xmath129 , and hence with more probability of being real , are classified as `` false detections '' .",
    "this situation is responsible for the single - peaked , centered distributions of @xmath137 in the cases of high @xmath128 .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , selecting the combination detect_thresh-@xmath128 from these histograms is tricky , because histograms evolve from double to single - peaked gradually ; , there is always a population of rejected real sources mixed up with the distribution of rejected truly spurious detections , considered as `` false detections '' by this method .",
    "until now , the selection detect_thresh-@xmath128 was subjective , depending on which histogram seemed to be more double - peaked and populated at the same time .",
    "we have developed a self - consistent procedure for choosing the most adequate detect_thresh-@xmath128 combination in an objective way , in order to minimize the number of real sources which are rejected as `` false detections '' , and to maximize the number of rejected truly spurious sources and also the number of real detections that remain in the catalogues .",
    "the procedure is described in detail in @xcite , so we briefly summarize necessary information for this paper .",
    "the method consists on estimating statistically the population of real sources which is mixed up with the one of truly spurious sources in the histograms of `` false detections '' of figure [ fig : reliability ] . for computing it ,",
    "the following justified assumptions are used in the @xmath0 band :    1 .",
    "the detected source distribution directly obtained by sextractor , @xmath138 , was taken as a first approximation of the distribution of detected real sources , @xmath139 , being @xmath140 the detection magnitude .",
    "the distribution @xmath139 was truncated for magnitudes @xmath141 mag , because 50% efficiency magnitudes are less than @xmath142 mag for all the detect_thresh values we are analysing .",
    "therefore , a source with @xmath143 will have a @xmath144% probability of being a truly spurious detection , and these magnitude bins will not contribute to the real population in the histograms of magnitude differences of figure [ fig : reliability ] .",
    "we have also considered that all the sources at the histograms of @xmath145 that exhibit @xmath146 are real detections .",
    "this is justified by the fact that the poissonian probability of detecting two spurious sources at the same position with the same magnitude at both half - time images is negligible .",
    "once the distribution of real detections compatible with each histogram of magnitude differences is computed for each @xmath128-detect_thresh combination , we can easily estimate the fractions of real sources and truly spurious we are rejecting from the total number of detections , as well as the fraction of truly spurious sources that remain in the catalogue in each case .",
    "notice that we can estimate also the limiting @xmath130 so that using @xmath131 will not reject more truly spurious",
    ". this will be the @xmath128 value from which the number of rejected truly spurious remains constant although we raise it .    in figure",
    "[ fig : reliability ] we have overplotted with dashed lines the estimated distributions of real sources compatible with each histogram of magnitude differences in the half - time images . as @xmath128 increases , the estimated real distribution approaches the corresponding histogram , because most of the rejected `` false detections '' are real sources .",
    "it is remarkable that the widths of these real source distributions ( fwhm@xmath20.4 - 0.7 mag for all the detect_thresh-@xmath128 combinations ) are consistent with the photometric error for sources at those s /",
    "n on the half - time images , a fact that supports their robustness .    in table",
    "[ tab : fractions ] , we have compared the estimated fractions of rejected real sources , rejected truly spurious sources , and truly spurious that are non - rejected ( , that remain in the catalogue ) , for the four values of detect_thresh and five of the seventeen values of @xmath128 we are analysing in the @xmath0 band : @xmath129=1.8 , 2.2 , 2.5 , 7 , and 10 . the procedure for getting the values from table [ tab : fractions ] , the arguments to set the @xmath128-detect_thresh combination of values , and the results are given in detail in eb05 .",
    "thus , we will just explain them briefly here .",
    "firstly , notice that the fraction of truly spurious sources becomes constant for @xmath147 in each detect_thresh in the table .",
    "in fact , it is constant for @xmath148 in detect_thresh=0.4 , for @xmath149 in detect_thresh=0.5 , for @xmath150 in detect_thresh=0.6 , and for @xmath151 in detect_thresh=0.7 .",
    "this means that the maximum number of truly spurious that are rejected in each detect_thresh is reached with the corresponding @xmath152 value .",
    "then , no advantage arises in using @xmath153 .",
    "we have also found that the maximum fraction of truly spurious that are rejected for all the @xmath128 is the same for detect_thresh@xmath1540.6 ( @xmath155% ) , but different for detect_thresh=0.7 ( @xmath156% ) , as you can infer from table [ tab : fractions ] .",
    "therefore , detect_thresh=0.6 seemed to be the limit between two different behaviours in detection .",
    "although the total fraction of rejected truly spurious ( respect to the total number of detections ) is higher if we use detect_thresh@xmath1540.6 than using detect_thresh=0.7 , it can be controlled , and it is possible to reach deeper magnitudes than using detect_thresh=0.7 . with an adequate choice of the @xmath128 ( see table [ tab : fractions ] ) , we can get similar fractions of truly spurious rejections , of real source rejections , and of truly spurious remaining in the catalogues , and increase the number of detections .",
    "thus , we discarded the value detect_thresh=0.7 .",
    "moreover , @xmath128=2.2 gave a good compromise between rejected real and false detections for detect_thresh@xmath1540.6 .",
    "so we finally decided to use detect_thresh=0.6 and @xmath128=2.2 for the @xmath0 filter , and hence , the 50% efficiency magnitude for point - like sources is @xmath157(eff=50%)=24.83 mag ( see figure [ fig : efficiency ] ) .",
    "this selection allowed us to reject @xmath222% of truly spurious sources in the catalogue ( see the values in table [ tab : fractions ] ) .",
    "as the maximum fraction of truly spurious sources for detect_thresh=0.6 was estimated to be @xmath229% of the total number of detections , then its is easily deduced that approximately @xmath27% of the final catalogue are truly spurious detections , the bulk of them at magnitudes fainter than the 50% efficiency magnitude . with this choice , @xmath23% of the real sources",
    "are rejected from the catalogue .",
    "using @xmath128=2.2 in half - time images for rejection , sources considered as real detections have roughly @xmath1583.1 in the total - time image .",
    "as commented previously , this method could not be applied to @xmath1 data directly because it was not possible to obtain two half - time images from the dithering sequence ( see table [ tab : finalimages ] ) .",
    "if we would have created two complementary images without using all the subexposures in the @xmath1 band , these two images would have been exposed less than @xmath159 .",
    "therefore , we would have had a lower confidence in detecting spurious sources than in the @xmath0 band , and we also would have lost the spurious sources corresponding to those subexposures not used for creating the two complementary images .",
    "nevertheless , the results for the @xmath0 filter can be used for estimating the best combination of detect_thresh-@xmath128 for the @xmath1 image as follows .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath0 images had similar flux characteristics , source distributions and poissonian sky noises , and hence , the detection threshold for @xmath0 image should be valid for the @xmath1 image too .",
    "this is because , although @xmath160 is higher in the @xmath1 image , @xmath1 is deeper than @xmath0 , and their efficiency matrices and functions behave similarly ( see figures [ fig : efficiency ] and [ fig : matrices ] ) .",
    "therefore , we use detect_thresh=0.6 for the @xmath1-band also , and obtain a 50% efficiency magnitude of @xmath161(eff=50%)=25.46 mag ( see figure [ fig : efficiency ] ) . in order to establish the @xmath128 for the @xmath1 image",
    ", we have considered that detections only depend on the @xmath129 of the sources once the minimum area has been fixed .",
    "when the @xmath129 of a source is below the fixed @xmath128 , its flux per unit time and area must be lower than the flux that corresponds to that @xmath128 . in eb05 , the equations that relate the flux of a source and its @xmath129 are shown as a function of several image parameters .",
    "this flux can be expressed in units of the sky sigma of the image .",
    "therefore , a source with @xmath128=2.2 in the @xmath0-band with the minimum area and for @xmath162 would have a flux per pixel and per unit time equal to 1.73 times the sky sigma of the total - time @xmath0 image .",
    "extrapolation of this result to the @xmath1 image is justified due to the similarity of @xmath0 and @xmath1 images , and hence we have considered that a source in the @xmath1-band will only be considered a real detection if its flux per pixel is greater than 1.73 @xmath160 of the @xmath1 image , which implies a @xmath128=2.8 for a source with the minimum area in the @xmath1 total - time image .    finally , we used the identified `` false detections''in the @xmath0 band with the selected combination of detect_thresh-@xmath128 for correcting the corresponding catalogue ( extracted using the selected detect_thresh=0.6 ) for spurious detections .",
    "hereandafter , we are going to call `` spurious sources or spurious detections '' to all the `` false detections '' that have been rejected .",
    "as the same method can not be applied to the @xmath1 band , we corrected for spurious detections the @xmath1 catalogue obtained with detect_thresh=0.6 rejecting all the sources with @xmath163 in the @xmath1 total - time image .",
    "our procedure for estimating the distribution of real sources in the @xmath136 histograms is able to fix objectively the detect_thresh-@xmath128 combination which minimizes the number of rejected real sources , maximizing the number of true spurious rejections , and reaching the deepest limiting magnitude at the same time .",
    "in fact , the subjetive selection of @xmath128 by ch03 leads them to remove the 13.7% of the sources with @xmath164 in their data , while we have rejected @xmath165% of sources with @xmath164 , @xmath166% of sources with @xmath167 , and @xmath168% of sources with @xmath169 .",
    "our method allows us to estimate that only @xmath23% of real sources with @xmath170 are rejected from our catalogues .      even at the high galactic latitude of the gws field ( @xmath171=60 ) ,",
    "galactic extinction affects @xmath0- and @xmath1-band number counts .",

    "we note that , contrary to many previous works @xcite , we do not need to introduce ad - hoc populations of star - forming galaxies at intermedite redshifts to explain the observed number counts ; our model counts only comprise galaxies in the local lfs evolved back in time .      as discussed in ch03 , only by adopting a late @xmath259 for ellipticals do the models reproduce the @xmath8 knee . in the context of the number count models we are using",
    ", this feature requires the disappearance , or significant downsizing , of a dominant red population with look - back time at intermediate redshifts .",
    "only the ellipticals can play this role given the @xmath225 lfs .",
    "we searched for alternative schemes which did not involve a late  for ellipticals , by varying either the star formation time scales , the merger recipes , or the extinction .",
    "we found no combination of parameters that simultaneously yields the knee in  _ and _ the lack of a knee in blue counts .",
    "in particular , postulating a specific dusty phase in galaxy evolution at intermediate redshifts barely affects the  counts , and instead introduces features in the blue number counts which are not seen in the data .    the merger rate in hierarchical @xmath6cdm models , and the merger - driven star formation assumed to derive from it in sam models , peaks at @xmath260 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "ellipticals are assumed to result from such mergers .",
    "we conjecture that the knee at @xmath8 in the nir number counts may reflect the onset of this red population of merger origin .",
    "such merger origin can not be properly accounted for by , due to its simplified galaxy formation recipes , in which mergers change galaxy numbers and luminosities , but not galaxy types .",
    "the appearance of the red population needs to be introduced by setting the appropriate .",
    "setting the population to form instantaneously ( ssp model ) helps  mimic the onset of the merger - induced red population by minimizing the phase during which the galaxies contain young stars .",
    "the late ( @xmath261 ) formation of ellipticals predicted by  can be reconciled with the existence of a significant population of evolved galaxies at @xmath262 @xcite .",
    "the mass density of red , dead galaxies at z=1.8 was @xmath216% of the local density @xcite ;  = 1.5 in our number count models reflects such downsizing of the evolved population .",
    "also , the rapid increase in the clustering of high-@xmath10 galaxies toward redder colors @xcite suggests that red sources at @xmath263 trace a cluster population ; our groth number counts predominantly trace a field population , in which elliptical formation may occur later than in clusters .",
    "a similarly late formation for the majority of ellipticals / s0 ( @xmath264 ) is derived from the analysis of color gradients in early - type galaxies in the hdfn using multi - zone single collapse models @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the ellipticals ,  for all the star - forming galaxy classes is poorly constrained in the models . for early spirals , values in the range @xmath265 yield accepable results ; for late spirals , the acceptable range is @xmath266 .",
    "adoption of extinction for all galaxy classes is critical to the success of the model . in particular , we need to assume extinction for ellipticals .",
    "otherwise , the predicted blue counts show a strong feature , at @xmath267 and @xmath268 .",
    "our extinctions ( @xmath9 for @xmath269 galaxies , see  [ sec : modeling ] ) are moderate , if we take into account that precursors of ellipticals may include dusty eros at @xmath270 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "red , massive galaxies at higher redshifts show much higher extinctions ; e.g. , @xmath271 at @xmath272 in the hdf - s @xcite .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , color distributions provide checks on the evolutionary processes of galaxies that can not be obtained from number counts .",
    "we focus on the @xmath273 color , as our observed catalog is most complete in those bands .",
    "the analysis starts with our model with @xmath256 for spirals , and focusses on galaxies with @xmath274 ; similar conclusions are derived from other magnitude ranges .",
    "@xmath273 color distributions for the model and the data are compared in figure  [ fig : colorsbytype]a . clearly , the model distribution is narrower than seen in the data , and it shows a deficit of red galaxies .",
    "photometric errors can not account for the discrepancy , as shown by the dotted distribution in figure  [ fig : colorsbytype]a .",
    "@xcite noted that the color predictions from the models are often too narrow owing to the discrete nature of the modeled populations .",
    "we find that this is the case for spirals ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : colorsbytype]c , where we have plotted early- and late - type spirals together ) and for irregulars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : colorsbytype]d ) .",
    "however , the model distribution for e - s0 is broad ( fig .  [ fig : colorsbytype]b ) .",
    "such width arises from the strong k - corrections of old populations , which appears to be responsible for the width in the observed @xmath273 histogram .",
    "figure  [ fig : colorsbytype ] suggests that the discrepancy between observed and model colors arises from the failure to include red , evolved populations in the precursors of present - day early - to - intermediate type spirals .",
    "possibly , our early - spiral class ( s0/a - sb ) is too broad to account for the range of colors present in galaxies of types s0/a to sb .",
    "the models appear to miss the strong contribution of bulges to the integrated light of early - type spirals .",
    "we are constrained by the morphological classes of the luminosity function defined by nakamura et al .",
    ", hence we can not properly split the early s class . to estimate the potential effects of splitting the early s class , we generate a toy - model in which we simply divide the early spirals in two equal groups . for the first ( `` s0/a - sa '' group )",
    "we assign the formation history corresponding to ellipticals ( ssp solar metallicity , scalo imf , and formation redshift  = 1.5 ) . for the second ( `` sb group '' ) , we assign a formation redshift @xmath275 , an exponentially - decaying sfh with @xmath276 gyr , and solar metallicity .",
    "the color distribution for such model ( figure  [ fig : colorsssplit]a ) , provides a close match to the observed colors , specially when smoothed to account for photometric errors ( dotted line in figure  [ fig : colorsssplit]a ) .",
    "this exercise suggests that the deficit of red galaxies in the model shown in figure  [ fig : colorsbytype]a traces an overly simplified description of the populations in early - type spirals .",
    "the single - age nature of the population might affect as well ; a broad color distribution for the s group would be obtained as well if an important fraction of the precursors of present - day spirals became dominated by old populations earlier than assumed in our models .",
    "finally , we note that splitting the early - s population does not affect significantly to the fits to the number counts .",
    "when the cosmology is changed to an einstein - de sitter model , our  model reproduces the @xmath0 and @xmath1 counts , but fails to reproduce the  counts by a large margin .",
    "hence , the combined number counts in @xmath277 appear to favor a @xmath6-cosmology over an einstein - de sitter one , a result also found by @xcite .",
    "we have presented @xmath0 and @xmath1 number counts from a field of the goya survey that covers @xmath2900 arcmin@xmath3 over the groth - westphal strip .",
    "counts are derived from 0.2350 deg@xmath3 and 0.2467 deg@xmath3 of sky in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "achieved limiting magnitudes ( 50% detection efficiency for point sources ) are @xmath278 mag and @xmath279 mag , in the vega system .",
    "the counts have been corrected for detection efficiency as a function of source size , and for spurious detections , using the method of @xmath129 threshold in two complementary half - time images detailed in @xcite .",
    "star - galaxy separation has been performed using _ hst _ images in the gws and stellarity indexes from sextractor .",
    "counts are given over @xmath280 and @xmath281 .",
    "these wide ranges ( 7 mag in @xmath0 and 6 mag in @xmath1 ) result from the combination of wide area and depth of our survey . in both bands ,",
    "our number counts are in good agreement with other studies that cover fainter and brighter magnitudes .",
    "the slopes of the number count distributions are very similar to those reported by other authors : @xmath282 for @xmath1=21.0 - 24.5 , and @xmath283 for @xmath0=21.0 - 24.0 .",
    "when combined with  number counts , the data provide strong constraints on galaxy formation models , due to the presence of a knee at @xmath8 in the nir counts , and the absence of such feature in blue passbands . adopting a @xmath6-dominated cosmological model ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 km s@xmath42 mpc@xmath42 ) , a simple number count model including luminosity evolution from gissel seds and number evolution as @xmath284 accurately reproduces the observed counts in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and  in a consistent way .",
    "extensive modeling suggests that , only by assuming a moderately low formation redshift ( @xmath259 ) for the dominant nir population ( ellipticals ) does the model reproduce the @xmath8 knee ; while , reproducing the lack of a knee in @xmath0 and @xmath1 counts in turn requires the adoption of a moderate optical depth for all galaxy types , including ellipticals ( @xmath9 for @xmath269 galaxies ) .",
    "neither of the two assumptions is at odds with current ideas on galaxy formation and evolution in hierarchical universes .",
    "future comparison with sam galaxy formation models will tell whether the @xmath256 required by the model reflects , as we suspect , a major epoch of early - type _ field _ galaxy formation through mergers of disk galaxies , rather than the epoch for the formation of the stellar content of ellipticals .",
