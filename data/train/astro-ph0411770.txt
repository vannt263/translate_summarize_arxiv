    "in the low / hard state , the radio spectrum of black hole candidates ( bhcs ) is usually flat or even inverted , which is often taken as evidence for the presence of jets ( fender 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "this is because , on one hand , such a spectrum is characteristic of jets in active galactic nuclei ( agns ; e.g. , blandford & knigl 1979 ) ; on the other hand , it is difficult to explain it by invoking emission from the underlying accretion flow ( yuan , cui , & narayan 2005 , hereafter ycn05 ) .",
    "a strong correlation between the radio and x - ray luminosities of bhcs in the hard state has been found recently ( corbel et al .",
    "2003 ; gallo , fender , & pooley 2003 ) , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the radio luminosity at 8.6 ghz and @xmath6 is the 2 - 11 kev x - ray luminosity .",
    "the correlation extends more than three decades in @xmath6 , from @xmath7 to @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the eddington luminosity ) .",
    "the lowest luminosity is close to the quiescent state luminosity of v404 cyg , but is still much higher than that of typical bhcs ( e.g. , kong et al .",
    "2002 ; mcclintock et al .",
    "the correlation also holds for agns ( merloni , heinz , & di matteo 2003 , hereafter mhd03 ; falcke , krding , & markoff 2004 ) .",
    "it is generally thought that the x - ray emission from bhcs originates in the accretion flows ( see a review by narayan 2004 ) . the observed radio ",
    "x - ray correlation strongly implies a casual connection between the accretion flow and jet .",
    "recently coupled accretion - jet models have been proposed and applied to the hard state of xte j1118 + 480 , a source to which we have almost the best spectral and timing observational results among all bhcs ( ycn05 ; malzac , merloni , & fabian 2004 ) . in these models",
    ", the accretion flow is composed of an inner adaf - like hot accretion flow and an outer standard thin disk ( esin , mcclintock & narayan 1997 ; malzac , merloni , & fabian also discuss the possibility that the x - rays may come from a patchy corona rather than an adaf ) .",
    "an additional jet component is assumed to form at the innermost region of the accretion flow .",
    "the x - ray emission is dominated by the hot accretion flow , while the radio emission comes from the jet .",
    "the accretion - jet models can not only explain the broadband spectral energy distribution of xte j1118 + 480 ranging from radio to x - ray ( ycn05 ) , but also account for most of its complicated timing features ( ycn05 ; malzac , merloni , & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the models can explain the observed radio  x - ray correlation in a quantitative manner , or what constraints the correlation can put on the models .",
    "one critical parameter in the problem is how the fraction of the accreted matter that goes into the jet , @xmath10 , changes with @xmath11 .",
    "unfortunately , no good theoretical constraint can be put on it due to our poor understanding of the jet formation .",
    "assuming @xmath12 is constant , mhd03 find that an adaf - jet model is roughly consistent with the observations at the 3@xmath13 level .    in this paper",
    "we begin by investigating this question again . instead of assuming a constant @xmath12 , we investigate what functional form of @xmath14 is required to explain the radio  x - ray correlation (  2.1 ) .",
    "such a study may supply us with some clue on the jet formation mechanism . in",
    " 2.2 and  2.3 , we investigate what the correlation will be below the lowest observed x - ray luminosity ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "we find that when @xmath16@xmath17 , the radio  x - ray correlation will become much steeper , @xmath18 , and the x - ray emission of the source should be dominated by the jet , rather than by the accretion flow .",
    "there are some uncertainties in the normalization of the observed radio  x - ray correlation ( e.g. , gallo , fender & pooley 2003 ) . without losing generality , in our calculation",
    "we determine the normalization from the observed outburst - state radio and x - ray fluxes of xte j1118 + 480 ( see ycn05 for the observational data ) .",
    "then the observed correlation is expressed as , ( ) = 10 ^ -7.34()^0.7 .",
    "this is shown by the segment `` ab '' in figure 1 .",
    "the point `` a '' corresponds to the outburst state of xte j1118 + 480 , and the point `` b '' the lowest x - ray luminosity to which the observed correlation in bhcs extends , @xmath19 ( gallo , fender & pooley 2003 ) .",
    "the details of the accretion - jet model are described in ycn05 .",
    "briefly , the accretion flow is described as a geometrically thin cool disk outside a transition radius and a geometrically - thick hot accretion flow ( i.e , adaf ) inside the transition radius .",
    "the effect of outflow / convection is taken into account in calculating the dynamics of the hot accretion flow .",
    "the main parameters are @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . near the black hole , we assume that a fraction of the accretion flow , @xmath12 , is transferred into the vertical direction to form a jet",
    ". the half - opening angle of the jet is @xmath22 and the bulk lorentz factor is @xmath23 . within the jet",
    ", internal shocks occur due to the collision of shells with different velocities .",
    "these shocks accelerate a fraction of the electrons into a power - law energy distribution .",
    "the steady state energy distribution of the accelerated electrons is self - consistently determined , taking into account the effect of radiative cooling . following the widely adopted approach in the study of grbs , the energy density of accelerated electrons and amplified magnetic field is determined by two parameters , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which describe the fraction of the shock energy going into electrons and magnetic field , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 are 0.06 and 0.02 , respectively , which are well within the range of typical range obtained in grb afterglows ( see ycn05 for details ) .",
    "we then calculate the synchrotron emission from these accelerated electrons .",
    "of course , like any other jet models published in the literature , our jet model is only phenomenological because the physics of jet formation is still poorly understood .",
    "we calculate the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 at various @xmath11 , adjusting @xmath12 so that eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be satisfied .",
    "the radio luminosity @xmath5 is always dominated by the emission from the jet ( by optically - thick synchrotron emission ) while @xmath6 is the sum of the emissions from the accretion flow ( by thermal comptonization and bremsstrahlung emissions ) and jet ( by optically - thin synchrotron emission ) .",
    "we assume that the intrinsic physics of accretion and jet does not depends on @xmath11 , so all the other model parameters are fixed in the process . since",
    "outflow and convection are taken into account in our model , @xmath11 is a function of radii .",
    "we therefore define @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the accretion rate at 5 schwarzschild radii . when the luminosity is relatively high , such as at the point `` a '' in fig . 1",
    ", @xmath6 is dominated by the accretion flow ( ref . fig . 2 in ycn05 ) .",
    "with the decrease of @xmath11 , however , the contribution of the jet to @xmath6 becomes more and more important .",
    "this is because x - ray emission from the accretion flow scales as @xmath28 with @xmath29 ( see below for details ) , while that from the jet is due to the optically - thin synchrotron emission and thus @xmath30 ( e.g. , heinz 2004 ) .",
    "the radio luminosity is always dominated by the jet .",
    "we find that our results are not sensitive to all the model parameters except @xmath31 , which describes the fraction of the viscously dissipated energy in directly heating electrons in the hot accretion flow ( ycn05 ) .",
    "we first consider the case of @xmath21 , the value required in the detailed modeling of sgr a * by a most updated adaf model ( yuan , quataert & narayan 2003 ) .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "2 shows the dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath11 .",
    "we can see from the figure that in this case to fit the radio  x - ray correlation , @xmath12 must be a strongly decreasing function of @xmath11 . if @xmath32 , the predicted radio  x - ray correlation index would be @xmath33 .",
    "this seems to be at odds with the result of mhd03 .",
    "we find that the discrepancy is mainly due to their adoption of a smaller @xmath31 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "following the notations in mhd03 , if @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 is the x - ray luminosity emitted from the accretion flow ) , the correlation index @xmath38 ( @xmath39 : see heinz & sunyaev 2003 ) , if @xmath12 is assumed to be constant .",
    "mhd03 find that @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "we do the calculations using @xmath41 and find that our result is in general agreement with mhd03 .",
    "but for @xmath21 , we find @xmath42 , and @xmath43 for @xmath11 in the ranges of ( @xmath44 ) and @xmath45 in units of @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the reason for the difference in @xmath46 for different @xmath31 is as follows .",
    "the value of @xmath37 depends on the density @xmath47 and temperature @xmath48 . with the decreasing of @xmath11 ,",
    "the density decreases but @xmath48 increases . for larger @xmath31 , @xmath48 increases faster",
    "thus @xmath46 is smaller . for comparison",
    ", we also calculate the case of @xmath49 and find that @xmath12 is nearly constant . in this case , @xmath50 , so the correlation index @xmath51 for a constant @xmath12 , which is very close to 0.7 .",
    "another reason for the discrepancy between our result and that of mhd03 is that we take into account the contributions of both the accretion flow and jet ( mhd03 attribute @xmath6 only to the accretion flow ) , which results in a smaller `` effective '' @xmath46 .",
    "the third ( minor ) reason is that we consider the effects of outflow and convection .      in the following",
    "we investigate the correlation below the point `` b '' in fig .",
    "we assume that the jet persists and the physics of jets does not change significantly at low luminosities .",
    "we extrapolate the derived @xmath14 ( which is approximately a power - law ) to lower @xmath11 and calculate @xmath52 and @xmath53 for different @xmath11 .",
    "the segments `` b - c - d '' in fig . 1 show our predicted radio  x - ray correlation at low @xmath11 .",
    "it is interesting to see that below a certain luminosity , represented by the point `` c '' in fig .",
    "1 , the correlation deviate from the extrapolation of the observed radio  x - ray correlation and approach asymptotically the segment `` de '' , ( ) = 10 ^ -4.1()^1.23 . the segment `` de '' shows the correlation of a pure - jet model , with the radio / x - ray emission being due to the optically thick / thin synchrotron emission of the electrons in the jet . the normalization of the segment `` de '' is determined by the results of modeling the outburst state of xte j1118 + 480 ( ycn05 ) .",
    "( the point `` d '' represents the emission from the jet in xte j1118 + 480 at the quiescent state , see fig .",
    "the change of the correlation is because , as we stated above , the contribution of jet to the total x - ray emission is becoming more and more important compared to that of the accretion flow as @xmath11 becomes smaller . below a certain @xmath11 ( the point `` c '' in fig .",
    "1 ) , the x - ray luminosity will be completely dominated by the jet and thus the correlation of the system will follow that of the pure jet model .",
    "this prediction is particularly relevant to the quiescent state of bhcs , because their x - ray luminosity is typically @xmath54 ( kong et al .",
    "2002 ; mcclintock et al .",
    "we will discuss it further in  3 .",
    "the index of the correlation of a pure - jet model is @xmath55 .",
    "this is in general agreement with heinz ( 2004 ) , where he obtained @xmath56 . on the other hand , markoff et al .",
    "( 2003 ) obtained @xmath57 .",
    "we find that the discrepancy is mainly because markoff et al . did not take into account the cooling break in the electrons energy distribution , as also pointed out by heinz ( 2004 ) .",
    "we should note that our results are not very sensitive to the exact form of @xmath12 .",
    "we examine the two cases , @xmath58 0.5 and 0.01 , as well as one in which the value of @xmath12 at the lowest @xmath11 in fig .",
    "2 is used .",
    "we find that the result remains qualitatively the same , although the exact location of `` c '' and the slope of the segment `` bc '' in fig .",
    "1 are slightly different .",
    "so we conclude that the change in slope from `` ab '' to `` de '' is robust .",
    "the location of the intersection point `` c '' mainly depends on the normalization of the two segments . for different bhcs , the normalization of `` ab '' may vary by a factor of @xmath59 ( gallo , fender & pooley 2003 ) . the uncertainties in the normalization of `` de '' have two origins",
    "one is from the jet model for a single source . unlike the accretion flow ,",
    "the jet parameters are not well constrained and there are some degeneracy .",
    "however , we find that because of the excellent observational data of xte j1118 + 480 , the arisen uncertainty in the normalization is not large .",
    "the uncertainty arisen from various sources depends on the diversity in the jet properties such as its velocity .",
    "these quantities are poorly constrained currently , but we feel they should not differ too much among various sources .      while the radio  x - ray correlation index does not depends sensitively on the black hole mass @xmath60 , the contribution of the adaf to @xmath61 could become important when @xmath6 is very low . in this case , the correlation index will become smaller . at frequencies far below 8.6 ghz ,",
    "however , this effect is not important . ] , as shown by heinz ( 2004 ) , the normalization does . to extend our result to agns",
    ", we need the dependence of the correlation on the mass of the black hole . at relatively high luminosities ( above the point `` c '' in fig .",

    "( 1 ) , but with additional dependence on @xmath60 included .    using a jet model , heinz ( 2004 ) investigated the correlation index between @xmath5 and @xmath60 , @xmath62 , and found that @xmath63 .",
    "we use our pure jet model to calculate the value of @xmath62 . , because the basic physics of jet should not depend on @xmath60 , and the dependence of quantities ( such as the frequency of the cooling break ) on @xmath60 have been self - consistently taken into account in our jet code .",
    "] we calculate the radio luminosity @xmath5 at various @xmath60 , adjusting @xmath64 to keep @xmath6 constant , and obtaining the value of @xmath65 .",
    "this result is similar to that obtained by heinz .",

    "jonker et al . ( 2004 ) obtained ( nearly ) simultaneous radio and x - ray fluxes of xte j1908 + 094 during the decaying phase of an x - ray outburst .",

    "given that our predicted value for the correlation index is consistent with the range allowed by the j1908 + 094 data , however , we believe that a more likely scenario for the steeper radio  x - ray correlation is that the x - ray emission of xte j1908 + 094 is already dominated by the jet at the observed x - ray fluxes . if our explanation is correct , the x - ray luminosity of the source would have to be below the critical value ( as indicated by the point `` c '' in fig .",

    "it remains to be seen whether this is the case . at present , the distance to the source is poorly constrained , as pointed out by jonker et al .",
    "we should stress that due to the uncertainty in the location of the point `` c '' , the uncertainty in @xmath74 is significant .",

    "narayan , garcia & mcclintock ( 1997 ; see also mcclintock , narayan & rybicki 2004 ) take this as evidence for the existence of event horizon in bhcs for the following reasons . for neutron star systems , the energy stored in the accretion flow ( adaf ) should eventually be released as radiation upon impacting the solid surface of the neutron star .",
    "the radiative efficiency is @xmath123 .",
    "for bhcs , however , the energy stored in the adaf simply disappear into the event horizon of the black hole , so the luminosity is expected to be much lower .",

    "the main conclusions from this work can be summarized as follows : 1 ) our accretion - jet model developed in ycn05 can re - produce the observed radio  x - ray correlation with index of @xmath132 ( fig .",
