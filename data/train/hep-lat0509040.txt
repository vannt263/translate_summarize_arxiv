    "in ref .   it is emphasized that in studies of the qcd deconfining transition ( or cross - over ) by means of heavy ion experiments , one ought to be concerned about non - equilibrium effects after a rapid _ heating _ of the system .",
    "this is because the heating may be modelled as a rapid quench and the qcd high temperature vacuum is characterized by ordered polyakov loops which are similar to the low temperature phase of analogue spin models .",
    "the subsequent evolution leads to vacuum domains of distinct @xmath1 triality , and one ought to be concerned about non - equilibrium effects .    here",
    "we extend the investigation to su(3 ) lattice gauge theory .",
    "we report preliminary results about the influence of such domains on the gluonic energy density and pressure of pure su(3 ) lattice gauge theory .    the markov chain monte carlo ( mc ) process provides model  a ( glauber ) dynamics in the classification of ref .  .",
    "as a time step a sweep of systematic updating with the cabibbo - marinari @xcite heat - bath algorithm and its improvements of ref .   is used ( no over - relaxation , to stay in the universality class of glauber dynamics ) .",
    "although this is certainly not the physical dynamics of qcd , in the present state of affairs it appears important to collect qualitative ideas about eventual dynamical effects . for this purpose",
    "the investigation of any dynamics , which actually allows for its study ought to be useful .",
    "consider two - point correlation functions defined by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the relevant fluctuation about some average and @xmath4 denotes spatial coordinates .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used and the subscript @xmath5 on the left - hand side reminds us that the average is taken over the spatial lattice . for gauge systems we deal with fluctuations of the polyakov loop , and for analogue spin systems with fluctuations of the magnetization .    the finite volume continuum limit of ( [ e : l0lr_def ] )",
    "is achieved by lattice spacing @xmath6 , @xmath7 with the physical length of the box @xmath8 .",
    "this means that @xmath9 transforms into @xmath10 with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and so on .",
    "we define structure function as fourier transform of the two - point correlation function ( [ e : lolr_contlim2 ] ) : @xmath14 occasionally it is also convenient to use structure functions normalized by the volume : @xmath15 periodic boundary conditions imply : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an integer vector @xmath18 , @xmath19 , etc .    the discretized version of ( [ e : sf2_def ] )",
    "is @xmath20 using definition ( [ e : l0lr_def ] ) and shifting summation on @xmath21 one arrives ( after simple algebra ) at the expression @xmath22 rewriting the product in the exponent as @xmath23 and using definition ( [ e : sf1_def ] ) we shape @xmath24 into the form used in our simulations : @xmath25 as we let system evolve with time quantity @xmath3 becomes time - dependent : @xmath26 .",
    "the time @xmath27 corresponds to the dynamical process , i.e. , in our case the markov chain mc time .",
    "we consider an ensemble of systems ( replica ) and dynamical observables are calculated as ensemble averages denoted as @xmath28 .",
    "then time - dependent structure functions averaged over replicas are : @xmath29 similarly , @xmath30 early time evolution of the structure functions after the quench is governed by the linear theory .",
    "the linear approximation results in the following equation for the structure function : @xmath31 with the solution @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a critical momentum .",
    "originally the linear theory was developed for model  b @xcite .",
    "details for model  a can be found in ref .  .",
    "during our simulations the structure functions are averaged over rotationally equivalent momenta and the notation @xmath34 is used for the structure function at momentum @xmath35 the @xmath34 are called structure function modes or structure factors .",
    "we recorded the modes ( including the permutations ) @xmath36 : @xmath37 , @xmath38 : @xmath39 , @xmath40 : @xmath41 , @xmath42 : @xmath43 , @xmath44 : @xmath45 , @xmath46 : @xmath47 , @xmath48 : @xmath49 , @xmath50 : @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 : @xmath54 , @xmath55 : @xmath56 , @xmath57 : @xmath58 , @xmath59 : @xmath60 , @xmath61 : @xmath62 , @xmath63 : @xmath64 , @xmath65 : @xmath66 , @xmath67 : @xmath68 , @xmath69 : @xmath70 , @xmath71 : @xmath72 .",

    "( fk ) cluster definition can be used to exactly remap the phase transition into a percolation model . in case of the 3d 3-state potts model the states substitute for the @xmath1 trialities of su(3 ) lattice gauge theory . in the cluster language",
    "the competition of distinct vacuum domains can be made visible  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig_qnch_3d_geom3d ] we compare the evolution of geometrical and fk clusters for a quench of the 3d 3-state potts model from its disordered into its ordered phase .",
    "we plot the evolution of the largest clusters for the three potts magnetizations in zero external magnetic field @xmath113 .",
    "while the system grows competing fk clusters of each magnetization before one becomes dominant , geometrical clusters do not compete .",
    "this picture is unfavorable for the use of geometrical clusters of polyakov loops in gauge theories , for which the fk definition does not exist .",
    "the process of competitions between the largest fk clusters of different magnetization leads for the proper transition ( @xmath114 ) to a divergence of the equilibration time in the limit of infinite systems , an effect known in condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "potts studies @xcite with an external magnetic field show that a major slowing down effect survives when @xmath115 is sufficiently small . as",
    "the influence of an external magnetic field on the potts model is similar to that of quarks on su(3 ) gauge theory this indicates that the effect may be of relevance for qcd studies of the crossover region .",
    "although a satisfactory cluster definition does not exist for gauge theories , the underlying mechanism of competing vacuum domains is expected to be similar as in the spin models . to study its influence on the gluonic energy @xmath116 and pressure @xmath117 densities , we calculate these quantities at times @xmath118 .",

    "@xmath125 are defined by : @xmath126    they are related to the qcd @xmath127-function and can be calculated using pade fits of ref .  .",

    "to normalize to zero temperature , plaquette values from the symmetric @xmath128 lattice are needed in eq .",
    "( [ e : eminus3p ] ) . as one stays within the confined phase on the symmetric lattice its equilibration after the quench is fast .",
    "therefore it is enough to use equilibrium values of @xmath123 ( at final @xmath129 ) after the quench .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_su3subtract ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_geds ] we report how the time needed for equilibration increases with lattice size .",
    "we compare the evolution of the gluonic energy density on lattices @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath85 . a slowing down of the equilibration is found , which appears to be related to the divergence of the time needed to reach the structure factor maxima .",
    "finally , we compare in fig .  [ fig_su3ged_2hists ] for the @xmath130 lattice the gluonic energy distribution in equilibrium at @xmath131 with the one obtained after 148 time steps .",
    "we find a shift towards lower gluonic energies and the width of the probability density is slightly broader for the time evolution after the quench than in equilibrium .",
    "one also has to take into account that the geometry of relativistic heavy ion experiments experiments is reasonably approximated by @xmath132 , @xmath81 , rather than by @xmath133 , @xmath81 .",
    "using the evolution of structure function modes , we identify spinodal decomposition as the transition scenario for quench from the disordered into the ordered phase of su(3 ) lattice gauge theory and the analogue potts model .",
    "we observe an early time development of structure factors @xmath134 , which is in over - all agreement with the exponential growth predicted by the linear theory of spinodal decomposition for @xmath135 . from our data",
    "the critical mode @xmath98 is estimated .",

    "maxima diverges . relying on a study of fortuin - kasteleyn clusters in potts models @xcite",
    ", we assume that the reason for the slowing down is due to competing vacuum domains . for su(3 )",
    "gauge theory these are domains of distinct @xmath1 trialities",
    ". they may be the relevant vacuum configurations after the heating quench in relativistic heavy ion collision experiments .",
    "we have initiated a study of the gluonic energy and pressure densities on such configurations .",
    "our data are consistent with a divergence of the equilibration time of the gluonic energy density , similarly to the one observed for the structure factor maxima .",
    "all our results rely on using a dissipative , non - relativistic time evolution , believed to be in the glauber universality class .",
    "the hope is that the thus created non - equilibrium configurations may exhibit some features , which are in any dynamics typical for the state of the system after the quench .",
