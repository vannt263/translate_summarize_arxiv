    "the study and understanding of the dynamics of fields are a timely subject and of broad interest , with applications in diverse areas like in particle physics , cosmology and in condensed matter ( for a recent review , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "additional interest on the subject comes from the fact that many of the theoretical ideas and models can be tested in ongoing experiments , as those been performed in condensed matter systems , and in the future ones , in the entering of operation of the rhic and lhc heavy ion colliders , which will be able to probe possible new phenomena at the qcd scale and space based experiments , which will be putting on test different cosmological models .",
    "it is then becoming urgent the detailed investigation of the underline field dynamics that may be common to all these very different areas of physical research .    in this paper",
    "we are mainly concerned with the connection between the development of strong nonlinearities in the time evolving system of equations of motion of a given field theory model and the possible chaotic behavior associated to them .",
    "lets recall that in symmetry breaking phase transitions we are usually interested in the study of the evolution of a given order parameter , for example the magnetization in spin systems in statistical physics or a vacuum expectation value of some scalar field ( the higgs ) in particle physics , which gives a measure of the degree of organization of the system at the macroscopic level .",
    "however , at the microscopic level disorder is related to the nonlinearities and fluctuations responsible to chaotic behavior in the system and these chaotic motion phenomena can reflect in a nontrivial time dependence of the macroscopic quantities and , therefore , influencing all the dynamics of the system .",
    "this is clear once several properties of the system at longer times are closely related to the microscopic physics , like relaxation to equilibrium , phase ordering , thermalization and so on .",
    "thus we expect that chaos will be not only an important ingredient in determining the final states of a given system but also in how it gets there .",
    "previous studies on chaos in field theory have mostly emphasized chaotic behavior in gauge theory models ( for a review and additional references and applications , see @xcite ) . in special ,",
    "in homogeneous yang - mills - higgs models we can reduce the system of classical equations of motion to ones analogous to those of nonlinear coupled oscillators , which is well known to exhibit chaotic motion .    while in all the previous works on chaotic dynamics of fields dealt with ( conservative ) hamiltonian systems , here we will be mainly concerned with the _ effective _ field evolution equations , which are known to be intrinsically dissipative @xcite and ,",
    "therefore , the dynamical system we will be studying is non - hamiltonian .",
    "thus , we will be concerned with the influence of field dissipation , due to field decaying modes , on the degree of chaoticity of the field dynamics .",
    "typically we expect that dissipation damps the fluctuations on the system and consequently tends to suppress possible chaotic motions and makes field trajectories in phase space to tend faster to the system asymptotic states . on the other hand",
    "there are well known examples of dynamical systems , as the lorenz system @xcite , which are dissipative ones and at the same time they display a very rich evolution on phase space in which , under appropriate system parameters , field trajectories may be lead towards strange attractors .",
    "the verification of the same properties in a model motivated by particle physics would be a novel result with possible consequences to , for example , particle physics phenomenology and cosmology .",
    "we study chaos in our dynamical system of equations by means of the measure of the fractal dimension ( or dimension information ) [ for a review and definitions , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ] , which gives a topological measure of chaos for different space - time settings and it is a quantity invariant under coordinate transformations , providing then an unambiguous signal for chaos @xcite . the method we apply in this work for quantifying chaos will then be particularly useful in our planned future applications of our model and it extensions to a cosmological context , in which case other methods may be ambiguous , like , for example , the determination of lyapunov exponents , which does not give a coordinate invariant measure for chaos , as discussed in @xcite . also , other methods for studying chaotic systems , like for example by poincar sections , are not suitable in the case we are interested here , in which chaos is a transitory phenomenon as we will see .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the model and discuss its general properties at the classical level . in sec .",
    "iii we obtain the one - loop effective equations of motion for the fields and we determine the general form of the nonlocal ( non - markovian ) dissipative kernels . in sec .",
    "iv we then discuss the validity of the one - loop approximation and the markovian approximation for the dissipative kernels appearing in the one - loop effective equations .",
    "we couple our system of fields to a set of @xmath0 other fields making up the bath ( or environment ) , in which the system evolves , and the large n behavior of the various important quantities is determined . in sec .",
    "v we then present the markovian form for the effective equations of motion and our main numerical results , where we determine the fractal dimension . in sec .",
    "vi our concluding remarks are given .",
    "the model we will study consists of two scalar fields in interaction with lagrangian density given by    @xmath1 & = & \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 - \\frac{m_\\phi^2}{2 } \\phi^2 - \\frac{\\lambda_\\phi}{4 ! } \\phi^4 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\partial_\\mu \\psi)^2 - \\frac{m_\\psi^2}{2 } \\psi^2 - \\frac{\\lambda_\\psi}{4 ! } \\psi^4",

    "thus , for example , if we have an initial state prepared at @xmath8 , the @xmath4 field will move towards zero and remain around that state till eventually @xmath5 crosses below the critical value inducing a ( dynamical ) symmetry breaking in the @xmath4-field direction , after which the fields evolve to their vacuum values at @xmath9 .",

    "it seems also that we can indirectly associate the chaoticity in the system with the equilibration rates of the fields , in close analogy with the one found between the lyapunov exponent and the thermalization rate in perturbative thermal gauge theory @xcite .",
    "we note from the results obtained here and from the numerical simulations we performed , that the smaller is the fractal dimension ( or the larger is @xmath122 ) the fastest the fields equilibrate to their asymptotic states by loosing their energies to radiation , which will then eventually thermalize . a clear assessment to this interesting point , however , must be carefully studied from the complete nonlocal eoms , which then restores the time reversal invariance of the equations of motion .",
    "finally we would like to point out that the kind of model we have studied here and its generalization to larger number of fields is natural to be found in extensions of the standard model with large scalar sectors .",
    "physical implementations of the model can be found , for example , in particle physics or condensed matter models displaying multiple stages of phase transitions , in which case the dynamics we have studied here would be likely to manifest between any of that stages and , therefore , with consequences to the phenomenology of that models .",
    "the model studied here has also a strong motivation from inflationary models ( hybrid inflation ) @xcite . in special , in this context",
    ", a model lagrangian of a similar form of the one we studied here has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , showing the possibility of chaotic behavior during the final stages of inflation . however , the authors in @xcite make use of the classical equations of motion",
    ". it would be extremely interesting to assess the effect of quantum effects ( and particle productions ) and consequently dissipation also in that context , which is of fundamental relevance for the description of the process of reheating . in the particular study performed here",
    ", our results could apply instead to the description of the pre - inflationary stage , with possible contributions to the discussion of the fine - tuning problem of the initial field configuration in hybrid inflation @xcite .",
    "these problems are currently being examined by us and more results and details will be reported elsewhere .",
