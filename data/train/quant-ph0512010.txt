    "the generation of entanglement in an atomic ensemble of macroscopic dimensions is a challenging task in the fields of quantum information , quantum teleportation and precision measurements . out of the multitude of the entangled states that could conceivably be engineered using quantum optics techniques ,",
    "two subsets have attracted a special interest : spin squeezed states and `` schrodinger cat '' states .",
    "the first subset is needed for improving the precision of quantum measurements beyond the standard quantum limit , while the second one provides an example of a purely quantum mechanical superposition at the macroscopic level .",
    "the concept of spin squeezing has been introduced in a comprehensive manner in @xcite which also provide the first theoretical proposals for its realization .",
    "much attention has been given to the generation of atomic squeezing in the context of the interaction of cavity quantized fields with atoms , resulting in a transfer of squeezing to the atoms from a field initially in a squeezed state @xcite , or even from an initially coherent field state @xcite .",
    "free space squeezing transfer has also been predicted @xcite and analyzed experimentally @xcite .",
    "more recent proposals for the generation of entangled atomic states are based on the dispersive effect of off - resonant light - atom interactions .",
    "information about the atomic state is correlated with the phase shift accumulated by the field , and can be `` read '' by performing a suitable measurement of the field .",
    "the reverse effect of measuring a phase shift acquired by rydberg atoms in passing through a microcavity has already been used to generate a `` schrodinger cat '' state of a quantized field in a cavity @xcite .",
    "references @xcite provide other examples of phase - shift measurements that lead to a spin squeezed atomic state and entanglement between two macroscopic atomic ensembles .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that , with a suitably chosen internal atomic configuration and quantized fields , for the off - resonant regime , the interaction can be modelled in the form of a quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) hamiltonian proportional to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 represents the signal observable ( atomic population spin component ) while @xmath2 ( component of the stokes vector of the field ) is the probe observable to be measured . most often , a continuous measurement treatment of the problem is employed , where the polarization analysis of the probe light transmitted through the medium is detected in a `` balanced '' configuration with two photodetectors @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "sub - shot - noise fluctuations and spin squeezing with 70% reduction below the standard quantum limit have been achieved .",
    "the continuous character of the probe monitoring has also rendered possible an implementation of a feed - back loop for _ a posteriori _ quantum state correction based on the conditional measurement of the outcome @xcite .    in this paper",
    "a different approach is adopted to analyze the manner in which entanglement can be generated by means of field detection .",
    "in contrast to other theories , we consider the input field to be a classical field , rather than a ( quantized ) coherent state of the field . this is consistent with most experiments involving large scale entanglement , where the input field is a laser field , and quantum fluctuations of this field play a negligible role .",
    "the quantum properties of the output field are then related to the radiation scattered by atoms interacting with the input field .",
    "we apply this treatment to an atomic medium of 4-level faraday active atoms ( @xmath3 ) that can rotate the direction of polarization of an incoming field , given a population imbalance between the ground magnetic sublevels .",
    "one prepares the atomic ensemble in a superposition of ground state spin up and spin down with an equal admixture of both states . in this case , on average , there is no faraday effect .",
    "faraday rotation is induced solely by quantum fluctuations in the population difference of the spin up and spin down states . with an initially @xmath4",
    "polarized driving field , the faraday effect can be seen as due to a redistribution of photons between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 polarizations of the field . the @xmath5 polarized part is simply the source field emitted by the atoms and thus entangled with the atomic state ; in consequence , a measurement of this faraday rotated part of the field allows gathering of information on the atomic ensemble with a measurement strength proportional to the laser power ( as shown in @xcite ) .",
    "our approach also differs from other approaches in that we chose a different `` unravelling '' of the dynamics of the system .",
    "this is done by the choice of the measurement basis that we consider , which is given by an `` unbalanced '' detection setup with a polarization beam splitter used to separate the @xmath4 polarized light ( directed into an unmonitored port ) from the @xmath5 polarized part that is directed into a photodetector . owing to the pulsed regime considered here , the continuous character of the detection is also lost , leading to a formulation of the measurement as a `` discrete '' detection of the total photon number in the scattered pulse .",
    "conditioned on the outcome of such a measurement , one can guarantee that the atomic ensemble is in a spin squeezed state or a coherent superposition of squeezed states ( `` schrodinger cat '' state ) .",
    "only a single operation is necessary here to prepare a bimodal squeezed state ( `` schrodinger cat '' state ) , as opposed to the procedure of ref.@xcite which requires two qnd steps to prepare similar cat states .",
    "intuitively , the reduction from two steps to only one comes from the indistinguishability of the two possible rotations ( left - right ) of light corresponding to a given measured number of scattered photons .",
    "the main results of the paper are obtained in the ideal case where spontaneous decay to modes other than the optical mode of interest is neglected ; the unavoidable limitations imposed by decay are discussed in section iv and are consistent with the general conclusion @xcite that the resonant optical depth of the atomic ensemble sets the limit on the optimal achievable entanglement for the collective atomic state .",
    "however , we find the ideal case conclusions to be very useful in terms of providing a clear physical picture of entanglement generation .",
    "therefore , even if our measurement strength parameter @xmath6 is limited by spontaneous decay to values less than unity , we present results for large values of @xmath6 to illustrate the atom - field entanglement .",
    "it should be also noted that other limitations will come into play when a realistic evaluation of the proposed setup is made , such as non - idealof polarizers , and photodetection dark counts .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . the proposed experimental scheme and some fundamental notions about spin squeezing",
    "are introduced in section ii .",
    "section iii is devoted to the study of the faraday effect for a single atom and for many atoms .",
    "the single atom scattered field is shown to reflect atomic population fluctuations , while collective effects in the scattering process occur for the many atom case . in sec .",
    "iv the effective hamiltonian needed to describe the generation of the source field from atomic fluctuations is derived ; the spontaneous emission issue is also addressed here .",
    "also , the back - action on the atomic state of a measurement of @xmath7 photons in the field is derived using a quantum trajectories method .",

    "a population imbalance between the ground state sublevels induces a rotation of the overall polarization of the field ( faraday effect ) ; in other words , the emerging field ( after the interaction ) consists of an unscattered part ( whose intensity is equal to that of the incoming pulse since the depletion of the field due to absorption is neglected ) , an @xmath4 polarized scattered quantized field , and a @xmath5 polarized scattered quantized field .",

    "however , the scattered field intensity ( for both @xmath4 and @xmath5 polarized scattered fields ) is isotropic and reflects only the variation of the driving field envelope @xmath52 . we conclude that , when one measures the ratio of field amplitude @xmath53 to the driving field amplitude , the noise affecting its detection ( given by the ratio of @xmath54 to @xmath55 ) is always larger than the maximum signal .",
    "this problem can be overcome by making use of an ensemble of atoms where the signal scales as @xmath56 while the noise scales only as @xmath10 .",
    "a final observation that we make and which will be useful when the decoherence effects of the spontaneous decay will be taken into account is that the ground state coherence decays at a rate proportional to the driving field intensity .",
    "the parameter describing the total loss of coherence during the time the laser pulse is on is the time integrated one atom spontaneous emission rate : @xmath57      having observed that the polarization rotation can be explained as a single atom effect , we calculate the response of a collection of such faraday active atoms to an incident classical field . a pencil - shaped medium ( length @xmath13 ) with transverse area @xmath12 and density @xmath58 is considered . solving the bloch equations for the atomic polarizability induced by the external field and substituting this back into the maxwell equations , we obtain the induced amplitude and phase changes of the original field .",

    "notice that for a whole class of initial states exhibiting different population fluctuations but with the same vanishing expectation value of @xmath25 , a vanishing signal is obtained .",
    "this comes from ignoring the interaction with the vacuum field or , equivalently , by treating the scattered field as classical .",
    "when the vacuum modes are taken into account , a mixed semiclassical - quantized field approach can be used in which the atomic dipole is driven by a classical field and radiates a source field in the quantized vacuum . the source field components in the forward direction at position @xmath9 are obtained as ( see appendix b ) @xmath61 the @xmath5 part ( unlike the @xmath4 part ) shows a dependence on a collective spin operator of the ensemble .",
    "a faraday rotation operator can be defined as@xmath62 having variance @xmath63 the mean value of the rotation angle is , as expected , the same as predicted in the previous subsection .",
    "the usefulness of the new result is that atomic states that exhibit different fluctuations give rise to source fields with different quantum properties .",

    "spontaneous emission is neglected and the system follows a deterministic evolution described by an effective hamiltonian that is derived below .",
    "spontaneous emission can be introduced phenomenologically and will produce a degradation of the measurement - induced entanglement .      as seen in the previous section ,",
