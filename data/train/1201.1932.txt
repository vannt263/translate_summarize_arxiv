    "it is interesting to note that there is no need to arrange ions , i.e. , effective spins , on the ring to simulate the hamiltonian ( [ h_ising ] ) , see fig . [",

    "* preparation of the superposition state .",
    "* qpts can be studied either by diagonalizing the hamiltonian for a fixed set of coupling parameters or by adiabatically evolving the system from an easy - to - prepare ground state , which is especially relevant in cold atom experiments @xcite .",
    "we take the latter approach , as the former will always force the central spin to point in either @xmath13 or @xmath14 direction for any @xmath15 because @xmath16=0 $ ] .",
    "we assume that at @xmath17 the chain is prepared in a ground state and its coupling to the central spin is turned off , which provides freedom to engineer the state of the central spin .",
    "the composite wave function is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a ground state of @xmath20 and the central spin state is @xmath21 where @xmath22 . by changing both the bias field @xmath5 and the coupling @xmath23",

    "@xcite , @xmath26 can be simplified .",
    "considering adiabatic evolution , we obtain @xmath27 we thus study finite , i.e. , gapped , systems so that adiabatic evolution is possible by changing @xmath28 and @xmath29 slow enough . in the state ( [ psii ] ) , the chain experiences an average magnetic field @xmath30 with fluctuations @xmath31 in particular , this shows that once the desired coupling @xmath23 is adiabatically reached , fluctuations of the quantum potential are fixed .",
    "the state ( [ psii ] ) is already a schrdinger s cat state , where the two `` macroscopically '' distinct possibilities are the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases , both of which are coupled to the auxiliary two - level system .",
    "since we are interested in the qpt of the ising chain , we will `` trace out '' the central spin by measuring its state .",
    "if we will do the measurement in the @xmath32 basis , the superposition will be destroyed and the state of the ising chain will be one of the ground states @xmath33 .",
    "measurement in any other basis will result in a superposition of ising ground states at different magnetic fields .",
    "we assume that the measurement will be done in the eigenbasis of the @xmath34 operator : @xmath35 where we write @xmath36 as shorthand for @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the measurement of the central spin in the state @xmath38 leaves the chain in the state @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a ground state fidelity @xcite , or simply fidelity , whose crucial role in this problem will be carefully discussed below . without loss of generality",
    ", we define it in such a way that @xmath41 .",
    "now we comment on the measurement of the central spin",
    ". the state @xmath38 will occur with probability @xmath42 which depends on the relative phase between the ground states in the superposition ( [ psii ] ) . since the point of the measurement is to prepare a well - defined superposition state of the ising chain",
    ", we will describe properties of the ising chain after finding the central spin in , e.g. , the @xmath43 state .",
    "then , the ising chain will be in the state @xmath44 this state is the desired superposition of ferromagnetic and paramagnetic ground states when @xmath45 which is depicted in fig .",
    "we propose to call such a state a schrdinger magnet .",
    "the possibility to create such a novel state of matter is offered by the quantum magnetic field in eq .",
    "( [ ghat ] ) . indeed ,",
    "if there would be no quantum component in the magnetic field , the wave function of the ising chain after the adiabatic evolution would correspond to either a ferromagnetic or a paramagnetic phase ground state , but never to a superposition of both .",
    "* ising chain in the superposition state . * for simplicity , we assume that the measurements on the ising chain are performed immediately after measuring the central spin .",
    "the expectation value of an operator @xmath46 in the state ( [ phi_pm1 ] ) is @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the `` standard '' average , and @xmath50 designate the cross term that arises . for clarity of presentation , we restrict ourselves to real @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ meano1 ] ) , because @xmath51 is always real for the operators @xmath52 that we study .",
    "it is not real , however , for all operators ( e.g. , for @xmath53 ) , and it is a straightforward exercise to extend our calculations to these cases . while the standard average does not yield any new information , the cross term provides a non - trivial correction absent in a quantum phase transition in a classical field .    to further simplify the discussion , we average eq .",
    "( [ meano1 ] ) over several realizations where the appearance of the relative phase @xmath54 of the superposition ( [ psii ] ) is given by some probability distribution @xmath55 .",

    "we assume below for simplicity that @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "we denote the result of such averaging as @xmath59 , and define its variance through @xmath60 .",
    "finally , we introduce the notation @xmath61 because for the @xmath46 operators that we consider , @xmath62 is a well - defined non - zero quantity in the thermodynamic limit in which fidelity typically tends to zero ( see the discussion section ) .    the phase - averaged observable and its variance are @xmath63 with @xmath64 . by expanding @xmath65",
    "we see that the square root of variance is proportional to fidelity when @xmath66 .",

    "we have seen that the presence of the quantum external field allows for creation of the superposition state of two distinct ground states in general and two distinct phases in particular .",

    "the magnitude of this effect can be sizable as depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "a fundamentally important question can now be answered : what is the role of the system size in a quantum phase transition in a quantum field and what critical information is imprinted onto the cross terms .    to answer it",
    ", we note that all the cross terms that we studied are a product of the two terms : the ground state fidelity @xmath132 and a term that has a well - defined non - zero value in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "ground state fidelity , however , typically disappears in the thermodynamic limit of @xmath133 often invoked in the context of quantum phase transitions .",
    "this is known as anderson orthogonality catastrophe after the seminal work reported in ref .",
    "therefore , we are interested in the studies of systems for which @xmath3 ( to see quantum criticality ) , but still @xmath134 ( to avoid the catastrophe ) . there are three options here , which we will discuss below .",
    "instead of providing specific results for fidelity of the ising chain , we provide general scaling results to highlight the role of critical exponents in our problem and to keep the discussion concise .",
    "first , one can consider the limit of @xmath135 taken at fixed @xmath3 .",
    "then , fidelity reads @xcite @xmath136 near the critical point . here , @xmath137 is system dimensionality and @xmath138 is the critical exponent ( correlation length diverges as @xmath139 near the critical point ; @xmath140 in the ising chain that we consider ) .",
    "since fidelity is close to unity in this limit , the cross terms do not get small .",
    "one must remember , however , that they will be dominated by finite system size corrections requiring a separate study , which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "second , in the limit of @xmath133 at fixed @xmath23  the one that we assumed in our calculations ",
    "one can focus on the `` moderately '' large systems . to explain this term we note that near the critical point ( in the above - mentioned limit ) @xcite @xmath141 the crossover from eq .",
    "( [ def_sus ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ near_f ] ) happens near the critical point when @xcite @xmath142 we define the `` moderately '' large system to be just large enough to exhibit the scaling of fidelity with @xmath23 and @xmath73 given by eq .",
    "( [ near_f ] ) rather than eq .",
    "( [ def_sus ] ) . in the ising case ,",
    "( [ near_f ] ) predicts @xmath143 while eq .",
    "( [ def_sus ] ) predicts @xmath144 . for a `` moderately '' large system fidelity shall not be too small to erase the contribution of the cross term ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "third , one can study superpositions of two ground states from the same phase far away from the critical point . there",
    "@xmath145 , and for @xmath3 fidelity can be kept close to unity by a proper choice of @xmath23 .",
    "the downside of this scenario is that we loose the possibility to superimpose two phases .    from the above discussion",
    ", we see that the critical exponent @xmath138 is imprinted onto the cross term via fidelity .",
    "also the critical exponent @xmath146 is seen in the cross term @xmath147 contributing to spontaneous magnetization .",
    "the location of the critical point is most directly seen in the cross terms @xmath148 and @xmath149 through `` divergence '' of their second derivative over @xmath5 taken at @xmath150 .",
    "this is caused by the singularity of the second derivative of the ground state energy per spin across the critical point .",
    "this singularity will be rounded off in finite systems ( @xmath134 ) , but nevertheless there shall be pronounced peaks visible .",
    "we also note that while the `` standard '' averages @xmath151 and @xmath152 also encode the position of the critical point , they do not encode the critical exponent @xmath138 .    to observe the superposed phases",
    ", experiments will have to keep decoherence to a minimum . the decoherence rate of the state in eq .",
    "( [ phi_pm1 ] ) will depend on how well the environment distinguishes the two components , which will depend on the system size ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the overlap between the two states ( fidelity ) .",
    "thus , @xmath73 can not be too large and @xmath153 can not be too small .",
    "this is a similar issue to being able to observe the effect of the cross term , which we discussed above .",
    "we thus do not expect decoherence to be overwhelming in a properly prepared setup .",
    "further , the system size can be used as a parameter controlling decoherence , and its manipulation should be sufficient to bring decoherence down to an acceptable level .",
    "looking from a different perspective , studies of decoherence of such a novel macroscopic quantum superposition are fundamentally interesting on its own , e.g. , to boost understanding of the quantum - to - classical transition .    to conclude , we considered a quantum phase transition of an ising chain exposed to a quantum external field .",
    "this scenario can be used to create a new state of matter where the system is simultaneously in two distinct quantum phases .",
    "observables on the chain then take on forms that encode the ground state fidelity , the location of the critical point , and the universal critical exponents of the system .",
    "these findings set the foundations for developing a scaling theory of quantum phase transitions in quantum fields .",
    "recent advances in cold atom cavity - qed and ion traps may lead to experimental realization of superposed phases .",

    "we then directly calculate @xmath166 and @xmath167 ( both are positive ) .",
    "putting these results into eq .",
    "( [ meano1 ] ) , one can calculate the spontaneous magnetization in the @xmath94-direction in the superposition state ( [ phi_pm1 ] ) .",
    "the result is still dependent on the relative phase @xmath104 .",
    "when this phase is either @xmath168 or @xmath169 , spontaneous magnetization at any fixed @xmath5 , @xmath23 , and @xmath99 reaches an extremum .",
    "these extremal values are depicted by solid green lines in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "the next step is to use wick s theorem extended to such a cross - correlation @xcite .",
    "it can be used as long as the overlap @xmath173 is nonzero , which is the case in our calculations . then extending the results of ref .",
