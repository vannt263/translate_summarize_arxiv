    "may originate in a breakdown of einstein gravity at distances beyond the range above .",
    "dvali , gabadadze and porrati ( dgp ) @xcite have proposed a braneworld theory in which our universe is a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional brane embedded in an infinite minkowski bulk .",
    "gravity propagates everywhere , but , on the brane , an additional ( 3 + 1)-dimensional gravitational interaction is induced .",
    "this allows for gravitational potentials on the brane of a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional form at small distances to evolve into ( 4 + 1)-dimensional form beyond a crossover scale determined by the unknown energy scale for the bulk gravity .",
    "the cosmological solution of this theory was shown to exhibit accelerated cosmic expansion without the aid of an exotic energy component like dark energy @xcite@xcite .",
    "it has already been shown that the linearized field theory as defined by the dgp model contains ghost degrees of freedom @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , or even may violate causality in certain limits @xcite .",
    "it is known , for instance , that the de sitter background is unstable to classical linear perturbations ; however , it is claimed in @xcite that strong - coupling effects at small radii around matter sources ensure that the theory remains stable .",
    "the point of view of our work is to assume that linear perturbation theory remains valid on the largest scales .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that the late universe is dominated by the gravitational interaction of dark - matter haloes .",
    "the internal structure of the haloes is controlled by the strongly - coupled non - linear theory . on the other hand ,",
    "the radius below which strong - coupling is important for haloes is approximately equivalent to their size and therefore their interactions should be driven by the linear theory analyzed in this work .",
    "we do find that deep into the accelerated era the spacetime becomes unstable on the timescale of the expansion .",
    "however , this is an effect that only becomes important far into the future and is negligible as far as the observational impact today is concerned .",
    "we therefore assume that during the early universe , when the theory does not exhibit instabilities , the analysis for dgp proceeds in exactly the same way as that for gr",
    ". then , deep during the acceleration era , instabilities develop and the theory may or may not be saved by non - linear effects  an issue on which we remain agnostic .",
    "this evolutionary history appears to be the only one which is capable of reproducing the universe as we see it .",
    "if strong coupling effects are important straight away and at all scales , the approximation of a homogeneous background cosmology is completely inapplicable and the dgp model would not be able to reproduce observations such as supernova luminosities .",
    "we therefore effectively assume a best - case scenario for dgp : should this analysis fail to predict the observations , the model is excluded .",
    "if it passes the observational tests , a more careful study of the effects of the strong coupling regime during the acceleration era would be required to understand fully the future evolution of the universe in the dgp model .    under the above assumptions , the equations of motion for the theory of gravity on the brane , pertinent to the study of cosmology , do not close owing to the interaction with the bulk at first order in perturbation theory .",
