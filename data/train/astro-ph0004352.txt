    "the well - known mass discrepancies in galaxies ( bosma 1978 ; broeils 1992 ; verheijen 1997 ) and in clusters of galaxies ( zwicky 1937 ; carlberg , yee & ellingson 1997 ; tyson , kochanski & dellantonio 1998 ) are usually taken to imply the existence of a large fraction of invisible , or `` dark , '' matter ( dm ) in the universe .",
    "a popular candidate is cold dark matter , for which the dm particles , whatever they are , are almost at rest with respect to the hubble flow in the early universe .",
    "cdm is often imagined to be a heavy , non - baryonic relic particle from the early universe which has essentially only gravitational interactions with itself and with normal , or baryonic , matter .",
    "the cdm model has been studied intensively for twenty years and now has many well - worked out predictions for the formation of structure in the universe (   bertschinger 1998 ) .",
    "the broad - brush impression one now has is that the currently favored @xmath0cdm model boasts a considerable degree of success in predicting large - scale structure (  pearce  1999 ; bahcall  1999 ) .",
    "but it has become apparent in recent years that the predictions of almost any flavor of cdm are seriously at variance with the observed properties of galaxies because the central densities of collapsed objects and fragments are predicted to be too high (  [ sec : cusps ] ) .",
    "a number of authors have therefore begun to explore variations of the cdm model ; most favor a modification to the properties of the dm particles rather than the alternative  a change to the law of gravity .",
    "the simplest is the warm dm matter model (  colombi , dodelson & widrow 1996 ; sommer - larsen & dolgov 1999 ; hogan 1999 ) in which streaming of the dm particles in the early universe suppresses small - scale power in the fluctuation spectrum .",
    "in addition , wdm particles in halos of greater volume density must have larger velocity spreads , because of liouville s theorem , thereby precluding strong density gradients .",
    "simulators of the wdm model suppress small - scale power in the fluctuation spectrum but generally ignore the initial finite velocity spread , which is difficult to include without wrecking the quiet start .",
    "since the dm in these simulations still has infinite phase space density , the resulting halo profiles have density cusps resembling those which form in cdm (  moore  1999 ; coln  2000 ) .",
    "if the dm particle decoupled from thermal equilibrium at some early epoch , then its phase space density today can be predicted .",
    "fermionic dm would have a finite initial maximum @xmath1 , which leads the well - known constraint on neutrino masses ( tremaine & gunn 1979 ) .",
    "hogan ( 1999 ) suggests that halos today may reflect , @xmath2 , the average over the initial velocity distribution .",
    "but @xmath3 is unbounded for bosons , making a single value of @xmath2 rather poorly defined ( madsen 2000 ) .",
    "thus phase space density constraints are much weaker for bosonic wdm ; careful simulations are needed to predict the structure of halos in this model , but the small fraction of high @xmath4 material makes mild cusps seem likely .    the fine - grained phase space density , @xmath5 , of a truly collisionless fluid is strictly conserved , but the maximum coarse - grain density , @xmath6 , can decrease during violent evolution , such as a collapse or merger .",
    "simulations , which by their nature can track only @xmath6 , have found , however , that the maximum @xmath6 _ barely changes _ in even quite violent collapses ( may & van albada 1984 ) or mergers ( farouki , shapiro & duncan 1983 ; barnes 1992 ) .",
    "these tests were with systems that have finite @xmath3 at the outset , whereas @xmath6 can , and generally does , decrease during the collapse or merger of systems with unbounded @xmath3 .",
    "hernquist , spergel & heyl ( 1993 ) merged systems with cusped density profiles having unbounded @xmath3 ; they defined an `` average '' phase space density over the inner half of the mass distribution @xmath7 , which decreased during major mergers .",
    "dalcanton & hogan ( 2000 ) construct a heuristic argument that @xmath6 should decrease during mergers , but like hernquist , their argument applies to the average value over the inner part of the halo , which probably does decrease , rather than the specific central value which , if originally finite , remains almost unchanged .",
    "processes such as baryonic cooling and smooth infall , or even feedback from star formation , do not change @xmath4 for the dm .",
    "scattering of halo particles by dense clumps of baryonic matter could change @xmath4 locally , but simulations with a baryonic component (  navarro & steinmetz 2000 ) do not appear to lead to significantly different halo profiles from those in which baryonic processes are omitted .",
    "dynamical friction in barred galaxies also hardly affects the structure of the inner halo , even when it is intolerably fierce ( debattista & sellwood 2000 ) .",
    "thus @xmath3 for halos today should all cluster around a common value if the dm particle is a collisionless fermion having some fixed velocity spread in the early universe .",
    "fermionic wdm halos should today approximate cored isothermal spheres having finite central densities .",
    "the 1-d velocity dispersion in an isotropic , isothermal sphere is simply @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the flat circular speed from the halo ( binney & tremaine 1987  4.4b ) . a finite central density , @xmath10 , yields a rotation curve with a central slope @xmath11 . for the popular halo fitting function @xmath12 , the asymptotic velocity , core radius and central density are related as @xmath13 .",
    "other functional forms (  evans 1993 ) , departures from sphericity , or from velocity isotropy merely introduce correction factors of order unity",
    ". thus measurements of @xmath14 and of either @xmath10 or @xmath15 for the halo allow us to estimate @xmath16 .",
    "rotation curves of galaxies include contributions from components other than dm , of course .",
    "hi data that extend well outside the optical part of the galaxy provide reasonably firm values for @xmath14 .",
    "rotation curves that are well - resolved in the inner parts provide an upper limit to @xmath10 , which may be close to the actual value if the baryonic contribution is small , as in low surface brightness systems ( lsbs ) . in many cases , however , either @xmath9 or @xmath10 for the dm halo depends on the decomposition of the rotation curve into the separate contributions from luminous and dark matter , which is generally controversial .",
    "i assume maximum disk models , and discuss below how this assumption affects the values .",
    "figure [ fig : psd ] shows estimates of @xmath16 in a number of well - observed galaxies .",
    "the data and their sources are summarized in table [ tab : data ] with the exception of the points for the draco and ursa minor dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "broeils ( 1992 ) gives large formal values of @xmath17 for three galaxies ( noted in table [ tab : data ] ) ; in these cases , i conservatively determine @xmath18 from @xmath19 instead of @xmath14 .",
    "the pluses in figure [ fig : psd ] are for the draco and ursa minor dwarf spheroidal galaxies , which both have a stellar velocity dispersion @xmath20 km s@xmath21 ( armandroff , olszewski & pryor 1995 ) .",
    "the uppermost point assumes a simple mass - follows - light king model ( binney & tremaine 1987 ,  4.4 ) with an estimated king radius for draco of 150  pc ( pryor & kormendy 1990 ) that yields a central density of 0.7  m@xmath22 pc@xmath23 ( pryor , private communication ) . the dm halo could have a larger @xmath15 and @xmath18 than the stars , however , implying a lower @xmath3 .",
    "we place an extreme lower bound on @xmath3 , which is essentially the same for both draco and umin .",
    ", as follows : we adopt the lower bound @xmath24",
    "m@xmath22 pc@xmath23 ( olszewski 1998 ) , and the argument ( gerhard & spergel 1992 ) that their masses must be @xmath25 m@xmath22 .",
    "treating this gigantic , low - density halo as a @xmath26 king model , we obtain @xmath27 km s@xmath21",
    ". slightly more extreme models could be imagined , but m / l@xmath28 for this model already ! a more resonable lower bound might be to adopt m / l@xmath29 , on the high side for galaxy clusters (   carlberg  1997 ; tyson  1998 ) , which would require @xmath30 km s@xmath21 .",
    "the values of @xmath3 for this , and the above more extreme , model are shown by the lower pluses in figure [ fig : psd ] .",
    "while maximum disk models are not universally accepted , most of the points in figure [ fig : psd ] would not move much if this assumption were dropped .",
    "three of the lsbs from swaters , madore & trewhella ( 2000 ) are plotted ( squares ) for both their `` maximum disk '' and `` no disk '' fits for which @xmath3 differs by at most factor 100 .",
    "the dm halo for a `` no disk '' fit to ngc 3198 , the proto - typical galaxy for dm studies , has the same @xmath14 but a core some 5 - 6 times smaller ( van albada  1985 ) , increasing @xmath3 by the square of this factor .",
    "while these are substantial uncertainties , they are small in relation to the total range .",
    "there are three possible conclusions from this figure .",
    "first , the range of @xmath3 could be mostly due to errors .",
    "clearly some invidual points could be in error by a couple of orders of magnitude , but others are more certain .",
    "the spread is admittedly greatly increased by the highest point for the dwarf spheroidals , which is not well determined because we observe only the stars at the centers of the halos .",
    "this point can be brought into the main cluster in the figure , but only by adopting a truly extreme model .",
    "similarly , the lower points could be moved up by adopting sub - maximal disk models .",
    "if one wishes to argue that the _ entire _ spread is due to measurement errors , and that the dm halos manifest a characteristic value for @xmath3 , that value corresponds to a thermal relic fermion with a mass of @xmath31ev ,  hot dm ( hdm ) , which has been rejected previously (  gerhard & spergel 1992 ; cen & ostriker 1992 ) .    dalcanton & hogan ( 2000 ) , who present a similar diagram , argue that the measurements are not of @xmath3 but of some average value over the inner halo . if the density profiles of all halos rise to a finite central value with a similar functional form , however , their quantity would also have a characteristic value in wdm . to be consistent with wdm , they require the halo density to continue to rise steeply inside @xmath15 , with high @xmath4 material at the very center contributing little to the average over the volume inside @xmath15 .",
    "their interpretation therefore therefore applies to a dm particle that has initially unbounded @xmath3 .",
    "if the values in figure 1 are indeed measurements of @xmath3 , most of the seven orders of magnitude spread is enormously larger than could be allowed if the wdm particle were a collisionless fermion .",
    "phase space density constraints can not be applied to cdm , or strictly to bosonic wdm despite its velocity dispersion , since @xmath3 is unbounded .",
    "it is the absence of an upper bound to the phase space density in cdm which gives rise to density cusps in the collapsed halos ( moore  1998 ; klypin  2000 ) .",
    "( this is also true of the cold component of the less - appealing mixed dm models [  kofman  1996 ] . )",
    "an unbounded @xmath3 is the root cause of the difficulties now besetting cdm :    \\(1 ) the `` concentration index '' of the halo , which has a range of values ( bullock  1999 ) , implies a high central dm density , that should increase still further as the baryons cool and settle to the center .",
    "low luminosity galaxies and lsbs are believed to have the largest fractions of dm , and therefore halos for which compression by baryonic infall is least important .",
    "yet the rotation curves of these galaxies ( ct  1997 ; swaters   2000 ) rise gently , suggesting a low density core , irrespective of the m / l ascribed to the baryonic component",
    ". the halo profiles in bright hsb galaxies are more model - dependent , since the rotation curves in these galaxies generally do rise quickly ( rubin , kenney & young 1997 ; sofue  1999 ) .",
    "it is now clear , however , that the inner part of the rotation curves of these galaxies is dominated by the luminous disk and bulge ; even in these cases , the dm halo has a large , low - density core ( debattista & sellwood 1998 ) or very low concentration index ( weiner  2000 ) .",
    "thus , there is little support for high central densities of dm within the halos of any type of galaxy .",
    "\\(2 ) the merging hierarchy causes the cooled baryonic fraction to lose angular momentum to the halo , making disks that are too small ( navarro & white 1994 ; navarro & steinmetz 1997 ) . the predicted angular momentum of the disk is an order of magnitude less than that observed .",
    "the problem is only partially ameliorated ( maclow & ferrara 1999 ; navarro & steinmetz 2000 ) if some process ( usually described as `` feedback from star formation '' ) prevents most of the gas from cooling until after the galaxy is assembled .",
    "\\(3 ) navarro & steinmetz ( 2000 ) describe their failure to predict the zero - point of the tully - fisher relation as a `` fatal problem for the @xmath0cdm paradigm . ''",
    "they show that no matter what m / l is assumed for the disk , the predicted circular speed at a given luminosity is too high because the halo density is too high",
    ". the tully - fisher prediction may be even worse , since cdm predicts @xmath32 ( dalcanton , spergel & summers 1997 ; mo , mao & white 1998 ) , whereas verheijen ( 1997 ) stresses that when @xmath33 is interpreted as the circular velocity of the flat part of the rotation curve , the true relation is closer to @xmath34 .",
    "\\(4 ) the results from high - resolution @xmath35-body simulations ( klypin  1999 ; moore  1999 ) have revealed large numbers of sub - clumps within large dm halos , many more than are observed as satellite galaxies . whether these fragments threaten the survival of thin disks in the host galaxy , remains to be seen .",
    "( wdm models are largely motivated to avoid this problem by suppressing small - scale power in the initial perturbation spectrum . )",
    "these difficulties may not yet be fatal to cdm , since a better understanding of baryonic processes in galaxy formation could conceivably alter the predictions .",
    "it is unclear what process could loosen the high density clumps of dm , however ;  debattista & sellwood ( 2000 ) show that an intolerable degree of dynamical friction has a very mild effect on the halo density profile .",
    "the first of these problems , which is shared by all dm models that predict cusped halos , is key .",
    "the highest quality data (  blais - ouellette   1999 ) do appear to show that the halo density profile rises gently to a finite central value . this result is controversial , however , since others (  van den bosch  1999 ) argue that the observed rotation curves could be consistent with mild density cusps in the halos .",
    "more high - quality data should eventually settle the issue .",
    "fermionic wdm halos should have well - defined cores with a characteristic @xmath3 .",
    "this prediction is inconsistent with the range of values shown in figure 1 which rules out this particular dm candidate .",
    "halos having finite central densities are also inconsistent with the density cusps predicted by cdm , and possibly also bosonic wdm .",
    "other work has excluded hdm .",
    "thus the existence of finite central density cores in halos would rule out most forms of simple , collisionless relic particle as dm candidates .",
    "it is therefore of great importance to obtain tighter observational constraints on the inner density profiles of halos .",
    "it is suddenly popular to hypothesize extra properties for the cdm particle in order to soften the collapsed halos ( spergel & steinhardt 1999 ; peebles 2000 ; goodman 2000 ; hu  2000 ; kaplinghat  2000 ; ) .",
    "the simple cdm model would become much less attractive if an extra _ ad hoc _ property were needed to rescue it .",
    "the nature of dm is increasingly constrained by the observed properties of galaxy halos . in particular , any successful theory of galaxy formation will need to account for the wide range of phase space densities for dm shown in figure 1 .",
