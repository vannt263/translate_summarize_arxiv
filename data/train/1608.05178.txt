    "quandles were introduced independently by matveev @xcite and joyce @xcite , where matveev referred them as distributive groupoids . to each oriented diagram @xmath9 of a tame knot @xmath10 in @xmath11 , they associated a quandle called the knot quandle @xmath12 , which is presented by generators corresponding to the connected components of @xmath9 and relations @xmath13 whenever the arc @xmath14 passes over the double point separating arcs @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "= 3.5 cm = 3.5 cm    from the defining axioms of a quandle ( see section [ section2 ] ) it follows that @xmath17 does not depend on the diagram @xmath9 and is an invariant of @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , matveev and joyce proved that it is a complete invariant up to weak equivalence .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath10 and @xmath18 are two knots with @xmath19 , then @xmath20 is homeomorphic to @xmath21 when we ignore orientations of @xmath11 and the knots . over the years , quandles and their analogues have been investigated to construct more computable invariants for knots and links .",
    "see for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "although knot quandles are strong invariants of knots , it is usually difficult to distinguish two quandles from their presentations just like knot groups .",
    "however , a comparison of homomorphisms from two quandles to simpler quandles can provide useful information . for example , fox s @xmath22-colourings are representations of the knot quandle into the dihedral quandle of order @xmath22 @xcite . in this paper , we attempt to make a unified investigation of automorphism groups and connectivity of quandles arising from groups . at this point ,",
    "our approach is purely algebraic and we make no reference to knots .",
    "however , it would be interesting to explore implications of these results in knot theory .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ section2 ]",
    ", we recall the definition of a quandle and give important examples . in section [ section3 ]",
    ", we consider the problem of embedding of quandles into conjugation quandles of groups . in section [ section4 ]",
    ", we determine the group of automorphisms and inner automorphisms of takasaki quandles of abelian groups with no 2-torsion ( theorem [ main - theorem ] ) .",
    "we also determine a subgroup of the automorphism group of conjugation quandle of a group @xmath0 . in section [ section5 ] ,",
    "we investigate commutativity and connectivity of generalised alexander quandles .",
    "in particular , we prove that if the generalised alexander quandle of a group with respect to an involutory central automorphism is connected , then the group is necessarily abelian .",
    "finally , in section [ section6 ] , we determine the group of automorphisms and inner automorphisms of alexander quandles of finite abelian groups with respect to fixed - point free automorphisms ( theorem [ fixed - point - free - theorem ] ) . as an application , in theorem [ fnt - generalisation ] , we prove that if @xmath5 and @xmath6 is multiplication by a non - trivial unit of @xmath7 , then @xmath8 acts doubly transitively on @xmath3 .",
    "this generalises a recent result of ferman , nowik and teicher @xcite for quandles of prime order .",
    "a _ quandle _ is a set @xmath23 with a binary operation @xmath24 satisfying the following conditions :    1 .",
    "@xmath25 for all @xmath26 ; 2 .   for any @xmath27",
    "there is a unique @xmath28 such that @xmath29 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath30 for all @xmath31 .",
    "besides knot quandles associated to knots , many interesting examples of quandles comes from groups . throughout the paper",
    ", we write arbitrary groups multiplicatively and abelian groups additively .    1 .",
    "if @xmath0 is a group and @xmath32 an integer , then the set @xmath0 equipped with the binary operation @xmath33 gives a quandle structure on @xmath0 . for @xmath34 , it is called the _ conjugation quandle _ , and is denoted by @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath36 is an additive abelian group , then the set @xmath36 equipped with the binary operation @xmath37 gives a quandle structure on @xmath36 , denoted by @xmath38 .",
    "such quandles ( earlier called _ keis _ ) were first studied by takasaki @xcite . for @xmath39 , it is called the _ dihedral quandle _ , and is denoted by @xmath40 .",
    "3 .   let @xmath36 be an additive abelian group and @xmath41 .",
    "then the set @xmath36 equipped with the binary operation @xmath42 is a quandle called the _ alexander quandle _ of @xmath36 with respect to @xmath43 .",
    "next we consider quandles which are of utmost importance for this paper , and appeared first in the work of joyce @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a group and @xmath1 , then the set @xmath0 with binary operation @xmath2 gives a quandle structure on @xmath0 , which we denote by @xmath3 .",
    "these quandles are referred in the literature ( for example @xcite ) as generalized alexander quandles .",
    "note that , if @xmath36 is an additive abelian group and @xmath44 , then @xmath45 .",
    "thus we have @xmath46 , the takasaki quandle of @xmath36 . on the other hand , for arbitrary @xmath6",
    ", we have @xmath47 .",

    "it is evident that @xmath52 is a normal subgroup of @xmath53 .",
    "a quandle @xmath23 is called _ involutory _ if @xmath54 for all @xmath49 .",

    "an automorphism @xmath6 of a group @xmath0 is called _ fixed - point free _ if @xmath59 implies that @xmath60 .",

    "now for each @xmath70 , we have @xmath71 hence @xmath72 is a quandle homomorphism .",
    "further , @xmath73 together with the hypothesis that @xmath6 is fixed - point free implies that @xmath74 .",
    "hence @xmath72 is an embedding of @xmath23 in @xmath75 .",
