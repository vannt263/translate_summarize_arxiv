    "the original c - metric has been found by levi - civita in his studies between 1917 and 1919 . during the following decades ,",
    "many authors have rediscovered it and studied its mathematical properties ( see @xcite for references ) . in 1963 ehlers and kundt @xcite have classified degenerated static vacuum fields and put this levi - civita solution into the c slot of the table they constructed . from then onwards this solution has been called c - metric .",
    "this spacetime is stationary , axially symmetric , petrov type d , and is an exact solution which includes a radiative term .",
    "although the c - metric had been studied from a mathematical point of view along the years , its physical interpretation remained unknown until 1970 when kinnersley and walker @xcite , in a pathbreaking work , have shown that the solution describes two uniformly accelerated black holes in opposite directions .",
    "indeed , they noticed that the original solution was geodesically incomplete , and by defining new suitable coordinates they have analytically extended it and studied its causal structure .",
    "the solution has a conical singularity in one of its angular poles that was interpreted by them as due to the presence of a strut in between pushing the black holes away , or as two strings from infinity pulling in each one of the black holes .",
    "the strut or the strings lie along the symmetry axis and cause the acceleration of the black hole pair .",
    "this work also included for the first time the charged version of the c - metric . in an important development , ernst in 1976 @xcite , trough the employment of an appropriate transformation , has removed all the conical singularities of the charged c - metric by appending an external electromagnetic field . in this new exact ernst solution the acceleration of the pair of oppositely charged black holes is provided by the lorentz force associated to the external field .",
    "the geometrical properties of the c - metric were further investigated by farhoosh and zimmerman @xcite , and the asymptotic properties of the c - metric were analyzed by ashtekar and dray @xcite who have shown that null infinity admits a conformal completion , has a spherical section , and moreover that the causal diagrams drawn in @xcite were not quite accurate .",
    "the issue of physical interpretation of the c - metric has been recovered by bonnor @xcite , but now following a different approach .",
    "he transformed the c - metric into the weyl form in which the solution represents a finite line source ( that corresponds to the horizon of the black hole ) , a semi - infinite line mass ( corresponding to a horizon associated with uniform accelerated motion ) and a strut keeping the line sources apart . by applying a further transformation that enlarges this solution , bonnor confirmed the physical interpretation given in @xcite .",
    "bonnor s procedure has been simplified by cornish and uttley and extended to include the massive charged solution @xcite .",
    "more recently , yongcheng @xcite , starting from the metric of two superposed schwarzschild black holes , has derived the c - metric under appropriate conditions .",
    "the black hole uniqueness theorem for the c - metric has been proven by wells @xcite and the geodesic structure of the c - metric has been studied by pravda and pravdova @xcite .",
    "the limit when the acceleration goes to infinity has been analyzed by podolsk ' y and griffiths @xcite who have shown that in this limit the solution is analogous to the one which describes a spherical impulsive gravitational wave generated by a snapping string .",
    "we note that the c - metric is an important and explicit example of a general class of asymptotically flat radiative spacetimes with boost - rotation symmetry and with hypersurface orthogonal axial and boost killing vectors .",
    "the geometric properties of this general class of spacetimes have been investigated by bi ' ak and schmidt @xcite and the radiative features were analyzed by bi ' ak @xcite ( see the recent review of pravda and pravdova @xcite on this class of spacetimes and the role of the c - metric ) .",
    "relevant generalizations to the c - metric were made by plebaski and demiaski in 1976 @xcite and by dowker , gauntlett , kastor and traschen in 1994 @xcite .",
    "plebaski and demiaski , in addition to the mass ( @xmath4 ) and electromagnetic charge ( @xmath5 ) , have included into the solution a nut parameter , a rotation and a cosmological constant term ( @xmath6 ) , and dowker et al have further included a dilaton field non - minimally coupled .",
    "thus , the most general c - metric has eight parameters , so far , namely , acceleration , mass , electric and magnetic charges , nut parameter , rotation , cosmological constant and dilaton field .",
    "the c - metric with mass and electromagnetic charges alone have been extensively studied as shown above , and from now on we will refer to it as the flat c - metric ( i.e. , c - metric with @xmath7 ) .",
    "the c - metric with a nut parameter has not been studied , as far as we know .",
    "the flat spinning c - metric has been studied by farhoosh and zimmerman @xcite , letelier and oliveira @xcite and by bi ' ak and pravda @xcite . in particular , in @xcite the flat spinning c -",
    "metric has been transformed into the weyl form and interpreted as two uniformly accelerated spinning black holes connected by a strut .",
    "this solution constitutes an example of a spacetime with an axial and boost killing vectors which are not hypersurface orthogonal .",
    "dowker et al generalized the flat c - metric and flat ernst solution to include a dilaton field and applied these solutions for the first time in the context of quantum pair creation of black holes , that once created accelerate apart .    in what concerns the cosmological c - metric introduced in @xcite ,",
    "the de sitter ( ds ) case ( @xmath8 ) has been analyzed by podolsk ' y and griffiths @xcite , whereas the anti - de sitter ( ads ) case ( @xmath9 ) has been studied , in special instances , by emparan , horowitz and myers @xcite and by podolsk ' y @xcite . in general",
    "the c - metric ( either flat , ds or ads ) describes a pair of accelerated black holes .",
    "indeed , in the flat and ds backgrounds this is always the case .",
    "however , in an ads background the situation is not so simple and depends on the relation between the acceleration @xmath10 of the black holes and the cosmological length @xmath1 .",
    "since the ads c - metric presents such peculiar features it deserves a careful analysis .",
    "it is our intention in this paper to fully study , in its most general form , the ads c - metric with mass , charge and cosmological constant . one can divide the study into three cases , namely , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath11 case was the one analyzed by podolsk ' y @xcite , and the @xmath14 case has been investigated by emparan , horowitz and myers @xcite , which has acquired an important role since the authors have shown that , in the context of a lower dimensional randall - sundrum model , it describes the final state of gravitational collapse on the brane - world .",
    "the geodesic structure of this solution has been studied by chamblin @xcite .",
    "both cases , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , represent one single accelerated black hole .",
    "the case @xmath17 has not been fully studied and its physical interpretation is not yet firmly established , although it has been applied , in addition to the flat and ds cases , in pair creation of black holes by hawking , horowitz and ross @xcite , and by mann @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the purpose of this article is to establish that the @xmath17 ads c - metric describes a pair of accelerated black holes in an ads background .",
    "this aim will be achieved through a thorough analysis of the causal structure of the solution , together with the description of the solution in the ads 4-hyperboloid , and the study of the strut s physics .",
    "the plan of this article is as follows . in section [ sec : int ]",
    "we present the ads c - metric and analyze its curvature and conical singularities . in section [ sec : pd ]",
    "we study the causal diagrams of the solution . in section [ sec : phys_interp ] we give and justify a physical interpretation to the solution .",
    "the description of the solution in the ads 4-hyperboloid and the physics of the strut are analyzed .",
    "these two sections , [ sec : pd ] and [ sec : phys_interp ] , are highly related and so , in order to fully understand each of them , the reading of the other is required .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conc ] concluding remarks are presented .",
    "the ads c - metric , i.e. , the c - metric with negative cosmological constant @xmath6 , has been obtained by plebaski and demiaski @xcite . for zero rotation and zero nut parameter it is given , according to @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , by @xmath18 where @xmath19 the meaning of parameters @xmath20 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 will be clarified soon . for the benefit of comparison with the flat c - metric , we note that when @xmath6 vanishes we have @xmath21 .",
    "it is now convenient to redefine the parameter @xmath20 as @xmath22 , together with the coordinate transformations : @xmath23 and @xmath24 . with these redefinitions , the gravitational field of the ads",
    "c - metric is written as @xmath25^{-2 } ( -{\\cal f}dt^2 +   { \\cal f}^{-1}dy^2+{\\cal g}^{-1}dx^2",

    "we will consider the case @xmath33 .",
    "the coordinates used in eqs .",
    "( [ c - metric])-([potential ] ) to describe the ads c - metric are useful to understand the geometrical properties of the spacetime , but they hide the physical interpretation of the solution . in order to understand the physical properties of the source and gravitational field we will introduce progressively new coordinates more suitable to this propose , following the approach of kinnersley and walker @xcite and ashtekar and dray @xcite .",
    "although the alternative approach of bonnor simplifies in a way the interpretation , we can not use it were since the cosmological constant prevents such a coordinate transformation into the weyl form .",
    "we start by defining a coordinate @xmath34 as @xmath35^{-1 } \\ : .",
    "\\label{r}\\ ] ] in order to interpret this coordinate as being a radial coordinate , we calculate a curvature invariant of the metric , namely the kretschmann scalar , @xmath36 }            \\ : .",

    "when at least one of these parameters is not zero , the curvature invariant diverges at @xmath38 , revealing the presence of a curvature singularity .",
    "moreover , when we take the limit @xmath39 , the curvature singularity approaches the expected value for a spacetime which is asymptotically ads .",
    "therefore it is justified that @xmath34 is interpreted as a radial coordinate .      to gain more insight into the physical nature of the ads c - metric we now turn our attention into the angular surfaces @xmath40constant and @xmath41constant , onwards labelled by @xmath42 . in this section",
    "we follow @xcite . in order to have the ads c - metric with correct signature , @xmath43",
    ", one must restrict the coordinate @xmath44 to a domain on which the function @xmath45 is non - negative [ see eq .",
    "( [ c - metric ] ) ] .",
    "the shape of this function depends crucially on the three parameters @xmath10 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 . in this work",
    "we will select only the ranges of these three parameters for which @xmath45 has at least two real roots , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( say ) , and demand @xmath44 to belong to the range @xmath48 $ ] where @xmath49 .",
    "this restriction has the important advantage of allowing us to endow the angular surfaces @xmath42 with the topology of a compact surface . in these surfaces",
    "we now define two new coordinates , @xmath50 where @xmath51 ranges between @xmath52 $ ] and @xmath53 is an arbitrary positive constant which will be needed later when regularity conditions at the poles are discussed .",
    "the coordinate @xmath54 ranges between the north pole , @xmath55 , and the south pole , @xmath56 ( not necessarily at @xmath57 ) . with these transformations",
    "the metric restricted to the surfaces @xmath42 , @xmath58 , takes the form @xmath59 when @xmath60 or when both @xmath61 and @xmath62 , eq .",
    "( [ ang ] ) gives @xmath63 , @xmath64 and if we use the freedom to put @xmath65 , the metric restricted to @xmath42 is given by @xmath66 .",
    "this implies that in this case the angular surface is a sphere and justifies the label given to the new angular coordinates defined in eq .",
    "( [ ang ] ) . in this case",
    "the north pole is at @xmath67 or @xmath68 and the south pole is at @xmath69 or @xmath70 . in the other cases @xmath44 and @xmath71 can always be expressed as elliptic functions of @xmath54 .",
    "the explicit form of these functions is of no need in this work .",
    "all we need to know is that these functions have a period given by @xmath72 .",
    "as we shall see , the regularity analysis of the metric in the region @xmath73 $ ] will play an essential role in the physical interpretation of the ads c - metric .",
    "the function @xmath74 is positive and bounded in @xmath750,\\theta_\\mathrm{s}[$ ] and thus , the metric is regular in this region between the poles",
    ". we must be more careful with the regularity analysis at the poles , i.e. , at the roots of @xmath76 .",
    "indeed , if we draw a small circle around the north pole , in general , as the radius goes to zero , the limit circunference / radius is not @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , in order to avoid a conical singularity at the north pole one must require that @xmath78 , where @xmath79 repeating the procedure , this time for the south pole , @xmath46 , we conclude that the conical singularity at this pole can also be avoid if @xmath80 the so far arbitrary parameter @xmath53 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ ang ] ) plays its important role here .",
    "indeed , if we choose @xmath81 eq . ( [ def - s ] ) is satisfied .",
    "however , since we only have a single constant @xmath53 at our disposal and this has been fixed to remove the conical singularity at the south pole , we conclude that the conical singularity will be present at the north pole .",
    "there is another alternative .",
    "we can choose instead @xmath82 ( where @xmath83 means derivative in order to @xmath44 ) and by doing so we avoid the deficit angle at the north pole and leave a conical singularity at the south pole . in section [ sec : phys_interp ] we will see that in the extended kruskal solution the north pole points towards the other black hole , while the south pole points towards infinity .",
    "the first choice of @xmath53 corresponds to a strut between the black holes while the alternative choice corresponds to two strings from infinity into each black hole .",
    "we leave the discussion on the physical nature of the conical singularities and on the two possible choices for the value of @xmath53 to section [ sec : pi - strut ] .",
    "there is a small number of very special cases for which the very particular condition , @xmath84 is verified . in these special cases ,",
    "the solution is free of conical singularities .",
    "they will be mentioned bellow .    since we have managed to put @xmath85 in a form equal to @xcite , we can now , following @xcite closely , describe the behavior of @xmath85 for different values of the parameters @xmath10 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "we can divide this discussion in three cases .    _",
    "1 . massless uncharged solution _",

    "_ 2 . massive uncharged solution _",

    "when @xmath91 , @xmath85 has three roots and , as justified above , we require @xmath44 to lie between the two roots for which @xmath93 . in doing",
    "so we maintain the metric with the correct signature and have an angular surface @xmath42 which is compact .",

    "when @xmath94 , @xmath42 is an open angular surface .",
    "for this reason , onwards we will analyze only the case @xmath91 .",
    "_ 3 . massive charged solution _ ( @xmath90 , @xmath95 ) : for a general massive charged solution , depending on the values of the parameters @xmath10 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath85 can be positive in a single compact interval , @xmath75x_\\mathrm{s},x_\\mathrm{n}[$ ] , or in two distinct compact intervals , @xmath75x'_\\mathrm{s},x'_\\mathrm{n}[$ ] and @xmath75x_\\mathrm{s},x_\\mathrm{n}[$ ] , say . in this latter case we will work only with the interval @xmath48 $ ] ( say ) for which the charged solutions reduce to the uncharged solutions when @xmath62 .",
    "these solutions have a conical singularity at one of the poles .",
    "the only massive charged solutions that are totally free of conical singularities are those which satisfy the particular conditions @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",

    ", @xmath85 is an even function , has two symmetric roots and is positive between them .",
    "the angular surface @xmath42 is therefore compact and there are no conical singularities at both poles . once again , this suggests that the solution is written in an accelerated coordinate frame .      in this section",

    "indeed , @xmath109 corresponds to @xmath110 , and @xmath111 to @xmath38 .",
    "note however , that when both @xmath4 and @xmath5 vanish there are no restrictions on the ranges of @xmath34 and @xmath107 ( i.e. , @xmath112 and @xmath113 ) since in this case there is no curvature singularity at the origin of @xmath34 to justify the constraint on the coordinates .",
    "in this section we analyze the causal structure of the solution . as occurs with the original flat c - metric @xcite , the original ads c - metric , eq .",
    "( [ ads c - metric ] ) , is not geodesically complete . to obtain the maximal analytic spacetime , i.e. , to draw the carter - penrose diagrams we will introduce the usual null kruskal coordinates .",

    "the ads c - metric found by plebaski and demiaski @xcite is characterized by a quite interesting new feature when compared with the c - metric in flat or de sitter backgrounds .",
    "indeed , contrarily to what happens in these two last solutions , in the ads background the solution only describes a pair of accelerated black holes if the acceleration parameter satisfies @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the cosmological length .",
    "the acceleration is caused by a strut that connects the black holes .",
    "the physical interpretation of the solutions has been essentially taken from the analysis of the carter - penrose diagrams ( following the approach of kinnersly and walker @xcite for the flat c - metric ) , from the embedding of the massless uncharged solution into the ads 4-hyperboloid in a 5d minkowski spacetime ( with two timelike coordinates ) , and from the physics of the strut .",
    "the alternative approach of bonnor @xcite which puts the flat c - metric into the weyl form can not be realized here , since the introduction of the cosmological constant prevents such a coordinate transformation .",
    "for @xmath0 , the embedding of the ads c - metric into 5d minkowski space clearly shows that the origin of the ads c - metric solution is subjected to a uniform acceleration , and describes a hyperbolic rindler - like worldline in the ads 4-hyperboloid embedded in the 5d minkowski space . to be more precise , the origin",
    "is represented by two hyperbolic lines that approach asymptotically the rindler - like accelerated horizon , so called because it is is absent when @xmath60 and present even when @xmath426 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "when we add a mass or a charge to the system the causal diagrams indicate that now we have two ads - schwarzschild or two ads@xmath269reissner - nordstrm black holes approaching asymptotically the rindler - like accelerated horizon .",
    "we have proceeded to the localization of the conical singularity present in the solution and concluded that it is between the two black holes and along the symmetry axis ( or alternatively from the black holes out to infinity ) . when it is between the two black holes , it is associated to a strut satisfying the relation @xmath427 , where @xmath428 and @xmath383 are respectively the pressure on the strut and its mass density .",
    "the pressure is positive , so it points outwards into infinity and pulls the black holes apart , furnishing their acceleration ( as in the flat c - metric ) .",
    "when the conical singularity points from each of the black holes into infinity , it is associated to a string with negative pressure that pushes the black holes into infinity . from the analysis of the carter - penrose diagrams we also concluded that the two black holes can not interact gravitationally .",
    "so , their acceleration is provided only by the pressure exerted by the strut .",
    "this is the reason why the limit @xmath60 of the c - metric does not reduce to the static solution of israel and khan @xcite .",
    "this solution describes two collinear schwarzschild black holes connected by a strut that exerts an outward pressure which cancels the inward gravitational attraction and so the distance between the two black holes remains fixed .",
    "for @xmath305 the above procedure indicates the absence of a second black hole and so the solution describes a single black hole . in the ads 4-hyperboloid",
    ", the origin of these solutions describes a circle in the plane defined by the two timelike coordinates . in",
    "a lower dimensional randall - sundrum model , it has been shown that the @xmath429 ads c - metric describes a black hole bound to a minkowski 2-brane moving in a 4d asymptotically ads background @xcite .",
    "the c - metric solution for generic @xmath6 has been used @xcite to describe the final state of the quantum process of pair creation of black holes , that once created accelerate apart by an external field . in this context",
    ", we expect that the black hole pair created in the ads background must have an acceleration @xmath13 .",
    "indeed , the ads background is globally contracting with an acceleration precisely equal to @xmath430 .",
    "therefore , a pair of virtual black holes created in this background can only become real if the black hole acceleration is greater than the contracting acceleration of the ads background , otherwise , the annihilation is inevitable",
    ". the quantum process that might create the pair would be the gravitational analogue of the schwinger pair production of charged particles in an external electromagnetic field .",
    "this would be one possible scenario to create two exactly equal black holes with the same acceleration that are described by the ads c - metric solution with @xmath0 .",

    "( [ c - metric ] ) ( see @xcite ) , @xmath431 and setting @xmath60 ( and @xmath89 ) one obtains @xmath432 where @xmath433 .",
    "so , when the acceleration parameter vanishes , the ads c - metric , eq .",
    "( [ c - metric ] ) , reduces to the ads - schwarzschild and ads@xmath269reissner - nordstrm black holes and the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 that are present in the ads c - metric are precisely the adm mass and adm electromagnetic charge of these non - accelerated black holes .",
    "it should however be emphasized that the accelerated black holes lose mass through radiative processes and so the determination of the mass of the accelerated black holes would require the calculation of the bondi mass , which we do not here .",
