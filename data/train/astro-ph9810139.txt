    "the x - ray emission of galactic black hole candidates ( bhcs ) displays different `` states '' characterized by distinct temporal and spectral properties @xcite . except for occasional transitions to the soft state",
    ", cyg x-1 spends most of its time in the hard state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : asm ] ) .",
    "it is therefore the prime candidate for evaluating accretion models of this fundamental black hole state .    since 1996",
    "the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) provides data from 3 to 200  with millisecond time - resolution . in this paper",
    "we derive a wide variety of spectral and temporal hard state properties by applying physical accretion disk corona models ( adcs ) ( sect .",
    "[ spectra ] ) as well as new timing methods ( sect .",
    "[ fourier ] and  [ lssm ] ) to a rxte hard state observation of cyg  x-1 .",
    "whereas adcs are very successful in explaining the observed spectrum @xcite , a unified model for the hard state accretion also has to take into account the time dependence of the emission .",
    "some of the associated constraints that are provided by the power spectral density , the coherence function , the time lags , and the lightcurve modeling with stochastic processes , are discussed in sections  [ fourier ] and  [ lssm ] . for further discussion see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "rxte observed cyg  x-1  for a total integrated source time of slightly more than 20ksec , starting 1996 october  23 , briefly after its transition to the hard state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : asm ] ) .",
    "we analyzed data from the proportional counter array ( pca ) as well as from the high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) .",
    "an overview of our data screening procedures and of the rxte instruments is given by @xcite and wilms et al .",
    "( this volume ) .",
    "for the spectral analysis we used 3 to 30  pca data and 20 to 200  hexte data .",
    "the temporal analysis is based on pca lightcurves with 1.95ms resolution from four energy bands of approximately equal count rates ( @xmath0(7001000)ctss@xmath1 per band ) .",
    "the energy bands are defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : psd ] , the total length of the lightcurves was @xmath218ksec .",
    "more details on the pca timing data of this observation are given by @xcite .",
    "the bhc hard state spectrum , a power - law with @xmath3 , modified by an exponential cutoff with @xmath4  is naturally explained by accretion disk corona ( adc ) models , i.e. , by comptonization of low - energy seed photons from a cold , geometrically thin accretion disk in a hot , semi - relativistic corona @xcite . as we explain in more detail in an accompanying paper ( wilms et al .",

    "* ) , we have developed an adc model in which the radiation field , the temperature and opacity of the corona , and the reprocessing of coronal radiation in the accretion disk are calculated self - consistently .",
    "the commonly assumed slab geometry where the accretion disk is sandwiched between two coronae is not self - consistent , since the coronal temperatures and opacities are not within the the physically allowed range of combinations of these parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "the sphere+disk geometry where the seed photons come from an accretion disk external to the inner spherical corona , allows to fit the broad - band spectrum of cyg  x-1  with _ one _ self - consistent model .    the best - fit spere+disk spectrum for our rxte observation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] .",
    "the deviations between the data and model above 10  are consistent with the current calibration uncertainty of the pca , while the deviation in the iron band between 5 and 10  shows the physical simplifications in our model .",
    "this does not pose a severe problem to the model since the deviations represent less than 1% of the total flux modeled",
    ". the deviation might be due to an underestimation of the covering factor for reflection , e.g. , by a possible overlap between the disk and the corona due to the transition from the soft to the hard state two weeks before the observation ( cf .",
    "[ fig : asm ] ) .",
    "the presence of accretion disk flares ( due to disk heating ) would also increase the reprocessing observed .",
    "finally , a slight increase in the fe abundance will also produce the stronger line seen in the data .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion of these points , as well as for a presentation of spectral fits using phenomenological `` standard '' models .",
    "we calculated power spectral densities ( psds ) by dividing the data into contiguous segments of uniform length and computing the fourier transform @xmath5 of each data segment .",
    "the discrete psd is then given by @xmath6 where the brackets indicate an average over data segments and logarithmic frequency bins ( fig .",
    "[ fig : psd ] , see also * ? ? ?",
    "the psds show characteristic hard state behavior ( cf .",
    "* ) . for 10@xmath7100hz",
    "the rms variability in all bands is about 30% .",
    "the psds are relatively flat for frequencies from 0.020.2hz . for higher frequencies ,",
    "they are roughly described by a steepening , broken power - law with a break at @xmath22hz , and typical slopes of @xmath81.0 , and @xmath81.5 , respectively .",
    "note that while there are no strong energy dependences , the high frequency slope does `` harden '' for higher energies .",
    "the coherence function , @xmath9 , is a frequency - dependent measure of the degree of linear correlation between two concurrent time series @xcite .",
    "specifically , it gives the fraction of the variability of one time series that can be predicted from the other .",
    "the coherence is based on the fourier transforms @xmath10 and @xmath11 , calculated for the soft and the hard lightcurve , respectively : @xmath12 where the brackets indicate an average over data segments and frequency bins and the star denotes complex conjugation .",
    "we computed the coherence function between the lowest energy band and the three higher ones using the same lightcurve segments and frequency rebinning as for the psds .",
    "the coherence is remarkably constant and unity over the broad frequency range from 0.02 to 10hz ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cof ] )  in agreement with previous results and contrary to theoretical expectations @xcite .",
    "this behavior of @xmath13 indicates that the comptonizing medium must be static on these timescales , despite the various possibilities for non - uniform coronae @xcite .    for all energy channels",
    "there is a trend for the coherence to drop below @xmath20.02hz and above @xmath210hz with the deviation from unity coherence generally becoming slightly greater for increasing energy difference .",
    "the loss of coherence below 0.02hz is consistent with the viscous timescale for @xmath14 , while the loss of coherence above 10hz is consistent with dynamical timescale for @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the distance from a 10@xmath17  black hole ) . for further discussion of the physical implications",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the fourier time lag is a frequency - dependent measure of the time delay between two time series . like the coherence it is calculated from",
    "their fourier transforms @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath18 @xmath19 can be either positive or negative . for our sign convention , a positive time lag indicates that the hard lightcurve lags the soft lightcurve .",
    "we computed the time lags for the same energy bands , lightcurve segments , and frequency bins as used for the coherence ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lag ] ) . within the frequency range that is",
    "not noise - dominated ( 0.130hz ) , the data are consistent with the softest energy band always leading the harder energy bands .",
    "the lags increase significantly with the energy difference between the bands and become larger for smaller frequencies , a result previously found by @xcite .",
    "the time lags range from @xmath20.002s to @xmath20.05s and can be very roughly described with a power law , @xmath20 , superposed by characteristic breaks at @xmath20.5 , 3 , and 10hz .",
    "the simplest expectation in the framework of comptonization models is that time delays should be due to different diffusion times through the corona and thus should be nearly independent of fourier frequency @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the overall energy dependence of the time lags is also not compatible with current comptonization models @xcite  including the sphere+disk model .",
    "it is therefore necessary to consider more complicated accretion models @xcite .",
    "the smallest observed time lags might indicate that the comptonizing medium is rather small , @xmath21 .",
    "consequently , if the time delays are due to disturbances propagating through the corona , the propagation speeds are extremly slow ( @xmath22(110%@xmath23 ) ) . these values are inconsistent with current adaf models .",
    "an alternative method to the timing analysis in the frequency domain is to examine the x - ray variability directly in the time domain by modeling the observed lightcurves with linear state space models ( lssms ) @xcite .",
    "these models describe the dynamics of a lightcurve @xmath24 with a stochastic , autoregressive ( ar ) process @xmath25 of order @xmath26 @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a gaussian white noise processes with zero mean and variance @xmath29 .",
    "the dynamical parameters , @xmath30 , are closely related to the temporal parameters characterizing the system .",
    "an ar[p=1 ] process , e.g. , is described by a single relaxation timescale @xmath31 .",
    "lssms also take the observational noise into account . for an ar[1 ]",
    "process @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the observational noise , again given by a gaussian white noise processes with zero mean and a variance of @xmath34 , and where @xmath23 is a constant .",
    "we fitted lssms of different order to 842 contiguous lightcurve segments ( 0.014.1 ) with a length of 16s each . to evaluate the goodness of the fits , a kolmogorov - smirnov test for white noise residuals was performed .",
    "we find that the lightcurves can be modeled with a lssm[1 ] process .",
    "this is consistent with our results for modeling exosat observations of cyg  x-1@xcite and in analogy to the latter work we derive a relaxation timescale @xmath35s for the rxte lightcurves .",
    "in contrast to the usually applied shot noise model fits in the frequency domain @xcite , the lssms of first order do not require pre - defined shot forms and are able to describe the rapid hard state variability of cyg  x-1  with _ one _ temporal parameter .",
    "the derived relaxator can in principle be used for scaling time dependent adc models , by fitting lssms to theoretical `` adc lightcurves '' .",
    "first estimates indicate much larger coronal radii than implied by the shortest time lags ( @xmath36 ) . for a better understanding of spectral und temporal hard state properties in one unified accretion scenario ,",
    "we plan to apply the models and methods presented here to further rxte observations of cyg  x-1  and other bhcs ."
