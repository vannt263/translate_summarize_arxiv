    "we know the light rays or photons would be deviated from their straight way when they pass close to the massive object such as black holes .",
    "this deflection of light rays well known as gravitational lensing .",
    "this gravitational lensing is one of the applications and results of general relativity @xcite and is used as an instrument in astrophysics because it can help us to extract the information about stars .",
    "the basics of gravitational lensing theory developed by liebes @xcite , refsdal @xcite , bourassa and kantowski @xcite . the gravitational lensing has been presented in details in @xcite and reviewed by some papers ( see for examples @xcite-@xcite ) . at this stage",
    ", the gravitational lensing is developed for weak field limit and could not describe some phenomena such as looping of light rays near the massive objects .",
    "hence , scientists were starting to study these phenomena from another point of view and they posed gravitational lensing in strong field limit .",
    "several studies about light rays close to the schwarzschild horizon have been done in literatures : a semi - analytical investigation about geodesics in kerr geometry has been made in @xcite , also the appearance of a black hole in front of a uniform background was studied in refs .",
    "recently , virbhadra and ellis @xcite shown when a source be highly aligned with schwarzschild black hole and the observer , one set of infinitive relativistic images would produce on each side of black hole .",
    "these images are produced when the light ray passes with impact parameter near to it , s minimum and winds one or several times around the black hole before reaching to observer . in refs @xcite ,",
    "the same problem was done with other methods .",
    "afterwards , the same technique applied to other black holes @xcite-@xcite , naked singularities and janis - newman - winicour metric @xcite .",
    "+ recently , the idea of large extra dimensions has attracted much attention @xcite to construct theories in which gravity be unified with other forces .",
    "the five - dimensional einstein - maxwell theory with a chern- simons term @xcite predicted five - dimensional charged black holes @xcite .",
    "such a higher - dimensional black holes would reside in a spacetime that is approximately isotropic in the vicinity of the black holes , but effectively four - dimensional far from the black holes @xcite .",
    "we call higher - dimensional black holes with this property kaluza - klein black holes",
    ". + presence of extra dimension is tested by quasinormal modes from the perturbation around the higher dimensional black hole @xcite and the spectrum of hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "the gravitational lensing is another method to investigate the extra dimension .",
    "thus , the study of strong gravitational lensing by higher dimensional black hole can help us to extract information about the extra dimension in astronomical observations in the future .",

    "we study the strong gravitational lensing in a charged squashed kaluza - klein black hole and peruse effects of the scale of extra dimension and charge of black hole on the coefficients and observables of strong gravitational lensing .",
    "+ the rest of this paper is organized as follows : the section 2 is briefly devoted to charged squashed kaluza - klein black hole metric . in section 3",
    "we use the bozza s method @xcite to obtain the deflection angle and other parameters of strong gravitational lensing as well as variation of them with extra dimension and charge of black hole . in section 4",
    ", we suppose that the supermassive object at the center of galaxy can be considered by the metric of charged squashed kaluza - klein black hole .",
    "then we evaluate the numerical results for the coefficients and observables in the strong gravitational lensing . in the last section ,",
    "we present a summary of our work .",
    "the charged squashed kaluza- klein black hole spacetime is considered as the metric @xcite @xmath4,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 the coordinates run in range , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , the functions in the metric define as @xmath10    here @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the mass and charge of the black hole respectively .",
    "the killing horizon of the black hole is given by the equation @xmath13 , that is @xmath14 .",
    "we see that the black hole have two horizons . as @xmath15 ,",
    "one has @xmath16 , which is the horizon of five - dimensional schwarzschild black hole , and for @xmath17 we have extremal black hole with a horizon @xmath18 . here",
    "we note that the argument of square root constraints the mass and charge values as , @xmath19 .",
    "when @xmath20 , we have @xmath21 , which means that the squashing effect disappears and the five - dimensional charged black hole is recovered . +",
    "by using the transformations , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , metric  ( [ metric1 ] ) can be written in the following form @xmath24 @xmath25    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the outer and inner horizons of the black hole in the new coordinate and @xmath0 is a scale of transition from five - dimensional spacetime to an effective four - dimensional one . by using coordinate transformation",
    "we can obtain @xmath28 in the following form @xmath29 where @xmath30 with @xmath31 note that @xmath32 . here @xmath33 , so that @xmath34 .",
    "the komar mass of black hole is related to @xmath35 with @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the four dimensional gravitational constant .",
    "as @xmath38 , the horizon of black hole becomes @xmath39 , which is consistent with that in the neutral squashed kaluza - klein black hole @xcite .",
    "we note that the square root in relation  ( [ eta ] ) constrains the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . for @xmath40 and @xmath41 ,",
    "the extremal black hole is obtained and admissible values for @xmath1 are between these two values . we have plotted the admissible region for @xmath0 and @xmath1 in figure 1 . also we have evaluated the admissible values for specific values , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , in table 1 .",
    "hereafter , our figures are plotted by considering the table 1 .",
    "variation of the radius of horizons are plotted in figure 2 .",
    "[ s ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "now , we are going to study the effects of the scale parameter @xmath0 and charge of black hole @xmath1 on the observables in the strong gravitational lensing .",
    "if we suppose that the spacetime of the supersessive black hole at the galaxy center of milky way can be considered by a charged squashed kaluza - klein black hole then , we can estimate the numerical values for the coefficients and observables of gravitational lensing in the strong field limit .",
    "+ we can write the lens equation in strong gravitational lensing , as the source , lens , and observer are highly aligned as follows @xcite @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the distance between the lens and source .",
    "@xmath44 is the distance between the observer and the source so that , @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 and @xmath47 are the angular position of the source and the image with respect to lens , respectively .",

    "+ the @xmath49-th image position @xmath50 and the @xmath49-th image magnification @xmath51 can be approximated as follows @xcite @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 is the angular position of @xmath55 . in the limit @xmath56",
    ", the relation between the minimum of impact parameter @xmath57 and asymptotic position of a set of images @xmath58 can be expressed by @xmath59 . in order to obtain the coefficients @xmath60 and @xmath61 , in the simplest case , we separate the outermost image @xmath62 and all the remaining ones which packed together at @xmath58 , as done in refs @xcite . thus @xmath63 is considered as the angular separation between the first image and other ones and the ratio of the flux of them is given by @xmath64 we can simplify the observables and rewrite them in the following form @xmath65 thus , by measuring the @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath58 , one can obtain the values of the coefficients @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath57 .",
    "if we compare these values by those obtained in the previous section , we could detect the size of the extra dimension and charge of black hole .",
    "another observable for gravitational lensing is relative magnification of the outermost relativistic image with the other ones .",
    "this observable is showed by @xmath68 which is related to @xmath69 by @xmath70 using @xmath71 and equations  ( [ a ] ) ,  ( [ sr ] ) and  ( [ rm ] ) we can estimate the values of the coefficients @xmath60 and @xmath61 , in the strong field gravitational lensing .",
    "variation of the observables @xmath58 , @xmath66 and @xmath68 are plotted in figures 8 - 10 .",
    "note that the mass of the central object of our galaxy is estimated to be @xmath72 and the distance between the sun and the center of galaxy is @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "+ for the different @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the numerical values for main observables and the strong field limit coefficients for the black hole at center of our galaxy which is supposed to be described by the charged squashed kaluza - klein black hole are listed in table 2 .",
    "one can see that our results reduce to those in the four - dimensional schwarzschild black hole as @xmath74 and also our results are in agreement with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite in the limit @xmath38 .",
    "the extra dimension in one of the important predictions in string theory which is believed to be promising candidate for the unified theory .",
    "the five - dimensional einstein - maxwell theory with a chern- simons term in string theory predicted five - dimensional charged black holes .",
    "we considered the charged squashed kaluza - klein black hole spacetime and investigated the strong gravitational lensing by this metric .",
    "we obtained theoretically the deflection angle and other parameters of strong gravitational lensing and studied variation of them with respect to extra dimension and charge of black hole .",
    "finally we estimated numerically the values of observables i.e. relativistic images @xmath58 , the angular separation @xmath66 and the relative magnitudes @xmath68 for different @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
