    "in part i , @xcite we derived a quantum generalization of classical transition - state theory ( tst ) , which corresponds to the @xmath0  limit of a new form of quantum flux - side time - correlation function .",
    "this function uses a ring - polymer @xcite dividing surface , which is invariant under cyclic permutation of the polymer beads , and thus becomes invariant to imaginary - time translation in the infinite - bead limit .",
    "the resulting quantum tst appears to be unique , in the sense that the @xmath0  limit of any other known form of flux - side time - correlation function @xcite gives either incorrect quantum statistics , or zero .",
    "remarkably , this quantum tst is _ identical _ to ring - polymer molecular dynamics ( rpmd ) tst , @xcite and thus validates a large number of recent rpmd rate calculations,@xcite as well as the earlier - developed ` quantum tst method'@xcite ( which is rpmd - tst in the special case of a centroid dividing surface,@xcite and which , to avoid confusion , we will refer to here as ` centroid - tst'@xcite ) .",
    "there are a variety of other methods for estimating the quantum rate based on short - time@xcite or semiclassical@xcite dynamics .",
    "what is different about quantum tst is that it corresponds to the instantaneous @xmath2 quantum flux through a dividing surface .",
    "classical tst corresponds to the analogous @xmath0  classical flux , which is well known to give the exact ( classical ) rate if there is no recrossing of the dividing surface;@xcite in practice , there is always some such recrossing , and thus classical tst gives a _ good approximation _ to the exact ( classical ) rate for systems in which the amount of recrossing is small , namely direct reactions .",
    "the purpose of this article is to derive the analogous result for quantum tst ( i.e.  rpmd - tst ) , to show that it gives the exact quantum rate if there is no recrossing ( by the exact quantum dynamics@xcite ) , and thus that it gives a good approximation to the exact quantum rate for direct reactions .    to clarify the work ahead ,",
    "we summarize two important differences between classical and quantum tst .",
    "first , classical tst gives a strict upper bound to the corresponding exact rate , but quantum tst does not , since real - time coherences may increase the quantum flux upon recrossing.@xcite quantum tst breaks down if such coherences are large ; one then has no choice but to attempt to model the real - time quantum dynamics .",
    "however , in many systems ( especially in the condensed phase ) , real - time quantum coherence has a negligible effect on the rate . in such systems ,",
    "quantum tst gives a _ good approximation to _ an upper bound to the exact quantum rate .",
    "this becomes a strict upper bound only in the high - temperature limit , where classical tst is recovered as a special limiting case .",
    "second , when discussing recrossing in classical tst , one has only to consider whether trajectories initiated on the dividing surface recross that surface . in quantum tst ,",
    "the time - evolution operator is applied to a series of @xmath3 initial positions , corresponding to the positions of the polymer beads . a consequence of this , as we discuss below ,",
    "is that one needs to consider , not just recrossing ( by the exact quantum dynamics ) of the ring - polymer dividing surface , but also of surfaces orthogonal to it in the ( @xmath4)-dimensional space describing fluctuations in the polymer - bead positions along the reaction coordinate .",
    "a major task of this article will be to show that the recrossing of these surfaces ( by the exact quantum dynamics ) causes the long - time limit of the ring - polymer flux - side time - correlation function to differ from the exact quantum rate .",
    "it then follows that the rpmd - tst rate is equal to the exact quantum rate if there is neither recrossing of the ring - polymer dividing surface , nor of any of these @xmath4 orthogonal surfaces",
    ".    we will use quantum scattering theory to derive these results , although we emphasise that they apply also in condensed phases ( where rpmd has proved particularly groundbreaking @xcite ) .",
    "the scattering theory is employed merely as a derivational tool , exploiting the property that the flux - side plateau in a scattering system extends to infinite time , which makes derivation of the rate straightforward .",
    "the results thus derived can be applied in the condensed phase , subject to the usual caveat of there being a separation in timescales between barrier - crossing and equilibration .",
    "@xcite we have relegated most of the scattering theory to appendices , in the hope that the outline of the derivation can be followed in the main body of the text .",
    "the article is structured as follows : after summarizing the main findings of part i in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce in sec .",
    "iii a hybrid flux - side time - correlation function , which correlates flux through the ring - polymer dividing surface with the miller - schwarz - tromp@xcite side function , and which gives the exact quantum rate in the limit @xmath5 .",
    "we describe the @xmath3-dimensional integral over momenta obtained in this limit by an @xmath3-dimensional hypercube , and note that the @xmath5 limits of the ring - polymer and hybrid flux - side time - correlation functions cut out different volumes from the hypercube , thus explaining why the former does not in general give the exact quantum rate . in sec .",
    "iv we show that the only parts of the integrand that cause this difference are a series of dirac @xmath6-function spikes running through the hypercube . in sec .",
    "v we show that these spikes disappear if there is no recrossing ( by the exact quantum dynamics@xcite ) in the ( @xmath4)-dimensional space orthogonal to the dividing surface ( mentioned above ) .",
    "it then follows that the rpmd - tst rate is equal to the exact rate if there is also no recrossing of the dividing surface itself . in sec .",

    "the only formal properties of hypercubes that we need are , first that a hypercube has @xmath67 vertices , second that one can represent the hypercube by constructing a graph showing the connections between its vertices , and third that the graph for a hypercube of dimension @xmath3 can be made by connecting equivalent vertices on the graphs of two hypercubes of dimension @xmath68 .",
