    "some recent empirical research papers , including nielsen , srensen and taber ( 2010 ) , landais ( 2015 ) , simonsen , skipper and skipper ( 2015 ) , card , lee , pei and weber ( 2016 ) , and dong ( 2016 ) , conduct causal inference via the regression kink design ( rkd ) .",
    "a natural extension of the rkd with a flavor of unobserved heterogeneity is the quantile rkd ( qrkd ) , which is the object that we explore in this paper .",
    "specifically , consider the quantile derivative wald ratio of the form @xmath0 at a design point @xmath1 of a running variable @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes the @xmath4-th conditional quantile function of @xmath5 given @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is a policy function .",
    "note that it is analogous to the rkd estimand of card , lee , pei and weber ( 2016 ) : @xmath8 - \\lim_{x \\uparrow x_0 } \\frac { \\partial}{\\partial x } \\operatorname{\\text{e}}[y\\mid x = x]}{\\lim_{x \\downarrow x_0 } \\frac { d}{d x } b(x ) - \\lim_{x \\uparrow x_0 } \\frac { d}{d x } b(x)},\\ ] ] except that the conditional expectations in the numerator are replaced by the corresponding conditional quantiles . while the qrkd estimand ( [ eq : wald ] ) is of potential interest in the empirical literature for assessment of heterogeneous treatment effects ( e.g. , landais ( 2011 ) considers ( [ eq : wald ] ) ) ,",
    "little seems known about theories of identification , estimation , and inference .",
    "this paper develops causal interpretation ( identification ) and estimation theories for the qrkd estimand ( [ eq : wald ] ) .",
    "consequently , we also propose methods of inference for heterogeneous treatment effects based on the qrkd .",
    "causal analysis for types of estimands in the wald - ratio form , like ( [ eq : wald ] ) and ( [ eq : mean_wald ] ) , dates back to the seminal paper by imbens and angrist ( 1994 ) .",
    "making causal interpretations of the qrkd estimand ( [ eq : wald ] ) is perhaps more challenging than the mean rkd estimand ( [ eq : mean_wald ] ) because the differentiation operator @xmath9 and the conditional quantile do not ` swap . ' for the mean rkd estimand ( [ eq : mean_wald ] ) , the interchangeability of the differentiation operator and the expectation ( integration ) operator allows each term of the numerator in ( [ eq : mean_wald ] ) to be additively decomposed into two parts , namely the causal effects and the endogeneity effects .",
    "taking the difference of two terms in the numerator then cancels out the endogeneity effects , leaving only the causal effects .",
    "this trick allows the mean rkd estimand ( [ eq : mean_wald ] ) to have causal interpretations in the presence of endogeneity . due to the lack of such interchangeability for the case of quatiles ,",
    "this trick is not straightforwardly inherited by the quantile counterpart ( [ eq : wald ] ) .",
    "having said this , we show in section [ sec : identification_rank_invariance ] and more formally in section [ sec : identification ] that a similar decomposition is possible for the qrkd estimand ( [ eq : wald ] ) , and therefore argue that its causal interpretations are possible even under the lack of monotonicity .",
    "specifically , we show that the qrkd estimand corresponds to the quantile marginal effect under monotonicity and to a weighted average of marginal effects under non - monotonicity and/or with fuzzy design in a similar manner to card , lee , pei and weber ( 2016 ) .    for estimation of the causal effects ,",
    "we propose a sample - counterpart estimator for the qrkd estimand ( [ eq : wald ] ) in sections [ sec : estimation ] . to derive its asymptotic properties , we take advantage of the existing literature on uniform bahadur representations for quantile - type loss functions , including kong , linton and xia ( 2010 ) , guerre and sabbah ( 2012 ) , sabbah ( 2014 ) , and qu and yoon ( 2015a ) .",
    "qu and yoon ( 2015b ) apply the results of qu and yoon ( 2015a ) to develop methods of statistical inference with quantile regression discontinuity designs ( qrdd ) , which are closely related to our qrkd framework .",
    "we take a similar approach with suitable modifications to derive asymptotic properties of our qrkd estimator .",
    "weak convergence results for the estimator as a quantile process are derived . applying the weak convergence results , we propose procedures for testing treatment significance and treatment heterogeneity following koenker and xiao ( 2002 ) , chernozhukov and fernndez - val ( 2005 ) and qu and yoon ( 2015b ) .",
    "simulation studies presented in section [ sec : mc ] support the theoretical properties .    literature : the method studied in this paper fall in the broad framework of design - based causal inference , including rdd and rkd .",
    "there is an extensive body of literature on rdd by now ",
    "see for example the special issue of _ journal of econometrics _ edited by imbens and lemieux ( 2008 ) and the literature reviews by imbens and wooldridge ( 2009 ; sec .",
    "6.4 ) and lee and lemieux ( 2010 ) .",
    "the first extension to quantile treatment effects in the rdd framework was made by frandsen , frlich and melly ( 2012 ) .",
    "more recently , qu and yoon ( 2015b ) develop uniform inference methods with qrdd that empirical researchers can use to test a variety of important empirical questions on heterogeneous treatment effects .",
    "while the rdd has a rich set of empirical and theoretical results including the quantile extensions , the rkd method which developed more recently does not have a quantile counterpart in the literature yet , despite potential demands for it by empirical researchers ( e.g. , landais , 2011 ) .",
    "our paper can be seen as either a quantile extension to card , lee , pei and weber ( 2016 ) or a rkd counterpart of frandsen , frlich and melly ( 2012 ) and qu and yoon ( 2015b ) .",
    "in this section , we develop some causal interpretations of the qrkd estimand ( [ eq : wald ] ) . for the purpose of illustration , we first present a simple case with rank invariance in section [ sec : identification_rank_invariance ] .",
    "it is followed by a formal argument for general cases in section [ sec : identification ] .",
    "the causal relation of interest is represented by the structural equation @xmath10 the outcome @xmath11 is determined through the structural function @xmath12 by two observed factors , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and a scalar unobserved factor , @xmath15 .",
    "we assume that @xmath12 is monotone increasing in @xmath16 , effectively imposing the rank invariance ; causal interpretations in a more general setup with non - monotone @xmath12 and/or multivariate @xmath16 is established in section [ sec : identification ] .",
    "the factor @xmath7 is a treatment input , and is in turn determined by the running variable @xmath2 through the structural equation @xmath17 for a known policy function @xmath7 .",
    "we say that @xmath7 has a kink at @xmath1 if @xmath18 is true , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 mean @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume that the location , @xmath1 , of the kink is known from a policy - based research design , as is the case with card , lee , pei and weber ( 2016 ) .",
    "[ a : policy treatment ] @xmath23 holds , and @xmath7 is continuous on @xmath24 and differentiable on @xmath25 .",
    "the structural partial effects are @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "in particular , a researcher is interested in @xmath29 which measures heterogeneous partial effects of the treatment intensity @xmath7 on an outcome @xmath11 . while the structural partial effect @xmath29 is of interest",
    ", it is not clear if the qrkd estimand ( [ eq : wald ] ) provides any information about @xmath29 . in this section",
    ", we argue that ( [ eq : wald ] ) does have a causal interpretation in the sense that it measures the structural causal effect @xmath30 at the @xmath4-th conditional quantile of @xmath31 given @xmath32 .    under regularity conditions ( to be discussed in section [ sec : identification ] in detail ) , some calculations yield the decomposition @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side is the partial effect of the running variable @xmath2 on the outcome @xmath11 through the policy function @xmath7 .",
    "the second term is the direct partial effect of the running variable on the outcome @xmath11 .",
    "the third term measures the effect of endogeneity in the running variable @xmath2 .",
    "we can see that this third term is zero under exogeneity , @xmath35 . in order to get the causal effect @xmath36 of interest through the qrkd estimand ( [ eq : wald ] ) , therefore ,",
    "we want to remove the last two terms in ( [ eq : intuitive_decomposition ] ) .",
    "suppose that the designed kink condition of assumption [ a : policy treatment ] is true , but all the other functions , @xmath29 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , in the right - hand side of ( [ eq : intuitive_decomposition ] ) are continuous in @xmath41 at @xmath42 . then , ( [ eq : intuitive_decomposition ] ) yields @xmath43 showing that the qrkd estimand ( [ eq : wald ] ) measures the structural causal effect @xmath30 of @xmath7 on @xmath11 for the subpopulation of individuals at the @xmath4-th conditional quantile of @xmath31 given @xmath32 .",

    "we may derive a similar causal interpretation for the case of fuzzy qrkd ",
    "see section [ sec : fuzzy ] in the supplementary appendix . as is often the case in the treatment literature ( e.g. , angrist and imbens , 1995 )",
    ", this theorem shows a causal interpretation in terms of a weighted average .",
    "specifically , ( [ eq : id ] ) shows that the qrkd estimand ( [ eq : wald ] ) measures a weighted average of the heterogeneious causal effects @xmath30 displayed on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : id ] ) .",
    "the weights given in the definition of @xmath94 are proportional to @xmath95 which is positive on the conditional support of @xmath31 given @xmath32 .",
    "in other words , the qrkd estimand measures a strict convex combination of the ceteris paribus causal effects of @xmath7 on @xmath11 for those individuals at the @xmath4-th conditional quantile of @xmath5 given @xmath32 .",
    "one may worry about the obscurity of the causal interpretations under the ` weighted ' averages .",
    "there are two special cases where the qrkd estimand allows for causal interpretations in terms of purely unweighted averages , i.e. , @xmath96 is constant in @xmath16 .",
    "one example is the case where the structural function @xmath97 is monotone in a scalar unobservable @xmath16 , which is the special case discussed in section [ sec : identification_rank_invariance ] .",
    "the other example is the more general case where the structure exhibits partial additivity , e.g. , @xmath98 .",
    "when an empirical practitioner is reluctant to make either of these assumptions , the qrkd estimand can be still interpreted as a weighted average measurement of the treatment effects among the subpopulation of individuals at the @xmath4-th conditional quantile of @xmath5 given @xmath32 . in either of these cases , heterogeneity in values of the qrkd estimand across quantiles",
    "@xmath4 can be used as evidence for heterogeneity in treatment effects .",

    "we remark that the latter fact does not contradict with our theory , because the practical choice of optimal bandwidth based on an approximate mse fails to under - smooth the estimates while our theory of asymptotic distribution without bias reduction requires an under - smoothing .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we can observe the following patterns in these result tables .",
    "first , the estimated causal effects have positive signs throughout all the quantiles , implying that higher benefit amounts cause longer unemployment durations consistently across all the outcome levels .",
    "second , these causal effects are smaller and insignificant at lower quantiles , while they are larger and significantly different from zero at middle and higher quantiles .",
    "this pattern implies that unemployed individuals who have longer unemployment durations tend to have larger unemployment elasticities with respect to benefit levels .",
    "this result is consistent with a simple intuitive story ; individuals with longer unemployment durations are associated with lower abilities and are therefore more likely to show moral hazard .",
    "the extent of this increase of the causal effects in quantiles is more prominent for the results in table [ tab : empirical1981 ] ( 19811982 ) than in table [ tab : empirical1982 ] ( 19821983 ) .",
    "third , the causal effects are very similar between the results for claimed ui as the outcome and the results for paid ui as the outcome variable .",
    "the respective standard errors are almost the same between these two outcome variables , but they are not exactly the same .",
    "fourth , the uniform tests show that the causal effects are significantly different from zero for the both time periods .",
    "lastly , the uniform tests show that the causal effects are significantly heterogeneous in table [ tab : empirical1981 ] ( 19811982 ) , while the heterogeneity is insignificant in table [ tab : empirical1982 ] ( 19821983 ) .",
    "the asymmetry in the last results may stem from different macro - economic environments between the two time periods : the u.s .",
    "economy experienced a recession in most of the period 19811982 while it was in recovery during the period 19821983 .",
    "economists have taken advantage of policy irregularities to assess causal effects of endogenous treatment intensities . a new approach along this line is the regression kink design ( rkd ) used by recent empirical papers , including nielsen , srensen and taber ( 2010 ) , landais ( 2015 ) , simonsen , skipper and skipper ( 2015 ) , card , lee , pei and weber ( 2016 ) , and dong ( 2016 ) .",
    "while the prototypical framework is only able to assess the average treatment effect at the kink point , inference for heterogeneous treatment effects using the rkd is of potential interest by empirical researchers ( e.g. , landais ( 2011 ) considers it ) . in this light",
    ", this paper develops causal analysis and methods for the quantile regression kink design ( qrkd ) .",
    "we first develop causal interpretations of the qrkd estimand .",
    "it is shown that the qrkd estimand measures the marginal effect of the treatment variable on the outcome variable at the conditional quantile of the outcome given the design point of the running variable provided that the causal structure exhibits rank invariance .",
    "this result is generalized to the case of no rank invariance , where the qrkd estimand is shown to measure a weighted average of the marginal effects of the treatment variable on the outcome variable at the conditional quantile of the outcome given the design point of the running variable .",
    "second , we propose a sample counterpart qrkd estimator , and develop its asymptotic properties for statistical inference of heterogeneous treatment effects . using uniform bahadur representations , we obtain a weak consistency result for the qrkd estimator . applying the weak consistency result , we propose procedures for statistical tests of treatment significance and treatment heterogeneity .",
    "simulation studies support our theoretical results . applying our methods to the continuous wage and benefit history project ( cwbh ) data , we find significantly heterogeneous causal effects of unemployment insurance benefits on unemployment durations in the state of louisiana for the period between september 1981 and september 1982 . finally ,",
