    "according to a widely accepted scenario , the outer planets of the solar system are embedded in a gas - free disk of planetesimals in the last stage of planetary formation .",

    "planetesimals are scattered by the planets in a chaotic manner .",
    "orbital angular momentum and energy are exchanged resulting in planetary migration eventually with significant orbital changes .",
    "this phenomenon , described extensively for the first time by fernandez and ip ( 1984 ) , was invoked then to suggest pluto s capture in a 3/2 resonance by neptune during its outward migration @xcite .    at what heliocentric distances did the planets form and how far did they migrate ?",
    "two major models are proposed : in the first model investigated by fernandez and ip ( 1984 ) and applied by malhotra ( 1993 ) , initial planetary orbits are widely spaced between 5.2 and about 25 au .",
    "a recently proposed model , the nice model @xcite , assumes an initially closely spaced distribution between 5.3 and 17 au . in the latter model , uranus and neptune exchange their orbits during migration .",
    "the two migration models differ mainly in the assumption of the initial semimajor axes of the planets .",
    "the driving mechanism for planetary migration is the same : planets scatter planetesimals in - and outwards .",
    "inwards scattering moves a planet outwards while it moves inwards when a planet scatters a planetesimal outwards . in a closed system in equilibrium without loss of planetesimals where planets scatter planetesimals in- and outwards",
    ", no significant migration would occur . in an open system with loss of planetesimals , on the other hand ,",
    "significant planetary migration is possible .",
    "jupiter plays a crucial role since it ejects easily planetesimals received from the other planets out of the solar system . as a consequence",
    ", jupiter migrates towards the sun while the other three planets migrate outwards .",
    "migration is halted when the outermost planet reaches the edge of the planetesimal disk and when most of the planetesimals scattered between the planets are removed .",
    "jupiter and saturn cross in the nice model the 2:1 mean motion resonance ( mmr ) soon after planetary migration has started . as a consequence , the eccentricities of both planetary orbits increase .",
    "saturn approaches the orbit of the third planet which is excited and which , therefore , has close approaches with the fourth planet .",
    "the third and fourth planet may exchange orbits which moves the third planet rapidly towards 20 au deep inside the planetesimal disk surrounding in the beginning the four planets .",
    "dynamical friction with planetesimals damps rapidly enough planetary eccentricities to avoid close encounters between the third and fourth planet which would result eventually in a destabilization of the outer planetary system .",
    "the planetary orbits separate due to migration and their eccentricities are damped to present values due to dynamical friction .    in a scenario where jupiter and saturn cross the 2:1 mmr ,",
    "jupiter trojans are destabilized .",
    "the destabilization was first attributed to the particular perturbations of the 2:1 mmr solely @xcite .",
    "later , morbidelli et al .",
    "( 2005 ) attributed the destabilization to the 3/1 secondary resonance between harmonics of the libration frequency of trojan orbits and a critical argument of the 2:1 mmr .",
    "this secondary resonance is very effective to remove trojans in case of a very low migration speed . within a frozen model without migration ,",
    "all trojans are removed @xcite on a timescale of about 1 myr .",
    "one can not exclude , however , that a considerable fraction of trojans survives since each secondary resonance is quite narrow and trojans may pass through . in this paper , we will show that due to the presence of a major secular resonance on both sides of the 2:1 mmr , original trojans are removed due to the synergy between secondary and secular resonances independently of the planet migration rate .",
    "in addition , the lock of jupiter s and saturn s orbits into apsidal corotation after the 2:1 mmr crossing significantly contributes to the destabilization until the locking is broken .",
    "while primordial trojans are destabilized before , during and after the crossing of the 2:1 mmr , nearby planetesimals can be temporarily trapped on trojan orbits via the reverse chaotic path .",
    "as soon as jupiter leaves the extended instability region , the latest captured trojans remain locked on tadpole orbits for long timescales comparable to the age of the planetary system .",
    "morbidelli et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have shown that the orbital distribution of the observed trojans corresponds to the orbital distribution of the captured trojans .",
    "temporary trapping in coorbital motion appears to occur still at present .",
    "@xcite described temporary captures in horseshoe orbits and @xcite identified about 20 transitional objects in a sample of about 1200 trojans .",
    "candidates are centaurs that can be trapped as trojans for short periods of @xmath0 yrs @xcite .",
    "this shows that the stable region for jupiter trojans is surrounded by a chaotic layer @xcite where a population of temporary trojans resides . at present , the stable and unstable regions are well separated and an object residing in the transient population can not become a permanent jupiter trojan without the help of a non - conservative process .",
    "there are some slow diffusion gates from the stable to the unstable region like those identified by @xcite related to commensurabilities between the secular frequency of the trojan perihelion longitude and the frequency of the great inequality ( 2:5 almost resonance between the present jupiter and saturn ) .",
    "however , it is very unlikely that a transient trojan can follow in the reverse sense these paths to became a permanent trojan .",
    "we describe in section 2 the major perturbations acting near the 2:1 mmr on jupiter trojans in the early phase of the nice migration model .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the synergy of these major perturbations leading to a total loss of a possible initial trojan population independent of migration rates . in section 4",
    "we show that perturbations in the central jupiter - saturn 2:1 mmr region , where at least one of the resonant arguments librates , do not lead to global instability even in a frozen model as suggested by michtchenko et al .",
    "a frequency map analysis reveals extended stable regions .",
    "in this section we describe the sweeping of resonances through the trojan region before and after the 2:1 mmr crossing of jupiter and saturn .",
    "the goal of our numerical modellig is to explore the stability of trojan orbits during the migration of jupiter and saturn through the 2:1 mmr .",
    "the migration rates of the two planets have to be computed within a model that includes all the outer planets and a disk of massive planetesimals as described in @xcite .",
    "for this reason we have first reproduced the dynamical evolution of the outer planets using the same model of @xcite and adopting the same symba5 numerical algorithm @xcite .",
    "it is a symplectic integrator that models the gravitational interactions among planets , the gravitational forces exerted by the planets on planetesimals and vice versa .",
    "the gravitational interactions among planetesimals is omitted in order to gain computing time .",
    "symba5 is particularly designed to handle close encounters among planetesimals and planets , the main mechanism driving the migration of the outer planets . using the starting conditions for the planets described in @xcite for relatively slow migration",
    ", we performed a numerical simulation that matches closely that shown in @xcite .",
    "hereinafter , we refer to this simulation as pps ( planets and planetesimals simulation ) .",
    "the four outer planets are started on closely packed , almost circular and coplanar orbits .",
    "the semimajor axes @xmath1 of jupiter and saturn are 5.45 and 8.50 , respectively , so that they will cross the 2:1 mmr during their migration .",
    "orbital eccentricities @xmath2 and inclinations @xmath3 are equal to 0.001 at start . following @xcite",
    ", we use 4500 massive planetesimals to produce the migration of the four planets .         in fig .",
    "[ juppa ] we show the semimajor axis and eccentricity of jupiter as obtained in our pps simulation . before the 2:1 mmr crossing ,",
    "jupiter s eccentricity is equal on average to 0.01 in spite of its small starting value .",
    "this is due to the forced component of saturn which grows while approaching the resonance location .",
    "the 2:1 mmr crossing is marked by a sudden jump in eccentricity related to the separatrix crossing and by large oscillations in semimajor axis .",
    "after the crossing , the eccentricity is slowly damped down while the planet continues to migrate towards its present location .    from the time series of the orbital elements of both jupiter and saturn , computed within the pps simulation , we can derive the planet migration rate @xmath4 of the semimajor axis and the eccentricity damping rate @xmath5 and produce a _",
    "synthetic _ model . in this model",
    "the effect of the planetesimal scattering is simulated by adding analytically the @xmath4 and @xmath5 terms to the equations of motion of the planets .",
    "such an approach was exploited to model the effect of circumstellar disks on exoplanets , for instance by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the authors used analytic expressions to estimate the changes in @xmath1 and @xmath2 due to the interactions with the disk when advancing the planets from time @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "we follow the formalism outlined in the appendix of the paper by @xcite and , to model the migration of planets , we introduce a @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the symba5 integrator to produce the migration and neglect all the massive planetesimals .",
    "we concentrate on the orbital evolution of jupiter and saturn since thay are responsible for the stability or instability of jupiter trojans .",
    "uranus and neptune are needed in the pps model in order to transport the planetesimals responsible for the migration of the outer planetary system . however , by a series of numerical tests , we have verified that their influence on the trojan orbits of jupiter is negligible compared to that of jupiter itself and saturn .    in the synthetic model",
    "we must account for the fact that the migration of jupiter and saturn caused by planetesimal encounters is linear only over a limited amount of time and not over the whole migration period .",
    "the number of planetesimals in planet crossing orbits is in fact declining causing a slow decrease of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we , therefore , tune the synthetic integrator to the pps run by using values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 that are derived from pps at different times during the evolution of jupiter and saturn . in this way",
    ", the synthetic model accurately reproduces the evolution of the planets during the 2:1 mmr and even after .",
    "moreover , it retains all the dynamical features needed to analyse the stability of jupiter trojans .",
    "the initial values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 for jupiter are @xmath8 au / year and @xmath9 1/year , respectively . after 10 myr",
    "these values have decreased to @xmath10 au / year and @xmath11 1/year . for saturn ,",
    "the @xmath4 ranges from @xmath12 to @xmath13 au / year in 10 myr while the @xmath5 goes from @xmath14 to @xmath15 1/year .",
    "the main advantage of using the synthetic integrator is its speed .",
    "we can compute the orbital evolution of jupiter and saturn and of massless trojans on a timescale at least 100 times shorter than that required by a full model that includes the massive planetesimals ( pps  type model ) .",
    "cpu time is a critical issue since we have to explore the stability of trojans in the phase space for different intervals of time during migration and in different dynamical configurations .",
    "in addition , with the synthetic model there is the possibility of easily changing the values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 which are strongly model dependent .",
    "we tested also a synthetic model based on the radau integrator and the results were in agreement with the symba5 synthetic model .    to identify possible resonances between the motion of the planets and that of trojans we have to evaluate the major orbital frequencies of these bodies .",
    "however , the dynamical system evolves because of planetary migration and the frequencies change with time . to compute the value of these frequencies at a given instant of time we use _ frozen _ models .",
    "we extract the osculating orbital elements of the planets and trojans at the required time and start a numerical integration of the trajectories with the migration switched off ( both @xmath4 and @xmath5 are set to 0 ) . in this way",
    ", we compute a time series of orbital elements for the non  migrating planets and trojans long enough to derive precise values of the frequencies .    to compute initial orbital elements for trojans at different times during the evolution of the planetary system we select random initial conditions within a ring surrounding the orbit of jupiter .",
    "the semimajor axis of any putative trojan is selected in between @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath17 where @xmath17 is the semimajor axis of jupiter .",

    "the choice of wide ranges in eccentricity and libration amplitude , somewhat wider than the present ones , is dictated by the chaotic evolution of the orbital elements before , during and after the 2:1 mmr crossing .",
    "this chaotic evolution can drive a given trojan orbit from a high eccentric orbit into an almost circular one , and it can strongly reduce its libration amplitude .",
