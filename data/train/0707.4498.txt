    "the production of neutron - capture elements early in the universe is recorded in the abundances of galactic halo stars .",
    "the two mechanisms responsible for generating most neutron - capture elements are the @xmath0-process and the @xmath2-process , with the @xmath0-process generating about half of the nuclides with @xmath3 .",
    "the observed @xmath0-process abundance distribution in metal - poor halo stars diverges above and below @xmath4 into two distinct patterns .",
    "these patterns are defined by their consistency with the solar and halo star @xmath0-process abundances . the low r - process pattern ( @xmath5 )",
    "is not consistent with either the solar @xmath0-process abundances or among individual halo stars .",
    "however , the high abundance ( @xmath6 ) pattern , known as the main @xmath0-process , is very consistent among both the available halo star data and the solar system @xmath0-process abundances @xcite .",
    "we suggest the existence of a main @xmath0-process implies that a robust mechanism is producing elements from the second ( @xmath7 ) through the third ( @xmath8 ) @xmath0-process peak region @xcite .    while there has been success in observing the abundance fingerprints of the @xmath0-process , determining the astrophysical production site(s ) remains an open question @xcite .",
    "a promising candidate site for the @xmath0-process is the neutrino - driven wind of the post - bounce core - collapse supernova , as the amount of @xmath0-process material ejected can account for the galactic abundances @xcite .",
    "also , the frequency of the core - collapse supernova event is sufficiently rapid to produce @xmath0-process material early in the universe , in accordance with the @xmath0-process abundances observed in very metal - poor stars @xcite .",
    "however , traditional models of the neutrino - driven wind do not quite yield an @xmath0-process due to the low free neutron abundance at the @xmath0-process epoch @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-process requires a neutron - to - seed ratio of @xmath9 for production of the heaviest , @xmath8 , peak .",
    "uncertainties in the wind model may be responsible for this shortcoming as @xmath10 is related to both the entropy , @xmath11 , and the dynamical timescale , @xmath12 , and both are sensitive to the the proto - neutron star physics , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite ; an increase of @xmath11 and a decrease of @xmath12 both lead to a higher initial neutron - to - seed ratio , @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "these changes would likely require a compact and/or massive proto - neutron star @xcite .",
    "additional studies have looked to a prompt supernova explosion mechanism for producing the neutron - rich conditions necessary for the @xmath0-process @xcite , although the physical realization of a prompt explosion scenario remains uncertain @xcite .",
    "an avenue that has been suggested for generating a suitable neutron - to - seed ratio is a shocked wind solution . a supersonic wind expansion , reducing seed formation during the @xmath13-particle formation epoch , is followed by a deceleration at late times @xcite which allows the remaining free neutrons to be fully reincorporated into the @xmath0-process .",
    "recent @xmath0-process models in this supersonic outflow scenario can reproduce the solar system abundances , but require an artificially high neutron - to - proton ratio @xcite .",
    "alternate wind solutions generated solely by magnetic fields or acoustic waves ,",
    "@xcite , also do not appear to produce a high enough neutron - to - seed ratio for an @xmath0-process .",
    "given these difficulties , alternative sites remain viable candidates , including neutron star mergers @xcite and gamma ray bursts @xcite .    in the neutrino - driven wind environment ,",
    "charged - current neutrino reactions on both nucleons and nuclei determine the neutron - to - seed ratio for the @xmath0-process .",

    "an analytic form of these neutrino - nucleon capture rates is found in @xcite .",
    "neutrino - nucleon reactions are responsible for the `` alpha '' effect , a critical detriment to the @xmath0-process in the presence of a high electron neutrino flux during the @xmath13-particle formation epoch @xcite .",
    "there have been several physical modifications proposed to reduce the efficacy of the `` alpha '' effect ; for instance , a fast outflow wind @xcite or active - sterile neutrino oscillations @xcite lead to a successful @xmath0-process .",
    "both mechanisms reduce the capture of free neutrons by electron neutrinos during the @xmath13-particle formation epoch , allowing for a successful @xmath0-process .    when classifying the neutron richness of the @xmath0-process , we employ the electron fraction : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the total neutron and proton number densities including both free nucleons and those in nuclei .",
    "the neutron - to - proton ratio may be taken as @xmath23 .",
    "environments with a low electron fraction have the high free neutron densities necessary to drive the rapid capture of neutrons onto seed nuclei , generating increasingly heavier nuclides by atomic weight , @xmath24 . during the @xmath0-process",

    "the union of rapid neutron capture and @xmath1-decay results in an abundance pattern distinguished by large peak features at @xmath26 , the first , second , and third peaks respectively .",
    "these peaks correspond to the closed shell nuclei with slow @xmath1-decay rates , creating `` waiting points '' , causing material to accumulate at these points .",
    "abundances of the second and third @xmath0-process peaks , and the intermediate nuclei between them , are defined by the nuclear properties of the @xmath0-process under conditions where both steady @xmath1-flow and fission cycling persist @xcite .",
    "fission cycling occurs for sufficiently neutron - rich conditions where the @xmath0-process extends to nuclides that can decay through fission channels .",
    "fission impacts the @xmath0-process by terminating the path near the trans - uranium region .",
    "this termination results in material returning to the @xmath7 peak @xcite .",
    "if neutron - rich conditions persist , these fission products effectively become new seed nuclei for the @xmath0-process , facilitating steady @xmath1-flow .",
    "once a sufficient supply of both neutrons and seed nuclei are available , steady-@xmath1 flow correlates the @xmath0-process abundances to their inverse @xmath1-decay rates , see _",
    "@xcite for further discussion .",
    "the individual abundances in @xmath27 along an isotopic chain are determined by ( n,@xmath28 ) @xmath29 ( @xmath28,n ) equilibrium .",
    "these correlated abundances span two or more of the closed - shell regions , and when occurring between the second , @xmath7 , and third , @xmath8 , @xmath0-process peaks , are a set of isotopic chains between @xmath6 . the @xmath25 of the last chain is determined by fission .",
    "the first and last chains are linked as material leaving the last chain becomes the seed nuclides for the first chain through fission cycling .",
    "the rate change of the total abundance of an isotopic chain , @xmath30 , is the difference between material entering and exiting the chain by @xmath1-decay , @xmath31 above , the individual abundances of an isotopic chain are @xmath32 , and the individual @xmath1-decay rates are @xmath33 .",
    "if both ( n,@xmath28 ) @xmath29 ( @xmath28,n ) equilibrium and re - population of the seed nuclei persist , the flow of material between isotopic chains reaches a steady - state configuration and the abundances and @xmath1-decay rates of each isotopic chain are inversely related as : @xmath34 this is known as the steady @xmath1-flow condition .",
    "here we examine fission cycling and steady-@xmath1 flow mechanisms and discuss their impact on the @xmath0-process in the neutrino - driven wind .",
    "we also explore changes to the neutrino physics , independent of a physical generator , that lead to environments where fission cycling and steady-@xmath1 flow mechanisms are present in the neutrino - driven wind . in section [ nwind ]",

    "the neutrino - driven wind forms several seconds post - core bounce in the core - collapse supernova environment , and a one - dimensional wind model is often employed to describe the abundance composition of the isotropic outflow @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional wind models have been employed previously ; however , these calculations do not self - consistently account for neutrino interactions , necessitating the use of an artificial @xmath35 @xcite . here",
    "we follow the same wind parameterization as @xcite .",

    "we track the abundance composition of a mass element , following ejection from the proton - neutron star , using three coupled reaction networks .",

    "nuclei that undergo fission provide a termination point for the @xmath0-process by preventing the production of heavier nuclides past this region .",
    "after the nuclide undergoes fission , it fragments into smaller nuclides that rejoin the @xmath0-process in the @xmath7 region .",
    "this leads to fission cycling , with the fission daughter products acting as seed nuclei for the @xmath0-process .    a knowledge of both the location of fission and the resultant distribution of fission fragments are necessary for detailed calculations of the @xmath0-process in very neutron - rich environments .",
    "treatments of fission in the @xmath0-process @xcite have been limited to largely phenomenological methods since there are few measurements of the fission properties for neutron - rich heavy nuclides .",
    "this current study is concerned with the general effects of fission on the @xmath0-process .",
    "we employ @xmath1-delayed fission probabilities from @xcite which are relevant to our mass model and astrophysical conditions .",
    "we indirectly include the effects of neutron - induced fission , as no complete and consistent set of neutron - induced rates is available , by employing a spontaneous fission region for @xmath45 , where all of the nuclides instantaneously fission , following previous treatments described in @xcite .",
    "we implement fission by depopulating the parent fission nuclide into its appropriate daughter nuclides at the end of each timestep in our network code .",
    "the effects of neutrino - induced fission are small and are not included @xcite .",

    "we treat the emitted neutrons as becoming immediately thermalized with the surrounding medium .",
    "as the fission material is re - incorporated in the @xmath7 peak , this material experiences `` waiting points '' and accumulates here as @xmath1-decay is necessary for material to move from one isotopic ( @xmath25 ) chain to the next ( @xmath46 ) chain .",
    "the material is initially compacted together in atomic mass space , @xmath24 , and then disperses through @xmath1-decay .",
