    "as the available database describing the global properties of individual galaxies has grown , it has become increasingly feasible to try to understand more about these systems by exploring correlations among several large - scale structural parameters .",
    "these global parameters often include : @xmath6(bulge velocity dispersion ) , @xmath9(bulge mass as calculated through the virial theorem or its variants ) , @xmath10(effective radius ) , @xmath11(mean surface brightness ) , luminosity , and more recently @xmath5(mass of the central supermassive black hole ) .",
    "one of the earliest demonstrations of such correlations was the work of @xcite who used a sample of 260 systems to show that early - type galaxies form a two - parameter family characterized by velocity dispersion and mean surface brightness , introducing the concept of a fundamental plane for galaxies .",
    "correlations with @xmath5 properties were first constructed by @xcite ( 8 galaxies ) and @xcite ( 36 galaxies ) . since then , @xcite and @xcite demonstrated a correlation between @xmath5and @xmath2 , which appeared to have lower dispersion than the relation between @xmath5and the luminosity of the galactic bulge or other parameters .",
    "however , the slopes of the @xmath1- @xmath6relation derived by these two groups were significantly different and the debate on this point continues energetically today ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* to cite a few ) .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed links among a galaxy s globular cluster system ( gcs ) , total halo mass , and smbh mass . from a sample of 13 galaxies , @xcite ( hereafter bt ) also showed that @xmath5is almost directly proportional to the total globular cluster population of a galaxy , @xmath0 . at first glance the statement that @xmath4@xmath12 @xmath5should not be thought of as",
    "terribly surprising , since both @xmath4and @xmath5are known to be related to other galaxy properties such as mass and luminosity ( see especially @xcite ( hereafter hha13 ) for a recent comprehensive discussion of gc populations and systematics ) ; essentially , larger galaxies should on average have more massive smbhs and more globular clusters . but more interesting , and possibly more important for understanding early galaxy evolution , is the suggestion that the _ scatter _ in the @xmath5- @xmath4correlation is remarkably small , comparable with or even lower than what has been claimed for @xmath5vs .",
    "the low scatter is harder to explain by trivial scaling arguments , and is what makes this newly - found correlation intriguing .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter hh ) confirmed the findings of @xcite and bt from a much larger sample of 33 galaxies with well determined @xmath4and @xmath1   values .",
    "they found , as did bt but with stronger confidence , that @xmath5scales nearly linearly with @xmath4(@xmath5@xmath12 @xmath4@xmath13 ) and also drew attention to a number of other issues :    * occasional genuine outliers that fall well off the central @xmath4- @xmath5relation can not be explained by measurement uncertainties in either quantity .",
    "most notably , the milky way and ngc 5128 are both strong outliers in the sense that they have too - small smbh s for their number of gcs , though both quantities are well determined . * the residual scatter around the mean relation @xmath5@xmath12 @xmath4is very noticeably larger than expected from the random measurement uncertainties quoted in the literature , suggesting that the scatter is dominated by a real cosmic variance . *",
    "the spiral galaxies ( with the exception of the milky way ) follow the e - galaxy relation quite closely .",
    "by contrast , the s0 galaxies in the list show much larger scatter and no well defined slope ; for them , the basic e / s relation `` appears to be irrelevant '' .",
    "additional recent discussions of the correlations between the gcs and the smbh have been published by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue essentially that the relatively low scatter in @xmath5- @xmath4can be interpreted by seeing both quantities as linked to ( and perhaps determined by ) the galaxy s bulge mass . @xcite",
    "extend the discussion to propose a correlation between @xmath5and the velocity dispersion _ of the globular cluster system _",
    ", @xmath14 ; at present , this interesting relation can be built on only 13 large galaxies with available gcs velocity data .",
    "@xcite selected 20 galaxies ( 10e , 8s0 , and 2s ) with particularly complete , homogeneous gcs data and found @xmath5@xmath12 @xmath4@xmath15 , a @xmath16% steeper slope than in hh .",
    "the steeper slope seems primarily to be due to her use of only large galaxies in the fit ( essentially milky - way - sized and larger ) , whereas hh used galaxies over the entire existing luminosity range , including dwarfs .",
    "hh also include two very luminous e s , m87 and ngc 5846 , that rhode does not .",
    "these extreme cases at the top end and bottom end of the correlation make up only a minority of the total sample but they exert strong leverage over the fit .",
    "it is not out of the question that with much more , and more precise , data in hand the @xmath4- @xmath5relation might appear slightly nonlinear .",
    "notably , @xcite also finds that the slope does not change significantly if the gc sample is subdivided into its blue ( metal - poor ) and red ( metal - richer ) subpopulations , a step that can be done only for high - quality gcs photometry in which the division between red and blue can be clearly made . as in hh",
    ", she also found that the s0 and disk galaxies in this selected sample showed larger scatter than the e s ( though still based on a very small sample ) .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the various correlations of these global parameters for a still larger sample of galaxies , paying the closest attention to four of the ones listed above : @xmath1 , @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "we find that the relation with the smallest scatter of all is the one between @xmath4and the dynamical bulge mass , @xmath3 , and suggest a possible evolutionary link between them .",
    "we have two additional objectives .",
    "first , we directly compare best - fit solutions from a conventional @xmath17minimization procedure , with ones obtained from a mcmc ( monte carlo markov chain ) technique .",
    "second , we discuss the residual scatters around these solutions in an attempt to decide whether or not we have already resolved the intrinsic ( cosmic ) scatter in the parameters .",
    "the smbh of a galaxy is a structural feature with a typical size of a few au , whereas the gcs spans tens to hundreds of kiloparsecs , a factor of @xmath18 bigger in scale size .",
    "so a _ causal _ link between the smbh and the globular cluster population may therefore seem quite unlikely .",
    "but the possibility should not simply be dismissed out of hand .",
    "hh pointed out that both the smbh and gcs have their origins in the same earliest phases of galaxy formation at @xmath19 .",
    "there is a rich literature on how smbh - driven agn activity can strongly influence star formation in large galaxies through either negative or positive feedback , particularly in the high - redshift stages when the most gas is present @xcite . to cite only a few recent examples , @xcite present models of agn jets interacting with a fractal - like ism in the central kpc .",
    "these show that a high fraction of the jet energy is transferred to the gas , and also that the jet can quickly ( @xmath20 y ) penetrate through the central bulge out into the halo regions by channeling through the intercloud regions .",
    "lower - density regions of the gas are ablated and heated by the jet , but the densest gas cores ( among which would be protoglobular clusters ) are preserved .",
    "in addition , the star formation rate outside the central region will be enhanced through agn ram compression @xcite .",
    "once the powerful jet penetrates into the halo , its energy can be deposited and percolated over many - kiloparsec scales within a few @xmath21 years , an appropriate time period for the formation of the first gcs .    on the observational side , agn- or qso - driven star formation in galaxies at @xmath22 seems able to occur in sites many tens of kpc from the galaxy center ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among many others ) .",
    "most of the discussions on jet - influenced star formation so far have concentrated on the global properties of their host galaxies .",
    "it remains to be seen whether or not gc formation can be either inhibited or enhanced relative to field - star formation by agn activity .    an opposite approach , that gcs can _ build _ or at least enlarge the central smbh , has been promoted in other recent papers ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for comprehensive discussions ) .",
    "the essential idea is that gcs in the inner region of a galaxy can be disrupted by dynamical friction over a timescale short enough to add significantly to the stellar population of the central bulge @xcite and thus , perhaps , to the central black hole as well .",
    "their quantitative estimates are based on the assumption that the radial distribution of gcs in the galaxy was initially the same as the distribution of field - star light , and that it is now flatter in the central regions because gcs there were destroyed . under this assumption",
    "typically 30 - 50% of the original gc population may have been lost this way . plotting smbh mass versus the _ calculated _ mass from the supposedly `` lost '' clusters then shows a very rough positive correlation @xcite .",
    "significant difficulties confront this interpretation .",
    "it invokes a large number of long - vanished ( and massive ) gcs , and to make a major contribution to the smbh growth , very large numbers of stars from the disrupted gcs would have to find their way into a tiny , au - sized central black hole rather than just joining the bulge stellar population .",
    "another traditional objection to such a picture is that the innermost bulge population is generally much more metal - rich ( reaching solar or higher ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than all but a few individual gcs ( which mostly range from 1/3 to 1/200 solar ) , so only a small fraction of the bulge can have been built by cluster disruption .",
    "furthermore , there is no evidence that even the most massive gcs in existence ( @xmath23 and above ) are sufficiently metal - rich to match the inner bulge population @xcite .",
    "yet another approach would be to assume that intermediate - mass bhs already residing in the gcs could combine to add to the galaxy s smbh .",
    "little is known about the presence or actual masses of imbhs though they have been proposed as seeds for smbh formation ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * for a recent discussion ) .",
    "one of the best observational cases for an imbh is in @xmath24 centauri , for which plausible evidence exists that an imbh of 50,000 @xmath25 is present @xcite . if we suppose that ( a ) all gcs contain imbhs , ( b ) their imbh mass is directly proportional to cluster mass with a mass ratio of 2% like @xmath24 cen , and ( c ) all the imbhs in the disrupted gcs add to the central smbh , then on the average 1000 gcs ( a typical value for a moderately large elliptical ) could add @xmath26 to the smbh .",
    "all of these assumptions are arbitrary , and in any case this added mass is only a few percent of the typical @xmath27 smbh mass for the same type of galaxy ( see below ) .",
    "recently , @xcite explored the very different possibility , suggested by @xcite , that the origin of the @xmath5- @xmath28 ( equivalent to our @xmath3 ) relation results from a statistical convergence process rather than a causal , physical one .",
    "they used numerical simulations and merger trees to demonstrate that hierarchical galaxy formation leads to a linear relation between smbh and bulge mass even if their initial distributions were strongly uncorrelated .",
    "the initial @xmath5- @xmath28 correlation they derived from this simple assumption was , however , much tighter than is observed and had a different slope . by adding other features to their simulations ( including star formation , black hole accretion , and disk to bulge mass conversion ) they produced correlations much more similar to observed data and concluded that the relation `` is produced naturally by the merger - driven assembly of bulge and bh mass , and without any coupling of sf and bh mass growth per individual galaxy '' .",
    "our conclusion for the present is that the likeliest chance to establish a causal link between the gcs and smbh ( if there is one ) would be through agn feedback and its influence on star and gc formation .",
    "much ground remains to be explored in this direction through modelling .",
    "the possibility of a noncausal , statistical origin also remains competitive .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table 3 ( classic @xmath8 minimization ) should be compared with table 4 ( mcmc fits ) .",
    "the differences in the @xmath29 values are due simply to adoption of different zeropoint scalings .",
    "the more important comparison between the deduced slopes @xmath30 reveals mutual agreement to within the combined uncertainties for most of the parameter pairs .",
    "given the level of total scatter in all the relations , and the limitations in the still - small sample of galaxies , we suggest that the mcmc uncertainties on the slopes are likely to be the more realistic of the two methods . the largest discrepancy is nominally for @xmath4-",
    "@xmath2(slope 4.86 from table 3 , 6.11 from table 4 ) , but since the combined uncertainty is also large ( @xmath31 ) the difference does not stand out especially when we also consider the presence of some individual outliers and the fact that the relation is intrinsically nonlinear ( see again hha13 ) .",
    "the correlation for @xmath5- @xmath4yielded a noticeably flatter slope from mcmc ( @xmath32 ) than from @xmath17minimization ( @xmath33 ) , apparently because mcmc was less influenced by the dwarf - galaxy points appearing at the lower left of the graph .",
    "the message we take from these comparisons is that there is no evidence at the present time to reject the view that @xmath5and @xmath4are rather closely directly proportional to one another .",
    "both of these , in turn , scale almost exactly as @xmath3 .",
    "we have taken advantage of recent compilations of global parameters for galaxies in which the mass of the central black hole has been determined , and have combined these with a recent compilation of all galaxies with known globular cluster populations .",
    "we now find a sample of 49 galaxies which can be used to explore the @xmath5- @xmath4correlation that has attracted recent interest .",
    "for this set of galaxies we also have values of @xmath10and @xmath6which can be used to examine correlations of @xmath5and @xmath4with @xmath6and @xmath3 .    examining the raw data in detail , we find that particularly for @xmath10and @xmath6 , wide ranges of values for a given galaxy are often quoted in the literature that make it difficult to select best measurements . for these parameters we chose to use the values from the @xmath5determinations as an attempt at consistency .",
    "all parameters were renormalized ( where appropriate ) to the @xcite sbf galaxy distance catalogue as it contained virtually all of the galaxies in our sample and introduced no systematic biases within the quoted errors .    with the data available , we have solved for correlations among the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath9using both @xmath8 minimization and monte carlo markov chain techniques .",
    "* all the 2-parameter correlations show total scatters around the best - fit relations of @xmath34 in the log .",
    "both @xmath4and @xmath5follow tight and nearly linear relations particularly with @xmath9(bulge mass ) . among all parameter pairs ,",
    "the single relation with the lowest absolute scatter is @xmath4versus @xmath3 ; these two quantities scale accurately in direct proportion , a result that we have also found from much larger galaxy samples ( hha13 ) .",
    "* one of our strongest findings is that in both fitting methods we must introduce additional variance @xmath35 over and above the formal measurement uncertainties in order to obtain statistically valid solutions . to varying degrees",
    "these additional variances are needed in every one of the 4 parameters we use .",
    "the clear implication is that either the galaxy parameters have significant ` cosmic scatter ' , or ( perhaps less likely ) that the observational measurement uncertainties have been significantly underestimated . by using all of the 2-parameter correlations that are obtainable from the data , we find a self - consistent set of _ extra variances _ ( in log scale ) given by @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath5values show the largest extra variance . as mentioned above",
    ", the need for additional variation in the correlation solutions is not new ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite among others ) .",
    "what is new here is that the additional variance is required in all four parameters . for comparison",
    "we determined average measurement uncertainties for @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and @xmath4based on the data in table 1 . in this exercise",
    "we excluded the galaxies m32 , ngc 4486a , and ngc 4486b ( which were commonly left out of the correlation solutions ) as well as ngc4374 and a2052 for which the quoted values of @xmath5were upper limits only .",
    "we used @xmath37 = 0.1as discussed in section 3.6 .",
    "the variances for each parameter , based only on the quoted observational errors , are then @xmath38 in the log . in all cases",
    "( except for @xmath39 ) , the _ extra _ variance required is more than twice the nominal observed values . * the correlations involving @xmath5have slopes that are more sensitive to the addition of @xmath35 s than those involving @xmath0 ; the additional variance increases the relative importance of the smaller galaxies to the fit and ends up flattening all the slopes . *",
    "the correlation of @xmath4against @xmath6is poorly constrained and ( based on solutions from larger samples ) more strongly nonlinear than the other parameter pairs .    at this stage of development , we suggest that the best observational route to exploring the @xmath4- @xmath5correlation further will be to reduce sample bias by adding more galaxies at lower luminosity , but especially by adding more s and s0 galaxies ; at present , the e galaxies dominate the still - limited sample of galaxies in which both @xmath4and @xmath5are accurately measured .",
    "the point of exploring these and other correlations among galaxy parameters is to gain an understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "all these parameters arise from the original mass concentration and gravitational potential well from which each galaxy formed . but each parameter examined here ( as well as those such as galaxy luminosity , mass and halo mass among others ) has evolved with time and in different ways , changing the interrelations as well .",
    "for instance , @xmath5is expected to increase as gas and stars surrounding the galaxy centre are accreted and , in many cases this process is ongoing today .",
    "contrarily @xmath4will decrease with time as clusters are disrupted by both internal and external effects ; but , in contrast to @xmath1 , most of the change in @xmath4is expected to have happened within the first @xmath40 years after formation .",
    "@xmath4evolution is more smoothly predictable and due to the overall tidal field while @xmath5evolution is more stochastic and can differ even between similar galaxies due to local differences in gas - rich merger histories . thus , it is not surprising that @xmath5 relations have greater scatter than those involving @xmath0 .",
    "the physical scales at work are very different as well , from @xmath41pc for the central black hole to @xmath42pc for the globular cluster system . since it is likely that most or all galaxy properties have changed over the past @xmath43 years , then the nature of the various correlations today ( their slope , linearity or curvature , and dispersion ) will reflect _ both _ initial conditions and evolution to some degree .",
    "lastly , our results suggest that the dispersions observed in the various correlations are significantly affected by the individual evolutionary histories of the galaxies and can not be explained by saying that the quoted uncertainties for the many galaxy properties are too small .",
    "we therefore favor the interpretation that the extra variances , @xmath35 , introduced by both the reduced @xmath8 and mcmc analyses are more likely to be reasonable estimates of the cosmic scatter .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the two micron all - sky survey which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",

    "<S> we explore several correlations between various large - scale galaxy properties , particularly total globular cluster population ( @xmath0 ) , the central black hole mass ( @xmath1 ) , velocity dispersion ( nominally @xmath2 ) , and bulge mass ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our data sample of 49 galaxies , for which both @xmath4and @xmath5are known , is larger than used in previous discussions of these two parameters and we employ the same sample to explore all pairs of correlations . </S>",
    "<S> further , within this galaxy sample we investigate the scatter in each quantity , with emphasis on the range of published values for @xmath6and effective radius ( @xmath7 ) for any one galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these two quantities in particular are difficult to measure consistently and caution that precise intercomparison of galaxy properties involving @xmath7and @xmath2is particularly difficult .    </S>",
    "<S> using both conventional @xmath8 minimization and monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) fitting techniques , we show that quoted observational uncertainties for all parameters are too small to represent the true scatter in the data . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the correlation between @xmath9and @xmath4is stronger than either the @xmath5- @xmath6or the @xmath5- @xmath4relations . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this is because both the galaxy bulge population and @xmath4were fundamentally established at an early epoch during the same series of star - forming events . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , although the seed for @xmath5was likely formed at a similar epoch , its growth over time is less similar from galaxy to galaxy and thus less predictable .    </S>",
