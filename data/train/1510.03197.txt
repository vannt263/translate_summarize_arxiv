    "the recurrent black hole binary gs  2023 + 338(= ) went into outburst on june 15th , 2015 after 26 years of quietness .",
    "a sudden increase of accretion rate was initially detected with the _ swift _ satellite @xcite and reported also by _",
    "soon after these notifications , many ground and space facilities have been following the event .",
    "thanks to its exceptionally bright flux ,   represents an excellent test laboratory at high energies , where it is possible to unveal the properties of the central engine thanks to the reduced absorption effect .",
    "was detected for the first time in x - ray with the _ ginga _ satellite in 1989 , may 19 @xcite and then observed with instruments on board the _ roentgen _ observatory on mir - kvant for more than 2 months @xcite .",
    "the authors reported on the emission spectra in the 2 - 300 kev band at different epochs and different flux levels , with evidence of variability of the soft part ( e@xmath515 kev ) .",
    "the source behaviour was also followed up in optical and the system identified with @xcite , while use of archival optical data allowed the discovery of two outbursts in 1938 and 1956 .",
    "the extensive monitoring of the source allowed the determination of the key parameters of the system , having a mass function of 6.08@xmath60.06 @xcite .",
    "the compact object is a @xmath7 black hole with an orbital period of 6.5 days and a @xmath8 k0iv companion @xcite .",
    "the best distance estimate is @xmath9  kpc @xcite .",
    "this source has been the best studied quiescent system being also the most luminous stellar black hole in this state @xcite . a spectral energy distribution with simultaneous coverage at x , uv , optical and radio has been compiled , revealing an ir excess , originated from either a cold disk or a jet @xcite .",
    "the x - ray data from two epochs indicated a power law continuum with index @xmath10 , with no indication of spectral variability in spite of a factor 10 variation in luminosity .",
    "the radio data is consistent with a flat spectrum , resembling the typical x - ray binaries hard state and associated with a compact jet ; the radio variability is not correlated with x - ray variability .",
    "on june 17th , 2015 a public _ integral _ target of opportunity ( too ) program started and we here report on the preliminary analysis of the collected data .",
    "v404 cyg has been monitored at high energies by _ integral _ and other space facilities by dedicated too programs @xcite .",
    "an initial , extended phase with intense flaring and large , short term variations in hardness ( down to a few seconds time scales ) occurred , with the source reaching luminosities up @xmath11  erg  s@xmath12 .",
    "most instruments sensitive in the x - ray band were saturated by such a high flux , see e.g. @xcite . the peak intensity during  5 days of activity reached 44 crab on mjd 57194.31 as detected by _ integral _ @xcite .",
    "_ integral _ monitored the source quite continuously since june 17th , with short ( @xmath0  half a day ) interruptions due to operational constraints ( mostly , scheduled for each perigee passage ) . around june 28th",
    ", the source had much faded @xcite but remained visible at a level of a few mcrab intensity in the hard x - rays @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the spectral evolution of   during the intense initial flaring .",
    "we use _ integral _ observations performed during revolution 1554 , starting at mjd  57190.896 with a total elapsed time of 50.55 hours .",
    "this period is coincident with the starting phase of the _ integral _ monitoring .",
    "the ibis / isgri data for this observation are near real - time data processed using the latest release of the _ integral _ offline scientific analysis ( osa  v10.1 ) .",
    "this software has been used to obtain light curves and spectra in different common time intervals .",
    "spi data are taken from the consolidated data archive , whereas their analysis makes use of specific tools developed at irap @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the hard x - ray emission from the source is shown in figure  1 . the hardness ratio (",
    "hereafter , hr ) during the most turbulent phases varies on time scales down to at least a few seconds . in figure 2",
    "the intensity and hardness profiles are shown for the science window ( hereafter , scw ) no.43 , where the source flux reached its maximum within our observing period .",
    "for the purpose of spectral analysis , we divided the time profile of the major flare into time intervals 100s long , as shown in figure  2 , and built a total of six spectra by grouping the ones with similar hr and fluxes .",
    "in particular , we group spectra if their flux difference is @xmath13% and the difference in hr is @xmath14 .",
    "together with the low state spectrum of period a this results in a set of seven spectra , a to g. for ibis / isgri , the range 13 - 1000  kev was sampled using 85 channels with variable width , chosen according to a logarithmic law .",
    "we restricted the analysis to the range 25 - 300 kev , for which there exists an accurate response .",
    "the overall dependence of source hardness on hard x - ray flux is shown in figure  3 . the distribution of values , when represented as the ( normalized ) difference of count rates in the 50 - 100 and 25 - 50 kev bands , reproduces the shape of a horse head .",
    "it is interesting to note that , while at low fluxes ( below @xmath15  crab ) the hardness is varying on a wide scale , it is more stable at intermediate fluxes with a weak trend of being correlated with flux up to intensities below @xmath10  crab . at higher fluxes , corresponding to the brightest flaring episodes , the hardness seems to be anticorrelated with flux .",
    "however , within a single x - ray flare , harder spectra may occur at higher fluxes , as it holds for the green points corresponding to the data for the brightest flare , occurred within scw 43 ( intervals b to g ) .",
    "if this is the case , the anticorrelation hr - flux could hold for peak fluxes of different flare episodes and not during a single flare ( see also figure  4 ) .",
    "the ibis / isgri data are affected by gaps due to limited telemetry bandwidth .",
    "the length of such gaps is of the order of a few seconds and their rate is slightly variable , being correlated with source intensity ; due to this , the software actually reconstructs only a limited portion of spectral information for some of the 100s long spectra . for this reason we have been able to obtain a good match for ibis and spi data ( i.e. same live time intervals ) only for the periods a",
    ", f and g.    the spectra shown in figure  4 describe the evolution of the source emission during the low state period ( a ) and the flare of scw  43 ( b to g ) , as derived with ibis / isgri and spi .",
    "ibis and spi source fluxes have been generally found in good agreement ( @xmath16 ) , despite the strong source variability and the non - homogeneous data taking intervals for the two instruments .",
    "furthermore we found that , at high flux levels , the ibis / isgri spectra appear systematically harder than spi ones , yielding a difference in spectral index lower than @xmath17% .",
    "the reasons for this are under investigation ; however , we have verified that the induced systematic effect on the spectral parameters is very small when fitting with physically motivated models .    the low state spectrum measured for period",
    "a ( see figure  1 ) has been analyzed by performing a joint fit with both instruments .",
    "it can be modeled by a simple power law with photon index @xmath18 , with a lower limit for the high energy cutoff of @xmath19  kev .",
    "the average flux is @xmath20 erg @xmath21 s@xmath12 in the 25 - 400  kev band , corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath22 erg s@xmath12 .",
    "the two instruments cross - normalization is @xmath23 .",
    "the spectra during the main flare ( b to g ) show a prominent high energy cutoff . a thermal comptonization model , _ comptt _ in xspec , provides a satisfactory description of the data ( see table  1 ) . for the highest fluxes , b to e ,",
    "the temperature of the accreting plasma is quite constant around @xmath24  kev .",
    "after some flux decline ( spectrum f ) the electron temperature increases up to @xmath25  kev and the optical depth decreases ( @xmath26 ) . in all cases , the temperature of the seed photons for the comptonization is high , around @xmath27  kev .",
    "we have verified that a model spectrum with a seed photon temperature of between 0.1 and 2  kev , typical of the thermal blackbody emission from an accretion disk , can not reproduce the data within the thermal comptonization model . forcing the seed temperature to such low values",
    ", the fit requires a second additive component , which can not be accounted by reflection : in this case , modeling the spectra with a single direct continuum with reflection yields excessively high values of the reflection normalization , as we verified using both the _ pexriv / pexrav _ @xcite and _ xillver _ @xcite models .",
    "conversely , if we adopt the single component model reported in table  1 , the use of reflection does not improve the fit results , with the exception of spectrum c , for which fitting the data with an added _ xillver _ component yields a significantly better result ( @xmath28 instead of 1.41 ) . in this case",
    ", the fraction of reflected flux is found to be @xmath29% .    concerning our detection of the @xmath27  kev soft component , we considered effects that could modify the shape of the spectrum at the lowest energies , like partial covering of the central x - ray source .",
    "@xcite reported about two soft x - ray observations with _",
    "chandra _ taken on june 22 and 23 , when   was still active with average 2 - 10  kev fluxes of @xmath30 erg @xmath21 s@xmath12 and @xmath31 erg @xmath21 s@xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the detection of strong narrow emission lines led the authors to conclude that the central source is obscured , with evidence for the line formation region to be located at distances greater than @xmath32  cm , possibly coincident with the outer disk .",
    "motivated by this result we used a partial covering absorber ( _ pcfabs _ ) to model our flare spectra ( b to g ) , in conjunction with the usual _ comptt _ component .",
    "as expected , we obtain very large errors in the parameters characterizing the low energy spectrum , i.e. the covering fraction @xmath33 , the related absorption column , @xmath34 , and the seed temperature @xmath35 . nevertheless , if we impose values of @xmath35 lower than 2 kev in these fits , the @xmath34 values are always far too high , i.e. typically between @xmath36  @xmath21 and @xmath37  @xmath21 for values of @xmath33 from 0.20 to unity .",
    "we conclude that the partial covering of the source does not affect our main result about the observed high temperature of the seed photon spectrum .    finally , fitting the ibis / isgri data with the hybrid thermal / non - thermal comptonization model _",
    "@xcite also yields good results : @xmath38/dof=48.6/37 and 25.9/37 for spectrum  c and spectrum f , respectively .",
    "spectrum  c requires high values of the reflection normalization ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the temperature of the seed photon distribution for the above fits is @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively , essentially in good agreement with the _ comptt _ model .",

    "is an established transient black hole binary , for which two bright outbursts have been available for study in the hard x - rays .",
    "on the basis of its behaviour in the previous 1989 outburst , it had been proposed @xcite to belong to a class of transient sources for which the spectral state is quite independent on luminosity .",
    "figure  3 confirms this picture as a general trend also for this most recent event , at least for source luminosities above @xmath78  erg  s@xmath12 .",
    "one of the questions concerns the origin of the x - ray variability , i.e. is this related to rapid changes in the accretion flow , to a variable component from a jet , or both ? from the hard x - ray data we can exclude that the variability is totally due to absorption by a disk outflow or wind .",
    "whereas in the soft x - rays the central source could be partially or totally obscured @xcite , using the hard x - rays we are unveiling the variability component of the central accreting region , as proven by the rapid and large intensity fluctuations detected at energies up to @xmath25  kev .    during the current outburst of",
    ", we observed that the spectrum of the main flare is actually described by comptonization of a thermal plasma .",
    "the size of the corona can be estimated following the approach of @xcite using our measured parameters of temperature , accretion rate , luminosity and optical depth .",
    "if the energy of the corona is purely thermal , its size would be of the order of @xmath79 schwarzchild radii ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "conversely , if the stored energy is mainly present as a magnetic field the size would be of the order of a few @xmath80 .",
    "such a compact corona could explain , in our case , the almost constant plasma temperature of @xmath24  kev which is observed in all high flux spectra of the main flare .",
    "this scenario could also favor the possibility that the seed photons are not injected by the accretion disk , but have different origin as imposed by their high temperature of @xmath27  kev .",
    "the seed photons could be provided by a moderately optically thick synchrotron source within the jet , giving rise to a self - absorbed spectrum .",
    "this radiation would be then upscattered by the surrounding hot corona . for reference ,",
    "a scenario with synchrotron generated seed photons has been discussed by @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that our spectral results are not affected by instrumental effects due to the exceptionally high count rate from .",
    "in fact , they are in agreement with the spectral analysis reported by @xcite using the spi data for the same observations . the spi and ibis / isgri detectors are based on completely different technology and are cross - calibrated in - flight using the crab nebula as reference source .",
    "we have analyzed _ integral _ data from the initial phase ( first pointing with _ integral _ ) of the recent outburst .",
    "the source features high flux variability and hard spectra even in the brightest flares , with evidence for a thermally comptonized spectrum with a plasma temperature of @xmath24  kev . despite the spectral parameters of the analysis",
    "must be taken with caution due the intrinsic limitations of the models , there is indication for a seed photon component not coincident with the hot accretion disk thermal photons .    by means of this study we characterize the high energy behaviour of the source at the highest fluxes , where the hardness during single flares is correlated with flux ( see figure 4 ) up to luminosities of a few percent of eddington , and anti - correlated at higher fluxes .",
