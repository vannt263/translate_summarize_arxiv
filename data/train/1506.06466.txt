    "quasi - static transformations are defined in thermodynamic literature as those transformations where the external conditions change so slowly that at any moment the system is _ approximately _ in equilibrium .",
    "they are usually presented as idealization of _ real _ thermodynamic transformations @xcite . on the other hand",
    "they are necessary , in the traditional approach , in order to construct thermodynamic potentials , for example to define thermodynamic entropy from carnot cycles .",
    "equilibrium statistical mechanics succesfully describes the equilibrium thermodynamics states from the microscopic dynamical properties of the system , in particular the corresponding stationary probability distributions , given explicitely by the gibbs measures .",
    "let us consider the simple situation when the internal dynamics of the system has a certain number of conserved quantities ( energy , density , ... ) , and the external conditions ( temperature of the heat bath , pressure of the external forces , ... ) select the stationary equilibrium probability distribution for the microscopic dynamics .",
    "the fact that , when the microscopic system is _ large _ , there are only few of such conserved quantities , and correspondingly few external parameters will determine the equilibrium state , is related to the ergodicity of the microscopic dynamics .",
    "the system can be driven out of equilibrium by changing the exterior parameters .",
    "if this is done abruptly , eventually the system will relax to a new equilibrium state corresponding to the new values of temperature , pressure etc .. the typical relaxation time to equilibrium may depend on the size of the microscopic system .",
    "the situation is similar but more complex when the external agents are space inhomogeneous , for example when the system is submitted to gradients of temperature or pressure . in the stationary situation",
    "fluxes of the conserved quantities can cross the system .",
    "the corresponding probability stationary distributions for the microscopic dynamics are called _ non - equilibrium stationary states_. these are not explicitly computable as in the equilibrium case , but are locally close to the equilibrium ones , when the size of the system is very large .    in the present article",
    "we want to obtain , at least for some systems , in a rigorous way the quasi - static thermodynamic transformations from the microscopic dynamics , through a space - time scale limit . in systems of size @xmath0 with diffusive behavior , where the typical time scale for reaching equilibrium is of order @xmath1 , we look at the evolution of the conserved quantities at the time scale @xmath2 , for a @xmath3 , and we change the exterior conditions smoothly at this time scale ( i.e. very slowly with respect to the typical relaxation time ) .",
    "we obtain that in this time scale , at each instant @xmath4 , the profile of the conserved quantities converges to the deterministic profiles corresponding to the stationary state for the boundary condition given at time @xmath4 .",
    "this means that the profiles evolve quasi - statically , following the rules of the thermodynamic quasi - static transformations .",
    "consequently the _ paradox _ of the quasi - static transformations disappears when these transformations are understood ( also in a mathematically precise way ) in a proper macroscopic space - time scale .",
    "remarkably we also obtain quasi - static transformations between _ non - equilibrium stationary states _ , that could be the base for constructing a thermodynamics of non - equilibrium .",
    "we consider three different models , in order to illustrate the generality of the idea .",
    "we consider first the symmetric simple exclusion in an interval of size @xmath0 , i.e. particles performing symmetric random walks with exclusion rule , with density reservoirs at the boundaries .",
    "these reservoirs are realized with random creation and annhiliation of particles so that the average density of particles at the boundaries will be respectively @xmath5 on the left and @xmath6 on the right .",
    "the rate of jumps or of creations / annhiliation is @xmath7 , @xmath8 being any positive number .",
    "we prove that at every time @xmath4 the empirical particle s density converges , as @xmath9 , to the linear interpolation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , i.e. to the solution of the laplace equation @xmath10 with the given boundary conditions .",
    "we actually prove the strongest result of the local equilibrium property .",
    "we first prove the above convergence in section [ sec : simple - excl - with ] by using duality techniques as in @xcite , where analogous results were proved in the case of @xmath11 fixed constants . with the duality techniques we prove local equilibrium in the strong form of theorem [ thm1 ] and the same techniques allow to study the limit of the covariance function .",
    "in fact we prove in theorem [ a3.2 ] that the covariance behaves at each time @xmath4 as in the corresponding stationary states    , as first computed by spohn @xcite .    in section [ sec : entropy - method ] , see theorem [ leex ]",
    ", we prove a weaker version of the local equilibrium by using entropy methods as in @xcite and @xcite that are suitable to be used for more general models .",
    "in particular the proof of theorem [ leex ] can be adapted to prove the analogous statement for all gradient conservative dynamics with creations / annihilations at the boundaries as the ones studied in @xcite in the case of constants @xmath11 .",
    "in section [ sec : zero - range ] we consider the zero - range process , where more particles per site are allowed , and jump symmetrically with rate depending on the number of particles in the site they occupy .",
    "a chemical potential @xmath12 characterizes the equilibrium measures , which is the expectation of the jump rate , and in general is a non - linear function of the density . at the boundaries",
    "the reservoirs are given again by creations / annihilations of particles corresponding to two possibly different values of @xmath13 at time @xmath4 .",
    "jumps and creations / annihilations happen at rate proportional to @xmath7 , and we prove that at each macroscopic time @xmath4 ( in a weak sense ) the empirical density of the particles converges to the solution of the non - linear laplace equation @xmath14    finally , in section [ sec : damp - anharm - chain ] , we consider a chain of ( unpinned ) anharmonic oscillators in contact with a heat bath with a gradient of temperature and subject to a force ( tension ) @xmath15 acting on the last right particle , that changes at the macroscopic time scale",
    ". the left end of the chain is attached to a point and the heat bath is modeled by langevin thermostats acting on each particles .",
    "the temperatures of the langevin thermostats may depend on the atom and change slowly form one atom to the neighbor one , giving rise to a smooth macroscopic profile of temperature .",
    "when temperature profile @xmath16 is constant in space and time at a value @xmath17 and tension is constant @xmath18 , the stationary ( equilibrium ) distribution is given by the canonical gibbs measure with these values of temperaure and tension . in equilibrium",
    "the tension @xmath19 is equal to the expectation value of the anharmonic force between particles .    for a non - constant profile of temperature",
    "we have a non - equilibrium stationary state where energy flows from hot to cold thermostats .",
    "we consider only situations where the profile of temperature does not change in time , and only the applied tension is changing in the macroscopic time scale .",
    "again the dynamics is speeded up in time by @xmath7 .",
    "we prove that the empirical strain of volume converge to the solution of the equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the equilibrium tension corresponding to the volume ( lenght ) @xmath22 and temperature @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the thermodynamic free energy .",
    "we have obtained this way the quasi - static isothermal transformation .",
    "the main interest in this last model is that we can define the heat @xmath25 as the limit of the the total flux of energy between the system and the thermostats , divided by the number of particles , and it turns out that this is a * deterministic * function of time that satisfy @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the limit of the internal energy ( per particle ) and @xmath28 is the work done by the exterior force . in the context of the equilibrium case ( constant temperature profile ) , this is the first principle of thermodynamics for isothermal quasi - static transformations . for non - constant temperature profile @xmath25",
    "is usually called _ excess heat_.",
    "also this quasi - static transformation satisfies clausius identity , i.e. the work @xmath28 is equal to the time difference of the free energy after properly identifying the macroscopic free energy as integral over space of the equilibrium one .",
    "quasi - static limits where previously considered on the macroscopic hydrodynamic diffusive equation , rescaling the boundaries parameters after having performed the hydrodynamic limits ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , i.e. in a two step approach .",
    "the point of this article is to show that quasi - static transformations can be obtained in a straightforward way from the microscopic dynamics by considering the proper space - time scaling .",
    "we consider the exclusion process in @xmath29 , @xmath30 with reservoirs at the boundaries with density @xmath31 .",
    "we assume that @xmath32 are lipschitz continuous .",
    "presumably our results can be generalized to piecewise continuous functions but we did not investigate this case .    denoting by @xmath33 the occupation number at @xmath34 we define the dynamics via the generator @xmath35,\\qquad t\\ge 0,\\quad \\alpha>0\\ ] ] where @xmath36 @xmath37 is the configuration obtained from @xmath38 by exchanging the occupation numbers at @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and @xmath41   \\label{eq:1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 , and @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",

    "we prove theorem [ thm1 ] by using the self - duality of the exclusion that can be adapted to our process as we explain in propositions [ prop1.1 ] and [ prop1.2 ] below .",
    "the dual process is defined in terms of absorbed stirring walks as explained in definition [ def1 ] below .    in the rest of this section",
