    "the following conjectures constitute the essence of the current standard picture of the gravitational collapse : i ) gravitational collapse results in a black hole ( weak cosmic censorship ) ii ) the spacetime settles down to a stationary final state .",
    "if we further assume that at some finite time all the matter fields have fallen into the black hole and hence the exterior region is pure vacuum ( for simplicity we discard electromagnetic fields in the exterior ) , then the black hole uniqueness theorem implies that the final state should be the kerr black hole .",
    "the kerr black hole is uniquely characterized by its mass @xmath1 and angular momentum @xmath2 .",
    "these quantities satisfy the following remarkable inequality @xmath3 from newtonian considerations , we can interpret this inequality as follows@xcite : in a collapse the gravitational attraction ( @xmath4 ) at the horizon ( @xmath5 ) dominates over the centrifugal repulsive forces ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "if the initial conditions for a collapse violate then the extra angular momentum should be radiated away in gravitational waves . however , in an axially symmetric spacetime the angular momentum is a conserved quantity ( the komar integral of the killing vector , see , for example , @xcite ) . in this case",
    "angular momentum can not be radiated : the angular momentum @xmath7 of the initial conditions must be equal to the final one @xmath2 .",
    "on the other hand , the mass of the initial conditions @xmath8 satisfies @xmath9 because gravitational radiation carries positive energy .",
    "then , from inequality we obtain @xmath10 more precisely , i)-ii ) imply that a complete , vacuum , axisymmetric , asymptotically flat data should satisfy inequality , where @xmath8 and @xmath7 are the mass and angular momentum of the data .",
    "moreover , the equality in should imply that the data are a slice of extreme kerr .",
    "this is a similar argument to the one used by penrose @xcite to obtain the inequality between mass and the area of the horizon on the initial data .",
    "as in the case of penrose inequality , a counter example of will imply that either i ) or ii ) is not true .",
    "conversely a proof of gives indirect evidence of the validity of i)-ii ) , since it is very hard to understand why this highly nontrivial inequality should hold unless i)-ii ) can be thought of as providing the underlying physical reason behind it ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "inequality is a property of the spacetime and not only of the data , since both quantities @xmath8 and @xmath7 are independent of the slicing .",
    "it is in fact a property of axisymmetric , vacuum , black holes space - times , because a non zero @xmath7 ( in vacuum ) implies a non trivial topology on the data and this is expected to signal the presence of a black hole .",
    "the physical interpretation of is the following : if we have a stationary vacuum black hole ( i.e. kerr ) and add to it axisymmetric gravitational waves , then the spacetime will still have a ( non - stationary ) black hole , these waves will only increase the mass and not the angular momentum of the spacetime because they are axially symmetric . since inequality is satisfied for kerr we get .    in this note",
    ", we review some recent results ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) in which inequality is proved for one black hole and describe the open problems for the other cases .",
    "inequality suggests the following variational principle :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the extreme kerr initial data are the absolute minimum of the mass among all axisymmetric , vacuum , asymptotically flat and complete initial data with fixed angular momentum .",

    "only a local version was proved using a variational principle @xcite .",
    "the key difference in the present case is axial symmetry . as we will see , in that case it possible to write the mass ( in an appropriate gauge ) as a positive definite integral on a spacelike hypersurface .",
    "the reason for this particular behavior of the mass is the following . in the presence of a symmetry",
    ", vacuum einstein equations can be reduced a la kaluza - klein to a system on a 3-dimensional manifold where it takes the form of 3-dimensional einstein equations coupled to a matter source . since in 3-dimension",
    "there is no radiation ( the weyl tensor is zero ) , this source represents the true gravitational degree of freedom that have descended from 4-dimensions to appear as `` matter '' in 3-dimension . since all the energy is produced by these effective matter sources , one would expect in that , as in other field theories , the total energy of the system can be expressed as a positive definite integral over them .",
    "this was in fact proved by brill @xcite in some restricted cases and then generalized in @xcite @xcite@xcite . using this formula and with the extra assumption that the data are maximal",
    ", the variational principle can be formulated in a very simple form @xcite .    to write the mass formula for axially symmetric spacetimes we follow @xcite .",
    "consider a vacuum solution of einstein s equations , i.e. , a four dimensional manifold @xmath11 with metric @xmath12 for which the ricci tensor @xmath13 vanishes .",
    "suppose , in addition , that there exists a spacetime killing vector @xmath14 .",
    "we define the norm and the twist of @xmath14 , respectively , by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the connection and @xmath17 the volume element with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "assuming that the manifold is simply connected and using @xmath18 it is possible to prove that @xmath19 is the gradient of a scalar field @xmath20 @xmath21 in our case the killing field will be spacelike , i.e. @xmath22 .",
    "as we mention above , in the presence of a killing field , there exists a well known procedure to reduce the field equations @xcite .",
    "let @xmath23 denote the collection of all trajectories of @xmath14 , and assume that it is a differential 3-manifold .",
    "we define the lorentzian metric @xmath24 on @xmath23 by @xmath25 four dimensional einstein vacuum equation are equivalent to einstein equations in three dimension on @xmath23 coupled to effective matter fields determined by @xmath26 and @xmath20 .",
    "we make a @xmath27 decomposition of these equations .",
    "let @xmath28 be the unit normal vector orthogonal to a spacelike , 2-dimensional slice @xmath29 .",
    "the intrinsic metric on @xmath29 is denoted by @xmath30 and the trace free part of the second fundamental form of the slice is denoted by @xmath31 .",
    "on @xmath32 we fix a gauge : the maximal - isothermal gauge ( see @xcite for details ) and the corresponding coordinates system @xmath33 .",
    "it is convenient to define the function @xmath34 by @xmath35    in this gauge the mass can be written in the following form @xmath36 where @xmath37 denote the volume element with respect to @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the covariant derivative with respect to @xmath30 with @xmath40 , and the prime denotes directional derivative with respect to @xmath41 , that is @xmath42 this is essentially a derivative with respect to @xmath43 .",
    "note that all the terms in the integrand of ( [ eq:15b ] ) are positive definite .",
    "the first three terms contain the dynamical part of the data , they vanish for stationary solutions , in particular for the kerr solution .",
    "the last two terms , contain the stationary part of the fields .",
    "it is important to note that the integral of these terms does not depends on the metric @xmath30 . in effect",
    ", the integral of these terms can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes partial derivatives with respect to @xmath46 .",
    "the integral ( [ eq:5c ] ) depends only on @xmath34 and @xmath20 .",
    "since we have @xmath47 to find the minimum of @xmath8 is equivalent as to find the minimums of @xmath48 .    in order to write the variational principle , it only remains to discuss the boundary conditions .",
    "physically , we want to prescribe boundary conditions such that the total angular momentum is fixed . the information of the angular momentum is determined by the value of the twist potential @xmath20 at the axis @xmath49 ( see @xcite ) . to include more than one black hole , we prescribe the following topology .",

    ". see figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "each point @xmath50 will correspond to an asymptotic end of the data , and hence we will say that the data contain @xmath58 black holes .",

    "the conjecture is open for the case @xmath64 .",
    "for this case , the variational problem is fixed if we impose the boundary condition @xmath65 with @xmath66 , for arbitrary constants @xmath67 .",
    "note however , that conjecture [ con:1 ] is independent of the values @xmath67 .    remarkably , in @xcite it is proved that the variational problem has a solution ( i.e. a minimum ) for arbitrary @xmath58 , but the value of @xmath48 for this solution is not known . in order to prove the conjecture for @xmath64 , one need to compute a lower bound for this quantity .",
