    "of all the open questions concerning neutrinos  mass scale and hierarchy , possible cp violation , origin of the mixing pattern  the conceptually most interesting has to be its very nature : is the neutrino its own antiparticle , and hence a majorana fermion , or do neutrino and antineutrino differ , making the neutrino a dirac particle like all the other fermions of the standard model ( sm )",
    ". the key observation here would be neutrinoless double beta decay @xmath4",
    "@xcite , @xmath5 , because the observation of this @xmath6 process unambiguously confirms the majorana nature of neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "other @xmath6 signatures , ranging from low - energy processes like neutrinoless double electron capture to collider processes , have also been proposed and tested ( a collection of references can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , but all experiments came up empty so far .",
    "the necessary lepton number violation ( lnv ) by two units , @xmath6 , can be realized directly with a tree level majorana mass term , or indirectly via diagrams containing two vertices with @xmath7 , one example being @xmath8-parity violating supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "however , it is most often overlooked that lnv and majorana neutrinos are not necessarily connected .",
    "for instance , there are non - perturbative processes in the sm that violate lepton ( and baryon ) number by three units @xcite , @xmath9 , which obviously do not lead to majorana neutrinos , and are in fact perfectly compatible with dirac neutrinos .    in this letter",
    "we will entertain the possibility that lnv occurs only by four units , and that @xmath6 processes are forbidden ; neutrinos are then dirac particles .",
    "we will realize those lepton number violating dirac neutrinos in a simple model based on a spontaneously broken @xmath10 . as an interesting consequence , neutrinoless quadruple beta decay ( @xmath11 ) ,",
    "@xmath12 is allowed .",
    "this novel nuclear decay process plays for our framework the role that neutrinoless double beta decay plays for majorana neutrinos : it will be the dominant possible lnv process for dirac neutrinos , which is surely of great conceptual interest even if the decay rates that we estimate are tiny",
    ". should be the next probable neutrinoless beta decay after @xmath13 .",
    "this process would however violate lorentz symmetry , similar to neutrinoless single beta decay @xmath14 . ]",
    "we will first construct a simple toy model that forbids majorana neutrinos but allows for lnv by four units .",
    "then we will search for interesting isotopes that can undergo @xmath11 and estimate the expected lifetimes .",
    "interestingly , all three isotopes that we identify as potential @xmath11-emitters ( @xmath15zr , @xmath16xe , and @xmath17nd ) are familiar from searches for neutrinoless double beta decay .",

    "we introduce three right - handed neutrinos @xmath23 ( rhns ) to the sm , which results in dirac masses for the neutrinos after spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "a striking feature of the chiral fermion content of the sm@xmath24 is the existence of a new , accidental , anomaly - free symmetry @xmath10 , which can therefore be consistently gauged in addition to the sm gauge group . breaking @xmath25 by a scalar @xmath26 with charge @xmath27",
    "can then lead to a remaining discrete symmetry group @xmath28 in the lepton sector , which protects the dirac structure of neutrinos and still allows for lnv processes .",

    "a bi - unitary transformation can be used to diagonalize this mass matrix via @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the lepton mixing matrix relevant for electroweak charged - current interactions .",
    "contrary to other models with dirac neutrinos , the right - handed transformation matrix @xmath39 does not drop out , but can be absorbed by the complex symmetric yukawa coupling matrix @xmath40 , which is non - diagonal in general .",
    "the scalar potential of our model is of the simple form @xmath41 here , the coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 have mass dimension one and zero , respectively . assuming @xmath44 and appropriate signs and magnitudes of the @xmath43",

    "all the above holds similarly for @xmath118 and @xmath119 as well . both have much smaller @xmath75-values  which theoretically reduces the rate  but @xmath103-stable daughter nuclei .",
    "the non - solid structure of xenon makes it in principle easier to check for the transmutation into cerium ; furthermore , the exo  @xcite @xmath13 experiment is currently running and could check for @xmath11 , should their detector be sensitive at these energies and not flooded by backgrounds .",

    "note that the energy - gain @xmath125 will here be carried away by photons instead of electrons ; the captured electrons will be taken out of the @xmath126 and @xmath127 shells , resulting in a cascade of x - ray photons .",
    "the @xmath75-values of @xmath128 and @xmath129 are high enough to also undergo @xmath130 ; @xmath129 is the only isotope capable of @xmath131",

    "the phase - space factor for the four final particles is the same as the one in @xmath97 ( proportional to @xmath142 for @xmath143  @xcite ) , which also tells us that each of the four electrons will be distributed just like the electrons in @xmath97 , with a different @xmath75-value , of course .",
    "purely on dimensional grounds we can then estimate the dependence of the half - life on our parameters as @xmath135^{-1 } \\propto q^{11 } \\left ( \\frac{g_f^4}{q^4 \\lambda^2 } \\right)^2 \\ , q^{18 } \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last factor is included to obtain the correct mass dimension .",
    "the above estimate is only valid for large @xmath75-values , as it assumes massless electrons ; the low @xmath2 of most elements in tab .",
    "[ tab:0nu4beta ] render ( some of ) the four electrons non - relativistic and make necessary a more accurate calculation of the phase space . to partially cancel the uncertainties , we can approximate that the phase space for @xmath11 and @xmath97 is overall similar and consider the ratio ( for @xmath1 and @xmath144{mev}$ ] ) @xmath145 this is of course a rough estimate , and a better calculation , dropping the implicitly used closure approximation , including effects of the nuclear coulomb field etc .",
    ", will certainly change this rate . to this effect",
    "we stress a difference between @xmath13 and @xmath11 : while the former decay proceeds via a kinematically forbidden intermediate state , the latter also features an energetically preferred intermediate state @xmath146 , only to rush past it on the mass parabola ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : termschema ] ) .",
    "since excited states of @xmath146 can still have a lower mass than our initial nucleus , the summation over all these states is important and can not be approximated away as easily as the excited states of an already forbidden intermediate state .    finally ,",
    "in our simple model from above , we generate the @xmath56 operator with rhns , @xmath62 , so each of the neutrinos in fig .  [ fig : quadruple_beta_decay ] requires a mass - flip in order to couple to the @xmath147 bosons .",
    "the particle physics amplitude is therefore further suppressed by a factor @xmath148 , making this process all the more unlikely .",
    "these mass - flips can be avoided in left ",
    "right - symmetric extensions of our model , at the price of replacing the four @xmath147 bosons in fig .",
    "[ fig : quadruple_beta_decay ] with their heavier @xmath149 counterparts .",
    "even with all our approximations leading to the above estimates , one can safely conclude that the half - life for neutrinoless quadruple beta decay is very large , at least if physics at the tev scale is behind it in any way .",
    "this may be a too conservative approach , because four - neutrino interactions do not suffer from such stringent constraints as other four - fermion interactions  @xcite . the effective lnv operator @xmath150 discussed here has not been constrained so far , and the contribution to the well - measured invisible @xmath151-width via @xmath152 only gives @xmath153{gev}$ ] .",
    "this , of course , only holds if the mediator is heavy enough to be integrated out in the first place .",
    "light mediators can significantly increase the rate ; the life - time will be minimal if the exchanged particles have masses of the order of @xmath154{mev}$ ] .",
    "for neutrinoless double beta decay the gain factor for the half - life is about @xmath155  @xcite , and we can expect something similar here .",
    "given that we have four neutrino propagators , the rate might be enhanced by a sizable factor , and therefore experimental searches for @xmath11 should be pursued .    while the expected rates for @xmath11 in our proof - of - principle model are unobservably small , more elaborate models  invoking resonances  might overcome this obstacle .",
    "most importantly , the experimental and nuclear - physics aspects of @xmath11 are completely independent of the underlying mechanism , and can therefore be readily investigated .",
    "contrary to popular belief , majorana neutrinos are not a prerequisite for lepton number violation , and we have given a simple counterexample of lepton number violating dirac neutrinos in this work .",
    "this gives rise to previously undiscussed @xmath56 processes , the most striking of which would be neutrinoless quadruple beta decay , which can in principle be observable in three nuclei .",
    "the most promising isotope is @xmath1 due to its high @xmath2-value and natural abundance ( see tab .  [ tab:0nu4beta ] ) , and existing experiments could already be used to test @xmath11 .",
    "let us stress that the decay should be constrained experimentally , as our theoretical estimates for tev - scale physics induced @xmath11 might be too conservative .",
