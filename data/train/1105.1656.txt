    "hawking radiation @xcite consists in the emission of pairs of quanta from a black - hole horizon : one with `` positive energy '' ( positive co - moving frequency ) towards the exterior and one with `` negative energy '' ( negative co - moving frequency ) towards the interior of the black hole .",
    "the emission has a thermal spectrum as seen by an asymptotic observer at infinity , with a temperature @xmath2 determined by the derivative of the free - fall velocity @xmath3 at the horizon @xmath4 : @xmath5 .",
    "this result can be obtained very simply in the semiclassical method .",
    "this tunneling description of hawking radiation , first introduced by volovik @xcite ( see also @xcite for the parikh - wilczek version , @xcite for its extension to @xmath6 massive particles , and the recent  @xcite for charged @xmath6 massive particles ) , indicates that the hawking process can be understood as the quantum tunneling across the horizon between classical trajectories on both sides of the horizon . the semiclassical method was also applied to hawking radiation from rotating  @xcite and charged  @xcite black holes , and to several higher - dimensional and other more exotic black hole geometries ( see e.g. @xcite for some recent examples ) , as well as to related phenomena such as the zeldovich - starobinsky effect @xcite ( see @xcite ) , and the unruh effect @xcite ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we will focus on massive particles in a schwarzschild geometry .",
    "if one is interested only in the spectrum as measured at infinity , then it is straightforward to arrive at the usual conclusions  @xcite , namely that there is a threshold @xmath7 for massive quanta , but otherwise , the spectrum does not differ from that of the standard massless case .",
    "however , although no @xmath1 particles arrive at infinity , they are nevertheless radiated from the horizon , see also  @xcite .",
    "we will calculate the probability for detecting such @xmath1 particles as a function of the distance from the horizon and the energy of the particle .",
    "we largely follow volovik s derivation and notation @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , focus on purely radial movement in a schwarzschild geometry and set @xmath8 .",
    "we start from the painlev - gullstrand - lematre ( pgl ) form of the schwarzschild line element : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the free - fall velocity and @xmath4 the horizon or schwarzschild radius . the pgl metric is stationary and moreover , unlike the schwarzschild form , it is regular across the horizon",
    ". this makes it particularly suited for the tunneling description of hawking radiation .    for a massive particle",
    ", one has @xmath11 with @xmath12 , leading to the energy - momentum dispersion relation @xmath13 since @xmath3 represents the free - fall velocity , it is natural to write this as @xmath14 and interpret @xmath15 as the doppler - shifted energy ( the energy in the `` black hole rest frame '' ) , which is a conserved quantity , and @xmath16 as the energy in a co - moving reference frame .",
    "this interpretation is reinforced by the observation that the pgl metric is also the natural metric in analogue gravity  @xcite , where it describes the propagation of sound waves or other perturbations on a background fluid moving with a velocity @xmath3 .",
    "we want to calculate the influence of the mass on the tunneling rate of particles from the black hole up to a detector ( where the particle can be captured in a bound state , see also  @xcite ) at an arbitrary fixed radial distance @xmath17 .",
    "the tunneling probability @xmath18 is determined by the imaginary part of the action @xmath19 along the semiclassical trajectory : @xmath20,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 follows from the dispersion relation .",
    "the final result will be of the form @xmath23\\exp[-2\\text{im}s_2]\\ ] ] with @xmath24 a contribution for tunneling through the horizon , and @xmath25 an additional action in case there is a second classically prohibited region beyond the horizon .",
    "we certainly expect @xmath26 when @xmath1 , since the massive particle is then classically forbidden [ see ] in flat spacetime [ @xmath27 .    from  ,",
    "we obtain @xmath28    note that , in order for the semiclassical formalism to be valid , the action must be large ( @xmath29 ) . in particular",
    ", this implies that we consider the case @xmath30 . in the opposite limit @xmath31",
    ", it was found in  @xcite that the created bound particles are localized mainly on resonant levels outside the black hole with large occupation numbers .      for @xmath33",
    ", we shift the contour of integration to the complex plane and apply the standard residue theorem @xmath34 .",
    "there is one pole along the radial path : @xmath35 at @xmath36 , so @xmath37 where the prime denotes @xmath38 .",
    "we recover the standard hawking result , as for a massless particle to reach infinity : the presence of a mass has absolutely no influence on the probability of tunneling across the horizon .",
    "@xmath40 will only have an imaginary contribution when @xmath41 for a schwarzschild black hole ( @xmath42 ) , this leads to @xmath43 for given @xmath17 .",
    "alternatively , it can be expressed as a condition on @xmath17 for given @xmath15 : @xmath44 for @xmath45 ( or @xmath46 ) , there is no additional barrier .",
    "once the particle has tunnelled through the horizon , it can freely propagate up to the detector at @xmath17 . at sufficient distance from the black hole ( @xmath47 )",
    ", the condition for a second imaginary contribution reduces to @xmath1 , as we anticipated .",
    "this means that , for @xmath7 , the mass term does not cause any additional tunneling factor , independently of @xmath17 , and we recover the standard result for massless particles all the way to @xmath48 . for @xmath1 , however , the particle is created with an energy @xmath15 which is insufficient to escape all the way to @xmath49 , so it will encounter a second barrier as @xmath3 decreases ( i.e. , as the particle moves towards flat spacetime ) .    in case of",
