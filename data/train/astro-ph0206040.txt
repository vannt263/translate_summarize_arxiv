    "the presence of a dark matter component is inferred through gravitational interactions in galaxies and clusters of galaxies .",
    "its contribution is estimated to be about 30% of the critical density of the universe .",
    "this dark matter can not be all baryonic .",
    "constraints from primordial nucleosynthesis and cosmic background radiation measurements limit the baryonic content of the universe to be at most about 4% of the critical density .",
    "the remaining @xmath1 26% of the critical density is believed to be composed of a , yet to be observed , cold dark matter ( cdm ) particle .    among the several candidates proposed for the non - baryonic dark matter , the leading scenario involves weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) . weakly interacting relics from the early universe with masses from some tens of gev to some tev",
    "can naturally give rise to relic densities in the range of the observed dark matter density .",
    "wimps are also well motivated by theoretical extensions of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "in particular , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model can be a wimp that is stable due to r - parity conservation . in most scenarios",
    "the lsp is neutral and is called the neutralino , @xmath2 ( for a review see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "neutralinos may be detected directly as they traverse the earth , may be generated in future particle colliders , and may be detected indirectly by observing their annihilation products .",
    "direct neutralino searches are now underway in a number of low background experiments with no consensus detection to date .",
    "collider experiments have been able to place some constraints on the neutralino parameter space ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , but a large region of the parameter space is still unexplored .",
    "indirect searches offer a viable and complementary alternative to direct searches and accelerator experiments .",
    "in particular , neutralino annihilation in the galactic halo can be observed via @xmath0-rays , neutrinos , and synchrotron emission from the charged annihilation products  @xcite .",
    "the rate of neutralino annihilation is proportional to the neutralino number density squared ( @xmath3 ) , thus the strongest signals are likely to come from either the galactic center  @xcite , or the higher density nearby clumps of dark matter in our halo  @xcite .",
    "the dark matter density in the galactic center depends strongly on the formation history of the central black hole  @xcite , and its @xmath0-ray emission due to neutralino annihilation may be difficult to distinguish from other baryonic @xmath0-ray sources . as an alternative , the clumpy nature of cdm halos provides a number of high density regions , other than the galactic center .",
    "clumps of dark matter distributed throughout galaxy halos is a generic prediction of high - resolution cdm simulations ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this high degree of substructure is what has remained from the merging of small halos to form the larger halos ( either cluster or galaxy halos ) .",
    "simulations show that about @xmath4 to @xmath5 of the total mass of a given halo is in the form of smaller mass clumps .",
    "these clumps are ideal sites for neutralino annihilation and can be observed via their @xmath0-ray signal  @xcite , and via their synchrotron emission  @xcite . here , we study in detail the @xmath0-ray emission from the nearest clumps of dark matter via atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( acts ) , such as veritas @xcite , hess @xcite , magic @xcite , and cangaroo - iii @xcite .",
    "we explore the neutralino parameter space for the continuum , the @xmath6 , and the @xmath7 lines and calculate the flux of different mass clumps assuming different clump density profiles and veritas specifications .",
    "we find that the larger mass clumps can be easily detected by the next generation acts and that the detectability of the smaller mass clumps can help constrain the neutralino parameter space .",
    "future act observations are only limited by their threshold energy and will be more effective for neutralino masses above @xmath8 50 to 100 gev , a range of neutralino masses that nicely complements accelerator and satellite studies of the neutralino parameter space .    in the next section",
    ", we discuss the structure and the mass spectrum of the dark matter clumps that we assume in our study .",
    "in  iii , we present the neutralino parameter space for continuum @xmath0-rays , the @xmath6 , and the @xmath7 line emission using darksusy  @xcite . in ",
    "iv , we discuss the characteristics of acts and the relevant backgrounds . our results and strategies for cdm clump detection are shown in ",
    "v. finally , we conclude in  vi .",
    "according to n - body simulations  @xcite , substructures of masses @xmath9 survive in significant numbers in galactic halos . within the virial radius of a galactic halo about",
    "10%-15% of the mass is in the form of dark matter clumps .",
    "the mass spectrum for the simulated dark matter clumps in galactic halos is of the form ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) @xmath10 for clumps with mass @xmath11 , the lowest resolvable mass , approximately .",
    "clumps are more numerous the less massive they are , thus one would expect a large number of relatively light clumps .",
    "simulations find @xmath12 ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt the same value here and extrapolate to lower masses than those presently resolved by simulations . with this extrapolation",
    "we can estimate the numbers of clumps in specific mass bins , as well as the distances to the nearest of these clumps .    in order to find the proportionality constant in eq.([distribution ] ) , we normalize the mass function so that 500 satellites exist within the galactic halo with masses above @xmath13 , in agreement with the predictions of n - body simulations for a halo like ours  @xcite .",
    "thus we find for the predicted number , @xmath14 , of clumps with mass @xmath15 greater than @xmath16 , in solar masses , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the maximum mass clump in the halo .",
    "using our halo as the host within which the clumps are orbiting , we assume @xmath19 .    the number , @xmath20 , of clumps predicted in several mass bins that lie in the mass range from @xmath21 up to @xmath13 are tabulated in the first and second columns of table [ numbers ] .",
    "we choose each bin labeled by @xmath22 to contain clumps with mass in the range @xmath23 $ ] , and calculate @xmath24 .",
    "the numbers appear to be high enough , and even though they are consistent with simulations , the question whether they can be realistic is raised .",
    "contrary to what was initially believed , namely that large numbers of substructures within a galactic halo might threaten the stability of the disk , nowadays we know that this is not the case ( for a recent review , see  @xcite ) .",
    "it has been found , first , that the orbits of satellite substructures in present - day halos very rarely take them near the disk  @xcite , and second , that disk overheating and stability would become real problems only when interactions with numerous , large satellites ( e.g. , the lmc ) take place  @xcite .",
    "consequently , these numbers can be considered perfectly realistic . in the third column of table [ numbers ] we give values of the mean inter - clump distance in a specific mass bin , assuming that the clumps are homogeneously distributed within the virial extend of the halo .",
    "thus , in the third column we have the quantity @xmath25 , with @xmath26 the virial radius of the galactic halo which we take to be equal to 300 kpc .",
    "however , clumps are unlikely to be homogeneously distributed in the host halo .",
    "it is believed that they are distributed in a way similar to the way the smooth component of the dark matter halo is distributed ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we estimate another measure for the distance , the distance to the nearest clump for each mass bin , as follows : first , we calculate the fraction , @xmath27 , of the total dark matter of the galaxy which is in the form of clumps of mass @xmath22 and take @xmath28 . for a local dark matter density @xmath29pc@xmath30 and using the above fractions we find the local dark matter density which is in clumps of a specific mass . going from the mass to the number density",
    ", we find the distance to the nearest clump , @xmath31 ( see also  @xcite ) . as we can see from table [ numbers ]",
    ", @xmath32 can be a factor of ten smaller than the mean distance as calculated in the homogeneous distribution case .",
    "we use @xmath32 below when estimating @xmath0-ray fluxes from different clumps .",
    ".[numbers ] numbers of clumps , mean and nearest clump distances . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     from the two tables we see that the least likely case of clumps , namely clumps as dense as the sis , can be easily detectable in less than 100 hrs . in the case of the moore et al .",
    "profile , the higher mass clumps ( @xmath33 ) will be easily detectable since both @xmath34 and @xmath35 exceed the minimum required flux , @xmath36 , to achieve a 5-@xmath37 detection level .",
    "the lower mass clumps have an easily detectable @xmath35 , but not necessarily a detectable @xmath34 . a @xmath38 moore et al",
    ". clump would have a detectable @xmath34 for either a large integration times ( @xmath39 s @xmath401 month ) , or for larger collective areas ( e.g. , @xmath41 at 50 gev ) , which is not among the abilities of both existing and upcoming acts .",
    "finally , nfw clumps with @xmath42 are detectable and this is particularly important given the egret constraints placed on the most concentrated clumps , such as sis and moore et al .",
    "in contrast , even a whole year of observation ( @xmath43s ) would not be enough to detect smaller mass nfw clumps with fluxes that are closer to the corresponding @xmath34 .",
    "the minimum detectable cross section @xmath44 for annihilation into monochromatic @xmath0-rays with energy equal to @xmath45 , as a function of @xmath45 is shown for @xmath46 and @xmath47 in fig.[2g - susy ] .",
    "the constraining curves stop at @xmath48 , which in this case is 50 gev ( below this the cross section is non - zero , but the number of photons with energy above 50 gev coming from neutralinos with mass less than 50 gev is , of course , 0 ) .",
    "a first , clear difference , in comparison with the continuum @xmath0-rays , is the fact that the susy parameter space is significantly wider with respect to the cross section .",
    "therefore , imposing constraints on the susy parameter space using the detectability ( or non - detectability ) of the clumps through their @xmath6 line emission will be harder than through their continuum emission .",
    "nevertheless , if lines are detected in addition to the continuum , the degeneracy in the susy parameter space will be lifted since a narrower range of models would fit both detections .",
    "this is depicted more quantitatively in fig.[2g - flux ] where we present the flux of monochromatic @xmath0-rays as a function of @xmath45 , as well as the minimum detectable flux and the two major background contributions .",
    "note that in this case both the minimum detectable flux and the background fluxes depend on @xmath45 , given that the energy of the monochromatic @xmath0-rays is equal to @xmath45 . as we did in the case of the continuum , to find the flux coming from a given clump",
    "we assume a typical cross section , in order to express the flux only as a function of @xmath45 . based on the susy parameter space presented in fig.[2g - susy ] ,",
    "we choose the large cross section region and use @xmath49 cm@xmath30s@xmath51 .",
    "this value yields a flux close to the maximum possible flux such that a comparison can be attempted with the continuum case , which is generally stronger .",
    "we see , however , from fig.[2g - flux ] that even in this case , the @xmath6 line will not be observable with upcoming acts . more specifically , for @xmath52 the chances of observing such a light clump in the monochromatic @xmath0-ray lines are bad , regardless of neutralino mass . with respect to the density profile , neither",
    "the moore et al . nor",
    "the nfw will be detectable . in the case of a density profile between the moore et al . and the sis",
    ", observability could be achieved imposing at the same time an upper limit on @xmath45 . in the case of @xmath53 ,",
    "a moore et al .",
    "clump will be detectable as long as @xmath54 4.5 tev , whereas the same clump , if described by an nfw profile , would be detectable only if @xmath5568 gev .",
    "the case is similar for the @xmath7 line .",
    "results for the susy parameter space are presented in fig.[2z - susy ] , for @xmath56 and @xmath57 . in these figures",
    "we require that @xmath58 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath59 , this implies that the neutralino mass @xmath60 which translates to @xmath61 gev for @xmath62 gev .",
    "the two lines are expected to coincide at relatively large @xmath45 , and thus , the conclusions for both are similar with the difference that due to the above constraint the @xmath7 line explores the parameter space starting from higher neutralino masses compared to the @xmath63 line . in addition , the susy models corresponding to @xmath45 above 500 gev are less dispersed in the case of the @xmath7 line than in the case of the @xmath6 . again",
    ", this will help lift degeneracies of neutralino models , if any clumps are detected .",
    "the flux as a function of neutralino mass assuming a maximum @xmath64 cm@xmath30 s@xmath51 , is shown in fig.[2z - flux ] .",
    "in general the conclusions are the same as in the @xmath63 line .",
    "the light clumps are not very promising with respect to their detectability .",
    "a @xmath13 moore et al .",
    "clump will be detectable as long as @xmath55 6 tev .",
    "note , however , that this is true under the assumption of the maximum @xmath65 , and thus of the maximum possible flux .",
    "the results presented above were based on specific choices for the detector and the observation parameters .",
    "it is worth noting that these results can be easily scaled with some of these parameters .",
    "for instance , the effective area @xmath66 and observation time @xmath67 have a simple scaling . the minimum detectable @xmath68 for a specific @xmath45 scales as @xmath69 .",
    "an order of magnitude lower @xmath68 could be explored using two orders of magnitude higher @xmath70 , for example , @xmath71 @xmath72 and @xmath73 s ( @xmath1 40 days ) .",
    "this would be very helpful in the case of the hard to detect lines ( see fig.[2g - susy ] and fig.[2z - susy ] ) .",
    "if some clumps are detected in the continuum , a reasonable strategy would be to subsequently search for the weaker line signal over a longer @xmath67 .",
    "similarly , the minimum detectable flux plotted in figs.[conti - flux ] , [ 2g - flux ] , and [ 2z - flux ] , depends on the combination @xmath74 . with respect to the angular resolution @xmath75 , the minimum detectable @xmath76 has a dependance of the form @xmath77 , approximately , while the minimum detectable fluxes are @xmath78 .",
    "note that although the nearest clumps are resolved , we used the angular resolution of the instrument and not the angular size of the clumps as the relevant angle for the collection of background noise , assuming that we observe the central pixel of the source  where most of the source counts originate from  treating thus , the source with respect to the backgrounds as being effectively unresolved . if , instead , one uses the angular size of the object as the relevant angle for the collection of noise , both the detectable cross sections and the minimum detectable fluxes are about two and one orders of magnitude higher for a @xmath13 and a @xmath79 clump , respectively .",
    "an essential parameter in our calculations is the distance of the source from the earth , which we assumed to be the estimated distance to the nearest clump .",
    "however , our results can be easily extended to larger distances or , equivalently , to lower numbers of clumps given the @xmath80 dependence of the flux , which is actually the most significant dependence of our results on the distance  @xcite .",
    "for example , one order of magnitude larger distance makes the minimum @xmath76 that can be explored two orders of magnitude higher ; the same is true for the minimum detectable fluxes .",
    "this is very useful given the recent bounds on sis and moore et al .",
    "clumps from egret data  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , only nfw clumps can populate the whole halo as seen in cdm simulations without overwhelming egret limits . for the other density profiles , consistency with egret data could imply , e.g. , a smaller than currently believed clump abundance , which would translate , in our case , to larger distances of the clumps . using the above scaling of our results with distance , it is easy to conclude with respect to the clump detectability in any other case that would change the distance estimate .",
    "similar is the case for the density profile assumed for the clumps ; the detectability of a density profile , e.g. , with central concentration in between that of the moore at al . and the nfw profiles , can be predicted , at least qualitatively , using our results .",
    "the choice of the energy threshold will be a crucial factor determining what will be the minimum @xmath45 values accessible to acts .",
    "an energy threshold low enough , along with the ability of acts to identify primaries leading thus to backgrounds smaller by an order of magnitude , are highly desirable for future acts , if they are to be used to explore the susy parameter space and detect even the less concentrated clumps such as the nfw case .",
    "in addition , we would like to re - emphasize the strategy of combining observations in the continuum and the annihilation lines for different clump masses in order to constrain more effectively the susy parameter space .",
    "for example , from figs.[conti - flux ] and  [ 2g - flux ] we saw that a low mass clump has an @xmath45 detectability range of the form @xmath81 . combining this with line observations , one could narrow the range of neutralino masses .",
    "more precisely , one should study the allowed models in susy parameter space that fit the detected continuum flux and check which ones give a detectable line signal .",
    "the detectability of the lines can yield @xmath45 detectability ranges of the form @xmath82 for various combinations of clumps masses and density profiles , assuming a typical or an optimum @xmath68 for the neutralino annihilation .",
    "assuming for the lines the maximum @xmath83 , a @xmath13 moore et al .",
    "clump will be detectable both in the continuum and in the lines , if @xmath45 is somewhere between 65 gev and 4.5 tev , where @xmath84 65 gev comes from the continuum limit and @xmath554.5 tev comes from the lines .",
    "although not a very narrow interval in @xmath45 , excluding the very low mass end of the allowed neutralino mass range in combination with an upper @xmath45-limit for detectability , can be very useful .",
    "it would narrow down the range in @xmath85 significantly .",
    "another example is that of a @xmath13 nfw clump which is detectable in either the continuum ( detectability range : 77 gev @xmath86 5 tev ) or the @xmath87 line ( detectability range : @xmath88 68 gev ) , but not both .",
    "this fact can , in principle , be used to extract information about the mass of the clump .",
    "our study of the detectability of clumps by acts is closely tied to the lack of knowledge with respect to the susy parameters .",
    "thus our results can be used in two ways , depending mainly on what will be determined first , the neutralino parameters or the distribution and profiles of cdm clumps . if clumps are discovered first ( for example , through synchrotron emission or from glast @xmath0-ray observations ) , @xmath0-ray studies by acts can help narrow the neutralino parameter space . in most cases ,",
    "the strongest constraints on the susy parameter space arise from the non - detectability in @xmath0-rays of a clump seen , e.g. , in the microwaves  @xcite rather than its detectability as , for example , in the case of a @xmath13 moore et al .",
    ". such a clump will be detectable in both the continuum and the lines if @xmath45 is between 65 and 4.5 tev .",
    "this large range of neutralino masses can be ruled out if the clump is not detected by veritas .",
    "this can become quite useful in the future . for the time being ,",
    "what is even more important is that such a clump , if existent , will be easily detectable almost for any possible neutralino mass .    summarizing , we conclude that the chances of detectability of dark matter clumps in the galactic halo , due to continuum @xmath0-rays produced by neutralino annihilation via upcoming acts are very good , especially in the case of relatively massive and highly centrally concentrated clumps .",
    "the signatures expected in the form of the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 lines are less easily detectable , but can be quite useful in lifting degeneracies among neutralino susy parameters .",
    "if we figure out the neutralino parameters first , act searches will be strong tests of the cdm model predictions with respect both the substructure in galactic halos and the density profiles of the substructure clumps .",
    "act searches will be able to explore large ranges of neutralino masses above @xmath89 50 gev ( or more , depending on the energy threshold ) .",
    "these studies will complement the searches for lower mass neutralinos , accessible through high energy accelerators , direct and other indirect detection methods , and satellite @xmath0-ray telescopes such as glast .",

    "similar is the conclusion with respect to the mass , @xmath90 , that appears in eq.([tidal ] ) .",
    "namely , for the distances from the galactic center that are relevant here , both profiles yield similar results .",
    "more generally , for an @xmath91 behavior of the density profile at the center , the contribution of the core to the flux scales as @xmath92 , which implies a sensitive dependence on @xmath93 for @xmath94 , assuming of course that @xmath95 .",
    "note however that the behavior of the density profile at intermediate distances ( @xmath96 ) might also be important in some cases in determining the overall dependence of the flux on @xmath93 .",
