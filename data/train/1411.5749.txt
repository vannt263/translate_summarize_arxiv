    "black hole thermodynamics has been an exciting and challenging topic in theoretical physics .",
    "inspired especially by the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , the anti - de sitter ( ads ) black hole thermodynamics has attracted much attention .",
    "it was first noted that in ads space , there exists hawking - page phase transition between a stable large black hole and thermal gas @xcite , which can be explained as the confinement / deconfinement phase transition of the gauge field @xcite",
    ".    further study of charged ads black holes revealed that there is a first - order phase transition between small and large black holes in the canonical ensemble @xcite . with an increase of the temperature , the phase transition point terminates at a critical point , where the first - order phase transition becomes a second - order one .",
    "the behavior of such a phase transition is quite similar to the van der waals ( vdw ) fluid .",
    "most recently , the investigation of the ads black hole thermodynamics has been generalized to the extended phase space , where the cosmological constant is treated as a dynamical pressure and its conjugate quantity is the thermodynamic volume of the black hole @xcite .",
    "phase transition in the charged ads black hole was reexamined in ref .",
    "it was found that the black hole system and the vdw system share the same pressure - thermodynamic ( @xmath0)oscillatory behavior , critical exponents , and scaling laws .",
    "thus , the precise analogy between the charged ads black hole and the vdw system was established .",
    "later , the study of the ads black hole phase transition in extended phase space was generalized to different ads black hole backgrounds @xcite . in these studies , it was shown that besides the small / large black hole first - order phase transition reminiscent of the liquid / gas transition of the vdw fluid , there were also some new interesting phenomena , such as reentrant phase transitions of multicomponent liquids , multiple first - order solid / liquid / gas phase transitions , and liquid / gas phase transitions of the vdw type .",
    "for example , the ( @xmath1)-dimensional single spinning vacuum kerr - ads black hole demonstrates the peculiar behavior of the large / small / large black hole phase transitions @xcite , and the multiply rotating kerr - ads black hole system displays a small / intermediate / large black hole phase transition with one tricritical and two critical points in some range of the parameters @xcite .",
    "the doubly spinning myers - perry black hole also has a similar reentrant phase transition structure @xcite .",
    "such a reentrant phase transition is also observed in modified gravity theories , such as born - infeld gravity @xcite , gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite , and lovelock gravity @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , understanding the thermodynamic properties of a black hole system along or across the coexistence curve is also an interesting subject .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite calculated the quasinormal modes of massless scalar perturbations around the small and large four - dimensional charged ads black holes .",
    "the result showed that the quasinormal modes can be a dynamic probe of the thermodynamic phase transition .",
    "toward understanding the thermodynamic properties of the charged ads black hole system along or across the coexistence curve , one expects an analytic formula of the coexistence curve .",
    "however , there is only a numerical calculation of it . in this paper , we reconsider the small / large black hole phase transition and present the fitting formula of the coexistence curve in the reduced parameter space for ( @xmath2)-dimensional charged ads black holes .",
    "the result confirms our analysis that the fitting formula is independent of charge for any dimension @xmath3 .",
    "along the coexistence curve , the clapeyron equations are also reexamined . besides the conventional one ,",
    "two additional equations are obtained in the extended phase space .",
    "based on the fitting formula of the coexistence curve , these clapeyron equations are numerically checked .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ dddd ] , we investigate the equal area laws and the clapeyron equations in the extended phase space for the charged ads black hole . in sec .",
    "[ equalarealaw ] , we present the fitting formula of the coexistence curve and check the clapeyron equations",
    ". we will summarize our results in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "recently , there has been great interest in studying the phase transition by treating the cosmological constant as a dynamical pressure , i.e. , @xmath4 with such a new interpretation , the cosmological constant can be regarded as a new thermodynamic variable . in this extended phase space , the black hole mass @xmath5 is considered as the enthalpy @xmath6 rather than the internal energy of the gravitational system @xcite , and the smarr relation for a @xmath3-dimensional charged ads black hole is modified as @xmath7 differentiating it , we get the first law : @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the thermodynamic volume @xmath10 furthermore , the gibbs free energy can be obtained by the legendre transformations @xmath11 for a specific spacetime background , one can clearly get its gibbs free energy . considering that the thermodynamic system prefers a low gibbs free energy ,",
    "we then can obtain its phase transition information .",
    "now the study of phase transition has been applied to a number of ads black holes , and richer phase structures are displayed .",
    "many ads black hole systems exhibit the small / large black hole phase transition , which is reminiscent of the vdw liquid / gas phase transition .",
    "the state equation for them can be expressed as @xmath12 analogous to the vdw fluid , here @xmath13 can be interpreted as the specific volume of the black hole fluid .",
    "study shows that both of them share the similar physical properties , such as the @xmath14 ( pressure - specific volume ) oscillatory behavior , the critical exponents , and scaling laws near the critical point",
    ". moreover the reentrant phase transitions were also found in the black hole system .",
    "in general , the phase diagram or the coexistence curve can be obtained by analyzing the characteristic swallow tail behavior of the gibbs free energy , and it is extensively used in the related papers . on the other hand ,",
    "it can also be obtained by constructing the maxwell s equal area law . however , after a simple check , we arrive at the result that the phase diagrams obtained from the gibbs free energy and the equal area law in @xmath14 behavior are not consistent with each other .",
    "we suggest that the problem originates from the confusion of thermodynamic volume @xmath9 and specific volume @xmath13 . for the vdw fluid , the equal area law is effective for both thermodynamic and specific volumes , because @xmath15 , with @xmath16 being a fixed constant denoting the total number of the fluid molecules . for the black hole case ,",
    "however , such a linear relation does not hold anymore .",
    "thus , considering eq .",
    "( [ gibss ] ) , the maxwell s equal area law is effective only for the thermodynamic volume @xmath9 in a black hole system .      before discussing the equal area law",
    ", we plot a sketch picture of the phase diagram in fig .",
    "the red line denotes the coexistence curve , above and below which there are two different system phases .",
    "each point located on the curve corresponds to two different phases while having the same gibbs free energy .",
    "for example , states @xmath17 and @xmath18 are related by one system phase , while states @xmath19 and @xmath20 by another phase . between them , states @xmath17 @xmath21 and @xmath19 @xmath22 have the same gibbs free energy .    considering that a system transforms state @xmath17 to @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath23 , we have @xmath24 now",
    ", we integrate it : @xmath25    * case i : * charge @xmath26 and temperature @xmath27 fixed . for this case",
    ", we consider the isotherm in the @xmath0 plane .",
    "therefore , the first and second terms in eq .",
    "( [ int ] ) vanish , and we get @xmath28 along the coexistence curve , we know that the two states have the same pressure , i.e. , @xmath29 . here",
    "we show the isotherm in the @xmath30 plane in fig .",
    "it is clear that oscillatory behavior exists .",
    "then the integral in eq . ( [ vp0 ] )",
    "can be reexpressed as @xmath31 the pressure @xmath32 is equivalent to that of the phase transition pressure . from fig .",
    "[ pvt ] , we are see clearly that the first bracket in ( [ interalvdp ] ) denotes the area of region ii and the second one the negative area of region i. thus , we get @xmath33 this is in fact the maxwell s equal area law , and we are familiar with it as showed in the @xmath0 plane [ see fig . [ ptv ] ] .",
    "therefore , we see that this equal area law holds during the phase transition .",
    "on the other hand , we can also use such an area law to find the value of the phase transition parameter .",
    "letting the temperature @xmath27 take all possible values , we will obtain the phase diagram for each charge @xmath26 using such an area law .",
    "it is also worthwhile to note that this equal area law is effective for the thermodynamic volume @xmath9 rather the specific volume @xmath13 .     and",

    ", we see that the equal area law holds in the @xmath0 plane with @xmath26 and @xmath27 fixed .",
    "there is an equivalent choice in which @xmath26 and @xmath34 are fixed .",
    "under such a choice , one can carry out the above analysis and the equal area law will be found in the temperature - entropy ( @xmath35 ) plane .",
    "this generalized area law was first studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "* case iii : * pressure @xmath34 and temperature @xmath27 fixed .",
    "during the phase transition , eq .",
    "( [ int ] ) reduces to @xmath36 which can be reexpressed as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is considered .",
    "this equation is just another expression of the equal area law .    here",
    ", it is clear that the maxwell s equal area law for the charged ads black hole gets a generalization . and the three area laws are consistent with each other .      here",
    "we continue to consider the manner in which the black hole system passes from state @xmath17 to @xmath19 .",
    "the gibbs free energies related to the two states are @xmath39 taking charge @xmath26 as fixed and noting that @xmath40 , we have @xmath41 then the phase transition pressure can be expressed as @xmath42 a similar calculation can be applied to the case of fixed @xmath43 , which corresponds to the grand canonical ensemble , and eq .",
    "( [ pa ] ) becomes @xmath44      the clapeyron equation is a useful equation for studying the liquid / gas phase transition of the vdw fluid .",
    "here we will review it and make a generalization to the charged black hole system among the small / large black hole phase transition .",
    "since states @xmath17 and @xmath19 , @xmath18 and @xmath20 are in phase equilibrium , @xmath45 thus @xmath46 if states @xmath17 ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath18 ( @xmath20 ) are very close , we then have @xmath47 by inserting them into eq .",
    "( [ gg ] ) , we easily get @xmath48 taking @xmath26 , @xmath34 , and @xmath27 as fixed , we obtain , respectively @xmath49 the first one is just the conventional clapeyron equation .",
    "the other two are the generalized clapeyron equations in the extended phase space of the charged ads black hole system . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the author has checked eq .",
    "( [ clapeyron ] ) for the black hole / ads space phase transition in the nonrotating and rotating black hole systems .",
    "however , checking these equations during the small / large black hole phase transition requires a numerical calculation , and we will carry that out in the next section . using these equations , one can easily check the maxwell s relation @xmath50 . on the other hand , the pressure @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ pa ] ) can be reexpressed as @xmath52",
    "here we first give a brief review of the charged ads black hole .",

    "note that the gibbs free energy for ads space also vanishes .",
    "hence it seems that at that point the black hole phase and the ads space phase can coexist .",
    "however , the concept that  empty charged space \" is unphysical .",
    "thus we could not compare these two phases with fixed charge together , and the ads phase will not be considered in the following discussion .    after excluding the ads space phase , the system will first go along the small black hole branch with the increasing of @xmath27 until the point @xmath5 is arrived , where the small and large black holes have the same gibbs free energy , and the small and large black holes can coexist at that point . with the temperature further increasing , the system will prefer the large black hole with lower gibbs free energy over the small and intermediate black holes .",
    "that is the small / large black hole phase transition .        in the extended phase space ,",
    "the small / large black hole phase transition was well studied in ref .",
    "this phase transition is reminiscent of the liquid / gas phase transition of the vdw fluid .",
    "this coexistence curve has positive slope everywhere and terminates at the critical point @xmath62 , above which the small and large black hole phases can not be clearly distinguished .",
    "the critical point is determined by @xmath63 by solving the above two equations , we get the critical point : @xmath64 with the critical specific volume @xmath65 .",
    "here we would like to give a brief discussion of the thermodynamic quantities and phase transition in the reduced parameter space .",
    "the reduced thermodynamic quantity corresponding to @xmath17 can be defined as @xmath66 with @xmath67 being its critical value . then the reduced temperature and",
    "the gibbs free energy can be expressed as @xmath68 from which we can see that @xmath69 and @xmath70 are independent of the black hole charge @xmath26",
    ". using the fact that the phase transition point is determined by the swallow tail behavior of the gibbs free energy , we can get the natural result that the phase transition in the reduced parameter space is charge independent .",
