    "<S> we study the extensions of teleparallism in the kaluza - klein ( kk ) scenario by writing the analogous form to the torsion scalar @xmath0 in terms of the corresponding antisymmetric tensors , given by @xmath1 , in the four - dimensional new general relativity ( ngr ) with arbitrary coefficients @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . after the kk dimensional reduction </S>",
    "<S> , the lagrangian in the einstein - frame can be realized by taking @xmath5 with the ghost - free condition @xmath6 for the one - parameter family of teleparallelism . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the conformal invariant gravity models can be constructed by the requirement of @xmath7 or @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , this conformal gravity is described on the weyl - cartan geometry @xmath9 with the ghost - free condition @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the weak field approximation and discuss the non - minimal coupled term of the scalar current and torsion vector . for the conformal invariant models with @xmath8 , we find that only the anti - symmetric tensor field is allowed rather than the symmetric one . </S>"
