    "among the recently discovered fe - based superconductors@xcite , the highest superconducting transition temperature @xmath2 of 56k has been reported in smfeas(o , f)@xcite . this new class of material shows very high upper critical fields at low temperatures together with a moderate anisotropy ranging from 4 to 7@xcite , which is suitable for high - field magnet applications .",
    "hence several attempts on wire fabrication using smfeas(o , f ) by powder - in - tube technique ( pit ) have already been reported@xcite , despite the lack of information on the field and orientation dependence of intra - grain critical current density [ i.e. , @xmath3 . in order to exploit this material class , the knowledge of these properties",
    "should be clarified .",
    "epitaxial thin films are favourable for electronics device applications and investigating transport as well as optical properties thanks to their geometry .",
    "recent success in fabricating epitaxial fe - based superconducting thin films opens a great opportunity for investigating their physical properties and exploring possible superconducting applications . to date ,",
    "high - field transport properties of co - doped srfe@xmath4as@xmath4 ( sr-122 ) and bafe@xmath4as@xmath4 ( ba-122 ) , and fe(se , te ) epitaxial thin films have been reported by several groups@xcite .",
    "for co - doped ba-122 , @xmath5 performance can be tuned by introduction of artificial pinning centers and proton irradiation@xcite .",
    "additionally , multilayer approaches that can tailor superconducting properties and their anisotropy have been reported by lee @xmath6 @xmath7@xcite .",
    "furthermore , epitaxial co - doped ba-122 and fe(se , te ) thin films have been realised on ion beam assisted deposition mgo coated conductor templates@xcite and the rolling - assisted biaxially textured substrate@xcite , respectively .",
    "similarly , high performance k - doped ba-122 and sr-122 wires by pit have been reported by weiss @xmath6 @xmath7.@xcite and gao @xmath6 @xmath7@xcite , respectively .",
    "these results are very promising for realising fe - based superconducting high - field applications .",
    "however , transport critical current properties of high-@xmath2 ( i.e. , over 50k ) oxypnictide thin films have not been reported before due to the absence of high quality films .",
    "recently , @xmath8 @xmath9 prepared @xmath10feas(o , f ) ( @xmath10=nd and sm ) epitaxial thin films with @xmath2 exceeding 50k have been realised by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe)@xcite .",
    "these successes give many possibilities to explore electro - magnetic properties .    in this paper",
    ", we report on various @xmath11 ( i.e. , current is flowing on the crystallographical @xmath12-plane ) transport properties up to 45 t of epitaxial smfeas(o , f ) thin films grown by mbe on caf@xmath4 ( 001 ) single crystalline substrates and discuss their pinning properties . a high @xmath5 of over 10@xmath0a/@xmath1 was recorded at 45 t and 4.2k for both crystallographic directions , which is favourable for high - field magnet applications . by analysing pinning properties the dimensional crossover between the out - of - plane superconducting coherence length @xmath13 and the fe - as interlayer distance @xmath14",
    "was observed at 30 - 40k .",
    "this indicates the possible intrinsic josephson junction in smfeas(o , f ) at low temperatures .",
    "as verified by x - ray diffraction , the biaxially textured smfeas(o , f ) film with a narrow full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of less than 0.65@xmath15 was obtained ( see in supplementary fig.s1 ) . as shown in fig.[fig : figure1]a , trapezoid shaped sm(o , f ) cap layers , which are changed from smf@xmath16 , are aligned discontinuously .",
    "additionally , a crystallographically disordered layer with around 20 nm thickness as indicated by the arrows is present between sm(o , f ) cap and smfeas(o , f ) layers .",
    "relatively dark particles are observed in the smfeas(o , f ) matrix , which are identified as iron - fluoride , presumably fef@xmath4 , by elemental mappings shown in figs.[fig : figure1]b and [ fig : figure1]c .",
    "this is due to the excess of fe supplied during the film growth .",
    "compared to fe(se , te)@xcite and co - doped ba-122 films@xcite grown by pulsed laser deposition , a relatively sharp and clean interface is observed between smfeas(o , f ) and caf@xmath4 substrate , as shown in fig.[fig : figure1]d .",
    "furthermore , smfeas(o , f ) layers contained neither correlated defects nor large angle grain boundaries ( gbs ) .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature @xmath17 defined as 90% of the normal state resistivity is 54.2k in zero magnetic field .",
    "figures[fig : figure2]a and [ fig : figure2]b show the arrhenius plots of resistivity for both crystallographic directions measured in static fields up to 45 t . for both directions",
    "the @xmath17 is shifted to lower temperature with increasing @xmath18 , as shown in the inset of fig.[fig : figure2]b .",
    "the respective @xmath17 at 45 t for @xmath19 and @xmath20 are 44.9k and 49.9k .",
    "significant broadening of the transition is observed for @xmath19 , which is reminiscent of high-@xmath2 cuprates .",
    "such broadening of the transition originates from enhanced thermally activated vortex motion for @xmath19 .",
    "in contrast , the in - field @xmath17 as well as its transition width for @xmath21 are less affected by @xmath18 than that for @xmath19 .",
    "the activation energy @xmath22 for vortex motion can be estimated by the model of thermally activated flux flow@xcite . on the assumption that @xmath23 , we obtain @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the prefactor . in figs.[fig : figure2]a and [ fig : figure2]b , the slope of linear fits corresponds to the @xmath27 for vortex motion .",
    "figure[fig : figure2]c shows @xmath27 as a function of @xmath18 for both major directions . it can be seen that @xmath22 shows a power law [ i.e. , @xmath28 for both crystallographic directions . in the range of @xmath29 t",
    ", @xmath30 is observed for @xmath19 , whilst a similar field dependence of @xmath22 reaches 20 t for @xmath21 . in higher fields",
    "@xmath27 for @xmath21 shows a weak @xmath18 dependence . on the other hand , @xmath31 is obtained for @xmath19 in the range of @xmath32 t , which is close to 1 , suggesting a crossover from plastic to collective pinning at around @xmath33t@xcite .",
    "figure[fig : figure2]d shows the relationship between @xmath34 and @xmath27 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the linear fitting for @xmath19 yields @xmath35k , whilst the corresponding value for @xmath21 is @xmath36k .",
    "both @xmath2 values are equal within error and close to @xmath17 .",
    "this perfect linear scaling is due to the correct assumption that both @xmath23 and @xmath37 conditions are satisfied in a wide temperature range in figs.[fig : figure2]a and [ fig : figure2]b .",
    "the field dependence of @xmath5 at 4.2k for both principal crystallographic directions measured up to 45 t is displayed in fig.[fig : figure3]a .",
    "@xmath5 for @xmath19 ( @xmath38 ) is lower than that for @xmath21 ( @xmath39 ) , which is a consequence of moderate anisotropy of smfeas(o ,",
    "this tendency is observed for all temperature regions ( see supplementary fig.s2 ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a @xmath38 of over 10@xmath0a/@xmath1 was recorded even at 45 t , which is favourable for high - field magnet applications .",
    "@xmath39 is observed to decrease gradually with @xmath18 and it shows an almost constant value of @xmath40a/@xmath1 for @xmath41 t .",
    "this behaviour can be explained by a combination of extrinsic ( i.e. , normal precipitates and stacking faults ) and intrinsic pinning , which is a similar observation in quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) system yba@xmath4cu@xmath16o@xmath42 [ i.e. , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the out - of - plane superconducting coherence length at zero temperature and @xmath45 is the interlayer distance between cuo@xmath4 planes]@xcite .",
    "smfeas(o , f ) is an alternating structure of smo and feas layers , similarly to high-@xmath2 cuprates .",
    "additionally , @xmath44 is shorter than the interlayer distance between fe - as planes @xmath14 .",
    "hence , modulation of superconducting order parameter along the crystallographic @xmath46-axis ( i.e. , intrinsic pinning ) is highly expected in smfeas(o , f ) . in fact",
    "the extrinsic pinning is dominant up to 28 t , whereas the intrinsic pinning overcomes the extrinsic one above 28 t .",
    "the estimation of @xmath44 and @xmath14 in our smfeas(o , f ) case will be discussed later .    by analysing the @xmath47-@xmath48 curves from which @xmath5 was determined",
    ", we obtain the information on the pinning potential . on the assumption of a logarithmic current dependence of the pinning potential @xmath49 for homogeneous samples ,",
    "@xmath47-@xmath48 curves show a power - law relation @xmath47@xmath50@xmath51 ( @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the boltzmann constant)@xcite .",
    "hence @xmath5 scales with @xmath54 and indeed the field dependence of @xmath54 has a similar behaviour to @xmath55 for @xmath19 , as presented in fig.[fig : figure3]b . for @xmath21 ,",
    "@xmath54 decreases with @xmath18 up to 28 t , similarly to the @xmath55 behaviour , whereas at larger field it suddenly increases due to the dominating intrinsic pinning .",
    "hence a failure to scale @xmath5 with @xmath54 or deviations as shown in fig.[fig : figure3]c indicates the presence of intrinsic pinning .",
    "the field dependence of the pinning force density @xmath56 for both crystallographic directions at 4.2k is summarised in fig.[fig : figure3]d .",
    "an almost field independent @xmath56 above 10 t for @xmath19 is observed , whereas @xmath56 for @xmath21 is still increasing up to the maximum field available .      in order to gain a deeper insight into the flux pinning , the angular dependence of @xmath5 [ @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the angle between @xmath18 and the @xmath46-axis ] was measured and summarised in fig.[fig : figure4 ] .",
    "figure[fig : figure4]a presents @xmath57 at 30k in three different magnetic fields .",
    "almost isotropic @xmath59 of around 0.14 ma/@xmath1 was observed at angles @xmath58 up to @xmath60 .",
    "similar isotropic behaviour is seen at 6 t .",
    "these results suggest the presence of @xmath46-axis correlated defects .",
    "however , the presence of these defects is ruled out by tem investigation , since only relatively large fef@xmath4 particles are observed in the smfeas(o , f ) matrix .",
    "recently , van der beek @xmath6 @xmath7 . pointed out that defects of size larger than the out - of - plane coherence length contribute to @xmath46-axis pinning in anisotropic superconductors@xcite .",
    "additionally , the intrinsic pinning is active below @xmath61k , as shown below .",
    "hence the combination of large particles and the intrinsic pinning may be responsible for this isotropic @xmath57 .    for @xmath21 , a broad maximum of @xmath5 is observed and this peak becomes sharper with increasing @xmath18 ( fig.[fig : figure4]a ) .",
    "however , the corresponding @xmath54 shows a broad minimum for @xmath18 close to @xmath12 direction ( fig.[fig : figure4]b ) , which is opposite behaviour to @xmath5 .",
    "this is due to the thermal fluctuation of josephson vortices , which leads to flux creep . here , the flux creep rate @xmath62 and the exponent @xmath54 are related as @xmath63@xcite . when the applied field is close to the @xmath12-plane ,",
    "a number of thermally fluctuated josephson vortices are generated , leading to an increase in @xmath64 .",
    "this could quantitatively explain a dip of @xmath54 at around @xmath18 close to @xmath12 .",
    "similar behaviour has been observed in yba@xmath4cu@xmath16o@xmath42 thin films@xcite and fe(se , te ) thin films@xcite . on the other hand , this dip of @xmath54 disappears at 40k , although the @xmath5 still shows a broad maximum ( figs.[fig : figure4]c and [ fig : figure4]d ) .",
    "hence the activation temperature of the intrinsic pinning is between 30 and 40k , which is in good agreement with the transition temperature between abrikosov- and josephson - like vortices in smfeas(o , f ) single crystals@xcite .",
    "figure[fig : figure4]e shows @xmath57 measured at 4.2k in fields up to 40 t .",
    "a sharp peak is observed for @xmath21 with a @xmath5 of around of @xmath65a/@xmath1 . for 2d superconductors ( e.g. , bi@xmath4sr@xmath4cacu@xmath4o@xmath66 )",
    ", the relation @xmath67 holds in the intrinsic pinning regime , whereas @xmath39 is field independent@xcite .",
    "thus , in this regime @xmath68 depends only on the field component along the @xmath46-axis . for our smfeas(o , f ) thin film , the aforementioned condition is satisfied above 28 t at which the crossover field between extrinsic and intrinsic pinning is observed ( see fig.[fig : figure3]a ) . hence , for @xmath69 ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) the @xmath12 component of the applied fields",
    "exceed 28 t , entering in the field - independent @xmath39 region .",
    "it means that both angular@xmath5 curves measured at 32.5 and 40 t rescale with @xmath72 , as shown in fig.[fig : figure4]f .",
    "we estimate the @xmath44 by using @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the dimensional crossover temperature and @xmath75 is the dimensionless ratio characterising the crossover from quasi-2d layered to continuous 3d anisotropic behaviour@xcite . by substituting @xmath76k and @xmath77 nm from the x - ray diffraction shown in supplementary fig.s1 , @xmath78",
    "is calculated to 0.3@xmath500.4 nm .",
    "the ratio @xmath79 explains the intrinsic pinning related to a quasi 2d system observed in this film .",
    "the relation @xmath80 yields @xmath81 nm , where @xmath82 is the effective - mass or resistivity anisotropy , which is about 30 at @xmath83k from measurements of the @xmath46-axis plasma frequency using infrared ellipsometry@xcite .",
    "the evaluated superconducting coherence lengths for both crystallographic directions are in very good agreement with single - crystals values reported by welp @xmath6 @xmath7@xcite .",
    "the presence of a dimensional crossover indicates a possible intrinsic josephson junction in smfeas(o , f ) , which can be used in superconducting electronics applications such as a terahertz radiation source and a superconducting qubit@xcite .",
    "indeed , the intrinsic josephson junction was reported for a prfeaso@xmath84 single crystal , where an @xmath85-shaped stack junction in @xmath46-direction was prepared by focused ion beam@xcite .    for high - field magnet applications ,",
    "a high @xmath5 together with a low @xmath5 anisotropy ( @xmath86 ) in the presence of magnetic field is necessary .",
    "the present results are promising , since @xmath5 is over 10@xmath0a/@xmath1 at 45 t for both crystallographic directions .",
    "further increasing in @xmath5 is possible , since the only appreciable defects in our smfeas(o , f ) films are large fef@xmath4 particles . improved pinning performance and , as a consequence , larger @xmath5 could be realised by incorporating artificial pinning centres similarly to co - doped ba-122 thin films reported by tarantini @xmath6 @xmath7@xcite .",
    "albeit the @xmath5 anisotropy is increasing with @xmath18 , this value is still low compared to high-@xmath2 cuprtaes .",
    "for instance , @xmath5 anisotropy is about 3.6 at 30 t and 4.2k in smfeas(o , f ) , whereas the corresponding value in yba@xmath4cu@xmath16o@xmath42 is over 7 , albeit the latter shows higher @xmath5 than the former@xcite .",
    "pit is a more realistic process than mbe for high - field magnet applications .",
    "high temperature heat treatment in pit leads to a loss of f , however , this problem can be solved by employing a low temperature synthesis and ex - situ process with smf@xmath16 containing binder as explained in refs.@xcite . despite a high @xmath2 of over 45k for both smfeas(o , f ) wires ,",
    "self - field @xmath5 shows only a few thousand a/@xmath1 at 4.2k , which is presumably due to grain boundaries ( gbs ) , poor grain connectivity and low density .",
    "obviously these pit processed wires contain a high density of large angle gbs . in the case of co - doped ba-122 gbs with misorientation angles above 9@xmath15 seriously reduce the critical current .",
    "however , pit processed k - doped ba-122 and sr-122 wires showed a relatively high inter - grain @xmath5@xcite .",
    "clean gbs ( i.e. , no segregation of secondary phases around gbs ) , good grain connectivity and a low anisotropy may be responsible for these high performance wires .",
    "an approach similar to the one employed in k - doped ba-122 and sr-122 wires fabrication may be useful for improving inter - grain @xmath5 in smfeas(o , f ) wires as well .",
    "nevertheless bicrystal experiments on smfeas(o , f ) will give a valuable information on these issues .",
    "to conclude , we have explored intrinsic electro - magnetic properties of epitaxial smfeas(o , f ) thin films prepared by mbe on caf@xmath4 ( 001 ) substrate by measuring field - angular dependence of transport properties up to 45 t .",
    "our findings strongly support the presence of a competition behaviour between extrinsic pinning below 28 t and intrinsic pinning above 28 t .",
    "we also determined that the intrinsic pinning starts being effective below @xmath61k , at which the crossover between the out - of - plane coherence length and the interlayer distance occurs .",
    "this knowledge of smfeas(o , f ) electro - magnetic properties could stimulate future development of superconducting applications of this class of material .",
    "smfeas(o , f ) films of 80 nm thickness have been grown in the customer - designed mbe chamber . a parent compound of smfeaso film was prepared on caf@xmath4 ( 001 ) single crystalline substrate at 650@xmath15c , followed by the deposition of a smf@xmath16 cap layer . empirically , fe - rich pnictide films fabricated by mbe showed high @xmath5 values@xcite .",
    "hence a slight fe excess was supplied during the growth of smfeaso layers .",
    "after the overlayer deposition , the sample was kept at the same temperature in the mbe chamber for 0.5 h for the purpose of f diffusion into the smfeaso layer .",
    "the detailed fabrication process can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "smfeas(o , f ) films are grown epitaxially with high crystalline quality confirmed by x - ray diffraction , which is summarised in supplementary fig.s1 .",
    "a tem lamella was prepared by means of focused ion beam .",
    "microstructural analyses have been performed by using a jeol tem-2100f transmission electron microscope equipped with an energy - dispersive x - ray spectrometer .      a small bridge of 70@xmath87 m width and 0.7 mm length was fabricated by laser cutting .",
    "@xmath88-@xmath89 characteristics on this sample were measured with four - probe configuration by a commercial physical property measurement system [ ( ppms ) quantum design ] up to 12 t .",
    "transport measurements up to 45 t were carried out in the high field dc facility at the national high magnetic field laboratory ( nhmfl ) in tallahassee , fl .",
    "a voltage criterion of 1@xmath90 was employed for evaluating @xmath5 .",
