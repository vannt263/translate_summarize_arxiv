    "points of stellar evolution , they shape the energy and chemistry evolution of galaxies and have been successfully used as distance indicators up to redshifts of @xmath2 thanks to an empirical decline rate  luminosity relation @xcite .",
    "this relationship led to the discovery of the acceleration of the universe @xcite    the exact nature of sn ia progenitors is still debated , but most models involve an accreting carbon  oxygen white dwarf ( co wds ) with a mass close to the chandrasekhar mass @xcite .",
    "this co wd would accrete mass from either a slightly evolved main sequence companion ( co wd + ms ) , a more evolved red giant star ( co wd + rg ) , or a helium star ( co wd + he ) , in the so  called _ single degenerate _ scenarios , or as a result of the merger of two degenerate stars with a combined mass above the chandrasekhar limit , in the _ double degenerate",
    "_ scenario ( _ dd _ , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has been suggested that only co wds accreting within a narrow range lead to successful thermonuclear explosions ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , unless additional physical processes are included in the models , e.g. rotation and other three  dimensional effects ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the diversity of sn ia ejecta and the origin of the decline rate  absolute magnitude relation are being understood only recently thanks to new observational techniques and energy transfer codes ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these efforts have been accompanied by new developments in the physics of the explosion which have shown that even if pure deflagration models can reproduce many sn ia spectra and light curves @xcite , in some cases a delayed detonation may be necessary .",
    "the physics of both the transition to detonation and ignition of the deflagration wave remain uncertain .",
    "a related problem , rarely addressed in the literature , is how to connect theoretical models with observed systematic differences between sne ia occurring in different stellar environments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these should be related to the pre  supernova evolution and not to line  of  sight effects or other processes occuring randomly during the explosion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , presupernova evolution must play a significant role in the diversity of sn ia explosions @xcite .      here",
    "we will assume that the progenitors of sne ia originate in the sd scenario ; but note that , even in the standard dd scenario , the core would evolve in a very similar way in the immediate pre - explosion phase ( i.e. during the last @xmath3yr ; see * ? ? ? * ) .    before a sn ia progenitor becomes unbound by the explosion it undergoes several distinct phases of evolution @xcite .",
    "first , the progenitor white dwarf cools down at almost constant density after its birth , for a period of hundreds or thousands of myr , depending on the particular formation scenario ( the _ cooling phase _ ) .",
    "then , it accretes matter for a period of the order of one myr , making the degenerate star shrink to keep the hydrostatic equilibrium and its core compress adiabatically , the _ accretion phase_. adiabatic compression at the center and heat diffusion from the hot accreting envelope can make the central temperature increase under degenerate conditions , triggering hydrostatic carbon burning and a new source of energy generation .",
    "the energy input from hydrostatic carbon burning will force the star to transport the excess energy at its center convectively , the _ simmering phase_. during this phase the convective core can grow to engulf most of the star . if the central density is high enough , @xmath0captures and @xmath1decays can become important . in the presence of a convective core",
    ", that process has been called the _ convective urca process_.    at some point energy deposition will dominate over the energy losses , making the star s central temperature increase at almost constant density , the _ thermonuclear flash_. finally , when the temperature is high enough , one or more ignition spots will give rise to nuclear flames that will propagate in the highly convective medium , the _ thermonuclear runaway _ , causing a deflagration wave to sweep over the star , sometimes transitioning into a detonation wave .",
    "the deflagration and detonation waves will generate most of the kinetic energy and ashes in the ejecta in a few seconds , including radioactive matter which will later power the light curve of the supernova .",
    "since this last phase will occur at very high temperatures , the characteristic burning time ",
    "scales will be much shorter than the typical weak interaction time  scales and the neutron excess of the ejecta will not differ from that of the presupernova star , except for the star s innermost regions where weak interaction time ",
    "scales are shorter",
    ". most of the wd s neutron excess changes will occur before ignition .",
    "one of the main obstacles that remain to be solved in order to obtain self  consistent pre ",
    "supernova models up to ignition is the _ convective urca process _",
    ", which was mentioned in the previous section .",
    "the following factors make this phase of evolution difficult to solve : ( 1 ) the appearance of a fast  growing convective core with a very steep luminosity and composition gradient at its outer edge , the so  called c  flash ; ( 2 ) a high  density medium with @xmath0capture and @xmath1decay time",
    " scales similar to the convective time  scales , which have an uncertain effect over the energy budget of the star ; ( 3 ) a steep density gradient which changes rapidly when the wd approaches the chandrasekhar mass ; ( 4 ) a steep composition gradient of the urca pair @xmath4@xmath5 at the threshold density for electron captures , which moves inwards as the central density increases and ( 5 ) an increasingly complex set of nuclear reactions as carbon burns and pollutes the wd with its ashes , with a time  scale that can be similar to @xmath0capture and @xmath1decay time  scales    it is not clear whether @xmath0captures and @xmath1decays of urca matter around a threshold density in a convective medium have a cooling or heating effect over time .",
    "many studies over the years have reached different conclusions regarding this point .",
    "@xcite first suggested that urca processes have a stabilizing effect over carbon burning , leading to the formation of a neutron star instead of a thermonuclear explosion .",
    "@xcite realized that @xmath0captures can cause heating by creating holes in the fermi sea , which dominate over the neutrino losses for the most important urca pairs .",
    "@xcite found that significant work must be done to mantain convection when urca processes occur , with a net cooling effect , but pointed out that convection can not develop fast enough to prevent heating .",
    "@xcite summarized the factors controlling the urca process , but it was later shown that the role of the kinetic energy flux should have been included in their analysis .",
    "more recently , @xcite showed that the heating effect of the urca process depends on the state of mixing of the convective core , that the convective velocities are reduced by urca processes and that time ",
    "dependent computations with a full nuclear network are needed to understand the effect of urca processes on the ignition conditions of sne ia .    in this study",
    "we have focused on how to accurately treat the increasingly complex nuclear reactions as the wd is polluted with ashes .",
    "we do not attempt to answer whether urca processes cause cooling or heating , but provide a tool for better evaluating the competing heating and cooling mechanisms in a presupernova wd approaching ignition .    in what follows",
    "we will introduce two approximations that use a limited number of nuclei to accurately describe the evolution of the main species that result from the burning of @xmath6 , the energy deposition rate , the energy losses via neutrinos and the neutron excess .",
    "we will show when these approximations hold , and their potential applications , but first we will introduce a detailed nuclear network which will be used for comparison with the simplified networks .",
    "k. ]    the nuclear reactions within a co wd approaching explosion are characterized by the burning of @xmath6 nuclei at high densities ( @xmath7 g @xmath8 ) and high temperatures ( @xmath9 k ) in an environment rich in @xmath6 and @xmath10 nuclei and relatively devoid of free protons , @xmath11particles or neutrons .",
    "the dominant reactions are @xmath12 , q = 4.6 mev , and @xmath13 , q = 2.2 mev , both occurring at similar rates ( see figure  [ fig : comparison_12c ] ) .",
    "the nuclear network increases in complexity as the @xmath6burning pollutes the wd with its ashes , mainly @xmath14 and @xmath4 , but also with protons and @xmath11particles , which will be processed into additional @xmath10 and @xmath15 nuclei , as will be shown later .",
    "we have integrated a detailed reaction network at fixed temperature and density compiled by the authors .",
    "the system of differential equations defining the network is solved for using the semi  implicit extrapolation method from @xcite .",
    "we include species that are part of the reactions known to be most important , or those close to them in a table of nuclides .",
    "we include all reaction rates between species of our network that are either in the reaclib library @xcite , or in the weak interaction tables by @xcite , as well as improved @xmath16 rates from @xcite .",
    "screening corrections were also included under the simplification of @xcite .",
    "recent formalisms that treat carbon burning and screening corrections in alternative ways were not implemented for this work ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have assumed that the initial c / o ratio is always given by the nuclide mass fractions x(@xmath6 ) = 0.3 and x(@xmath10 ) = 0.7 , in order to compare with the work by @xcite , but reasonable variations of the initial compositions do not affect the validity of our approximations .",
    "figure  [ fig : chap04_flows3e8_0p04_co ] show the main flows in our nuclear network at a temperature of @xmath17 k and densities of @xmath18 g @xmath8 ( top ) and @xmath19 g @xmath8 ( bottom ) , starting from a pure carbon ",
    "oxygen mixture , when 20% of the original carbon nuclei have been burnt .",
    "the left hand side color  coding bar indicates the mole fraction scale of the individual species , whereas the right hand side color  coding bar indicates the mole fraction flow scale of the individual reactions .",
    "only reactions that are bigger than one thousandth of the biggest flow are plotted .",
    "the main differences between the low density ( top ) and high density ( bottom ) flow diagrams are due to @xmath0captures in the @xmath20na(e@xmath21 , @xmath22)@xmath20ne reaction , which only occurs at densities higher than @xmath231.7@xmath24 g @xmath8 . below this density",
    "the @xmath0captures are almost exclusively due to the @xmath16 reaction .",
    "the advantage of this detailed network is that it can accurately track the evolution of nuclei with a wide range of characteristic time  scales .",
    "for example , it is capable of accurately following the mole fraction of @xmath11particles , protons , neutrons or fast electron  capturing @xmath25 nuclei , as well as long characteristic time ",
    "scale nuclei like @xmath6 , or intermediate time ",
    "scale nuclei like @xmath4 at high densities .",
    "since we study this reaction network in convective wd interiors , we must consider the relation between the relevant burning time  scales and the convective turn  over time  scale , which is determined by the diffusion time  scale and the temperature , density and composition gradients of the star .",
    "the convective time ",
    "scale will be the shortest time ",
    "scale that affects the evolution of the structure of the star that is not directly connected to the nuclear physics , and can be as low as 50 sec before ignition ( see figure  6 in * ? ? ?",
    "ideally , we would like to build an approximated nuclear network where we remove time  scales much shorter than the convective time ",
    "scale from the resulting set of differential equations , as long as a reasonable physical justification is provided .",
    "this would reduce the number of variables per zone while keeping accuracy and would make the inversion of the corresponding jacobian in a newton  raphson integration scheme more stable .",
    "we have found two approximate solutions that achieve the former based on the detailed nuclear network at fixed density and temperature described in this section ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the first such approximation will be described in the following section .",
    "to accurately follow the chemistry of the evolving wd progenitor towards explosion , the simultaneous solution of the structure and chemistry of the star is required @xcite .",
    "the chemistry equations must be able to reproduce the evolution of the main species and their effect on the star through changes in energy deposition , energy losses or the electron fraction .",
    "this can become computationally demanding if too many species are included and can worsen during the _ simmering phase _ of evolution due to known convergence problems @xcite , even with approximate theories of convection .",
    "we have found a first order approximation to the full nuclear network which will be described in this section .",
    "we will refer to this approximation as n1 .",
    "a more accurate version of this approximation , n2 , will be described in section  [ sec:2ndapprox ] .",
    "both simplified networks use the fact that the dominant carbon burning reactions , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , occur nearly at the same rate and the abundances of protons , @xmath11particles , neutrons and @xmath25 nuclei are approximately at equilibrium most of the time .",
    "this can be explained by the complementarity of the relevant reactions ( see figure  [ fig : treec12low ] and [ fig : treec12high ] ) , which was first noticed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "first , when in the carbon burning reaction @xmath28 a proton is released , it will be captured quickly , preferentially in the @xmath29 reaction .",
    "second , @xmath25 will quickly capture an electron in the @xmath16 reaction , decreasing the pressure and lifting the degeneracy of the gas , and producing a @xmath15 nucleus .",
    "third , in the carbon burning reaction @xmath27 an @xmath11particle will be released and quickly captured in the @xmath30 reaction , thus consuming the @xmath15 nucleus just produced , but liberating a neutron .",
    "fourth , the free neutron will be preferentially captured in the @xmath31 reaction , thus recovering the @xmath15 just consumed .",
    "hence , the net effect is approximately the burning of six @xmath6 nuclei and the capture of one electron to be replaced by four nuclei : @xmath14 , @xmath4 , @xmath10 and @xmath15 , i.e. : @xmath32 an additional @xmath0capture can occur via the @xmath33 reaction if the density is above @xmath34 g @xmath8 . in this case",
    ", two @xmath0captures can occur and the net effect is : @xmath35 which is schematically shown in figure  [ fig : treec12high ] . if any of the flows above is broken the simplified network will fail and will need a different treatment .",
    "now , we will assume that the only relevant reactions are :    [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < , < , < , < \" , ]     this list includes proton  leak reactions ( 9 , 10 , 11 , 17 and 18 ) , neutron  leak reactions ( 12 , 13 and 16 ) , and @xmath11leak reactions ( 14 , 15 , 19 , 20 , 21 and 22 ) .",
    "leaks are the first to be significant as @xmath6 ashes are produced , but with more ashes produced neutron ",
    "leaks become relevant too .",
    "when this happens , @xmath15 is rapidly depleted and @xmath11leaks become important as well .    as can be seen from the reactions in the list",
    ", it would be necessary to increase the number of species to account for all proton , neutron and @xmath11leaks exactly . to do this",
    "we can either account for @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 independently , or we can group some or all of them into an auxiliary variable . since reactions 16 ) and 18 )",
    "depend on the abundance of @xmath37 nuclei , we solve for @xmath37 independently and group @xmath36 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 into a dummy _ leak _ species .",
    "thus , while keeping the number of independent variables small and ensuring mass conservation , we can introduce @xmath43 as the mole fraction of a dummy nuclei that represents leaks on @xmath36 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we assume that this dummy species has approximately the average mass number of the species it represents , defining it as : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the mass number of the respective species and the sum is made over @xmath6 , @xmath15 , @xmath25 , @xmath10 , @xmath14 , @xmath37 , @xmath5 and @xmath4 . since the leak nuclei @xmath36 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 can subsequently capture neutrons with a cross  sections similar to that of @xmath14 , for simplicity we will assume that leak nuclei capture neutrons with the @xmath14 cross  section .",
    "the energy generation rate can be obtained after a straightforward modification of the individual terms above , noting that the combined energy contribution of the inverse reaction @xmath62 and the reaction @xmath29 can be obtained simply by multiplying the q  value of reaction 3 ) to the associated term in the r.h.s . of equation  ( [ eq : c12new ] ) .",
    "in what follows we will compare the results of the full nuclear network introduced in section  [ sec : full ] with those of the simplified nuclear networks n1 and n2 introduced in sections  [ sec:1stapprox ] and [ sec:2ndapprox ] .",
    "we will compare the evolution of the main and trace nuclei mole fractions , the time evolution and the energy release in the form of photons or neutrinos as a function of the fraction of burnt @xmath6 nuclei .    in most examples",
    "we have chosen a temperature of @xmath63 k and a density of @xmath64 g @xmath8 , which are typical of the conditions encountered during the thermonuclear runaway and before ignition in a pre  supernova co wd .",
    "we chose a temperature and density at which the simplified solution errors would be representative of those encountered at other temperatures and densities after the trace nuclei have reached their equilibrium values . the time ",
    "scales for the trace nuclei to reach their equilibrium values can be computed from equations  ( [ eq : approx_tau ] ) .",
    "mole fraction changes vs the fraction of burnt @xmath6 in the full and n1 networks .",
    "main ashes and the neutron excess change are shown as continuous ( full network ) or dot  dashed ( n1 ) lines and trace nuclei are shown as dashed ( full network ) or dotted ( n1 ) lines .",
    "see discussion in the text . ]    , but using the network n2 as comparison .",
    "we also include the mole fraction changes of @xmath37 and the dummy leak particles introduced in equation  ( [ eq : yl ] ) .",
    "note that the trace nuclei follow their equilibrium values precisely under this approximation .",
    "the abundance of leak nuclei is only well matched when more than @xmath65 1% of the @xmath6 is burnt . ]    in figures  [ fig : yevol_4e83e9_n_co ] and [ fig : yevol_4e83e9_n_co_n2 ] we show the ratio between the @xmath6 ashes and @xmath6 mole fraction changes vs the fraction of burnt @xmath6 , as well as the ratio between the neutron excess change and the @xmath6 mole fraction change vs the fraction of burnt @xmath6 .",
    "we compare the integration of the full network with that of the networks n1 and",
    "n2 , respectively . the transformation was chosen because it makes the evolution of @xmath15 , @xmath10 and @xmath14 look exactly flat under n1 , according to equations  ( [ eq : dc13c12 ] ) , ( [ eq : do16c12 ] ) and ( [ eq : dne20c12 ] ) , allowing an easier comparison between the integrations of n1 and n2 .    it can be seen that once the slowest evolving trace nuclei reach their equilibrium value and before about 1% of the @xmath6 has been burnt , both plots show a good agreement between the simplified and full networks for the main @xmath6 ashes .",
    "the exceptions are @xmath11particles , @xmath10 and @xmath14 under n1 due to the initial @xmath11leaks from reaction 15 ) and because we have assumed a pure co mixture , with @xmath15 initially absent . since in this example the @xmath4 @xmath0capture time ",
    "scale is shorter than the @xmath5 @xmath1decay time ",
    "scale , both simplified solutions correctly predict a higher abundance for @xmath5 once both time  scales become comparable .",
    "both solutions show a good match for the neutron excess changes too .    however , once the fraction of burnt @xmath6 is above @xmath66% , the trace nuclei equilibrium abundances of n1 begin to differ from the exact solution , whereas n2 matches their values even when more than half of the original @xmath6 has been burnt .",
    "the inclusion of the leak reactions in n2 provides a better match for the trace nuclei and as a consequence , the main @xmath6 ashes as well , once the trace nuclei equilibrium mole fractions have been reached .",
    "note also that the @xmath11particle , @xmath10 and @xmath14 mole fraction changes are well matched in n2 once trace nuclei equilibrium is reached .",
    "in n2 the trace nuclei follow precisely their equilibrium values as @xmath6 burns , even if these equilibrium values change dramatically .",
    "this is because their characteristic time ",
    "scales are much smaller than the characteristic @xmath6 burning time  scale .",
    "this supports the use of n2 in a varying temperature and density integration , which would be analogous to changing the equilibrium values of the trace nuclei as @xmath6 burns . the shortest time ",
    "scale for the environment s variables to change should be bigger than the biggest trace nuclei time  scale .",
    "mole fraction changes vs the fraction of burnt @xmath6 in the full ( continuous ) and n2 ( dot  dashed ) networks .",
    "note that in n1 the evolution of the species @xmath15 , @xmath10 and @xmath14 should be exactly flat in this plot according to equations  ( [ eq : dc13c12 ] ) , ( [ eq : do16c12 ] ) and ( [ eq : dne20c12 ] ) . generally speaking",
    ", n2 reproduces the full network abundances to the 5% level when the trace nuclei have reached their equilibrium mole fractions . in numerical experiments ,",
    "n2 loses its accuracy when both @xmath50 and @xmath52 ( see equations  [ eq : fp ] and [ eq : fn ] ) are lower than 0.5 , which is due to the observed @xmath15 depletion . ]    in figure  [ fig : yevol_4e83e9_co ] we show an enlarged section of figure  [ fig : yevol_4e83e9_n_co_n2 ] .",
    "if n1 were valid , the evolution of @xmath10 and @xmath14 would look flat and approximately 0.19 in this space . the same would be the case for @xmath15 , although approximately 0.15 ( see equations  [ eq : dc13c12 ] , [ eq : do16c12 ] and [ eq : dne20c12 ] ) .",
    "this is only approximately true when the fraction of burnt @xmath6 is between 2% and 5% .",
    "since we plot absolute values of mole fraction changes , figure  [ fig : yevol_4e83e9_co ] does not show whether the @xmath10 mole fraction is decreased or increased .",
    "in fact , its mole fraction is originally depleted and , only after the fraction of burnt @xmath6 is about @xmath67 , it is increased .",
    "the original depletion is caused by @xmath11leaks in reaction 15 ) , which increase the mole fraction of @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath5 mole fraction is larger than the @xmath5 mole fraction only after the burnt fraction of @xmath6 is about @xmath68 .",
    "interestingly , this makes the neutron excess evolution change from above @xmath69 to @xmath70 in this transformation .",
    "this can be understood noticing that @xmath71 and that the value shown in equation  ( [ eq : dyec12 ] ) is expected to double at high density .",
    "note that @xmath15 is depleted as @xmath37 and leak nuclei increase their abundance .",
    "this is because neutron leaks shortcut @xmath15 neutron captures , as discussed before .",
    "when this happens , @xmath52 decreases dramatically ( see equation  [ eq : falpha ] ) , and the accuracy of the approximation is lost to about 20% level .",
    "although at the beginning of the integration @xmath52 is also small , n2 matches the full network with great accuracy . to distinguish between the cases when the accuracy of n2 is very good and",
    "only a small fraction of @xmath6 has been burnt from the late loss of accuracy with a big fraction of @xmath6 burnt , we define the criterion for n2 to be considered an accurate representation of the full network as @xmath72 which should be used in a varying temperature and density integration , such as in real stellar evolution models .    in figure  [",
    "fig : yevol_4e81e9_co ] we show a similar integration as in figure  [ fig : yevol_4e83e9_co ] , but at a density of @xmath73 g @xmath8 .",
    "we can see that @xmath15 is depleted at a smaller fraction of @xmath6 than in figure  [ fig : yevol_4e83e9_co ] .",
    "this is because there are more leak nuclei to capture neutrons .",
    "the same associated loss of accuracy after @xmath15 depletion is observed .",
    "we can also see that the neutron excess evolution is closer to 0.3 in this figure , as expected from equation  ( [ eq : dyec12 ] ) .",
    "however , as @xmath15 is depleted , the e@xmath21capture rate decreases accordingly and the neutron excess evolution becomes slower .    finally , note that although by introducing the dummy leak nuclei we can keep the number of independent variables small , we will necessarily lose some accuracy matching the neutron excess .",
    "many leak nuclei can capture protons , neutrons or @xmath11particles , but they can also capture electrons like @xmath4 does .",
    "electron captures on free protons were found to be negligible . in order of increasing density , or fermi electron energy ,",
    "the following reactions may compete with proton , neutron and @xmath11captures :  @xmath74 ,  @xmath75 ,  @xmath76 ,  @xmath77  or @xmath78 , affecting the neutron excess evolution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it is not possible to model the former electron captures accurately without solving for each leak species and its electron capture counterpart independently .",
    "moreover , the relative abundances of the different leak species will depend on the temperature and density history of the gas , which makes it very difficult to compute the contribution of the different electron capture reactions knowing only @xmath43 .",
    "however , assuming that the excess of neutrons over protons of the leak nuclei is 1.5 under n2 , a 10% or 20% accuracy for the neutron excess evolution was achieved before and after @xmath15 depletion , respectively .",
    "this translates into a maximum of 5% or 10% error for the electron fraction , normally below 1% for small quantities of burnt @xmath6 .    , but changing the density to @xmath79 g @xmath8 .",
    "we can see that the network n2 loses its accuracy at a lower fraction of burnt @xmath6 , which is due to stronger neutron leaks which cause @xmath15 to be relatively depleted sooner . ]      in figure  [ fig : deltatime ] we show the ratio between the elapsed times of the simplified and full integrations vs the fraction of burnt @xmath6 .",
    "the n1 and n2 sub ",
    "scripts correspond to the solution of the first and second simplified networks , respectively .",
    "we can see that the n1 can over  estimate the speed at which @xmath6 burns by more than 20% , whereas the second simplified network reproduces the time evolution to better than 5% error .",
    "this is due to the absence of leak reactions in the first approximation , which over  estimates the amount of @xmath6 proton and neutron captures at a given time .    .",
    "n1 and n2 sub  scripts indicate which simplified network has been used for the comparison . ]    in figure  [ fig : deltaenergy ] we show the ratios between the photon and neutrino energy release rates in n1 and n2 and the photon and neutrino energy release rate in the full network .",
    "we can see that the photon energy release rates is typically off in n1 by 20% or more , whereas n2 matches them at the 5% level , except after @xmath15 is depleted .",
    "this is because the leak reactions tend to release more energy than the @xmath6 proton and neutron captures .",
    "the neutrino energy release rates are not as accurate because secondary electron captures not included in these networks can have an important contribution , but since photon energy rates are generally much bigger , the error in the net energy release remains at the 5% level .    , but we now show the ratios of the photon and neutrino energy release rates between the simplified and the full networks . n1 and",
    "n2 sub  scripts indicate which simplified network has been used for the comparison . ]",
    "we have derived two approximate nuclear networks that can be used in the hydrostatic carbon burning regime of carbon  oxygen white dwarfs ( co wds ) approaching ignition .",
    "the networks have the advantage of being able to track accurately the relevant species during this phase of evolution without having to include the fast  evolving protons , neutrons , @xmath11particles or @xmath25 nuclei .    using the same integration method @xcite , convergence tolerance and initial conditions in one  zone models , we have found that the integration of n1 or n2 is much faster than that of the detailed network . depending on the temperature , density and composition , the ratio between the integration times of the detailed network and n2 varied between a factor of a few and a factor of several hundreds .",
    "integration time ratios between n2 and n1 varied between 1.2 and 1.3 .",
    "note that the slowest step in the integration of full stellar evolution models is normally gaussian elimination or similar methods , which scale with the cube of the number of independent physical variables .",
    "thus , the simplified networks presented in this work could have important applications in full stellar evolution models .    depending on the amount of @xmath6 being burnt and the desired errors in the mole fractions of the dominant nuclei , the time and the net energy release , either the n1 or n2 approximations described in sections  [ sec:1stapprox ] and [ sec:2ndapprox ] could be used in co wd interiors . for an accuracy of the order of 50% , and to have a simple picture of the main flows involved , n1 can be used with caution . for an accuracy of the order of 5% ,",
    "n2 should be used instead . if n2 is used and the criterion in equation  ( [ eq : criterion ] ) does not hold , only an accuracy of the order of 20% can be guaranteed , as long as all the trace nuclei time ",
    "scales are much shorter than the @xmath6burning time  scale .    these accuracies are not valid for nuclei whose mole fractions are not significant , for example @xmath5 when the @xmath1decay time ",
    "scale is much shorter than the @xmath0capture time ",
    "scale , since in this case the @xmath80 reaction will dominate its evolution , a reaction that can not be included accurately under n2 .",
    "we have also found that for relatively low densities , below @xmath81 g @xmath8 , the quoted errors can double , but only when significant amounts of @xmath6 have been burnt , which normally occurs when the density is significantly above this number .",
    "thus , n2 is more accurate for central ignition models , but it could also be used in off  center ignition models .",
    "we have shown how to derive the approximations and have compared them to a detailed network at fixed temperature and density .",
    "we have also discussed how the approximations can break down and when they can be used . since all the details of the derivation are shown , these simplified networks can be further improved straightforwardly .",
    "it is also possible to build intermediate approximations between n1 and n2 , for example , including @xmath37 in the dummy leak species defined in equation  ( [ eq : yl ] ) to remove one independent variable from the solution .",
    "we have tested this last approximation in a few cases and the resulting errors appears to be twice the errors in n2 .",
    "although for simplicity we have only shown fixed temperature and density integrations , these approximations can be used in environments with varying temperature and density , such as real stellar evolution models .",
    "this is because in the temperature and density range found in pre  ignition wd interiors the trace nuclei reach their equilibrium values much faster than the typical environmental variables vary inside the star , even within strong pre  ignition convective velocity fields .",
    "the networks can account for @xmath4 or @xmath25 @xmath0captures for the purposes of following the evolution of the pressure  supporting electrons in pre ",
    "supernova wds .",
    "we have shown that they will be valid even in convective wd interiors .",
    "we recommend the use of these networks when the mass fractions of the most abundant species are relevant , namely @xmath6 , @xmath10 , @xmath15 , @xmath14 , @xmath5 or @xmath4 , or the electron mole fraction , @xmath82 , or the energy generation rates .",
    "we do not recommend its use if the abundances of other nuclei not included in this discussion are being studied .",
    "we have introduced an important tool to understand the effect of the _ convective urca process _ on the ignition conditions of sne ia .",
