    "the problem of determining if a balanced presentation of a group is geometric ( i.e. induced by a heegaard diagram of a closed orientable 3-manifold ) is quite important within geometric topology and has been deeply investigated by many authors ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) ; further , the connections between branched cyclic coverings of links and cyclic presentations of groups induced by suitable heegaard diagrams have been recently pointed out in several papers ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in order to investigate these connections , m.j .",

    "our main result is that each dunwoody manifold is a cyclic covering of a lens space ( eventually the 3-sphere ) , branched over a genus one 1-bridge knot . as a direct consequence ,",
