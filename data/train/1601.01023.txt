    "this work is primarily motivated by the study of social insects such as ants , honey bees , wasps and termites  @xcite but applies more generally to any population whose individuals have the ability to exchange information in order to get organized socially .",
    "more specifically , we are interested in the following two fundamental components of social insects colonies .    * communication system . *",
    "social insects are characterized by their well - developed communication system .",
    "for instance , ants communicate with each other using some pheromones that they most often leave on the soil surface to mark a trail leading from the colony to a food source . but",
    "pheromones are also used by ants to let other colony members know what task group they belong to .",
    "ants can also communicate by direct contact , using for instance their antennae .",
    "* division of labor . *",
    "the well - developed communication system of social insects is central to complex social behaviors , including division of labor  @xcite , i.e. , cooperative work .",
    "returning to the example of ants , except for the queens and reproductive males , the other individuals work together to create a favorable environment for the colony and the brood .",
    "the repertoire of tasks includes nest maintenance , foraging , brood care and nest defense , which have different costs . while some ants may specialize on a given task , which depends on their age class and morphology , most of the workers are totipotent  @xcite , meaning that they are able to perform all tasks and can therefore switch from one task to another in response to the need of the colony .    for a review on the various models of division of labor",
    ", we refer to  @xcite .",
    "there , the authors distinguish six classes of models : response threshold , integrated threshold - information transfer , self - reinforcement , foraging for work , social inhibition , and network task allocation models .",
    "these six different classes of models are built on six different assumptions about the causes of division of labor in social insects .",
    "the stochastic model introduced in this paper belongs to the last class of models : network task allocation models  @xcite .",
    "our objective is not to speculate on the communication system or on the division of labor in social insects , which is the work of experimental ecologists , but instead to understand how the communication system may affect the division of labor .",
    "more precisely , we think of the colony as being spread out on the vertex set of a graph representing a communication network in the sense that two individuals are given the opportunity to communicate if and only if the corresponding vertices are connected by an edge , and study the effects of the topology of the communication network on the division of labor .    to design such a network task allocation model , it is natural to use the mathematical framework of interacting particle systems  @xcite , which describe the interactions among particles or individuals located on a graph .",
    "the main objective of research in this field is to deduce the macroscopic behavior at the colony level that emerges from the microscopic rules at the individual level , which usually strongly depends on the topology of the network of interactions .",
    "one of the simplest and most popular example of interacting particle systems is the voter model , independently introduced in  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "individuals are characterized by their opinion that they update at rate one by imitating one of their neighbors chosen uniformly at random . to obtain a model for the dynamics of tasks , we think of each individual as being characterized by the task they are performing rather than their opinion , and use instead a variant of the much less popular anti - voter model  @xcite , also called the dissonant voting model , where individuals anti - imitate a neighbor chosen uniformly at random .",
    "the general idea is that individuals have no information about the overall division of labor beyond knowing which tasks their neighbors on the communication network are performing so , in order to balance the amount of energy spent in each task , they will try to perform a different task from their neighbors .",
    "though our model has some similarities with previous network task allocation models , this paper relies on analytical results rather than just simulations and is therefore more mathematical in spirit than previous works on this topic .",
    "to construct our model for the dynamics of tasks , we first let  @xmath0 be a graph representing a communication network .",
    "the colony is spread out on the vertex set of this graph , with exactly one individual at each of the vertices , and two individuals are given the opportunity to communicate if and only if there is an edge connecting the corresponding two vertices .",
    "individuals are characterized by the task they are performing , which they update at random times based on the information they get from their neighbors on the graph . for simplicity , we assume that the communication network is static , that there are only two tasks to be performed and that each individual is always performing exactly one task . as previously mentioned , it is natural to employ the framework of interacting particle systems in which we keep track of the task performed by each individual using a continuous - time markov chain whose state at time  @xmath1 is a configuration @xmath2 with  @xmath3 denoting the task performed at time  @xmath1 by the individual at vertex  @xmath4 .",
    "the evolution rules depend on a couple of parameters .",
    "first , we assume that performing task  @xmath5 has a cost  @xmath6 , which is included in the dynamics by interpreting the cost of a task as the rate at which an individual performing this task attempts to switch to the other task .",
    "we also assume that both tasks are equally important for the survival of the colony so , in the best case scenario , each time an individual communicates with a neighbor , it will cooperate by anti - imitating this neighbor in order to balance the amount of energy spent in each task .",
    "we consider an additional parameter  @xmath7 that we interpret as probability of defection and is included in the dynamics by assuming that , each time an individual wants to switch task ,    = 1.75em    with probability  @xmath7 , the individual defects by switching to the other task without communicating with any of its neighbors whereas    with probability  @xmath8 , the individual cooperates by communicating with a random neighbor and anti - imitating this neighbor .",
    "note that individuals with no neighbor have no other choice than always defecting due to their lack of knowledge . to describe the evolution",
    "rules formally , we let @xmath9 be the interaction neighborhood of vertex  @xmath4 and @xmath10 be the fraction of neighbors of vertex  @xmath4 that are performing task  @xmath5 when the system is in configuration  @xmath11 , which we assume to be zero when  @xmath4 has no neighbor . then , the transition rates at vertex  @xmath4 described above verbally can be written into equations as @xmath12 by our convention ( the fraction of neighbors is zero when there is no neighbor ) , when a vertex has no neighbor , it switches from task  @xmath5 to the other task at rate  @xmath13 in agreement with our verbal description of the model . note also that the anti - voter model  @xcite is simply obtained by setting  @xmath14 and  @xmath15 , though this special case is not of particular interest in our biological context .    *",
    "division of labor .",
    "* the main objective is to understand how the topology of the communication network affects the division of labor , which we model using the random variable @xmath16 the process  @xmath17 keeps track of the number of individuals performing task  1 at time  @xmath1 .",
    "we point out that this is not a markov process in general because the rate at which the number of individuals performing a given task varies depends on the specific location of these individuals on the communication network .",
    "the random variable  @xmath18 represents the fraction of time up to time  @xmath19 and averaged across all the colony task  1 has been performed .",
    "lemma  [ lem : general ] below will show that , at least when the defection probability is positive , this random variable converges almost surely to a limit that does not depend on the initial configuration of the system . under our assumption that both tasks are equally important for the survival of the colony",
    ", the division of labor is optimal when this limit is one half and poor when the limit is close to either zero or one .",
    "to fix the ideas , we assume from now on without loss of generality that the first task is the less costly therefore we have  @xmath20 . to start with a reference value ,",
    "assume that the communication network is completely disconnected , i.e. , there is no edge , meaning no communication . in this case , an individual performing task  @xmath5 switches to the other task at rate  @xmath13 so , by independence , @xmath21 almost surely for all  @xmath22 .",
    "note that the division of labor converges almost surely to the same limit  @xmath23 for all communication networks when the defection probability is equal to one , since in this case the individuals never communicate with their neighbors .",
    "looking now at more complex communication networks , figure  [ fig : frame ] shows the limit of the division of labor as a function of the defection probability obtained from numerical simulations of the process on each of the first three graphs of figure  [ fig : graphs ] but with one thousand instead of eight vertices like in the picture . as expected , the simulation results suggest that the division of labor gets improved , moving closer to one half , as the defection probability decreases and converges almost surely to the reference value  @xmath23 as the defection probability increases to one . in addition , at least for small defection probabilities , the division of labor is better for the process on large complete graphs than for the process on completely disconnected graphs .",
    "however , the simulation results also suggest something less obvious : the division of labor is much better on the one - dimensional torus where individuals can only communicate with their two nearest neighbors than on the complete graph where individuals can communicate with every other individual .",
    "this reveals a non - monotonic relationship between the number of connections and how well individuals organize themselves to accomplish both tasks equally , which we now prove analytically .        to begin with ,",
    "we give the exact limit of the division of labor for the process on complete graphs for all values of the defection probability .",
    "in particular , we obtain an explicit expression for the equation of the curve in solid line in figure  [ fig : frame ] .",
    "then , we give lower and upper bounds for the limit of the division of labor when the defection probability is small and for the process on bipartite graphs , which will also give a proof that the dashed curve in figure  [ fig : frame ] indeed starts at one half using that the ring with an even number of vertices is an example of a bipartite graph .",
    "finally , we will prove one more result for the process on the one - dimensional integer lattice to extend to infinite graphs the results obtained for finite bipartite graphs .",
    "* complete graphs . * to begin with , we examine the process on a complete graph .",
    "we recall that the complete graph with  @xmath24 vertices , denoted by  @xmath25 , is such that @xmath26 indicating that all the individuals can communicate with each other . from a modeling perspective , this is realistic for well - mixing colonies . in this case",
    ", we have the following result .    ",
    "[ th : complete ] let  @xmath27 and  @xmath28 .",
    "let  @xmath29 .    *",
    "regardless of the initial state , @xmath30 * the function  @xmath31 is decreasing on  @xmath32 and @xmath33    noticing that  @xmath34 is decreasing with respect to both the probability of defection and the colony size , the monotonicity of the function  @xmath35 implies the following .",
    "* the smaller the probability of defection  @xmath7 , the better the division of labor , i.e. , the fraction of individuals performing any given task gets closer to one half .",
    "this conclusion is expected from the definition of our model : cooperation improves the division of labor . *",
    "the smaller the colony size  @xmath24 , the better the division of labor . the intuition behind this result is that , at each update of an individual , the knowledge this individual gets about the tasks performed by the rest of the colony is only through a single random individual therefore the amount of information obtained from each interaction about the overall division of labor gets smaller as the size of the colony increases .",
    "the three different values of the limiting fraction of individuals performing task  1 in the second part of the theorem are also interesting from a biological point of view .    *",
    "the limit as  @xmath36 , i.e. , @xmath37 , is not obvious because   is not defined at  @xmath38 .",
    "however , the process is well defined when  @xmath39 . in this case",
    ", there is no cooperation so the process evolves as when the communication network is completely disconnected , which explains the value of the limit : @xmath40 . *",
    "the value at  @xmath41 is the most interesting one biologically because it gives the limiting behavior when the colony is large and the probability of defection is small . in this case",
    ", cooperation acts positively by making the fraction of individuals performing any given task closer to one half compared to the scenario where  @xmath39 . *",
    "the value at  @xmath42 corresponds to  @xmath15 and  @xmath43 and can be easily guessed : there is perfect cooperation and only two individuals so the two states where one individual performs task  1 and the other task  2 are absorbing states , which gives the value  1/2 .    * bipartite graphs .",
    "* theorem  [ th : complete ] shows that , at least for complete graphs , the division of labor is optimal , i.e. , converges to one half , when there are only two vertices and the defection probability converges to zero .",
    "we now extend this result to finite , connected , bipartite graphs . recall that a graph is bipartite",
    "when there exists a partition  @xmath44 of the vertex set into so - called bipartite sets such that vertices in the same bipartite set can not be neighbors , i.e. , @xmath45 in other words , individuals are separated into two groups and only communicate with members of the opposite group ( see figure  [ fig : graphs]d ) .",
    "at least when the defection probability is small , the dynamics of the process tends to separate the two tasks in each of the two bipartite sets .",
    "more precisely , the division of labor is bounded from above and from below as follows .     [ th : bipartite ] assume that  @xmath46 has  @xmath24 vertices , is connected and bipartite",
    ". then ,    * for all  @xmath47 , there exists  @xmath48 such that @xmath49 almost surely for all  @xmath50 , where  @xmath51 for  @xmath52 .",
    "note that a complete graph is a bipartite graph if and only if it has only two vertices . in this case",
    ", the previous theorem implies that , for all  @xmath50 , @xmath53 showing that the division of labor converges to one half as  @xmath54 .",
    "in particular , theorem  [ th : bipartite ] indeed extends the last limit in the statement of theorem  [ th : complete ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : frame]a and more generally any torus with degree two and an even number of vertices are other examples of bipartite graphs where both bipartite sets have the same cardinality .",
    "in particular , the theorem implies that   holds for all these graphs , which gives a proof of the simulation results of figure  [ fig : frame ] for the dashed curve in the neighborhood of  @xmath15 .",
    "another example of communication network more relevant for ecologists is to assume that the colony is spread out on the two - dimensional grid with vertex set @xmath55 \\times [ 0 , h ] \\ }",
    "\\quad \\hbox{where } \\quad l , h \\in { \\mathbb{n}}^*\\ ] ] and where there is an edge between vertices at euclidean distance one from each other . in this context , the individuals are mostly static and can only communicate with individuals which are close to them .",
    "this is an example of bipartite graph .",
    "the bipartite sets are given by @xmath56 these two sets differ in cardinality by at most one so @xmath57 for all  @xmath28 small according to theorem  [ th : bipartite ] , showing that , at least when  @xmath7 is small and the colony size is large , the division of labor again approaches one half . since these bipartite graphs have more edges than completely disconnected graphs but less edges than complete graphs , this shows a non - monotonic relationship between the degree distribution of the communication network and how well individuals organize themselves to accomplish both tasks equally .",
    "* one - dimensional lattice . *",
    "the last communication network we consider is the one - dimensional integer lattice : individuals are arranged in a line and can only communicate with their two nearest neighbors on the left and on the right .",
    "our main motivation is to show that more sophisticated techniques can be used to study the process on a simple infinite graph .",
    "in this case , the existence of the process follows from a general result due to harris  @xcite . because the graph is infinite , the random variables in   are no longer well - defined therefore we study instead the division of labor in an increasing sequence of spatial intervals @xmath58 as time  @xmath19 and space  @xmath24 both go to infinity",
    ". then , for the process on the infinite one - dimensional lattice , we have the following result that extends in part theorem  [ th : bipartite ] .",
    " [ th : lattice ] assume that  @xmath46 is the one - dimensional integer lattice and that the initial distribution of the process is a bernoulli product measure .",
    "then ,    * for all  @xmath47 , there exists  @xmath48 such that @xmath59    the theorem states that , when the defection probability is small , the fraction of individuals performing task  1 in a large spatial interval approaches one half .",
    "even though the one - dimensional lattice is a bipartite graph , the result does not simply follow from theorem  [ th : bipartite ] because the two bipartite sets are infinite .",
    "instead , the proof relies on a coupling between the dynamics of tasks and a system of annihilating random walks together with large deviation estimates .",
    "this section is devoted to the proof of theorem  [ th : complete ] which assumes that the communication network is a complete graph . to prove that the division of labor converges almost surely to a limit that does not depend on the initial state , we start with a general lemma about finite graphs that will be used in this section and the next one .",
    "now , in the special case of complete graphs , the process  @xmath17 that keeps track of the number of individuals performing task  1 turns out to be a continuous - time birth and death process . from this",
    ", we will deduce that the expected fraction of individuals performing task  1 satisfies a certain ordinary differential equation .",
    "the exact value of the almost sure limit of the division of labor is then obtained by showing that this limit is the unique fixed point in the biologically relevant interval  @xmath60 of the differential equation .    ",
    "[ lem : general ] let  @xmath46 be finite and  @xmath28",
    ". then  @xmath18 converges almost surely to a limit that does not depend on the initial configuration of the stochastic process .",
    "let  @xmath11 be a configuration and  @xmath4 be a vertex , and assume that  @xmath61 .",
    "since  @xmath28 , the rate at which vertex  @xmath4 switches task is bounded from below by @xmath62 this shows that the process is irreducible .",
    "since in addition the communication network is finite , the state space of the process is finite as well . in particular",
    ", standard markov chain theory implies that there is a unique stationary distribution  @xmath63 to which the process converges weakly starting from any initial configuration .",
    "moreover , we have the almost sure convergence @xmath64 where the integer  @xmath24 denotes the number of vertices .",
    "+   + in the next lemma , we compute the limit   for complete graphs . following the notation of the theorem , we let  @xmath65 denote this limit where  @xmath66 .    ",
    "[ lem : complete - limit ] for all  @xmath67 $ ] and  @xmath68 , we have @xmath69    the communication network being a complete graph , the transition rates   are invariant by permutation of the vertices therefore the spatial configuration of individuals is no longer relevant and the process  @xmath17 itself is markov .",
    "more precisely , since the state can only increase or decrease by one unit at a positive rate , this process is a continuous - time birth and death process , thus characterized by its birth and death parameters @xmath70 by standard properties of independent poisson processes , the birth parameter  @xmath71 is obtained by multiplying the number of individuals performing task  2 by the common rate at which each of these individuals switches to task  1 .",
    "together with  , this gives @xmath72 by symmetry , the death parameters are given by @xmath73 the next step is to use the transition rates   to derive a differential equation for the expected value of the fraction of individuals performing a given task at time  @xmath1 , namely @xmath74 even though these functions depend on the initial state , their limit as time goes to infinity does not according to lemma  [ lem : general ] . to compute the limit",
    ", we first observe that @xmath75 using also   , we deduce that @xmath76 recalling that  @xmath66 and  @xmath77 , we get @xmath78 since this is a polynomial with degree two in  @xmath79 and that @xmath80 we obtain the existence of a unique fixed point in  @xmath60 , namely  @xmath65 , which is globally asymptotically stable .",

    "we now deal with the second part , i.e. , we study the function  @xmath65 , which gives some insight into the role of the probability of defection and the size of the colony in the division of labor .",

    ", we put a type  @xmath5 particle on edge  @xmath150 if and only if the two individuals connected by this edge perform the same task  @xmath5 .",
    "returning to the special case of the one - dimensional lattice , this results in a process  @xmath151 defined as @xmath152 for all  @xmath153 . in particular , edges in state zero , that we call empty edges , connect individuals performing different tasks .",
    "the process  @xmath151 is not markov because the configuration in which all the edges are empty can result in two different configurations of tasks on the vertices .",
    "it can be proved , however , that the pair  @xmath154 is a markov process , but since this is not relevant to establish our theorem , we do not show this result . to understand the dynamics on the edges , we now look at the effect of the graphical representation on the configuration of particles .",

    "@xmath142 only affect the task at  @xmath4 , and so the state of the two edges incident to  @xmath4 , if and only if both vertices  @xmath4 and  @xmath111 perform the same task before the interaction .",
    "this leads to the two cases illustrated on the left - hand side of figure  [ fig : coupling ] as well as the additional two cases obtained by exchanging the roles of task  1 and task  2 . *",
    "dashed arrows have the same effect as solid arrows but only if both vertices  @xmath4 and  @xmath111 perform task  2 before the interaction .",
    "* similarly , dots at vertex  @xmath4 only affect the task at  @xmath4 , and so only the state of the two edges incident to vertex  @xmath4 .",
    "this leads to the four cases illustrated on the right - hand side of figure  [ fig : coupling ] as well as the additional four cases obtained by exchanging the roles of the tasks .",
    "* crosses have the same effect as dots only if  @xmath4 performs task  2 before the interaction .",
    "* type  @xmath5 particles jump at rate  @xmath155 to the right or to the left with probability one half and change their type at each jump .",
    "* there are spontaneous births of pairs of particles of type  @xmath5 at rate  @xmath156 at edges incident to a vertex not performing task  @xmath5 .",
    "* when two particles occupy the same edge as the result of a jump or a spontaneous birth , both particles annihilate .",
    "to prove that the limiting probability in   can be made arbitrarily small , we use the construction shown in figure  [ fig : particles ] .",
    "the proof also requires three simple estimates for the probability of the three events illustrated in the picture .",
    "these three estimates are given in the following three lemmas , where  @xmath158 is a small positive constant like in the statement of the theorem .",
    "first , we look at the special case when the defection probability is equal to zero .",
    "note that , when  @xmath15 , there is no spontaneous birth so the system of particles reduces to a system of annihilating symmetric random walks on the one - dimensional lattice that jump either at rate  @xmath161 or at rate  @xmath162 .",
    "since such a system goes extinct , there is  @xmath159 such that @xmath163 but since  @xmath164 is a time - homogeneous markov chain , @xmath165 this completes the proof .",
    "+   + the second step of the proof is to show that , with probability close to one , the set of space - time points that may have influenced the state of edge  @xmath166 at time  @xmath1 , which is traditionally called the influence set in the field of interacting particle systems , can not grow too fast .",
    "referring to the graphical representation , the influence set is the set of space - time points from which there is an oriented path of solid and dashed arrows leading to either  @xmath4 or  @xmath157 at time  @xmath1 .",
    "more formally , the influence set is defined as @xmath167 where  @xmath168 means that there exist @xmath169 such that , for  @xmath170 , there is an arrow  @xmath171 or  @xmath172 at time  @xmath173 . to state our next two lemmas ,",
    "we also introduce @xmath174 where  @xmath175 is the smallest integer not less than  @xmath176 .      for all  @xmath180 ,",
    "we write @xmath181 \\cap { \\mathbb{z } } ) \\times",

    "since arrows of either type from a given vertex to a given neighbor appear in the graphical representation at rate at most  @xmath185 , it follows from the definition of the influence set that @xmath186 in distribution for all  @xmath180 .",
