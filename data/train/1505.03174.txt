    "recently , this source has been detected by magic telescopes with a statistical significance of @xmath4 above 100 gev in 46 hr of stereo observations carried out between august 2010 and february 2011 .",
    "the measured differential energy spectrum between 70 gev and 500 gev can be described by a power law with a steep spectral index of @xmath5 , and the average flux above 100 gev is @xmath6 ( ) .",
    "we propose a lepto - hadronic model to describe the whole sed as the superposition of synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission and the neutral pion decay products .",
    "fermi - accelerated electrons in the emitting region are described by a broken power - law written as : @xmath7 for @xmath8 , and @xmath9 for @xmath10 and co - accelerated protons at the same place for a simple power law as : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the power index for electrons ( protons ) and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) are the electron ( proton ) lorentz factors .",
    "the index @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are for minimum , break and maximum , respectively . assuming that the emitting region is endowed by a magnetic field , electrons and protons are cooled down by electromagnetic ( synchrotron radiation and compton scattering ) and hadronic ( proton - photon interaction ) channels , respectively .",
    "taking into account the cooling processes for electron and proton distributions , the observed spectra for electron synchrotron radiation , compton scattering and proton - photon interaction are ( ( * ? ? ? * fraija ( 2014a ) ) , ( * ? ? ?",

    "it is important to highlight that the neutrino counterpart is calculated through @xmath31 , where the neutrino flux is dn@xmath32 , with @xmath33 .",
    "we have presented a lepton - hadronic model through eqs .",
    "[ espsyn ] , [ espsyn ] and [ pgamma ] to describe the broadband sed of ngc1275 . for the hadronic interactions we evoke the p@xmath0 interactions of fermi - accelerated protons with the target photons at the second ssc peak . to find the best fit of our leptonic and hadronic models , we use the method of chi - square ( @xmath34 ) minimization .",
    "the fit values for the leptonic model are shown in table 1 and 2 while for hadronic model are @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the leptonic model describes the photon spectrum up to a few gevs while the hadronic model up to hundreds of gevs .",
    "the neutrino event expected in a km@xmath2 cherenkov telescope is @xmath37 per year ."
