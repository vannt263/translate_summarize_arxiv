    "the relative distribution of galaxies and mass is of increasing concern in cosmology since constraints on cosmological parameters from galaxy surveys @xcite are only as accurate as our understanding of bias .",
    "unfortunately , bias is complicated . the commonly used assumption that the matter density fluctuations @xmath3 and the galaxy number density fluctuations @xmath4 obey g ( ) = b ( ) for some constant @xmath5 ( the bias factor ) appears to be violated in a number of ways .",
    "it has been known since the outset @xcite that @xmath5 must depend on galaxy type . however , there is also evidence that it depends on scale ( see @xcite and references therein ) and on time .",
    "time - evolution of bias is both expected theoretically @xcite and observed @xcite , with @xmath5 generally dropping towards unity from high values early on .",
    "this is due to two separate effects : ( 1 ) early galaxies are more biased at birth since they tend to be associated with rarer peaks .",
    "( 2 ) old galaxies gradually debias as they are gravitationally pulled into the same overdensities as the dark matter ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "moreover , on small scales where non - linear dynamics is important , one expects nonlinear corrections to .",
    "finally , there are good reasons to believe that there is _ no _ deterministic relation that can replace , but that bias is inherently somewhat stochastic @xcite .",
    "does this mean that galaxy redshift surveys will contribute nothing to the quest for accurate measurements of cosmological parameters ? not necessarily .",
    "below we will describe an approach that may be able to take us beyond the murky marshes of bias and let us do precision cosmology without assuming any bias relation in place of .",
    "dekel and lahav have proposed a framework termed _ stochastic biasing _",
    "@xcite , which drops the assumption that the galaxy fluctuations @xmath4 is uniquely determined by the matter fluctuations @xmath3 . instead",
    ", @xmath6 is modeled as a function of @xmath7 plus a random term . restricting attention to second moments",
    ", all the information about stochasticity is contained in a single new function @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "grouping the fluctuations into a two - dimensional vector ( ) and assuming nothing except translational invariance , its fourier transform @xmath9 obeys = ( 2)^3^d(- ) (       ) where @xmath10 is the bias factor ( the ratio of galaxy and total fluctuations ) and the new function @xmath11 is the dimensionless correlation coefficient between galaxies and matter .",
    "note that both @xmath5 and @xmath12 generally depend on scale @xmath13 .",
    "the schwarz inequality shows that the special case @xmath14 implies the simple deterministic , and the converse is of course true as well .",
    "since the function @xmath8 is a cosmologically important quantity , it has received much recent attention .",
    "pen has shown how it can be measured using redshift space distortions and nonlinear effects @xcite , and it has recently been computed for a number of theoretical models @xcite .",
    "its time - evolution has been derived in the linear regime @xcite and generalized to the perturbatively non - linear case @xcite . for a fixed galaxy population in an in an einstein - de sitter universe ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 , as in the standard cold dark matter model ) , the relation between the values @xmath17 at redshift @xmath18 and the present values @xmath19 reduces to @xcite b & = & [ z^2 - 2z(1+z)b_0 r_0 + ( 1+z)^2 b_0 ^ 2]^1/2,[beq3 ] + r & = & [ ( 1+z)b_0 r_0 - z]/b[req3 ] , plotted in figure 1 .",
    "both @xmath5 and @xmath12 have now been measured using hydrodynamic simulations @xcite , and other groups are performing related studies .",
    "why is this useful ?",
    "how can one learn anything about the matter density without making assumptions about how it relates to the galaxy density ? by assuming that the _ velocities _ are the same for galaxies as for other matter on large scales , , that they are both caused by gravity .",
    "this means that the characteristic clustering anisotropies known as redshift - space distortions @xcite will appear even if galaxies are completely uncorrelated . within the stochastic biasing framework , kaiser s classic result ( which assumes @xmath14 ) gets generalized to @xcite ( ) = p ( ) , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the line of sight direction ( for the special case of a volume - limited distant survey ) .",
    "the right - hand side is a quadratic polynomial in @xmath22 , so with a large data set such as the 2-degree field survey ( 2df ) or the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , one can accurately measure the three coefficients . for each scale @xmath13 , thus gives us three independent equations .",
    "if the matter density @xmath23 can be accurately measured by other means ( using say upcoming cmb experiments , supernova 1a surveys and cluster abundance evolution ) , then these three equations are readily solved for the three unknowns @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath8 .",
    "the last two would then provide valuable insights about galalaxy formation , whereas @xmath24 would give us the long sought for power spectrum of the underlying matter distribution which could , among other things , provide precision constraints on neutrino masses @xcite and the hubble constant @xcite .    the author wishes to thank john bahcall , michael blanton , ben bromley , avishai dekel , daniel eisenstein , wayne hu , ofer lahav , jerry ostriker , jim peebles , ue - li pen , martin rees and michael strauss for useful discussions ."
