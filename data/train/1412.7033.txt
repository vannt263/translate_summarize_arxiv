    "the kerr geometry in four - dimensional general relativity possesses remarkable properties , such as black hole thermodynamics and the uniqueness of stationary , axisymmetric , asymptotically flat vacuum solution of the einstein equation with a regular event horizon ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most important features is the integrability of its geodesic equation .",
    "this was proven by showing the separability of the hamilton - jacobi equation for the geodesic system in the boyer - lindquist coordinates and the existence of an additional constant of motion , called the carter constant  @xcite .",
    "this non - trivial constant is given by a second - rank killing tensor in the kerr geometry  @xcite , which is a generalization of killing vectors to symmetric tensors .",
    "consequently , the separation of variables has great advantages in studying freely falling particle motion around a kerr black hole .    for the last few decades",
    ", many efforts are devoted to studying the higher - dimensional black hole solutions of the einstein equation and their physical properties highly motivated by superstring theories and the scenarios with large extra dimensions  ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) . in those works , it turned out that the stationary rotating black holes in higher dimensions do not inherit all of the properties in the four - dimensional kerr geometry .",
    "for example ,",
    "the myers - perry geometries  @xcite , which describe black holes with spherical horizon topology , have no uniqueness in stationary rotating black hole solutions in higher dimensions .",
    "however , the integrability of the geodesic equation remains valid in the myers - perry geometry . in five dimensions ,",
    "the separation of variables occurs in the hamilton - jacobi equation for geodesic system  @xcite .",
    "after these findings , the geodesic equation in the most general known vacuum black hole solution with a horizon of spherical topology is found to be integrable in all dimensions ( see , for a review ,  @xcite ) .    in five - dimensional spacetimes ,",
    "there also exist the black hole solutions that have unusual horizon topology , called the black ring solutions  @xcite .",
    "the simplest one is the emparan - reall black ring geometry  @xcite , which possesses @xmath0 horizon topology and rotates on its symmetric axis . unlike the case of the myers - perry geometry ,",
    "the hamilton - jacobi equation for the geodesic system in the black ring geometry is not separable at least in the ring coordinates except for special cases of geodesics  @xcite .",
    "although non - separability of the hamilton - jacobi equation is a necessary condition for the non - integrability of the geodesic equation , there exists a strong indication for the non - integrability of the geodesic equation .",
    "indeed , the existence of chaotic behavior of geodesics in the black ring geometry was demonstrated by the poincar map method  @xcite .",
    "recently , the absence of the killing - yano and conformal killing - yano tensors in the black ring geometry has been rigorously proved in @xcite .",
    "this result indicates that the black ring geometry is less symmetric compared to the myers - perry geometry .",
    "however , since the existence of constants of geodesic motion is related to the killing tensor , the mathematical proof of non - integrability of the geodesic system in black ring spacetimes still remains an open problem .",
    "chaos is universal phenomena in various nonlinear systems , and the appearance of geodesic chaos also is one of the important issues in general relativity . in the majumdar - papapetrou geometry  @xcite that represents two - fixed extremal black holes there exist geodesic chaos  @xcite .",
    "the results in @xcite suggest that its geodesic system is chaotic in the higher - dimensional majumdar - papapetrou geometry as well . in the newtonian limit of four - dimensional two - fixed black holes , the geodesic system reduces to newtonian particle system around two - fixed centers , which is known as euler s three - body problem  @xcite . this reduced system is integrable , because there exists an additional constant that is quadratic in momentum .",
    "therefore , the geodesic chaos in the majumdar - papapetrou geometry is caused by relativistic effects .",
    "thus , a natural question arises in the study of geodesic chaos in the black ring geometry : whether or not the chaos is caused by relativistic effects .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the geodesic chaos does not appear in the weak - field approximation , and thus it is generated by strong gravitational effects . in order to show this",
    ", we show the integrability of the geodesic equation in the black ring geometry in the newtonian limit .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section ,",
    "the newtonian limit of the geodesic equation in the singly rotating black ring geometry is demonstrated . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , the newtonian potential obtained in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] is shown to agree with the one generated by a homogeneous ring gravitational source . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] , the newtonian equation of particle motion around the ring source is demonstrated to allow the separation of variables in the spheroidal coordinates , and provide an additional constant of motion that is quadratic in momentum .",
    "finally , the implication of our results is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] .",
    "in this section , we derive a newtonian potential from the newtonian limit of the geodesic equation in the thin black ring geometry .",
    "the newtonian limit of the geodesic equation requires slow motion and weak gravitational field limit .",
    "let @xmath1 be the world line of a freely falling particle with a proper time @xmath2 .",
    "for the motion much slower than the speed of light , i.e. , in the slow motion limit , the four velocity @xmath3 is approximately one for the time component and zero for the spatial components . in the weak field limit",
    ", a metric @xmath4 is decomposed as @xmath5 in global inertial coordinates , where @xmath6 denotes the flat metric and @xmath7 .",
    "hence the geodesic equation in the newtonian limit becomes @xmath8 where the second term of the christoffel symbol in the linear approximation of @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 finally , reduces to the newtonian equation of motion of a particle subjected to the gravitational force due to the newtonian potential that is defined as @xmath11 note that the time derivative of @xmath12 is neglected , because we consider a stationary spacetime .",
    "let us determine the explicit form of @xmath13 in the case of the black ring geometry .",
    "the five - dimensional singly rotating black ring metric in the ring coordinates is of the form @xmath14 with @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are constants and characterize the ring radius , rotational velocity , and thickness of the black ring horizon , respectively . from the regularity of the solutions , @xmath17 must be @xmath19 and then the regular black ring solutions have two - free parameters @xmath16 and @xmath18 . note that absence of naked singularities requires the thickness parameters to be @xmath20 .",
    "we introduce the polar coordinates given by @xmath21 and @xmath22 where the flat limit of the metric in these coordinates is of the form @xmath23 the time - time component of the metric   in the new coordinates is given by @xmath24 from and , the time - time component of @xmath9 is given by @xmath25 the leading order of the expansion in @xmath18 takes the form @xmath26 note that the other components of @xmath9 defined in must be much smaller than unity in the case @xmath27 , because the metric goes to flat in the limit @xmath28 .",

    "hence , the newtonian limit of the geodesic equation in the singly rotating thin black ring geometry reduces to the newtonian equation of motion of a particle subjected to gravitational force due to the newtonian potential  .",
    "since the topology of the curvature singularity in the black ring geometry is ring shape and the horizon in this case is very thin , it is expected that the matter distribution producing is a ring source .",
    "in this section we provide the explicit form of the newtonian potential due to a homogeneous ring source placed on four - dimensional flat space by integrating the basic equation of higher - dimensional newton gravity .",
    "as will be seen in the last of this section , the newtonian potential takes the same form of the potential obtained in the previous section .    by analogy with the configuration of the curvature singularity of the black ring geometry ,",
    "let us place a homogeneous ring source on a circle of radius @xmath16 from the coordinate origin in the two - dimensional plane with @xmath37 .",
    "then the mass density is of the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the total mass of the ring source in this section and @xmath40 is the delta function .",
    "the basic equation to determine the form of gravitational potential is the newtonian gravitational field equation in higher dimensions @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes laplacian of the flat space , @xmath43 is the gravitational constant in five dimensions .",
    "note that this equation is consistent with the newtonian limit of the einstein equation given in and up to the numerical factor .",
    "the solution to is written in the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the volume element on @xmath46 .",
    "the integration of with the matter distribution   provides the explicit form of the newtonian potential due to the ring source as @xmath47 thus agrees with under the identification of the total mass @xmath39 of the homogeneous ring source as the arnowitt - deser - misner mass of the black ring  .",
    "thus , it is shown that the gravitational field of the black ring in the newtonian limit reduces to the newtonian potential produced by a homogeneous ring source .",

    "hence , it is concluded that chaotic orbits of a particle in a five - dimensional black ring is caused by relativistic effect .    for physical understanding ,",
    "let us rewrite @xmath81 in the polar coordinates as @xmath82 where @xmath83 note that @xmath84 is the squared total angular momentum .",

    "the geodesic equation in the thin black ring geometry reduces to the newtonian equation of motion of a particle moving in the gravitational potential generated by a homogeneous ring source .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the curvature singularity of the black ring has s@xmath89 topology and the event horizon is thin in this case .",
    "the main result is that the newtonian equation of particle motion allows the separation of variables in the spheroidal coordinates , and then , there exists an additional constant of motion quadratic in momentum analogous to the carter constant in the kerr geometry .",

    "hence , it is concluded that the appearance of geodesic chaos in the black ring geometry is caused by relativistic effects .",
    "our result implies the existence of an approximate constant for the geodesic system and an approximate killing tensor in the thin black ring geometry .",
