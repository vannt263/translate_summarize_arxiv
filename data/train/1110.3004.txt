    "the study of entanglement , which is one of the most fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics , has lead to and is still leading to much important progress and applications in different fields of modern physics such as quantum information@xcite , condensed matter physics@xcite , etc .. to name a few , it has lead to better undertanding of density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite ; it has also been proposed to be a tool for the characterization of certain topological phases@xcite .    among various ways of quantifying entanglement , in condensed matter or many - body physics efforts",
    "have mainly focused on the bipartite block entanglement entropy ( von neumann entropy ) and its generalizations ( rnyi or tsallis entropy ) .",
    "it has become increasingly useful in characterizing phases@xcite and phase transitions@xcite .",
    "the area law@xcite is one of the most important results on entanglement entropy : it states that the entanglement entropy is proportional to the area of the surface separating two subsystems .",
    "however , thus far there are two important classes of systems that violate the area law : in gapless one dimensional ( 1d ) systems , a logarithmic divergence@xcite is found where according to the area law the entanglement entropy should saturate as the size of the subsystem grows ; in higher dimensions , for free fermions the area law is found to be corrected by a similar logarithmic factor @xmath1@xcite , where @xmath2 is the linear dimension of the subsystem .    in this work ,",
    "we first show that the scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy for systems with a fermi surface is the same as that of 1d systems with fermi points@xcite .",
    "we then seek for a generalization of the latter to interacting fermions in the fermi liquid phase .",
    "we first develop an intuitive understanding via a toy model , showing that in this model the entanglement entropy has the same form as that given in by gioev and klich ( gk ) in ref .",
    "we then develop a more general and formal treatment using the method of high - dimensional bosonization@xcite .",
    "this approach will not only lead to a reproduction of the result for free fermions obtained by gk based on widom s conjecture@xcite , but will also lend itself to the inclusion and subsequent treatment of fermi liquid type ( forward scattering ) interactions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : toy_model ] , we describe the toy model for which the entanglement entropy can be written in the same form as the gk result . then in sec .",
    "[ sec : bosonization ] , we briefly introduce the tool box of multi - dimensional bosonization , and apply it to free fermions to reproduce the gk formula .",
    "the main results of this work are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : ee ] in which we calculate the entanglement entropy of a fermi liquid for a special geometry using a combination of multi - dimensional bosonization and the replica trick .",
    "we subsequently summarize and discuss our results .",
    "some technical details are discussed in two appendices .",
    "consider a set of decoupled parallel 1d chains of non - interacting spinless fermions with spacing @xmath3 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : realspace ] . here",
    "we only consider @xmath4 for simplicity , but this toy model is viable in general @xmath5 dimensions .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of entanglement entropy in large @xmath2 limit of a convex subsystem @xmath6 of this model can be obtained by simply counting the number of chains that intersect @xmath6 , and each segment contributes a @xmath7 where @xmath2 is the linear dimension of the subsystem@xcite . due to the logarithm , different shapes only lead to differences at the area law level . since each segment must have two intersections , we can count the intersections instead , which also automatically takes care of non - convex geometries .",
    "although there is an additional correction for multiple intervals on a single chain@xcite , as long as only the @xmath1 behavior is concerned , that contribution is negligible . for @xmath2 large enough ,",
    "we can write the number of these intersections as an integral over the surface of @xmath6 projected onto the direction perpendicular to the chains times one half of the chain density , @xmath8 . to make contact with the gk result , we note this model also has fermi surfaces as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fermisurface ] with a total `` area '' of @xmath9 .",
    "this enables us to replace the density of chains by an integral over the fermi surfaces of the system @xmath10 where @xmath11 indicates the occupied area in momentum space so its boundary @xmath12 is the fermi surface(s ) .",
    "therefore we can write the entanglement entropy as [ eq : toy_model ]    s(_a ) & = l _ a ds_x + & = l _ a _ _ x ds_k ,    where @xmath13 is the direction along the chains which is also normal to the fermi surface , and an overall factor of @xmath14 accounts for the double counting of chain segments . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : toy_model ] ) we recover the gk formula in this special case but written in a slightly different way . in ref .",
    "[ ] the entanglement entropy is given as : s = _ a _ _ _ ds _ ds _ , where the real space surface integral is carried out over the subsystem whose volume is normalized to @xmath15 .",
    "the surface area is factored out as @xmath16 . however , in our formula the surface area @xmath17 is implicitly included in the integral over the surface of the subsystem .",
    "we note that the model discussed in ref.@xcite is equivalent with our toy model , but motivated from a different perspective . in ref.@xcite , models are constructed from the momentum space , either with fermi surfaces as our toy model , or a square fermi surface , and a boxlike and a spherical geometry are discussed .",
    "in contrast , our toy model is constructed from a real space perspective , and general single connected geometries are discussed .    motivated by the toy model ,",
    "in this work we extend this intuitive understanding of gk s result to generic free fermi systems and generalize it to include fermi liquid interactions in two dimensions ( 2d ) via high dimensional bosonization . using the method of multi - dimensional bosonization",
    ", the fermi liquid theory can be written as a tensor product of low - energy effective theories of quasi-1d systems similar to this toy model , along all directions .",
    "this provides us with a tool to treat the entanglement entropy of fermions in high dimensions , even in the presence of _",
    "interactions_.    at this point , we could also include forward scattering for each chain , and from 1d bosonization we know that for spinless fermions this only leads to renormalization of the fermi velocity , thus does not change the logarithmic scaling of the entanglement entropy for this toy model .",
    "this hints that the same conclusion might hold for fermi liquids , as we can include fermi liquid interactions in a similar way via high dimensional bosonization .",
    "although as we show later , this is indeed true at the leading order , the situation is more delicate than it seems to be .",
    "the fermi liquid interactions couple a family of `` toy models '' aligned along different directions in the language of high dimensional bosonization , and lead to a correction to the entanglement entropy @xmath18 .",
    "the scheme of multi - dimensional bosonization was first introduced by haldane@xcite , followed by others@xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to start with a low energy effective hamiltonian ( obtained through a renormalization group ( rg ) approach ) restricted to within a thin shell of thickness @xmath19 around the fermi surface , @xmath20 .",
    "then one divides this thin shell into @xmath21 patches with dimensionality @xmath22 as shown in fig.(2 ) in such a way that @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the space dimension , @xmath26 is the linear dimension of the tangential extent of each patch . the condition @xmath27 minimizes inter - patch scattering ; @xmath28 and @xmath24 together makes the curvature of the fermi surface negligible . in the end",
    "we shall take the limit @xmath29 , so that the sum over all patches can be converted to an integral over the fermi surface . in this work",
    ", we treat the free theory in general @xmath5 dimensions , but shall restrict ourselves to @xmath4 when interactions are included .    [",

    "physically one can view this as _ discretization _ along the transverse direction due to a restricted momentum range , similar to the relation between a lattice and its brillouin zone .",
    "in this view the single patch problem is reduced to a 1d problem with a chain density of @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : bh_free ] ) becomes h_0 = _  ; _  dx_ ( _ x_ (  ; ) ) ^2 .",
    "note that the bosonized theory of a single patch is chiral . to directly make use of our toy model",

    "this is because for a 1d fermion model at non - zero filling , there are two fermi points .",
    "both need to be considered to construct well - defined local degrees of freedom .",
    "once we consider such two patches together , it is more convenient to combine the two chiral theories into a non - chiral theories .",

    ".    therefore , two patches with opposite @xmath42 are equivalent to a set of ordinary 1d boson fields . throughout the rest of this work",
    ", we shall assume this chiral - to - nonchiral transformation is done , and when we refer to patches we always refer to the two companion patches that form a non - chiral patch together .",
    "for the non - chiral boson theory , it is known that the entanglement entropy of a single interval ( with two end points ) is @xmath7 .",
    "before we proceed further , we note that the relation between boson fields and the original fermion fields is not completely local .",
    "however , the underlying physical quantity that matters is not the fields , but the fermion density , or in other words , the fermion number basis one chooses to expand the hilbert space of the problem .",
    "this physical basis is also what one uses to do the partial trace .",
    "it is known that the fermion density operator obeys a locally one - to - one corresponding relation to the boson fields .",
    "thus we argue that in 1d the nonlocal relation between the fermion and boson fields does not affect the partial trace operation , so as the calculation of entanglement entropy .    by referring to our result for the toy model , the contribution from a single patch",

    ", the total entanglement entropy is    [ eq : gk ] s & = l _ a _ _ k d_x .",

    ", the hamiltonian is readily diagonalized . ref .",
    "[ ] solves the hubbard-@xmath98 like interaction and provides a successful description of fermi liquids , even in the strong @xmath98 limit .",

    "consequently , the real space fields constructed from the bogoliubov operators @xmath101 and @xmath102 are _ no longer _ local with respect to the original boson fields .",

    "the loss of locality prevents us from calculating the entanglement entropy directly using those eigen modes , since it is difficult to implement the partial trace using those non - local degrees of freedoms .",

    "[ ] , though correctly suggesting the @xmath1 violation to the area law for fermi liquids , does not always fully account for all sources of entanglement entropy .",

    "this is indeed the case as we have already seen in previous calculation .",
    "however , at the lowest order , everything is independent on @xmath326",
    ". actually what finally appears in the the entanglement entropy are the @xmath327derivatives of these terms appearing in the e - l summation formula .",
    "this means the leading term has vanishing contribution to the entanglement entropy .",
    "the first term contributing to entanglement entropy is then @xmath328 the upper limit of which is order @xmath293 and only leads a correction up to @xmath294 to the free fermion entanglement entropy .",

    "the criticality associated with the fermi surface ( or points ) .",

    "find no correction to the leading scaling behavior .",
    "we also point out that the situation is the same at higher orders .",
    "our results thus strongly suggest that the leading scaling behavior of the block entanglement entropy of a fermi liquid is the _ same _ as that of a free fermi gas with the same fermi surface , not only for the special block geometry studied in this paper , but for arbitrary geometries .",
    "explicit demonstration of the latter is an obvious direction for future work .    in the special geometry in which we performed explicit calculations using the replica trick ,",
    "a mass - like term is introduced to regularize the theory at long distance , as is done in closely related contexts@xcite . for a fermi liquid ( which is quantum - critical ) the corresponding length scale @xmath329",
    "must be identified with the block size @xmath2 , and is thus _ not _ an independent length scale . on the other hand , such a mass - like term",
    "can also describe a superconducting gap due to pairing . in particular , for a weak - coupling superconductor , @xmath330 , the superconducting coherence length ,",
    "is much longer than all microscopic length scales , but finite nevertheless . in this case",
    "it is _ independent _ of @xmath2 , and the interplay between the two is interesting . for @xmath331 ,",
    "the fermi liquid result ( [ eq : toy_model ] ) still holds .",
    "but for @xmath332 , the logarithmic factor in the entanglement entropy _ saturates _ at @xmath333 , and we expect : @xmath334 which agrees with the conjecture made in ref.@xcite .",
    "more generally , fermi liquids are ( perhaps the best understood ) examples of quantum critical phases ( or points ) in high dimensions . unlike in 1d where conformal symmetry powerfully constrains the behavior of entanglement entropy , our understanding of entanglement properties of such high - dimensional quantum critical phases or points ( many of them have fermi surfaces but are _ not _ fermi liquids )",
    "is very limited .",
    "our work can be viewed as a step in that general direction .",
