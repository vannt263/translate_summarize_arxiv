    "studying solar - like oscillations provides a powerful method to probe the interiors of stars @xcite .",
    "solar - like oscillations are expected in low - mass main - sequence stars cooler than the red edge of the classical instability strip in the hr diagram @xcite , as well as in more evolved red giants which represent the future of our own sun @xcite .",
    "it is thought that turbulent convective motions near the surface excite the oscillations stochastically .",
    "asteroseismology of red giants has developed rapidly .",
    "it began with several detections of solar - like oscillations in g and k - type giants based on ground - based observations in both radial velocity @xcite and photometry @xcite and on space - based photometry detections observed by the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ; @xcite ) , _ wide field infrared explorer _ ( _ wire _ ; @xcite ) , _ solar mass ejection imager _ ( _ smei _ ; @xcite ) , and _ microvariability and oscillations of stars _ ( _ most _ ; @xcite ) .",
    "the oscillation periods in red giants range from hours to days .",
    "ground - based observations usually suffer from interruptions and aliasing which complicate the measurement of oscillations . on the other hand , observations from space",
    "can provide high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and continuous data sets from which we may extract the oscillation parameters accurately .",
    "the 150-day observations by the _ convection rotation and planetary transits satellite _ ( _ corot _ ) clearly detected radial and non - radial oscillations in the range 10100  @xcite , which greatly increased the number of detected pulsating g and k giants and led to a huge breakthrough in the study of red giants .",
    "these observations were followed by even more impressive results by _ kepler _  ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this paper presents observations and models of hd 186355 ( hip 96878 , kic 11618103 ) , which is one of the brightest red giants in the _ kepler _  field ( v = 7.95 ) .",
    "the _ kepler _  mission @xcite was successfully launched on march 7 , 2009 .",
    "its primary scientific goal of is to search for earth - sized planets in or near the habitable zone and to determine how many stars have this kind of planets in our milky way .",
    "_ kepler _  is equipped with a 0.95-meter diameter telescope with an array of ccds which continuously points to a large area of the sky in the constellations cygnus and lyra to detect the transits of the planets . over the whole course of the mission ( at least 3.5 years ) , the spacecraft will measure the variations in the brightness of more than 100,000 stars , which will be outstanding data for the study of asteroseismology . for many of these stars",
    "we can detect solar - like oscillations , which will allow us to investigate them in detail and obtain their fundamental properties , by using the techniques of asteroseismology @xcite .",
    "we used the first five quarters of data of hd 186355 , which covers a total of about 13 months .",
    "the raw long - cadence data ( 29.4 minutes sampling ; jenkins et al .",
    "2010 ) were corrected by performing a point - to - point sigma clipping to remove the outliers .",
    "additionally , a thermal drift was corrected by fitting a second - order polynomial to the affected parts of the time - series . from the parallax of 5.44 @xmath2 0.63 mas @xcite and using a bolometric correction for g5 giants of -0.34 from @xcite , we derived the luminosity of the star to be 24.0 @xmath2 5.6 @xmath5 .",
    "we take the effective temperature ( @xmath6 = 4867 @xmath2 150 k ) from _ kepler _  input catalogue ( kic ; brown et al .",
    "solar - like oscillations are usually high - order and low - degree p - modes .",
    "their frequencies are regularly spaced , approximately following the asymptotic relation @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the radial order and @xmath9 is the angular degree .",
    "the quantity @xmath1 ( large frequency separation ) is approximately the inverse of the sound travel time across the star , while @xmath10 is sensitive to the surface layers and , for relatively unevolved stars , @xmath11 is sensitive to the sound speed gradient near the core .",
    "as the star evolves , the stellar envelope starts to expand and the p - mode frequencies gradually decrease while oscillations in the core driven by buoyancy ( g - modes ) shift to higher frequencies .",
    "this eventually leads to so - called `` mixed modes '' .",
    "these are non - radial oscillation modes that have a mixed character , behaving like g - modes in the core and p - modes in the envelope , and shifting in frequency as they undergo the so - called _ avoided crossings _ @xcite . for red giants , the asymptotic @xmath9 = 1 modes in particular depart from the relation due to many avoided crossings @xcite .",
    "our frequency analysis covers three basic steps that are performed on the power spectrum of the _ kepler _  light curve : fitting and correcting for the background ; estimating the frequency of maximum power ( @xmath0 ) and the large separation ( @xmath1 ) ; and extracting individual frequencies ( @xmath12 ) . in the following subsections ,",
    "we describe the three analysis steps in detail .",
    "the power spectrum shows a frequency - dependent background signal due to stellar activity , granulation and faculae which can be modelled by a sum of several lorentzian - like functions @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "stellar activity , granulation and faculae were represented by modified lorentzian - like functions , first introduced by @xcite , which give a better fit to the background than a harvey model with a constant slope of @xmath13 .",
    "this background model has a shallower slope at low frequencies and a steeper slope at higher frequencies , corresponding to stellar activity and granulation , respectively .",
    "the power excess hump from stellar oscillations is approximately gaussian , so the complete spectrum was modeled by : @xmath14 where @xmath15 corresponds to the white noise component , @xmath16 is the rms intensity of the granules and @xmath17 is the characteristic time scale of granulation . for the gaussian term ,",
    "the parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are the height , the central frequency , and the width of the power excess hump .",
    "[ fg : background ] shows the power density spectrum of hd 186355 , together with the fitted model using eq .",
    "( [ eq : background ] ) .",
    "the three components of the background and the white noise were simultaneously fitted to a lightly smoothed power spectrum ( gaussian with fwhm of 0.5 @xmath21 ) outside the region where the power excess hump is seen .",
    "the value of @xmath0 was obtained by fitting to a heavily smoothed power spectrum ( gaussian with fwhm of 3 @xmath1 , where @xmath1 is estimated in sect .  [",
    "sc : freq ] ) , giving 106.5 @xmath2 0.3 @xmath21 .",
    "finally , the background and the white noise were subtracted from the power density spectrum , leaving only the oscillation signal ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fg : background ] ) .      the background - corrected power spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fg : background ] shows the clear signature of solar - like oscillations : a regular series of peaks spaced by the large separation .",
    "we also see multiple peaks due to mixed @xmath22 modes ( see also sect .  [",
    "sc : mod ] , beck et al .",
    "2011 , bedding et al .",
    "the power spectrum is shown in chelle format in fig .",
    "[ fg : echps ] , both with and without smoothing .",
    "this diagram was made by dividing the power spectrum into six segments , each @xmath1 wide .",
    "we see that the peaks align vertically , allowing us to assign the @xmath9 values indicated on figs .",
    "[ fg : background ] and  [ fg : echps ] .",
    "we do not see an obvious signature of rotational splitting , and the effect of stellar rotation is not considered in this paper .    to extract the frequencies of individual oscillation modes , we used the software package period04 @xcite .",
    "this uses iterative sinewave fitting , which does a good job of extracting frequencies in cases such as this , where the individual modes are unresolved or barely resolved .",
    "the red lines in fig .",
    "[ fg : echps ] show the frequencies of 33 extracted peaks with snr greater than 3 ) .",
    "these are listed in table  [ tb : fre ] , together with their amplitudes and uncertainties .",
    "the uncertainties derived by period04 are underestimates because they only consider the internal consistency of the parameters .",
    "we derived more realistic uncertainties ( the second column in table  [ tb : fre ] ) by means of monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the residual time - series @xmath23 were obtained by subtracting the sum of multiple sine functions of frequencies @xmath24 and the corresponding amplitudes @xmath25 and phases @xmath26 from the observed time - series @xmath27 as @xmath28 then @xmath29 is regarded as the observational uncertainty in  @xmath30 .",
    "we constructed 100 simulated time - series @xmath31 , which have the same residuals as the observed time - series .",
    "the 100 simulated time - series were fitted with the sum of multiple sine functions by taking @xmath32 as initial values according to least - squares algorithm .",
    "hence 100 sets of new @xmath32 were obtained .",
    "the standard deviations of each parameter of @xmath32 were then calculated , which were adopted as the uncertainty estimates of the parameters .",
    "we also calculated the mean large frequency separation @xmath1 by performing a linear fit to the five @xmath33 modes .",
    "each data point was weighted by the uncertainty of the frequency listed in table  [ tb : fre ] .",
    "frequencies for @xmath33 modes are the most suitable ones for this calculation because they are not affected by the mixing with g modes .",
    "the slope of the fitted line gave the large separation to be @xmath34hz .",
    "the common way to estimate the fundamental properties is to compare calculated model parameters with the observational constraints .",
    "we employed the yale rotating stellar evolution code ( yrec ; demarque et al .",
    "2008 ) for stellar evolution modelling computations , and the non - radial and non - adiabatic stellar pulsation programme jig developed by @xcite for frequency calculations .",
    "yrec can evolve our models up to the tip of the red giant branch , which is adequate for hd 186355 .",
    "the input physics of the current yrec version ( yrec7 ) included the latest opal opacity tables @xcite , opal equation of state @xcite and nacre reaction rates @xcite . at low temperatures ,",
    "opacities are obtained from @xcite .",
    "convection is treated under the assumption of _ mixing length theory _ @xcite .",
    "we did not take rotation , diffusion or convective overshoot into consideration in our calculation .",
    "there are several main inputs in yrec7mass , @xmath35 ( to determine the mixing - length @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is pressure scale height ) , hydrogen abundance ( @xmath38 ) and heavy - element abundance ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the best models are searched among those grids after being compared with observational constraints . for our models , @xmath35 and @xmath38",
    "were fixed to the solar values of 1.8 and 0.72 , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath39 was varied within a certain range , usually from 0.005 to 0.025 with a step of 0.002 , but it changes for models with different masses .",
    "our initial estimate for the mass was made using scaling relations .",
    "@xcite proposed a scaling relation that can be used to predict  by scaling from the solar case : @xmath40 this relation gives a very good estimate for  for less evolved stars @xcite , while @xcite have shown that it holds also for stars on the giant branch , although with larger uncertainties .",
    "@xcite give the scaling relation to predict @xmath41 knowing ,  and @xmath6 , the stellar mass is estimated by : @xmath42 using  and  from sec .",
    "[ sc : osc ] and @xmath43 from kic , the stellar mass is estimated as 1.41 @xmath2 0.14 @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , the initial masses of our models were chosen to be within the range of 1.25 to 1.55 @xmath44 with a step of 0.01 @xmath44 .    we looked for models for which the parameters are located inside the 1-@xmath45 error box confined by the uncertainties of observational results in the h - r diagram . for these sets of modelling parameters",
    ", we used a fine resolution for @xmath39 ( in steps of 0.001 ) in order to find the best models .",
    "some models with larger masses were also calculated , with a bigger mass step of 0.1 @xmath44 , in an attempt to search for models in a large range , because the scaling relations and hence the estimated mass are not so reliable for the giant branch stars .",
    "[ fg : track ] shows several evolutionary tracks of models having different input parameters .",
    "the rectangle is the 1-@xmath45 error box whose center corresponds to the observed stellar properties , from which we can see that hd 186355 is on the ascending giant branch , in the shell hydrogen - burning phase .",
    "those models for which the parameters are within the error box and the mean large frequency separations are around 9.37  ( within 0.03 ) are indicated by dots .",
    "different evolutionary tracks may pass through the same position in the h - r diagram by tuning the inputs .",
    "for example , a decrease of mass can be compensated by a decrease of hydrogen and heavy elements abundances to obtain the same position .",
    "taking variations of the mixing - length into consideration , which move the tracks horizontally but have almost no influence on the luminosity , makes it even more complex to look for models .",
    "however , it is beyond the scope of this paper to consider the effects of varying the mixing - length and hydrogen abundance .",
    "we performed a @xmath46 minimization to find the best models .",
    "the definition of the @xmath46 function was based on two observed stellar parameters ( luminosity and @xmath43 ) and on the individual frequencies , as follows : @xmath47 where terms with primes are observed values , @xmath48 is the number of observed frequencies and @xmath49 is the uncertainty of each frequency",
    ". we did not find it necessary to apply an offset to the model frequencies to correct for near - surface effects @xcite .",
    "we began by fitting only one mode of each degree in each order .",
    "for @xmath9 = 1 we took the strongest peak in each order .",
    "the results based on these 17 observed frequencies are listed in table  [ tb : chi ] .",
    "although tracks for models with masses larger than 1.60 @xmath44 also pass through the error box , their oscillation parameters differ greatly from the observations , which leads to bigger @xmath46 . from table",
    "[ tb : chi ] we can see the best model has a mass of 1.43 @xmath44 and @xmath39 of 0.012 .",
    "however , the difference between this and the 1.60 @xmath44 model is very small , which makes the latter one a candidate for the upper limit of the stellar mass estimation . in order to investigate this",
    ", we plot a series of chelle diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fg : ech ] to compare the theoretical and observed frequencies for each model shown in table  [ tb : chi ] . only those frequencies having minima of mode inertia ( see fig .  [ fg : int ] ) are shown , because those modes will have the highest amplitudes at the stellar surface .",
    "good agreement is found for 1.43 @xmath44 , and models with larger masses do not reproduce the observed frequencies as well .",
    "however , the 1.60 @xmath44 model is an exception which produces a rather good match to observed frequencies for @xmath33 and 2 modes .",
    "the location of the 1.60 @xmath44 model is close to the center of error box in hr diagram which , combined with the relatively good fit to the @xmath9 = 0 and 2 , leads to a smaller @xmath46 result than models with higher masses . after being compared with the theoretical modes in chelle diagrams , the degrees of observed modes ( see fig .",
    "[ fg : echps ] ) are confirmed , including two modes with @xmath50 .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sc : freq ] , we found multiple oscillation peaks per order for @xmath4 ( see table  [ tb : fre ] ) that we interpret as mixed modes .",
    "as discussed by @xcite and @xcite , it is impossible to observe some mixed modes ( g - dominated mixed modes ) because they have very high inertias .",
    "however , other mixed modes act more like p modes ( p - dominated mixed modes ) , having a lower inertia than the g - dominated mixed modes and hence larger amplitude , which makes them observable . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have shown that pure g modes are equally spaced in period .",
    "p - dominated mixed modes are only approximately equally spaced in period . measuring",
    "the period spacings for these observed mixed modes allows us to probe the cores of red giant stars . @xcite",
    "have detected mixed modes in a red giant star with _ kepler _",
    "data and measured their period spacing .",
    "subsequently , @xcite have found a way to distinguish between hydrogen - burning and helium - burning red giants by using their different period spacings .",
    "they found that hydrogen - shell burning stars have observed period spacings mostly around 50 s , while stars with helium - burning cores have observed period spacings of about 100 to 300 s. the observed mean period spacing of hd 186355 is 58 @xmath2 4 s which",
    "we measured by means of power spectrum of the power spectrum method @xcite .",
    "this agrees with the value of 56 s for this star found by @xcite , and confirms that hd 186355 is still in the shell hydrogen - burning phase .",
    "this value also agrees with our models .",
    "we note that measuring the period spacings may also provide a method to determine the size of the convective core of those helium - burning red giants @xcite .",
    "to make use of this extra information , we took frequencies of those @xmath4 mixed modes with relatively low theoretical mode inertias into calculation .",
    "about 12 @xmath51 modes were used for each model , giving a total of around 24 frequencies .",
    "these produced the values labelled @xmath52 in table  [ tb : chi ] .",
    "again the best model is the one with 1.43 @xmath44 , but now the models with higher masses have large deviations between observed and theoretical oscillation frequencies . in particular , the 1.6 @xmath44 model is ruled out after this calculation .",
    "we search for models with @xmath52 smaller than 30 and determine the mass to be 1.45 @xmath2 0.05 @xmath44 .",
    "we have analysed the time series data sets of the star hd 186355 from _ kepler _  to obtain its oscillation parameters . by using the scaling relations between @xmath1 , @xmath0 and the stellar effective temperature @xmath6 we estimated the stellar mass as 1.41 @xmath2 0.14 @xmath3 . in order to determine the stellar global properties more accurately , we computed a set of models to compare with the observational constraints .",
    "the best model was found having a mass of 1.43 @xmath44 , which agrees with the scaling value , and @xmath39 of 0.012 , and the stellar mass is constrained to be 1.45 @xmath2 0.05 @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , parameters such as age , effective temperature , luminosity and radius are also determined after comparison ( see model with mass of 1.43 @xmath44 in table  [ tb : chi ] ) .",
    "we also obtain the observed mean period spacing of @xmath4 modes with a value of 58 @xmath2 4 s. from the modelled evolutionary track of hd 186355 , we know it is in the shell hydrogen - burning phase and on the ascending giant branch , which is consistent with the results of @xcite on the mean period spacings of mixed modes for red giants .",
    "the authors acknowledge the _ kepler _  science team for their work to provide us with these great data .",
    "funding for the _ kepler _  discovery mission is provided by nasa s science mission directorate .",
