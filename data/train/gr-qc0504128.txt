    "in the past several years , there has been substantial progress in gravitational wave detection experiments by the ground - based laser interferometers , ligo  @xcite , tama300  @xcite , geo600  @xcite and virgo  @xcite .",
    "the ligo and tama collaborations are conducting joint searches for gravitational waves in the ligo science run 2 ( s2 ) and tama300 data taking run 8 ( dt8 ) data , which was taken from february 14 to april 14 , 2003 .",
    "three classes of gravitational wave transients are being sought : unmodeled gravitational wave bursts from the gamma ray burst event grb 030329  @xcite ; unmodeled gravitational wave bursts without an electromagnetic trigger  @xcite ; inspiral signals from galactic binary neutron star ( bns ) systems .    in this paper , we present the status of the joint search for gravitational waves from inspiraling neutron star binaries by the ligo and tama collaborations .",
    "we focus on what has been learned from a subset ( 10% ) of the full coincident data set , chosen to be representative of the full data set in term of detector contribution and noise , and reserved for tuning of the analysis pipeline .",
    "we refer to this as the playground data .",
    "we use the observable effective distance to characterize the sensitivity of the instruments to binary neutron star inspirals .",
    "this is defined as the distance at which an inspiral of @xmath0@xmath1 neutron stars , in the optimal direction and orientation with respect to each detector , would produce a signal to noise ratio ( snr ) of 8 .",
    "the effective distance is always greater than or equal to the actual distance , and on average is @xmath2 times as large as the distance . in table",
    "[ tab : obseve_dist ] , we show the observable effective distance of the three ligo instruments ( h1 , h2 and l1 ) and the tama300 instrument ( t1 ) during s2 and dt8 . since the ligo and tama300 detectors were sensitive to the majority of the milky way , it is possible for us to detect an inspiral signal from our galaxy . if we do not make a detection , then we can place an upper limit on the binary neutron star inspiral rate in the milky way .",
    "another motivation for this work is to gain experience in performing coincident analyses between different groups , and to establish the analysis method .",
    ".the observable effective distance , during the s2 and dt8 , at which an inspiral of 1.4 - 1.4 @xmath3 neutron stars , in the optimal direction and orientation with respect to each detector , would produce the snr of 8 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     each group analyzes its own data , generating a `` trigger '' when an inspiral candidate appears in the data stream .",
    "the groups then exchange triggers and search for coincidences .",
    "both ligo and tama300 have performed independent analyses on the s2/dt8 data set and they have been described in detail elsewhere @xcite . in this paper , we will focus on aspects of the coincident search . using the playground data",
    ", we define a set of coincidence requirements between triggers from the two detectors . before we perform the coincident analysis using these coincidence conditions , they are tested by performing software injections of simulated inspiral signals into the data and by checking the detection efficiency .",
    "we verify that the injection efficiency is consistent with the observable effective distances stated in table  [ tab : obseve_dist ] . finally , using a technique of artificially shifting the time series with respect to one another",
    ", we estimate the coincident triggers produced accidentally by the instrumental noise .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : detector_data_set ] , we describe the ligo and tama300 detectors and the data sets to be analyzed . in section [ sec : analysis_playground ] , we briefly describe the single instrument playground analysis . in section",
    "[ sec : condition ] , we discuss the method of coincident analysis using the results of the single - detector searches . in section [ sec : back_etc ] , we estimate the background of coincident triggers using a time slide analysis and test the efficiency of our search using simulations .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] summarizes the paper .",
    "the ligo network of detectors consists of a 4 km interferometer `` l1''in livingston , la and a 4 km `` h1 '' and a 2 km `` h2 '' interferometer which share a common vacuum system in hanford , wa .",
    "tama300 is a 300 m interferometer `` t1 '' in mitaka , tokyo .",
    "basic information on the position , orientation of these detectors and detailed descriptions of their operation can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the data analyzed in this search was taken during ligo s2 , tama300 dt8 , between 16:00 utc 14 february 2003 and 16:00 utc 14 april 2003 .",
    "we only analyze data from the periods when both ligo and tama300 interferometers were operating .",
    "furthermore , we restrict to times when only one of the ligo sites was operational , thus sharing no common observational time with the ligo only search discussed in @xcite . therefore , we have four independent data sets to analyze : the data set during which neither h1 nor h2 were operating , the nh1-nh2-l1-t1 coincident data set ( here `` n '' stands for `` not operating '' ) ; and three data sets when one or both of the hanford detectors were operational but l1 was not  the h1-nh2-nl1-t1 coincident data set ; the nh1-h2-nl1-t1 coincident data set ; and the h1-h2-nl1-t1 coincident data set .",
    "the total length of data was 650 hours .",
    "this comprised 334 hours of h1-h2-t1 data , 212 hours of h1-t1 data , 68 hours of h2-t1 data and 36 hours of l1-t1 data . to avoid any bias from tuning our pipeline using the same data from which we derive our upper limits , the tuning of analysis parameters was done without examining the full coincident trigger sets . instead , preliminary",
    "tuning was done on the playground data , which will not be used placing the upper limit . in this analysis ,",
    "the length of playground data was 64 hours .",
    "our analysis methodology is similar , though not identical , to that used in the ligo analysis @xcite and the tama300-lism coincident analysis @xcite . we analyze the data from each detector independently , identifying candidate inspiral events in the data streams which we refer to as `` triggers '' .",
    "we then search for coincidences within the lists of triggers from each interferometer . here",
    ", we will only briefly review the main steps in the single instrument analyses .",
    "the search methods employed by tama300 are discussed in greater detail in @xcite and by ligo in @xcite .    for each instrument",
    "we produce a bank of inspiral templates with the 2pn expansion for ligo  @xcite and the 2.5pn expansion for tama300 @xcite , distinguished by the masses ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) of the two neutron stars in the binary .",
    "we then filtered the data stream through this bank of templates and record a trigger whenever the snr exceeds 7 . in order to minimise the number of spurious triggers",
    ", we also perform a test of waveform consistency ( the @xmath6 test  @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , during times when both hanford detectors are operational , we check for coincidence between h1 and h2 . in the playground data , there were no such triggers .",
    "however , if a trigger is seen in h1 and its amplitude , or estimated effective distance , is such that we would not expect to see it in h2 , we keep this h1 trigger even with no coincident trigger in h2 ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "the triggers from each instrument are characterized by the time of coalescence @xmath7 , the chirp mass @xmath8 , the symmetric mass ratio ( dimensionless ) @xmath9 , ( @xmath10 is the total mass of the binary system ) , the signal to noise ratio @xmath11 , value of the @xmath12 test and effective distance @xmath13 .",
    "the effective distance of a waveform is the distance for which a binary neutron star system would produce the waveform if it were optimally oriented .",
    "the lists of triggers are then exchanged between the ligo and tama analysis groups and coincident triggers are searched for .",
    "true gravitational wave events , if sufficiently loud , will appear in the trigger lists of both the ligo and tama300 instruments .",
    "however , they will have somewhat different values of parameters such as coalescence time and chirp mass . this is due to the detectors noise , the difference in the detectors locations and arm orientations , and the discrete sampling of the mass parameter space by the template bank . to evaluate the accuracy with which we can determine various parameters , we perform monte carlo simulations of injected signals . our sample population for simulations consisted of galactic neutron star binaries with masses in the range @xmath14 .",
    "for the simulations , the spatial and mass distributions were taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we set coincidence windows to maximize our detection efficiency while reducing the number of chance coincidences . in the ligo ",
    "tama300 search we require coincidence in both time and chirp mass .",
    "we require the coalescence time @xmath7 of a signal to be consistent between the ligo and tama300 detectors .",
    "the allowed time difference is determined by our accuracy in determining @xmath7 and the light travel time between the sites . to determine our timing accuracy , we inject simulated gravitational wave signals into the data streams from each detector , and re - analyze the data .",
    "we injected 660 signals in tama300 data and 455 signals in ligo data .",
    "we compared the injected time and the detected time which was obtained from our search pipeline .",
    "we define the detected time to be the time of the loudest trigger within 3 ms of the coalescence time of the injection .",
    "we show the accuracy of coalescence time ; detected - injected coalescence time in figs .",
    "[ fig : l_acc_tc ] and [ fig : t_acc_tc ] .",
    "we find that nearly all injections into both ligo and tama300 data have triggers ( @xmath15 ) recorded within @xmath16 ms of the injection time .",
    "[ 0.4 ] for simulated injections into ligo data .",
    "all of the 455 injected signals were seen ( @xmath15 ) in the ligo data , and the coalescence time of the majority of them was recorded within @xmath16 ms of the injection coalescence time.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ 0.4 ] for simulated injections into tama300 data . out of the 660 injections into tama300 data , 516 produced triggers ( @xmath15 ) . for the majority of these injections ,",
    "the coalescence time was recorded within @xmath17 ms of the injection time .",
    "the other simulated signals injected into tama300 data did not produce triggers because they were too weak to be detected by tama300.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the distance between the tama300 site and the ligo hanford site is 7487 km .",
    "the distance between the tama300 site and the ligo livingston site is 9703 km . because gravitational waves travel at the speed of light , the maximum delay of the arrival time of gravitational wave signals are @xmath18 for tama300hanford and @xmath19 for tama300livingston .",
    "based on these facts , we define the allowed difference in coalescence time @xmath20 by the maximum time delay of signal plus the uncertainty in determining the coalescence time . the values are @xmath21 therefore , if the coalescence times , @xmath22 for tama300 and @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 h or l ) for ligo , of a trigger satisfy , @xmath25 the trigger is recorded as a candidate event .",
    "the accuracy with which we can determine the chirp mass is determined in the same way as for the coalescence time ; namely by adding simulated signals into the data of the instruments . as with the end time",
    ", we take the detected chirp mass to be the chirp mass of the loudest trigger obtained within 3 ms of the end of the injection . in figs .",
    "[ fig : l_acc_mass ] and [ fig : t_acc_mass ] , we find that the chirp mass of an injected signal is recorded with an accuracy of @xmath26 in the ligo instruments and @xmath27 in tama300 .",
    "we define the allowed difference in chirp mass of coincident triggers between ligo and tama300 to be :    @xmath28    if the chirp mass , @xmath29 for tama300 and @xmath30 ( where @xmath24 h or l ) for ligo , of a trigger satisfies , @xmath31 the trigger is recorded as a candidate event .",
    "[ 0.4 ] for simulated injections into ligo data .",
    "the majority of the 455 injections into ligo data have triggers ( @xmath15 ) recorded with chirp mass within @xmath26 of the chirp mass of the injected signal .",

    "the majority have triggers ( @xmath15 ) recorded with chirp mass within @xmath27 of the chirp mass of injected signal .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "before doing the coincidence search , we study the background events by performing a time slide analysis of the data .",
    "additionally , we evaluate the search efficiency by performing an injection analysis .",
    "we check that the injection efficiency is consistent with the sensitivities of the instruments reported in table  [ tab : obseve_dist ] .      even in the absence of gravitational wave signals",
    ", we expect that some noise triggers will be coincident by chance .",
    "we can estimate the number of such accidental coincident triggers by performing our coincidence analysis on the data with artificial relative time shifts added  @xcite .",
    "we performed 100 time slides of @xmath32 sec of the ligo triggers relative to the tama300 triggers .",
    "these slides are much longer than the light travel time between the sites , so that any coincidence can not be from actual gravitational wave .",
    "they are also longer than the detector noise auto - correlation time , longer than the longest signal template duration and shorter than timescales of detectors non - stationarity , so that each time slide provides an independent estimate of the accidental coincident rate . additionally , the triggers are clustered over a 100 ms window .",
    "the signal to noise ratios @xmath33 vs @xmath34 of the accidental coincident triggers found in the playground data is shown in fig  [ fig : scatter_acc_coin ] . from these time slides ,",
    "we obtain an estimated false alarm rate of 0.4 triggers per day .    [ 0.4 ] vs @xmath34 of the accidental coincident triggers , in playground data , using 100 time slides.,title=\"fig : \" ]      we performed a set of coherent injections into the data of both tama300 and the ligo instruments in order to test our coincidence windows and determine the search efficiency .",
    "overall , this consisted of 381 injections in times when tama300 and one of the ligo sites were operational .",
    "these injections were same as those described in section [ sec : condition ] used for determining the coincidence parameters . among the 381 injections ,",
    "297 events produced coincident triggers in the two instruments .",
    "of the 84 injections which were not found by the coincidence analysis , only one injection was found separately by both ligo and tama300 .",
    "however , in tama300 , the chirp mass was recovered with an error of @xmath35 , while ligo recovered it with an error of less than @xmath36 .",
    "hence , although a trigger was found in both instruments , it did not pass the chirp mass coincidence requirement .",
    "the other 83 missed injection signals were not detected by tama300 with @xmath37 and @xmath6 below threshold .",
    "we have checked that the missed injections are actually very distant signals for tama300 . to do this , we plot the effective distance versus gmst for the found and missed injections in fig .  [",
    "fig : distance ] .",
    "it is clear that the majority of missed injections are too distant for tama300 to detect .",
    "we also plot the efficiency versus effective distance in fig.[fig : eff_hist ] .",
    "we find that the efficiency is very close to 100% within 50 kpc and then drops off steeply .",
