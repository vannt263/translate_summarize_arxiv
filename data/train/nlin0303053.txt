    "<S> we semiclassically derive the leading off - diagonal correction to the spectral form factor of quantum systems with a chaotic classical counterpart . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we present a phase space generalization of a recent approach for uniformly hyperbolic systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results coincide with corresponding random matrix predictions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we study the transition from the gaussian orthogonal to the gaussian unitary ensemble .    </S>",
    "<S> advanced semiclassical methods have been very successful to significantly improve our understanding of complex , classically chaotic quantum systems@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this holds particularly true for observables which can be deduced from the ( single - particle ) green function of the quantum system , such as the density of states , photo absorption , or orbital magnetism , to name a few . </S>",
    "<S> however , for quantities which are based on green function products the situation is much more involved . </S>",
    "<S> these include linear response functions , e.g.  for quantum transport , spectral correlation functions or , more generally , spectral statistics . a semiclassical treatment of such quantities is usually faced with the serious problem of evaluating multiple infinite sums over phase - carrying classical paths , which arise from the semiclassical representation of the green functions in the limit @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> a prominent example is the spectral two - point correlator or its fourier transform the spectral form factor @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> random matrix assumptions leading to the prediction of a universal form for @xmath1 for classically chaotic quantum systems are supported by experimental and numerical data for a vast number of systems from different disciplines in physics @xcite . nevertheless , a corresponding analytical approach proving the conjectured @xcite universality by explicitly including the underlying chaotic classical dynamics is still lacking . in this respect </S>",
    "<S> semiclassical techniques , bridging classical and quantum dynamics , appear to be natural tools but have to cope with the above mentioned problems when evaluating spectral correlations . for the form factor this involves the computation of ( energy ) averaged double sums over periodic orbits which has been addressed in several semiclassical approaches @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , @xmath1 was semiclassically investigated for uniformly hyperbolic two - dimensional systems where the classical dynamics is governed by a single lyapunov exponent @xcite . by going beyond the usual diagonal approximation @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath2 , describing the limit of spectral long - range correlations ) , the next to leading order contribution to @xmath1 was computed for systems with time - reversal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this was achieved by identifying off - diagonal pairs of correlated periodic orbits which are associated with each other via selfcrossings in configuration space . </S>",
    "<S> based on this orbit class the random matrix theory ( rmt ) prediction for the form factor in the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) , @xmath3 for @xmath4 , could be derived @xcite , see also @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the important question remains whether the above result , as well as the rmt prediction , are specific for systems with uniformly hyperbolic dynamics , or whether they pertain for the much broader class of chaotic systems with different periodic orbits having different lyapunov exponents .    </S>",
    "<S> here we present a generalization of the semiclassical approach outlined above to such non - uniformly hyperbolic systems in two dimensions and show that under rather general conditions the term @xmath5 in @xmath1 is indeed retained . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we develop a canonically invariant approach which is based on phase space arguments only . </S>",
    "<S> we identify as the relevant objects crossing regions in phase space which can involve more than one selfcrossing in configuration space . </S>",
    "<S> we express the action differences of the considered orbit pairs in terms of local phase space properties , the directions of the stable and unstable manifolds , and present a method for counting the crossing regions. this allows us eventually to determine their contribution to @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the semiclassical limit implies a large energy @xmath6 compared to the mean level spacing @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy dependence of @xmath1 is smoothed out by an average over a classically small but quantum mechanically large energy window of size @xmath8 . in the considered limit @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> can be chosen such that @xmath9 . in this energy regime </S>",
    "<S> all classical actions , such as the action @xmath10 of the shortest periodic orbit , are much larger than @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath12 . then one can employ gutzwiller s trace formula @xcite for the oscillating part of the density of states and evaluate the fourier transform of the spectral two - point correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> this gives for the form factor a double sum over periodic orbits @xcite , @xmath13 with the time scaled according to @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the heisenberg time . </S>",
    "<S> we represent each periodic orbit @xmath16 in terms of its phase space coordinates @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are </S>",
    "<S> the position and momentum coordinates in two dimensions . in ( [ k_tau ] ) , @xmath20 is the period of an orbit @xmath21 and @xmath22 includes both , its weight and maslov index . </S>",
    "<S> the action difference between two orbits @xmath21 and @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the argument of the double sum is a rapidly oscillating function and hence the energy average suppresses most of the terms . to obtain a nonvanishing contribution to @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> the action difference must be small , i.e. @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for the time reversal case , the largest contribution is due to pairs of one path @xmath21 with itself or its time - reversed partner @xmath26 with vanishing action difference . including only this type of pairs , known as the diagonal approximation @xcite , reproduces the linear contribution @xmath27 .    in the recent approach beyond the diagonal approximation pairs of closely related periodic orbits with a small action difference </S>",
    "<S> have been constructed by analyzing self - crossings of the orbits in configuration space @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we proceed in a different way by generalizing the approach via self - crossings to crossing regions in phase space : we will show that if a periodic orbit @xmath21 comes close to its time - reversed version @xmath28 in such a crossing region this can imply the existence of yet another periodic orbit @xmath29 with a small action difference @xmath30 between the two . </S>",
    "<S> the partner orbit @xmath31 follows the original @xmath21 in a first segment @xmath32 and then the time - reversed path @xmath28 during the rest of the time in the second segment @xmath33 , see figure [ fig_partner ] . </S>",
    "<S> it will turn out that not every crossing region implies the existence of a partner orbit and therefore a small number of non - relevant crossing regions has to be excluded .    to compute the contribution of the described orbit pairs @xmath34 to @xmath1 we rearrange ( [ k_tau ] ) into a sum over periodic orbits and another sum over all the partners with small action difference . </S>",
    "<S> this is based on the assumption that the dominant off - diagonal contribution to @xmath1 , equation  ( [ k_tau ] ) , is due to the systematic correlation of actions of the considered orbit pairs @xmath34 while other correlations are negligible </S>",
    "<S> . then we sort the terms in the sums with respect to their action differences . </S>",
    "<S> since the orbit length @xmath20 is proportional to @xmath35 for fixed @xmath36 , one expects a large number of crossing regions for each orbit . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to replace the sum over action differences @xmath24 by an integral . </S>",
    "<S> the first off - diagonal contribution to @xmath1 then reads @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number of relevant crossing regions for a given periodic orbit @xmath21 with an associated action difference smaller than @xmath39 . in equation  ( [ k2_tau ] ) , @xmath40 denotes a weighted average over all orbits @xmath21 of given length @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> it is defined as @xmath42 we proceed with the evaluation of ( [ k2_tau ] ) by first determining the geometry of the partner orbit @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> then we show that the action difference between @xmath21 and @xmath43 is indeed small if the orbit @xmath21 and its time - reversed version @xmath44 come close together in parts of the phase space . </S>",
    "<S> finally we derive the averaged number @xmath45 of relevant crossing regions in the contributing regime @xmath46 . _ partner geometry . _ to construct the partner orbit we analyse the linearised equations of motion around @xmath21 in part @xmath32 and around @xmath28 in section @xmath33 in the poincar surface of section ( pss ) , see figure [ figure1 ] , and show that a nontrivial solution representing the partner orbit @xmath31 exists under certain conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the distance between the original orbit @xmath21 and its time - reversed partner @xmath28 in the pss defined by the local transverse coordinates at the phase space position @xmath47 is given by the vector @xmath48 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in general , the time evolution of a small deviation is determined by the starting point @xmath49 of the original path in phase space and the initial deviation in the pss @xmath50 , e.g. @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> let us assume for the moment that the crossing region under consideration is characterized by a small distance @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> decomposing @xmath53 in terms of the local unstable and stable manifolds @xmath54 @xcite with the expansion coefficients @xmath55 the smallness of @xmath52 is given if @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> for simplicity we choose the relative orientation and lengths of the @xmath54 such that @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> it will turn out that @xmath56 is the relevant regime for the evaluation of @xmath1 in the semiclassical limit . </S>",
    "<S> the distance between @xmath21 and the partner orbit @xmath31 at the beginning of the first loop @xmath32 is denoted by @xmath58 , see figure [ fig_pss ] . </S>",
    "<S> this vector lies in the pss defined at the phase space position @xmath47 before the loop @xmath32 [ this corresponds to the upper crossing region in figure [ fig_partner ] ] . having passed loop @xmath32 after time @xmath59 this distance has changed to @xmath60 with @xmath61 being the stability matrix for loop @xmath32 . before ( and after ) </S>",
    "<S> the other part of the orbit the difference between the time - reversed path @xmath28 and the partner @xmath31 is denoted by @xmath62 ( and @xmath63 ) where @xmath64 is the stability matrix of the time - reversed loop @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix @xmath65 is defined as @xmath66 solving the linearised equations of motion under the condition that the two parts of the partner orbit fit together in the crossing regions yields the geometry of @xmath43 in terms of the distance @xmath52 between the original orbit @xmath21 and its time - reversed @xmath28 : @xmath67^{-1 } \\left [ 1 - l^i f \\right ] \\delta \\vec{y}.\\ ] ] the corresponding condition for @xmath62 for the lower crossing region in figure [ fig_partner ] is found in a similar way @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this set of solutions @xmath68 includes terms of order @xmath69 and defines the partner orbit for a given small @xmath52 representing a crossing region.    we now argue that a crossing region does not yield a partner if the periodic orbit @xmath21 lies close to a self - retracing path during one of the loops . </S>",
    "<S> this type of crossing region is described by a @xmath70 such that the original path @xmath21 and the time - reversed @xmath28 stay close together with @xmath71 holding during the entire loop @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the motion of the time - reversed path @xmath28 in @xmath32 can then be obtained by linearisation around the original @xmath21 using the stability matrix @xmath61 . in this case one </S>",
    "<S> finds @xmath72 neglecting corrections of higher then first order in @xmath73 . the solution ( [ geometry ] ) is then replaced by @xmath74 and @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> it therefore does not give a new partner orbit but just the time - reversed periodic orbit @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> but contributions to @xmath1 of this type are already treated in the diagonal approximation and must not be included in ( [ k2_tau ] ) . however , because of the hyperbolic nature of the dynamics the condition @xmath77 holds true for the entire loop @xmath32 only if the loop time @xmath78 is smaller than a certain minimal time @xmath79 , i.e. @xmath80 . corresponding arguments involving the time @xmath81 hold for the other loop @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> these minimal times @xmath82 are determined by the time scale on which the linearization breaks down and are implicitly given by the condition @xmath83 where the @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) sign corresponds to @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) and @xmath88 are constants of order one . since ( [ geometry ] ) uniquely defines the partner orbit as sketched in figure [ fig_partner ] one can show that the maslov index for the orbit @xmath21 equals that of @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the maslov index of a periodic orbit is given by the winding number of the stable or unstable manifold @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the partner orbit is close to the original orbit in section @xmath32 the contribution to the winding number accumulated between the two crossing regions is the same for both . </S>",
    "<S> the second contribution comes from loop @xmath33 and is thus given by the geometry @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the total winding number for @xmath89 , the sum of these two contributions , can be related to the total winding number of @xmath90 in the following way . </S>",
    "<S> time reversal symmetry implies the relation @xmath91 between the manifolds of @xmath21 and @xmath28 . with this relation </S>",
    "<S> one can show that the contributions to the winding number coming from @xmath44 and @xmath21 during @xmath33 are equal . </S>",
    "<S> then the equality of the maslov indices of @xmath21 and @xmath31 becomes evident @xcite if one uses similar arguments as in the proof of the equality of the maslov indices of a periodic orbit and its time reversed counterpart @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ action difference . _ </S>",
    "<S> the geometry of the partner given by ( [ geometry ] ) allows one to derive the action difference between the two orbits of the pair @xmath92 as a function of @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> since the distance @xmath52 is assumed to be small it is sufficient to expand the action in @xmath52 . however , the expression one obtains for @xmath39 @xcite still contains all the elements of the stability matrices @xmath61 and @xmath93 because the geometry of the partner orbit as given by ( [ geometry ] ) depends on them . </S>",
    "<S> since the existence of the partner implies loop lengths larger than @xmath94 the vectors @xmath95 have to lie very close to the respective local stable or unstable manifolds , e.g. @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> this fact enables us to express the action difference @xmath24 between the original orbit @xmath21 and the partner orbit @xmath97 in terms of the local manifolds @xcite and the expansion coefficients @xmath98 given by ( [ y_coefficients ] ) . under the assumption that the directions of the manifolds are continuous functions of the position in phase space @xcite the result then reads @xmath99 which is correct up to second order in @xmath52 . in the semiclassical limit it is sufficient to consider the regime given by @xmath100 which justifies the above restriction to small values of @xmath101 .    </S>",
    "<S> the equations ( [ geometry ] ) representing the geometry of @xmath89 and ( [ action ] ) are invariant under a shift of the pss along the orbit within a crossing region. this also implies that a crossing region may include several selfcrossings in configuration space and hence the number of partners is not necessarily given by the number of selfcrossings as it was the case for the uniformly hyperbolic systems @xcite . _ counting crossing regions. _ moving the pss along @xmath21 each crossing region </S>",
    "<S> is characterized by a @xmath52 that starts close to @xmath102 and ends almost parallel to @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> the number of crossing regions can thus be determined by counting how often the unstable components @xmath86 of the vectors @xmath52 go through a certain fixed value @xmath104 as one moves along @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> this parameter @xmath104 fixes the position within the crossing regions used to identify and count it . </S>",
    "<S> the total number of crossing regions must not depend on @xmath104 and it will be shown that this is indeed the case .    to evaluate the weighted average ( [ avg_n ] ) of the number @xmath105 of contributing crossing regions we make use of the following sum rule @xcite valid for ergodic systems @xmath106 it relates the weighted average of a function @xmath107 over all periodic orbits of length @xmath108 to a time average over a generic ergodic trajectory @xmath109 starting at any @xmath49 in phase space . to apply ( [ sum_rule ] ) in the calculation of ( [ avg_n ] ) </S>",
    "<S> one writes the number of events where the time reversed path comes close to the original one as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the density of partners per action in the pss located at @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath113 describes the velocity of the flow in the pss so that ( [ local_number ] ) indeed gives the number of partners per action and time . in expression ( [ local_number ] ) the position in the pss is specified in terms of @xmath39 and @xmath104 using ( [ action ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the density @xmath114 is determined by the probability that the time reversed path goes through the point @xmath115 in the pss defined at @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> the long time limit is thus given by the ergodic density @xmath116 with @xmath117 being the volume of the energy surface in phase space . </S>",
    "<S> however , since certain crossing regions with short loop lengths characterized by @xmath118 , see ( [ t_min ] ) , do not yield a partner one has to exclude parts of the time reversed path of length @xmath119\\ ] ] with the factor @xmath120 coming from time reversal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> according to definition ( [ t_min ] ) this time @xmath121 is determined by the time it takes for the unstable component @xmath86 to grow from the small value @xmath122 to the value @xmath123 . </S>",
    "<S> it therefore does not depend on @xmath104 . to compute ( [ avg_n ] ) </S>",
    "<S> we first apply ( [ sum_rule ] ) to ( [ local_number ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> one finds that it is this logarithmic correction to the ergodic behaviour that gives the rmt result @xmath132    _ goe - gue transition . _ </S>",
    "<S> the crossover between the universality classes as time reversal symmetry is broken has been originally semiclassically obtained in ref.@xcite within the diagonal approximation . here </S>",
    "<S> we summarize a dynamical evaluation of this transition for the first off - diagonal correction . </S>",

    "<S> we shall consider the case where the symmetry is broken by a uniform magnetic field @xmath134 perpendicular to a uniformly hyperbolic two - dimensional system . </S>",
    "<S> since for an orbit pair @xmath92 one of the common loops ( @xmath33 or @xmath32 ) between the crossing regions are traversed in opposite direction in configuration space , the orbit pair acquires , owing to the overall magnetic flux enclosed , an additional action difference @xmath135 . here </S>",
