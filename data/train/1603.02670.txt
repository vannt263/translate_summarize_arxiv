    "gravity in dimensions greater than four has provided an interesting setup to explore whether or not many of the properties that black holes have in four dimensions are intrinsic to these kinds of spacetimes .",
    "according to string theory , which provides a quantum theory containing a massless , spin-2 field , the introduction of higher dimensions is actually a necessity and , in a perturbative approach , einstein - hilbert action acquires corrections with terms that contain higher powers in the curvature that modify the short distance dynamic of the theory .",
    "even more , maldacena s conjecture @xcite , which was stated in the realm of string theory and applies to the more general setup of gauge / gravity duality , states that gravity in asymptotically anti de sitter spacetimes in @xmath1 dimensions is equivalent to a conformal field theory living in dimension @xmath2 .",
    "these reasons have led in the last decades to a vast exploration of gravity in higher dimensions and , in particular , to the study of black holes in such scenarios ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "a family of configurations that are intrinsic to dimensions greater than four are the asymptotically flat homogeneous black strings in general relativity .",
    "given the fact that the direct product of ricci - flat manifolds is still ricci - flat , one can add to the line element of the schwarzschild - tangherlini spacetime in @xmath3 dimensions @xcite , the line element of a locally flat space , obtaining black holes with horizon topologies given by @xmath4 in @xmath5 dimensions , which receive the name of black strings in the case @xmath6 and black @xmath7-branes in general . without a cosmological constant ,",
    "there are no black holes in general relativity in three - dimensions ( @xmath8 ) ; therefore the black @xmath7-brane solutions exist only in dimensions greater than or equal to five , and they have to be added to the now vast zoo of solutions of gravity in vacuum in higher dimensions that contains black rings @xcite , black saturns @xcite , and other configurations .",
    "since these extended black objects do hawking radiate , it is natural to compare their entropy to determine which of the phases of gravity in higher dimensions dominates for a given mass .",
    "this comparison shows that there is a critical mass above which the black strings have more entropy than the corresponding spherical black hole and below which the black hole is the one possessing a larger entropy @xcite .",
    "this led gregory and laflamme to look for the existence of a perturbative instability of the black strings @xcite .",
    "indeed , they showed that these configurations are linearly unstable against long wavelength perturbations traveling along the black strings and @xmath7-branes .",
    "since this is a linearized perturbative instability , no dynamical information can be extracted from the analysis to state which is the final stage configuration . in order to form a set of black holes from the black string",
    "the event horizon must pinch off , giving access to an external observer to the singularity .",
    "horowitz and maeda @xcite proved that such a pinch off can not occur in a finite affine parameter along the horizon generator and therefore conjecture the existence of nonhomogeneous black strings as possible end points of the gregory - laflamme ( gl ) instability .",
    "these configurations were constructed perturbatively @xcite and numerically @xcite , but all of those happen to have less entropy than the homogeneous black string , and therefore can not be the end point of the instability . for weakly nonhomogeneous solutions",
    "it was shown that there is a critical dimension @xmath9 below which the homogeneous string carries more entropy and above which the nonhomogeneous one has a larger entropy @xcite ( later it was shown that by boosting the black string one can modify this critical dimension @xcite ) .",
    "the question of the final stage of the gl instability was open , until the series of works @xcite , which culminate in the work by lehner and pretorius @xcite .",
    "after an outstanding numerical effort , these works showed that the perturbed five dimensional black string evolve towards a set of spherical black holes connected by black strings and even more , for a finite time for an asymptotic observer , the radius of the cylinders may shrink to zero and the system may than develop a null naked singularity , providing a counterexample to cosmic censorship in five dimensions without fine - tuning on the initial data .",
    "no further study of the final point of the gl instability was done in a different setup until recently , when the large @xmath1 expansion @xcite was used to show that , at leading order in @xmath10 , the black string instability leads to a nonhomogeneous black string as a final stage @xcite , which is consistent with the existence of a finite critical dimension @xmath11 .",
    "one expects that when the radius of the horizon decreases enough , higher curvature terms might play a role in the evolution of the perturbation and therefore it would be interesting to explore the effect of higher curvature terms in the existence and evolution of black strings .",
    "from all the possible higher curvature terms , there is a particular family that is singled out by requiring second - order field equations as well as diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "these terms are known as lovelock terms @xcite and are labeled by the order @xmath12 of the curvature .",
    "the cosmological and the einstein - hilbert terms are the first two in the lovelock family and correspond to @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the first nontrivial member of the lovelock family is quadratic in the curvature ( @xmath15 ) , is known as the gauss - bonnet term , and it contributes to the field equations only in dimensions @xmath16 .",
    "something similar occurs for the remaining terms of order @xmath12 , which produce nontrivial field equations only for dimension @xmath17 . since these terms have second - order field equations , they are devoid of ostrogradsky instabilities , and therefore it is natural to explore their effect on the perturbative black string instability even in regimes where they may completely dominate the dynamics . in the gauss - bonnet case",
    "different aspects of this problem have been studied .",
    "approximate black string solutions were constructed numerically in @xcite-@xcite . in particular in @xcite",
    "weakly nonhomogeneous static black strings were constructed for einstein - gauss - bonnet theory and the authors provided evidence for the relation between perturbative and thermal instability in this scenario .",
    "for the theory containing only the gauss - bonnet term , one can construct black strings and @xmath7-branes by simply adding flat directions to the black holes found in @xcite .",
    "this was done simultaneously in refs . @xcite and @xcite where it was shown as well that by comparing entropies one must expect a gl instability for the black strings and @xmath7-branes of sufficiently low adm mass .",
    "since perturbation theory in higher curvature gravity presents subtleties ( see , for example , @xcite-@xcite for studies of black hole perturbations ) , the perturbative search for the gl instability of the solutions constructed in @xcite-@xcite has been only recently carried out in @xcite .",
    "there , it was shown that the black string in gauss - bonnet theory ( no einstein term ) in seven dimensions was unstable under s - wave modes and that the instability is present above a certain critical wavelength , in a similar fashion to general relativity .",
    "less is known for third - order lovelock theory .",
    "the spherically symmetric black hole solution can be extracted from wheeler s polynomial in @xcite , which turns out to be the unique spherically symmetric solution for generic values of the coupling constants as shown by birkhoff s theorem @xcite .",
    "some early papers also explored the compactifications of the cubic lovelock terms @xcite , as well as some more recent papers constructing wormholes @xcite or exploring the thermodynamics of asymptotically ads solutions in vacuum or with different types of matter fields @xcite ( see also @xcite for a thorough analysis of wheeler s polynomial and some holographic considerations of third - order lovelock theory ) .    the existence of a perturbative black string instability for third - order lovelock gravity has not been explored at all , and it is the purpose of this paper to partially contribute to that gap . as mentioned above , in order to construct homogeneous black strings by simply adding a line to a given black hole , one can consider the lovelock terms separately . to simplify the problem",
    "we consider the third - order lovelock theory in nine dimensions , which is the lowest dimension in which this can be done for @xmath18 .",
    "the analysis of @xcite-@xcite provided an entropic argument for the instability of black strings with mass below a certain critical mass , and here we show that such black strings are indeed perturbatively unstable against long wavelength perturbations and that the dispersion relation for the instability is qualitatively similar to the gregory - laflamme instability in general relativity .",
    "even more , for a given black hole radius in the transverse section of the black string , we compare the maximum exponential growths and the critical wavelengths of the instabilities of the solutions of general relativity , gauss - bonnet and third - order lovelock theory in nine dimensions .",
    "we find that the maximum critical wave number at which the instability is triggered decreases with the order of the lovelock theory as well as the maximum exponential growth .",
    "this comparison is done for a fixed radius of the horizon instead than for a fixed mass since the former is a geometric quantity that can be defined independently of the dynamics that governs gravity and is therefore suitable for comparing ",

    "iii we present the perturbative analysis for an s - wave on the nine - dimensional black string for third - order lovelock theory , and show that the string is unstable under long wavelength perturbations .",

    "the same occurs for the components @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "it is interesting to see that the previous analysis has been done without imposing any gauge - fixing condition .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to analyze whether or not the unstable modes we have found are physical . as was done for black strings in gauss - bonnet in seven dimensions , this can be done easily by considering the following scalar invariant : @xmath82 this scalar identically vanishes on the unperturbed black string ( [ eq : bsp ] ) .",

    "we have proved that for the first three homogeneous terms on lovelock theories , it is possible to construct homogeneous black strings that are unstable under gravitational perturbations on each theory . given the wavelength of the perturbation as well as the rate of the exponential growth of the corresponding instability , for a given radius of the black hole in the transverse section of the string , one could wonder if it is possible to determine which is the dynamics that drove the instability .",
    "such comparison makes sense only if kinematical quantities are involved , since the strength of the gravitational interaction on each theory depends on the value of the gravitational coupling , which might be different in each case .",
    "the radius of the horizon , being a purely geometrical quantity , provides us with a good parameter to perform the mentioned comparison .",
    "now we present some details of the computations that allow one to determine which gravity theory destabilizes a black string of radius @xmath84 faster . + in order to fix the ideas , let us again consider a black string in @xmath0 , for @xmath85 and @xmath86 , i.e. , for pure einstein , gauss - bonnet and third - order lovelock theory , respectively . as mentioned above , the line elements for the unperturbed black strings can be obtained by oxidating the black holes given in eq .",

    "the asymptotic behaviors allowed by eq .",
    "( [ todas ] ) are given by in each case correspond to the inverse power of the decay in the gravitational potential of the black hole solution in the transverse section of the black strings .",
    "] @xmath90 in an analogous manner to what we have discussed in the previous section , it can be shown that the  plus \" branch on each case provides a normalizable unstable ( @xmath78 ) physical mode , provided one deals with the perturbation using the kruskal coordinates presented in sec .",
    "ii a. figure 2 shows the unstable modes for a fixed radius simultaneously on the three different lovelock theories that allow homogeneous black strings in @xmath0 .        from the picture",
    "we can see that the minimum critical wavelength that triggers the gregory - laflamme instability @xmath91 grows with the power of the curvature involved on each theory .",
    "therefore , for a fixed radius of the black hole in the transverse section of the string , if we compactify the @xmath92 direction to a scale @xmath93 , no unstable s - wave mode will be allowed . then , if we start increasing @xmath94 , the black strings of general relativity become unstable first .",
    "then the ones in gauss - bonnet theory become unstable for @xmath95 , and finally the black strings of third - order lovelock theory become unstable for @xmath96 .",

    "we have shown that the homogeneous black strings of third - order lovelock theory in @xmath0 are unstable for long wavelength perturbations traveling along the string .",
    "we have also provided a comparative analysis of the instabilities of homogeneous black strings in general relativity , gauss - bonnet and third - order lovelock theory . by performing such comparison",
    "we have also proved that gauss - bonnet black strings in @xmath0 are unstable , extending our previous result obtained in @xmath97 in @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to explore , in an approximate or numerical solution for an arbitrary linear combination of the three terms , how the dynamics of the perturbations of black strings are affected at different scales .",
    "these scales will be defined by the dimensionful coupling constants @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "this would be important as well on the nonlinear evolution of the perturbations , since , as shown in @xcite in gr in @xmath101 , the nonlinear evolution of a perturbation on a black string leads to a self - similar structure of black holes connected by thinner black strings , which ends on the formation of a null naked singularity .",
    "it is expected that higher curvature terms might play a role before the formation of such a singularity , which must occur before any effect of the backreaction of hawking radiation plays some role .    *",
