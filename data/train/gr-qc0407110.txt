    "one of the primary goals of numerical relativity today is to solve for astrophysical spacetimes that are expected to be strong sources of gravitational wave emission in the frequency bands relevant to current and planned gravitational wave detectors .",
    "expected sources include the inspiral and merger of compact objects , supernovae , pulsars , and the big bang .",
    "an important tool for extracting physics from detector signals is the technique of matched filtering , which requires an accurate wave form of a model of the expected source . for binary black hole mergers ( in particular )",
    "it is thought that numerical relativity is the only method that will be able to provide such waveforms close to and during the plunge phase of the merger . despite significant progress made over the past decade",
    ", a full solution to this problem still eludes researches .",
    "one reason for the difficulty is the complexity of the field equations .",
    "this translates into significant computer resources being needed to solve the equations , which limits the turn - around time for testing new ideas . however , perhaps the largest obstacle so far has been finding a formalism to write the field equations in that is amenable to long - term , stable numerical evolution",
    ". some of the promising techniques used today include symmetric hyperbolic formalisms @xcite , the bssn formalism ( sometimes referred to as the nok formalism ) @xcite and characteristic evolution ( for black hole / neutron star systems ) @xcite .",
    "several groups are also beginning to examine the possibility of constrained evolution for the 3d binary black hole problem @xcite , and other promising directions make use of tetrad formulations of the field equations @xcite , and solution of the conformal field equations @xcite .    a method of writing the field equations that has proven very useful in analytic studies is arrived at by imposing the _ harmonic coordinate condition _",
    ", where the four spacetime coordinates @xmath0 are chosen to individually satisfy wave equations : @xmath1 .",
    "the einstein equations , when written with this condition imposed , take on a mathematically appealing form where the principal part of each partial differential equation satisfied by a metric component @xmath2 becomes the scalar wave operator @xmath3 .",
    "this allowed for ( among other things ) the first existence and uniqueness proof of solutions to the field equations @xcite . in numerical relativity , a solution scheme based directly upon this formulation of the field equations has recently been suggested by garfinkle @xcite ( see also related work by szilagyi and winicour @xcite , and the so - called z4 system@xcite , which seems to be quite similar to generalized harmonic evolution in many respects ) .",
    "garfinkle considered a generalization of the harmonic coordinate condition of the form @xmath4 , where @xmath5 are now arbitrary source functions , and found that the technique was successful in simulations of the approach to the singularity in certain cosmological spacetimes .",

    "the hope then is that even if this system suffers from `` constraint violating modes , '' it may be easier to analyze and cure them using ( for instance ) ideas suggested in research of symmetric hyperbolic versions of the field equations @xcite .",

    "we will not discuss the well - posedness of this system of equations here , though this is certainly a topic worth pursuing .",

    "one disadvantage of the harmonic decomposition is that ( to my knowledge ) there is no simple geometric description of the relationship between @xmath5 and the resulting spacetime coordinates . in same cases one can appeal to the adm lapse and shift view of coordinate freedom to motivate a particular choice of @xmath5 . we will discuss these and several other classes of gauge conditions that may be useful for numerical evolution in the following section .",
    "within the generalized harmonic decomposition one can think of the source functions @xmath5 as representing the four coordinate degrees of freedom available in general relativity .",

    "note that gauge source functions were discussed by friedrich@xcite in some detail , though not specifically within the context of supplying additional evolution equations for them .",

    ", the choice of the normal component @xmath49 in an evolution directly affects the rate of change of @xmath42 with respect to time , and therefore @xmath49 controls the time - slicing of the spacetime ; similarly , @xmath51 controls the manner in which the spatial coordinates evolve with time ( another way of stating this is that ( [ hdotn],[hdoth ] ) are generalizations of the hyperbolic equations governing the lapse and shift within harmonic coordinates@xcite ) .",
    "one way in which an adm style gauge condition can be used within the harmonic decomposition is to substitute the corresponding choices of @xmath42 and @xmath50 into ( [ hdotn]-[hdoth ] ) , and use the result as the source functions for the harmonic evolution .",

    "the manner in which the adm driver conditions are implemented suggests a similar way in which such gauge conditions can be used in a harmonic evolution : instead of substituting in the forms for @xmath42 and @xmath50 in ( [ hdotn]-[hdoth ] ) to try to satisfy the conditions exactly , choose source functions to _ drive _ the gauge toward the desired one . to see how this can be done , first rewrite ( [ hdotn]-[hdoth ] ) as evolution equations for the the lapse and shift : _",

    "it many circumstances it may make more sense to implement the above style driver conditions as evolution equations , rather than algebraic conditions .",
    "this could be , for example , if the initial conditions for @xmath5 are not compatible with the desired gauge choice , and so implementing ( [ hdotn_b]-[perph ] ) will result in discontinuous source functions at the initial time .",
