    "the prime objective of constellation - x mission is high resolution x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "it will cover the @xmath2  kev x - ray bandpass by utilizing two types of high throughput telescope systems to simultaneously cover the low ( 0.25 to 10 kev ) and high energy ( 6 to 40 kev ) bands .",
    "the low - energy spectroscopy x - ray telescope ( sxt ) is optimized to maintain a spectral resolving power of at least 300 across the 0.25 to 10 kev band pass ( e/@xmath0e @xmath1 3000 at 6  kev ) and has a minimum telescope angular resolution of @xmath3 hpd .",
    "the diameter of the field of view is @xmath4 below 10  kev . the high energy system ( hxt ) with lower spectral resolving power ( @xmath0e @xmath1 1  kev ) overlaps the sxt and primarily is used to measure the relatively line - less continuum from 10 to 40 kev .",
    "the diameter of the field of view is @xmath5 for the hxt .",
    "the large collecting area is achieved with a design utilizing several mirror modules , each with its own spectrometer / detector system .",
    "the spectral resolving power of the sxt and the effective area of sxt and hxt are shown in figure  1 .",
    "the sxt uses two spectrometer systems that operate simultaneously to achieve the desired energy resolution : 1 ) a 2 ev resolution quantum microcalorimeter array , and 2 ) a set of reflection gratings for energies @xmath6 kev .",
    "the gratings deflect part of the telescope beam away from the calorimeter array in a design similar to xmm except that the direct beam falls on a quantum calorimeter instead of on a ccd .",
    "the two spectrometers are complementary , with the gratings optimal for high resolution spectroscopy at low energies and the calorimeter at high energies .",
    "the gratings also provide coverage in the 0.3 - 0.5 kev band where the calorimeter thermal and light - blocking filters cause a loss of response .",
    "this low - energy capability is particularly important for high - redshift objects , for which line - rich regions will be moved into this low energy band .",
    "-5truein + 1truein    the hxt uses a multilayer coatings on individual mirror shells to provide the first focusing optics system to operate in the 6 - 40 kev band .",
    "compared to other non - focusing methods such as those used for rxte , constellation - x has twice the area , 640 times the energy resolution , 240 times the spatial resolution , and above 10 kev , 100 times the sensitivity .",
    "axaf and xmm , designated as the workhorses of x - ray astronomy in the next decade , will detect photons with energies up to   10 kev .",
    "the technology development program is now underway and is targeting a first launch in 2007 - 2008 , around the time that axaf will be reaching the end of its projected lifetime",
    ". an essential feature of the constellation - x concept involves minimizing cost and risk by building several identical , modest satellites to achieve a large area .",
    "the current baseline is 6 satellites , although other multiple satellite configurations are also under consideration , with the final choice to be made based on a balance of overall cost and risk .",
    "the mission will be placed into a high earth or l2 orbit to facilitate high observing efficiency , provide an environment optimal for cryogenic cooling , and simplify the spacecraft design .",
    "constellation - x is a key element in nasa s structure and evolution of the universe ( seu ) theme aimed at understanding the extremes of gravity and the evolution of the universe .",
    "we highlight here a few key science areas .    *",
    "how can we use observations of black holes to test general relativity ? *",
    "x - ray observations directly probe physical conditions close to the central engine of blackholes where the distortions of time and space predicted by general relativity are most pronounced . constellation - x will use the spectral features of these objects ( e.g. the broad iron k@xmath7 line discovered by asca @xcite ) to map out the geometry of the inner emission regions and determine the extent to which we can test general relativity .    * what is the total energy output of the universe",
    "? * models of cosmic x - ray background predict that the emission at hard x - rays is due to many absorbed agn @xcite , with their central engines primarily visible via hard x - rays ( and perhaps infrared ) .",
    "if most of the accretion in the universe is highly obscured , then the emitted power per galaxy based on currently available optical , uv , or soft x - ray quasar luminosity functions may be substantially underestimated . by using hard x - ray spectra to advance our knowledge of the total luminosity of agn , constellation - x will bring us closer to knowing the total energy output of the universe .",
    "* what roles do supermassive black holes play in galaxy evolution ?",
    "* constellation - x measurements of black hole mass and spin for the high z quasar sample will allow understanding of the relative evolution rates of black holes and their host galaxies , and will shed light on when massive black holes formed compared to the galaxy formation epoch .    * how does gas flow in accretion disks and how do cosmic jets form ?",
    "* accretion disks play a fundamental role in many astrophysical settings , ranging from the formation of planetary systems to accretion onto supermassive black holes in agn .",
    "there are , however , many controversies about the nature of viscosity which drives the accretion process , about the stability of the disk at various accretion rates , and about the relevance of advection and mass outflows , and the mechanisms by which jets are formed .",
    "constellation - x will probe the physics of accretion disks to a level not currently possible , by resolving line features from the accretion disk photosphere and by measuring the continuum shape over a broad energy band .",
    "* when were clusters of galaxies formed and how do they evolve ?",
    "* to date , cluster abundances have been measured in the x - ray band out to a redshift of about 0.4 but no discernible evolution with z has been seen .",
    "constellation - x spectra of clusters over a range of redshifts will provide crucial information about the presence of primordial gas , including any input from possible pre - galactic generations of stars as well as the contribution from stellar nucleosynthesis as a function of time .",
    "the high sensitivity of constellation - x is essential for extending such studies to the `` poorer cousins '' of clusters , groups of galaxies .",
    "moreover , by mapping the velocity distribution of hot cluster gas via doppler shifts in the emission lines , constellation - x will allow us to examine the effects of collisions and mergers between member galaxies and between separate subclusters and clusters .",
    "* where are the `` missing baryons '' in the local universe ?",
    "* recent observations of the lyman-@xmath7 forest show that at large redshifts most of the predicted baryon content of the universe is in the igm , while at low redshifts , the baryon content of stars , neutral hydrogen , and x - ray emitting cluster gas is roughly one order of magnitude smaller than that expected from nucleosynthesis arguments .",
    "therefore , a large fraction of baryonic content of the local universe is considered `` missing '' . numerical simulations @xcite predict that the missing matter may reside in the igm with a temperature range of @xmath8  k. such gas in the igm can be detected with the high sensitivity , high resolution instruments aboard constellation - x through the absorption lines of metals against the x - ray spectra of background quasars ( e.g. ovii and oviii ) .    * how are matter and energy exchanged between stars and the interstellar medium and how is the intergalactic medium enriched ? * the chemical enrichment of the universe is dominated by star formation and the release of the processed material into the ism via stellar winds and supernova explosions .",
    "moreover , supernova explosions and enhanced star forming activities can drive hot gas out of the galaxy and enrich the icm / igm on megaparsec scales .",
    "detailed , spatially - resolved x - ray spectra reveal the stellar / supernova abundances , the composition of the surrounding ism , and the interaction of the expanding blast wave with the surrounding material .",
    "high throughput instruments such as those aboard constellation - x are needed to measure the k - lines of less abundant elements such as f , na , al , p , cl , k , sc , ti , v , cr , mn , co , ni , cu , and zn . the increased sensitivity of constellation - x will allow us to extend these studies to exernal galaxies , beyond the magellanic clouds to m1 and m33 , for example .",
    "this will allow us to further our understanding of the history of star formation and exchange of matter between the ism and stars ."
