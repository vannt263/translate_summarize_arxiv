    "despite that transport properties of disordered insulator - conductor composites have been studied for more than thirty years , some phenomena still remain incompletely understood .",
    "one such phenomenon is certainly the origin of nonuniversality of the dc transport near the conductor - insulator critical transition . according to the standard theory of transport in isotropic percolating materials , the bulk conductivity @xmath7 of a composite with volume concentration @xmath8 of the conducting phase behaves as a power - law of the form:@xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a proportionality constant",
    ", @xmath11 is the critical concentration below which the composite has zero conductivity ( or more precisely the conductivity of the insulating phase ) and @xmath0 is the dc transport critical exponent .",
    "the above expression holds true in the critical region @xmath12 in which critical fluctuations extend over distances much larger than the characteristic size of the constituents . as a consequence , contrary to @xmath10 and @xmath11 which depend on microscopic details such as the microstructure and the mean inter - grain junction conductance ,",
    "the exponent @xmath0 is expected to be material independent.@xcite the universality of @xmath0 is indeed confirmed by various numerical calculations of random - resistor network models which have established that @xmath13 for three dimensional lattices to a rather high accuracy.@xcite     and corresponding critical threshold concentration @xmath11 for various disordered conductor - insulator composites .",
    "carbon - black  polymer systems are from refs.[- ] , oxide - based thick film resistors are from refs.[- ] , metal - inorganic and -organic insulator granular metals are from refs.[- ] .",
    "the dashed line denotes the universal value @xmath14 . ]",
    "confirmations to the standard percolation theory of transport universality are found only in a limited number of experiments on real disordered composites .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] where we have collected 99 different values of the critical exponent @xmath0 and the critical threshold @xmath11 measured in various composites including carbon - black ",
    "polymer systems,@xcite@xmath15@xcite oxide - based thick film resistors ( tfrs),@xcite@xmath15@xcite and other metal - inorganic and -organic insulator composites.@xcite@xmath15@xcite it is clear that , despite that many of the @xmath0-values reported in fig.[fig1 ] are close to @xmath14 , almost @xmath16 of the measured critical exponents deviate from universality by displaying @xmath17 .    examining all the data reported in fig.[fig1 ]",
    ", one observes that the lack of universality is not limited to a particular class of materials , although the granular metals ( empty diamonds in fig.[fig1 ] ) have somewhat less spread values of @xmath0 compared to the carbon - black and tfrs composites .",
    "another important observation is that for the vast majority of the cases , the nonuniversal critical exponent is _ larger _ than @xmath18 , and only few data display @xmath19 .",
    "finally , there is no clear correlation between @xmath0 and the critical concentration value @xmath11 .    with the accumulation of experimental reports of nonuniversality ,",
    "various theories have been proposed in order to find an origin to this phenomenon.@xcite in ref .",
    "it was argued that , in carbon - black  polymer composites , long - range interactions could drive the system towards the mean - field regime for which @xmath20 .",
    "this interpretation can not however explain the observation of critical exponents much larger than @xmath21 , such as those of carbon - based composites or tfrs which display values of @xmath0 as high as @xmath22 .",
    "the authors of ref . introduced the random - void ( rv ) model of continuum percolation where current flows through a conducting medium embedding insulating spheres placed at random . by using an earlier result,@xcite they were able to show that for this model dc transport is described by an universality class different from that of standard percolation model on a lattice .",
    "the resulting critical exponent was found to be @xmath23 for three dimensional systems .",
    "more recently , balberg generalized the rv model in an attempt to explain higher @xmath0-values.@xcite the same author proposed also a model of transport nonuniversality based on an inverted rv model in which current flows through tunneling processes between conducting spheres immersed in an insulating medium.@xcite within this picture , if the distribution function of the tunneling distances decays much slower than the tunneling decay , then the critical exponent becomes dependent of the mean tunneling distance @xmath2 and in principle has no upper bound .",
    "in addition to the above models , there were also explications pointing out that when eq.([rho ] ) is used to fit experimental data not restricted to the critical region , `` apparent critical exponents '' , usually larger than @xmath18 , could be misinterpreted as real critical exponents.@xcite although this possibility can not be excluded for some of the data reported in fig.[fig1 ] , it is however quite unrealistic to identify the whole set of reported nonuniversal exponents as merely apparent .    the mean - field interpretation,@xcite the rv model and its generalization,@xcite and the tunneling inverted rv model ( also known as the tunneling - percolation model),@xcite have been devised to describe nonuniversality for various classes of materials . for example",
    ", the rv model applies in principle to composites where the linear size of the conducting particles is much smaller than that of the insulating grains so that the conducting phase can be approximated by a continuum .",
    "the tunneling - percolation model has been instead conceived to apply to those composites for which inter - grain tunneling is the main microscopic mechanism of transport , such as in carbon - black ",
    "polymer composites,@xcite or in oxide - based trfs.@xcite in principle , the two models could even coexist together if the continuum phase of a rv system is made of non - sintered conducting particles interacting through tunneling processes .",
    "in this situation , the different proposed theories could account for the variety of nonuniversal exponents shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "however , it is also true that , in order to identify a given mechanism of nonuniversality for specific composites , little has been done beyond a mere fit to eq.([rho ] ) .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "the dc critical exponents have been examined together with the relative resistance noise exponent , and in ref . a study on ac and magnetoresistive exponents for various composites has been presented . as a matter of fact",
    ", no conclusive answers have been reached and the different models of nonuniversality listed above have not proven to really apply to real composites .    in this paper",
    "we present our contribution to the understanding of the origin of transport nonuniversality by attacking the problem from a different point of view .",
    "in contrast with the mean - field hypothesis,@xcite the rv model,@xcite and its extension,@xcite the tunneling - percolation model of balberg predicts that the critical exponent @xmath0 acquires an explicit dependence upon a microscopic variable ( the mean - tunneling distance @xmath2 ) which could be altered by a suitable external perturbation .",
    "so , if transport nonuniversality is driven by tunneling , it would be possible to change the value of the transport critical exponent @xmath0 by applying a pressure or a strain to the composite .",
    "conversely , when a material belongs to some universality class ( standard percolation theory , mean - field universality class , or the rv model ) its exponent is expected to be independent of microscopic details and an applied strain would not change @xmath0 .",
    "we have applied this idea to ruo@xmath3-based tfrs whose transport properties are known to be governed by inter - grain tunneling processes.@xcite in the following of this paper we show that the behavior of the piezoresistive response , _ i. e. _ the change of resistivity upon applied mechanical strain,@xcite as a function of concentration @xmath8 of ruo@xmath3 , can be interpreted as due to a tunneling distance dependence of the dc critical exponent @xmath0 , as originally proposed in ref .. the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we briefly review the tunneling - percolation theory and the rv model and its extension . in sec.[piezo ] we describe the theory of piezoresistivity for percolating composites and in sec.[expe ] we present our experimental results .",
    "the last section is devoted to a discussion and to the conclusions .",
    "the rv models,@xcite and the tunneling - percolation theory,@xcite have one point in common .",
    "they all rely on the work of kogut and straley who first developed a theoretical model of nonuniversality based on random - resistor networks.@xcite in this model , to each neighboring couple of sites on a regular lattice it is assigned with probability @xmath24 a bond with conductance @xmath25 and bond with @xmath26 with probability @xmath27 .",
    "the resulting bond conductance distribution function is then : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the dirac delta function and @xmath30 is the distribution function of the finite bond conductances .",
    "close to the bond percolation threshold @xmath31 , the conductivity @xmath32 of the network behaves as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a prefactor . in this and in the subsequent section",
    "we distinguish the conductivity @xmath32 of a random - resistor network from that of real composites [ eq.([rho ] ) ] .",
    "when @xmath35 where @xmath36 is some nonzero value , eq.([distri1 ] ) reduces to the standard bi - modal model for which , close to the percolation threshold , the network conductivity @xmath32 follows eq.([sigma0 ] ) with @xmath13 for all three dimensional lattices .",
    "instead , if @xmath30 has a power law divergence for small @xmath37 of the form : @xmath38 where @xmath39 , then universality is lost for sufficiently large values of the exponent @xmath40.@xcite for lattices of dimension @xmath41 , the resulting conductivity critical exponent is:@xcite @xmath42 where @xmath18 is the universal value and @xmath43 is the correlation - length exponent ( @xmath44 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath47 ) . for @xmath47 and by using @xmath14 and @xmath48 the value of @xmath40 beyond which universility is lost is @xmath49 .",
    "only recently eq.([nonuni0 ] ) has been demonstrated to be valid to all orders of a @xmath50 expansion in a renormalization group analysis.@xcite    in the original work of ref .",
    ", @xmath40 was considered as no more than a parameter of the theory without a justification on microscopic basis .",
    "this came later with the rv models and the tunneling - percolation theories.@xcite however , before discussing the microscopic aspect , we find it interesting to point out that eq.([nonuni0 ] ) predicts that @xmath0 can not be lower than @xmath18 and it is in principle not bounded above .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the experimental values of @xmath0 reported in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "furthermore , eq.([nonuni0 ] ) can give us some information on the distribution of @xmath0 values expected by the theory .",
    "in fact , given some normalized distribution function @xmath51 for the parameter @xmath40 and for @xmath47 , the distribution @xmath52 of the @xmath0 values is : @xmath53 = \\delta(t - t_0)\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\alpha_c } \\ !",

    "equation ( [ distri4 ] ) is plotted in fig.([fig2 ] ) together with the distribution of @xmath0 values reported in fig.([fig1 ] ) .",
    "the distribution @xmath52 has been renormalized to the number of @xmath0 values and the constant @xmath54 has been fixed to reproduce the number of data with @xmath59 .",
    "there is an overall qualitative agreement between the distribution of the experimental @xmath0 values and @xmath52 . in particular , the asymmetry of the distribution and its tail for @xmath60 are well reproduced .",
    "fitting to a power law leads to a decay proportional to @xmath61 ( see inset of fig.[fig2 ] ) which is in fair agreement with the predicted behavior @xmath62 . due to the limited number of @xmath0 values available to us , the agreement with eq.([distri4 ] )",
    "could be fortuitous .",
    "however , the point here is that the gradual decrease of the number of times high values of @xmath0 are reported is not necessarily due to `` bad fits '' to eq.([rho]),@xcite but it can be , at least qualitatively , explained by the form of eq.([nonuni0 ] ) .",

    "inset : log - log plot of the distribution with a fit to the power law @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 . ]",
    "let us now discuss the microscopic origin of the exponent @xmath40 . according to the original rv model,@xcite the crucial parameter is the conducting channel width @xmath66 left over from neighboring insulating spheres . for @xmath47 ,",
    "the cross - section of the conducting channel has roughly the shape of a triangle and the resulting channel conductance @xmath37 scales as @xmath67.@xcite hence , if @xmath68 is the distribution function of the channel width @xmath66 , the distribution @xmath30 of the conductances reduces to : @xmath69 where @xmath36 is a proportionality constant . for random distribution of equally sized spheres",
    ", @xmath68 is a constant for @xmath70 and eq.([distri5 ] ) gives @xmath71 for @xmath72.@xcite @xmath30 is therefore of the same form of eq.([distri2 ] ) with @xmath73 which , according to eq.([nonuni0 ] ) , predicts a critical exponent @xmath74 . despite",
    "that this value is only slightly larger than the universal exponent @xmath14 , the rv model has the merit of being a fully microscopic justification of eq.([distri2 ] ) . in order to allow for higher values of @xmath0 , in ref .",
    "it has been proposed to relax the condition that @xmath68 is a constant for @xmath75 by introducing the more general condition @xmath76 where @xmath77 . by using eq.([distri5 ] ) one readily finds that @xmath30 is again given by eq.([distri2 ] ) but with @xmath78.@xcite hence , the critical exponent is @xmath79 for @xmath80 or @xmath81 for @xmath82 , _",
    "i. e. _ , @xmath0 is no bounded above .",
    "the use of @xmath76 has been justified to be a simple ansatz to describe real composites in which correlations between the conducting and insulating phases may yield to deviations from the ideal rv system .",
    "it is important to stress that the rv model of ref . does not give a breakdown of universality , but rather to a universality class different from that of the standard dc transport percolation on a lattice .",
    "in particular , the exponent @xmath83 does not depend on the conductivity of the continuum and an applied isotropic strain or pressure , albeit affecting the channel width @xmath66 , does not change the relation @xmath67 .",
    "this should remain true also for the generalized rv theory of ref ..",
    "contrary to the rv models , the tunneling - percolation theory of nonuniversality allows for a transport critical exponent dependent of the microscopic conductivites.@xcite in this model , current flows through tunneling processes between neighboring conducting spheres dispersed in an insulating medium and , for sufficiently low concentrations of the conducting spheres , the ensemble of tunneling bonds form a percolating network .",
    "the coexistence of tunneling and percolation has been recently settled by experiments probing the local electrical connectivity of various disordered systems , and a recent review on this issue can be found in ref .. in what follows , we consider the situation in which grain charging effects can be neglected with respect to the tunneling processes , as encountered in systems with sufficiently large conducting grains and/or high temperatures .",
    "let us consider then the inter - particle tunneling conductance : @xmath84 where @xmath36 is a constant , @xmath85 is the tunneling factor which is of the order of few nm , @xmath86 is the distance between the centers of two neighboring spheres of diameter @xmath87 ( @xmath88 for impenetrable particles ) . if we denote with @xmath89 the distribution function of adjacent inter - sphere distances @xmath86 , the bond conductances are then distributed according to : @xmath90.\\ ] ] balberg notices that if @xmath89 had a slower decay than eq.([tunnel1 ] ) for @xmath91 , then @xmath30 would develop a divergence for @xmath72 .",
    "for example , by assuming that @xmath92 is a good approximation for the ( normalized ) distribution of inter - particle distances , then eq.([tunnel2 ] ) would reduce to @xmath93 with @xmath94 where @xmath2 is the mean distance between neighboring particles . for @xmath95 ,",
    "transport becomes nonuniversal with @xmath96.@xcite it is important to stress that here nonuniversality is not driven by geometrical factors as in the rv model , but rather by physical parameters such as @xmath85 and @xmath2 .",
    "these can be different depending on the composite and can be modified by a suitable external perturbation .",
    "in fact , in the case of a applied pressure or strain , the mean tunneling distance @xmath2 would change leading to a modification of the critical exponent @xmath0 . as already pointed out in the introduction",
    ", the detection of such an effect would be a direct signature of a tunneling - percolation  like mechanism of transport nonuniversality .",
    "the tunneling - percolation theory in its original formulation relies on eq.([tunnel3 ] ) which should be regarded as a phenomenological model of the distribution function of inter - particle distances .",
    "recently , however , a microscopic derivation of eq.([tunnel3 ] ) has been formulated for a bond - percolation regular network in which the bonds have probability @xmath24 of being occupied by a string of @xmath97 non - overlapping spheres.@xcite in this case , in fact , eq.([tunnel3 ] ) is the exact distribution function for spheres placed in a one - dimensional channel,@xcite and the resulting bond conductance distribution is proportional to @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 is the mean inter - particle distance for a bond occupied by @xmath97 spheres . despite of its over - simplification ,",
    "this construction shows however that the tunneling - percolation mechanism of nonuniversality can be justified by a fully defined model , without need of phenomenological forms of @xmath89 .",
    "the sensitivity of the tunneling - percolation mechanism of nonuniversality to variations of the mean tunneling distance can be exploited by imposing a volume compression or expansion to the system . as we discuss below , under these circumstances the relative change of resistivity , _",
    "i. e. _ the piezoresistive response , changes dramatically depending on whether the dc exponent is universal ( @xmath79 ) or instead it is driven away from universality by the tunneling - percolation mechanism .",
    "let us consider the rather general situation in which a parallelepiped with dimensions @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 is subjected to a deformation along its main axes @xmath8 ,",
    "@xmath104 , and @xmath105 .",
    "the initial volume @xmath106 changes to @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the volume dilatation and @xmath109 are the principal strains along @xmath110 with @xmath111 . in the absence of strain , we assume that the conductivity @xmath32 of the parallelepiped is isotropic , so that the conductance @xmath112 measured along the @xmath113 axis is @xmath114 . for small @xmath115 ( @xmath111 ) , the conductance variation @xmath116 is therefore : @xmath117 where @xmath118 are the relative variation of the conductivity along the @xmath111 directions .",
    "the coefficients @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the longitudinal and transverse piezoresistive factors defined as : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the resistivity along the @xmath113-axis and @xmath123 is the natural logarithm .",
    "the distinction between longitudinal , @xmath119 , and transverse , @xmath120 , piezoresistive responses is important whenever the values of the strains @xmath110 depend on the direction , as it is encountered when the sample is subjected to uniaxial distortions as those induced in cantilever beam experiments ( see next section ) .    in what follows ,",
    "we are mainly interested in the isotropic ( or hydrostatic ) piezoresistive factor @xmath5 defined as the resistivity change induced by the isotropic strain field @xmath124 for all @xmath111 : @xmath125 which can be obtained by applying an hydrostatic pressure to the parallelepiped .",
    "however , @xmath5 can also be obtained by setting @xmath124 in eq.([g2 ] ) yielding : @xmath126 which is a useful relation when the experimental set up does not permit to apply an isotropic strain field .",
    "let us now study how the tunneling - percolation theory of non - universality affect the piezoresistive factor @xmath5 . to this end , we assume that a cubic bond - percolation network is embedded in a homogeneous elastic medium and that the elastic coefficients of the network and the medium are equal . under an isotropic strain field @xmath124 ( @xmath111 ) the mean tunneling distance @xmath2 changes to @xmath127 independently of the bond orientation .",
    "hence , by assuming for simplicity that @xmath128 , the tunneling parameter @xmath94 entering eq.([nonuni0 ] ) becomes @xmath129 for @xmath130 . according to the discussion of sec.[models ] and to eqs.([sigma0],[nonuni0],[g4 ] ) , close to the percolation threshold @xmath31 , the piezoresistive factor behaves therefore as : @xmath131 where @xmath132 where we have used @xmath133 .",
    "the tunneling distance dependence of the dc transport exponent is therefore reflected in a _",
    "logarithmic _ divergence of @xmath5 as @xmath134 . instead , when @xmath135 , the dc exponent remains equal to @xmath18 also when @xmath136 and the resulting piezoresistive factor is simply equal to @xmath137 , independently of the bond probability @xmath24 .",
    "it is worth to note that , as shown in ref .",
    ", contrary to @xmath5 , the breakdown of universality has no effect on the piezoresistive anisotropy defined as @xmath138 which behaves as @xmath139 where the critical exponent @xmath140 is independent of @xmath40 also when @xmath141.@xcite    equation ( [ g6 ] ) is an exact result as long as we are concerned with the @xmath142 dependence close to the percolation threshold .",
    "however , in addition to the prefactor of the logarithm , @xmath5 depends also on the tunneling parameter @xmath40 through the term @xmath143 .",
    "this dependence is far to be trivial .",
    "in fact , consider a tensile strain ( @xmath144 ) which enhances the bond tunneling resistances leading to an overall enhancement of the sample resistivity . in this case , @xmath145 must be strictly positive .",
    "this means that @xmath146 when @xmath147 while , from eq.([g6 ] ) , when @xmath141 @xmath143 does not need to be positive to ensure @xmath148 because of the presence of the logarithmic divergence . in the next subsections we provide evidences that indeed @xmath143 changes sign in passing from @xmath147 to @xmath141 by showing that both the effective medium approximation and numerical calculations on cubic lattices give negative values of @xmath143 for nonuniversal dc transport . together with the logarithmic divergence of @xmath5 for @xmath134 ,",
    "a negative value of @xmath143 would be an additional signature of a tunneling - percolation mechanism of nonuniversality .       of eq.([sigma0 ] ) as a function of the tunneling parameter @xmath40 .",

    "note that @xmath34 and @xmath143 are not plotted for small values of @xmath40 because in this region the logarithmic corrections to @xmath32 calculated within ema change the simple power law behavior of eq.([sigma0 ] ) . ]    in the effective medium approximation ( ema ) the conductivity @xmath151 of a bond percolation cubic lattice ( with bond length @xmath152 ) is obtained by the solution of the following integral equation ( see for example ref . ) : @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the distribution function of the bond conductances @xmath37 given in eq.([distri1 ] ) .",
