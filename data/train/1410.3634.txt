[ figiprcenter ] ) and at @xmath79 ( where we do expect a localization transition ) . to avoid the influence of irrelevant superradiant states with @xmath103 ,",
    "we limit our analysis to eigenvalues with @xmath153 . as can be seen from figs .",

    "further increase of density restores level repulsion signaling that the system leaves the localized regime and returns to the situation in which the eigenstates are extended .",

    "however , when trying to understand these results qualitatively , a number of legitimate questions may arise concerning the microscopic details of physical processes at work and their interplay . in this section , we provide elements of answers to a couple of such questions that we anticipate .",
    "one might argue that given the decoupling of transitions corresponding to different @xmath13 , @xmath14 in a strong magnetic field , the decoupling that is rigorously confirmed by the existence of the effective scalar green s matrix ( 3 ) that describes scattering on each transition separately from the others , light may escape from the medium along some special directions in which it has `` wrong '' polarization and can not be scattered by the transition corresponding to its frequency .",
    "indeed , imagine a photon emitted by an atomic excited state corresponding , say , to @xmath99 .",
    "the photon will be resonant with the same transition of the next atom on its way , but can be scattered by this atoms only if its helicity has a projection on the direction of the dipole moment of the atomic transition .",
    "the latter projection depending on the direction in which the photon propagates , a special direction will exist for which scattering vanishes , and the photon will be able to propagate ballistically until it reaches a boundary of the atomic cloud and escapes to the free space .",
    "such `` escape channels '' induced by the magnetic field would decrease the lifetime of collective states in the atomic cloud and should not favor localized states .",
    "how can this picture be reconciled with our main conclusion about the appearance of localized states in the magnetic field ?    to answer this question , let us consider the problem a little bit more rigorously .",
    "the spontaneous decay of an initially excited atom @xmath8 ( initial state @xmath11 , @xmath61 ) leads to the emission of a photon propagating along a direction determined by angles @xmath66 , @xmath163 of the spherical coordinate system ( see fig .  [ photon ] ) . to describe the polarization properties of radiation we will use the so - called spiral basis although the subsequent discussion can be repeated for the linear basis as well .",

    "the three atomic transitions from excited states @xmath11 , @xmath101 ; @xmath11 , @xmath13 ; @xmath11 , @xmath99 to the ground state @xmath9 are characterized by three different vectors of the transition dipole moment @xmath171 .",

    "[ photon ] ) initially in the ground state @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that the photons are resonant with the transition @xmath177 , @xmath99 and neglect the existence of two other transitions which is justified in a strong magnetic field when the three transitions corresponding to different @xmath61 have very different frequencies .    similarly to the emission probability amplitude",
    ", the absorption probability amplitude for a photon of right ( left ) helicity is determined by the scalar product of the unit vector @xmath174 ( @xmath172 ) and the dipole moment @xmath187 . because @xmath188 , the required scalar product can be calculated using the complex conjugate of eqs .",

    "this yields the absorption probability amplitudes @xmath189 and @xmath190 for photons of right and left helicities , respectively . on the one hand , these absorption amplitudes are smaller than those in the absence of magnetic field , when the photon emitted by the first atom is resonant with all three transitions of the second one .",
    "moreover , for certain combinations of helicity and propagation direction ( e.g. , for the right helicity and @xmath191 or for the left helicity and @xmath192 ) , the absorption amplitude vanishes which corresponds to propagation without scattering and an infinitely large scattering mean free path for photons of these precise helicities in these precise directions .",
    "however , on the other hand , for the particular directions in which the probability amplitude of photon absorption by the atom @xmath178 , @xmath186 , vanishes , the probability amplitude of photon emission by the atom @xmath8 , @xmath193 , vanishes as well .",
    "in other words , there exist indeed certain combinations of helicity and propagation direction in which scattering is absent such that the corresponding photon would leave the atomic medium ballistically .",
    "however , the probability of emission of such a photon by an atomic excited state is zero and these particular combinations of helicity and propagation direction can not serve as decay channels for the excited atomic states .",
    "an extension of the above reasoning to photons emitted not exactly but close to the `` critical '' directions identified above shows that the scattering mean free path of these photons will be large but finite , whereas the probability of their emission will be small . as a result , they do not have any special influence on the quantities studied in the main text of the letter ( although , as we will see below , they are fully taken into account in our analysis ) .",
    "for example , no atomic states with anomalously short lifetimes appear due to these photons as can be verified by comparing eigenvalues of the random green s matrix ( 2 ) with and without the external magnetic field @xmath175 .",
    "moreover , the average lifetime of collective atomic states remains equal to @xmath194 ( which follows from @xmath195 ) independent of @xmath175 .",
    "the arguments presented above can be repeated for the two other transitions with the conclusion remaining exactly the same . for a photon emitted on the transition @xmath11 , @xmath196 , for example",
    ", the angular dependencies of emission and absorption probability amplitudes are given by the same equations as for the photon emitted on the @xmath11 , @xmath176 transition with right and left helicities interchanged .",

    "we believe that the difference in the dependencies of emission / absorption probabilities for different helicities on the propagation direction for @xmath13 , @xmath14 may be at the origin of the peculiar difference observed between the localized states appearing near @xmath58 ( states resonant with the transitions @xmath11 , @xmath199 ) and extended states near @xmath200 ( states resonant with the transitions @xmath11 , @xmath197 ) although more work is required to establish a precise link between the two phenomena .    finally , we would like to note that the analysis presented above allows for calculating the total probability amplitude @xmath201 for an atom to get excited by the photon emitted by another atom ( see fig .  [ photon ] ) . important for us",
    "is the dependence of this amplitude on the angles @xmath66 and @xmath163 that can be obtained by multiplying the probability of emission @xmath202 by the probability of absorption @xmath203 and then summing over the two helicities .",
    "we obtain @xmath204 these results coincide with those that can be obtained from the green s matrix ( 2 ) .",

    "( [ exp1 ] ) and ( [ exp2 ] ) .",
    "the analysis presented in section [ evidence ] clearly shows that the localization transition discovered in the main text exhibits a number of features expected for the disorder - driven , anderson localization transition . in particular , the minimum decay rate of quasi - modes decreases exponentially with sample size beyond a certain critical number density of atoms ( section [ decay ] ) and the mutual repulsion of complex eigenvalues is suppressed ( section [ repulsion ] ) .",
    "in addition , the localized states under study can be clearly distinguished from subradiant states localized on pairs of closely located atoms due to very different values of the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath104 ( @xmath57 near the resonances @xmath212 for the new discovered localized states but @xmath57 far from resonances for the two - atom subradiant states , see section [ iprmaps ] ) . despite this",
    ", however , it would be premature to claim that the discovered transition is a standard anderson transition because the role of cooperative phenomena and of dipole - dipole interactions between atoms still remains to be clarified .",
    "in section [ remarks ] we have demonstrated that escape channels  special combinations of polarization and propagation direction for which a photon is not scattered by the atoms , do not affect the lifetime of the excited atomic states and are thus compatible with the localization transition discovered in the main text of the letter .",
    "this is due to the relation that exists between the emission and absorption diagrams of two - level atoms in the magnetic field .",
    "the latter relation leads to a vanishing emission probability for photons that would have a vanishing absorption probability .",

    "<S> ( [ eff ] ) varies from 0 to 1 for @xmath13 and from @xmath69 to 1 for @xmath48 as a function of @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus closer to its scalar - wave value of 1 in the former case , suggesting that the case of @xmath48 may be better approximated by the scalar model than the case of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> second , the near - field term [ the third line of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eff ] ) ] is a factor of two smaller for @xmath48 than for @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> because near - field terms responsible for resonant dipole - dipole interactions between nearby atoms suppress light scattering @xcite and prevent anderson localization @xcite , their weakness for @xmath48 is an advantage . </S>",
    "<S> we see therefore that both far- and near - field features of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eff ] ) are closer to its scalar approximation for @xmath48 than for @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> this explains the appearance of localized states for @xmath48 rather than for @xmath13 transitions .    to have a quantitative characterization of the localization transition demonstrated in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> , @xmath73 reaches small values @xmath74 expected for localized states only at large densities corresponding to @xmath75 and only for @xmath57 corresponding to @xmath48 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3d ] ) , in agreement with fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ipr ] . the independence of @xmath73 from the sample size at the points where curves corresponding to the same value of @xmath57 but different @xmath33 cross  a hallmark of critical behavior  is further illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : g ] where we reproduce @xmath76 for @xmath57 slightly shifted to the left of the single - atom resonances @xmath45 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : g ] . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath78 changes sign for @xmath79 and 1998 but not for @xmath80 proving that the localization transition takes place at large frequency shifts @xmath81 but not around the fundamental resonance @xmath43 .            </S>",
    "<S> the localization transition reported here takes place under conditions when not only the disorder - induced multiple scattering of photons is strong but cooperative effects leading to dicke super- and sub - radiance @xcite and resonant dipole - dipole interactions between neighboring atoms @xcite are important as well . therefore , despite its overall similarity with the anderson transition ( see also ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , it remains to be seen if this transition can be classified as such . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , for light of a given frequency @xmath82 the localized regime @xmath83 is realized only in the intermediate range of @xmath84 ( e.g. , @xmath85@xmath86 for @xmath79 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : g ] ) which corresponds to large sizes of the atomic cloud @xmath87 ( e.g. , @xmath88@xmath89 at @xmath90 ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the localized states disappear in the dicke limit @xmath91 when the cooperative effects dominate . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the latter are not the main driving force behind the reported localization transition .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have found that the magnetic field can induce a transition from extended to localized states for light in an ensemble of identical immobile two - level atoms . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the removal of degeneracy of the excited atomic state by the field and the resulting partial suppression of resonant dipole - dipole interactions between nearby atoms . </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical predictions can be directly verified in experiments with , e.g. , sr atoms that have a nondegenerate ground state and were already used to study multiple scattering of light @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical analysis of light scattering in dense clouds of alkali atoms ( such as , e.g. , rb@xmath92 ) is , however , much more involved @xcite and our results can not be trivially extended to this case .    </S>",
