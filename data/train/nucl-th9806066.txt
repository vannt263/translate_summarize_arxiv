    "the experimental search for the quark - gluon plasma in ultra - relativistic nuclear collisions requires the development of reliable and predictive models of the formation of the plasma and of its hadronization in order to be able to extract observables which signal the existence of a parton plasma in the high energy density region of the colliding nuclei . while lattice calculations have yielded important information on the equilibrium properties of a parton plasma ( at least for baryon chemical potential @xmath0 ) , they are unable yet to describe the space - time development of the plasma formation and its subsequent decay into hadrons .",
    "the formation phase of the plasma is calculated usually in cascade models @xcite , which predict high values for the energy densities in the center of the collision .",
    "these values should be sufficient , according to lattice qcd calculations , for a plasma of deconfined quarks and gluons to be formed .",

    "we have studied the instabilities of a plasma of partons .",
    "the plasma is treated in a quasi - particle model with an effective mass @xmath1 , which depends on @xmath8 and @xmath38 in the equilibrium situation and on @xmath132 , @xmath41 for the expansion . the gap equation which relates the mass to the scalar density of the partons defines the underlying dynamics .",
    "we have studied two cases in parallel : ( i ) a gap equation derived from the njl - lagrangian in the mean field approximation and ( ii ) a phenomenological gap equation which is chosen so that certain observables calculated from the lattice are reproduced by the quasi - particle model . while both models show a crossover transition for @xmath0 and a first order phase transition for @xmath7 , only the phenomenological model has properties of confinement , in that the parton mass becomes very large for vanishing density .",
    "the study of these two , in some sense , complementary models , permits to get an idea on the model dependence of the results .",
    "the stability analysis has been performed on four levels :    * for thermal equilibrium , one calculates the regions in the @xmath183 plane , in which the system is stable , metastable and unstable .",
    "these regions are calculated starting from the pressure as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath9 . at thermal equilibrium instabilities",
    "are expected only at and due to the first order phase transitions . since both models , the njl and the phenomenological one show a first order phase transition for certain values of @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    ", the phase diagrams look rather similar from a qualitative point of view , but the values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 at the phase boundaries are rather different . *",
    "another interesting result found from the analysis of the phase diagram of the phenomenological parton model is the presence of the first order phase transition at finite baryon densities .",
    "although we have followed the lattice qcd data at zero baryon density which show only a crossover transition arround @xmath4 the generalization to finite baryon density using a gap equation depending only on the scalar density leads to a first order phase transition .",
    "this simple model shows that the occurence of a first order phase transition in the highly excited matter with finite baryon density created in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions can not be excluded from the lattice qcd data at zero baryon density .",
    "* the growth rates for the instabilities found in the thermodynamic analysis can be calculated from the vlasov equation in a linear response analysis around thermal equilibrium .",
    "the neglect of the collisions in the linear response analysis in this work is justified when the instability growth rate is larger than the equilibration rate .",
    "we prove that for any quasi - particle model for which @xmath93 , one has a stable system for @xmath56 .",
    "in general the dispersion relation for frequency @xmath78 and wave vector @xmath74 of the instability has no scale and gives @xmath184 , since the gap equation corresponds to a zero range interaction . in the region of the mixed phase obtained from equilibrium thermodynamics ,",
    "one finds solutions with im@xmath185 , _ i.e. _ , perturbations which grow exponentially in time . for the typical scale corresponding to the wave vectors @xmath186  @xmath85 and as long as one is not too far away from the phase boundary the value of the growth rate im@xmath187  ( @xmath92)@xmath188 is surprisingly small ( compared to the expansion time scale of the plasma ) . * the stability behavior",
    "far from equilibrium has been studied by investigating the hubble- and bjorken - solutions , ( _ i.e. _ , three- and one - dimensional expansion , respectively ) of the vlasov equation again by the method of linear response .",
    "the condition for the validity of this procedure is that the growth rate of the instability is faster than the expansion time ( which itself must be larger than the relaxation time in order to be able to use the collisionless vlasov equation ) .",
    "no instabilities are found for the njl - model , while the phenomenological model quickly ( @xmath189 ) develops instabilities with significant growth rates ( im@xmath190 to 1.0  ( @xmath191 for @xmath89  @xmath85 ) even for @xmath56 .",
    "we call these instabilities dynamical ones , since they are obviously not related to the first order phase transition but rather to the confinement properties of the phenomenological quasi - particle model . *",
    "the analysis of the instabilities based on linear response , be it at thermal equilibrium or for an expansion far from equilibrium , is limited to small times , if one finds exponential growth .",
    "the behavior over large times can only be studied numerically .",
    "we have attempted a first step in this direction , in that we have followed the expansion of a plasma described by the phenomenological quasi - particle model in a molecular dynamical calculation .",
    "we find indeed that the expansion of the system eventually leads to clusters with at least two partons .",
    "this is as far as one can get in a classical model which does not know color degrees of freedom .",
    "more work in this direction is intended .",
