    "the production of massive vector gauge boson in relativistic hadron - hadron collisions has been extensively studied at @xmath4 colliders like the lhc and the tevatron and is well understood by the standard model ( sm ) in terms of perturbative quantum cromodynamics ( pqcd )  @xcite . for this reason",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 production is commonly considered as a fundamental candle for sm physics at the lhc , considering the relatively large yields due to the high center - of - mass energy and luminosity available , as well as the clean experimental signatures .",
    "the @xmath5 data from @xmath4 collisions at the tevatron and the lhc also provide valuable information about the parton density functions ( pdf ) of the nucleon in global qcd fits  @xcite .",
    "the recent precision data from the cms  @xcite and atlas  @xcite experiments offer the possibility to extend the study of @xmath1 and @xmath2 boson production to proton - lead collisions with @xmath0tev per two coliding nucleons at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "since the qcd factorization theorem  @xcite is expected to hold for nuclei , we can still describe this process in terms of pqcd , with the corresponding nuclear pdfs for the lead nucleus . to this end , we recall that pdfs are universal characteristics of the target at high momentum transfer @xmath6 , which are driven by non - perturbative strong interactions in the considered target .",
    "the leptonic decays of @xmath5 bosons produced through the drell - yan mechanism ( dy ) are of particular interest in this context since they are not modified by the hot and dense medium created in the heavy ion collisions and the decay leptons pass through medium without being affected by the strong interaction .",
    "furthermore , the intrinsic asymmetry in the p+pb collision system allows to probe different pb fragmentation regions and nuclear parton kinematics by selecting different rapidity values , _",
    "e.g. _ , with observables like the forward - backward asymmetries .",
    "the above considerations make the @xmath5 bosons production in p+pb collisions a very good tool to study nuclear modifications of pdfs and to test the validity of the qcd factorization for nuclei .",
    "it is worth noting that the lhc data provide a unique opportunity to access the high @xmath7 phase space region , never explored before by fixed target dis , nor by other experiments .",
    "a few phenomenological parameterizations of nuclear parton distributions ( npdf ) are available in literature @xcite .",
    "typically such analyses assume separate nuclear corrections for each parton distribution , which are extracted from global fits to nuclear data including deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) , dy production , heavy - ion collisions , etc .",
    "although these studies are useful in constraining nuclear effects for different partons , they provide little information about the underlying physics responsible for the nuclear corrections",
    ". furthermore , they result in a large number of free parameters , as well as in nuclear correction factors incorporating explicit parameterizations of the nuclear dependence .",
    "a different approach to nuclear pdfs was introduced in refs .",
    "nuclear modifications for pdfs are computed on the basis of an underlying microscopic model incorporating several nuclear physics mechanisms including the smearing with the energy - momentum distribution of bound nucleons ( fermi motion and binding ) , the off - shell correction to bound nucleon pdfs , the contributions from meson exchange currents and the coherent propagation of the hadronic component of the virtual intermediate boson in the nuclear environment .",
    "this model explains to a high accuracy the observed @xmath8 , @xmath6 and nuclear dependencies of measured nuclear effects in dis on a wide range of targets from deuterium to lead  @xcite , as well as the magnitude , the @xmath8 and mass dependence of all the available data from drell - yan production off various nuclear targets  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we perform a detailed study of the ( pseudo-)rapidity distributions of various observables for @xmath1 and @xmath2 productions in p+pb collisions at the lhc with the kp nuclear pdfs  @xcite .",
    "we compare our predictions with recent cms and atlas data at @xmath0tev and discuss the impact of individual nuclear effects on the observed distributions . to this end",
    ", the kp model allows an interpretation of the experimental results in terms of the underlying nuclear physics mechanisms .",
    "we also address the flavor dependence of the nuclear modifications of pdfs in the context of both @xmath9 and @xmath10 distributions .",
    "this topic is of particular interest since the cms experiment reported possible hints of such a flavor dependence from the @xmath3 charge asymmetry measured in p+pb collisions  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : wzdy ] we outline the description of massive vector boson production in the drell - yan process in proton - proton collisions .",
    "section  [ sec : npdf ] summarizes the main features of the microscopic model used to calculate the kp nuclear pdfs . in sec.[wzinppb ] we apply this model to study massive vector boson production in p+pb collisions at the lhc and the results are presented in sec.[sec : res ] together with detailed comparisons with the recent data from the cms and atlas experiments at @xmath0  tev at the lhc . in sec .",

    "the production of massive vector bosons ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 , denoted as @xmath11 ) through the dy mechanism in high - energy hadronic collisions is a well understood process within the framework of the perturbative qcd  @xcite .",
    "the qcd factorization theorem  @xcite allows to express the corresponding production cross section as the convolution of the pdf in the colliding hadrons with the partonic hard - scattering cross section @xmath12 , which can be calculated order - by - order in pqcd : @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the pdf of flavor @xmath15 in the hadron @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are hadronic and partonic cross sections , respectively . here",
    "the sum is taken over all possible parton flavors . with the presence of a high - invariant - mass colorless lepton pair @xmath19 in final state",
    ", massive vector boson production provides a clean experimental signature to investigate the pdfs of the hadrons involved in the process .    the partonic cross section @xmath18 can be calculated within pqcd order - by - order at the scale @xmath6 . at the leading order ( lo ) in the @xmath20 expansion , this cross - section",
    "is entirely determined by the quark - antiquark annihilation process ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) . at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) ,",
    "additional contributions to the partonic cross - section may arise from three different kinds of processes : i ) one - loop virtual gluon corrections ; ii ) gluon emission corrections @xmath23 ; and iii ) the corrections from quark - gluon scattering @xmath24 or @xmath25  @xcite .    in this work , we study the ( pseudo-)rapidity distributions of the massive vector bosons produced in @xmath26 and @xmath27 collisions at the lhc .",
    "the nlo and next - to - next - to - leading ( nnlo ) coefficients for the partonic cross - sections of the dy process and the hadronic @xmath3 and @xmath28 boson production are well known  @xcite .",
    "we note that the nnlo corrections to the boson - rapidity distributions in relativistic heavy ion collisions have been shown to be rather small at the lhc kinematics  @xcite . in this paper",
    "our focus is on the @xmath1 and @xmath28 production in @xmath29 collisions .",
    "our numerical analysis is carried out mostly to the nlo approximation in pqcd with the help of the dynnlo program  @xcite , which is widely used to study the vector boson production at the lhc , as well as at the tevatron . as an essential input of our calculations ,",
    "we use two different proton pdf sets : abmp15  @xcite and ct10  ( 2012 version )  @xcite .",
    "the renormalization and the factorization scales are both set at the mass of vector boson .",

    "the microscopic model of nuclear pdf of ref.@xcite involves a number of different contributions which can be summarized as follows @xmath31 where on the left side @xmath14 is the pdf of flavor @xmath15 in a nucleus @xmath16 ( for brevity we have suppressed the explicit dependencies on @xmath8 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "the first two terms on the right side stand for the contribution from the bound protons and neutrons , and the brakets denote the averaging with the nuclear spectral function .",
    "the terms @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the corrections arising from nuclear meson exchange currents ( mec ) and coherent interactions of the intermediate virtual boson with the nuclear target , respectively .",
    "the first two terms in eq.([npdf ] ) dominate in the valence region @xmath34 and in the nucleus rest frame can be written as a convolution with the proton and neutron spectral function  @xcite .",
    "for example , for the proton contribution we have : @xmath35 where the integration is over the energy @xmath36 and the momentum @xmath37 of the bound ( off - shell ) nucleon , @xmath38 is the spectral function describing the distribution over energy and momentum of bound protons in the target nucleus , and @xmath39 is the pdf of the bound proton with four - momentum @xmath40 with @xmath41 being the proton mass .",
    "the bjorken variable of the nucleus is @xmath8 and that of the bound proton with four momentum @xmath42 is @xmath43 $ ] ( the @xmath44 axis in eq.([eq : ia ] ) is antiparallel to the direction of the momentum transfer @xmath45 ) . a similar expression can be written for the bound neutron term in eq.([npdf ] ) . for brevity",
    ", we dropped @xmath46 terms in eq.([eq : ia ] ) ( for the full expression see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "note that eq.([eq : ia ] ) was obtained starting from a lorentz - covariant approach and using a systematic expansion of matrix elements in the small parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 and is accurate including the terms of the order @xmath49 and @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the integrand in eq.([eq : ia ] ) factorizes into two terms involving the contribution from two different scales : i ) the nuclear distribution @xmath50 describing the processes at the nucleon level in the nuclear ground state , and ii ) the pdf @xmath39 or @xmath51 describing the processes at the parton level in the nucleon .",
    "the proton ( neutron ) spectral function in eq.([eq : ia ] ) is normalized to the proton ( neutron ) number in the nucleus .",
    "this normalization condition also ensures the proper normalization of the nuclear valence pdf by eq.([eq : ia ] ) . in applications we use a model spectral function , which includes both a mean field contribution dominant at low energy and momentum , and a high - momentum contribution related to short range nucleon - nucleon correlations  @xcite .",
    "note also that while eq.([eq : ia ] ) is written for the nucleus rest frame , the pdf is a lorentz - invariant function and for this reason the result can be used in any reference frame .",
    "the pdf of an off - shell nucleon in eq.([eq : ia ] ) explicitly depends on the nucleon invariant mass squared @xmath52 . since characteristic momenta of a bound nucleon",
    "are small compared its mass , the relevant region of integration in eq.([eq : ia ] ) covers a region in the vicinity of the mass shell and the nucleon virtuality @xmath53 is a small parameter .",
    "then we can expand the pdf in series in @xmath54 keeping only the leading term  @xcite : @xmath55 , \\\\ \\label{delf } \\delta f(x , q^2 ) & = \\partial\\ln q_{a / p}(x , q^2,p^2)/\\partial\\ln p^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 in the right side of eq.([sf : os ] ) is the pdf of the on - mass - shell proton ( or neutron ) and the derivative is evaluated on the mass shell @xmath56 .",
    "the off - shell ( os ) function @xmath57 can be regarded as a special nucleon structure function , which describes the relative modification of nucleon pdf in the vicinity of the mass shell .",
    "this function does not contribute to the cross sections of the on - mass - shell nucleon , but it is relevant only for the bound nucleon and describes its response to the interaction in a nucleus . in general , the function @xmath57 may depend on the pdf type and may be different for the proton and the neutron .",
    "however , a detailed analysis of data on the ratios of dis structure functions of different nuclei @xcite and the nuclear ratios of dy cross sections @xcite supports the hypothesis of a universal os function for all nucleon pdfs , with no significant @xmath6 dependence , _ i.e. _ @xmath58 .",
    "the results of ref.@xcite on @xmath57 are also supported by a recent combined analysis @xcite of dis data off proton and deuteron targets , drell - yan production in @xmath59 and @xmath60 interactions , @xmath1 and @xmath28 boson production in @xmath59 and @xmath61 collisions .",
    "therefore , we use a single universal off - shell function @xmath62 in the calculation of npdfs .",
    "the mesonic fields mediate the nucleon - nucleon interaction at distances exceeding the typical nucleon size and also contribute to the quark - gluon content of the nucleus . the nuclear correction to pdf in eq.([npdf ] ) originating from dis off the virtual mesons exchanged between bound nucleons can be written in terms of the convolution  @xcite : @xmath63 where the sum is taken over the possible meson states , @xmath64 is the light - cone distribution of the meson @xmath65 in the nucleus @xmath16 , and @xmath66 is the parton distribution of flavor @xmath15 in the virtual meson @xmath65 .",
    "the meson light - cone distribution @xmath64 is calculated in refs.@xcite by using the nuclear light - cone momentum balance equation between bound nucleons and meson fields , as well as the equation of motion for the meson fields .",
    "we use the pion parton distribution functions from ref .",
    "@xcite to model the virtual meson pdf @xmath66 in eq.([eq : mec ] ) .",
    "the mec correction results in some enhancement of the nuclear sea - quark distribution and its contribution is relevant in the region @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the nuclear fermi momentum .",
    "the last term in eq.([npdf ] ) is due to the propagation effects of the intermediate hadronic states of a virtual boson in the nuclear environment . in calculating this term",
    "we replace the sum over the set of all intermediate hadronic states by a single effective state and describe its interaction with the nucleon with an effective scattering amplitude .",
    "in the study of ref.@xcite we discuss coherent effects on pdf combinations with definite @xmath69-parity @xmath70 and , for light quarks , with definite isospin @xmath71 ( isoscalar ) and @xmath72 ( isovector ) .",
    "for example , for the isovector and the @xmath69-even pdf combination we have : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the c - even isoscalar forward effective scattering amplitude off the nucleon and @xmath75 is the sum of the nuclear multiple - scattering series for the effective nuclear amplitude in the corresponding channel .",
    "the expressions for the remaining pdf combinations can be found in ref.@xcite and are not given here for brevity .",
    "the term @xmath33 is relevant at low @xmath8 and its strength is governed by the effective amplitudes @xmath76 with different @xmath69-parity and isospin @xmath77 . at small @xmath8",
    "this correction is negative , giving rise to the nuclear shadowing ( ns ) effect , while in the transition region @xmath78 the correction may be positive for some @xmath77 and @xmath69 channels , because of a constructive interference between the amplitudes @xmath76 from different channels @xcite .",
    "we note that different nuclear effects in different kinematical regions of @xmath8 are related by the dis sum rules and normalization constraints .",
    "the model of ref.@xcite utilizes these conditions as dynamical constraints .",
    "for example , as discussed above , the nuclear light - cone momentum sum rule at the hadronic level ( nucleons and mesons ) links the nucleon and meson distribution functions .",
    "the same sum rule at the partonic level constrains nuclear effects in the gluon distribution .",
    "the normalizations of the isoscalar and the isovector valence quark distributions ( the baryon number and the adler sum rules , respectively ) link the coherent and the off - shell corrections , since the other contributions cancel out explicitly  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the off - shell effect provides an explicit mechanism to cancel a negative nuclear - shadowing contribution to the normalization of the nuclear valence quarks .",
    "we also use the dis sum rules to obtain the amplitudes @xmath76 in terms of the off - shell function @xmath57 and the bound nucleon virtuality @xmath54 averaged with the nuclear spectral function @xmath50 in the corresponding isospin state @xmath77 .",
    "a thorough analysis of data on the ratios of dis structure functions off different nuclei was carried out in ref.@xcite in the context of the described model .",
    "the os function @xmath79 , introduced in eq.([sf : os ] ) , was determined phenomenologically from this analysis with an approach similar to the one used for the proton pdfs .",

    ". however , the magnitude of this correction is not universal and differs for the valence and sea quark distribution  @xcite .",
    "we note that the result of the convolution of the nucleon pdf with the nuclear spectral function in eq.([eq : ia ] ) depends upon the shape of the nucleon pdf considered . in the small @xmath8 region",
    "this correction is positive for the valence quarks , thus reducing the effect of the shadowing , but it is negative for the sea quarks .",
    "however , the mec correction for the sea quarks is positive , resulting in a partial cancellation between different effects . in the intermediate region",
    "@xmath102 ( usually referred as _ antishadowing _ region ) we observe an interplay of different nuclear corrections . for the valence",
    "quarks we obtain a moderate enhancement , while for the sea quark distributions we find an almost exact cancellation between different nuclear corrections . at large @xmath103 nuclear pdfs",

    "for the valence quarks , the interplay between the effects due to the nuclear energy - momentum distribution ( fermi motion and binding  fmb ) and the off - shell correction results in a pronounced _ emc - effect _ at large @xmath8 @xcite .",

    "the most visible difference is a more pronounced shadowing correction at small @xmath8 for @xmath113 in dis .",
    "this effect can be explained with the strong @xmath6 dependence of the effective cross section ( @xmath114 ) describing the nuclear interaction in eq.([eq : coh ] ) , since the results in fig.[fig : npdfs ] are obtained at @xmath90 , while the data in fig.[fig : dispbau ] have @xmath115 or lower .",

    "the analysis of the nuclear modifications on the boson - rapidity distributions in p+pb collisions is relatively simple compared to pb+pb collisions , since the nuclear partons are associated to a single nucleus traveling in a definite direction . assuming the longitudinal axis along the proton beam direction , the relation between the boson rapidity @xmath117 and the momentum fraction @xmath118 carried by a nuclear parton can be written in the lo approximation as @xmath119 from eq.([eq : y - x ] ) one can estimate the typical momentum fraction carried by the nuclear partons as @xmath120 at the central rapidity @xmath121 .",
    "if we neglect the contribution of nuclear gluons from higher order qcd corrections , @xmath122 corresponds to the nuclear momentum fraction carried by ( anti-)quarks , with the exception of the very forward region in which nuclear partons move rather slowly .",
    "the kinematic region around @xmath123 corresponds to the transition between the valence - dominated and the sea - dominated regions . as a result ,",

    "furthermore , bosons produced in the backward rapidity region ( @xmath124 , the direction of the lead beam ) can provide valuable information on the nuclear valence quark distributions , while the nuclear sea quark distributions may play a dominant role in the nuclear modifications observed in the forward rapidity region ( @xmath125 , the direction of the proton beam ) .",
    "experimentally , it is easier to measure the pseudo - rapidity of the charged lepton originated from the @xmath3 decay , @xmath126 , rather than the @xmath3 boson rapidity , due to the additional smearing introduced by the undetected neutrino present in the final state .",
    "the two variables are correlated and provide similar insights on the parton distributions  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the differential cross - sections of massive vector bosons , observables defined as ratios of event rates are of particular interest , like the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath127 and the @xmath3 charge asymmetry @xmath128 : @xmath129 where @xmath117 is replaced with @xmath126 for @xmath3 boson production . these ratios can enhance the sensitivity of various observables to the parton distributions and their nuclear modifications , due to the partial cancellation of uncertainties in theoretical calculations ( _ e.g. _ , scale dependence ) and experimental measurements ( _ e.g. _ , integrated luminosity )  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the @xmath2 forward - backward asymmetry from eq.([fbasy ] ) is sensitive to the ratio of small-@xmath8 ( sea - quark dominated ) to large-@xmath8 ( valence - quark dominated ) npdfs , while the @xmath3 charge asymmetry in eq.([casy ] ) can shed light on the flavor dependence of the nuclear modifications of pdfs ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath130 vs. @xmath131 and @xmath132 vs. @xmath133 )  @xcite .",

    "the cms data clearly favor the presence of nuclear medium effect over the free nucleon calculation , as shown in fig.[fig : wcmseta ] .",
    "the predictions of different models for the @xmath10 differential cross - section differ both in the backward and in the forward regions with the overall best description of the cms data coming from kp npdf .",
    "the ratios in fig.[fig : wcmseta ] indicate that the kp model predicts similar nuclear modifications ( suppression ) for @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the forward region , but somewhat different corrections in the backward region .",
    "this behavior can be explained with the flavor dependence of the nuclear modifications in the kp model . as shown in fig.[fig : npdfs ] , the kp nuclear modifications on @xmath96 and @xmath97 quarks are different in the large-@xmath8 ( valence - quark dominated ) region .",
    "differences are also present between nuclear @xmath138 and @xmath139 . since the productions of @xmath9 and @xmath10 are dominated by different flavors ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath9 by @xmath96 and @xmath139 , and @xmath10 by @xmath97 and @xmath138 ) , the corresponding rapidity distributions are good observables to study the flavor dependence of nuclear modifications to pdfs .",
    "we note that different nuclear corrections for valence and sea quarks ( @xmath140 vs. @xmath141 in fig.[fig : npdfs ] ) can also show up in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 rapidity distribution , since @xmath9 and @xmath10 production cross sections involve different share of valence ( or sea ) quarks .",
    "for instance , at lo nuclear processes intiated by valence quarks contribute about @xmath142 to the @xmath9 and @xmath143 to the @xmath10 , at @xmath144 . as a result ,",
    "the differences in model predictions seen in fig.[fig : wcmseta ] are mostly caused by different behavior of nuclear modifications in the eps09 and kp model shown in fig.[fig : npdfs ] and only marginally affected by the differences between the abmp15 and ct10 pdf sets .",
    "our results on the forward - backward asymmetry for @xmath1 production , as a function of the charged - lepton pseudo - rapidity in the laboratory frame , are illustrated in fig.[fig : wcmsfb ] .",

    "the predictions with the kp nuclear pdfs can describe very well the cms data over the entire kinematic range .",
    "similar results are obtained from the calculation based upon the proton pdfs abmp15 .",
    "the kp nuclear modifications suppress the charge asymmetry in the region @xmath147 , due to the flavor dependence of the correction in the valence - quark dominated region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : npdfs ] ) and partially to the different nuclear modifications for valence and sea quarks , as discussed above . from fig.[fig : wcmscas ] we can also see that the eps09 parameterization of nuclear modifications predicts a rather different shape for the charge asymmetry with respect to the kp model .",
    "we note that the differences in the underlying proton pdfs play a larger role in the @xmath3 charge asymmetry than in other observables since the effect of nuclear corrections is reduced in the @xmath146 ratio .",
    "the backward region is dominated by the valence quarks in the lead nucleus , while the forward region is related to the large-@xmath8 partons in the forward going proton .",
    "therefore , the @xmath148 proton pdf ratio at large @xmath8 is particularly relevant for the @xmath3 charge asymmetry , as well as the @xmath149 ratio at small @xmath8 .",
    "figure  [ fig : zcms ] summarizes our results on the differential cross section and the corresponding forward - backward asymmetry for @xmath2 production in p+pb collisions at @xmath135  tev , as a function of the @xmath2 rapidity in the center - of - mass frame of the nucleon - nucleon collision .",
    "in particular , the @xmath2 forward - backward asymmetry @xmath145 offers a clean probe for the study of cold medium nuclear effects  @xcite .",
    "the kp nuclear modifications suppress the rate of @xmath2 production in the forward rapidy region and slightly enhances it in the backward rapidity region ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "the resulting forward - backward asymmetry is therefore suppressed , similarly to the case of @xmath1 production .",
    "the kp predictions are in very good agreement with the cms data for both the differential cross - section and the forward - backward asymmetry .",
    "figure  [ fig : zcms ] shows that the results based on the kp model and the eps09 parameterization are somewhat different .",
    "the difference is mainly related to the corresponding nuclear modification factors of pdfs , since our results for @xmath2 production in @xmath26 collisions ( see fig.[z_pp_cms ] ) indicate that the abmp15 and ct10 predictions are fully consistent . for the parton kinematics associated to the backward rapidity region , @xmath151 ,",
    "the eps09 nuclear modifications lead to a stronger enhancement than the kp model for both the valence and sea quark distributions ( see fig.[fig : npdfs ] ) .",
    "similarly , in the region @xmath152 , corresponding to the forward direction , the eps09 introduces a stronger suppression of the valence quarks ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : npdfs ] ) . as a result",
    ", the eps09 predicts lower values for the forward - backward asymmetry with respect to the kp model .        from the study of @xmath5 production in p+pb collisions discussed above we found that the use of kp nuclear pdfs results in an excellent description of the recent cms data in the entire kinematic range .",
    "as the kp npdf model is based on a detailed microscopic model ( see sec.[sec : npdf ] ) we can sort out the contributions from different mechanisms responsible for the nuclear modification of pdfs . in order to discuss the sensitivity of cms data to individual nuclear effects we define the kp nuclear modification ratio for the @xmath5 differential cross - sections as : @xmath153 where @xmath126 should be replaced by @xmath154 for @xmath2 production .",
    "we evaluate this ratio using different combinations of nuclear effects in the kp model , as summarized in sec.[sec : npdf ] : a ) fermi motion and binding correction ( fmb ) only ; b ) fmb+ off - shell correction ( os ) ; c ) fmb+os+ coherent corrections related to nuclear shadowing ( ns ) ; and d ) the complete model fmb+os+ns+ meson exchange currents ( mec ) .",
    "results are shown in fig.[fig : wcmskp ] for the @xmath9 and @xmath10 differential cross - sections in p+pb collisions at @xmath135  tev , together with the corresponding cms data  @xcite .",
    "for a better understanding of the various nuclear effects at the parton level in the upper scale we also show the values of the bjorken variable @xmath118 obtained from eq.([eq : y - x ] ) .",
    "the relative impact of each individual nuclear effect on the cross - sections can be evaluated from the difference of the ratios defined in eq.([eq : rppb ] ) with and without the effect considered , as shown in fig.[fig : wcmskp ] .    from fig.[fig : wcmskp ] we can observe that the kinematical coverage of @xmath1 production in p+pb collisions at the lhc cms experiment is sensitive to all four physics mechanisms responsible for the nuclear modification of pdfs . a comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig : dispbau ] shows that in the probed region of the bjorken @xmath8 we expect significant variations in the nuclear corrections . while the size of the combined effect of fmb+os at large @xmath8 is comparable in dis and @xmath1 production , the shadowing correction in fig .",
    "[ fig : wcmskp ] appears to be substantially reduced with respect to the nuclear dis .",
    "this is because the corresponding @xmath6 scale differs by 4 orders of magnitude ( @xmath115 for fixed - target dis in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispbau ] and @xmath155 for fig.[fig : npdfs ] ) and the corresponding effective cross sections driving corrections at small @xmath8 ( see sec.[sec : npdf ] ) are significantly different @xcite .",
    "the fmb and os corrections dominate the backward region @xmath156 , mainly due to their effect in the valence - quark region @xmath157 .",
    "in this rapidity region the fmb correction is negative ( suppression ) , while the corresponding os correction is positive ( enhancement ) , for both @xmath9 and @xmath10 production . in the forward region",
    "fig.[fig : wcmskp ] shows a suppression as a result of the nuclear shadowing on small-@xmath8 partons .",
    "the enhancement observed in the intermediate and backward regions can be related to the nuclear meson correction , affecting the nuclear sea quark distributions ( mainly @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) for @xmath158 .",
    "it is worth noting that the shadowing corrections on @xmath9 and @xmath10 production appear to be similar .",
    "instead , differences between @xmath9 and @xmath10 are observed in the nuclear corrections originated by the other physics mechanisms as a consequence of their flavor dependence ( @xmath159 , and @xmath160 in fig .",

    "figure  [ fig : wcmskp ] indicates that the cms data are rather sensitive to the off - shell correction . as discussed in section  [ sec : npdf ] , the off - shell effect plays an important role in the kp model of nuclear pdfs ( together with the fmb ) , through the off - shell structure function @xmath57 in eq.([sf : os ] ) .",
