    "the interplay between physics at hadron colliders and that at @xmath0 machines has traditionally been of great significance in furthering our understanding of elementary particles and their interactions .",
    "one can for example point to the specific case of the discovery of the @xmath1 boson at a hadron collider @xcite which was then followed by high precision phenomenology at lep which helped to establish firmly the standard model of particle physics , the current theory of elementary particles beyond which any discoveries are still to be made .",
    "this tradition is set to continue with the strong expectation that the lhc will lead to the discovery of the higgs boson or help to clarify the higgs sector as well as enabling the discovery of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the extremely high energy hadronic collisions at the lhc , which make it a powerful discovery machine , however come with a price which takes the form of a more complicated initial state ( protons rather than elementary particles ) and complications concerning non - perturbative effects such as beam remnant interactions ( the underlying event ) and pile - up which threaten to limit the theoretical precision that one may be able to obtain .",
    "the most precise determination of the parameters of the new physics such as masses and couplings would probably require a cleaner environment such as a high energy @xmath0 future linear collider .",
    "nevertheless as the tevatron experience has to an extent confirmed , calculations in perturbative qcd will have a strong role to play in the physics program of the lhc , particularly with regards to estimating accurately backgrounds to new physics .",
    "to this end significant effort has been devoted in the past years to develop qcd calculations specifically for important lhc processes in the discovery context .",
    "moreover given the vast scale hierarchy inherent in high energy hadron collider physics ( with scales ranging from the tev range centre - of  mass energy @xmath2 , through typical jet transverse momenta @xmath3 , the masses of electroweak scale particles down to the few gev scales associated to non - perturbative physics ) it is clear that techniques involving summation of large logarithms in scale ratios would also be important in maximising the theoretical accuracy one may be able to achieve .",
    "the introduction of new and faster infrared and collinear ( irc ) safe jet algorithms and a systematic understanding of perturbative and non - perturbative properties of jets and jet substructure is also a rapidly developing and vital part of the current and future lhc physics program .    at the same time , as should be clear from the preceding discussion , furthering the precision of qcd calculations for @xmath0 annihilation remains of continued importance for future phenomenology as well as remaining a simpler learning and testing ground for qcd practitioners . in this context",
    "the development of next - to  next to leading order ( nnlo ) predictions and taking resummed computations from the state of the art next - to  leading logarithmic ( nll ) level through to nnll accuracy as well as possibly improving the current theoretical understanding of non - perturbative effects such as hadronisation corrections will all play an important role .    in",
    "what follows below we present a brief summary of what we perceive to be some of the main developments and recent progress in qcd calculations for both hadron colliders and @xmath0 machines .",
    "it is impossible due to page limitations to adequately cover all the relevant progress that has been made in the past few years and thus the selection of topics / references below is far from complete .",
    "we shall aim to discuss briefly the progress in fixed - order perturbative computations as well as all - order resummations both in the hadron collider and the @xmath0 context , mention the status of @xmath4 measurements and discuss progress in the definition and understanding of jets and their properties in and beyond qcd perturbation theory .",
    "observables that have the property of infrared and collinear ( irc ) safety can be calculated as an expansion in the strong coupling @xmath4 using perturbative techniques based on the evaluation of feynman graphs . by an irc",
    "safe observable one essentially means the following : let @xmath5 denote the value of the observable @xmath6 due to a configuration involving @xmath7 partons with momenta @xmath8 .",
    "now consider adding an extra parton with momentum @xmath9 . in the soft limit that the energy @xmath10 ( with @xmath11 held finite ) or the limit that @xmath12 where @xmath13 i.e the limit in which the three - momentum @xmath14 is parallel to any of the three - momenta @xmath15 ( collinear limit ) irc safety implies that independent of @xmath7 , @xmath16 .",
    "irc safety ensures that real - virtual cancellation of divergences occurs and hence that finite results are obtained in perturbation theory .    for a simple observable of the above kind , @xmath17 , involving a single hard scale @xmath18",
    ", we can then write the perturbation expansion as @xmath19 where @xmath20 are perturbatively calculable coefficients , @xmath21 is the hard scale of the process and @xmath22 an arbitrary renormalisation scale , which however should be chosen to be of order @xmath21 to avoid large logarithms in @xmath23 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath22 would in fact cancel if one were able to compute the observable to all orders exactly but in practice one is able to evaluate only a few terms in the above sum .",
    "the residual @xmath22 dependence in a calculation truncated at @xmath24 order in @xmath4 is of the order of uncalculated @xmath25 terms .",
    "thus scale dependence is usually taken as a measure of the influence of uncalculated higher orders and hence the theoretical accuracy of a given prediction .    generally speaking leading order ( lo ) calculations are too crude to be considered reliable estimates for most collider observables .",
    "nlo calculations on the other hand may be expected to be correct , broadly speaking , to within order 10 percent while nnlo calculations represent high precision and as a rule of thumb ought to be accurate to within a few percent or so .    )",
    "distribution for inclusive @xmath1 production at the lhc .",
    "figure taken from ref .",
    "@xcite.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    an illustration of this is provided in fig .   1 where one notes the progressive reduction in scale uncertainty with the increasing order of the perturbative evaluation for the case of the inclusive @xmath1 rapidity distribution for the lhc .    for reliable estimates of backgrounds",
    "to lhc processes with new physics it would thus appear that at least nlo accuracy is a must .",
    "for up to the production of three jets at hadron colliders nlo calculations encoded in the program nlojet++ have been available for some time @xcite .",
    "however many of the relevant discovery processes involve high multiplicity final states with similar backgrounds involving e.g multiple hard final state jets for which it is much less straightforward to obtain nlo estimates . at present",
    "the current state of the art for nlo computations at hadron colliders is for @xmath26 processes such as a @xmath27 final state relevant for higgs production and decay in association with a @xmath28 pair @xcite .",
    "similarly nlo calculations to @xmath29 @xcite and @xmath30 @xcite have been recently computed .",
    "a significant development in the computation of nlo corrections has been the advent of unitarity based calculational methods alongside traditional feynman - diagram techniques . a pedagogical review and further references can be found in ref .",
    "the automation of nlo computations is also an important step towards the calculation of several different collider processes .",
    "the automation of both real radiation terms @xcite and virtual corrections @xcite has been achieved in the past few years , for nlo corrections .",
    "as far as nnlo calculations are concerned only a few processes are known to such accuracy .",
    "for instance for hadron collisons fully exclusive nnlo corrections to vector boson production have been computed @xcite while for the case of @xmath0 annihilation similar calculations have been performed using the method of antenna subtraction for the case of @xmath31 which has enabled a more accurate determination of @xmath4 from data on lep event shape variables @xcite .",
    "having briefly summarised the state of the art for qcd calculations at fixed - order we shall turn our attention to those observables where the involvement of more than one perturbative scale forces us to go beyond fixed - order perturbation theory using resummation methods .",
    "as mentioned above there exist several observables of phenomenological interest where multiple scales ( typically the process hard scale and other scales introduced due to observable definition ) play an important role . for such observables ,",
    "the classic examples of which remain event or jet shape variable distributions @xcite , one has to consider the role of large logarithms in scale ratios and examine the possibility to resum these to all orders at a given logarithmic accuracy .    to be more explicit consider the distribution in some shape variable @xmath32 in say @xmath0 annihilation : @xmath33    the above behavior reflects the double - logarithmic enhancement of the shape cross - section due to soft and collinear gluon emissions while the ellipsis denote less singular terms some of which also need to be accounted for for phenomenological purposes .",
    "this result is clearly divergent and unphysical at small @xmath32 which reflects the inadequacy of fixed - order predictions in that region and hence the need for resummation .",
    "on resummation , for those variables that have the property of exponentiation @xcite one can write a result of the form @xmath34 which generalises with account of running coupling and less singular terms into the form ( @xmath35 ) : @xmath36.\\ ] ]    in the above result the leading and next - to  leading logarithmic ( nll ) terms are represented by the functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the current state - of  the art for most observables at any collider process is nll accuracy in the resummed exponent .",
    "the nnll function @xmath39 is known only for some select variables amongst which are the thrust and heavy jet - mass distribution in @xmath0 annihilation ( in fact computed in the framework of soft - collinear effective theory to @xmath40 accuracy @xcite ) and for hadron collisions the drell - yan and higgs transverse momentum ( @xmath41 ) distribution ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "most recently for the drell - yan case results have also been obtained including nnll accuracy for the new @xmath42 and @xmath43 variables measured by the d0 collaboration @xcite which broadly speaking are in good agreement with the data even without inclusion of non - perturbative effects @xcite .    for @xmath0 annihilation",
    "the role of resummation in ensuring precision phenomenology has been clear for a long time @xcite .",
    "[ fig : scet ]    consider as a recent example the comparison between various levels of resummation , event generators and @xmath0 event shape data depicted in fig .  2 .",
    "at the @xmath1 peak it appears that there is excellent agreement between pythia ( at hadron level ) and data .",
    "moreover the pythia ( parton level ) result appears rather closer to the @xmath44 ( @xmath45 order ) curve than to the ll result which is where one may expect it to be . that this is an effect which arises due to uncontrolled sub - leading terms and the tuning procedure inherent in pythia is revealed by going to @xmath46 tev , where for example subleading effects would be inconsequential",
    ", pythia is much closer to the ll rather than the @xmath44 result .",
    "it has hence been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite that using ll mc generators may potentially lead to a significant underestimate of certain qcd backgrounds at a future ilc ( at about the few tens of percent level ) .",
    "[ fig : cae ]    while accurate resummed predictions have been an important requirement in say the determination of @xmath4 from lep event shapes , they are also in principle of great value for jet production in hadron collisions in terms of improving perturbative accuracy . however the more complex hadronic environment at a hadron collider makes all - order resummation a rather delicate affair",
    ". for instance care has to be taken in constructing observables such as event shapes to avoid contamination from beam remnants by constructing suitably central event shapes which then have the property of being non - global @xcite .",
    "since the non - global single logarithms can not be computed beyond the large @xmath47 limit , in order to ensure full nll accuracy for observables such as event shapes in hadronic dijet production , the observables have to be further modified in such a way so as to ensure globalness , such as those variables studied in ref .",
    "a yet more troublesome issue is the contamination as a result of effects such as pile - up which can potentially override the eventual accuracy which can be achieved via theoretical methods such as resummation .",
    "it is thus desirable to seek variables that are less prone to such effects in order to test resummed calculations hadron collider observables .",
    "predictions for several hadron collider event shape variables as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite are shown in fig .",
    "3 . in some cases",
    "some discrepancy with corresponding results from leading - log and leading colour event generators such as herwig can also be noted . for more detailed comments on the role of tuning and the shower parameters in such comparisons",
    "we refer the reader to the comments in ref .",
    "detailed phenomenological studies for hadron collider event shape variables are currently in progress @xcite .    aside from a limited number of global event shapes and observables such as suitably defined dijet azimuthal correlations @xcite as well as drell - yan @xmath41 spectra , one may try to study via resummation other observables involving for instance jet - definition and the application of a jet algorithm .",
    "as an example of this one can point to the case of jet masses and shapes for high @xmath3 jets at the lhc which are relevant in identifying the origin of a jet as being initiated by a qcd process ( quark or gluon jet ) or say by the decay of a boosted heavy particle .",
    "the qcd jet mass distribution for example would receive logarithmic enhancements @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the transverse momentum and @xmath50 the jet mass , with @xmath51 being the jet radius . since at the lhc we will encounter jets with @xmath49 in the tev range , the role of such logarithmic terms",
    "can be expected to be substantial even up to jet masses near the electroweak scale .",
    "the resummation of such logarithms while being immensely desirable from the standpoint of perturbative accuracy however has complex issues mainly to do with the role of non - global logarithms and jet algorithms and was recently discussed in ref .",
    "while a very high formal level of precision in such cases is essentially ruled out it should still be possible to develop resummation formulae that capture the numerically dominant terms in the result to sufficient accuracy for phenomenological purposes .",
    "we conclude this section by presenting in fig .  4 , the current status of @xmath4 determinations taken from ref .",
    "the 2009 value for the world average for @xmath52 was reported as @xmath53 .",
    "the individual contributions from various qcd observables used for @xmath4 extraction are also shown in fig .  4 .",
    "[ fig : asbet ]   values extracted from various qcd studies alongwith the world average value ( dashed vertical line ) and error ( yellow band ) . taken from the comprehensive 2009 review @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "although the precise definition of qcd jets may appear a detail not necessarily directly relevant to progress of high order qcd calculations discussed in the major part of this review , it is in fact the case that such calculational developments need to be supported by suitable irc safe jet definitions . in",
    "other words higher order perturbative estimates for jet cross - sections and differential distributions only make sense when an infrared and collinear safe jet algorithm is used in jet definition .",
    "although in many cases of interest such as inclusive jet @xmath3 spectra the irc unsafety of a given jet algorithms may only appear at a relatively high order , for several lhc processes involving large multiplicity of final state jets ( say as backgrounds to a new physics process ) the irc unsafety may appear already at leading order invalidating any level of perturbative accuracy @xcite .",
    "likewise it is not meaningful to compute all - order resummed predictions for quantities that will diverge at any fixed order due to the algorithm in use .",
    "this requirement coupled with experimental and practical considerations ( speed of the algorithm for high multiplicity hadronic final states ) make the definition of jets a non - trivial task . fortunately there now exist several different practically feasible options for irc safe jet definitions defined either using sequential recombination @xcite or based on the idea of cone jets @xcite .",
    "the recent fast progress in the field of jet physics are expertly reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite to which we point the interested reader for further details .    as a by product of the rapid developments in jet physics",
    "there has also recently been tremendous interest in using a somewhat more sophisticated understanding of jets and their properties , gained via relatively simple analytical calculations , as a chisel for improving the prominence of new physics signals at the lhc .",
    "for example the idea of the optimal value of jet radius @xmath51 to be employed in various searches for new physics at the lhc based on analytical estimates of both perturbative radiation and non - perturbative hadronisation corrections was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "moreover ideas about jet substructure @xcite have contributed to an explosion in the production of tools which can be used to distinguish qcd jets from those produced by the decays of massive particles in the highly boosted regime where the decay products may be captured within a single jet . for a detailed exposition of substructure techniques we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .    to conclude we finish with a reminder that much of the progress in developing qcd precision tools and the consequent improvement in understanding qcd effects whether in the context of hadron colliders or @xmath0 machines should ultimately yield benefits beyond the particular context within which it was initiated .",
    "for instance the need for developing theoretical methods to further the precision that can be obtained via perturbative techniques at the lhc should in many cases ultimately have spin - offs that would pay dividend in the attainment of even higher precision at future linear colliders .",
    "there is thus much reason to be optimistic in light of the fact that the pace of developments of qcd tools continues to be rapid ( and possibly even accelerated ) stimulated in large part by the advent of lhc data .              ;",
