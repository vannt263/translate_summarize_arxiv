    "this form of temperature dependence matches with the behavior of magnetization obtained from ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "thus , our holographic dual model reproduces the well - known behavior of magnetization near @xmath61 .     for @xmath75 and the functions ( [ eq : curie weiss ] ) with @xmath76 and @xmath77.,width=302 ]    next ,",
    "the numerical results of temperature dependence of the susceptibility near @xmath61 is summarized in fig.[fig2 ] for @xmath75 . as expected , the susceptibility @xmath78 diverges at @xmath61 , and the behavior around @xmath47 is well fitted with the functions , @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are constants in front of the temperature dependent part of the susceptibility below and above @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the curie - weiss law for the magnetic susceptibility near the phase transition point .",
    "interestingly , we find that the ratio of the constants @xmath82 takes its values in the range of @xmath83 for @xmath84 ( e.g. , @xmath85 for @xmath75 ) .",
    "these values are close to the ratio @xmath86 obtained from ginzburg - landau theory , and the small deviations may indicate our holographic dual approach is slightly beyond the mean field approximation .     for @xmath87 and @xmath88 and the fitting function ( [ eq : capacitytc ] ) with @xmath89.,width=302 ]    finally , the behavior of the free energy @xmath90 near @xmath61 turns out to be the following form @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a positive constant . the numerical results for @xmath75 are shown in fig.[fig3 ] .    in summary ,",

    "and the fitting function ( [ eq : fitfn magzero ] ) with @xmath98 and @xmath99.,width=302 ]        for the magnetization , we find that the temperature dependence in the low temperature region is approximately given by @xmath100 the fitting plot in the low temperature region is shown in fig.[fig4 ] for @xmath74",
    ". the power law reduction of the magnetization at low temperatures , which goes as @xmath101 , is known as the bloch @xmath102 law @xcite .",
    "this dependence originates from the existence of spin wave excitations ( or magnons ) and shows that spin wave approximation is valid for the low - temperature ferromagnets .",
    "our results ( [ eq : fitfn magzero ] ) are consistent with this behavior , and the holographic dual model also reproduces the bloch s law for magnetizations .",
    "this dependence indicates that our system is indeed dual to a ferromagnetic system , not an anti - ferromagnetic system .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that the numerical results of @xmath60 in the near-@xmath61 and the low - temperature regions are smoothly connected in our holographic calculation .",
    "the results regarding to the magnetization indicate that our holographic dual model in eq .",
    "( [ eq : holo action ] ) is capable of consistently describing both the mean field approximation near @xmath61 and spin wave approximation at low temperatures in a unified way .    as for the magnetic susceptibility , the behavior in the low temperature region",

    "the first constant term @xmath106 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi low temp ] ) can be interpreted as the pauli paramagnetic susceptibility from free electrons , and the fractional power law behavior of the second term implies the contribution from magnons . even without any fermionic field on the action in eq .",
    "( [ eq : holo action ] ) , the effect of fermions on the ferromagnetic side , which leads to the constant part of the susceptibility ( i.e. conduction electron ) , can be possibly captured by our holographic model in the level of an effective theory .",
    "finally , the temperature dependence of free energy at low temperatures is shown in fig.[fig5 ] ( b ) for @xmath87 .",
    "the results for free energy @xmath90 from the holographic dual model can be fitted with the following form , @xmath107 where @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 are positive constants . here",
    ", @xmath110 gives the coefficient linear in @xmath44 of the specific heat .",
    "this temperature dependence for the low - temperature region is consistent with the standard linear dependence of the specific heat for free electrons ( or for the fermi liquid ) .",
    "interestingly , this result also indicates the existence of conduction electrons in our holographic dual ferromagnets .    the low temperature behaviors in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fitfn magzero ] ) , ( [ eq : chi low temp ] ) , and ( [ eq : fzero ] ) indicate our holographic dual model ( [ eq : holo action ] ) actually corresponds to the ferromagnetic system with not only localized spins but also conduction electrons , such as models with the @xmath111-@xmath4 exchange interaction @xcite .",
    "although the analysis in this letter is performed based on the probe approximation , where the back reaction from the scalar field @xmath70 is ignored , we expect the qualitative feature of the above results will be robust beyond this approximation . indeed , in the limit of @xmath112",
    ", we can safely neglect the contribution of @xmath70 to the energy - momentum tensor in the einstein equation and our analysis is justified even in the low temperature region , as discussed in ref .",
    "in summary , we have developed a holographic dictionary between a @xmath113-dimensional gravitational system and a @xmath114-dimensional ferromagnetic system . using the holographic dictionary",

    ", we found the bloch s @xmath102 law indicating the presence of the spin wave excitations , and moreover , the susceptibility and free energy exhibited signatures of conduction electrons .",
    "these results at the low temperatures indicate that our holographic model automatically captures the entire spectrum of ferromagnetic systems incorporating both spin and electronic degrees of freedom , and thus this model can develop into new effective descriptions of ferromagnetic systems useful for spintronics .",
