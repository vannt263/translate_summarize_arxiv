    "fluorine ( f ) is probably the element whose nucleosynthetic origin is least known .",
    "the reason for the scarcity of knowledge is the fragility of its only stable isotope ( @xmath1f ) and the lack of measurable atomic lines in the optical spectral range of normal stars . apart from uv measurements of highly ionized f in very hot stars @xcite and optical measurements of neutral f in extreme helium stars @xcite , the only source of information on stellar f abundances are vibration - rotation lines of the hydrofluoric acid ( hf ) .",
    "the hf molecule is efficiently formed in cool stellar atmospheres ( types @xmath2k0 and later ) , and a number of strong lines appear in the near - ir @xmath3-band .",
    "the first identification of stellar hf lines has been reported by @xcite ; lines of this molecule have been used by @xcite to measure f abundances outside the solar system for the first time .",
    "several astrophysical sites for the synthesis of f have been proposed .",
    "it has been confirmed by @xcite through the correlation with the abundance of carbon that agb stars are indeed producers of f. this was also supported by a recent study of f abundances in agb stars of the lmc cluster ngc  1846 @xcite .",
    "whether or not agb stars are the _",
    "main _ producers of f is still a matter of debate .",
    "@xcite estimate that agb stars contribute to as much as 25% of the solar system fluorine , but they emphasize the roughness of their estimate .",
    "@xcite in this respect rather suggest , based on observations of two red giants in the globular cluster @xmath4  cen , that @xmath1f is created by neutrino nucleosynthesis ( @xmath5-process ) during core collapse in supernovae of type  ii ( sne  ii * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , @xcite did not find a clear indication for enhanced f abundance resulting from the @xmath5-process in a region shaped by past supernovae .",
    "finally , the wolf - rayet phase of massive stars was investigated as a third site of f production by @xcite .",
    "the agb phase is the final phase of nuclear processing for a broad initial mass range between 0.8 and 8m@xmath6 . in this phase",
    ", the interior of the star is structured in the following way : the inert carbon - oxygen core is surrounded by a he - burning shell , on top of which is a he - rich shell , in turn surrounded by a h - burning shell .",
    "the outer h - rich envelope is fully convective and fills most of the star s volume .",
    "the he - burning shell ignites only temporarily during so - called he - shell flashes or thermal pulses ( tps ) to release large amounts of energy . during a tp",
    "the he - rich shell gets thoroughly mixed and is the site of rich nucleosynthesis ( e.g.  the s - process ) . for a comprehensive review of agb evolution see e.g.  @xcite . among many others , @xmath1f",
    "is produced via complex reaction chains under these conditions , or destroyed via @xmath7 captures forming @xmath8ne . at very high neutron densities ,",
    "also n captures lead to a destruction of f. for a discussion of the relevant reactions see @xcite .",
    "the processed matter is brought to the stellar surface via third dredge - up ( tdu ) mixing events , which may operate after each tp .",
    "only few stellar systems have been investigated with respect to the abundance of f : besides _ galactic _ field red giants @xcite , similar stars have been observed in the globular cluster m4 @xcite , as well as in @xmath4cen and the lmc @xcite . @xcite",
    "add f to the list of elements known to vary in globular cluster stars and draw conclusions on the early - cluster chemical pollution .",
    "@xcite recently presented the measurement of f in a very metal - poor star and found a considerable overabundance of this rare element .",
    "in this paper we report the measurement of the f abundance in a ms spectral type bulge agb variable , i.e.  an agb star with an o - rich chemistry enriched in s - process elements .",
    "it is the first measurement of this kind in a star of the galactic bulge , and one of few f abundance determinations from a tdu - agb star .",
    "the observations have been carried out with the crires infra - red spectrograph .",
    "crires is the cryogenic infra - red echelle spectrograph mounted to the nasmyth focus a at the 8.2 m unit telescope # 1 ( antu ) of eso s vlt on cerro paranal , chile .",
    "it has been installed at the telescope in 2006 followed by several commissioning and science verification runs .",
    "crires is designed for high spectral resolution ( @xmath9 up to @xmath10 ) and operates in the spectral range . a curvature sensing adaptive optics system feed is used to minimize slit losses and to provide diffraction limited spatial resolution along the slit .",
    "more details about the crires instrument can be found in @xcite and on - line at www.eso.org / instruments / crires/. one star observed during the first crires commissioning run in june 2006 was the bulge mira variable @xcite , also known as plaut  3 - 1347 or v2017  sgr ( j2000 coordinates : 18@xmath11 38@xmath12 457 @xmath1334  33  28 ) . with a galactic latitude of about @xmath13126 it belongs to the outer bulge .",
    "the observations of m1347 were carried out on june 07 , 2006 .",
    "a large part of the near - ir k - band was observed , although the analysis presented here is limited to two wavelength settings covering the range .",
    "the slit - width was set to 02 ; thus , the maximum resolution of 100000 ( 3kms@xmath14 equivalent ) was achieved .",
    "the integration time was 60s for each of the four nodding positions per setting .",
    "a hot standard star at similar airmass was observed immediately afterwards .",
    "the raw frames were reduced with the crires pipeline ( version 0.2.3 ) , and the 1d science and standard star spectra were wavelength - calibrated separately using the numerous telluric absorption lines present on all of the four detector arrays .",
    "the wavelength - calibration was done separately for the science and telluric standard star spectrum because of the limited reproducibility of the echelle grating position .",
    "finally , the science spectrum was divided by the standard star spectrum to correct for the telluric lines and the illumination pattern as well as possible .",
    "note that the telluric lines are strong enough to use them as wavelength calibrator , but they are weak enough to be corrected for by standard star division ; thus they have no influence on the abundance measurements presented here .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio was estimated from an overlapping region on chip # 3 that was observed in both settings to be close to 100 .",

    "no high - mass stars reaching because of dredge - up of carbon on the tp - agb are present anymore . below roughly 1.4m@xmath6 no",
    "dredge - up occurs at all , preventing a star to become s - process enriched .",
    "note that the former constraint would not hold for a disk star , since it then could be a higher mass star on its way to experiencing one of its first tdu events on the tp - agb .",
    "additional constraints come from the diagram . using linear pulsation models @xcite m1347",

    "[ m1347hf ] .    from table",
    "[ hf_lines ] it becomes obvious that the f abundances required to fit the different hf lines have a large spread .",
    "this is most probably because some of the observed lines are blended , and the respective blending line is not adequately represented in any of the used line lists .",
    "there exists a general problem of uncertain or simply incomplete ( molecular ) line data in terms of wavelength and/or @xmath47 value which becomes particularly apparent at the high resolution of the present spectra .",

    "* is one of few examples ) . in the wavelength region",
    "analysed here , line data are uncertain especially for the cn list ( see below ) .",
    "also , dynamic and mass loss effects may lead to the formation of spectral lines which are not formed in hydrostatic atmosphere models used here @xcite .",
    "the rotational lines inside a certain vibrational band of di - atomic molecules reach a maximum strength at a certain rotation quantum number , depending on the gas temperature . for the hf 1@xmath130 band , this",
    "maximum is reached at the r5 line for the temperatures of the hf line forming layers . for higher and lower rotation quantum numbers",
    "the line strengths ( opacities ) will decrease monotonically .",
    "some lines in our observed spectrum clearly deviate from this trend ; these are the r17 , r18 , r20 , and r21 lines .",
    "although at least the r17 and r21 lines do not appear asymmetric , which would definitely hint at their blended nature , a blend of unknown origin and strength is assumed for these lines .",
    "the r18 and r20 lines have a rather asymmetric profile and are thus certainly blended .",
    "the r19 line is blended with a cn line in the synthetic as well as in the observed spectrum , but the contribution by cn seems to be well modelled .",
    "cn has been discarded from the list of molecules used for the spectral synthesis of the r22 line because a cn feature appeared in the red wing which is not present in the observed spectrum .",
    "also r23 , the highest - lying detected line , is problematic .",
    "it is blended with a cn line , too , with only a minor contribution by hf .",
    "we thus decided to exclude the lines r17 , r18 , r20 , r21 , and r23 from the determination of the average f abundance .",
    "the average f abundance from the remaining five lines in this `` cleaned '' list ( r14 , r15 , r16 , r19 , and r22 ) , calculated by converting the individual f abundances to a linear scale before averaging them and converting the average back to the logarithmic scale , is .",
    "the differences between observed and synthetic ews of these lines , weighted with the inverse of their ew , reach least squares at .",
    "we note that there is perhaps a trend of increasing [ f / h ] with increasing rotation quantum number even in the cleaned list of lines . due to the very good agreement in terms of wavelength and gf values between the hitran and the tipping line data for the lines up to r14 we regard incorrect line data as the source of this trend as unlikely .",
    "we performed abundance measurements with a model atmosphere with an effective temperature increased by 200k ( i.e.3400k ) ; however , the trend remained .",
    "thus , the trend is obviously not connected to a wrong temperature estimate .",
    "the only solution we can offer at the moment is that the trend might be related to a deviation of the temperature structure of the model atmosphere from that of the real atmopshere , but this has to be regarded as tentative .",
    "whatever the reason for the trend is , we again want to stress that our study is only the second which employs more than one line to derive f abundances from hf lines .      determining abundances in a bulge mira star is a tricky task . unlike for globular cluster stars ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , no a priori value of the metallicity is known , and the temperatures of cool , pulsating mira variables are difficult to measure precisely , not to mention other stellar parameters . the uncertainty on the f abundance derived here , as shown below , is higher than found in other studies ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "a large source of error , due to its effects on molecule dissociation and level population , is the uncertainty in the effective temperature . by varying the temperature of the model atmosphere by @xmath24k , which is a good measure of the temperature uncertainty",
    ", we find a variation of [ f / h ] of @xmath52dex from all lines in the cleaned list .",
    "the metallicity [ m / h ] has an impact on the measured f abundance comparable to that of the effective temperature because of its influence on the atmospheric structure .",
    "we therefore calculated spectra at the metallicities of the upper and lower limits of the metallicity range of m1347 ( steps of @xmath53 to the adopted value of ) .",
    "in fact , we found that the f abundance changes in lockstep with changes in the metallicity , which translates into an uncertainty of the f abundance of the same magnitude as the uncertainty in [ m / h ] .",
    "the hf lines become stronger upon decreasing the overall metallicity while keeping the f abundance constant , thus a lower metallicity of the model atmosphere results in an f abundance lowered by the same amount .",
    "the surface gravity @xmath54 has only a minor effect on the derived f abundance .",
    "increasing @xmath54 from @xmath42 to @xmath55 , a range generally occupied by red giant stars , leads to an f abundance reduced by 0.04dex .",
    "the values of the macro- and micro - turbulent velocities , @xmath56 and @xmath48 , could be checked for from the profiles of the hf lines in the cleaned list .",
    "a value of @xmath57 for both of them was found to very satisfyingly reproduce the profiles . a deviation of the sum of @xmath58 by more than @xmath59 leads to line profiles noticeably different from the observed profiles .",
    "this maximum deviation leads to an uncertainty of [ f / h ] of @xmath60dex .",
    "the specific value of the c / o ratio , which may differ from the solar value due to first and third dredge - up processes , may have an influence on the f abundance measurement in three different ways .",
    "first , it influences the strength of the tio bands used for the temperature determination .",
    "second , the atmospheric structure depends on the c / o ratio .",
    "the c / o ratio influences the strength of lines blended with the hf lines , in particular of the very c / o - sensitive cn lines .    from a number of cn lines falling in the wavelength range observed with crires which are identified in the arcturus spectral atlas of @xcite",
    ", we estimate that the c / o ratio in the atmosphere of m1347 is around 0.7 . since with the present data we can not have an independent check on the o and n abundance , solar o and n abundances were assumed in this estimate .",
    "the occurrence of lithium in m1347 has been ascribed to cbp acting in this star @xcite .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , the n abundance could be possibly enhanced because some @xmath26c will be converted to @xmath61n by cn cycling .",
    "we expect that the effect of this shift on the cn lines is a minor one .    because the cn lines in the observed spectrum can by far be not as well fitted as the hf lines , our estimate of the c / o ratio is quite rough .",
    "for this reason , we decided to not change the c / o ratio of the model atmosphere that was used for the abundance analysis from its adopted value of 0.48 .",
    "we rather estimate from the difference to what the effect on the measurement of the f abundance is .",
    "we found from our model atmospheres that an increased c / o ratio _",
    "increases _ the strength of tio bands ( which were used for the temperature determination ) .",
    "a naive expectation would be a decrease in tio band strength because less o is available to form tio as c / o is increased .",
    "the prime effect of an increased c / o ratio however is the same as an increased metallicity , namely that the atmospheric structure is changed such that the tio bands become stronger . only at a c / o ratio of 0.9 or higher ,",
    "the effect of a decreasing number of oxygen atoms available to form tio takes over , and the tio bands finally decrease in strength .",
    "we find from our models that a c / o ratio of 0.7 implies a temperature of m1347 increased by about 30k ( compared to , which in turn implies a f abundance _ increased _ by @xmath62dex ( see above ) .",
    "the effect on the atmosphere structure implies an f abundance _ decreased _ by @xmath62dex . in our cleaned list of hf lines , only the r19 line is blended with a weak cn line , but its effect on the f abundance measured from the r19 line is negligible .",
    "thus , the effects on the f abundance measurement of an increased c / o ratio ( via the temperature determination on the one hand and the changed atmosphere structure on the other hand ) effectively cancel out .",
    "the error due to the ( insecure ) continuum placement can be estimated from lines observed in both wavelength settings ; it amounts to @xmath63dex .",
    "finally , we include the statistical standard deviation of the f abundance derived from the individual lines of the cleaned list , which is @xmath64dex , again calculated on a linear scale .    converting the individual error items to a linear scale before summing in quadrature gives a total error of @xmath65dex . the use of a hydrostatic model atmosphere for a variable star may induce an additional systematic error which we can not estimate here .",

    "it is interesting to compare this inferred bulge fluorine abundance to predictions of galactic chemical evolution models .",
    "a semi - analytic multizone chemical evolution model of fluorine in the milky way has been presented by @xcite .",
    "the authors find satisfactory agreement between their model and the f abundance in solar neighborhood stars only if the contributions by wolf - rayet and agb stars are taken into account .",
    "the f abundance in @xmath4  cen giants however is well fit by f production in sne  ii alone . in a similar manner",
    ", our measurement of the f abundance in the bulge giant m1347 , which is in agreement with the solar abundance , suggests that wolf - rayet and agb stars also played a significant role in the chemical evolution of the galactic bulge .",
    "the formation of the bulge then must have lasted long enough that its chemical evolution could have been influenced by these stellar types .",
    "we thus conclude that wolf - rayet and agb stars contributed to the chemical evolution of the galactic bulge and disk on a very similar level .",
    "@xcite speculate that extra mixing processes ( cbp ) that connect the convective envelope to the h - burning shell might be the key to understand the high f abundances at a given c / o ratio as observed by @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of li in the bulge star analysed in the present study has been ascribed to the operation of cbp , too @xcite .",
    "however , the effect on cbp is rather that of decreasing the c / o ratio ( because of the transformation of c into n , see also section  [ errana ] ) than influencing the f abundance . if layers with temperatures exceeding some 30 million  k , also some f would be destroyed via @xmath1f(p,@xmath7)@xmath86o .",
    "it is not clear from current theoretical and observational studies if such high temperatures are involved in cbp an if destruction of f could indeed happen . also from our observations",
    "no clear conclusion in this respect can be drawn .",
    "for further details on the connection between cbp and the fluorine abundance we refer to @xcite .",
    "it would be of interest to compare the f abundance in bulge objects without signatures of internal nucleosynthesis ( e.g.  stars on the first giant branch ) to the f abundance derived in the present study . if the f abundance in such stars is found to be close to our result , a confirmation of the predictions of detailed nucleosynthesis calculations such as those of @xcite for low mass stars is suggested . with the advent of high - resolution ir",
    "spectrographs like crires such measurements have become readily feasible .    a deeper investigation of the nucleosynthetic origin of f is desired .",
    "we are currently devising a crires observing program aimed at determining the f abundance in high - mass agb stars of the magellanic clouds . in this respect",
    "the somewhat elaborate error analysis in section  [ errana ] is a useful and important exercise .",
    "the goal of these crires observation will be to observe the predicted up - turn of f production at masses , and the f _ destruction _ at masses around 5m@xmath6 and higher .",
    "important constraints on high - mass agb evolution and reaction rates involved in the synthesis of @xmath1f can be expected from these measurements .",
    "we particularly acknowledge r.  h.  tipping for providing his unpublished line list of the hf molecule .",
    "we also thank a.  jorissen for valuable comments on the manuscript .",
    "su and tl acknowledge funding by the austrian science fund fwf under the project p 18171-n02 , and ba acknowledges funding by the fwf under project p 19503-n13 .",
    "we want to thank the crires commissioning team for carrying out the observations of the bulge star analysed here ."
