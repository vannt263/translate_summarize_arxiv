    "many spiral galaxies , including our galaxy , have warped discs which resemble characteristic ` cosmic integral signs ' .",
    "that is , the outer disc lies above the inner disc plane on one side , and falls bellow that plane on the other side .",
    "although the warping is often seen in neutral hydrogen layers ( sancisi 1976 ; bosma 1981 ) , it is also observed in stellar discs ( van der kruit & searle 1981 ; innanen et al .  1982 ;",
    "sasaki 1987 ) . in the milky way , the stellar",
    "warp has been detected not only for young stars ( miyamoto , yoshizawa & suzuki 1988 ) but for old stars ( porcel , battaner & jimnez - vicente 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , the frequency of warped discs in spiral galaxies is sufficiently large that at least half of spirals are warped both in h i discs ( bosma 1991 ) and in optical discs ( snchez - saavedra , battaner & florido 1990 ; reshetnikov & combes 1998 ) .",
    "these observations imply that warps must persist for a long time unless they are repeatedly excited .",
    "it is true that some galaxies with warped discs ( e.g. , m31 , see innanen et al .",
    "1982 ) have nearby companions .",
    "however , there do exist warped galaxies ( e.g. , ngc 4565 , see sancisi 1976 ) that have no nearby companions being supposed to be responsible for the warp in the recent past .",
    "in fact , reshetnikov & combes ( 1998 ) have revealed that about 21 out of 133 isolated galaxies are warped like an integral sign .",
    "this indicates that warps are not necessarily caused by tidal interactions with other galaxies .",
    "one explanation for isolated warped galaxies is the gravitational torque of a halo acting on a disc that is ` misaligned ' to the equatorial plane of the halo .",
    "such a tilted disc embedded in a halo has intrinsic spin , so that it precesses like a top .",
    "since the precessing rate is a function of radius , kinematical warps will wind up and disperse in a short period of time .",
    "once the self - gravity of the disc is taken into account , realistic warped configurations emerge in which a disc precesses coherently like a solid body inside axisymmetric haloes ( sparke 1984 ; sparke & casertano 1988 , hereafter sc ; kuijken 1991 ) . even if a tilted disc is formed in a halo as a different shape from a warped mode ,",
    "it will be finally turned into the mode within a hubble time ( hofner & sparke 1994 ) . however , according to some numerical simulations ( dubinski & kuijken 1995 ; binney , jiang & dutta 1998 ) , the warping in oblate haloes is not retained persistently , and so , disappears within a few dynamical times .",
    "thus , the interaction between an oblate halo and a disc will be inappropriate for long - lasting warps .",
    "recently , smart et al .  (",
    "1998 ) have extracted warp - induced motions in the milky way by analysing the data obtained with the _ hipparcos _ satellite .",
    "then , they have found that the galactic warp rotates in the same direction as the galaxy .",
    "as shown by nelson & tremaine ( 1995 ) , oblate haloes lead to the opposite sense of the warp precession to the galactic rotation , whereas prolate haloes make them rotate in accordance with each other .",
    "in addition , they have demonstrated that in some cases , prolate haloes can excite warps .",
    "thus , prolate haloes are favourable to the explanation of smart et al.s ( 1998 ) finding , if the motions that they found are attributed to the interaction of the galactic disc with an often assumed massive halo .",
    "cosmological simulations , based on a cold dark matter scenario , have also revealed that dark matter haloes surrounding individual galaxies are highly triaxial and that the fraction of prolate haloes is roughly equal to that of oblate haloes ( dubinski & carlberg 1991 ) . in spite of these circumstances mentioned above , prolate haloes have somehow often been ignored in previous studies on warps .",
    "therefore , we need to pay attention to the warp arising from prolate haloes .    in this paper , we examine how a warp is developed and evolves in prolate haloes in comparison with that in oblate haloes . as a first step , we treat the haloes as external fixed potentials . in section 2",
    ", we describe the models and the numerical method .",
    "results are presented in section 3 . in section 4 , we analyse our results and explain them on the basis of a simplified model .",
    "conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "we study the evolution of self - gravitating discs embedded in axisymmetric haloes .",
    "as shown by nelson & tremaine ( 1995 ) and by dubinski & kuijken ( 1995 ) , dynamical friction between a disc and a halo plays an important role to precessing bending modes at least for the inner region of the composite system .",
    "however , the accurate evaluation of dynamical friction would require a prohibitively huge number of particles to represent the halo as well as the disc .",
    "otherwise , the disc will thicken owning to two - body relaxation originating from poisson fluctuations .",
    "in fact , dubinski & kuijken ( 1995 ) reported the vertical disc thickening for a self - consistent model with a particle disc , bulge , and halo . as a result",
    ", warped structures developed in the disc could not be distinguished from the background particle distribution , which would lead us to an incorrect conclusion about the longevity of the warp .",
    "then , we begin with rigid halo models , as a first step , to unravel the effects of the halo shape on the warp .",
    "the density distribution of the halo is an axisymmetric modification of hernquist s models ( hernquist 1990 ) being suitable for spherical galaxies and bulges .",
    "then , the halo density profile is represented , in cylindrical coordinates , by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the halo mass , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the radial and vertical core radii , respectively , and @xmath5 the cumulative mass profile and potential of the halo are written , respectively , by ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ^ 2},\\ ] ] where @xmath8    .parameters for @xmath0-body simulations . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : model ]    =    fig .  [",
    "fig : model ] presents the time evolution of the longitude and inclination of the outer ring , which corresponds to fig .",
    "[ fig : angle ] in the @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "we can see that the precession rate of the outer ring increases with decreasing inclination angle with respect to the equatorial plane of the halo , and vice versa .",
    "moreover , for the prolate halo the inclination angle decreases at the beginning , while for the oblate one it increases .",
    "thus , for the prolate halo , the precession of the outer ring can pass through that of the inner disc .",
    "after the passage , the inclination angle increases and the precession rate decreases .",
    "this means that the longitude of the inner disc and the outer ring remains almost aligned .",
    "therefore , the behaviour of the outer ring is the same as that seen in the @xmath0-body simulations . since we have found that the simple model can reproduce the main properties of the @xmath0-body simulations , we can rely on this model to figure out the physical mechanism of warps in the oblate and prolate haloes as described below .",
    "the precession of the outer ring is caused by the torque due to the halo and the inner disc .",
    "we take a coordinate system in which the @xmath9-axis is along the symmetry axis of the halo , and the @xmath10-axis is along the line of nodes of the outer ring ( where the outer ring intersects with the @xmath11 plane ) .",
    "the @xmath12-plane is in the inertial frame .",
    "the geometry is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo ] .",
    "= 0.8    the @xmath10-component of the torque exerted by the halo on the outer ring is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the line density of the outer ring , and @xmath15 is the mass of the outer ring .",
    "the @xmath16- and @xmath9-components , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , of the force due to the halo per unit mass are , respectively , written by @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the halo contributions of the orbital and vertical frequencies , respectively .",
    "the position vector of a point on the outer ring is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the inclination angle of the outer ring with respect to the equatorial plane of the halo .",
    "then , on the assumption that @xmath20 and @xmath21 are constant on the ring , we obtain @xmath24 the potential of an exponential disc in the outer region is approximated as [ see equation ( 2p-5 ) of binney & tremain ( 1987 ) ] , @xmath25.\\ ] ] thus , the @xmath16- and @xmath9-components of the force due to the inner disc per unit mass are , respectively , given by @xmath26,\\ ] ] and @xmath27.\\ ] ] provided that the line of nodes with respect to the equatorial plane of the halo is aligned between the inner disc and the outer ring , the @xmath10-component of the torque exerted by the inner disc is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the inclination angle of the outer ring relative to the inner disc plane , and its sign is positive when the inclination angle of the inner disc is larger than that of the outer ring , and vice versa .",
    "next , the absolute value of the total angular momentum of the outer ring , @xmath30 , is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the orbital frequency , if the precession rate is rather smaller than the orbital frequency .",
    "the perpendicular component to the @xmath9-axis is @xmath33 .",
    "the change in @xmath34 over an infinitesimally small time @xmath35 is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the precession rate of the outer ring .",
    "thus , @xmath38 this should be equal to the torque on the outer ring , so that the precession rate is derived as @xmath39    if the warp is of the type i shape such as fig .  [",
    "fig : pic]a , @xmath23 is nearly equal to @xmath29 .",
    "it follows from equation ( [ eq : pre ] ) that the precession rate is proportional to @xmath40 . in this case , the second term of equation ( [ eq : pre ] ) is negative because @xmath29 is positive , and the first term is also negative because @xmath41 for the oblate halo .",
    "therefore , the precession rate increases with increasing inclination as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle ] , and the difference in longitude between the outer ring and the inner disc becomes larger with time . if the warped disc is of the type ii shape such as fig .",
    "[ fig : pic]b , @xmath29 is negative . taking into consideration @xmath42 for the prolate halo , both terms in equation ( [ eq : pre ] ) are positive .",
    "moreover , @xmath23 will become smaller than @xmath43 with decreasing inclination , so that the second term of equation ( [ eq : pre ] ) is dominant .",
    "therefore , the precession rate increases with decreasing inclination , and vice versa as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle ] .",
    "the time evolution of the inclination is also explained simply by the torque on the outer ring .",
    "the geometry is the same as that used in the previous subsection except that the @xmath12-plane is in the precessing frame of the outer ring .",
    "the @xmath16-component of the torque , @xmath44 , changes that of the angular momentum , @xmath45 , and so , affects the inclination angle , @xmath23 . at the beginning",
    ", @xmath46 suffers no change from the torque due to the halo because of the axisymmetric nature of the halo .",
    "if the longitude of the outer ring is the same as that of the inner disc , we obtain @xmath47 , and so , the inclination remains unchanged .",
    "if the longitude of the outer ring is smaller than that of the inner disc , i.e. , a warp like a trailing spiral , @xmath44 becomes positive .",
    "hence , @xmath46 increases , so that the inclination angle of the outer ring decreases .",
    "since the torque on the inner disc is the opposite direction to that of the outer ring according to newton s third law , the inclination of the inner disc increases . as a result ,",
    "the type ii warp is generated .",
    "similarly , a warp like a leading spiral leads to the type i warp .",
    "if the precession rate in the prolate halo decreases with radius , the warped configuration becomes similar to a trailing spiral because the sense of the precession is the same direction as the disc rotation .",
    "consequently , the type ii warp is produced , which leads to the situation where the inclination of the outer ring decreases , and the precession rate increases . in the subsequent evolution",
    ", the longitude of the outer ring passes through that of the inner disc . at the point",
    ", the warped configuration turns into that similar to a leading spiral , which , this time , leads to the situation where the inclination increases and the precession rate decreases .",
    "this kind of self - regulation enables the warped disc to avoid the differential precession . for the oblate halo",
    ", however , once the precession of the outer ring recedes from that of the inner disc , the difference in precession rate continues to increase , so that the warp winds up tightly .",
    "our oblate halo model can not sustain the warped disc , though sc found that long - lived warps do exist in some halo models .",
    "this discrepancy is considered to originate from the radial extent of a disc .",
    "sc showed that a discrete mode with an eigenfrequency @xmath48 may exist only if @xmath49 is satisfied at the edge of the disc , where @xmath32 and @xmath50 are the orbital and vertical frequencies , respectively .",
    "for oblate haloes , @xmath51 and @xmath48 are negative .",
    "since @xmath51 tends to zero with radius , there is some radius where @xmath48 is equal to @xmath51 .",
    "beyond such a radius , the condition of the existence of discrete modes is violated . according to sc ,",
    "bending modes become continuous in frequency @xmath48 , if a warped disc embedded in an oblate halo extends beyond the radius at which @xmath52 holds . consequently",
    ", such continuous modes will be propagated with a group velocity and disappear ( hunter & toomre 1969 ) . as is found from fig .",
    "[ fig : omega]a , such a resonance radius emerges at @xmath53 in our oblate halo model .",
    "this implies that there would be no discrete bending mode and that a warped configuration would be coerced to disperse .",
    "thus , the disappearance of the warping for the oblate halo could be due to the existence of the resonance .",
    "on the other hand , in our prolate halo model , the condition of @xmath54 is exactly satisfied within the truncated radius , 15 @xmath55 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : omega]b .",
    "therefore , a discrete mode can exist in our prolate halo model .",
    "= 0.8    our adopted disc model is nothing special in the sense that the observed light distributions of galactic discs are well - described by an exponential law , though a constant mass - to - luminosity ratio throughout the disc is assumed .",
    "our simulations suggest that as long as a disc is not truncated abruptly , real galactic discs would not have a discrete bending mode if surrounding haloes are oblate .",
    "in this paper , we have examined the time evolution of warped discs in the oblate and prolate haloes using @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "the haloes were represented by fixed external potentials in which self - gravitating discs were embedded .",
    "then , we have found the warped configurations both in the oblate and prolate haloes . while the warping in the oblate halo continued to wind up with time and finally disappeared , the warping in the prolate halo survived to the end of the simulation by regulating the line of nodes of the warped disc to be straight .",
    "we have shown that this difference in winding between the oblate and prolate haloes can be attributed to the gravitational torque between the inner and outer discs .",
    "observationally , some galaxies show the straight line of nodes of the warp within the holmberg radius , beyond which the warp is traced as a leading spiral ( briggs 1990 ) .",
    "others show that the line of nodes is delineated as a trailing spiral ( christodoulou , tohline , steiman - cameron 1988 ; bosma 1991 ) .",
    "these observations appear to favour the view that we just witness the different phases of the evolving warped discs in prolate haloes , because only warped discs in prolate haloes can change the spirality of the line of nodes according to our simulations .",
    "putting together our simulations and the observations mentioned above , we can infer that warps are formed and maintained in prolate haloes . however , our fixed halo models are quite simplified",
    ". in particular , such models can not include the effect of dynamical friction between the warped disc and the halo .",
    "dubinski & kuijken ( 1995 ) and nelson & tremaine ( 1995 ) have shown that dynamical friction plays an important role to precessing discs .",
    "therefore , we will need the simulations of warped discs embedded in live haloes to determine the precise evolution of warps , though a huge number of particles will be required to incorporate the effect of dynamical friction accurately into such simulations , and to avoid disc heating due to an insufficient number of halo particles .",
