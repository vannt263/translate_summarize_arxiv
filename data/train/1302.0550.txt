    "as a family of promising candidates for spintronics application , half - metallic ( hm ) magnetic materials have attracted much interest over the past two decades@xcite . de groot _",
    "et al._@xcite discovered hms computationally and popularized the hm possibility especially in heusler and half - heusler compounds .",
    "the distinguishing characteristic of a hm is that at the mean field level the fermi level for one spin direction falls within a gap for the other direction , resulting in 100% polarized conduction and obvious spintronics applications .",
    "motivated by the unusual magneto - optical properties , the heusler class of intermetallic materials provided the most promising realizations of hm character .",
    "thermal fluctuations degrade spin alignment and thus destroy the ideal hm .",
    "in addition , real materials effects such as crystal imperfections can couple spins and degrade the polarization ; spin - orbit coupling destroys the true hm . these phenomena can be minor at low temperatures compared with the curie temperature ( which ranges 500 - 730 k in the half heusler family nimnz ( z = co , pd , pt , sb )  [ ] and can be higher ) , but because proposed applications do not rely on 100% polarization , hms remain viable for near - future electronic devices .",
    "a variety of experimental techniques , including positron annihilation , spin - resolved photoemission spectroscopy , andreev reflection , and nuclear magnetic resonance , have been employed to assess the character and polarization level of proposed hms , often with less than definitive results .",
    "comparision is made with density functional theory ( dft ) based electronic structure calculations , which still play the dominant role in the specification of hms and in the search for additional hms and for the even more exotic half metallic antiferromagnets@xcite .",
    "hmafs , better characterized as compensated hms , have zero macroscopic moment so they can provide additional functionalities . known or strongly anticipated hms now span a diverse collection of materials with different chemical and physical properties .    an important question about hms ,",
    "not yet well clarified , is the impact of dynamic interactions ( which lie beyond dft methods ) on the character and the survival of the single - spin - channel gap that defines the hm phase .",
    "one of the most fundamental consequences of repulsive on - site interactions is local moment formation and dynamics , the study of whose effects in metals has a long history ( anderson impurities , kondo systems ) .",
    "local moments in insulators are also rather well studied and present a largely distinct set of issues ( gap states versus band resonances , magnetic activity)@xcite .",
    "hms , especially in oxides , bring in all of these issues : although one spin is gapped , it is not electrically an insulator since there is metallic screening , but the two spin channels are fundamentally distinct .",
    "there have now been a number of studies , in particular by katsnelson , chioncel , and collaborators , that indicate degradation of the hm gap  sometimes severely  by electron - electron interactions .",
    "one general picture is that interactions , typically pictured in terms of a magnetic polaron formed by charge carrier - magnon binding , lead to tailing of spectral density into the gap and sometimes to mid - gap states that would substantially degrade performance as a hm device component .",
    "another issue , not explicitly addressed to any great extent in treatments of interactions , is the distinction between the two types of hms .",
    "the study of the fully polarized ferromagnet , also referred to as a saturated ferromagnet , in which the minority spin states are empty , extends back to the seminal work of edwards and hertz.@xcite cro@xmath2 is the simplest example of this : high spin s=1 cr@xmath3 has no occupied minority states@xcite .",
    "the `` gap '' in cro@xmath2 is several ev wide , between occupied o @xmath4 states and the unoccupied minority @xmath5 bands . for low energy considerations , dc transport for example , minority spin states are out of the picture .",
    "the more common hm involves @xmath6 states on either side of the gap as well as the continuum in the metallic channel ; the minority charge excitations are typically narrowly gapped ; in intermetallics a commonly ooccurring value is @xmath70.5 ev and even in oxides is rarely much greater . in the saturated case",
    ", there are simply no minority charge excitations to consider .",
    "there have been several studies based on model hamiltonians  @xcite . in particular , work based on the @xmath8-@xmath6 exchange model",
    "predicted the existence of nonquasiparticle ( nqp ) density of states near the fermi level , which ( mathematically ) arise from the branch cut of the self - energy arising from electron - magnon interactions  @xcite .",
    "chioncel _ et.al .",
    "_  illustrated the coincidence between nqp states and the imaginary part of local spin - flip susceptibility in the framework of the single - band hubbard hamiltonian and dmft approach ( see below ) where saturated ferromagnetism is stabilized by the additional magnetic spin splitting mimicking the local hund rule  @xcite .",
    "an effective spin hamiltonian was derived to account for the temperature and disorder dependence of the magnetic properties of half - metallic double perovskites  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , kondo screening was recently shown to stabilize ferromagnetic order and further result in a half metallic phase with minority - spin gap in the kondo lattice model with antiferromagnetic coupling  @xcite .",
    "the lda+dmft ( local density approximation plus dynamical mean - field theory ) approach that is becoming widely used to treat strong interactions is not based on a model hamiltonian , instead using lda results as the non - interacting system together with a self - interaction correction .",
    "this approach has been applied by chioncel and coworkers@xcite to evaluate the effect of interactions on hms .",
    "one of the most well studied intermetallic hms , nimnsb,@xcite was the first application of this combined technique.@xcite the calculated spectral density contained non - quasiparticle ( nqp ) states within the minority gap , but above , rather than pinned to , the fermi level , allowing it to survive as a hm .",
    "however , further investigations of nimnsb and other heusler alloys show that the magnetic moment per formula unit , the nqp spectral weight , and the total dos are insensitive or only weakly sensitive@xcite to correlation effects . in striking contrast",
    ", correlation effects were found to play a vital role in zincblende vas , which is calculated to be a ferromagnetic semiconductor ( _ i.e. _ gapped in _ both _ spin channels ) within lsda or the generalized gradient approximation gga , but predicted to be a half - metal ferromagnet due to band shifts produced by lsda+dmft.@xcite strong correlation effects are also obtained in magnetite , which is uncommon in hms in having a majority - spin gap.@xcite in the full heusler compound mn@xmath2val which is hm within lsda,@xcite an lsda+dmft treatment of local interaction led to nqp states within the gap but below the fermi level,@xcite which would not degrade spintronics - related properties . at present",
    "the impact of interactions appears to be highly material specific .",
    "however , the models and the treatment of the interactions ( always approximate in some way ) has varied widely , so few questions are truly settled .",
    "the dmft approach , which treats on - site interactions and dynamics in detail , has the shortcoming of neglecting intersite correlations .",
    "hence spinwaves , or even short range spin order , that still contain strong correlations between neighbors , are replaced by identical but uncorrelated spin fluctuations on each interacting site .",
    "it is unclear to what degree the misrepresentation of these excitations may affect the character of the interacting spectral density .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the survival ( or not ) and character of hm phases based on a bilayer hubbard model with unequal interlayer hopping for the two spin species .",
    "this model allows a substantial parameter range in which the non - interacting density of states ( dos ) has a gap in only one spin channel , and will be described in detail in the next section .",
    "we note here that the layer index can be regarded equivalently as an orbital or band index , so that the bilayer hubbard hamiltonian provides a useful pedagogical link between single orbital and multiorbital models .    in the case when the spin up and spin down band structures are identical ( i.e.  in the absence of underlying magnetic order ) , tuning of the interlayer hybridization in such bilayer models has been demonstrated to drive a variety of quantum phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "for example , at half filling , the ground state can have antiferromagnetic long - range order for small interlayer ( interband ) hopping @xmath9 , and enter a disordered valence bond phase with singlet correlations between electrons on two layers , for large @xmath9 .",
    "likewise , the system can evolve through mott insulating transitions@xcite as @xmath9 is altered . in the doped system , there is a topological reconstruction of the fermi surface , which modifies the spin fluctuations and changes the superconducting gap symmetry @xcite . adopting spin - asymmetric interlayer hopping , our model introduces new avenues of behavior to be illuminated .",
    "previous studies of hms in the single - band hubbard model focused@xcite mostly on the limiting case of saturated ferromagnetism achieved through an external zeeman magnetic field @xmath10 . with the underlying up and down spin bands being degenerate , the effective spin chemical potentials @xmath11 are chosen to depopulate one of the species .",
    "an alternate way to achieve a half - metal , one in which the two spins species can still have the same population so that the polarization is zero , is to alter the band structure so that a gap opens for just one of the species ( which we will choose to be the  down \" spins ) .",
    "for example , in a one band tight - binding model on a bipartite lattice with band @xmath12 , one can incorporate an additional staggered potential @xmath13 , where the @xmath14 has opposite sign on the two sublattices .",
    "this alternating potential mixes momentum states @xmath15 and @xmath16 and opens up a gap in the dispersion relation @xmath17 . by choosing @xmath18 and @xmath19 , for an appropriate choice of fermi level",
    ", the down spin species is insulating while the up species is metallic .",
    "such a staggered potential , however , couples strongly to antiferromagnetism since it provides a one body energy which favors an oscillating down spin density on the two sublattices .",
    "the dominant nature of the resulting magnetic response might obscure the determination of the effect of @xmath0 on the transport properties .",
    "for example , for a half - filled square lattice hubbard model which has a divergent antiferromagnetic susceptibility @xmath20 , the additional staggered potential immediately produces a state with long range antiferromagnetic order ( lrafo ) which is ` trivial ' in the sense that it does not arise from a spontaneous breaking of symmetry , but rather from the externally imposed potential .",
    "this lrafo opens a slater gap in the initially metallic up spin spectrum , so that @xmath0 immediately , but in some sense trivially , destroys hm behavior .",
    "we avoid this confusing aspect by considering instead the slightly more complex case of a two layer ( or , equivalently , two orbital ) square lattice hubbard model with spin - dependent inter - layer ( inter - orbital ) hopping , @xmath21 here the additional index @xmath22 labels two layers ( orbitals ) while @xmath23 are site indices and @xmath24 is the spin .",
    "the first term is an intralayer nearest - neighbor hopping .",
    "we consider a square lattice with intralayer hopping @xmath25 to set the energy scale .",
    "@xmath26 is a spin - dependent interlayer ( interorbital ) hybridization , and @xmath0 is an on - site repulsion .",
    "the terms coupling to the density are a spin - independent chemical potential @xmath27 and a zeeman field @xmath10 .",
    "the repulsive on - site interaction term is written in particle - hole symmetric ( phs ) form so that at @xmath28 the system is half - filled ( for each spin species ) , even if @xmath29 .",
    "the noninteracting limit @xmath30 has two bands for each spin , @xmath31 for @xmath32 these two bands overlap , yielding metallic behavior .",
    "however , for @xmath33 , eq .  [ nonintbands ] characterizes a band insulator with gap @xmath34 .",
    "this hamiltonian , and choice of @xmath30 band stucture , represents a half - metal without polarization , and avoids the externally imposed antiferromagnetism which would arise from a staggered potential .",
    "the price paid is the introduction of the extra layer ( orbital ) degree of freedom @xmath35 .",
    "the hubbard hamiltonian on a diamond chain is a one dimensional analog in which the interplay of perpendicular hopping and @xmath0 can create a correlation - induced half metal for certain fillings@xcite .",
    "the manner in which magnetic order ( a fundamental necessity for a hm ) is built into the model may affect behavior . in our model ,",
    "magnetic order is implicit in the spin - dependence of @xmath36 but is otherwise unspecified .",
    "a signature aspect of our model is that for u=0 it is a specific realization of the schematic symmetric hmaf dos , presented for example in fig .  1 of ref .",
    "[ ] . in their dmft study of a fully polarized bethe lattice hubbard model , chioncel _ et.al . _ used a zeeman field to mimic hund s rule coupling , thereby splitting the two spin directions until the minority band was empty.@xcite in lsda+dmft studies of suspected hm materials ( nimnas , femnsb , vas ) , chioncel and coworkers@xcite based their dynamical corrections on the spin - split lsda bands .",
    "the goal of this paper is to determine the effect of the electronic correlation term @xmath0 in the model hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ h ] . specifically , we compute the spin - resolved spectral densities as functions of @xmath37 , and temperature @xmath38 .",
    "we also study the interplay of @xmath0 and interlayer hopping @xmath36 on the antiferromagnetic correlations . for simplicity we will set @xmath39 and vary @xmath40 so that spin up fermions are metallic and the spin down",
    "fermions can be tuned from metal to band insulator at @xmath41 .    at the phs point",
    "@xmath28 , both spin species are half - filled ( regardless of the values of @xmath42 or temperature @xmath38 ) .",
    "this immediately implies the polarization is identically zero , so that our model system realizes the exotic half - metallic antiferromagnetism ( hmaf )  @xcite .",
    "although there has been to date no clear confirmation of novel hmaf materials , a variety of candidates have been proposed , including la@xmath2vcuo@xmath43@xcite as a likely member of the double perovskite system with two magnetic ions,@xcite semiconductors doped with dilute magnetic ions,@xcite and monolayer superlattices crs / fes and vs / cos@xcite .",
    "an unusual semi - dirac half - semimetal arises in untrathin vo@xmath2 films@xcite .",
    "our model s bands closely resemble the simplest realization of a hmaf as arising from two exchange - split ions that are antialigned , shown schematically and discussed in ref . [ ] . after considering the fundamental phs case",
    ", we will also present some results for non - zero zeeman field @xmath10 , where the system can be expected to acquire nonzero polarization .",
    "we treat the interaction using the determinant quantum monte carlo ( dqmc ) technique@xcite .",
    "dqmc is a numerically exact approach to solve interacting tight binding electron hamiltonians like eq .",
    "[ h ] . in comparison with dmft",
    ", dqmc has the advantage of being able easily to incorporate and measure magnetic , charge , and pairing correlations between different spatial sites . on the other hand",
    ", dqmc has the drawback of being formulated on finite spatial lattices so that finite size effects must be assessed .",
    "dqmc also is limited by the fermion `` sign problem''@xcite ( much more so than single site dmft ) which prevents the acquisition of data at low temperatures .",
    "most of the results presented in this paper will be for two @xmath44 layers and inverse temperatures @xmath45 .",
    "we will show that the sign problem is somewhat alleviated for zeeman field @xmath46 so that lower temperatures can be reached .      in order to distinguish metal from insulator , and see the effect of @xmath0 on the half - metallicity , we will examine the single - particle density of states , @xmath47 .",
    "this quantity is obtained by an analytic continuation of the local imaginary - time dependent green s function @xmath48 , that is , by inverting , @xmath49 using the maximum entropy method@xcite .",
    "our focus will be on the density of states at the fermi surface @xmath50 to see if hm behavior survives at non - zero @xmath0 .",
    "although the system has no net polarizaton at @xmath51 from the viewpoint of _ total _ up and down occupations , the distinction between spin directions induces a polarization of the _ conduction _ electrons , which is quantified by , @xmath52 this quantity has been the focus of much experimental work , since hms ( at t=0 ) have 100% polarization which is what makes them so attractive for spintronics applications .",
    "we also study the dc electrical conductivity @xmath53 , which is extracted from the current - current correlation function , @xmath54 where @xmath55 . the conductivity is obtained using the approximate form of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem@xcite , valid at large @xmath56 , @xmath57    the magnetic magnetic structure factor @xmath58 is of interest as well . in the ordered phase the spin correlations @xmath59 are non - zero for large @xmath60 and @xmath61 grows linearly with the lattice size @xmath62 at the appropriate ordering wave vector @xmath63 .",
    "most hm magnets investigated to date are at most moderately correlated intermetallic compounds@xcite and dft treatments may be quite realistic .",
    "for instance , photoemission experiments and resonant x - ray scattering has led to the estimate of hubbard interaction @xmath64 ev for nimnsb  @xcite , while a wannier orbital analysis has shown that the bandwidth of the nimnsb bands crossing @xmath65 is @xmath66 4 ev . the ratio @xmath67 puts this hm compound in the weakly to moderately correlated regime . in our model system ,",
    "the non - interacting bandwidth is @xmath68 at @xmath69 , which suggests @xmath70 is the relevant range to study .",
    "correlation effects of this size can fundamentally change the physics of related tight - binding hamiltonians , _",
    "e.g. _ opening a correlation gap or inducing aflro and a slater gap ; see for example ref . [ ] and references therein .",
    "the near - neighbor square lattice tight binding model is unstable to arbitrarily small @xmath0 , although this sensitivity is a result of the van hove singularity ( vhs ) and perfect nesting of that model .",
    "the majority channel in our model however retains these same features ( at @xmath71 only , of course ) ; in the minority channel the vhs are shifted to either side of @xmath27=0 .",
    "even with one remaining vhs , we will show below that interactions play a much less dramatic role when one spin channel is gapped .",
    "there is , after all , new physics in a hm as well as the new phenomena discussed in sec .",
    "i : the new energy scale that is given by the spin - down gap @xmath72 .",
    "down - spin charge excitations are gapped by @xmath73 , which make interactions further differentiate the spins , for example by enabling sharp ` impurity ' states ( only ) within the spin - down gap .",
    "spin - flip interactions are gapped by the separation between @xmath27 ( the up - spin fermi level ) and the nearest down - spin band edge , which is @xmath74 at @xmath27=0 in our model .",
    "kondo processes vanish due to the absence of low energy spin - flip excitations .",
    "perhaps more relevantly , the vhs- and nesting - driven spin density wave instability obviously will be quenched when there is a minority gap .",
    "we show it is also suppressed in the ferromagnetic metal phase where the minority bands are split but not gapped .",
    "the moderating of strong interation effects is seen in the density of states , shown in fig .",

    "the gap magnitude and tailing of states into the gap is unaltered up to u=4 .",
    "the up ( metallic ) species @xmath80 is also constant from @xmath81 to @xmath76 to within the accuracy of the maximum entropy inversion of eq .",
    "the peaks in @xmath82 away from @xmath83 are affected by the finite size effect of the @xmath44 lattice .",
    "one distinguishing characteristic of interactions in hms extensively discussed in previous studies is the appearance of the non - quasiparticle ( nqp ) states within the spectral gap  the magnetic polaron effect .",
    "these nqp states in previous studies have ( 1 ) appeared , at @xmath83 , above @xmath83 , and below @xmath83 , and ( 2 ) also possibly not appeared . in the generic picture , the density of nqp states vanishes at the fermi level ( @xmath83 ) but increases toward an energy scale of the order of the magnon frequency , leading to an asymmetry of spectral function .",
    "@xcite assisted perhaps by the particle - hole symmetry in our model ( implying the symmetry of spectral function ) at half filling , nqp states may be inhibited from appearing , and there is no signature of nqp states in fig .",
    "[ dosb5tup0tdn5 ] .",
    "the implicit nature of magnetic order in our model may also play a role , but other treatments have also incorporated some implicit origin of the magnetic order in a hm .",
    "the hm character can be expected to become more or less evident in a property specific manner , and we now describe a few examples .",
    "the relatively minor effect of on - site interaction @xmath0 is further evidenced by the behavior of the dc - conductivity in fig .",
    "[ condb6 ] , where the interlayer coupling is varied to move the system through the metallic phase @xmath40=2 ,  3 , through the transition @xmath40=4 , to the hm phase @xmath40=5 . at @xmath40=2 the conductivity is u - dependent because @xmath84 in the metallic phase has the underlying van hove singularity there .",
    "as u increases the @xmath40 dependence weakens , and at @xmath40=4 and 5 , which is crossing over into the hm phase , @xmath85 decreases and becomes independent of the interaction strength : in the hm phase @xmath86 , @xmath53 falls by less than ten percent as @xmath0 increases from @xmath87 to @xmath88 , and must be controlled solely by spin - up processes .",
    "[ safb6tup0 ] demonstrates the correlation effects on the staggered magnetic static structure factor , again for the progression from metal to hm @xmath40=2 - 5 .",
    "the increase with u at small interlayer coupling decreases as the hm phase is approached and entered , and the variation of @xmath89 with u in the hm phase @xmath90 is quite small .",
    "it is unlikely that antiferromagnetic long - range order will arise at lower temperatures , and it is known that , in the case of spin - independent interlayer hybridization , @xmath9 drives a competing singlet ground state , with a quantum critical point at @xmath91 above which the ground state of the bilayer model no longer has aflro in its ground state .    in summary , our simple bilayer model of an unpolarized hm indicates the robustness of the hm phase to interactions .",
    "this is consistent with some previous work , which concludes that the half - metallic properties of several materials such as nimnsb and other heusler alloys are insensitive or only weakly sensitive to correlation effects  @xcite .",
    "it is not apparent whether the explicit particle - hole symmetry at half filling and implicit nature of magnetic order in our model has any substantial effect , but whatever the reason there is no signature here associated with the states in the gap .",
    "the temperature dependence of the half - metallic properties and their stability against finite - temperature spin excitations are crucial for practical applications . as mentioned before ,",
    "one crucial effect is the depolarization caused by finite - temperature . with the separate spin bands fixed in our model , the effect of reduced magnetization upon approaching the curie temperature is not included , but we can study temperature effects `` at fixed magnetization . ''",
    "[ dostup0tdn5u3vst ] illustrates the temperature effects on the density of states in the half - metallic phase .",

    "a separate diagnostic of the nature of half - metallic phase and its robustness against the hubbard interaction @xmath0 is provided by the conductivity , fig .",
    "[ condvst ] , evaluated from eq .",
    "recall that in a half metal for these values of parameters , the conductivity arises only from the majority ( ungapped ) channel , and spin - flip scattering is frozen out at these temperatures leaving scattering only in the charge channel .",
    "this data supports the previous indications of the relatively small effects of interactions in our bilayer model of a half metal .",
    "the primary difference for @xmath64 is the significantly larger conductivity when @xmath38 falls below @xmath102 , compared to the @xmath103 trajectory . on the other hand , @xmath85 at higher temperatures hardly depends on @xmath0 .",

    "does not cross either gap edge , there is no reoccupation of states of either spin .",
    "in fact there is no change ( up to a constant ) in the real - space potential for either spin , so the ( many - body ) states themselves do not change .",

    "[ magnetic ] were obtained at constant @xmath27 , and the b - induced increase in density has be recognized but does not affect this picture .",
    "we have used the numerically exact finite - temperature determinant quantum monte carlo ( dqmc ) method to study the effect of strong interaction induced correlations on half - metallic behavior in a multiband hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "our model consists of a bilayer square lattice , or , alternately viewed , a two orbital system , with spin - dependent interlayer hybridization chosen to induce a band gap in only one spin species .",
    "this is a model appropriate to half metallic antiferromagnets , since the lattice has the same number of spin up and spin down electrons , but only the latter have a gapped non - interacting spectrum .    by investigating the influence of an on - site hubbard interaction @xmath0 , finite temperature @xmath38 and external zeeman magnetic field @xmath10",
    ", we find that the half - metallic properties are not particularly sensitive to the interaction @xmath0 , up to values equal to about half the bandwidth which seem appropriate to intermetallic half metals .",
    "finite - temperature effects depolarize the conduction electron states only at @xmath123 of the gap , with a degree of depolarization which depends weakly on @xmath0 .",
    "a very large zeeman magnetic field drives the system ( at fixed particle number ) from half metal to metallic ferromagnet , and finally to a ferromagnetic insulating phase when the minority spectral density is zeeman split completely above the majority spectrum .",
    "an interesting issue in half - metallic ferromagnetic materials that remains undecided is when non - quasiparticle ( nqp ) states arising from electron - magnon interaction arise , and whether they are above , below , or spanning the chemical potential .",
    "the signature of such states is the appearance of a resonance in the gapped channel .",
    "in contrast to several earlier studies based on different models and using a different treatment of the interaction , we have not seen any distinct characteristic features associated with nqp states in the dqmc studies of our model . the difference may be related to the fact that our bilayer system without the external magnetic field satisfies particle - hole symmetry so that @xmath124 is always pinned to the center of the gap .",
    "the other possibility is that the sign problem has prevented us from reaching low enough temperature to observe the development of the resonance , or that the spin waves that may be required for a proper description of electron - magnon interactions are not yet fully formed .",
    "it is possible that the effects of interactions are simply model and material dependent rather than universal .",
