    "high redshift radio galaxies ( hzrgs ) have significantly contributed to our understanding of the formation of galaxies and their environments @xcite . unlike quasars , the light from hzrgs",
    "is not dominated by the ( non - stellar ) agn component but is spatially resolved , allowing us to get a clearer view of the host galaxy and its young stellar population , using hst and keck . a dramatic example of",
    "this is the recent discovery of jet - induced star formation in the hzrg 4c41.17 at @xmath8 @xcite , and the discovery of fully formed hzrg ellipticals at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the number of known hzrgs dramatically decreases at high redshift ( figure 1 ) . at present , 120 radio galaxies are known with @xmath10 2 , of which 16 have @xmath11 3 and only 3 have @xmath11 4 .",
    "determining redshifts of large numbers of radio sources is very demanding in telescope time .",
    "samples of optically faint radio sources therefore have to be limited , thereby unavoidably introducing selection effects .",
    "to obtain significant samples of hzrgs , two main strategies have been used in the past : ( i ) surveys of a restricted part of the sky using a low flux density cut - off ; ( ii ) all - sky surveys with a radio spectral index or radio-`colour ' bias .",
    "the first major search for hzrgs was the 3cr survey , which now has complete redshift information @xcite .",
    "this survey is biased as it only includes sources of extreme radio power ( s@xmath12 10 jy ) , imposing a tight redshift - power relation , which makes it difficult to disentangle redshift and power dependence ( best , rawlings , these proceedings ) .",
    "a southern equivalent to this 3cr survey , but 10 times deeper , is the molonglo reference catalog/1 jy",
    "survey @xcite . in finding very high redshift radio galaxies",
    ", the mrc/1jy is not efficient , as @xmath13 of the galaxies are at @xmath11 3 . a similar survey",
    ", the 6c / b2 is being undertaken in the northern hemisphere ( rawlings , these proceedings ; eales , 1997 )    more effective searches for hzrgs have been made using with samples of ultra steep spectrum ( uss ; @xmath14 ) radio sources covering a large sky area .",
    "several samples of uss sources @xcite have led to the discovery of more than 70 @xmath15 radio galaxies , more than half of the 120 known today .",
    "figure 1 shows the contribution of uss selected sources ( shaded ) to the total number of @xmath15 hzrgs .",
    "all the highest redshift radio galaxies ( @xmath16 ) have been found using uss criteria .",
    "with the advent of the wenss , nvss and first surveys it is now possible for the first time to define a uniformly selected sample of uss sources covering the entire sky north of declination @xmath540 , and using 10  100 times lower flux density limits than has been possible before .      a correlation of 1997 march versions of the wenss and nvss catalogues provided spectral indices for 78,000 sources , of which we selected the 1% with spectral indices @xmath17 .",
    "several additional cut - offs were applied to the sample : ( i ) s@xmath18 mjy , to obtain a complete sample with spectral indices accurate to 0.1 ; ( ii ) galactic latitude @xmath19 15 , to avoid excessive galactic extinction during optical imaging and spectroscopy ; and ( iii ) only unresolved sources in the wenss survey ( resolution 54 ) were retained . unlike some other uss samples ( the 6c@xmath20 ; rawlings , these proceedings ) , we did not apply other size cut - offs , as hzrgs exist with angular sizes of 30or more ( our sample contains for example a @xmath21 galaxy of 35 ; bremer , these proceedings ) .",
    "the present wn sample consists of 284 uss sources .",
    "the wenss survey covers the northern quarter of the sky . in order to extend our samples to the southern hemisphere , while still maintaining uniform sample , we correlated the texas 365 mhz survey @xcite with the nvss .",
    "next to the same cut - offs as in the wn sample , we have also excluded sources of questionable fluxes or positions from the texas catalogue @xcite . because we are including texas sources down to the flux limit",
    ", the tn sample will only be @xmath22 complete at s@xmath23 = 250 mjy . as a result",
    ", the tn sample goes 4 times less deep than the wn sample . in the area covered by both wenss and texas , we therefore preferred the wenss fluxes .",
    "our tn sample covers @xmath24@xmath25 28 .",
    "we estimated the errors in the tn spectral indices by comparing them with the wn spectral indices in the overlapping region .",
    "we found that there is no systematic difference between tn and wn spectral indices as a function of wenss flux density .",
    "positional uncertainties of nvss sources become larger as flux decreases ( condon , these proceedings ) . as we are reaching flux levels where these errors become @xmath26 , and virtually all our objects are fainter than @xmath27",
    ", the nvss position accuracy is inadequate for optical identifications .",
    "we therefore correlated our wn sample with the first catalogue @xcite which has accurate positions , and provides a check of the 1.4 ghz flux density , allowing us to weed out variable sources .",
    "unfortunately , the present coverage of the first survey overlaps with only 25% of our wn / tn samples .",
    "we therefore observed 239 sources in our sample outside the first area with the vla in a and bna arrays .",
    "observations were done at 4.8 ghz to increase the resolution relative to the first survey and to identify spectral curvature .",
    "the first year of spectroscopic observations of our sample using 3 @xmath5 4 m class telescopes has yielded firm redshifts for 27 sources .",
    "the median redshift is @xmath28 ; only 8 have @xmath29 , while 15 have @xmath30 , 3 have @xmath31 , and 1 recently discovered has @xmath32 . for almost 40%",
    "of the sources observed , we could not yet determine the redshift because either no object or no emission lines were detected .",
    "we will attempt to obtain redshifts of these extremely high redshift candidates using larger aperture telescopes .",
    "an indication that these objects are indeed that distant is the k @xmath33 20.5 limit we found for 2 of them , suggesting redshifts significantly beyond @xmath34 on the basis of the k@xmath35 relation .",
    "figure 2 plots spectral index against redshift for 4 different samples of radio sources .",
    "the 3cr and mrc surveys ( dots and crosses ) have no spectral index bias , but still show the spectral index @xmath5 redshift correlation .",
    "this relation is due to a combination of k@xmath5correction and intrinsic spectral curvature of the radio spectra ( carilli _ et al _ , in preparation ) .",
    "the 4c sample ( open circles ; @xmath36 ; median @xmath37 ) shows a rather uniform redshift distribution of sources , from @xmath38 to 3.8 , which includes a dramatically higher percentage of hzrgs than the surveys without spectral index bias .",
    "the initial results of our wn / tn sample have shown that we are even more efficient in finding @xmath39 sources than the 4c ( table 1 ) .",
    "the major differences between our sample and the 4c are our steeper spectral index cut - off and our lower flux limit .",
    "the higher median redshift in our sample can be interpreted as a combination of two effects : ( i ) an extension of the redshift @xmath5 spectral index relation towards steeper spectral@xmath5indices ; and ( ii ) our lower flux density limit causing the objects in our s@xmath0 10 mjy flux@xmath5limited sample to be more distant than the s@xmath40 2 jy 4c sample .",
    ".efficiencies in finding hzrgs [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the advantages of using radio galaxies instead of quasars to study the formation of giant ellipticals are their much large angular sizes and much fainter non - stellar agn . however , also radio galaxies have a residual contribution of non - stellar light from the central agn , confusing our view of the stellar population ( rawlings , these proceedings ) .",
    "a direct indication of this dependence is the correlation between emission - line luminosity and radio power @xcite .",
    "our initial results also show a rather weak correlation between the luminosity and radio power .",
    "the key to minimizing the effects of radio agn activity is therefore to probe lower powers , which we achieve with the much lower flux density limit of our sample .",
    "figure 3 shows that we are indeed beginning to find galaxies at these lower powers .",
    "the new galaxies at @xmath39 with p@xmath41 w / hz / sr will allow us to disentangle the redshift and power evolution of radio galaxies , with the caveat of using primarily uss sources at high redshift .",
    "the new radio surveys have allowed us to define a sample of faint ( s@xmath0 10 mjy ) sources with @xmath1 . we have found more @xmath39 sources than previous uss or other surveys , indicating the @xmath4 relation extends out to higher redshifts .",
    "the fraction of @xmath29 galaxies is less than 1/3 , indicating we are near the peak efficiency of the uss technique .",
    "stellar age estimates of the parent ellipticals of hzrgs all indicate formation redshifts @xmath42 5 .",
    "the 40% of our sources that have remained undetected with 3@xmath54 m class telescopes are prime targets for finding these ."
