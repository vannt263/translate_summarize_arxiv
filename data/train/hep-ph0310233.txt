    "data on the proton structure function @xmath0 from @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) scattering are usually interpreted in terms of the formalism for deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) where @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath0 is , therefore , interpreted in terms of the quark density functions @xmath7 in the proton and the gluon density enters via the dglap equations for evolution in @xmath1 .",
    "this formalism has also been applied to @xmath0 data at low @xmath1 where the exchanged photon is not far from being on - shell .",
    "parametrising such @xmath0 data in terms of quark and gluon density functions results in gluon distributions that tend to be negative at small @xmath1 @xcite , since otherwise the strong dglap evolution , driven primarily by the gluon at small @xmath2 , gives too large parton densities and thereby a poor fit to @xmath0 in the genuine dis region at large @xmath1 .",
    "although one may argue that the gluon density is not a directly observable quantity and hence might be negative , it certainly is in conflict with the normal interpretation in terms of the probability for a gluon with momentum fraction @xmath2 in the proton .",
    "in particular , such a gluon distribution may not be universal and applying it in other interactions may , therefore , give incorrect results .",
    "[ fig : resolution ]    the mistake is here to apply the formalism for dis also in the low-@xmath1 region , where the momentum transfer is not large enough that the parton structure of the proton is clearly resolved , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : resolution]a . for @xmath8 ,",
    "there is no hard scale involved and the interaction is a soft photon - proton interaction .",
    "the dominant cross - section is here given by the photon fluctuating into a vector meson state which then interacts with the proton in a strong interaction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : resolution]b ) , _ i.e. _  the vector meson dominance model .",
    "due to quantum fluctuations a photon may appear as a vector meson , _",
    "i.e. _   @xmath9 .",
    "the sum is over the vector meson states @xmath10 and the integral is for the generalisation to include a continous mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "this hadronic state then interacts with the target proton , resulting in transverse and longitudinal cross - sections @xmath11 , where the fluctuation probability includes the vector meson propagator and is given by gvdm phenomenology @xcite .",
    "the soft hadronic cross - section can be taken as the standard parametrisation @xmath12 , with @xmath13 in the pomeron exchange term which dominates over the reggeon exchange term at high energies .    in @xmath4 scattering ,",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 at small-@xmath2 . inserting the full gvdm expressions for @xmath16 results in @xcite @xmath17 here ,",
    "the last factor originating from @xmath18 only includes the pomeron term , since the reggeon term is negligible in the small-@xmath2 region relevant here .",
    "an overall normalisation constant @xmath19 is introduced giving ratios @xmath20 included in the parameters @xmath21 . in the curly bracket ,",
    "conventional vdm gives the sum over vector mesons with the characteristic vector meson propagators and the fluctuation constants @xmath22 involving the vector meson decay constant @xmath23 .",
    "besides the dominating contribution from transverse photons , the vdm sum contains a longitudinal contribution through the @xmath24-term .",
    "the term with @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) originates from the integral over the continous mass spectrum with a lower limit @xmath27 ( only the transverse contribution is here included since the longitudinal one is small ) .",
    "altogether , gvdm gives a more complex @xmath1 dependence than the simple vdm for transverse photons .",
    "the parameters involved are known from gvdm as @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 gev @xcite .",
    "the above expression for @xmath0 compares very well with the hera @xmath0 data at low @xmath1 , as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the fit gives @xmath31 with values as expected for the three free parameters used in the fit , namely @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "this demonstrates that at @xmath1 clearly below 1 gev@xmath35 the hera @xmath4 cross - section can be fully accounted for by gvdm using parameter values as determined from old investigations related to fixed target data .",
    "[ fig : lowq2 ]    at larger @xmath1 gvdm does not give the correct @xmath1 dependence since the resulting @xmath0 increases with @xmath1 .",
    "this may be interpreted physically as a need for a form factor suppression and we introduce the factor @xmath36 for @xmath37 to phase out gvdm . instead",
    ", the parton model should become applicable in the dis region . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : intermediateq2 ] , a good description of hera @xmath0 data at intermediate @xmath1 can be obtained by combining gvdm , with fitted values @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the form factor , and parton density functions that fit hera @xmath0 data at larger @xmath1 . as can be seen",
    ", gvdm gives a negligible contribution for @xmath40 .",
    "[ fig : intermediateq2 ]",
    "the parton distributions used in fig .",
    "[ fig : intermediateq2 ] are not just parametrisations , but are obtained from a model @xcite where valence quarks and gluons are derived from momentum fluctuations according to a gaussian distribution with a width given by the uncertainty relation and the proton size .",
    "sea quarks and gluons are obtained from similar momentum fluctuations in hadronic fluctuations of the proton , _",
    "i.e. _   @xmath42 this model gives a good description of available @xmath0 data with only a few fitted parameters @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it gives @xmath43 and @xmath44 in qualitative agreement with data , as well as @xmath45 of interest for the nutev anomaly @xcite .",
    "this model for parton distributions via hadronic fluctuations , fits very naturally together with gvdm based on hadronic fluctuations of the photon .",
    "the full generalised vector meson dominance model , including contributions from a continous mass spectrum and longitudinal polarisation states , reproduces hera @xmath0 data at very low @xmath1 using parameter values in agreement with old analyses of gvdm . introducing a form factor damping at larger",
    "@xmath1 gives a smooth transition into the deep inelastic region where a description of @xmath0 in terms of parton distribution functions become appropriate .",
