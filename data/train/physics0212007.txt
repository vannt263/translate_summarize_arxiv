    "the study of the solvation of alcohols in aqueous solution is of fundamental interest in physics , biology and chemistry , but also of importance in technical applications @xcite . among the alcohols ,",
    "ethanol is one the most well studied compounds .",
    "aqueous ethanol solutions are a common in chemical research and industry applications .",
    "ethanol can be produced by aqueous hydration of ethylene , that is readily available from natural sources .",
    "this process that can be accelerated by acid catalysis .",
    "the reverse route of decomposing of ethanol into water and ethylene is also of importance .",
    "for example , for developing countries who do not have a large supply of fossil fuels , dehydration of ethanol obtained from biomass is often the most economical way to produce ethylene .",
    "as is well known , solvation structures play a crucial role in aqueous solution chemistry , where reactive events often require a significant reordering of the water molecules in the solvation shell .",
    "the solvation of ethanol and ethylene are therefore crucial in the course of their ( acid - catalyzed ) interconversion .",
    "the aqueous solvation of these molecules will be addressed in the present paper .",
    "elsewhere we report on an _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics study of the acid - catalyzed conversion @xcite .",
    "ethanol and ethylene have distinct solvation properties in aqueous solution .",
    "ethanol is easily soluble as its polar hydroxyl group can participate in the hydrogen bonded network and the hydrophobic ethyl group is relatively small .",
    "in contrast , the apolar ethylene molecule has a much weaker interaction with water and is generally considered to be hydrophobic .",
    "mixtures of water and ethanol have been studied extensively , both experimentally as by molecular simulation .",
    "experimental studies employing nmr @xcite , ultrasonic absorption @xcite , infrared absorption spectroscopy @xcite , mass spectroscopy @xcite , x - ray diffraction measurements @xcite , neutron diffraction @xcite , and dielectric relaxation measurements @xcite have been performed to unravel the solvation properties of ethanol . molecular simulation studies using empirical force fields have addressed the equation of state , thermodynamics , and structure and dynamics of solvation @xcite of aqueous ethanol solutions .",
    "the following general picture of the aqueous solvation in dilute solutions has emerged : the hydroxyl group participates in the hydrogen bonded network , while the hydrophobic alkyl group is accommodated in the hydrogen bonded network of water molecules .",
    "the nature of hydration structure around the hydrophobic part of alcohols is still a controversial subject .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that hydrophobic solutes enforces the network of hydrogen bonded water molecules around it and decreases their mobility , a notion referred to as hydrophobic hydration @xcite .",
    "however , recent experimental and computational studies have shown that for small alcohols the structure and dynamics of the water molecules in the solvation shell is almost identical to that of bulk water @xcite .",
    "much less is known for the solvation of ethylene in water under ambient conditions .",
    "experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite work addressed the clathrate hydrates of ethylene in water .",
    "the isolated ethylene - water complex has been a subject of various studies . in the lowest energy configuration , the ethylene molecule forms a weak bond with water .",
    "an early _ ab initio _ study of del bene in 1974 @xcite has characterized this interaction as a @xmath0-h hydrogen bond of a water proton with the @xmath0 electrons of the c = c bond .",
    "several experimental techniques have been applied to measure the strength of this interaction , such as the matrix isolation study of engdahl and nelander @xcite , the microwave spectra study of andrews and kuczkowski @xcite and the molecular - beam measurements of peterson and klemperer @xcite .",
    "recently tarakeshwar et al .",
    "@xcite and dupr and yappert @xcite have performed calculations on the ethylene - water complexes with high level _ ab initio _ methods .",
    "the interaction is weak compared to a hydrogen bonds such as in the water dimer .",
    "the role of the @xmath0-h bond in aqueous solvation under ambient conditions is still an open question .",
    "molecular simulation provides an approach to study the microscopic behavior of liquids complementary to experimental studies .",
    "all molecular simulations studies of aqueous ethanol solutions up to now are based on empirical force fields that are designed to reproduce a selection of experimental data .",
    "obviously , molecular simulations based on these potentials do not provide a picture completely independent from experiment .",
    "moreover , the reliability of the results at conditions that are significantly different from those where the potential was designed for , may be questionable .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) based molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation , such as the car - parrinello molecular dynamics method @xcite , where the interactions are calculated by accurate electronic structure calculations , provides a route to overcome these limitations .",
    "this has been demonstrated in studies of liquid water @xcite and aqueous solvation @xcite .",
    "important advantages of dft - md over force - field md are that it intrinsically incorporates polarization , that it accounts for the intra - molecular motion and therefore allows for a direct comparison with spectroscopy of intra - molecular vibrations , and that it yields detailed information on the electronic properties , such as the energy levels of electronic states and the charge distribution . in a broader chemical perspective",
    "it is important to note that dft - md is capable to study chemical reactions in solution , where force - field md would fail completely as it can not account for the change in chemical bonding .    here",
    ", we report on a dft - based md simulation of the solvation of ethanol and ethylene .",
    "first we describe the simulation methods .",
    "then we show results of geometries and energetics of relevant gas - phase complexes , that will serve as a validation of the numerical methods employed .",
    "subsequently , results of structure , dynamics , and polarization of the solvated species will be shown .",
    "we conclude with a discussion .",
    "electronic structure calculations are performed using the kohn - sham @xcite formulation of dft @xcite .",
    "we employed the gradient - corrected blyp functional @xcite , that has proven to give a good description of the structure and dynamics of liquid water @xcite .",
    "the dft - based md simulations of aqueous ethanol and ethylene are performed using the car - parrinello method as implemented in the cpmd package @xcite .",
    "norm - conserving martins - trouillier pseudopotentials @xcite are used to restrict the number of electronic states to those of the valence electrons . cut - off radii for h , o and c atoms were chosen to be 0.50 , 1.11 and 1.23 a.u .",
    ", respectively both for the l = s and l = p terms .",
    "the kohn - sham orbitals are expanded in a plane wave basis , matching the periodicity of the periodic box with waves up to a kinetic energy of 70  ry . with this basis",
    "set energies and geometries are converged within 0.25  kcal / mol and 0.01   , respectively .",
    "vibrational frequencies are converged within 1 % , except for c - o and o - h stretch modes that are underestimated by 3 % and 5 % compared to the basis set limit values @xcite . in the molecular dynamics calculations , the fictitious mass associated with the plane - wave coefficients",
    "is chosen at 900 a.u . , which allowed for a time step in the numerical integration of the equations - of - motion of 0.145 fs .",
    "to validate the computational approach we compared cpmd results for energies and structures of relevant gas - phase molecules and complexes with state - of - the - art atomic - orbital dft - blyp calculations performed with adf @xcite , and other high - level quantum chemical results taken from literature .",
    "the gas - phase calculations with cpmd were performed in a large periodic box of 10    using the screening technique of @xcite to eliminate the interactions among periodic images .",
    "we have not included zero - point energies in the energies of the gas - phase compounds .",
    "this also holds for computed energies taken from literature and referred to in the present paper .",
    "this , to ensure a proper comparison between our results and those from literature .    the md simulations of the solutions were performed for a small and a large system to asses the finite size effects .",
    "for the small system a simulation of 10 ps was performed in a cubic periodic box of length 10.07  , both for an ethanol solution of 31 waters and 1 ethanol as for an ethylene solution of 32 water and 1 ethylene . for the large system 5 ps simulations",
    "were performed using a periodic box with bcc symmetry and a volume of 1977.6 @xmath1 .",
    "this periodic cell , a truncated octahedron , is in shape closer to a sphere than a simple cube , and therefore better suited for liquid simulation .",
    "the large ethanol solution consisted of 63 waters and 1 ethanol , while the large ethylene solution consisted of 64 waters and 1 ethylene .",
    "the box sizes for both the ethanol and ethylene solutions were set to match the experimental densities of the ethanol solutions under ambient conditions . for the ethylene system",
    "this will be slightly larger than the experimental density , as the effective volume of ethanol is a bit smaller than the combined volume of ethylene + water .",
    "however , we do not expect this to give rise to observable changes in the calculated properties .",
    "for reference we performed 10  ps md simulations of a single ethanol and ethylene in a periodic cubic box of 10    and a pure water systems of 32 water molecules in a cubic box of 9.85    for simulation times of 10 ps .",
    "for all simulations there was an initial equilibration trajectory of 1  ps .",
    "temperature was controlled by a nos - hoover thermostat @xcite and fixed at 300  k.",
    "the ethanol monomer has two stable conformers very close in energy , the symmetric trans structure and the a - symmetric gauche structure ( see fig .  [ transgauche ] ) .",
    "the main distinction is the orientation of the oh bond with respect to the cco plane .",
    "a microwave study @xcite has shown that the trans form is slightly ( 0.12  kcal / mol ) more stable than the gauche form .",
    "table  [ tableethanol ] lists the most important geometric data of the trans and gauche conformers , and compares the cpmd results with adf calculations , b3lyp calculations @xcite , and experimental data @xcite .",
    "cpmd and adf bond lengths differ at most 0.01    and angles are within 0.5@xmath2 . comparing cpmd with b3lyp and experimental values yields differences upto 0.03     and 0.5@xmath2 , and 0.04     and 1@xmath2 respectively .",
    "the calculated energy difference between the two conformers is listed in fig .",
    "[ figen ] .",
    "cpmd , adf , b3lyp of ref .",
    "@xcite , and mp4 @xcite predict the trans conformer to be stable by 0.07 - 0.10  kcal / mol , in good agreement with the experimental value of @xmath3  kcal / mol .",
    "in contrast , the b3lyp calculation of @xcite yields the opposite , with the gauche conformer stable by @xmath4  kcal / mol .",
    "vibrational frequencies obtained by a fourier transform of the velocity auto correlation function ( vacf ) of a single ethanol at 300  k yields an oh stretch frequency of 3200 @xmath5 and a ch stretch frequencies in the range of 2600 - 2800 @xmath5 .",
    "this should be compared to the experimental values of 3653 @xmath5 @xcite , and 2800 - 3000 @xmath5 @xcite , respectively .",
    "the tendency of blyp to underestimate frequencies by @xmath6  10% is a known feature , and also observed in blyp calculations of water @xcite and methanol @xcite .    for the ethanol - water complex we distinguished four complexes , with both the ethanol trans and gauche conformer acting as proton donor or acceptor in the hydrogen bond with water .",
    "table  [ tableetha - wat ] lists the most important geometric data obtained with cpmd and adf .",
    "[ figen ] shows the energy differences for all complexes . as for the ethanol monomer",
    "there is excellent agreement between cpmd and adf results , with deviations within 0.02    and 2@xmath2 for bond lengths and angles , and the binding energies within 0.2  kcal / mol .",
    "this indicates a state - of - the art accuracy of the electronic - structure method employed in cpmd .",
    "the cpmd - blyp calculation predicts the complex with the water molecule donating a proton to the ethanol gauche conformer to be the most stable , with a binding energy relative to the isolated water and trans ethanol conformer of 4.75  kcal / mol .",
    "the complex with the ethanol trans conformer donating a proton is less stable by 0.82  kcal / mol .",
    "switching to the other ethanol conformer within either complex destabilizes the complex by 0.07 and 0.4  kcal / mol , respectively .",
    "the relative stability of the ethanol donor and acceptor complexes is similar to that for the methanol - water complex where cpmd - blyp @xcite and the complete - basis - set mp2 estimate @xcite yields the methanol acceptor complex stable by 0.74 and 0.35  kcal / mol , respectively .",
    "there are no experimental data for the structure and energetics of the ethanol - water dimer .",
    "the mp2 result of ref .",
    "@xcite provides the only high - level quantum mechanical study reported in literature .",
    "this study does not distinguish between the trans and gauche conformers .",
    "therefore , a comparison with our results is somewhat limited .",
    "for the ethanol acceptor configuration the mp2 and cpmd - blyp result for the complexation energy are similar .",
    "however , for the ethanol donor configuration the mp2 complexation energy is more than 1.3  kcal / mol larger than the cpmd - blyp results .",
    "consequently , the mp2 calculations yield an opposite relative stability of the two water - ethanol configurations , with an energy difference of 0.92  kcal / mol .",
    "it should be noted that in the same study the methanol - water complex with the methanol as hydrogen bond donor is found to be the most stable , in contradiction with the mp2 basis - set limit result of ref .",
    "this suggests that in the ref .  @xcite a limited basis set or other factors could have lead to spurious reversal of the relative stability of the two water - ethanol configurations .",
    "the cpmd - blyp hydrogen bond interaction energy for the ethanol - water dimer is of the same order of magnitude as the cpmd - blyp result for the water - water @xcite , water - methanol @xcite , and methanol - methanol @xcite dimer .",
    "comparison of these three dimers against high - level quantum chemical calculations and experimental values indicates that blyp underestimates the binding energy by approximately 1  kcal / mol . for the ethanol - water dimer we could expect a similar difference .",
    "here we should add that going from water , via methanol , to ethanol the dispersion forces become increasingly important .",
    "these are not accounted for in gradient - corrected functionals such as blyp .",
    "correlated methods such mp2 incorporate , to a good approximation , dispersion forces . in ref .",
    "@xcite we estimated , in a comparison of blyp and high - level mp2 calculations @xcite for the methanol - dimer in non - hydrogen bonded configurations , that the absence of dispersion interaction in blyp amounted to an underestimate of the binding energy of @xmath61  kcal / mol .",
    "for the ethanol - water dimer this number could serve as an underestimate . yet , although by far no insignificant , the magnitude of the deviation is much smaller than the hydrogen - bond interaction .",
    "therefore , it can be argued that for a study of aqueous ethanol neglecting the dispersion interaction is acceptable .",
    "next we discuss the ethylene - water complexes .",
    "we will consider complexes with a single water and a water dimer .",
    "the dominant interaction of water with ethylene is a @xmath0-h bond , where a proton of the water molecule binds to @xmath0 electrons of the double c = c bond .",
    "there exist two stable complexes between ethylene and a single water molecule , indicated as the ew1a and ew1b geometry ( see fig .",
    "[ ew1aew1b ] ) .",
    "both geometries have cs symmetry with the plane of the water molecule orthogonal to that of ethylene molecule . in the ew1a structure",
    "the water - plane is parallel to the c = c bond , whereas in ew1b it is orthogonal . in table",
    "[ tableethewat ] we compare the cpmd - blyp geometries with adf - blyp and mp2@xcite and ccsd @xcite results .",
    "[ figen ] shows the energy differences , and compares these to values reported in literature .",
    "again the cpmd and adf results are in excellent agreement , with energies smaller than 0.02  kcal / mol , and geometries within 0.01     and 0.3@xmath7 , except for the non bonded oh@xmath8 distance that is related to water orientation , a coordinate along with the energy surface is relatively flat .",
    "the blyp result shows a significant @xmath0-h binding energy of  @xmath6  1.4  kcal / mol .",
    "however , in mp2 @xcite and ccsd @xcite calculations , binding energies are @xmath6  1 - 2  kcal / mol stronger , accompanied by a shorter @xmath0-h bond with differences of 0.12     and 0.14     for ew1a and ew1b , respectively .",
    "the comparison with the experimental value gives a similar picture with the blyp underestimating the binding energy @xmath6  2  kcal / mol .",
    "matrix isolation studies@xcite have revealed that the complex of ethylene with two water molecules consists of a water dimer that has one water molecule @xmath0-h bonded to the c = c double bond .",
    "recent high - level mp2 calculations have indicated that the presence of the second water molecule enhances the strength of the @xmath0-h bond@xcite . from fig .",
    "[ figen ] we see that blyp result are qualitatively in line with this observation , with a binding energy of the ( water - dimer)-ethylene complex of 2.25  kcal / mol , up from 1.41  kcal / mol for the single - water binding .",
    "however , quantitatively mp2 and blyp compare less well , with blyp underestimating both the total binding energy as well as the increase from the single - water binding . again , the experimental value@xcite , that is closer to the mp2 result , shows a significantly stronger binding than blyp . both for the water - ethylene and the ( water - dimer)-ethylene complex the differences of blyp with mp2 and experiment are significant relative to the total binding energy .",
    "this absence of dispersion interaction in blyp will be an important factor contribution to this discrepancy .",
    "overall , we conclude that the reference calculations provide confidence that blyp is capable of a quantitative study of a the aqueous solvation of a single ethanol molecule where interactions are dominated by relatively strong hydrogen bonds .",
    "blyp qualitatively accounts for the weaker @xmath0-h binding in water - ethylene systems .",
    "however , comparison with mp2 and experimental data suggest that its strength is significantly underestimated . yet , for a single solvated ethylene the hydrogen bonds among the solvating water molecules will be the dominant interaction . hence , we believe that blyp will be able to quantitative described dilute aqueous ethylene solution . both for ethanol and ethylene the absence of dispersion attraction in blyp will have some impact , in particular for the coordination around the ch@xmath9 and ch@xmath10 groups , where blyp only accounts for the steric repulsion .",
    "fig . [ figrad ] shows ethanol - water radial distribution functions ( rdfs ) of the small and large ethanol solutions .",
    "the pronounced structure in the hydrogen bonding rdfs ( hh , oh , ho , oo ) are a clear indication of the presence of hydrogen bonds .",
    "all rdfs show that the small system gives a good description of the first solvation shell , while the large system also includes the second solvation shell .",
    "the peak positions of the force - field simulations of fidler and rodger @xcite , indicated by crosses , are close to our results .",
    "note that the good agreement for the co rdfs , that are potentially sensitive to a proper description of the dispersion attraction , suggests that the absence of the dispersion interaction in our cpmd - blyp simulation is of limited importance for a proper description of the aqueous solvation of the hydrophobic group of ethanol .",
    "the position of the first peak of the oh- and ho - rdf indicates that the average hydrogen - bond length is 1.7     for both the ethanol - donor and -acceptor bond .",
    "integration of the oo - rdf upto the first minimum @xmath11    yields on average 3 water molecules in the first solvation shell of the hydroxyl group , in good agreement with the neutron diffraction value of @xmath6  3 @xcite . integrating the methyl - oxygen ( c@xmath9o )",
    "rdf up to @xmath12    indicates that the first solvation shell of the methyl group consists of approximately 21 water molecules .",
    "these coordination numbers are of the same order as the experimental estimation of petrillo et al .",

    "both the carbon - oxygen and the intermolecular carbon - hydrogen rdfs are shown .",
    "experimental or simulation data for ethylene in aqueous solution at room temperature were not available .",
    "the comparison between the small and large system shows a larger deviation in the first solvation shell than was found for the ethanol solutions .",
    "apparently , the small ethylene system is not able to accommodate properly the first solvation shell .",
    "integration the co - rdf of the large system up to the first minimum at 5.7    yields a hydration shell of 23 water molecules .",
    "more spatial information can be extracted from fig .",

    "the figure shows a well defined elliptic region with no hydrogens present except for two weak , but clearly visible , peaks in the mid plane @xmath16 at @xmath17 .",
    "these should be attributed to the presence of @xmath18 bonded configurations .      in fig .",
    "[ figradwater ] the calculated water oxygen - oxygen rdfs of both the ethanol and the ethylene solutions are compared to those calculated for pure water .",
    "note that the first solvation shell contains a large fraction of the total number of water molecules , especially for the small system .",
    "structural changes due to the solute molecule should therefore be detectable by comparing these systems with the pure water system .",
    "for the ethanol solution we see a small drop of the first peak accompanied by a slight increase at the first minimum .",
    "this indicates some decrease in the hydrogen - bond structure , when compared to the pure water . as the small ethylene - water solution is too small to accommodate a fully relaxed water solvation shell fig .",
    "[ figradwater ] only shows the rdfs of the large ethylene system .",
    "the rdfs show a similar behavior as for the ethanol solvation , with a slight decrease of the first peak and a small increase of the rdf in the region around the first minimum .",
    "the small changes in the structure of the solvating water shell around ethanol and ethylene indicate that the hydrogen - bonded water network is very flexible and can easily open up to accommodate small apolar solute groups without significantly changing its structure .",
    "our findings are consistent with the neutron diffraction experiments of turner and soper @xcite and force - field molecular dynamics simulation of fidler and rodger @xcite who also did not find any evidence of structural enhancement in the hydration shell of ethanol .",
    "turner and soper found that only for larger hydrophobic solutes this effect was experimentally detectable , but even then very small .",
    "the same trend was found for in a cpmd - blyp molecular dynamics study of the solvation of methanol @xcite .      to examine the hydrogen bond statistics in the ethanol solution we adopted the definition of ref .",
    "@xcite : two molecules are hydrogen bonded if simultaneously the inter - oxygen distance is less than 3.4    and the oho angle is smaller than 30@xmath7 . with this definition we found that , for the large system , ethanol oxygen donates on average 0.9 hydrogen bonds and accepts 1.7 . for the small system we found 1.0 and 1.6 , respectively",
