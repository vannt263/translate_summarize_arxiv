    "ulasj1120 + 0641  however has a softer x - ray spectrum than is typical for any of these samples .",
    "it is well established @xcite that x - ray spectral indices @xmath82 are associated with large ratios of @xmath83 where @xmath84 is bolometric luminosity and @xmath85 is eddington luminosity .",

    "second , we examine the implications of super - eddington accretion for the constraints on the seed black hole . considering that the bolometric luminosity of the quasar is rather better determined than its black hole mass , we can take the black hole mass to scale inversely with @xmath83 ; adopting the luminosity and mass estimates from @xcite , this implies @xmath90  m@xmath28 .",
    "more importantly , the e - folding timescale is inversely proportional to @xmath83 , implying a larger ratio of final to seed black hole mass for higher @xmath83 . for reference",
    ", we would require seed black holes of @xmath91  m@xmath28 and @xmath92  m@xmath28 for formation redshifts of @xmath20 and @xmath93 respectively if the quasar has had @xmath94 since the formation of its seed .",
    "the assumption that the quasar has accreted continuously , and without significant off - periods , i.e. a duty cycle close to 1 , would be unrealistic for quasars with @xmath95 , but is reasonable for quasars with @xmath75 @xcite . to have grown the black hole in ulasj1120 + 0641  from a 100  m@xmath28 seed would require an average value of @xmath96 over the lifetime of the quasar if the seed formed at @xmath20 or @xmath97 if the seed formed at @xmath93 .",
    "such values of @xmath83 are compatible with the observational constraints , hence ulasj1120 + 0641  could have grown from the remnant of a population iii star , as well as from the remnant of a quasi - star , or from a collapsed stellar cluster @xcite , if it has maintained such a rate of growth throughout its existence .",
