    "one possible new - physics scenario that will be probed at the lhc is the addition of a fourth generation to the standard model ( sm ) , resulting in a model generally denoted 4 .",
    "a fourth family brings with it several interesting consequences  @xcite .",
    "it has implications for the status of and search for the higgs boson  @xcite , and can help remove the tension between the sm fit and the lower bound on the higgs - boson mass from lep @xcite . adding only one extra generation to the sm is consistent with all precision tests , even with a higgs as heavy as @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "4 is consistent with @xmath8 unification without supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "electroweak baryogenesis can not be accomodated in the sm with three generations , but it may be plausible in 4 , due to the presence of additional weak phases and the contribution of the heavy fourth - generation quarks to the jarlskog invariant in the four - generation cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix ( 4 )  @xcite .",
    "a rather heavy fourth generation could also naturally give rise to dynamical electroweak - symmetry breaking  @xcite , since a quark with a mass of more than about half a  @xmath9 falls in the strong coupling region  @xcite .",
    "the cdf collaboration has searched for the decay of a heavy @xmath1 quark to a @xmath10 boson and a jet . assuming this is the dominant decay mode",
    ", they set a limit on the @xmath1 mass , @xmath11 at 90% c.l .",
    "cdf has also looked for @xmath12 , setting the limit @xmath13 at 95% c.l .  @xcite . with higher energy and luminosity than the tevatron",
    ", the lhc will have much greater sensitivity for the discovery of fourth - generation quarks and could measure some of their parameters .",
    "of particular importance to flavor physics is the measurement of the 4 matrix elements , specifically @xmath5 , which is the main focus of this paper .",
    "while a fourth generation is consistent with precision electroweak data , stringent constraints exist on the deviation of the 4 diagonal element @xmath5 from unity , as well as on the mass splitting of the fourth - generation quark doublet .",
    "in particular , the best fit gives @xmath14 , where we have assumed that the contribution from the fourth - generation leptons is negligible due to a small lepton - neutrino mass splitting .",
    "therefore , in this paper we explore the implications of 4 with @xmath15 , restricting the discussion to this scenario .",
    "the decay @xmath16 is then not permitted , and one must consider other decay modes .",
    "the three - body decay @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is an off - shell @xmath10 boson producing a @xmath19 pair , is kinematically suppressed .",
    "the decay involving a virtual @xmath2 , @xmath20 , is found to be even smaller . a large value of @xmath6 and the unitarity of 4 lead to suppression of two - body decays @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "penguin decays are both 4- and loop - suppressed and are found to have negligible branching fractions . calculating the rates of these processes ,",
    "we show that for a substantial range of the parameters , @xmath6 can be determined from the ratio of the branching fractions of @xmath17 and @xmath21 .",
    "now , it is well known that , because the @xmath23 quark decays rapidly , there is not enough time for it to hadronize . on the other hand",
    ", we find that , for a sizable part of the allowed parameter space , the decay rates of the @xmath1 are small enough that hadronization of this fourth - generation quark can occur .",
    "the formation of such a bound state is an interesting consequence of fourth - generation quarks .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : ew - constraints ] we review constraints on the fourth - generation parameters .",

    "it is necessary to take values for the 4 matrix elements , in particular @xmath6 .",
    "limits on these matrix elements can be found by considering the loop - level contributions of the fourth generation to various flavor - physics observables .",

    "it is interesting to note that , unlike in the case of the top quark , kinematic suppression of the ckm - favored @xmath1 decay implies that for a significant range of allowed values of @xmath6 , the @xmath1 lifetime is long enough for this quark to hadronize .",
