    "the panda experiment@xcite has a rather wide program , that includes electromagnetic and strong hard processes in collisions between antiproton beams and unpolarized nuclear targets ( see ref.@xcite , or more synthetically ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the center - of - mass energy will range from small values up to about @xmath0 gev ( beam energy ranging from 1 to 13 gev ) . among the planned ones , measurements of drell - yan processes@xcite",
    "will be performed in the highest part of the beam energy spectrum , with attention to both di - muon and di - electron production .",
    "drell - yan is a very well studied class of inclusive processes , however up to date very little information is available on the ( normally undetected ) fragments produced in association with the drell - yan lepton pair .",
    "what is available ( essentially : charge multiplicity ) was measured in collider experiments at very large center of mass energy ( e.g.@xcite , where @xmath1 @xmath2 50 - 100 gev ) .",
    "no information of this kind is available from fixed - target experiments at much lower @xmath1 .",
    "the point is that the really appealing aspect of a drell - yan measurement is that one needs @xmath3 to care these particles , since one may build a relatively simple apparatus where a thick screen absorbes everything but muons , and muons are analyzed downstream with respect to the screens .",
    "so , only multi - purpose apparata may be suitable to analyze hadronic or electromagnetic fragments that accompany the dilepton production .",
    "panda is a multipurpose apparatus , with a very peculiar feature : its on - line filters will be reduced to a minimum , so that at each collision all the following fragments will be detected ( within the large experiment acceptance ) .",
    "the idea is to record everything , to later select different processes in the data analysis phase .    to understand what kind of phenomenology one could meet ,",
    "i have performed some simulations , using the popular high - energy montecarlo generator pythia-8 @xcite .",
    "although this is @xmath3 the energy regime for which this code has been optimized , some features determining the fragments are so universal ( in particular in the panda case : the size of the available phase space ) that the gross features of the predicted distributions should be reliable.[multiblock footnote omitted ] and these features leave room for interesting perspectives .    here",
    "i have studied the class of drell - yan events where the dilepton mass and transverse momentum are @xmath4 2 gev / c@xmath5 and @xmath4 0.8 gev / c respectively . below the mass 1.8 gev / c@xmath5 , the effect of the tails of the vector resonances is strong , and it may be ambiguous to associate dileptons to drell - yan events .",
    "we must remark that at increasing masses the event rates become increasingly suppressed , roughly as @xmath6 .",
    "so , most of the drell - yan events considered here have a dilepton mass near 2 gev / c@xmath5 , and this will be the situation in panda ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for systematic studies of the expected dilepton distributions in panda ) . in present - day unpolarized drell - yan , the most interesting observables are those associated with azimuthal asymmetries ( @xcite , see also @xcite for a very general and systematic treatment of the cross section structure ) .",
    "these become visible at transverse momenta of magnitude 1 - 2 gev / c ( see the previous measurements by refs .",
    "@xcite ) . taking into account that the drell - yan event rates will be peaked at transverse momenta @xmath7 @xmath8",
    "gev / c , an event with @xmath9 @xmath10 1 gev / c will be the most common among the interesting ones@xcite",
    ".    pythia does not include detailed features like azimuthal asymmetries .",
    "so what is simulated here is @xmath3 exactly what we will see in the experiment , where it will be interesting , and new , to be able to study joint azimuthal distributions of the dilepton and of the fragments .",
    "but the pythia - based analysis presented here may tell us which kind of fragment combinations it will make sense to analyze .",
    "the most appealing result of the following simulations is that drell - yan is , in panda conditions , a `` quasi - exclusive '' process .",
    "potentially this will allow for theoretical modelling in a way that would be unusual from the point of view of traditional drell - yan physics .",
    "50,000 drell - yan events have been here sorted using pythia-8 , according to what has been imagined as a reasonable kinematical setup for panda : antiproton beam energy 15 gev , at - rest target protons , dilepton minimum mass 2 gev / c@xmath5 and dilepton minimum transverse momentum 0.8 gev / c .",
    "@xmath4 2 here ) .",
    "the cutoffs on the dilepton mass and transverse momentum are : @xmath11 @xmath4 2 gev / c@xmath5 , @xmath9 @xmath4 0.8 gev / c . ,",
    "width=340 ]    for real photons in the final state , i have included a lower cutoff on the detection : @xmath12 @xmath4 0.2 gev .",
    "the number of radiated photons with arbitrarily low energy is in principle infinite .",
    "so the particle multiplicities in the following must be understood as excluding `` soft '' photons .",
    "neutral pions do not appear directly in the final state .",
    "they are present via their offspring photons .",
    "so , in the following `` pions '' means `` charged pions '' .",
    "figure 1 and tables 1 , 2 and 3 are devoted to event multiplicities .",
    "they include the lepton - antilepton pair into the total event multiplicity .",
    "so , the lowest recorded event multiplicity is 4 ( normally : lepton , antilepton , nucleon , antinucleon ) .    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ [ cols=\">,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      +   + table 5 : number of charged particles surviving a forward cutoff at 7.5@xmath13 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _",
    "so , i may estimate that we will detect 45 % of the @xmath14only events ( 0.45 @xmath10 0.52 * 0.87 ) , 37 % of the @xmath15 and of the @xmath16 events ( 0.37 @xmath10 0.45 * 0.83 ) , and so on . for events with a not too large number of particles ,",
    "satisfactory rates are not a problem , starting from these numbers .",
    "the more subtle problem is : how much the forward dead cone will lead us to confuse events with @xmath17 and with @xmath18 particles ?",
    "since the 50 % probability to miss the antiproton regards @xmath19 the below analyzed events with charged particles , i will not take this factor into account in most of the following with an event @xmath20 in first approximation does not depend on the acceptance on @xmath21 or @xmath22 . at a finer level of analysis , because of the kinematical conservation laws there can be a correlation between the probabilities of observing e.g. a proton and a pion in given kinematical conditions .",
    "this correlation is neglected here . ] .",
    "in addition , i will assume that those events where @xmath23 light particles enter the dead cone may be neglected .",
    "so , the noise to `` @xmath14only '' events is constituted by `` @xmath24 '' events , the noise to `` @xmath24 '' events is constituted `` @xmath25 '' events and so on .",
    "last , it is assumed in the following that all the considered events are associated to a detected dilepton pair .",
    "this class contains 10747 events of the simulation , i.e. about 21 % of the total and 49 % of all the events where a @xmath26 pair is present . as above",
    "stated , i will assume that among the remaining 51 % only those containing @xmath27 extra light particle ( charged pion or gamma ) may easily be confused with events of the @xmath14only class .",
    "the events of the class `` @xmath26 @xmath28 1 light particle '' are 2743 , and in 82 - 84 % of the cases the extra light particle is detected .",
    "this means that in about 466 cases we will not see it .",
    "the noise - to - signal ratio is then 466/(10747@xmath28466 ) i.e. 4 % .",
    "the case where the `` 1 '' is specifically a pion is considered later .",
    "here charged pions and photons are equivalently counted .    the starting point are 2793 `` true ''",
    "@xmath24 events , of which we only see 2327 @xmath10 2793 @xmath29 466 ( see the previous case ( a ) ) .",
    "we have 5428 events with @xmath26 and two light particles .",
    "assuming that 83 % is the average detection probability for a photon or pion , we have 0.83 * 0.83 @xmath10 0.69 probability to detect both .",
    "so , 31 % of the above 5428 events , i.e. 1683 events , will show one light particle only .",
    "so only 42 % ( i.e. 1683/@xmath30 ) of the apparent number of @xmath24 events really belongs to this class .",
    "we have 5428 true @xmath25 events , of which we detect 5428 @xmath29 1683 @xmath10 3745 .",
    "three light particles appear in 1521 events , and the probability to detect all three is @xmath31 . neglecting the subtraction of the 2nd - order set overlap ( i.e. of the events where @xmath23 of these three particles",
    "are not detected ) this means a probability 0.43 to see two particles only , so 654 apparent @xmath25 events .",
    "so the fraction of false @xmath25 events is @xmath32 @xmath10 15 % .",
    "clearly when we become more specific about the class of the two light particles ( @xmath33 or @xmath34 ) accompanying dilepton and @xmath26 , the contamination ratio decreases , but 15 % is a good upper limit for the noise - to - signal ratio .      the previous difficulty in distinguishing events with one light particle is much decreased if we exclude photons ( so also neutral pions ) from our analysis .",
    "indeed , from table 3 we see that the large number of events with two light particles , compared with events with one , is due to a large number of photons in the two - light - particle case . on the contrary charged pions",
    "respect the `` natural hyerarchy '' since charged - pion pairs are 3 times less abundant than single pions .    on the other side ,",
    "to identify 1-pion - inclusive events is essential to be able to indentify @xmath35inclusive and @xmath36inclusive events ( see point ( f ) below ) .",
    "we have 7836 events with one charged pion , among which only 7836 * 0.82 @xmath10 6426 events will be indentified experimentally .",
    "then we have 2814 events with two charged pions , among which there is a subset @xmath37 @xmath10 922 events that appear as one - pion events ( or as no - pion events , i will here neglect this less frequent possibility ) .",
    "this means a fraction @xmath38 @xmath10 13 % of false single pion events .",
    "events where @xmath40 particles of any kind are identified ( apart for the dilepton pair ) may be identified with @xmath39only events , in principle .",
    "these events constitute 20 % of the total ( table 2 ) , and they are easy to identify , since the noise is given either by events with a single photon , or with a pair of opposite - charge hadrons .",
    "an estimate like those of the previous points suggests that these contaminations are not huge .",
    "however , these events tell us little , missing more direct information . it must be observed that the total 4-momentum of the @xmath41 pair is automatically determined since it must exactly balance the dilepton 4-momentum . we can not however access information on the relative configuration of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , so to know that an event is of @xmath39only nature does not give us access to new observables .",
    "the 7993 events with a `` mixed '' pair are events where we see a proton not accompanied by an antiproton , or viceversa , and an odd number of charged pions . here",
    "i only consider the case of one accompanying charged pion .",
    "i assume that the numbers of @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the same , i.e. about 4000 .",
    "the main error comes from @xmath46 pairs where @xmath21 or @xmath22 , @xmath47 one of the two pions , are not detected .    identifying a @xmath44 event on the ground that we find a proton unaccompanied by an antiproton ( i.e. without checking for the pion ) would be really unsafe , since 2000 protons coming from a @xmath44 pair are overcome by about 12,400 @xmath26 events where",
    "the antiproton is not seen because of the forward dead cone .",
    "this means about 0.14 probability for identifying a mixed pair from a single proton .    in the @xmath45 case half of the true 4000 events",
    "is not detected because of the antiproton in the dead cone .",
    "the left 2000 events must be matched to 3200 @xmath26 events where the proton is not seen .",
    "so , when we see an antiproton without a companion proton we have 38 % probability that it comes from an @xmath45 pair .",
    "so , in both cases we need to identify the accompanying pion to have a clear signature of the event , hoping that we are not confusing a single - pion event with a double - pion event .",
    "this confusion , as estimated previuously , takes place in 13 % of the single - pion detections , but in this case this number can be divided by two . indeed , the pion accompanying the mixed pair must carry a well defined charge , while in the case of a missing pion from a pion pair the previously calculated 13 % factor includes both charges with equal probability .",
    "so , to quantify the chances that a @xmath48 pair is associated to an @xmath45 mixed pair we need to compare ( 1 - 0.13/2)*0.38 to ( 1 - 0.38)*(0.13/2 ) .",
    "the latter is the probability that we have found a @xmath26 pair accompanied by two pions , and is much smaller than the former .",
    "so the identification of the detected @xmath48 pair as an event containing an @xmath45 pair is quite safe .    in the case of a proton and a negative pion",
    ", we have to match ( 1 - 0.13/2)*0.14 vs ( 0.13/2)*(1 - 0.14 ) , i.e. 0.13 vs 0.06 .",
    "this means that in 1/3 of the cases our identification of an event containing a @xmath36pair from a detected @xmath49 pair is wrong .",
    "it must be observed that in the mixed - pair case the accessible information is larger than in the @xmath41 case , since we have some knowledge of the reciprocal orientation of the produced fragments . on the other side ,",
    "these fragments are at least three ( with possibly additional dead cone photons ) , with potential difficulties in theoretical modelling .",
    "the limiting feature of drell - yan in panda ( its reduced energy ) may be converted into a strength point .",
    "we have the possibility to analyze in detail more complex and exclusive events where the drell - yan dilepton pair is accompanied by hadronic / e.m .",
    "fragments that are recorded in detail .",
    "the limited phase space of this experiment makes the number of accompanying fragments small .",
    "an analysis of the involved statistics , after taking panda acceptance into account , shows that some features of the simplest fragment combinations ( in particular : of a pure proton - antiproton pair ) may be studied with reasonable safety : the statistics is reasonable , the danger of confusion with events of different nature is small .",
