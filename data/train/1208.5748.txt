    "in this contribution , we report on the development and results from a dynamical coupled - channel ( dcc ) analysis by a collaboration associated with the excited baryon analysis center ( ebac ) at jefferson lab during the period january , 2006 - march , 2012 .",
    "this project has three components : ( 1 ) perform a dynamical coupled - channels analysis on the _ world _ data on meson production reactions from the nucleon to determine the meson - baryon partial - wave amplitudes , ( 2 ) extract the @xmath0 parameters from the determined partial - wave amplitudes , and ( 3 ) investigate the interpretations of the extracted @xmath0 properties in terms of the available hadron models and lattice qcd .",
    "the dcc analysis by the collaboration@xmath1ebac is based on an extension  @xcite of the dynamical model for the @xmath2(1232 ) resonance developed @xcite by an argonne national laboratory - osaka university ( anl - osaka ) collaboration . within the extended anl - osaka formulation  @xcite ,",
    "the reaction amplitudes @xmath3 in each partial - wave are calculated from the following coupled - channels integral equations , @xmath4 where @xmath5 , and @xmath6 which has @xmath7 resonant components , @xmath8 are meson - exchange interactions deduced from phenomenological lagrangian , @xmath9 describes the excitation of the nucleon to a bare @xmath0 state with a mass @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is a meson - baryon propagator .",
    "the dcc model , defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cct ] ) and  ( [ eq : ccv ] ) , satisfies two- and three - body unitarity conditions .    in order to determine the parameters associated with the strong - interaction parts of @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ccv ] ) , the considered dcc model was first applied to fit the @xmath13 elastic scattering up to invariant mass @xmath14 gev . for simplicity , @xmath15 and",
    "@xmath16 channels were not included during the development stage in 2006 - 2010 .",
    "the electromagnetic parts of @xmath12 were then determined by fitting the data of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the resulting 6-channel model was then tested by comparing the predicted @xmath19 production cross sections with the data . in parallel to analyzing the data , a procedure to analytically continue eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cct ] ) and  ( [ eq : ccv ] ) to the complex energy plane was developed to extract the positions and residues of nucleon resonances .    in the following , we present a sample of results from these efforts .      in fitting the @xmath13 elastic scattering",
    ", we found that one or two bare @xmath0 states were needed in each partial wave .",
    "the coupling strengths of the @xmath20 vertex interactions @xmath21 with @xmath22 were then determined in the @xmath23-fits to the data .",
    "our results were given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our next step was to determine the bare @xmath24 interaction @xmath25 by fitting the @xmath26 and @xmath27 data .",
    "we found  @xcite that we were able to fit the data only up to invariant mass @xmath28 gev , mainly because we did not adjust any parameter which was already fixed in the fits to @xmath13 elastic scattering .",
    "some of our results for total cross sections ( @xmath29 ) , differential cross sections ( @xmath30 , and photon asymmetry ( @xmath31 ) are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : gnpin ] .",
    "the @xmath32-dependence of the @xmath25 vertex functions were then determined  @xcite by fitting the @xmath33 and @xmath34 data up to @xmath28 gev and @xmath35 ( gev / c)@xmath36 .    ) , differential cross sections ( @xmath30 , and photon asymmetry ( @xmath31 ) of @xmath37 ( upper parts ) , @xmath27 ( lower parts ) . ]",
    "the model constructed from fitting the data on single pion production reactions was then tested by examining the extent to which the @xmath38 and @xmath39 data can be described .",
    "it was found  @xcite that the predicted total cross sections are in excellent agreement with the data in the near threshold region @xmath40 gev . in the higher @xmath41 region",
    ", the predicted @xmath38 cross sections can describe to a very large extent the available data , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pnppn ] . here",
    "the important role of the coupled - channel effects were also demonstrated .",
    "however , the predicted @xmath42 cross sections were a factor of about 2 larger than the data while the shapes of two - particles invariant mass distributions could be described very well .",
    "are compared with the data .",
    "the dashed - curves are obtained when the coupled - channel effects are turned off within the dcc model of ref.@xcite . ]",
    "we follow earlier work , as reviewed and explained in refs .",
    "@xcite , to define that the resonances are the eigenstates of the hamiltonian with only outgoing waves of their decay channels .",
    "one can then show that the nucleon resonance positions are the poles @xmath43 of meson - baryon scattering amplitudes calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cct ] ) and  ( [ eq : ccv ] ) on the unphysical sheets of complex-@xmath44 riemann surface",
    ". the coupling of meson - baryon states with the resonances can be determined by the residues @xmath45 at the pole positions .",
    "our procedures for determining @xmath43 and @xmath45 and the results were presented in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "from the same bare @xmath0 state .",
    "the results are from ref .",
    "@xcite . ]    with our analytic continuation method  @xcite , we were able to analyze the dynamical origins of the nucleon resonances extracted from the considered dcc model of ref.@xcite .",
    "this was done by examining how the resonance positions move as the coupled - channels effects are gradually turned off . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : p11-traj ] for the @xmath46 states , this exercise revealed that the two poles in the roper region and the next higher pole are associated with the same bare state .",
    "spectrum are compared with 4-star ( blue bands ) and 3-star ( brown bands ) states listed by the particle data group . ]",
    "during the developing stage of dcc analysis by collaboration@xmath1ebac in 2006 - 2010 , the dcc model parameters were determined by analyzing separately the following data : @xmath47  @xcite , @xmath48  @xcite , @xmath49  @xcite , @xmath50  @xcite , and @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "the very extensive data on @xmath51 and @xmath52 production were not included in the analysis . to have a high precision extraction of nucleon resonances",
    ", it is necessary to perform a _ combined _ simultaneous coupled - channels analysis of all meson production reactions .",
    "we started an 8-channels combined analysis of _ world _ data of @xmath53 since the summer of 2010 .",
    "only the preliminary results had been obtained by march 31 , 2012 when the collaboration@xmath1ebac was dissolved . in fig.[fig : spectrum-1 ] , we show the determined excited nucleon spectrum from this combined analysis .",
    "an anl - osaka collaboration has since taken over this task and we expect to complete the analysis by the end of 2012",
    ". the anl - osaka analysis will then proceed to extracting @xmath24 form factors up to sufficiently high @xmath32 from the @xmath54 jlab data on meson electroproduction data .",
    "in addition , we will explore the interpretations of the extracted resonance parameters in terms of available hadron models , such as the dyson - schwinger - equation model and constituent quark model , and lattice qcd .",
    "this last step is needed to complete the dcc project with conclusive results , as discussed in refs.@xcite .",
