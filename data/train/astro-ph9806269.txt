    "the vast majority of the @xmath52000 known white dwarfs ( mccook and sion 1998 ) are isolated stars discovered at optical wavelengths by virtue of their photometric colours or proper motions . in either case , there is a strong bias against detecting any white dwarfs in unresolved binary systems .",
    "a companion star of type k or earlier will completely dominate the optical spectrum of the white dwarf , effectively rendering it invisible .",
    "indeed , sirius b , the first white dwarf to be discovered , would never have been resolved from the a1 dwarf sirius were it not for the close proximity of the system to earth ( 2.64pc ) .",
    "prior to the rosat and extreme ultraviolet explorer ( euve ) surveys , a small number of unresolved white dwarf / main sequence binaries had been discovered serendiptously .",
    "for example , the white dwarf in the v471 tauri system was found as a result of an eclipse by its active k2v companion .",
    "in addition , a number of white dwarfs have been accidently discovered during various far - ultraviolet ( far - uv ) observations of the normal stellar companions by the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) , e.g. @xmath6 cap ( bhm - vitense 1980 ) , 56 peg ( schindler et al . 1982 ) and 4 @xmath7@xmath8 ori ( johnson and ake 1986 ) , although shipman and geczi ( 1989 ) systematically studied the then existing iue archive for white dwarf companions to g , k and m stars , and found no further examples .    now , however , the extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) surveys of the rosat wide field camera ( wfc , pounds et al . 1993 , pye et al . 1995 ) and euve ( bowyer et al .",
    "1994 , 1996 ) have provided evidence for the existence of a substantial sample of these previously unknown white dwarfs , through the detection of euv radiation .",
    "sixteen new systems have been discovered in this way , including @xmath3 crateris ( a2iv@xmath2wd , fleming et al .",
    "1991 ) , kw aur c ( f4v@xmath2da , hodgkin et al . 1993 ) , hd18131 ( k0iv@xmath2da , vennes et al .",
    "1995 ) , re j0357@xmath2283 ( k2v@xmath2da jeffries , burleigh and robb 1996 ) , and the latest two , re j0702@xmath2129 ( k0ve@xmath2da , vennes et al .",
    "1997 ) , and hr2875 ( b5v@xmath2wd , vennes , berghoefer and christian 1997 , burleigh and barstow 1998 ) .",
    "detailed studies of groups of these objects have been undertaken by barstow et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and burleigh , barstow and fleming ( 1997 , paper i ) .",
    "positive identifications have been made in each case through follow - up observations in the far - uv with iue , since for companions later than @xmath0a5 the hot white dwarf is easily visible at these wavelengths ( the companion to the b5v star hr2875 was identified through an euve spectrum , since the b star still dominates the spectrum at far - uv wavelengths ) .",
    "it is well established that over half of all stars are members of binary or multiple systems , yet the overwhelming majority of catalogued white dwarfs are isolated objects .",
    "the new population of optically hidden white dwarfs emerging from the euv surveys has profound implications , therefore , for our knowledge of the white dwarf luminosity function , space density and formation rate ( e.g. fleming , liebert and green 1986 ) .",
    "observations of white dwarfs in detached binary systems also allow us to place constraints on their evolutionary models ( e.g. de kool and ritter 1993 ) .    in this paper",
    "we report the results of a continuing search for more of these binaries in the rosat wfc catalogue , during the final year of iue operations .",
    "we have discovered one new unresolved white dwarf@xmath2main sequence star binary ( re j0500@xmath1362 ) . in the cases where no white dwarf was detected ,",
    "a number of the target stars show evidence for chromospheric activity .",
    "we also present an analysis of the previously known white dwarf@xmath2active star system hd27483 ( bhm - vitense 1993 ) .",
    "we show that the white dwarf is contributing to the euv flux and should be included in the growing list of euv - emitting optically - hidden hot white dwarfs in binary systems .",
    "the rosat wfc euv all - sky survey was conducted between july 1990 and january 1991 .",
    "two broad band filters were utilised ( designated s1 and s2 ) , and most of the count rates quoted in this paper ( see table 1 ) are taken from the 2re catalogue ( pye et al .",
    "this revised list contains 479 euv sources , as compared with 383 in the original bright source catalogue ( pounds et al .",
    "the 2re catalogue was compiled from the original survey data with improved methods for source detection , background screening etc .",
    "the resulting count rates are equivalent to on - axis , at - launch values .",
    "the rosat pspc x - ray survey was conducted simultaneously with the wfc .",
    "the soft ( 0.1@xmath10.4kev ) and hard ( 0.4 - 2.4kev ) band count rates ( table 1 ) were obtained via the world wide web from the on - line all - sky survey bright source catalogue , maintained by the max - planck institute in germany ( voges et al . 1996 ) .",
    "all of the x - ray flux from hot white dwarfs is expected to lie within the soft band .",
    "the euve all - sky survey was conducted in four pass bands between july 1992 and january 1993 .",
    "these count rates are also given in table 1 , and are mainly taken from the second euve source catalog ( bowyer et al .",
    "1996 ) which , like the rosat wfc 2re catalogue , includes better source detection algorithms and improved reliability .",
    "hot white dwarfs in unresolved binaries with companions of spectral type k or earlier are virtually impossible to discern from optical spectra alone .",
    "however , it is possible to unambiguously identify these hidden white dwarfs in far - uv spectra taken by iue .",
    "the problem is how to select likely candidates from just their euv and soft x - ray count rates .",
    "most of the hot white dwarfs discovered by rosat have very soft spectra compared to normal stars , particularly where the interstellar hydrogen column density is low .",
    "the ratio of the wfc s2 to s1 count rates can often exceed a factor of two .",
    "additionally , no photons are usually detected from a white dwarf above the 0.28kev carbon edge of the rosat pspc .",
    "all other x - ray and euv - emitting astronomical objects generally have spectra extending to higher energies .",
    "thus , many of the stars originally selected for observation by iue were relatively bright euv sources with very similar colours to known hot white dwarfs ( e.g. kw aur c , hodgkin et al .",
    "the success rates of the early searches by , for example , barstow et al .",
    "( 1994 ) were very high , and appeared to represent the tip of an iceberg",
    ".    however , many of the white dwarfs in the rosat wfc survey are relatively faint euv sources , indistinguishable by count rate ratios alone from coronally active objects .",
    "further selection criteria , in addition to simple euv colour and brightness , needed to be applied . in paper i (",
    "burleigh , barstow and fleming 1997 ) we conducted a search for fainter , less obvious examples of these binary systems , with a @xmath040% success rate .",
    "candidates were selected , in particular , from normal stars that had been observed in the wfc optical identification programme ( mason et al .",
    "1995 ) , and where little or no evidence of activity had been found . in some cases , e.g. hd2133 ( re j0024@xmath1741 ) , a hidden white dwarf was indeed detected in an iue swp spectrum . in others , e.g. hr2468 ( re j0637@xmath1613 ) , the iue observations revealed evidence of chromospheric and coronal emission that had eluded the optical identification team .    in this paper",
    "we report the results of a further search for hidden white dwarfs during the last year of iue operations ( 1995/96 ) .",
    "thirteen candidates were selected and observed , including many that were detected for the first time in the reprocessed rosat wfc 2re data .",
    "these are , in general , faint euv sources . in most cases",
    ", the target stars were not known to be active , and had s2/s1 count rate ratios @xmath52 . in a separate optical programme ,",
    "a number of the unidentified 2re fields were observed to try to determine the counterpart to the euv source . in some cases , e.g. re j0500@xmath1364 , 2re j0222@xmath2503 and 2re j0232@xmath1025 , only one relatively faint star ( v@xmath510 ) was visible in the field .",
    "although a few euv sources ( mainly red dwarfs ) are active stars with v@xmath510 ( e.g. proxima cen , m5ve , v@xmath911.1 ) , most are much brighter than this .",
    "thus , for these sources , a hidden hot white dwarf companion was a feasible explanation for the euv radiation , and they were added to the iue target list .      a log of all the far - uv observations is given in table 2 .",
    "the white dwarf companion to hd27483 was serendipitously discovered in october 1992 by bhm - vitense ( 1993 ) , independently of the rosat survey , during an iue survey of hyades f stars .",
    "re j0500@xmath1364 was first observed in a short half - hour exposure in november 1995 ( swp56217 ) , and a faint white dwarf was detected . a follow up spectrum , with an 8 hour exposure to achieve the required signal - to - noise ,",
    "was obtained a month later .",
    "the programme was unfortunately cut short in february 1996 when a gyro failed on iue , limiting observations to objects for which a bright ( v@xmath108 ) guide star was available .",
    "this was not the case for any of our remaining targets .",
    "two spectra were affected by the so - called ` 159dn anomaly ' ( see table 2 ) .",
    "a number of pixels were assigned the flux value 159dn when they should in fact have had a higher value . however , on close inspection it was found that only a small fraction of each of these two spectra was contaminated , and their scientific usefulness was not compromised .",
    "all of the spectra have been processed with newsips ( new spectral image processing system ) .",
    "newsips spectra contain a number of significant geometrical and photometric corrections which enhance spectral signal - to - noise and improve the photometric reliability of the data ( e.g. a correction for the degradation of the detector with time , bohlin and grillmair 1988 ) .",
    "recent analysis by garhart ( 1997 ) shows that , since 1993 , the swp camera sensitivity has in fact degraded at a rate greater than predicted , so that the current newsips calibration underestimates the swp fluxes by up to 5% .",
    "archival iue data from 1993 - 96 are now being reprocessed to include a new degradation correction",
    ". however , this data was not available to us when we were preparing this paper , although we would expect the effect of the new calibration to be relatively minimal on the determination of any white dwarf parameters ( for example , the errors on the flux values for the re j0500@xmath1364 iue swp data are typically of order @xmath010% anyway ) .",
    "the method used to analyse the far - uv and euv data for the hidden white dwarfs and the active stars detected and observed during this search has been discussed in detail in paper i ( burleigh , barstow and fleming 1997 ) . a summary is given here .",
    "in binary systems like these , it is not possible to use the h balmer line profiles to measure temperature and gravity .",
    "however , the iue swp spectra can be used to estimate these parameters by matching the observed lyman @xmath11 profile and the uv continuum ( the region uncontaminated by the companion ) with synthetic spectra .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to get an unambiguous determination of t and log g from a single spectral line . instead",
    ", a range of possible models is determined by stepping through values of the surface gravity , from log g@xmath97.0 to 9.0 , and finding the best fit temperature and normalisation at each point .",
    "we compare the observed far - uv data with fully line blanketed , homogeneously mixed h@xmath2he , lte model atmospheres , spanning a temperature range from 20,000k to 100,000k , and kindly supplied by detlev koester ( e.g. koester 1991 ) . in this analysis",
    ", we assume the white dwarfs have pure hydrogen envelopes .",
    "the spectral fitting is conducted with the xspec programme ( schafer et al .",
    "1991 ) , which calculates a chi - squared statistic for the fit between the data and the model , and which is then minimised by incremental steps in the free parameters .",
    "there is no need to take into account any interstellar component in the analysis of the lyman @xmath11 profile , because for columns greater than a few @xmath1210@xmath13 the white dwarf is unlikely to be detected in euv surveys .",
    "the white dwarf radius and mass are calculated using the temperature - dependent evolutionary models of wood ( 1995 ) , which assume thick ( 10@xmath14m@xmath15 ) h layers , and the radii are then used to estimate the distance from the model normalisation parameter ( which is actually the solid angle of the star , equivalent to [ radius / distance]@xmath16 ) .",
    "the distances to the primaries in each case can be calculated from the spectral type and v magnitude , and are given in table 3 .",
    "the range of white dwarf temperatures and gravities that give the best match to the distance of the primary can then be estimated .",
    "the v magnitude of each white dwarf is estimated from the model flux at 5500 , and given in table 5 .",
    "once the temperature and gravity of each white dwarf has been estimated , the rosat euv and soft x - ray fluxes can give an indication of the level of photospheric opacity in the stellar atmosphere , by comparing them with predicted values for a pure h model .",
    "the rosat data is fitted independently from the iue data since contamination from elements heavier than h and he only has an effect at euv and soft x - ray wavelengths .",
    "we fit the data from the two wfc filters , and the integrated count rate in the 0.1@xmath10.28 kev pspc band , within which all the white dwarf soft x - ray flux is expected to lie .",
    "it is possible that some euv and x - ray emission might also originate from the normal stars in each system .",
    "any detected pspc flux at energies above 0.4 kev is an indication of the presence of an active companion ( table 6 ) .",
    "once again we utilise detlev koester s fully line blanketed h@xmath2he models .",
    "these assume a homogenous distribution of hydrogen and helium , under lte conditions , in the range @xmath18@xmath10loghe / h@xmath10@xmath13 .",
    "the temperature , gravity and normalisation , estimated from the fit to the iue data , are frozen during the modelling , but the he / h ratio is allowed to vary .",
    "the interstellar hi column density is also estimated by assuming that the local ism is not highly ionised ( i.e. there is minimal heii absorption ) and that the hei / h ratio is cosmic ( 0.1 ) .    the fitting is again conducted using the xspec programme .",
    "we consider a good fit to the data to correspond to the probability that a particular value of the reduced @xmath17@xmath16 ( @xmath17@xmath18@xmath16 ) can occur by chance to be 0.1 or greater ( i.e. 90% confidence ) , and a bad fit 0.01 or less ( 99% confidence ) .",
    "the fits in between might not be very good , but can not be ruled out with high confidence . in this analysis",
    "a good fit requires @xmath17@xmath18@xmath16@xmath102.71 , but until it exceeds 6.63 a model can not be excluded with any certainty .",
    "consequently , we list all model fits to the data for which @xmath17@xmath18@xmath16@xmath106.63 ( table 6 ) .      a number of the stars observed with iue where no white dwarf was detected are probably coronally and chromospherically active .",
    "some of these stars are also comparatively hard x - ray sources ( i.e. they are detected in the 0.4@xmath12.4 kev band of the rosat pspc ) , and in some of the iue lwp spectra chromospheric mgii emission was seen at 2798 .    in these cases ,",
    "estimates of the l@xmath19/l@xmath20 and l@xmath21/l@xmath20 ratios have been made as an indicator of the level of activity ( table 7 ) .",
    "we adopt the methods outlined by jeffries ( 1995 ) and fleming et al .",
    "( 1995 ) to estimate these parameters .    where chromospheric mgii emission was seen the line fluxes above the continuum level were measured using a simple gaussian profile , fitted to each line , after the continuum had first been subtracted ( the continuum flux was represented by a low degree polynomial ) .",
    "note that in each case the mgii emission actually fills - in an underlying absorption dip .",
    "however , it is impossible to estimate the depth of this absorption line , and thus the measurements presented here are only lower limits .",
    "the measured mgii fluxes are listed in table 7 , and have been used to estimate l@xmath22/l@xmath20 .",
    "the field of this euv source ( see figure 1 ) was surveyed by mason et al .",
    "( 1995 ) during the wfc optical identification programme .",
    "no evidence of activity was found in the cores of ca ii h & k in the spectrum of a @xmath013th magnitude star located at the centre of the source error box .",
    "various stars were also examined outside the error box , but none could plausibly account for the euv emission . the field was also examined on 1995 september 29/30 with the 2.3 m steward observatory telescope on kitt peak , as part of a programme to search for the optical counterparts to unidentified sources in the rosat wfc 2re catalogue .",
    "a spectrum ( figure 2 ) of the central star in the source error box was obtained with the boller and chivens spectrometer and 800@xmath121200 blue sensitive ccd . a 2.5 \" slit and",
    "600 lines / mm grating blazed at 3658 were used , and the data were reduced with standard iraf routines .",
    "again , there was no evidence for activity .",
    "one untested proposition was that this central object could be hiding a hot white dwarf companion .",
    "therefore , the star was added to our iue target list for observations during 1995/96 , and a faint , @xmath418th magnitude hot white dwarf companion was discovered ( figure 3 ) .    by comparing the relative line strengths and widths of the primary s optical spectrum with spectra in the atlas of jacoby , hunter and christian ( 1984 ) ,",
    "we conclude that it most closely resembles an f6/7v .",
    "it should be noted that the spectrum appears to be deficient in flux at the blue end , below @xmath04500 .",
    "as the star was observed at a relatively high air mass ( sec z@xmath92.94 ) , this deficiency in counts was probably caused by differential atmospheric dispersion .",
    "the spectral identification is strengthened when the iue lwp spectrum ( lwp31729 , figure 4 ) is compared to spectra in the iue spectral atlas ( wu et al .",
    "the data are very noisy , and have been binned up as a consequence , but most closely match stars in the range f5v@xmath1g0v .",
    "there also appears to be a slight excess of flux in the iue swp spectrum , at wavelengths @xmath51850 , above the level expected from the white dwarf ( figure 3 ) .",
    "if the excess is real , then it must attributable to the primary . as @xmath013th magnitude mid - late g and k stars",
    "are not bright enough to be detected by iue in this region of the spectrum , this also indicates that the companion is probably a late f. taking the guide star catalogue magnitude of v@xmath913.29 , the system lies between 755 ( f7v ) and 870 ( f6v ) parsecs away , although if we consider possible errors on the gsc magnitude ( @xmath230.3 mags ) , and that the absolute magnitudes may be in error by up to @xmath230.5 magnitudes , the system could be as close as 520 parsecs or as distant as 1250 parsecs .",
    "is this a true binary or a chance alignment ? given that the source of the euv radiation is almost certainly the hot white dwarf , we can calculate the probability of a random 13th magnitude star also falling within the iue aperture . according to allen ( 1973 ) ,",
    "the number of stars per square degree at the galactic latitude of re j0500@xmath1364 , brighter than v@xmath913 , is 87.1 .",
    "the iue large aperture is a 10``@xmath1220 '' oval , hence we calculate a probability of @xmath41/250 of a chance alignment .",
    "( note that the point spread function of the stellar image of the 13th magnitude star on the digitised sky survey plate is @xmath015 \" in radius , see figure 1 ) .    assuming this is indeed a true binary ,",
    "then we believe re j0500@xmath1364 to be one of the most distant white dwarfs , if not the most distant , to be identified in the euv surveys ( for a comparison , see the distance estimates for the white dwarfs detected by the rosat pspc by fleming et al . 1996 , and those detected by euve by vennes et al .",
    ".    a model fit to the iue spectrum at log g@xmath97.25 gives t@xmath938,260k and m@xmath90.40m@xmath15 , corresponding to a distance of 830 parsecs .",
    "a fit at log g@xmath98.0 corresponds to the minimum distance estimate to the system , but gives a higher mass , m@xmath90.68m@xmath15 and higher temperature , t@xmath945,000k ( and brings the star into the regime where its atmosphere may be contaminated by elements heavier then he ) .",
    "the inferred v magnitude from these models is 17.9 , making this one of the faintest white dwarfs to be detected by rosat .",
    "the faintest , re j0616@xmath1649 ( v@xmath918.4 ) , is a rare magnetic da ( jordan 1997 ) , but there are few other hot white dwarfs detected fainter than 17th magnitude .",
    "this source is not included in the rosat pspc all - sky survey bright source catalogue ( voges et al .",
    "1996 ) , but it has been observed and detected in x - rays during a pointed observation by the rosat high resolution imager ( hri ) . the target was observed as part of programme to identify possible isolated neutron star candidates in the rosat surveys ( pi wang ) . using the point source search programme ( pss ) within the starlink asterix x - ray analysis package ( see pye et al .",
    "1995 ) to analyse the hri image , the position of the x - ray source was found to be coincident with the wfc and euve detections ( figure 1 ) , and has a flux of 27.4@xmath233.9 counts per 1000 sec@xmath24 .",
    "the source shows no evidence for time variability .",
    "although the hri has very limited spectral response ( the spectral properties of the hri are known to vary with detector position and time in an ill - defined manner ) , it is possible to obtain a crude hardness ratio . in this case , the hri data can then be used to test whether there is any hard x - ray emission from the f6/7v companion star , since no emission is expected from the white dwarf photosphere above 0.4 kev .",
    "figure 5 shows the hri data plotted as a function of pulse height distribution .",
    "the exact energy of each channel varies temporarily and spatially , but channels 1 to 5 are roughly equivalent to the soft ( 0.1@xmath10.4 kev ) pspc band , and channels 6@xmath116 are equivalent to the hard ( 0.4@xmath12.4 kev ) band . as with the pspc",
    ", a hardness ratio can be defined by ( hard@xmath1soft)/(hard@xmath2soft ) . in this case , the hardness ratio @xmath9@xmath11.0 confirming , as can be readily seen in figure 5 , that this is a very soft source .",
    "we conclude that all of the euv and soft x - ray emission originates from the hot white dwarf .",
    "unfortunately , there is no reliable detector matrix for the hri , and it did not prove possible to use the x - ray count rate in the subsequent analysis .",
    "therefore , since this left only the two rosat wfc data points to try to constrain the interstellar hydrogen column density and white dwarf atmospheric parameters , we assumed that the white dwarf photosphere was essentially pure hydrogen ( a reasonable assumption for t@xmath1040,000k , and for many hot das t@xmath1050,000k ) , and allowed only the neutral hydrogen column density to vary in the subsequent fitting of the euv data .",
    "we found that the wfc s2 photometric data point is well matched by a model fit at log g@xmath97.25 , although the s1 flux was predicted to be slightly lower than observed .",
    "the hydrogen column density given by this model is n@xmath25@xmath97.5@xmath1210@xmath26 atoms @xmath27 . at 830 parsecs distance ,",
    "this translates into a neutral hydrogen line - of - sight volume density of only 0.0029 atoms @xmath28 , well below the average local volume density within @xmath080pc of the sun of 0.05 atoms @xmath28 ( warwick et al .",

    "although an euv source was detected originating from the direction of this system in the rosat wfc all sky survey in 1990 , the hot white dwarf component was identified independently and serendipitously by bhm - vitense ( 1993 ) during an iue swp observation as part of a survey of hyades f stars ( bhm - vitense 1995 ) .",
    "bhm - vitense ( 1993 ) derived atmospheric parameters for the white dwarf of 23000@xmath231000k and m@xmath90.6m@xmath15 .",
    "however , in the analysis of the white dwarf spectrum the author utilised the unblanketed models of wesemael et al . ( 1980 ) , assuming log g@xmath98.0 , to fit the far - uv spectrum at just two points .",
    "since the white dwarf might be hot enough to be contributing to the observed euv flux , it could be argued that the system should be included on the list of euv - detected hidden white dwarfs , and thus we have decided to re - analyse the far - uv and rosat data here , in the same manner as the other recently discovered systems .",
    "the rosat wfc source re j0420@xmath2138 , associated with hd27483 , was listed in the original bright source catalogue ( pounds et al .",
    "1993 ) , with a count rate of 15.0@xmath234.0 counts ksec@xmath24 ( it was not detected in s2 ) , but was not subsequently detected in the reprocessed 2re survey ( pye et al .",
    "the significance of the s1 detection in the 2re survey was 4.2 ; sources had to exceed a significance of 5.5 in a combination of both bands to be included in the catalogue .",
    "even so , at t@xmath423,000k the white dwarf may be contributing to this small euv flux , despite the fact that the two f star companions are known to be active themselves .",
    "there is significant contamination in the iue swp spectrum ( see figure 6 ) at the long wavelength end from the two f6v star companions , but this falls to zero by 1600 .",
    "therefore , we were able to use the continuum flux up to this point",
    ". bhm - vitense estimated a distance of 47.6 parsecs to this system .",
    "we can further constrain this figure with the recently published _ hipparcos _",
    "parallaxes ( esa 1997 ) , where the measured value for hd27483 is 21.8@xmath230.85mas , corresponding to a distance of 45.9@xmath21.80@xmath33@xmath11.75 parsecs . the spectral model which best matches this distance has log g@xmath98.5 and t@xmath922,000 , and the corresponding stellar mass is m@xmath90.94m@xmath15 .",
    "the white dwarf age is then 1.4@xmath1210@xmath34 years , in comparison with the age of the hyades cluster , @xmath07@xmath1210@xmath34 years ( bhm - vitense 1993 ) .",
    "given that the white dwarf might have a higher mass than is the average for these stars ( @xmath40.6m@xmath15 , marsh et al .",
    "1997 ) , we can estimate its progenitor mass and place a possible lower limit on the maximum mass for white dwarf progenitor stars in the hyades cluster . from wood ( 1992 ) :    @xmath35@xmath9aexp(b@xmath12@xmath36 )    where  a@xmath90.49462m@xmath15 and b@xmath90.09468m@xmath15@xmath24 .",

    "the main sequence lifetime of a 6.7m@xmath15 star is in fact significantly shorter than 560 million years ( the difference between the hyades age and the white dwarf cooling age , e.g. schaller et al . 1992 ) .",
    "this suggests that the white dwarf is , in reality , probably lower in mass than 0.94m@xmath15 .",
    "however , in order to unambiguously and tightly constrain the fundamental parameters of this star , we will need to obtain a spectrum of the h lyman series with an instrument such as the forthcoming _ fuse _ mission ( see also section 6 ) .",
    "the wfc source is coincident with a rosat pspc x - ray source , with a total count rate of 130.6@xmath2319.8 counts ksec@xmath24 , including a detection in the upper band .",
    "this confirms that at least one of the two f6v companion stars is active , as the hard x - rays could not have originated from the white dwarf .",
    "the rosat data points can not be matched with any of the white dwarf models ( which assume a homogeneous atmospheric mixture of h and he ) .",
    "this implies that the active star(s ) must be providing a significant fraction of the euv flux , since little or no heavy element contamination is expected in the white dwarf photosphere in this cool temperature regime .",
    "it is even possible that there is no flux at all from the white dwarf at these wavelengths .",
    "the contribution of the white dwarf to the s1 count rate can , however , be estimated .",
    "another hot wd@xmath2ms binary , v471 tauri , is detected by rosat in the hyades cluster ( barstow et al .",

    "this hot degenerate companion to hd27483 could itself , then , be regarded as a real euv source . at t@xmath422,000k , this would make it one of the coolest white dwarfs to be detected in the euv surveys .",

    "the euv to mg ii flux ratio ( @xmath48.0 ) strongly suggests that this star is active and the true source of the euv radiation .",

    ", this is a relatively bright euv source in comparison with most of the targets in this paper . the soft x - ray and euv photometric colours",

    "( 1995 ) report that this fainter object is indeed active , although they give no indication of the size of any emission features seen in the optical .",

    "the true euv source remains unclear , and the suspicion remains that there is indeed an unresolved hot white dwarf hiding in this field .",
    "it is highly unusual to detect an a star in euv or x - ray surveys ( fleming et al .",
    "observations by the einstein and exosat observatories failed to find any convincing detections other than the nearby quadruple a star system castor ( pallavicini et al .",
    "therefore hr4646 , an am star coincident with rosat wfc 2re and pspc sources , was selected as a potential hidden white dwarf binary .",
    "it should be noted that am stars do not possess significant magnetic fields and they are slow rotators , but they almost always appear to lie in close binary systems ( abt 1961 ) , and indeed margoni , munari and stagni ( 1992 ) found that hr4646 is a spectroscopic binary with a period of 1.27 days .",
    "the iue swp spectrum ( figure 15 ) shows no evidence for a hot white dwarf companion .",
    "it is extremely likely , therefore , that hr4646 has a coronally active cooler companion ( f5 or later ) .",
    "a search for unresolved white dwarfs in binary systems with optically brighter normal stellar companions has been conducted with iue during its final year of operation .",
    "targets were chosen among the fainter and still un - identified euv sources in the rosat 2re catalogue ( pye et al .",
    "one new system was discovered ( re j0500@xmath1364 , da@xmath2f6/7v ) , which appears to lie in a direction of low interstellar neutral hydrogen volume density .",
    "if this star is really as distant as @xmath0500 - 1000pc , then it may represent a lower limit to the size of the @xmath3  cma tunnel of low density neutral gas stretching away from the local bubble in that direction .    including the independently identified hd27483 ( da@xmath2f6v , bhm - vitense 1993 )",
    ", this new discovery brings the total number of such systems found in the rosat and euve surveys to nineteen .",
    "these two satellites have , therefore , been very successful in helping us to identify these kinds of binary systems , which have never been seen optically and could only have been identified through such satellite surveys",
    ". however , these stars still represent @xmath1020% of the hot white dwarfs identified in the euv .    the demise of iue , which suffered a gyro failure in february 1996 , limiting it to observe only targets with bright guide stars ( the mission was finally terminated in september 1996 ) , effectively cut short our programme .",
    "the loss of iue means that this particular method of searching for these important systems is no longer available .",
    "although hst can observe the same wavelength region , it is of course much harder to obtain the time required for this kind of search .",
    "it is likely , therefore , that very few new examples of these systems will be discovered in the near future .",
    "the results presented in this paper seem to suggest that this search , using the euv catalogues as a basis from which to identify potential systems , has been fairly exhaustive ( we have identified only one new system from thirteen targets ) .    however , the identification by vennes et al .",
    "( 1997 ) of a hot white dwarf companion to a previously catalogued euv - bright active star , re j0702@xmath2129 ( k0ve ) , instead suggests that , in fact , some systems may have been completely overlooked .",
    "re j0702@xmath2129 was classified as active by mason et al .",
    "( 1995 ) in their optical follow - up programme to identify the euv sources found in the rosat wfc survey , and was not , therefore , included on any of our target lists for the iue search .",
    "this raises the question of how many of the @xmath5200 ` active ' stars in the wfc and euve catalogues really are the source , or at least the only source , of the euv radiation . until each star has been observed and analysed in detail",
    ", the suspicion remains that there are more of these binary systems in the survey waiting to be identified .",
    "for example , the rosat wfc catalogue includes @xmath4120 isolated white dwarfs , and @xmath460 in some kind of binary , e.g. classic sirius - type systems , cvs , non - interacting da@xmath2 dm systems , and visual binaries .",
    "conservatively , then , we might assume that we have already identified the majority of the white dwarf binaries to be found in the survey .",
    "however , if as many as 80% of stars reside in binary or multiple systems , another 30 might be awaiting discovery .",
    "these could include double degenerate systems as well as further examples of sirius - type systems ( e.g. the apparantly isolated da re j0512@xmath1007 has a mass , m@xmath90.38m@xmath15 , too low for it to be the result of single star evolution , and may have a degenerate companion ) .",
    "what is really needed to try to find more sirius - type binaries is an all - sky uv survey .",
    "none has been undertaken since the td-1 survey of 1972/73 , which originally appeared to have only detected sirius b among these systems .",
    "subsequently , though , landsman , simon and bergeron ( 1996 ) found white dwarf companions to 56 persei and hr3643 as a result of the uv excess detected by td-1 .",
    "the recently approved _ galex _ mission ( bianchi 1998 ) , which will survey the sky at uv wavelengths and follow - up some targets spectroscopically , may reveal many more of these binaries .    in the meantime , follow - up observations of these nineteen new euv - bright systems are required .",
    "in particular , it is important to determine whether these systems are wide , or close enough that they must have undergone common envelope evolution .",
    "this information will help to place constraints on theoretical models of binary evolution ( e.g. de kool and ritter 1993 ) .",
    "detailed studies of the normal stellar companions may also reveal evidence of past interaction ( e.g. jeffries and stevens 1996 ) , and stars with possible abundance anomalies that may be the progenitors of the barium and carbon giants ( e.g. jeffries and smalley 1996 ) .",
    "in addition , the forthcoming _ fuse _ mission ( far ultra - violet spectroscopic explorer ) will , for the first time , allow us to unambiguously determine the temperatures and surface gravities of the white dwarfs in these systems ( and hence their masses and radii ) , through modelling of the h lyman absorption series down to 912 .",

    "<S> the rosat wide field camera ( wfc ) survey of the extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) has provided us with evidence for the existence of a previously unidentified sample of hot white dwarfs in unresolved , detached binary systems . </S>",
    "<S> these stars are invisible at optical wavelengths due to the close proximity of their much more luminous companions ( spectral type k or earlier ) . however , for companions of spectral type @xmath0a5 or later the white dwarfs are easily visible at far - ultraviolet ( far - uv ) wavelengths , and can be identified in spectra taken by iue . </S>",
    "<S> sixteen such systems have been discovered in this way through rosat , euve and iue observations , including four identified by us in paper i ( burleigh , barstow and fleming 1997 ) . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we report the results of our continuing search during the final year of iue operations . </S>",
    "<S> one new system , re j0500@xmath1364 ( da@xmath2f6/7v ) , has been identified . </S>",
    "<S> this star appears to lie at a distance of between @xmath0500@xmath11000pc , making it one of the most distant white dwarfs , if not the most distant , to be detected in the euv surveys . </S>",
    "<S> the very low line - of - sight neutral hydrogen volume density to this object could place a lower limit on the length of the @xmath3  cma interstellar tunnel of diffuse gas , which stretches away from the local bubble in a similar direction to re j0500@xmath1364 .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we also analyse a number of the stars observed where no white dwarf companion was found . </S>",
    "<S> some of these objects show evidence for chromospheric and coronal activity . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we present an analysis of the previously known wd@xmath2active f6v binary hd27483 ( bhm - vitense 1993 ) , and show that , at t@xmath422,000k , the white dwarf may be contributing significantly to the observed euv flux . </S>",
