    "we consider the problem of recovering the electrical conductivity of a body from partial interior measurements of one current density field generated by an imposed boundary voltage . originally , one sought to recover the conductivity solely from boundary measurements .",
    "most generally formulated by caldern @xcite , the problem has been extensively studied : the unique determination results @xcite are known to have weak ( of logarithmic type ) stability estimates @xcite , which can not be , in general , improved @xcite . the need for determining the conductivity by more robust methods has lead to considering new problems in the conductivity imaging , which employ some interior data .",
    "such interior knowledge is obtained by coupling the electromagnetic model with the physics of some high resolution imaging method .",
    "for example , magnetic resonance measurements are employed in @xcite to determine ( one component ) of the magnetic field inside , or in @xcite to obtain the current density field inside , whereas ultrasound measurements are employed in @xcite to obtain the interior knowledge of power densities ; see @xcite for some recent reviews .    this work concerns the problem of stability in determining the conductivity from partial knowledge of one current density inside .",
    "the interior data can be obtained from magnetic resonance measurements as discovered in @xcite . a first attempt to image",
    "the conductivity from the interior data of current density fields goes back to @xcite .",
    "since then several mathematical methods have been proposed , see @xcite for the isotropic case , and @xcite for the anisotropic case .    of interest here ,",
    "the work in @xcite shows that interior knowledge of the magnitude of one current density field generated by an imposed boundary voltage uniquely determine the conductivity inside .",
    "a general approach in @xcite shows that using multiple measurements ( two in the planar case ) the linearized problem is stable , up to a finite dimensional kernel .",
    "stability for the linear and non - linear problem from knowledge of the magnitude of one current density field was proved in @xcite .",
    "the second author would like to point out a small omission in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.2 ) , were the assumption that the voltage potentials must be equal at the boundary needs to be added .",
    "this is a natural assumption and it was clearly used in equation ( 21 ) in there , but unfortunately omitted in the final version of the paper .",
    "when the entire current density field is known , a stability result has been obtained in @xcite . for the anisotropic conductivities we mention the work in @xcite which a proved stability in two dimensions from full knowledge of four current density fields .",
    "all these stability results assume perturbations within the range of the data , locally near a given conductivity .",
    "if one assumes general perturbations in the interior data , the recent uniqueness result in @xcite combined with the structural stability in @xcite shows that the voltage potential can still be stably recovered inside .",
    "however , the class of smoothness is insufficient to further yield stability for the conductivity .    in the case of partial interior data ,",
    "unique determination of planar conductivity have been showed to be possible in certain subdomains ( see the _ injectivity region _ defined below ) in @xcite , but the stability question has been left open . while the voltage potential can be stably recovered in certain subregions from partial interior data the stability estimates obtained in @xcite do not guarantee the necessary regularity to extend to estimates for the conductivity .",
    "in this paper we assume that knowledge of the current density field is only partially available inside .",
    "in fact we will show that knowledge of a certain component of the field suffices .",
    "we identify the specific subregions where conductivity can be stably recovered from partial interior and boundary data .",
    "the boundary voltage potential imposed to generate the current density field is assumed unperturbed , but need not be known everywhere . in general the stability region is a subset of the injectivity region as illustrated in figure [ fig : visible - region - non - connected ] .",
    "however , if the accessible part of the boundary ( where the voltage potential is known ) is simply connected , then the injectivity region and the stability region coincide under some geometric ( strict convexity ) assumptions on the shape of the boundary .",
    "different from the work in @xcite we use a non - linear version of the decomposition of the data operator and identify a natural component of the current density field sufficient to yield stability . to authors knowledge , this is the first result where either injectivity or stability is established from knowledge of just one component of the current density .",
    "the required component depends both on the measured and on the exact data .",
    "similar to all the works in the hybrids methods , we also work with voltages free of singular points inside the domain . in dimension two",
    ", the condition of no critical points can be satisfied under the assumption that the boundary illumination is almost two - to - one @xcite . in dimensions",
    "@xmath0 , it is still unclear if similar conditions exists ; the recent results in @xcite describing the set of singular points assume nonzero frequencies .",
