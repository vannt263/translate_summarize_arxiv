    "recent development of quantum groups @xcite has resulted in the construction of @xmath0-analogs of quite a few quantum systems including a very popular system that is the harmonic oscillator .",
    "a @xmath0-analog realization of harmonic oscillator has been given by macfarlane@xcite and biedenharn@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite coherent analogs of glauber states have also been proposed .",
    "it is of great interest to use these quantum analog formulations to study physical systems and there are situations where a description in terms of @xmath0- analog structures is apparently more natural .",
    "the case of an atom being cooled through interaction with the radiation offers an interesting case study .",
    "it has been shown @xcite recently that the atom can be cooled down to energies very close to it s zero point vibrational energy . at these energies",
    "the quantum effects due to center of mass motion of the atom are expected to be very important@xcite .",
    "blockley et .",
    "al.@xcite have studied the collapses and revivals of population inversion in a single two - level atom interacting with a classical single mode travelling light field while constrained to move in a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator trap .",
    "they also discuss the possibility of observing the collapses and revivals experimentally .",
    "the interaction of the atom with the trap potential results in energy exchange between the internal degrees of freedom of the atom and the center of mass motion . as the atom slows down , the amount of energy exchanged in each step of the cooling process is not expected to be constant but a variable dependent on the initial energy state of the atomic center of mass .",
    "presently we study the time evolution of a two - level atom in a @xmath0-deformed harmonic oscillator trap , in interaction with a single mode travelling light field . in a @xmath0-deformed harmonic oscillator trap ,",
    "the energy spacing between the trap states , as seen by the atom , is a function of the initial vibrational state of the atom . as such , when there is a lot of energy associated with center of mass motion energy loss and gain occurs in large energy quanta .",
    "however as the atom cools down , the energy exchange takes place in smaller units of energy . besides that the relative energy separation between successive states is determined by the value of the deformation parameter .",
    "blockley et al@xcite have shown that in the lamb - dicke regime , when only the interaction between nearest neighbours is significant the model is similar to the jaynes - cummings model(jcm)@xcite with trap quanta playing a role similar to that of the light quanta in jcm . an atom with its center of mass in a coherent trap state initially , shows collapses and revivals of its population inversion .",
    "our object is to investigate the system response for a trap potential expected to be closer to experimental situation in comparoson with a harmonic oscillator trap .",
    "the energy spacings between energy eigen states of the @xmath0-analog harmonic oscillator are not constant but are a function of @xmath0-deformation . as such for a given system a suitable choice of the deformation parameter can take us from the classical limit where the trap states are closely spaced to the lamb- dicke regime with well spaced trap states . in our earlier attempts",
    "@xcite to understand the physical nature of deformation in the context of pairing of nucleons , it has been found that the deformation amounts to simulating the nonlinearities of the problem or part of the interaction not included in the hamiltionian . with these results in mind",
    "we expect the -atom in @xmath0 deformed oscillator trap model- to be a better description of the physical situation involved .",
    "consider a single two level atom having atomic transition frequency@xmath3 in a quantized @xmath0-analog quantum harmonic oscillator trap(@xmath0-deformed harmonic oscillator trap ) interacting with a single mode travelling light field .",

    "we note that the trap states are not evenly spaced , the energy spacing being a function of deformation . besides that as we move up in the number of vibrational quanta in the states the spacing between successive states increases . for a given region of vibrational states",
    "a suitable choice of deformation parameter should correspond to the lamb dicke regime .",
    "the hamiltonian for the system that consists the atom vibrating in the trap and interacting with a classical single - mode light field of frequency @xmath24 is given by@xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 , is the detuning parameter and @xmath27 is the rabi frequency of the system .",

    "the second term in the hamiltonian refers to the energy associated with internal degrees of freedom of the atom , whereas the third term is the interaction of the atom with the light field . for nonzero values of deformation parameter @xmath0 , the kinetic energy and potential energy of the atom in the trap",
    "are a function of deformation .",

    "as pointed out in ref.@xcite , the effective rabi frequency for trapping model can be easily calculated in the lowest approximation . in a similar way , considering only those transitions involving single trap quantum exchange we can easily calculate the analog of the effective rabi frequency in the deformed harmonic oscillator trap . in case the driving field is tuned to the first vibrational sideband , @xmath53 all other transitions can be neglected if these are oscillating at sufficiently high frequencies . for @xmath54 ,",
    "the rotating wave approximation can be used and the dynamical equations solved to give the eigenvalues and the effective rabi frequency . in ref.@xcite",
    "the effective rabi frequency obtained is @xmath55 for the @xmath0-deformed oscillator trap the effective frequency , to first order in @xmath51 , is a function of deformation given by @xmath56 + \\delta]^2 + \\omega ^2\\epsilon ^2[m+1]_q}.$ ]",
    "the initial state center of mass motion of the atom is represented by @xmath0-analog glauber coherent state(gcs ) , while the atom is in the ground state .",

    "in figures ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we plot the population inversion as a function of redefined time parameter @xmath61 for @xmath62 with @xmath63 taking real values 0.0 , 0.002 , 0.003 , 0.004 , 0.006 , 0.01 and 0.1 respectively . besides that we also use the parameter values @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "for @xmath66 the results obtained by blockley et .",
    "al.@xcite are reproduced , when a harmonic oscillator trap is used and mean number of trap quanta is @xmath67 . in the numerical calculation the maximum value of m in eq.([psi ] ) is restricted to @xmath68 . in fig.(1 ) for @xmath69 , the first revival is seen to peak earlier than the one for @xmath66 and a well defined collapse appears between the first and the second revival . for a very small value of @xmath70",
    "the collapse and revival pattern is seen to become much more pronounced(well defined ) as compared to the undeformed case .",
    "however as the deformation is increased to @xmath71 and @xmath72 , the pattern again becomes diffuse after the first revival .",
    "the time interval after which the first revival occurs is seen to become shorter as @xmath73 is increased as seen in fig.(2 ) .",
    "another interesting feature of the collapses and revivals is that as the deformation increases the collapse period of the system is seen to exhibit increasing level of coherent population trapping . for a large deformation ,",
    "that in the context of this system is something like @xmath74 , the time dependence of popuation inversion is considerably washed away . for still larger values of @xmath73 for example @xmath75 in fig.(2 ) no time dependence of the system is seen anymore .",
    "similar results are obtained when imaginary values of the parameter @xmath63 are used .",
    "it is expected because for very small deformations the values of @xmath12_q$ ] for @xmath76 with @xmath63 real are very close to the values of @xmath12_q$ ] for @xmath77 imaginary so long as the modulus of @xmath63 is the same .    to obtain further insight into the energy exchange between the atomic center of mass motion and the internal degrees of freedom of the atom",
    ", we calculate the quasi - probability distributions in the @xmath78 plane .",
    "the quasi - probability or q - function is defined as @xmath79 , @xmath80 being the density matrix reduced for degrees of freedom of center of mass motion .",
    "figure ( 3 ) shows in the upperv part the time evolution of q - function for zero deformation at @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively .",
    "starting with the center of mass initial state as a coherent state @xmath83 , the initially single peaked q - function splits into two peaked function counterrotating in the complex plane . at @xmath84 ,",
    "when two peaks collide a revival of inversion oscillation occurs . a similar plot for @xmath85",
    "is shown for @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively .",
    "an interesting feature of the q - function for @xmath85 is the presence of as many as five peaks at @xmath88 .",
    "a sequenece of q - function distributions , for @xmath89 and @xmath90 shows the spreading out and breaking up of the quasi - probability into as many as eight distinct peaks(for @xmath91 .",
    "the revival of rabi- oscillations occurs when all peaks collide together into a single peak at @xmath92 .",
    "we also plot in fig.(3 ) the q - function for @xmath93 at @xmath94 again showing as many as seven peaks .",
    "it is apparent that when trap potential is q - deformed the quasi - probability distribution is no longer symmetrically distributed about @xmath95 line.this asymmetry is a manifestation of unequal energy spacings between different trap states .",
    "this calculation shows that in a q - deformed oscillator trap for a suitable deformation the collapse and revival patterns become well defined .",
    "as proposed by blockley at el.@xcite the theoretical predictions in this case can be verified experimentally . from our earlier work@xcite with physical systems",
    "we may conjecture that the deformation corresponds to the presence of some nonlinearitis in the trapping potential . in this case small scale nonlinearities",
    "are expected to play a beneficial role facilitating experimental observation . but large nonlinearities can wash out the collapse and revival pattern completely .",
    "this result is very important for constructing -an atom in a trap system- with a high probability for observing collapses and revivals of population inversion .    in the study of interaction of a three level atom with radiation in ref",
    "@xcite it is shown that by preparing the atom in a special way the time dependent collapses and revivals are either greatly diminished or vanish all together .",
    "the initial preparation forces the atomic population to remain coherently trapped in this configuration .",
    "apparently @xmath0-deformed initial state is similar to a dressed atomic states .",
    "we may conclude therefore that the nonlinearities of the trapping potential lead to effects similar to those obtained by setting initial atomic state amplitudes to selected values .    in ref.@xcite collapses and revivals",
    "have been studied for jcm with an intensity dependent coupling constant by using @xmath0-analog of harmonic oscillator to represent the radiation quanta . in their calculation the collapses and revivals are seen to become more diffuse as the deformation is increased .",
    "our result is different from theirs in the sense that the collapses and revivals become well defined .",
    "the major difference in their calculation and ours is that they use the zero order hamiltonian to be a harmonic oscillator hamiltonian whereas we have explicitely included the zero order spectrum of @xmath0-analog oscillator .",
