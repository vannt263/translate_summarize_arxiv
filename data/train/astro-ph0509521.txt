    "dynamical studies indicate the presence of dark matter ( dm ) around spiral galaxies @xcite , and the dm mass profile has been measured through the rotation velocity profile . on the other hand , random motions of stars and clouds did not allow us to determine accurately the mass profile in elliptical galaxies .",
    "alternatively , x - ray distribution of a hot interstellar medium ( ism ) traces the gravitational potential @xcite , and , using rosat and asca satellites , it is revealed that massive dm halo exists around x - ray bright giant elliptical galaxies at ( 510)@xmath1 , where @xmath1 is an effective radius or optical half - light radius @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations based on cold cark matter ( cdm ) predict the cusp structure of the density profile @xcite , whose shape is well scaled for various systems from small galaxies to rich clusters .",
    "the dm halo structure is sensitive to the properties of the dm , and attention of many workers is now focussed on the inner slope of the dm density profile .",
    "dm profile of galaxy clusters measured with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ has been reported to be consistent with the cdm picture @xcite .",
    "however , the mass profile around the optical body of elliptical galaxies has not been constrained , since the previous x - ray observations could not measure the brightness and temperature profile at the inner region of galaxies .",
    "in addition , there is still a lack of information on dm content in x - ray faint elliptical galaxies .",
    "recently , several other techniques become available to probe the mass profile around elliptical galaxies : strong gravitational lensing @xcite at 110@xmath1 of distant galaxies , and kinematics of stars , nearby dwarfs , and planetary nebula @xcite at ( 0.15)@xmath1 .",
    "these observations revealed that the mass - to - light ratio is almost constant at 330 around with radius of ( 0.55)@xmath1 , and possibly correlates with the optical luminosity .",
    "analyses of the einstein and rosat hri data derived a mass profile of x - ray bright elliptical gaiaxies down to @xmath8 , and confirmed that the innermost mass profile from x - ray observations is consistent with those from other techniques @xcite .",
    "presence of dm around elliptical galaxies are also implied by the difference between x - ray and optical distributions @xcite .    generally , previous x - ray and lensing measurements determined the total mass at the outer region of @xmath9 , where the dm dominates , while kinematics of objects constrain the mass at the inner region of @xmath10 , where the stellar mass dominates . therefore , the overall mass profile from ( 0.110)@xmath1 for many elliptical galaxies is still unknown ; we are not aware of where the cross point between the dm and stellar mass profiles is .",
    "previous works reported two different pictures of dm content in elliptical galaxies ; dominance of dm even at the inner region of ngc 4636 @xcite and ngc 720 @xcite , while no need for dark matter in several less - luminous elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "these issues are concerned with formation scenario of elliptical galaxies ; they formed through galaxy merger or intrinsically .",
    "also it should be solved why x - ray bright and faint elliptical galaxies exist .",
    "such study is also important , since a substantial fraction of elliptical galaxies are central galaxies of galaxy groups and we must consider a massive dark matter associated with galaxy groups , apart from that of galaxies .",
    "asca observation of ngc 1399 found that it has a double structure of gravitational potential @xcite , and it is implied that dm forms two distinct scales .",
    "such a double structure is not predicted by the cdm structure formation .",
    "however , asca could not resolve the innermost region within the optical half radius of ngc 1399 , and thus contribution of stellar mass was not well studied .    nowadays",
    "x - ray studies allow us to obtain the mass profile with a wide scale from 0.1 to 10@xmath1 , and thus give us information on the overall dm density profile .",
    "unprecedentedly good angular resolution of _ chandra _ enables us to measure the temperature and brightness of ism in elliptical galaxies down to 0.1@xmath1 .",
    "in addition , a high signal - to - noise ratio and a wide field of view of _ xmm - newton _ allow us to trace the dm profile beyond the optical outskirts even for x - ray dim elliptical galaxies .",
    "previously several workers reported on the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ studies of dm profiles in elliptical galaxies @xcite , but sample is still poor , and a general view of dm in elliptical galaxies is not yet known . here , we report on studies of 53 elliptical galaxies observed with _",
    "chandra _ and deprojection analyses of 6 elliptical galaxies observed with both _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ , to examine mass profiles of elliptical galaxies . throughout this paper , we assume @xmath11 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 .",
    "we analyzed archival data of 53 elliptical galaxies observed with _",
    "acis instruments during 1999 - 2003 ( table [ tab : sample - chandra ] ) .",
    "these galaxies are selected so that their exposure time or the total photon count is more than 18 ks or 10,000 cts , respectively , to achieve a good signal - to - noise ratio . figure [ lblx ] shows the relation of the optical and x - ray luminosity of our sample galaxies .",
    "their optical luminosity @xmath13 is in the range of @xmath14 , and thus they are ordinary or giant elliptical galaxies , while x - ray luminosity scatters widely from @xmath15 erg s@xmath12 to @xmath16 erg s@xmath12 .",
    "all of galaxies lie at a redshift of @xmath17 , and most of galaxies were observed with the back - illuminated ccd chip , acis - s3 , and 6 galaxies were with the acis - i .",
    "ngc 4697 has been observed several times , and a total exposure of _ chandra _ data is 145 ks in 4 pointing observations in 2000 and 20032004 .",
    "data analysis is performed with the ciao software package version 2.3 and the calibration data base version 2.21 .",
    "we reprocessed the level 2 data from the level 1 data , and excluded time regions with high background rate .",
    "we also eliminated point sources identified with the tool _",
    "wavedetect_. we constructed response matrices , considering the source extent by using the tool _ acisspec _ , and corrected the low energy efficiency with the tool _",
    "acisabs_. background is estimated in the same detector region as on - source data by using the archival background data indicated by the tool _",
    "we checked with eye the background level by comparing the light curves , the spectrum of the whole regions of the main ccd chip , and the x - ray radial count profile between the on - source and background data . in most of the data ,",
    "the background was well reproduced within 20% accuracies , but for some objects ( ngc 720 , ngc 1700 , ngc 1705 , ngc 2434 , ngc 4494 , and ngc 5253 ) , the background level of the on - source data is somewhat higher due to the continual particle flare . since the excess background is harder and the thermal emission from elliptical galaxies are dominant at 0.61.5 kev around the fe - l line complex , it is not so significant for our analysis .",
    "we also utilized the _ xmm - newton _ archival data of some elliptical galaxies in table [ tab : sample - chandra ] , to trace the mass profile far away from the optical isophoto .",
    "about half of our sample galaxies were observed with _",
    "xmm - newton_. since the outer region of x - ray bright galaxies has already been investigated well with _",
    "rosat _ and _ asca _ , we here treat two representative x - ray bright elliptical galaxies , ngc 1399 and ngc 5044 . since we intend to investigate the mass profile from the innner to the outer region , we chose the objects whose data of both _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ have a good signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "then , 8 x - ray faint galaxies remain , but two objects ( ngc 4552 and ngc 5171 ) significantly suffer the galactic soft x - ray emission around them , and two objects are associated with the intragroup medium ( ngc 4261 and ngc 7619 ) . as a result , we analyzed the data of four x - ray faint elliptical galaxies , ngc 3923 , ngc 4697 , ngc 720 , and ic 1459 , around which we do not find any significant flat x - ray emission .",
    "observations of six galaxies analyzed here are summarized in table [ tab : sample - newton ] .",
    "we processed and analyzed the epic data with _",
    "xmmxas _ ver .",
    "we constructed response matrices , considering the source extent .",
    "time regions with high background rate are excluded .",
    "we also excluded the point source regions in the _ xmm - newton _ data . here",
    "point sources were picked up as the same method in @xcite , but the exclusion radius is set to 20@xmath18 .",
    "background is estimated in the same detector region as on - source data by using the archival background data ( jan .",
    "2002 version ) . for most of the data ,",
    "the background level is well reproduced within 30% and 60% accuracies for the mos and pn , respectively , in the energy range of 0.55 kev . on the other hand ,",
    "the background level of ngc 1399 is much higher due to the heavy particle flare .",
    "fortunately , the x - ray emission of ngc 1399 is relatively bright , the thermal emission around the fe - l line complex is still higher than the background level even at the outer galaxy region , and thus , we restricted the energy band for analyses within 0.82.0 kev .",
    "before the datailed analysis , we analyze an overall spectrum obtained with the _ chandra _ acis , to obtain overall spectral properties .",
    "we accumulated the spectra centered on the galaxy nucleus within the maximum detection radius @xmath19 , which is described in the subsequent section . in order not to use the ccd chip edge , we set the outer radius to 240@xmath18 when @xmath19 is larger than 240@xmath18 .",
    "for some galaxies , we changed the integration radius so that the central point sources or the ambient background diffuse emission are not included in the spectrum .",
    "then we fitted each spectrum with the apec model @xcite plus bremsstrahlung multiplied by the galactic absorption .",
    "the bremsstrahlung model represents the emission from unresolved point sources and we fixed the temperature to 7 kev @xcite .",
    "the column density of the galactic absorption is fixed to the value referred to @xcite .",
    "some galaxies show an indication of excess absorption , and we left the column density free for such galaxies .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ table : spec ] . for x - ray",
    "faint galaxies , the spectra were well fitted with this model , and the flux of the bremsstrahlung is consistent with the contribution of unresolved point sources in each galaxy .",
    "our results of the temperature for ngc 3585 and ngc 4494 is also consistent with that of @xcite , who analyzed the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ simultaneously . on the other hand , x - ray bright galaxies",
    "give a large reduced-@xmath20 .",
    "this is thought to be due to the significant temperature gradient , as shown in the next subsection .",
    "several galaxies give a very high luminosity of the hard component with @xmath21 erg s@xmath12 , possibly due to the imcomplete modeling of the thermal emission . since the hard component is not so significant for our studies ,",
    "we do not discuss it furthermore .",
    "temperature and density profiles of ism are necessary to derive the mass profile .",
    "the most accurate is to obtain these profiles from analysis of deprojected spectra .",
    "however , signal - to - noise ratio of data for many of x - ray dim galaxies does not allow us to measure the mass at enough number of radii .",
    "therefore , we first obtained the temperature profile from the projected spectra at several annuli , and the ism density profile from the x - ray surface brightness profile by ignoring the temperature dependence of emissivity , and then parameterized these two profiles by appropriate functions from which we derived the mass profile . in this method , projection effect on the temperature profile and neglect of the temperature dependence of emissivity gives an error to the mass estimation , but it is at most 3040% which is smaller than the statistical error in the deprojection analysis .",
    "furthermore , as described later , the mass profile derived here is found to be consistent with that derived by the deprojection analysis . therefore , the parameterization studies are valuable to obtain an overall picture of radial profiles of the temperature , gas density , and mass for elliptical galaxies .",
    "we divided a galaxy region into several rings so that the signal - to - noise ratio is more than 15 , which is enough to constrain the temperature by utilizing center energy of strong fe - l lines .",
    "the apec model is usually employed for fitting the thermal x - ray emission , but convergence of fitting is slower than the mekal @xcite and the fitting often falls into the local minimum . in this analysis ,",
    "we treat many radially sorted spectra , and thus we do not apply the apec model .",
    "then we fitted each spectrum with the mekal model plus bremsstrahlung multiplied by the galactic absorption .",
    "the column density of the galactic absorption is fixed to the value referred to @xcite .",
    "allmost all of the spectra were well fitted with this model , and the flux of the bremsstrahlung is consistent with the contribution of unresolved point sources in each galaxy .",
    "the metal abundance can not be determined accurately , and thus we do not discuss it .",
    "thus - obtained temperature profile of each galaxy is represented by a polynomial function with 0 , 1 , 2 , or 3th order .",
    "since several galaxies show a complex profile , we fitted the profile at a radius of 050@xmath18 and 50@xmath18 , separately , with a 2th - order polynominal , and jointed two polynomials smoothly .",
    "the order of the polynomial function is the same between the inner and outer region .",
    "for all the galaxies , we obtained good fits to the radial temperature profile .",
    "in the case that the number of the radially - sorted spectra is less than 5 , we assume a constant temperature profile , where the temperature is obtained in the previous subsection .    in most of galaxies ,",
    "the x - ray image is not circularly symmetric : the hot gas at the center region often suffers the jet from the galactic nucleus @xcite , while the outer region is sometimes elongated toward the specific direction . in the case of the jet disturbance , the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium does not completely hold .",
    "therefore , we must note on the correctness of mass estimation .",
    "however , the assymmetry is as small as those of the x - ray emission of galaxy clusters , for which it was reported that the assymmetry does not affect the mass estimation so much @xcite .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness profile is derived at an energy of 0.51.5 kev , and fitted with single , double , or triple @xmath22 model .",
    "profiles of most of the galaxies could be fitted well by either of the above three @xmath22 models with @xmath2310% accuracies . in several galaxies ,",
    "the radial x - ray surface brightness profile has local structures , but the deviation is at most 20% , which gives 10% error to the hot gas density .",
    "point - like emission from the galactic nuclei is observed for ngc 1553 , ngc 4261 , and ic 1459 , and we modeled its x - ray profile by the @xmath22-model with @xmath24 and core radius of 1.68@xmath18 , which are obtained by fitting the x - ray profile of the point source m33 x-8 .    in table",
    "[ table : results ] , we summarized the results of analysis on temperature and surface brightness profile for sample galaxies . the temperatures in this work are almost consistent with those obtained by the rosat pspc @xcite for 29 galaxies , but the temperature at the center region , @xmath25 in table [ table : results ] is sometimes lower for galaxies with a strong positive temperature gradient , due to finer angular resolution of _",
    "examples of two typical profiles of temperature and x - ray surface brightness are shown in figure [ r - ktsb ] , together with the parameterized function .",
    "left panel displays those of a x - ray bright galaxy ngc 1399 , wherein the temperature gradually increases toward the outer radius from 0.8 to 1.4 kev , and the x - ray emission is detected beyond the acis - s field of view .",
    "in contrast , right panel of a x - ray dim galaxy ngc 3923 presents a flat or declining temperature profile at 0.40.5 kev and a compact x - ray emission region for the same surface brightness . in figure [ r - ktne ]",
    ", we plot the temperature and ism density profiles of objects analyzed here , where the temperature profile is plotted for objects with more than three radial bins .",
    "these profiles are plotted up to the maximum radius @xmath19 , within which the source brightness is higher than @xmath26 cts s@xmath12 pix@xmath27 cm@xmath27 .",
    "when the x - ray emission from the object is extended beyond the _ chandra _ field of view , we plot the profile within @xmath29 . around some galaxies",
    ", there is a significant flat emission at the outer region , which is due to the excess instrumental background , the bright galactic x - ray background , or the virgo cluster x - ray emission . in that case",
    ", we set the @xmath19 to be small .",
    "we divide our sample into two galaxies , based on whether the ism density at 10 kpc radius is higher or lower than @xmath30 @xmath31 .",
    "hereafter we call them an extended x - ray galaxy ( exg ) or a compact x - ray galaxy ( cxg ) , respectively .",
    "the classification is shown in table [ table : results ] .",
    "in addition , galaxies whose x - ray emission does not reach 10 kpc are classified into a very compact x - ray galaxy ( vcxg ) , because we can obtain the ism properties of such objects to some extent but can not constrain their total mass profile to say anything about the dm profile .",
    "exg has a higher ism density by 310 times than cxg at the outer region , and tends to show a positive gradient in the temperature profile , like ngc 1399 .",
    "looking at the x - ray images of rosat and asca , the x - ray emission of some exgs is extended beyond 100 kpc .",
    "the temperature at the outer region is 0.91.3 kev , corresponding to that of galaxy groups .",
    "these phenomena indicate that the exg is embedded by the ambient hot intragroup medium .",
    "in fact , several exg galaxies are identified as a cd galaxy in the galaxy group , such as ngc 1399 , ngc 5044 , and ngc 4325 . on the other hand , cxg and vcxg",
    "show a flat or declining temperature profile like ngc 3923 , and the x - ray emission is detected up to at most several tens kpc .",
    "therefore , no significant hot intragroup medium is seen around cxg and vcxg .",
    "the central temperature ranges from 0.2 to 1.0 kev , and the temperature of all exgs is higher than 0.5 kev .",
    "as seen in figure [ lblx ] , exg and cxg+vcxg galaxies correspond to the x - ray bright and faint ellipticals , respectively .",
    "however , this classification does not strictly mean that exg or cxg is surrounded by the intragroup x - ray emission or not , since some galaxies associated with the intragroup x - ray emission are included in cxgs : for example , ngc 4261 @xcite and ngc 7619 @xcite .",
    "assuming the hydrostatic equilibrium , we derived the total mass profile @xmath32 from the parameterized temperature @xmath33 and gas density @xmath34 profiles , following the equation , @xmath35 the total mass is obtained for several elliptical galaxies in our sample , by the optical measurements of kinematics of stars , planatory nebulas , and dwarf galaxies .",
    "we compare the total mass @xmath36 at a given radius , to that obtained by the previous optical works . in most cases ,",
    "not the total mass @xmath36 but the mass - to - light ratio @xmath6 is available . to derive the mass - to - light ratio ,",
    "the light profile @xmath37 is nesessary .",
    "we assumes the de vaucouleurs law for the stellar distribution , while optical workers derived it from the optical observation .",
    "this difference possibly gives a different mass - to - light ratio .",
    "therefore , when the total mass @xmath36 is available , we compare it with our result .",
    "since @xcite summarizes many data of @xmath6 , we convert their value of @xmath6 at their optical - half radius to the total mass @xmath36 , by using half of the total optical luminosity used in the literature . since the @xmath13 at the optical - half radius is not explicitly written in the literature , this conversion may associate the systematic error . furthermore",
    ", @xmath36 depends on the distance to the source , and thus we corrected the reference values , by using the distance used in this work .",
    "the comparison is shown in table [ table : nfwcmp ] .",
    "our values are almost consistent with the optical works within 30% errors , but three galaxies show a large difference by a factor or @xmath38 .",
    "this is partly due to the systematic error in converting the @xmath6 into the total mass , for ngc 1399 and ngc 5846 .",
    "quite a large @xmath6 for ngc 3379 in our values indicate that the ism is not in the hydrostatic equilibrium or the contribution from unresolved point sources to the x - ray emission is significant .",
    "our result for ngc 720 and ngc 4555 is almost consistent with those in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , who analyzed the same x - ray data as ours .",
    "in addition , our values are consistent with those estimated by the stellar population synthesis @xcite . in figure [ n4697mass ]",
    "top , we compare the mass profile in this work with that in the optical works @xcite , for ngc 4472 and ngc 1399 .",
    "the mass profile is consistent with each other , and our mass profile of ngc 1399 beyond 10 kpc is also consistent with that in the previous x - ray measurements with asca @xcite .",
    "these demonstrate that the x - ray mass measurement around @xmath1 is consistent with that in the optical works , indicating that the hot ism is roughly in the hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "accordingly , we can trace the mass profile in a wide range of @xmath39 .",
    "we then derive the profile of mass - to - light ratio @xmath40 , scaled total mass @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a radius .",
    "a scaling virial mass @xmath43 is calculated as @xmath44 , referring to @xcite .",
    "we scale @xmath36 profile with a scaling ( virial ) radius @xmath45 kpc , and @xmath6 profile with an optical - half radius @xmath1 . here , @xmath46 is a temperature at 10 kpc from the galaxy center where the dark matter in general dominates , and this temperature is calculated from the model of the temperature profile .",
    "the reason why we do not derive the virial radius by extrapolating the mass profile is that the maximum detection radius is smaller by a factor of @xmath47 than the virial radius for most galaxies , and thus the extrapolation introduces large uncertainties .",
    "we present the above profiles from @xmath48 to the maximum x - ray detection radius in figure [ r - mls ] , since a bin number of the radial surface brightness profile is not enough within a central 4@xmath18 and thus the modeling is incomplete .",
    "it is clearly seen that , in many galaxies , there is a region where @xmath6 becomes constant around 310 @xmath49 .",
    "this region ( @xmath50 ) corresponds to that where stellar mass dominates .",
    "@xmath6 values of exg at this region tend to be larger than that of cxg ; 725 @xmath49 for exg , and 37 @xmath49 for cxg .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath6 profile has a break around @xmath1 , and @xmath51 gradually rises up toward the outer region .",
    "these indicate that @xmath6 is not constant around galaxies and thus the presence of dark matter is needed . in comparison to cxg , exg has a clear break in the profile and a breaking radius is small .",
    "the drop of @xmath6 at the innermost radius is seen in several galaxies .",
    "since the inner region often suffers the radio jet from the central active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , the ism is thought to be deviated from the hydrostatic equilibrium in those galaxies .",
    "in contrast to a large scatter of the @xmath6 profile in the outer dm - dominated region , the scaled mass profile has a small scatter . these indicate that the temperature at the outer region well represents the gravitational potential depth , and the optical - half radius @xmath1 is not appropriate for scaling the total mass profile .",
    "the slope of the scaling mass profile has a break around 0.01@xmath0 , within which stars dominate dark matter in mass .      in the parameterization analyses",
    ", we must pay attention to model dependencies of mass profiles , by considering uncertainties associated with the parameterizing model functions .",
    "alternatively , we here performed the deprojection analyses on the _ chandra _ data .",
    "we extracted several projected spectra of concentric annulus centered on the galaxy .",
    "we chose the radial bins so that the signal - to - noise ratio is more than 40 or 30 for exgs or cxgs , respectively .",
    "however , as seen in table [ table : results ] , photon statistics for 40% of galaxies , most of which are cxgs or vcxgs , is too poor to perform the deprojection .",
    "deprojected spectra were derived from these projected spectra , following the method described in @xcite . here , we modified their method by considering the emission out of the deprojected spherical region .",
    "we fitted the x - ray radial count rate profile with a single @xmath22 model , and utilized the best - fit parameters to represent the emission out of the deprojected spherical region and calculate the projection contribution of that region to the inner region .",
    "deprojected spectra were fitted with one temperature mekal plasma model multiplied by the photoelectric absorption .",
    "we fixed the absorption column density to the galactic value . since release of an abundance parameter introduces a large error on the emission measure , we first fitted the spectra with the abundance free and took an average of the abundance values over deprojected spectra .",
    "then , we fixed the abundance to the average value . for x - ray faint galaxies , we fixed the temperature to the value which is calculated from the parameterized model function of the temperature profile obtained in the previous subsection for the corresponding radius . from the fits of deprojected spectra , we can obtain the 3-dimensional temperature and ism density profiles , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where we took a bin radius as a count - rate - weighted average of radii of all pixels in the analyzed region . in figure [ depn ]",
    ", we plot an example of 3-dimensional @xmath34 profiles obtained here .",
    "we then obtained the mass profiles from @xmath33 and @xmath34 , based on the hydrostatic equilibrium in which we took a finite difference approximation for calculating a derivative term .    in figure",
    "[ n4697mass ] , we plot an example of the mass profile obtained by the deprojection analysis .",
    "the total mass profile obtained in the parameterization analysis , the stellar , and ism mass profiles are also plotted . it can be seen that total mass profiles in both analyses are consistent with each other . for ngc 4697 , we can measure the mass up to @xmath5220 kpc , thanks to its long exposure , but it is impossible in most cxgs like ngc 3923 .",
    "the total mass seems to be lower than the stellar mass in some galaxies , but this is thought to be attributed to the incorrect distance @xmath53 or the incorrect mass - to - light ratio for the stellar mass .",
    "note that the total or stellar mass dependes on the distance with @xmath54 or @xmath55 .",
    "for example , @xmath53 to ngc 4697 is assumed to be 15.1 mpc in this work , and if we use @xmath56 mpc in @xcite , the total mass becomes higher than the stellar mass .    in figure [ nfwcmp ] , the scaled mass is plotted for all the deprojected points of sample galaxies .",
    "the mass profiles are obtained at ( 0.0010.1)@xmath0 for exg galaxies , and have a concave shape around 0.01@xmath0 , in good agreement with the previous subsection .",
    "these data can be compared with the scaled nfw mass profile and stellar mass profile . here , the scaled nfw mass profile is expressed as @xmath57 where @xmath58 ; here we assume the scaling radius @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , only one parameter @xmath60 determines the shape of the mass profile : for the same @xmath60 , the scaled mass profile is identical independently of the system scale .",
    "we show the nfw profile with @xmath61 , which is a typical value for rich clusters @xcite .",
    "the stellar mass profile is different among galaxies , since the effective radius and virial radius are different . here",
    ", we plot the typical stellar mass profile , assuming @xmath62 kpc , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and virial temperature of 0.6 kev . at the inner region",
    ", the mass profile goes along the typical stellar mass profile , and , at the outer region , it well matches the nfw profile . comparing with the averaged mass profile of rich clusters in @xcite ( dashed line in figure [ nfwcmp ] )",
    ", it is found that the scaled mass profile almost follows the nfw profile from x - ray bright elliptical galaxies ( galaxy groups ) to rich clusters .",
    "using the data points beyond 10 kpc where the dark matter dominates , we fitted the profile with the nfw model by varying the concentration parameter @xmath60 , and obtained @xmath65 .",
    "since the obtained data points can be fitted with the powerlaw model , and the inner slope of mass profile is also fitted to be @xmath66 .",
    "this value corresponds to the density inner slope of @xmath67 , somewhat larger than those of rich clusters @xcite .",
    "this is partly due to that the mass used here includes not only dark matter but also a significant fraction of stellar mass at the inner region .",
    "most of the above data points come from exgs , while data points of cxgs are limited at the inner region of @xmath68 or @xmath23(23)@xmath1 , where the total mass is almost explained by the stellar mass .",
    "nevertheless , we do not see any difference between exg and cxg , and there is a hint of the dark matter halo around cxgs in figure [ n4697mass ] .",
    "narrow field of view and low signal - to - noise ratio of the _ chandra _ data do not allow us to investigate the mass profile up to 3@xmath1 , and thus we can not constrain the dark matter content for x - ray faint galaxies ( cxgs ) .",
    "therefore , we utilized _ xmm - newton _ data to overcome this limitations . here , we analyzed the data of six galaxies , ngc 1399 , ngc 5044 , ngc 3923 , ngc 4697 , ngc 720 , and ic 1459 , which were observed with both _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. combining both data , we trace the mass profiles precisely from inner to outer parts of galaxies by deprojection analysis , independently of the modeling function . the procedures of deprojections and spectral fittings are the same as described in the previous subsection , but in this case , we do not fix the temperature .",
    "the radii of annulus are not the same between _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data .",
    "the galaxy center region is finely divided for the _ chandra _ data , while the _ xmm - newton _ data cover the outer region with large steps of shell radii .",
    "we took common radii of annulus among three epic instruments .",
    "spectra of mos1 and mos2 are summed up before deprojection , and we analyzed the deprojected spectra of pn and mos1 + 2 simultaneously .",
    "the pn data of ngc 1399 and ngc 4697 can not be analyzed , due to data acquisition error or severe background rate .",
    "the obtained profiles of the temperature and ism density are consistent between _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ within 15% .    in figure",
    "[ n720mass ] , we plot an example of the mass profiles of cxgs obtained here . it can be seen that _",
    "mass profiles at the inner region smoothly connect to _ xmm - newton _ profiles at the outer region and data points of _ xmm - newton _ give an estimation with a smaller error .",
    "it can be seen that the reults obtained here are almost consistent with those by the parameterization analyses of the _ chandra _ data .",
    "the mass of cxgs can be traced beyond 10 kpc , and exceeds much the stellar mass at the outer region , as well as exgs . in figure",
    "[ mlall ] , we plot the radial profiles of the mass - to - light ratio of six galaxies . within 10 kpc ,",
    "the mass - to - light ratio is almost constant around 58 , in good agreement with the results in the previous subsections . beyond 10 kpc , the mass - to - light ratio increases",
    "significantly , even for cxgs , ngc 3923 , ngc 720 , and ic 1459 .",
    "although we can not trace the mass of cxgs as far away as exgs , the upturn of the mass - to - light profiles indicates that the dark matter halo exists around cxgs , as well as exgs .    using the data points beyond 10 kpc where the dark matter dominates to constrain the dark matter profile , as well as the previous subsection",
    ", we obtained @xmath69 for nfw profile and the density inner slope of @xmath70 for powerlaw profile .",
    "these are consistent with those for only the _ chandra _ data .",
    "therefore , we fitted the mass profile , including the _ chandra _ data of other galaxies whose _ xmm - newton _ data are not treated here .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ nfwfitcmp ] left .",
    "we obtained @xmath71 and @xmath72 . since we assumed the virial radius @xmath0 to be as in  [ para - ana ] , this value of @xmath60 indicates the scaling radius @xmath73 kpc . in most cases",
    ", we can not trace the mass profile up to @xmath74 here , we can not determine the convex region in the nfw profile .",
    "this does not allow us to constrain the true virial radius @xmath75 .",
    "at fact , when we fit the mass profile with the nfw model which includes two parameters , @xmath60 and @xmath76 , the best - fit values of @xmath60 varies as shown in figure [ nfwfitcmp ] right .",
    "we also tried to fit the profile with the king profile @xcite , and the core radius is constrained to be @xmath68 .",
    "we can not rule out the king profile , but the king model can not fit the mass profile if the scaling mass profile is the same shape as that of galaxy clusters . since the stellar mass can not be completely ignored around 10 kpc , the above values of @xmath60 and @xmath77",
    "are thought to be upper or lower limit , respectively .",
    "we tried to fit the mass profile with the nfw and powerlaw model , by considering the typical stellar mass profile which is the same as that in  [ chandra - dep ] . as a result",
    ", we obtained @xmath78 for the nfw model and @xmath79 for the powewlaw model .",
    "therefore , considering the uncertainties of the assumed stellar mass , the parameters have a range of @xmath80 or @xmath81 .",
    "we systematically analyzed _ chandra _ data of 53 elliptical galaxies , and obtained the temperature and ism density profile to derive the mass profile .",
    "galaxies are mainly classified into two types , based on the temperature and ism density profile .",
    "one type ( exg ) has a positive temperature gradient toward the outer radius and the ism density is higher at the outer region .",
    "the other ( cxg ) has a declining or flat temperature profile and the ism density is lower at the outer region .",
    "these corresponds to x - ray bright elliptical galaxies and x - ray faint ones , respectively . as well as `` x - ray bright / faint '' , the separation between exgs and cxgs is ambiguous , and they are rather continuously linking with each other .",
    "both types of galaxies which have been recognized in the previous works are now clearly distinguished by the temperature and gas density profiles .",
    "nevertheless , the mass profile is consistent between two types of galaxies .",
    "the mass profile is well scaled by a virial radius @xmath0 rather than an optical - half radius @xmath1 , and smoothly connects to those of clusters of galaxies .",
    "this implies that structure formation by dark matter can be described in an unified way from rich clusters down to galaxies .    higher temperature and higher density of hot gas at the outer region indicates that exg is surrounded by the hot intragroup medium . at fact , the gas mass of some exgs has found to be comparable to the stellar mass by the previous works @xcite .",
    "lower temperature at the inner region would correspond to the gravitational potential depth of galaxy itself . in figure",
    "[ vtmll ] , we plot the temperature of the innermost radius against the stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "temperature roughly correlates with the velocity dispersion @xmath82 as @xmath83 with @xmath84 , consistent with the picture that ism is heated by the stellar motion @xcite , in other words , gravitational energy .",
    "exg shows somewhat higher temperature than cxg , indicating that the temperature of ism is somewhat affected by the ambient hotter intragroup medium even at the innermost region .",
    "therefore , we must pay attention to that ism properties of exg do not necessarily represent galaxy properties . on the other hand , vcxgs with lower @xmath82",
    "deviate from the typical @xmath85 relation of higher @xmath82 cxgs , indicating that their ism suffers non - gravity heatings such as supernovae and stellar mass loss or does not satisfy the hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the mass profile well traces a stellar mass profile with a constant mass - to - light ratio of @xmath5 at the inner region of ( 0.0010.01)@xmath0 or ( 0.11)@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , baryon mass dominates in the inner region of elliptical galaxies ; a faction of the star mass is 5362% at @xmath86 and 95.596.5% at @xmath87 when we assume the nfw mass profile of @xmath71 obtained in ",
    "[ cha - new - dep ] and the stellar mass profile in  [ para - ana ] , where the optical half radius is @xmath88 kpc , and @xmath87 is equivalent to 0.9 kpc .",
    "however , note that these are not very rigorous limits since composite mass models are not actually explicitly fit to the data",
    ". @xmath6 ratio of exg increases steeply beyond @xmath7 , and thus requires a presence of massive dark matter halo , which is extended than stars as well as spiral galaxies .",
    "the crossing radius between stars and dark matter is around 10 kpc , quite similar to that of spiral galaxies with a similar mass scale , and thus the radial mass profile is not different between ellipticals and spirals ; the difference is presence or absence of stellar disk components .",
    "these indicate that a double structure of gravitational potential in x - ray bright elliptical galaxies is mainly due to the different scale of mass concentration between stars and dark matter , rather than two distinct scales of dark matter .",
    "the mass profile is not well scaled by the optical - half radius @xmath1 .",
    "this is concerned with the fact that @xmath1 scatters widely among galaxies with similar @xmath13 . in other words ,",
    "stellar distribution is different among galaxies with the same mass , independent of the gravitational potential , as indicated by @xcite .",
    "connection between individual galaxies and galaxy clusters is also an interesting issue , and x - ray bright elliptical galaxies are intermediate systems since they are often located at the center of galaxy groups .",
    "cdm structure formation theories do not give any distinct scales separating individual galaxies and clusters , while stellar distributions show a clear separation .",
    "our results show that dark matter associated with cd galaxy itself is not distinguished with that of the surround galaxy group .",
    "this implies that cd galaxies evolved together with galaxy groups or clusters .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ analyses of 10 galaxy clusters show that the scaled mass profile of these objects well trace the nfw profile @xcite . considering it together with our results , the dark matter profile in elliptical galaxies or galaxy groups",
    "follow the nfw profile as well as galaxy clusters .",
    "the slope of dark matter profile gives information on the properties of dark matter , and it is reported to be consistent with the cdm model for rich clusters @xcite . as described in ",
    "[ cha - new - dep ] , the slope of mass profile at the inner region is @xmath81 and thus consistent with the nfw profile , but can not rule out the self - interacting dark matter model @xcite or adiabatic compression of dark matter @xcite .",
    "our constraint is still poor due to the dominant stellar mass at the inner region . on the other hand ,",
    "mass measurements of low - surface - brightness galaxies and dwarf irregular galaxies indicate no evidence of dm cusp profile at the center region @xcite . therefore , measurement of the exact slope of ordinary elliptical galaxies is important to solve the above problem .",
    "the concentration parameter @xmath60 for the nfw model is obtained to be @xmath80 , somewhat smaller than that for rich clusters @xcite . however ,",
    "if the true virial radius @xmath89 is larger than the assumed one @xcite , a larger value of @xmath60 is allowed .",
    "numerical simulations of the cdm halo predict a larger @xmath60 for lower - mass systems @xcite ; @xmath90 for objects with the virial mass of @xmath91 , corresponding to that of elliptical galaxies .",
    "our data allow @xmath90 if @xmath92 .",
    "anyway , the mass around elliptical galaxies seems to be less concentrated than prediction , indicating that the formation epoch is recent and thus merger evolution of elliptical galaxies is preferred .    for x - ray dim galaxies , we can not well constrain the dark matter content , but find some hints of @xmath6 increase for cxgs with @xmath93 .",
    "asca and rosat observations found x - ray emission of such cxgs up to ( 48)@xmath1 . extrapolating the constant temperature profile to this radius , a massive dark matter becomes necessary for these galaxies with @xmath94 .",
    "it is reported that intermediate luminous elliptical galaxies with @xmath95 do not need dark matter within 5@xmath1 @xcite . among galaxies they reported ,",
    "the mass profile of ngc 4697 is analyzed up to @xmath96 in this paper .",
    "the @xmath97 at @xmath98 is consistent between our results and their works . additionally , among four cxgs analyzed in subsection [ cha - new - dep ] , ngc 720 and ic 1459 with @xmath95 show a hint of the @xmath6 increase toward the galaxy outskirts .",
    "therefore , we suggest that ordinary elliptical galaxies commonly contain a massive dark matter halo .",
    "if cxg has a massive dark matter halo , they could also have an extended x - ray emission up to @xmath99 .",
    "such an indication is also obtained from asca observations of galaxies and clusters @xcite . in our sample ,",
    "any less massive galaxies with @xmath100 do not show enough x - ray emission to trace the dark matter , and thus studies of less - luminous elliptical galaxies are also needed to resolve this issue unambiguously .",
    "since it is probably very faint and cool , x - ray emissivity is too low to detect with _ chandra_. therefore , further improvement of this study will be achieved by the low background instrument with a wide field - of - view , such as astro - e2/suzaku xis .",
