    "although we calculated the case of @xmath13 by using much higher precision , we still could not render the two @xmath11 s consistent .",
    "one should keep in mind that the relations   and   are deduced form conventional superconductivity under some additional approximations .",
    "in contrast , our holographic construction is , in principle , only applicable for the superconductors at strong coupling , thus , a priori , would far deviate form the conventional one which is weakly interacted .",
    "an instructive example is to consider the well - known abelian - higgs model in ads case .",
    "as the temperature decreases , there exists a gap frequency @xmath111 from the optical conductivity in the superconducting phase , and one can also read off the energy gap @xmath112 from the low temperature behaviour of normal contribution to the dc conductivity . in a standard weak coupling picture of superconductivity , the gap @xmath111 is understood as the energy required to break a cooper pair into its constitutive electrons and the energy of the constituent quasiparticles is given by @xmath112 .",

    "it is desirable to understand our results form condensed matter theory point view",

    "similar discussion can be straightforwardly generalized to include hyperscaling violation characterised by @xmath114 , another important exponent in low energy physics of condensed matter system . in cases with general @xmath114 and @xmath9 ,",
    "the dual non - relativistic theory is not even scale invariant , qualitatively different from its lifshitz counterpart .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that the main results would be similar to the lifshitz geometry .",
    "there are various kinds of junctions , and the properties of these junctions can be considerably different .",
    "it is , however , known that a sinusoidal current - phase relation is only a special case in josephson tunneling , which is attainable only for such as temperatures sufficiently close to critical temperature or sufficiently high and wide potential barriers between two superconductors  @xcite . so far , similar studies initiated from ref .",
