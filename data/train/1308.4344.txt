    "white - dwarf  main - sequence ( wdms ) binaries consist of a ( blue ) white dwarf primary and a ( red ) low - mass main - sequence ( ms ) companion formed from ms binaries where the primary has a mass @xmath1 .",
    "most of the wdms binaries ( @xmath2 ) are wide binaries @xcite , of which the initial ms binary separation is large enough that the two components will never interact and evolve like single stars @xcite .",
    "consequently , the orbital period of these systems will increase because of the mass loss of the primary ( the white dwarf precursor ) .",
    "the remaining @xmath3 of the wdms binaries are close binaries .",
    "when the more massive star of a close binary leaves the ms and evolves into the giant branch or asymptotic giant branch phase , there is a dynamically unstable mass transfer to the ms companion and then the system goes through a common - envelope phase @xcite during which it may continue evolving to an even shorter orbital period through angular momentum loss mechanisms ( magnetic braking and gravitational radiation ) or undergo a second common envelope .",
    "binary population synthesis models @xcite indicate the bimodal nature of the orbital period distribution of the entire population of wdms binaries .    during the common - envelope phase of close binaries",
    ", the binary separation undergoes a rapid decrease and consequently orbital energy and angular momentum are extracted from the orbit , leading to the ejection of the envelope and exposing a post - common - envelope binary ( pceb ) .",
    "these pcebs are important objects that may be progenitor candidates of cataclysmic variables @xcite and perhaps type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "they can also improve the theory of close binary evolution @xcite , especially the understanding of the physics of common - envelope evolution @xcite . among the variety of pcebs ( such as sdob+ms binaries , wdms binaries , and double degenerates ) , wdms binaries are intrinsically the most common ones and the stellar components ( white dwarfs and m dwarfs ) of wdms binaries are relatively simple .",
    "there are more and more wdms binaries being found from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , making them the most ideal population to help us understand common - envelope evolution .",
    "in addition , wdms binaries , especially eclipsing wdms binaries , also provide an interesting test of stellar evolution for both the white dwarf primary and the secondary low - mass ms in the binary environment @xcite .    until now , a large number of wdms binaries @xcite have been efficiently identified from the sdss .",
    "@xcite first attempted to study the wdms pairs using sdss data from the early data release @xcite and data release one @xcite .",
    "they identified 109 wdms pairs with @xmath4 20th magnitude .",

    "wdms binary samples and the identified pcebs , some important work has been done to test binary population models as well as study the stellar structures , magnetic activity , common - envelope evolution , and other properties .",
    "for example , @xcite pointed out that 21%24% of sdss wdms binaries have undergone common - envelope evolution , which is in good agreement with the predictions of binary population models @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the majority of low - mass ( @xmath5 0.5 @xmath6 ) white dwarfs are formed in close binaries by investigating the white dwarf mass distributions of pcebs .",
    "@xcite studied the apparent period variations of eclipsing pcebs and provided two possible interpretations : second - generation planet formation or variations in the shape of a magnetically active secondary star . @xcite investigated the magnetic - activity  rotation  age relations for m stars in close wdms binaries and wide wdms binaries using what is so far the largest and most homogeneous sample of sdss wdms binaries @xcite .",
    "they found that m dwarfs in wide wdms binaries are younger and more active than field m dwarfs and the activity of m dwarfs in close binaries is independent of the spectral type .",
    "as discussed above , several previous studies had developed color selection criteria based on the model colors of binary systems in order to select wdms binaries from the sdss @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite developed an initial set of photometric selection criteria ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 to a limiting magnitude of @xmath4 20 ) to identify binary systems using sdss photometry and yielded reliable results .",
    "here we present a sample of wdms binaries also selected with a series of photometric criteria from the spectra of large sky area multi - object fiber spectroscopic telescope ( lamost , also called the guo shou jing telescope , gsjt ; * ? ? ?",

    "we discuss the sample selection and provide stellar parameters of the individual components of some binary systems ( e.g. , effective temperature , surface gravity , radius , mass and cooling age for the white dwarf ; effective temperature , surface gravity , metallicity , spectral type , radius , and mass of the m dwarf ) .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section 2",

    "lamost ( gsjt ) is a quasi - meridian reflecting schmidt telescope @xcite located at the xinglong observing station in the hebei province of china .",
    "a brief description of the hardware and associated software of lamost can be found in @xcite , which is a dedicated review and technical summary of the lamost project .",
    "the optical system of lamost has three major components : a schmidt correcting mirror ma ( mirror a ) , a primary mirror mb ( mirror b ) , and a focal surface .",
    "the ma ( 5.72 m @xmath11 4.40 m ) is made up of 24 hexagonal plane sub - mirrors and the mb ( 6.67 m @xmath11 6.05 m ) has 37 hexagonal spherical sub - mirrors .",
    "both are controlled by active optics .",
    "lamost has a field of view as large as 20 deg@xmath12 , a large effective aperture that varies from 3.6 to 4.9 m in diameter ( depending on the direction it is pointing ) , and 4000 fibers installed on the circular focal plane with a diameter of 1.75 m. it has 16 spectrographs and 32 ccd cameras ( each spectrograph equipped with two ccd cameras of blue and red channels ) , so there are 250 fiber spectra in each obtained ccd image .",
    "the up - to - date complete lists of lamost technical and scientific publications can be found at http://www.lamost.org/public/publication    the main aim of lamost is the extragalactic spectroscopic survey of galaxies ( to study the large - scale structure of the universe ) and the stellar spectroscopic survey of the milky way ( to study the structure and evolution of the galaxy ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on these scientific goals , the lamost survey mainly contains two parts : the lamost extragalactic survey ( legas ) and the lamost experiment for galactic understanding and exploration ( legue ) survey of the milky way ( see @xcite for the detailed science plan of legue ) .",
    "it started a scientific spectroscopic survey of more than 10 million objects in 2012 september which will last for about five years . before that",
    ", there was a two - year commissioning survey starting in 2009 , and then a pilot spectroscopic survey performed using lamost from 2011 october to 2012 june .",
    "the lamost pilot survey is a test run of the telescope system to check instrumental performance and assess the feasibility of the science goals before the regular spectroscopic survey @xcite .",
    "based on the scientific goals proposed above , some scientists provided sources for lamost during the pilot survey .",
    "for example , @xcite describe the legue disk target selection for the pilot survey .",
    "there are about 380 plates observed during the pilot survey , including the sources in the disk , spheroid , and anticenter of the milky way ; m31 targets ; galaxies ; and quasars .",
    "figure [ fig : footprint ] shows the footprint of the lamost pilot survey @xcite .",
    "the lamost pilot survey includes nine full - moon cycles during 2011 october and 2012 june ( see @xcite for details of the site conditions of lamost ) .",
    "each moon cycle of the pilot survey was divided into three parts , dark nights ( five days sequentially before and after the new moon ) , bright nights ( five days sequentially before and after the full moon ) and gray nights ( the remaining nights in the cycle ) . in principle , dark nights and bright nights should be used for sources with magnitude 14.5 @xmath13 19.5 and 11.5 @xmath13 16.5 respectively , and the corresponding exposure times were 3 @xmath11 30 minutes and 3 @xmath11 10 minutes ( depending on the distribution of the brightness of the sources ) , respectively .",
    "the raw ccd data are reduced and analyzed by the lamost data reduction system , which mainly includes the two - dimensional ( 2d ) pipeline ( for spectra extraction and calibration ) and the one - dimensional ( 1d ) pipeline ( to classify spectra and measure their redshifts ; * ? ? ?",
    "what we want to mention is the flux calibration method of lamost , which is different from that of the sdss . because there is no network of photometric standard stars for lamost , @xcite proposed a relative flux calibration method .",
    "they select standard stars ( like sdss f8 subdwarf standards ) for each spectrograph field . after observation ,",
    "if the pre - selected standard stars do not have good spectral quality , they use the lick spectral index grid method ( see @xcite for details ) to select new standard stars .",
    "then the spectral response function for these standard stars is used to calibrate the raw spectra obtained from other fibers of the spectrograph @xcite .",
    "about one million spectra were obtained during the lamost pilot survey ( see @xcite for the description of the data release of the lamost pilot survey ) .",

    ", we plan to reduce the sample by means of the photometric selection method .",
    "the lamost survey is a multi - object spectroscopic survey that does not conduct an imaging survey like the sdss . because of the diversity of the target selection of the pilot survey , not all stars in the lamost pilot survey have sdss magnitudes ( by cross matching with the sdss dr9 photometric catalog we find that about 60% of the 644,540 stars have sdss magnitudes ) , so we can not use the sdss @xmath19 magnitude to do color selection and need to develop our own color selection criteria .",

    "night , we use the stars that have corresponding sdss fiber magnitudes to fit a linear relationship between the sdss fiber color and our convolved color to roughly calibrate our convolved color .    because the sdss wdms binary catalog ( 2248 binaries ) has a completeness of nearly @xmath29 98 @xmath30 and represents what is so far the largest and most homogeneous sample set of wdms binaries @xcite",
    ", we convolve these 2248 binary spectra with the sdss @xmath19 responsing curves ( the same as the above procedure of calculating lamost convolved color ) to help us give the color - cut criteria for the lamost sample . considering that the spectra in the @xmath31 and @xmath32 bands have very small overlap with the photometric @xmath33 and @xmath34 band , we neglect the @xmath31 and @xmath32 band photometry and only use @xmath22 versus @xmath23 to constrain the color selection criteria .",
    "the following are color - cuts we adopted in this paper : @xmath35    after applying these color - cut criteria ( the area formed by the black lines in figure [ fig : colorcut ] ) to the 207,596 stars , our sample shrank to 90,079 .",
    "we then searched for wdms binary candidates among these 90,079 stars by eye check .",
    "the efficiency of the lamost blue spectrograph is much lower than the red one @xcite , so for the spectra with low s / ns in the blue band , the balmer line series are easily superimposed by the noise .",
    "but the red band of the spectra have clear m dwarf line features for most of the samples .",
    "based on these considerations , we select the wdms binary candidates that clearly exhibit an m dwarf in the red band and a resolved white dwarf component with balmer lines in the blue band of their spectra . in order to identify binaries easily , we decompose the spectra using principal component analysis ( pca ) ( see @xcite for the details of the pca decomposition ) .",
    "the wdms binary spectrum is a mixture of a white dwarf spectrum and a m dwarf spectrum , @xmath36 where , @xmath37 is the mixed spectrum , @xmath38 and @xmath39 represent the @xmath26 white dwarf eigen - spectra , and the @xmath40 m dwarf eigen - spectra we used to do spectral decomposition , respectively , and @xmath41 are the coefficients of eigen - spectra . at first , we construct four pca eigen - spectra ( @xmath42 ) from the white dwarf model spectral library and 12 pca eigen - spectra ( @xmath43 ) from the m dwarf model spectral library ( the details of the white dwarf and m dwarf models can be found in section 3 ) .",
    "then we determine all the coefficients of the eigen - spectra by the svd ( singular value decomposition ) matrix decomposition and orthogonal transformation . after the coefficients of the eigen - spectra",

    "meanwhile , the secondary component shows obvious molecule absorption band features of a m - type star , which also can not be contaminated by the neighboring k7-type star .",
    "so this binary may not suffer from fiber contaminations . for other binaries ,",

    "to investigate the properties of the individual components of our wdms binary systems , we adopt the template - matching method based on model atmosphere calculations for white dwarfs and m main - sequence stars to separate the two stellar spectra and derive parameters for each system .",
    "we only give stellar parameters for the 10 wdms spectra with relatively high spectral quality ( s / n @xmath17 5 ) . with the exception of one db wdms binary ,",

    "we use a template - matching method like @xcite to decompose a wdms binary spectrum into a white dwarf and a ms star simultaneously and derive independent parameters for each component .",
    "this method @xcite is able to avoid a mutual dependence of the two scaling factors for wd and m stars since the system of equations can be solved uniquely and also avoids the effects of identifying a local @xmath58 minimum .",
    "our template matching method is not a bona fide weighted @xmath58 minimization technique because we do not divide by @xmath59 ( the observational error ) in the @xmath58 function of ( * ? ? ?",

    ", we note that the template - fitting method that does not divide by @xmath59 gives much better results .",
    "the main reason for this is that the observational error given by the lamost ",
    ".fits \" file is the inverse - variance of the flux and may not exactly represent the uncertainty of the flux , so it will distinctly affect the @xmath58 fitting results .",
    "additionally , the flux calibration of the lamost spectra is relative ( mentioned in section 2 , or see details in @xcite ) , which means the reddening of the standard stars may affect the flux calibration , especially when the standard stars have very different spacial positions ( or reddening ) from other stars in the same spectrograph .",
    "this may lead to some difference in the continuum between the observational spectra and model spectra . considering the complexity of reddening , to simplify we empirically incorporate quintic polynomials to heller s template - matching method in order to overcome the possible failure of the fit .",

    "an example of a typical wdms spectrum in our sample and its spectral decomposition are shown in figure [ fig : example ] .",
    "as @xcite mentioned , the quality of this spectra - fitting technique is poor in a mathematical context and the standard deviations of the measured parameters are quite weak in terms of physical significance .",
    "that means that the unknown systematic errors ( due to the incomplete molecular data of the m star model , flux calibration errors , and possible interstellar reddening ) of the stellar parameters are larger than the mathematical ones . for a conservative estimate of errors in the measured parameters ,",
    "we refer to @xcite and assume an uncertainty of half the model step width for the wds and ms stars .",
    "we assume an uncertainty of 2000 k for wds with effective temperatures of less than 50,000 k and 100 k for the ms stars .",
    "while for @xmath75 k , the uncertainty is given by half of the model step width of 5000 k. limited by the low resolution of the lamost spectra and the step size of our model grid , the accuracy of the surface gravities is given as @xmath76 dex and @xmath77 dex .",
    "like @xcite , we also assume an uncertainty of 0.3 dex for metallicity below @xmath451.0 dex .",
    "for metallicity over @xmath451.0 dex , the corresponding uncertainty is given by half of the model step width of 0.25 dex .    because the flux - calibration of lamost spectra are relative , it is impossible for us to derive the distances of the two components of our wdms binaries from the best - fitting flux scaling factors that scale the model flux to the observed flux .",
    "once @xmath78 and @xmath79 are determined , we estimate the cooling ages , masses and radii for the white dwarfs by interpolating the detailed evolutionary cooling sequences @xcite .",

    "if the probability @xmath89 that the @xmath60 test returns is below 0.0027 ( meaning the probability @xmath90 of a system showing large radial velocity variation is above 0.9973 where @xmath91 ) , we can say that we detect 3@xmath0 radial velocity variation and the corresponding wdms binary can be considered a strong pceb candidate . here",
    "we find two pceb candidates , lamost j105421.88@xmath44512254.1 and lamost j122037.01@xmath44492334.0 , using the nai doublet radial velocities .",
    "lamost j105421.88@xmath44512254.1 shows 3@xmath0 radial velocity variation using either nai doublet or h@xmath85 emission , while for lamost j122037.01@xmath44492334.0 , we detect 3@xmath0 radial velocity variation using the nai doublet . by cross - referencing 195 pceb candidates provided by @xcite , we find that lamost j105421.88@xmath44512254.1 has already been identified as a pceb candidate .",
    "limited by the sample size , we only find one new pceb candidate : lamost j122037.01@xmath44492334.0 .",
    "we estimate the upper limits to orbital periods for these two pceb candidates in the same way as described in @xcite . because we do not provide stellar parameters for these two binaries , the white dwarf masses and the secondary star masses are taken from @xcite .",
    "the radial velocity amplitudes of the secondary stars are obtained by using the nai doublet radial velocities ( table 3 ) .",
    "table 4 presents the probability @xmath90 of measuring large radial velocity variations for these two binaries and the calculated upper limits to their orbital periods .",
    "both pceb candidates need intense follow - up spectroscopic observations in order to obtain orbital periods .",
    "we have presented a catalog of 28 wdms binaries from the spectroscopic lamost pilot survey in this paper . using the colors of the 2248 binaries from the sdss wdms binary catalog ,",
    "we develop our own color selection criteria for the selection of wdms binaries from the lamost pilot survey based on the lamost magnitudes obtained by convolving the lamost spectra with the sdss @xmath19 filter response curve .",
    "this method is efficient for searching for binaries in the spectroscopic survey without having our own optical or infrared photometric data equipment like the lamost survey . using the color selection criteria , we identify 28 wdms binaries from the lamost pilot survey .",
    "nine of these binaries have been published in previous works and 19 of these wdms binaries are new . for 10 of our binaries ,",
    "we have used a @xmath60 minimization technique to decompose the binary spectra and determine the effective temperatures , surface gravities of the white dwarfs , as well as the effective temperatures , surface gravities , and metallicities for the m - type companions .",
    "the cooling ages , masses and radii of white dwarfs are provided by interpolating the white dwarf cooling sequences for the derived effective temperatures and surface gravities .",
    "we also derive the spectral types , masses , and radii of the m stars by using empirical spectral type  effective temperature , spectral type  mass , and spectral type  radius relations .",
    "in addition , the radial velocities are measured for most of our sample .",
    "we also discuss the possible pceb candidates among the binary systems with multiple spectra in our sample , finally giving two possible pceb candidates , one of which has already been identified as a pceb candidate by the sdss .",
    "the wdms binary catalog is the first provided by the lamost survey , and demonstrates the capability of lamost to search for wdms binaries . with the ongoing formal lamost survey , we hope to find many more wdms binaries and present a more complete catalog of wdms binaries , which will increase the number of known wdms binary systems .",
    "enlarging the wdms binary sample will lead to a deeper understanding of close compact binary star evolution and other follow - up studies .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for very useful comments and suggestions that greatly improved this paper .",
    "we thank alberto rebassa - mansergas for the discussion about the detection of pcebs .",
