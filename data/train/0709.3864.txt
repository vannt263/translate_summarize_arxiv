    "recall that a smooth distribution @xmath2 is called if any local smooth frame @xmath9 for @xmath2 , together with all of its iterated lie brackets spans the whole tangent bundle of @xmath1 .",
    "( in pdes , the bracket - generating condition is also called the hrmander condition . ) by the well - known theorem of chow and rashevskii  @xcite , if @xmath2 is bracket generating , then @xmath10 , for all @xmath11",
    ".    however , @xmath2 does not have to be bracket generating , or even smooth , to define a reasonable subriemannian geometry .",
    "important examples of such distributions come from dynamical systems .",
    "let @xmath12 be a @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) of a smooth compact riemannian manifold @xmath1 .",
    "this means that @xmath15 is like an anosov diffeomorphism , but in addition to hyperbolic behavior ( i.e. , exponential contraction and exponential expansion ) , @xmath15 also exhibits weakly hyperbolic or non - hyperbolic behavior along certain tangent directions .",
    "more precisely , @xmath15 is partially hyperbolic if the tangent bundle of @xmath1 splits continuously and invariantly into the stable , center , and unstable bundles ( i.e. , distribution ) , @xmath16 such that the tangent map @xmath17 of @xmath15 exponentially contracts @xmath18 , exponentially expands @xmath19 and this hyperbolic action on @xmath20 dominates the action of @xmath17 on @xmath21 ( see @xcite ) . the stable and unstable bundle",
    "are always uniquely integrable , giving rise to the stable and unstable foliations , @xmath22 .",
    "a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism is ( rather unfortunately ) called if every two points of @xmath1 can be joined by an @xmath23-path , i.e. , a continuous piecewise smooth path consisting of finitely many arcs , each lying in a single leaf of @xmath24 or a single leaf of @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath15 is accessible , then the distribution @xmath20 is clearly non - integrable .",
    "dolgopyat and wilkinson  @xcite proved that in the space of @xmath13 ( @xmath26 ) partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms there is a @xmath27 open and dense set of accessible diffeomorphisms .",
    "since invariant distributions of a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism are in general only @xmath28 , for some @xmath29 ( see @xcite ) , this result shows that there is an abundance of subriemannian geometries defined by non - smooth , hlder continuous distributions .",
    "since these distributions play a crucial role in the dynamics of partially hyperbolic systems and the accessibility property is frequently key to ergodicity ( cf .",
    ", e.g. ,  @xcite ) , a better understanding of subriemannian geometries defined by hlder distributions could be very useful in dynamical systems .",
    "this paper provides a small initial step in that direction .    when @xmath2 is not smooth , the definition of nowhere integrability is more subtle than in the smooth case .",
    "one should keep in mind the following example ( we thank an anonymous referee for bringing it up ) : suppose @xmath2 is smooth and integrable in a neighborhood of a point @xmath30 and non - integrable elsewhere . since every two points can still be connected by a horizontal path , @xmath31 is finite everywhere .",
    "let @xmath32 be the leaf through @xmath30 of the local foliation of @xmath33 tangent to @xmath2 .",
    "then unless @xmath34 lies in @xmath32 , @xmath35 is bounded away from zero by a uniform constant , making the subriemannian distance discontinuous with respect to the riemannian distance for any riemannian metric on @xmath1 .",
