    "recently it was shown that superconductor / ferromagnet / superconductor ( s / f / s ) junctions made of @xmath8 , where the interlayer is weakly ferromagnetic ( @xmath9 0.54 ) , can support a supercurrent . moreover",
    ", the temperature dependence of the supercurrent shows a sharp cusp , which suggests that the junction changes from a 0-phase to a @xmath0-phase state at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "this implies that the superconducting order parameter induced in the ferromagnet is oscillatory damped , and also that the transparency of the interface is relatively high . a signature for this inhomogeneous state should also be visible in the t@xmath10-dependence of s / f multilayers as the function of the f - layer thickness d@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "specifically , t@xmath10 should go through a dip before reaching a maximum and going to an asymptotic value , under the condition , however , that the s - layer thickness d@xmath12 is of the order of the superconducting coherence length @xmath13 .",
    "the dip , which appears to be a stronger signature for the inhomogeneous state than the often searched - for maximum ( see e.g @xcite ) , signifies a self - interference effect of the inhomogeneous order parameter , and could be used to advantage in constructing a superconducting spin switch @xcite .",
    "the necessary conditions can be reached if the pair breaking by the ferromagnet is not too strong , so that the critical thickness @xmath14 of the superconductor is not ( much ) larger than @xmath13 . in principle , given the observation of supercurrents in nb / cu@xmath15ni@xmath16/nb , this system might also be a viable candidate for observing the interference effects . here",
    "we present results of the measurements of the magnetic and superconducting properties of nb / cu@xmath4ni@xmath5 for different @xmath6 .",
    "we show that @xmath14 even for these weak ferromagnets is high enough to make the predicted effects small .",
    "sets of single f - films , s / f bilayers and f / s / f trilayers were dc - magnetron sputtered in an ultra high vacuum system with base pressure 10@xmath17 mbar and sputtering argon pressure about 6 * 10@xmath18 mbar .",
    "cu@xmath4ni@xmath5 targets were used with @xmath6  = 0.60 , 0.50 and 0.45 atomic percent which yielded a somewhat different ni concentration in the samples  : @xmath6  = 0.67 , 0.59 and 0.52 respectively .",
    "the samples were measured by squid - magnetometry in order to determine the saturation magnetization @xmath19 and the curie temperature @xmath20 . for comparison",
    "we also measured a set of samples which were sputtered in an rf - sputtering system with a base pressure of 10@xmath21 mbar @xcite .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] shows the typical dependence of the magnetization @xmath22 on temperature @xmath23 for a single f - layer , using the following procedure : the sample was magnetized to its saturation at 10 k , then the field was removed ( or set to a small value ) , and @xmath24 was measured up to 300 k and back down to 10 k. @xmath20 was defined at the temperature where @xmath24 deviates from the constant value at high @xmath23 , which is usually slightly higher than where the hysteresis sets in . the negative part of the @xmath24 curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]b we associate with a small negative residual field in the cryostat .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] and table  1 show t@xmath25 and the magnetic moment @xmath26 of the cuni films as function of ni concentration . in the range",
    "@xmath6  = 0.52 - 0.59 , @xmath26 changes very little , with a stronger increase above @xmath6  = 0.6 . also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] is the behavior of the bulk magnetic moments according to ref .",
    "the agreement is quite satisfactory and the comparison makes clear that the small changes below @xmath6  = 0.6 accurately mimic the bulk behavior , where a kink in the linear dependence is found at that value .",
    "interestingly , t@xmath27 behaves somewhat differently , with a much larger variation .",
    "it suggests that t@xmath25 is a more sensitive measure for @xmath6 than @xmath26 .",
    "the dependence of the critical temperatures t@xmath10 on d@xmath28 of cu@xmath4ni@xmath5/nb / cu@xmath4ni@xmath5 sandwiches with thick f - layers ( 50 nm ) is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig3 ] for three ni concentration : @xmath6  = 0.52 , 0.59 and 0.67 .",
    "values for @xmath14 for all concentrations are presented in table  1 .",
    "there is hardly any dependence on ni concentration .",
    "the data for @xmath6  = 0.67 yield a slightly higher value for d@xmath29 while the data for @xmath6  = 0.59 even lie on the low-@xmath30 side of the data for @xmath6  = 0.52 , but for all sets measured , d@xmath29 is about 14 nm . in view of the small changes in @xmath26 found above , this indicates that @xmath26 is a better measure for the pair breaking effects in the f - layer than @xmath1 . using the value @xmath13",
    "= 8 nm for nb @xcite we find @xmath14/@xmath31 1.6 .",
    "this already implies that the signature of the inhomogeneous superconductivity , namely the dip in t@xmath10(d@xmath11 ) , can only be small @xcite .    for t@xmath10(d@xmath11 )",
    ", measurements were performed on two sets of s / f bilayers ( s - layer on the substrate side ) , one with ( s ) @xmath30 = 18 nm and ( f ) @xmath6  = 0.59 , the other with ( s ) @xmath30  = 12 nm and ( f ) @xmath6  = 0.52 .    the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4]a , b show a possible dip in the case of @xmath6  = 0.59 , but only a kink in the case of @xmath6  = 0.52 . given the small difference in @xmath26",
    "the similar behavior is not surprising .",
    "the absence of ( stronger ) dips is probably due to a combination of the still rather large value for @xmath14/@xmath13 and bandstructure effects , which make the interfaces less than fully transparent .",
    "also , growth conditions are very important , and smearing effects likely .",
    "a final remark concerns the value of @xmath2 where the kink is found , around 4  - 5  nm .",
    "it should be realized that this does not contradict the coupling thickness for reaching the @xmath0-state in s / f / s junctions of 15 - 20 nm : firstly , the @xmath3 data are on bilayers and therefore correspond to 8  - 10  nm for the trilayer case ; secondly because the weak magnetism results in a temperature dependence of @xmath32 @xcite .",
