    "many interesting phenomena only emerge at low temperatures@xcite , and as such it is often highly desirable to measure and/or image a sample below room temperature .",
    "in addition , the temperature dependence of raman features often reveals new information such as the strength of phonon anharmonicity crucial for thermal properties.@xcite for organic samples , low temperatures can immobilize the material in a near - native state , revealing much more detailed information about the samples and their interaction spectra.@xcite thus , numerous insights can be gained by measuring the temperature dependence of the raman response .",
    "typically , temperature control requires the use of cumbersome and expensive cryogenic liquids . for raman micro - spectroscopy",
    "this can be extremely challenging , due to a number of factors including the rapidly rising cost of helium , the low raman cross sections ( typically 10@xmath2 to 10@xmath3)@xcite , the requirement of high spatial and spectral resolution , as well as the need to use low laser power to prevent heating .",
    "this often creates a competing set of requirements , long integration times , the use of high numerical aperture ( na ) objectives with low working distances , minimized use of helium , the need to place the sample in vacuum , and the need to keep the objective at a fixed location / temperature . to date , this has led to two different designs of low - temperature raman microscopes .",
    "the first approach is to place the objective inside the cooling medium / vacuum , which enables high na , but requires cryo - compatible objectives and leads to strong temperature dependence of the objective s performance as well as its relative alignment with the sample .",
    "the second approach employs an intermediate n.a .",
    ", long working distance , glass compensated objective outside the cryostat .",
    "this results in higher mechanical stability of the objective , but at the cost of the spot size , polarization and especially the collection efficiency.@xcite in addition , one also desires to make systems as automated as possible to reduce the operational errors and enable higher temperature resolution . therefore ,",
    "there has been an increasing demand to implement an automated system with high collection efficiency , thermal and mechanical stability .    in this article",
    ", we describe a new raman microscope design , equipped with automated cryogenic temperature , laser power and polarization control as well as motorized imaging functions .",
    "temperature changes in our system are based on an automated closed - cycle cryostation , designed and manufactured by montana instruments inc . for raman excitation and collection ,",
    "a cryo optic module was employed , comprising a 100x , 0.9na microscope objective , installed inside the cryostation and kept at a constant temperature by a proportional - integral - derivative ( pid ) control loop .",
    "an agile temperature sample mount was designed and installed , ensuring fast thermal response ( less than 5 minutes from 4 k to 350 k ) as well as excellent cryostation platform mechanical ( 5 nm ) and thermal ( mks ) stability .",
    "in addition to the small spot size and excellent collection efficiency this enables the improved collimation by the objective , which provides excellent spectral resolution , stability , and rayleigh rejection with notch filters ( allowing signals down to 30 ) .",
    "moreover , nearly perfect polarization response can be measured at any in - plane angle using a fresnel rhomb .",
    "these combined features produce much more reliable measurements with long integration times and continuous experiments lasting multiple weeks without the need for human intervention .",
    "this opens the door to widespread use of cryogenic raman microscopy to probe nano - materials with low thermal conductivities and very weak raman responses .",
    "raman scattering or the raman effect is the inelastic scattering of a photon .",
    "the energy difference between the incoming and outgoing photons corresponds to an excitation energy within the measured materials , enabling the use of a single wavelength light source to probe multiple excitations of a material .",
    "the basic components of a raman microscope comprise a continuous wave laser , optical components to guide and focus the beam onto the sample , a laser filter , and a detector . after illuminating a sample , the elastic rayleigh as well as raman scattered light is collected by the same objective in the backscattering configuration.@xcite usually , the collected light must pass through a set of filters before entering a spectrometer because of the very small scattering cross - section of the raman processes.@xcite    in raman experiments , one often employs group theory to determine the symmetry of the mode measured .",
    "specifically , the mode intensity is given by a raman tensor ( @xmath4 ) and the polarization of the incoming ( @xmath5 ) and outgoing ( @xmath6 ) light .",
    "indeed , the crystallographic axes are the bases of @xmath4 and the intensity is given by : @xmath7 therefore by measuring the raman response for various configurations of @xmath8 as well as at different angles with respect to the sample , one can gain insights into the symmetry of the excitations and determine the crystallographic orientation.@xcite",
    "+      we now describe in detail the overall design and layout of our raman cryo - microscope system , which is shown in in fig . [",

    "our raman setup starts with a laser source ( the laser beam is shown by the red beams in fig . [",
    "fig : raman_setup ] ) . to achieve high spatial and spectral resolution , a laser quantum torus 532 nm laser with a ghz - bandwidth was used for the excitation .",
    "a true zero - order half waveplate ( hw1 ) mounted on a motorized universal rotator and a cubic polarizer ( p1 ) were placed after the laser .",
    "since the rotation of the half waveplate will induce a change in the polarization of the laser , the laser power after p1 can be effectively adjusted by rotating hw1 , while maintaining the same polarization at the sample .",
    "in addition , the thinness of hw1 minimizes changes in the direction of the laser beampath upon changing the power .",
    "a second true zero - order half waveplate ( hw2 ) was placed after p1 , such that the measurement configuration could be switched between collinear ( xx ) and crossed ( xy ) polarizations . following the optical path and several silver mirrors ( m ) ,",
    "the laser was directed to a diffractive 90/10 beamsplitter ( dbs ) from ondax inc , reflecting 90 % of the excitation source , and rejecting 90% of rayleigh scattered light after exciting the sample .",
    "the laser is then guided towards a cryostation . before entering the cryostation ,",

    "is added for a total @xmath9 phase .",
    "thus , rotating the polarization of incoming laser(shown in red ) can be achieved through the rotation of @xmath10 fresnel rhomb ( fr ) .",
    "the blue lines are both raman scattered lights and rayleigh scattered lights .",
    "half waveplate ( hw2 ) , analyzer ( p2 ) , 90/10 beam splitter ( dbs ) , objective ( o).@xcite for clarity , the guiding mirrors between hw2 and dbs are omitted here .",

    "fig : raman_setup ] about the shared beampath ) is collected by the objective inside the cryostation and follows the incoming path .",
    "the raman scattered light passes through the and the analyzer ( p2 ) after the 90/10 beamsplitter , as shown in fig.[rhomb_figure ] . as mentioned above , the selection rules provide symmetry information about the excitation as well as the crystallographic axes . however , to achieve this without the",
    ", one would have to rotate the sample , resulting in the loss of focus , lateral displacement of the beam with respect to the sample , and adding more complexity to the setup .",
    "another method would be to simultaneously rotate components hw2 and p2 ( analyzer / polarizer ) .",
    "however , the diffraction grating in the spectrometer is most efficient for a fixed polarization ( s - polarization , detailed discussion will be given in sec .",
    "[ sec : charac ] ) .",
    "thus , rotating p2 would inadvertently affect the signal , even for an isotropic raman tensor .",
    "the optimal result can be achieved by a double - loop search method .",
    "basically , one can rotate hw2 by a small amount @xmath11 , then rotate p2 while monitoring the signal level of the rayleigh scattered lights to find the maximum counts , repeating until the counts are optimized . by introducing the , one can fix p2 to optimize the efficiency of the spectrometer , manipulate hw2 to change from cross to co - polarized configuration and use the to effectively rotate the sample s crystallographic axes about the fixed axes of the optical system .    to reject rayleigh scattered light , and to reach a cut - off energy of 30 , two ondax sureblock volume holographic bragg grating based diffractive notch filters ( dnf ) were placed after the analyzer . using a notch filter as opposed to commonly used edge filters",
    "also allows both stokes and anti - stokes raman signals to be recorded , which is a useful indicator to test local heating of the sample.@xcite these two filters plus dbs result in od 8 attenuation to the rayleigh scattered light .",
    "finally , the raman scattered light is directed to a sine - drive spectrometer module equipped with an ultra - high resolution 2400 grooves / mm holographic grating . prior to entering the spectrometer the light passes through an external mechanical slit mounted on a 3-axis translation stage .",
    "this allows for maximum resolution and collection efficiency by positioning the slit at the focal point of the first lens inside the spectrometer . to reduce chromatic and spherical aberration effects , anti - reflection coated achromatic doublet lens ( al ) with focal length of 50 mm ( thorlabs , inc .",
    "ac254 - 050-a - ml ) was used to focus the light onto the slit .",
    "ultimately , the diffracted light is detected by an andor idus back illumination spectroscopy ccd .",
    "the detector operates in sub - image bin mode and at the lowest rate adc ( analog - digital - conversion ) channel to reduce the noise level .    to bring samples into focus during measurements , and for finding features and/or micron sized samples on a substrate ,",
    "imaging the sample is necessary . to get more repeatable images ,",
    "our raman microscope is equipped with computer controlled white light illumination and imaging capabilities ( all parts denoted in red in fig .",
    "[ fig : raman_setup ] ) .",
    "illumination lights ( shown by the green beam in fig .[fig : raman_setup ] ) are delivered using a multi - mode fibre through a fiber coupler ( fc ) to a condenser ( cds ) and then reflected by a beamsplitter ( bs ) towards a cubic beamsplitter ( cbs ) .",
    "a home - built motorized long range translation stage was used to move the cbs in / out of ( shown by the transparent and opaque cbs respectively , in fig .",
    "[ fig : raman_setup ] ) the beampath for imaging ( raman signal collection ) .",
    "the cbs was fixed on a linear ball bearing carrier . a nema 17 stepper motor ( sm ) coupled with a 1/4 - 20 acme threaded shaft was used for the translation of the linear ball bearing carrier .",
    "the motion of the motor was controlled by a computer interfaced arduino uno microcontroller and a motor shield .",
    "two microswitches connected to the uno were used as stoppers for the carrier . when the cbs is moved into the beampath ,",
    "the illumination lights share the same beampath as the laser and is directed onto samples .",
    "after illumination , the reflected light followed the incoming path to the cbs , then is transmitted ( shown by the gold beam in fig .",
    "[ fig : raman_setup ] ) through the bs and ultimately directed by a mirror ( m ) through a lens with 15 cm focal length to form an image on a thorlabs cmos camera ( cmos ) .                    to focus the excitation source on our sample , and collect ( anti- )",
    "stokes shifted radiation , we used a modified 100x , 0.90 na zeiss objective with a working distance of 310 @xmath12 m , vented to operate in vacuum .",
    "the commercially available closed cycle montana instruments cryostation is equipped with a cryo optic module that was developed in collaboration with the burch group , and designed to mount the zeiss objective .",
    "the cryostation includes a low vibration ( @xmath135 nm peak - to - peak ) cold platform ( @xmath133.5 k ) for the sample , and a sample radiation shield ( see fig . [ fig : cryochamber ] ) .",
    "the radiation shield reduces radiative thermal loads on the sample , and serves as a thermal anchor for lagging wires that enter the sample space .",
    "built - in attocube 101-series xyz nanopositioners handle sample translation and focusing , providing 5 mm of translation range with sub - micron resolution .",
    "the cryo optic module mounts directly onto the radiation shield ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cryochamber ] ) so that the aperture separating the sample and the objective is cooled to 60 k. moreover , the direct mechanical coupling of the objective and sample space inside the vacuum chamber ensure a stable focal plane with respect to the sample ; an important requirement for long integration times , and difficult to achieve with an objective mounted outside of the vacuum chamber .",
    "this rigid mechanical connection is pivotal for the high na objective , as the depth of focus is inversely proportional to the square of the na@xcite . with the 532 nm excitation source , a spot size of @xmath14",
    "is achieved , as optically observed , and confirmed by the diameter of holes purposely burned into bi@xmath15se@xmath16 flakes .",
    "the combination of a small spot size , high na , and high mechanical stability solves some of the key challenges in temperature dependent raman investigations of novel samples as small crystal size , low heat capacity , and weak raman signals require high lateral and axial resolution as well as low excitation power and thus long integration times .",
    "a cross - section of the mechanical design of the cryo optic module is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cryochamber ] .",
    "alignment of the objective with respect to the 50 @xmath12 m thick beryllium copper aperture is achieved by attaching a reference surface to the bottom of the aperture plane and employing the previously described white light imaging capabilities of the system .",
    "the threaded copper rings to which the objective is mounted are rotated until the reference surface is in focus , and are subsequently locked in place . after installing the cryo optic module onto the radiation shield",
    ", the sample is brought into focus using the nanopositioners described above .",
    "a key feature of the cryo optic module is the thermal isolation of the zeiss objective and the 60 k aperture .",
    "this allows for a closed loop temperature controlled objective ( kept at 310 @xmath17 0.5 k ) while the 60 k aperture limits the radiative heatload of the objective to a fraction of the cryostation cooling power at 4 k. moreover , with such careful temperature control , the objective and sample are impervious to typical environmental temperature fluctuations and the objective s optical performance is unaffected by the sample temperature .",
    "hence , drift of the sample with respect to the objective is limited only by the thermal contraction and expansion of the cryostation base platform , the nanopositioners , and the sample mount . to further reduce this drift ,",
    "a sample stage was developed by montana instruments in collaboration with the burch group that can change temperature nearly independent of the cryostation platform and the nanopositioners , which is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : atsm ] .      to achieve high mechanical and thermal stability of the sample platform ,",
    "an agile temperature sample mount ( atsm ) was developed and integrated into the raman microscope .",
    "[ fig : heatloadcycle]c shows two pictures of the atsm , in which a 500 @xmath18 thick copper sample platform is surrounded by a 4 k radiation shield , and is radially supported just below the platform by g-10 thermal stand - offs .",
    "this platform thickness and support geometry with rotational symmetry results in minimal drift in the focal plane of the microscope , and strongly enhances in - plane positional stability . for minimal error in sample temperature readings ,",
    "a cernox cx-1050-ht is mounted on the bottom of the platform , thus separated from the sample by a 500 @xmath18 layer of oxygen - free high thermal conductivity copper ( ofhc ) .",
    "moreover , the sample platform is equipped with closed loop controlled solid state heating elements ( chip resistors in dead - bug configuration ) for highly isotropic heat exchange and temperature control .",
    "this allows for precise temperature control over the sample platform , nearly independent of the cryostation base platform , which maintains a temperature between 3 - 14 k over the full 4 - 350 k range of the atsm . hence , while cycling between temperatures , the thermal stability outside of the atsm platform is only minimally affected , reducing thermal drifts within the system s radiation shield and housing over longer time - scales . as a result , a comparison of measurements taken before and after installing the atsm revealed over an order of magnitude improvement in the time that is required to reach a stable temperature and position .",
    "this was determined both by temperature readings and producing a focused image between temperature changes .",
    "this is in part due to the agile temperature response of the stage ( as described below ) , and in part due to the rapid thermal stability of the atsm and optical train , as the temperature change and thermal expansions / contractions settle rapidly due to the minimal mass .",
    "[ fig : xyzstability]a illustrates the positional stability in the @xmath19-plane and along the @xmath20-axis , where @xmath20 is parallel to the poynting vector of the laser .",
    "these data were obtained by cooling down an nt - mdt scanning probe microscope ( spm ) calibration grating ( model tgz3 ) with a period of 3 @xmath18 . using the closed loop positioners , a white light image of the grating was kept in focus and centered on the screen throughout the cooldown .",
    "all required _ xyz _ displacements as a function of temperature were recorded and plotted in fig . [ fig : xyzstability]a . beyond overall stability , one may worry about vibrations caused by the closed - cycle system .",
    "this potential effect on the optical system was minimized by placing the optics on a separate platform from the cryostation , though on the same optical table . the effect on the raman signal",
    "was checked by collecting raman spectra of a sample at room temperature with the cryostation compressor turned on and with it turned off .",
    "no significant difference was observed .",
    "furthermore , the overall design of the cryostation and the atsm minimizes the effects of vibration on the sample , as was measured using a lion precision cpl490 capacitive displacement sensor . with the atsm mounted on top of the positioners stack , and with the cryostation compressor running at high power , the room temperature in - plane ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) vibrations did not exceed 60 nm , and are thus well below the diffraction limit of our 532 nm excitation source . while vibrations along the poynting vector ( @xmath20-axis ) were not measured with the capacitive displacement sensor , they are unlikely to exceed the in - plane vibrations as a result of the positioner stage stack construction .",
    "white light imaging of the above mentioned spm calibration grating ( while the compressor was running ) confirmed that mechanical vibrations along @xmath20 were below the axial resolution of our system as no defocussing was observed .",
    "vibrations of the atsm were also measured in isolation of the positioners , while mounted directly to the cryostation platform . in this arrangement",
    ", peak - to - peak vibrations did not exceed 5 nm , and an atsm platform resonance frequency of 8.2 khz was found .    the thermal stability of the atsm platform is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xyzstability]b , where each temperature point was recorded over a period of 20 minutes .",
    "we note that while the conventionally large sample platform mass passively aids thermal damping , the _ low drift",
    "_ geometrical constraints of the atsm ( and thus it s low mass ) force it to strictly rely on a finely tuned pid loop for thermal stability , in addition to the thermal stability of the cryostation .",
    "indeed , with the low platform mass of the atsm , and high thermal conductivity of ofhc copper below 50 k,@xcite we observed temperature changes @xmath23 in excess of 100 k / s at low temperatures , thus imposing stringent requirements on the frequency and i / o resolution of the pid control algorithm .",
    "a lakeshore 335 temperature controller was used to meet these pid requirements .",
    "our observed decline in thermal stability below 50 k coincides with a large jump in the thermal conductivity of copper , and is thus attributed to a sub - optimally tuned temperature control loop .",
    "nevertheless , thermal stability over the full temperature range never exceeds 4.5 mk rms ( 32 mk peak - to - peak ) , which easily meets the requirements for raman microscopy , even at high temperature resolution , as shown in section [ sec : charac ] .",
    "it is important to note that while the ultimate goal of the atsm is positional and thermal stability , its design also leads to a reduction in sample cooling power compared to the cryostation base platform .",
    "this concern was addressed by optimizing the thermal standoff of the atsm platform so that it can easily withstand typical radiative heatloads ( 0.1 mw ) of the raman excitation source by several orders of magnitude , while maintaining a low base temperature .",
    "[ fig : heatloadcycle]a shows a log - log heatload map of the atsm over the full temperature range , emphasizing its low temperature cooling power .",
    "in addition to stability , the design of the atsm also allows for highly agile temperature control , resulting in minimal time loss between temperature set - points . to illustrate this agility , fig .",
    "[ fig : heatloadcycle]b shows a number of 20 minute thermal cycles between 4 - 350 k , stabilizing down to @xmath24 mk rms at both extremes of the cycle .",
    "to demonstrate the performance of our setup , we measured two challenging samples , bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "they are of wide interest for applications in thermoelectric and memristive devices as well as their topological insulating ( bi@xmath0se@xmath1)@xcite and strongly correlated behavior ( v@xmath0o@xmath1)@xcite .",
    "the first data set was obtained from single crystal bi@xmath0se@xmath1 as it is of interest to a wide range of researchers such as those working in topological insulator , thermoelectric and nano materials .",
    "of particular interest is the potential for the temperature dependence of its phonons to unravel the origin of its low thermal conductivity.@xcite however the low thermal conductivity which makes it an excellent thermoelectric , also forces one to keep the laser power extremely low to avoid local heating .",
    "thus , if the collection efficiency is not high enough , getting a sufficient signal to noise ratio is extremely challenging . besides",
    ", the raman response of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is well characterized , making it a good sample to test the capability of our system.@xcite the sample was freshly cleaved just before being placed into the sample chamber .",

    "excellent signal to noise is observed at all temperatures , despite the low raman response and thermal conductivity of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ]    we can see there are three phonon peaks visible in the whole temperature range .",
    "they are located at 71.7 @xmath27 , 131.5 @xmath27 and 174.0 @xmath27 at 271 k , in agreement with previous studies.@xcite to confirm the absence of local laser heating , we exploit the well known relationship between the ratio of the stokes(s ) and anti - stokes(as ) intensity and the local temperature , given by : @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the phonon energy and @xmath30 the local temperature .",
    "thus we expect a linear relationship between the sample temperature and the inverse of the log of this ratio . the absence of local heating is indeed demonstrated in fig . [ ratio_ans_s ] where we plot the @xmath31^{-1}$ ] versus t for the lowest energy mode ( 71.7@xmath32 ) .",

    "however , due to the low signal level , nanometer sized domains and narrow temperature range in which the transition occurs , raman measurements are very challenging and require very long integration times . usually , for measurements like this , one would have to sacrifice the temperature resolution and signal to noise ratio for helium cost and thermal drifts .",
