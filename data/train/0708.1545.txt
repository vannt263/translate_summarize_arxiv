    "the luminosity function ( lf ) of galaxies varies substantially with respect to many key physical parameters such as galaxy morphology , environment , color , star formation rate , surface brightness , and redshift .",
    "these many differences serve as powerful diagnostics of the broad tapestry of galaxy evolution .",
    "the most important requirement for the accurate derivation of galaxy lfs are large , complete samples of galaxies with reliable photometry and redshift determinations .",
    "the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ; @xcite ) contains not only the largest contiguous area of the sky yet observed with the hubble space telescope , but also deep multiwavelength imaging across the entire 2 cosmos field ( @xcite ) .",
    "cosmos thus affords deep , homogeneous photometric and photometric redshift coverage for a sample of some @xmath11 galaxies  complementing well at higher redshifts the largest galaxy surveys of the relatively nearby universe with which galaxy lfs have been derived , such as the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; @xcite ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) .",
    "comprehensive analyses of the lf characteristics of the entire cosmos galaxy sample will ultimately be forthcoming , with the completion of the spectroscopic portion of the survey ( @xcite ) and the continued addition and refinement of the photometric and photometric redshift measurements in multiple bandpasses ( @xcite ) .",
    "already , though , it is feasible to address important scientific questions about galaxy lfs with the current optical and near - infrared multiband data ( @xcite ) in conjunction with the hubble space telescope @xmath12 broad - band acs imaging ( @xcite ) .    one particular component of the field galaxy lf , the faint end ( @xmath13 ) of the lf at low to intermediate ( @xmath14 ) redshifts , is uniquely well - suited for analysis with the cosmos data .",
    "this population of galaxies lies in an apparent magnitude range somewhat beyond the 2dfgrs and sdss survey limits ; they are too faint for spectroscopic observations , with redshifts too low to be included in surveys optimized for high - redshift galaxies . yet , exploring these galaxies contribution to the overall lf is critical for understanding galaxy evolution during the latter half of cosmic history .",
    "recent comprehensive studies of field galaxy lf evolution have focused on the luminosity evolution of the bright end ( @xmath15 ) . there",
    ", some consensus appears to be gradually emerging about the extent of that evolution .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite all find a brightening of @xmath16 by @xmath17 magnitude between @xmath18 . in shorter - wavelength bandpasses ,",
    "the luminosity evolution is more pronounced , while at longer wavelengths it appears to be weaker and possibly even in the negative sense , dimming in the near - infrared @xmath19-band from @xmath20 to @xmath21 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the evolution of the faint - end slope , however , remains highly uncertain . at low redshifts ,",
    "results from the sloan digital sky survey ( @xcite ) , the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( @xcite ) , and other datasets such as that from the century survey ( @xcite ) and the galex mission ( @xcite ) roughly agree , for example , on a moderate slope of @xmath5 . beyond redshifts of a few tenths , the faint - end slope becomes very difficult to address , mainly because the number of low - luminosity galaxies detected in galaxy surveys decreases dramatically with increasing redshift . despite a number of efforts to measure evolution in the faint - end slope at redshifts less than @xmath22 ( @xcite ) ,",
    "very little is known for galaxies fainter than @xmath23 .",
    "this is in part because the relationship between the bright - end and faint - end characteristics of galaxy lfs is not straightforward , often resulting in a tradeoff between the precision lf evolution measurements at the two ends . @xcite and @xcite , for example , each select fixed lf faint - end slopes based on galaxies brighter than @xmath23 , and",
    "use that constraint throughout their bright - end evolution measurements .",
    "whether or not the faint - end slope evolves with redshift , however , it is clear that its steepness varies widely for galaxies of different morphological and spectral types , indicating substantial differences in the evolutionary histories of galaxies . broadly speaking , irregular galaxies , `` blue '' galaxies , and strongly star - forming galaxies  three significantly overlapping galaxy sub - populations  evolve more strongly than galaxies of other types .",
    "such galaxies are characterized by very steep faint - end lf slopes and substantial evolution in luminosity and/or number density at even moderate redshifts of @xmath24 ( @xcite ) .",
    "more recent work has further confirmed and quantified this trend at higher redshifts ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . at low redshifts ,",
    "evidence is mounting that composite parameterizations may more accurately reflect the shape of the lf than the usual single - function ones ( @xcite ) ; and that faintward of @xmath23 , the power - law slope of the lf may differ quantitatively from the slope brightward of that threshold ( @xcite ) .",
    "this could arise , for example , due to large numbers of low - luminosity `` blue '' galaxies ( @xcite ) or low surface brightness galaxies ( @xcite ) which may have previously evaded detection .    in this paper",
    ", we present measurements of the faint - end slopes of the rest - frame v - band luminosity functions of galaxies in the cosmos survey at @xmath14 , focusing in particular on the change in that slope as a function of redshift and galaxy spectral type .",
    "the depth and breadth of the cosmos multiband photometry allows for reliable identifications of galaxy redshift and spectral type , with robust redshift error estimates for each galaxy , to a limit of @xmath25 in the optical passbands .",
    "even so , the relatively large and varying redshift uncertainties of photometric redshifts can present substantial quantitative challenges and systematic biases ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use monte carlo simulations to characterize these biases , and to recover the faint - end slopes of galaxy - type specific lfs .",
    "this work represents an initial study of the general properties of these type - specific faint - end lf slopes , to provide quantitative comparisons with the results of other large field galaxy surveys .",
    "studies of the bright - end evolution of the galaxy lf from the cosmos survey are given elsewhere ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; and a more detailed breakdown of the @xmath14 galaxy population by redshift , galaxy spectral type , and galaxy morphology will be presented in a future paper ( liu et al . , in preparation ) .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt a flat cosmology with @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 km s@xmath29 mpc@xmath29 .",
    "in our analysis , we use a compilation of the cosmos optical / near - infrared data ( @xcite ) , which includes observations with hst advanced camera for surveys ( @xmath12 ) , the subaru telescope ( @xmath30 ) , the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( @xmath31 ) , and the 4-meter kpno mayall and ctio blanco telescopes ( @xmath32 ) , as well as supplementary data from the sloan digital sky survey . the data from the different telescopes were all matched to a common pixel scale and smoothed to the same point source function .",
    "sextractor ( @xcite ) was then used in dual mode to generate a photometric catalog , selected using the subaru @xmath33 and cfht @xmath34 images .",
    "the limiting 3@xmath35 ab magnitude is @xmath36 .",
    "a detailed description of the imaging data , photometry , and photometric calibration are given in @xcite .",
    "photometric redshifts for individual galaxies were computed using the methods described in @xcite .",
    "six basic galaxy spectral types , adapted from the four template types  e , sbc , scd , and i m  from @xcite , and the starburst templates sb2 and sb3 of @xcite , were used . these templates are presented graphically in figure [ seds ] . these galaxy spectral types are derived from empirical data , and represent the range of non - agn galaxy spectral energy distributions ( seds ) from redder to bluer colors ; these starburst seds , for example , represent very blue galaxies not significantly reddened or obscured by dust .",
    "interpolation was used between the six spectral types to produce a grid of 31 possible galaxy sed fits .",
    "using the multiband photometry , the cosmos photometric redshift code ( @xcite ) was used to derive a photometric redshift @xmath37 for each galaxy , with 68% and 95% confidence intervals computed above and below that value . to determine the accuracy of the code , @xmath38 values",
    "were compared with spectroscopic redshifts ( @xmath39 ) in 868 galaxies with @xmath40 and @xmath41 with secure redshift measurements from the _ z_cosmos survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "the galaxy spectral types ( 20% early - type , 63% spiral , 17% starburst ) are evenly distributed with redshift in the spectroscopic sample , and about half of the sample ( 45% ) is at @xmath42 .    the detailed statistics of the @xmath37 and @xmath43 comparisons are described in @xcite , primarily in terms of the parameter @xmath44 . as given in table 4 and figure 5 of @xcite ,",
    "the nominal dispersion between these photometric redshifts and spectroscopically determined redshifts was rms ( @xmath45 ) @xmath46 for non - agn galaxies .",
    "with respect to the different spectral types , @xcite showed that early - type , spiral , and starburst galaxies have rms @xmath47 0.034 , 0.030 , and 0.042 respectively .",
    "we chose to compute our luminosity functions using the @xmath48-band data for this study .",
    "the saturation limit for bright objects in that image was @xmath49 , and the 3@xmath35 faint - detection limit was @xmath50 ; so we conservatively chose as our apparent magnitude range @xmath51 .",
    "details of the photometry are described in @xcite .",
    "a rest - frame absolute @xmath52 magnitude , based on the derived @xmath37 and using the k - correction for the best - fit spectral type , was computed for each galaxy .",
    "ground and space - based images of a representative subsample of the faintest galaxies ( @xmath53 and fainter ) in this sample are presented in figure [ imgs ] .",
    "as with all surveys which rely primarily on photometric rather than spectroscopic redshifts , the application of the cosmos galaxy sample to the derivation of galaxy lfs requires great care to account for both random and systematic errors in the redshift determinations .",
    "just as methods of computing photometric redshifts have evolved and improved ( @xcite ) , so too have techniques to quantify and compensate for the effects of relatively large redshift error bars in lf calculations ( @xcite ) .    in this work ,",
    "we adapt the method used in @xcite , updating it with additional components similar to those used in more recent studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) to reproduce the faint - end slope of the lfs of cosmos galaxies .",
    "our strategy is based on the 1/@xmath54 method ( @xcite ) , which is well described by @xcite as a maximum likelihood method for estimating a luminosity function without assuming any parametric form .",
    "we account for photometric redshift errors by weighting the galaxies as probability - smoothed luminosity distributions at the redshifts where they are measured .",
    "consider a galaxy with an apparent magnitude @xmath55 in a passband @xmath56 , and redshift @xmath57 .",
    "if @xmath35=0 , then the absolute magnitude is    @xmath58 = @xmath59 5 log(d@xmath60 ) @xmath61 25.0 @xmath62    where d@xmath60 is the luminosity distance in megaparsecs , and @xmath63 is the k - correction at that redshift , in that passband , for the spectral energy distribution of the galaxy .",
    "the contribution of that galaxy to the luminosity distribution is then a delta function of amplitude unity at redshift @xmath64 .    in the case where @xmath65 0 , and the error distribution is gaussian",
    ", the galaxy can be thought of as adding a series of fractional contributions to the luminosity distribution in the redshift space surrounding @xmath64 .",
    "such a fraction at , for example , redshift @xmath66 and with a differential redshift width @xmath67 , would have an absolute magnitude    @xmath68 = @xmath59 5 log(d@xmath69 ) @xmath61 25.0 @xmath70    and have an amplitude    n@xmath71 = p@xmath72 / a@xmath73    where p@xmath74 and a@xmath74 are the gaussian probability function and its integral , respectively ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for the photometric redshifts of the cosmos survey , the redshift error distribution is not gaussian , but rather can be modeled as two half - gaussians ( @xcite ) , where the 68% confidence interval on the lower and upper limits are @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively . for a galaxy which a photometric redshift @xmath37 , the amplitude of the luminosity contribution function would be    n@xmath71 = p@xmath77 / a@xmath78    for @xmath79 , and    n@xmath71 = p@xmath80 / a@xmath81    for @xmath82 .",
    "this `` fuzzing '' of a galaxy s luminosity distribution in redshift space is straightforwardly achieved numerically , with a choice of @xmath83 to minimize random magnitude errors . for this cosmos dataset",
    ", we used @xmath84 = 0.02 @xmath85 and @xmath86 = 0.02 @xmath87 .",
    "this divides each galaxy into a gaussian - weighted luminosity distribution with 300 bins , from @xmath883@xmath85 to @xmath893@xmath87 .",
    "the entire distribution for each galaxy is normalized to unity .    in the standard 1/v@xmath90 method",
    ", each galaxy contributes a weight to the luminosity function equal to the inverse of the accessible volume within which it can be observed .",
    "the accessible volume , referred to here as v@xmath90 , is the total comoving volume within the redshift boundaries of the sample , where the given galaxy could be and fall within the selection criteria of the sample . in our case , the relevant criteria are the bright and faint apparent magnitude limits , and the effective solid angle of the cosmos survey .    in the case of a probability - weighted luminosity distribution for individual objects ,",
    "it is straightforward to compute v@xmath90 for each fractional galaxy ; correspondingly , its contribution to the luminosity function is ( 1/v@xmath90 ) @xmath91 n@xmath71 .",
    "assembling the luminosity function is then a matter of summing those contributions within absolute magnitude bins .",
    "since the primary goal of this work was to examine the lf faint - end slope , the upper redshift boundary was determined mainly by our desire to sample with high completeness at least as faint as @xmath92 in the entire redshift range . for a typical galaxy in the sample , depending on the galaxy s k - correction ,",
    "this corresponds roughly to @xmath93 .",
    "but because each galaxy s luminosity is calculated as a probability - weighted distribution , there is a statistically significant contribution to the lf more than a full magnitude beyond the formal absolute magnitude limit .",
    "thus , with the caveat that we are beyond that limit , we were also able to derive faint - end slopes of the lfs of galaxies in the redshift range @xmath94 .",
    "similarly , at the low redshift range , we are also able to measure fainter in absolute magnitude than the formally faintest detectable galaxy . however , to avoid large systematic magnitude errors and biases from structure in the local universe , we set a lower redshift bound of @xmath95 for deriving the lfs .",
    "this meant that we have statistically meaningful luminosity contributions to the lfs down to an absolute magnitude of @xmath96 for @xmath97 .    within our apparent magnitude limits of @xmath98 ,",
    "the cosmos survey photometric and @xmath37 catalog ( @xcite ) contains 49,161 galaxies in the redshift range @xmath99 . below and above this redshift range , however , there are galaxies within the apparent magnitude limits whose probability - smoothed luminosity distributions contribute to the light within that range . using @xmath100 to denote the width of the 68% confidence interval for @xmath37 , we thus also include the contributions of all other galaxies whose luminosity distribution tails fall within @xmath101 .",
    "( for example , a galaxy with @xmath102 and @xmath103 would contribute the portion of its luminosity distribution from @xmath104 , while a galaxy with @xmath105 and @xmath103 would contribute from @xmath106 . )",
    "there are 31,659 galaxies in the catalog that make such a partial contribution ; even though many of those galaxies add only a tiny fraction of a galaxy into the @xmath107 redshift range , we include them in our analysis for statistical completeness .",
    "thus , a total of 80,820 galaxies are included in the sample used to derive the lfs .    to check how the inclusion of these galaxies might affect the distribution of @xmath37 accuracy in the sample as a whole",
    ", we created a subset of the 80,820-galaxy sample where the galaxies have a @xmath100 of at most 0.1 .",
    "this subset of 41,237 galaxies ( 51% of the entire sample ) effectively contains objects whose @xmath100 are no more than 3 times the rms @xmath108 of the spectroscopically tested accuracy of the cosmos @xmath37 code .",
    "we then computed the mean , median , and rms of the @xmath109 values for the 41,237 , 49,161 , and 80,820 galaxy samples .",
    "we give the results in table 1 .",
    "as might be expected , the median , mean , and rms values all increase as the constraints in redshift and @xmath100 are lifted and the sample sizes grow .",
    "the median @xmath109 value increases only modestly on an absolute numerical basis ( 0.042 to 0.043 to 0.052 ) ; the mean and rms increase more substantially .",
    "computing lfs using `` fuzzy '' galaxies with photometric redshifts is clearly vulnerable to a set of systematic errors that would not be present for a galaxy sample with secure spectroscopic redshifts . in this work ,",
    "we use the standard galaxy lf parameterization of @xcite , where @xmath110 is the characteristic magnitude , @xmath111 the characteristic number density , and @xmath10 the faint - end slope ( @xcite ) :    @xmath112 dm\\ ] ]    in any given redshift bin , objects near the peak of the lf  that is , near @xmath113  will have part of their light distributed toward brighter magnitudes ; and objects at the bright and faint end of the galaxy sample will have their light scattered still further .",
    "this would cause an overestimate of those parts of the lf which contribute the least light .",
    "additionally , as the luminosity contributions of the galaxies are distributed across a large redshift range , light from galaxies inside a given redshift bin will sometimes be scattered out of that bin ; and since lower-@xmath64 redshift bins have smaller volumes than higher-@xmath64 ones , there is the risk that more light would be added into lower - redshift bins than would be removed from them .",
    "this could bias the distribution of derived absolute magnitudes in those bins .",
    "we quantify and correct for these errors using monte carlo simulations in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "for an arbitrary fixed @xmath113 and @xmath111 , we created populations of galaxies that followed schechter functions with faint - end slopes ranging from @xmath114 . for each @xmath10",
    ", we populated a simulated cosmos survey volume with the corresponding galaxy population .",
    "we then `` detected '' these galaxies based on the magnitude and redshift limits of our survey ; and for each galaxy detected , we randomly added an error to the redshift of that galaxy consistent with the measured dispersion of the cosmos photometric redshift catalog , rms ( @xmath115 .",
    "finally , we assigned to that galaxy a @xmath100 equal to the median @xmath100 of the 80,820-galaxy sample , i.e. @xmath116 .",
    "the lf for this simulated galaxy sample was then computed using the modified @xmath117 method described above .",
    "we generated 150 such simulated lfs for each @xmath10 tested .",
    "to illustrate the results of these simulations , we present three sets of them in figure [ alphas ] .",
    "the dashed lines show the input faint - end slopes ( @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) for the simulations . of the 150 simulations ,",
    "we exclude the four outliers furthest above and four furthest below the input @xmath10 ; the remaining 142 simulations ( i.e. 95% ) yield results that fall within the envelope bounded by the solid lines above and below each dashed line .",
    "the @xmath10 represented by each of those solid and dashed lines is given in the figure .",
    "as figure [ alphas ] shows , the `` fuzzing '' of the galaxies due to @xmath38 uncertainties does cause systematic biases of the calculated faint - end lf slope . at @xmath120 ,",
    "the bias is negligible , and the fuzzing basically just increases the uncertainty of the measured slope . for steeper input @xmath10 , however , the output @xmath10 is quantitatively biased toward steeper values ; and for shallower input @xmath10 , the opposite is true",
    ". the bias increases as input values of @xmath10 grow more extreme ; an input of @xmath121 , for example , produces output @xmath10 in a 95% envelope ranging from @xmath122 , whereas an input of @xmath123 produces corresponding output of @xmath124 .    from all the simulation results ,",
    "standard bootstrap methods were used to estimate the expected systematic offsets in @xmath10 for an actually observed galaxy population .",
    "these offsets were then used to correct the computed luminosity functions , to recover the original faint - end slopes of the galaxy samples in each redshift bin .",
    "this correction affects the overall slope only , and is not intended to remove any inherent , non - power law structure in the observed lf .",
    "also , this correction strategy was optimized to recover the faint - end slope , rather than the characteristic magnitude @xmath110 or the number density normalization @xmath111 ( as was done , for example , in @xcite ) .",
    "we thus do not attempt to measure those parameters in this work .",
    "accurate measurement of those values for the cosmos survey are presented , for a slightly different galaxy spectral type classification scheme , by @xcite .",
    "the measured luminosity functions for the entire galaxy sample , corrected for this bias in @xmath10 , are presented in figure [ lfs_1 ] . only the faint ends of the lfs , operationally defined here as galaxies fainter than @xmath125 ,",
    "are presented .",
    "lfs were calculated in five redshift bins : @xmath97 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath94 .",
    "additionally , we divided the galaxies into four subsamples according to galaxy spectral type : type 1 ( ellipticals ) , type 2 ( sbc ) , types 3 and 4 combined ( scd + irr ) , and types 5 and 6 combined ( low - extinction starbursts ) .",
    "for each subsample , lfs were also calculated in the same five redshift bins .",
    "the results are presented in figure [ lfs_abcd ] .",
    "there are three primary sources of errors in the lfs : ( 1 ) the systematic error in the lf slope and absolute magnitude determinations , described in the text above and characterized using simulations ; ( 2 ) a poisson - like error which derives naturally from the modified @xmath117 method , which is the reciprocal of the square root of the total number of fractional galaxies in each bin ; and ( 3 ) a non - gaussian error as a function of absolute magnitude , due to the asymmetric uncertainty in the photometric redshift determination of each galaxy .",
    "the second source of error , because of our large galaxy sample size , is much smaller than the third source of error .",
    "we computed the error from that third source with a standard bootstrap technique , using 150 random samplings ( with duplication allowed ) of the observed dataset to determine the 68% confidence intervals for @xmath129 in each magnitude bin .",
    "each lf segment was fit to a power - law slope using weighted least squares .",
    "to avoid possible biasing of the faint - end slope by galaxies near @xmath113 , which as we mentioned above is not well determined by our technique , we only use data fainter than @xmath130 in our fits . in one case",
    ", we make a more restrictive magnitude cutoff : the lowest redshift bin in the starburst spectral type . there , the measured lf drops discontinuously at @xmath131 .",
    "we suspect this has occurred because @xmath113 may be quite faint for this galaxy type and redshift bin , thus distorting our measurement of the lf brightward of that point .",
    "so to ensure that the @xmath10 fit to that lf is not correspondingly distorted , we use only data fainter than @xmath132 for that particular fit . in both figures [ lfs_1 ] and [ lfs_abcd ] ,",
    "the measured lf data points are plotted as symbols , and the best - fit @xmath10 values are plotted as dotted lines .",
    "the faint - end slope fits are summarized in table 2 .",
    "because of the combined large area and depth of the cosmos survey , the luminosity functions presented in this work provide a glimpse of @xmath10 across a substantial range of redshift in a single , consistent dataset .",
    "with this view , our results show that for all spectral types combined , @xmath133 for the local ( @xmath97 ) universe . as the redshift increases",
    ", @xmath10 flattens out somewhat , and is @xmath134 in our highest redshift bin ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "our local lf is consistent with results from the two largest local galaxy surveys to date , which have comparable ( @xmath135 galaxies ) sample sizes to our study here .",
    "the 2dfgrs survey found that , for the @xmath136 band galaxy luminosity function , @xmath137 ( @xcite ) and @xmath138 for the redshift range @xmath139 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sdss has @xmath140 for a slightly redshifted @xmath141-band galaxy lf for galaxies brighter than @xmath142 ( @xcite ) , and @xmath143 at fainter magnitudes ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite has further shown that , with the appropriate conversion of the 2dfgrs @xmath136 data , it and the sdss @xmath144-band lfs have consistent low - luminosity slopes . at higher redshift ,",
    "our results are consistent with @xcite , who independently derived @xmath145 in the range @xmath146 for a portion of the cosmos survey area .",
    "our results are also consistent with results from other surveys given in the literature - for example , with the v - band lf derived from the vvds ( @xcite ) , where @xmath147 in the range @xmath146 .    the formal errors in our @xmath10 measurements are higher than those of most of these other studies ; this is probably mainly because of the systematic slope uncertainties that we attempt to account for with our simulations .",
    "our overall agreement , however , appears to confirm that we have properly accounted for the errors that result from representing galaxies as probability - smoothed luminosity distributions .",
    "the luminosity functions in the four galaxy spectral type bins we used - sed templates of early - type , sbc , scd+irr , and low - extinction starbursts - follow the well - known pattern of steeper @xmath10 for bluer galaxies . in our low - redshift bin , @xmath10 increases from @xmath148 in early - types to @xmath149 in starbursts ; the trend continues with increasing redshift , showing a similar steepening of @xmath10 , from @xmath150 to @xmath151 .    as with the full galaxy sample ,",
    "these type - specific results are consistent with the findings of previous work in the literature .",
    "of course , due to differing galaxy selection criteria and redshift binning , exact comparisons are not always possible . generally speaking , however , for local galaxies , our red / early - type and intermediate spiral galaxy lfs are consistent with sdss and 2dfgrs results ; and previous samples of @xmath152 galaxy populations",
    "have also shown very steep @xmath10 for the bluest and most irregular galaxies : @xmath153 for the cfa redshift survey ( @xcite ) , @xmath154 for the las campanas redshift survey ( @xcite ) , @xmath155 for the ssrs2 ( @xcite ) , and @xmath156 from the deep multicolor survey ( @xcite ) and sdss ( @xcite ) . at higher redshifts ,",
    "comparisons with combo-17 ( @xcite ) , vvds ( @xcite ) , and with the cosmos survey itself ( @xcite ) show broad consistency across the various galaxy type and redshift intervals .      in the context of the broad consistency of our results with those in the literature ,",
    "perhaps the most striking result in this work is the clear trend , with every galaxy spectral type , of a flattening of the faint - end slope with increasing redshift . from our lowest redshift bin to our highest - i.e. , from @xmath157 to @xmath158 - @xmath159 and @xmath160",
    "respectively for early - types , sbc , scd+irr , and low - extinction starbursts .    on the surface , this trend may not appear to be consistent with previous work .",
    "much of the work to derive the evolution of galaxy lf parameters @xmath113 and @xmath161 as a function of redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in fact , depends upon the assumption that @xmath10 does not evolve with redshift , or at most weakly evolves to @xmath162 .",
    "we have focused here on the measurement of @xmath10 rather than those other parameters ; that , and the fact that all of our measurements have come from a single dataset , plus the fact that each individual determination of @xmath10 is consistent with previous work , supports the likelihood that this observed flattening trend is real .",
    "the question is , do these changing slopes represent true evolution in @xmath10 , or do they reflect our ability to detect different galaxy populations as a function of redshift ?",
    "the latter possibility can be discussed in the context of , among others , @xcite and @xcite , who suggest that the faint end of the field galaxy lf is comprised of a composite population of dwarf and non - dwarf galaxies , each with its own functional form .",
    "this would mean that a single power law is not quite sufficient to describe the lf faint end accurately .",
    "@xcite further suggests , through detailed examination of the faint galaxy population in the sdss , that a large fraction of these dwarf galaxies may have very low surface brightness , and are thus not included in most faint end lf measurements .",
    "our dependence on photometric redshifts places an important caveat on the interpretation of our data : by using `` fuzzy '' galaxies , any second - order deviations from a power law at the faint end of the lf may well have been smoothed out , and are thus not recoverable from our lf measurements .",
    "so if a deviation from a single faint - end power law does occur at very low luminosities , we can not address that issue with this work .",
    "due to the substantial depth of the cosmos survey imaging , it is likely that we have successfully measured a larger fraction of low surface brightness dwarf galaxies than wider - area , shallower surveys such as sdss or 2dfgrs .",
    "the steepness of our low - redshift lfs may reflect this .",
    "even the cosmos survey depth , however , does not allow us to measure @xmath10 fainter than @xmath163 at @xmath164 , so we can not say if the flattening of @xmath10 in our higher redshift bins is due to the non - detection of these dwarfs .",
    "there may be some circumstantial evidence , however , to support that picture .",
    "for example , @xcite measured for the goods survey @xmath165 for the rest - frame b - band from @xmath166 , which is somewhat steeper than most lf measurements in this range .",
    "however , the goods survey is very deep ; so in this broad redshift bin , a large detected fraction of faint , low surface brightness dwarfs near @xmath167 could have driven @xmath10 to a steeper value for the full range .",
    "as the spectroscopic portion of the cosmos survey ( @xcite ) is completed , we will be able to address this question in more detail , as we deconvolve the faint end of the galaxy lf as a multivariate function of color , morphology , luminosity , and redshift .",
    "using the cosmos multiband photometry and photometric redshift catalog , we have constructed faint - end rest - frame v - band luminosity functions for the galaxy population at @xmath99 in the cosmos survey volume . since we are using photometric redshifts , we have computed these lfs by treating galaxies as weighted probability - smoothed luminosity distributions , and using a modified @xmath117 method .",
    "a total of 49,161 galaxies have photometric redshifts that fall in this redshift range ; within and outside this range , a total of 80,820 galaxies contribute to the derived lfs .",
    "extensive monte carlo simulations were used to characterize and account for the systematic and random errors of this technique .",
    "for all galaxy spectral types , the lf slope ranges from @xmath1 to @xmath2 from the lowest redshift bin to the highest . in the lowest redshift bin ( @xmath3 ) ,",
    "where the magnitude limit is @xmath4 , the slope ranges from @xmath168 for galaxies with early - type spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , to @xmath169 for galaxies with low - extinction starburst seds . in each galaxy",
    "sed category ( early - type , sbc , scd+irr , and starburst ) , the faint - end slopes grow shallower with increasing redshift ; in the highest redshift bin ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath170 and @xmath151 for early - types and starbursts respectively .    all of our derived type - specific lfs , across our redshift ranges , are broadly consistent with the findings of previous authors .",
    "our results thus show a flattening trend for @xmath10 with increasing redshift for each spectral type .",
    "it is unclear , however , if this is evidence of @xmath10 evolution in the galaxy lf , or of preferential selection of dwarf galaxies in the local universe .",
    "the steepness of @xmath10 at lower redshift could be qualitatively explained , for example , by large numbers of faint dwarfs , perhaps of low surface brightness , which are not detected at higher redshifts .",
    "we will address this question in a future paper , as the full set of cosmos data - in particular , spectroscopic redshifts - are obtained .",
