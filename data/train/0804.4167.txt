    "entanglement , i.e. , quantum nonlocal correlations between physical systems , is not only a basic feature of quantum behavior @xcite , but also an important resource for quantum computation and quantum information @xcite .",
    "decoherence , i.e. , loss of coherence of states of quantum systems due to the interaction with the environment , is one of the major stumbling blocks for quantum computation @xcite .",
    "therefore recently there has been a surge of interest in effects of decoherence on entanglement @xcite .",
    "one of the most striking manifestations of the nonclassical nature of entanglement is violation of the bell inequality ( bi ) @xcite .",
    "effects of decoherence on the bi violation have attracted a significant interest recently @xcite .",
    "decoherence transforms a pure entangled state into a mixed state , decreasing thus entanglement and the bell inequality violation . while any pure ( completely coherent ) entangled state can be used for violation of the bi @xcite , there are mixed ( partially incoherent ) entangled states which can not violate the bi @xcite .",
    "in fact , the ratio of the volume of the entangled states violating the bi to the volume of the entangled states obeying the bi is small . in particular , in the hilbert - schmidt metric this ratio equals @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that observation of the bell inequality violation is a more difficult task than observation of entanglement .",
    "indeed , in the presence of decoherence the duration of the bell - inequality violation is generally significantly shorter than the entanglement survival time @xcite .    until now most experiments on the bi violation",
    "have been performed with photons @xcite . however , recently there has been an increasing interest in testing the bi for various material systems , where decoherence is usually an important factor . in particular , experiments with ions in traps",
    "@xcite , an atom - photon system @xcite , and single neutrons @xcite were performed .",
    "there are also various theoretical proposals related to the bi violation in solid - state systems @xcite .",
    "experiments on testing the bi in superconducting josephson phase qubits @xcite are currently underway @xcite .    optimal experimental conditions for observation of the bi violation in superconducting phase qubits were considered in ref . .",
    "both the ideal case and effects of various nonidealities , such as measurement errors and crosstalk @xcite , were analyzed in detail , while decoherence was discussed briefly . in the recent paper @xcite the relation between entanglement and the bi violation",
    "was considered . in particular ,",
    "the survival times of entanglement and the bi violation in the presence of local decoherence were studied , in the frame of a decoherence model more general than in previous publications @xcite , the focus being on the class of `` odd '' two - qubit states relevant for experiments with superconducting phase qubits @xcite .",
    "note , however , that optimal detector configurations providing the maximal bi violation were not discussed previously , except for the case of pure dephasing @xcite ( see also brief remarks in refs . and ) .",
    "the knowledge of all optimal configurations is important for planning experiments , since some detector configurations can be easier to realize than others @xcite .    in the present paper , we provide a comprehensive discussion of effects of local decoherence on the bi violation .",
    "we obtain both optimal states and all detector configurations which yield the maximal bi violation .",
    "our decoherence model includes energy relaxation at the zero temperature ( known also as spontaneous decay or amplitude damping ) and dephasing ( phase damping ) .",
    "we analyze analytically and numerically the general case and a number of important special cases .",
    "in particular , we study the experimentally relevant classes of the `` even '' and  odd  states",

    "[ ivc2 ] , which provides @xmath51 , the optimal state , and the optimal detector configurations .",
    "( b ) a simpler approach is to consider only the optimal even state [ eqs . and ] , which provides rather accurate , if not exact , result , as discussed above .",
    "( c ) the analytical formula and for the optimal odd state can be used , if , e.g. , in the experiment the odd state is realized more conveniently than other entangled states , as is the case for experiments with superconducting phase qubits .",
    "( d ) an even simpler approach is to use the bell state @xmath78 or @xmath79 [ see eqs . and ] . in the approaches ( c ) and ( d ) the bi violation is obtained under more restrictive conditions than in ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "however , if one requires a significant degree of the bi violation , say , @xmath135 ( which may be needed in the presence of other experimental errors ) , there is practically no advantages for one approach over the others ( see figs .",
    "[ f4 ] and [ f5 ] ) .",
    "in the previous sections we assumed that measurements are ideal . here we take into account the possibility that measurements of the qubits are performed with local ( independent ) errors .",
    "effects of local errors were studied elsewhere @xcite . in this section",
    "we discuss combined effects of local errors and local decoherence .",
    "the present case is rather involved , since it includes complications due to both decoherence and errors .",
    "here we discuss only the general approach to the problem , whereas a detailed analysis is out of the scope of the present paper ( see also ref . ) .      in the frame of the error model considered in ref . , the measured probabilities are written in the form p_ij^m=_m , n=0 ^ 1f^a_imf^b_jnp_mn = tr(q_i^a q_j^b ) , where @xmath147 are the povm operators describing the measurement @xcite [ cf .",
    "and @xmath148 is the probability to find qubit @xmath149 in state @xmath150 when it is actually in state @xmath151 .",
    "the fidelity matrix @xmath152 obeys @xmath153 and hence has two independent parameters , e.g. , @xmath154 and @xmath155 , the measurement fidelities for the states @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",

    ".      in the presence of decoherence and errors we perform the substitution in eq . .",
    "it is useful to recast the resulting expression as s = tr(_0 ) where the bell operator modified by errors and decoherence is = ( l_a^*_b^*)()=-+ +. here @xmath163 , @xmath164 , etc . , where the povm operators @xmath165 are given by @xmath166 or [ cf .",

    "consider properties of @xmath37 which can be helpful in calculations .",
    "one of the peculiarities present in the case with errors is that the maximal and minimal values of @xmath37 for a given state are generally not equal by the magnitude @xcite , @xmath170 .",
    "note , however , the relations which follow from eqs . , , and , & & s -s - , - , f_0^af_1^a ; [ trsf - a ] + & & s -s - , - , f_0^bf_1^b .",
    "moreover , one has @xmath171 if the two measurement fidelities are equal , at least , for one qubit : f_0^a = f_1^a   f_0^b = f_1^b .",
    "the relations and were obtained previously @xcite for the case without decoherence .    in the special case of equal measurement fidelities for each qubit ,",
    "f_0^a = f_1^a = f_a ,  f_0^b = f_1^b = f_b , eq .",
    "yields @xmath172 and hence s=(2f_a-1)(2f_b-1)s_d , where @xmath173 is the value of @xmath37 obtained in the presence of decoherence but in the absence of measurement errors .",
    "this case can be analyzed , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ iv ] .",
    "there is no analytical solution in the presence of errors @xcite .",
    "moreover , the present case involves an eight - dimensional parameter space ( there are two decoherence parameters and two measurement fidelities for each qubit ) , which additionally complicates the analysis .",
    "similarly to sec . [ iv ] , the modified bell operator @xmath174 can be used for numerical calculations , since for given decoherence and error parameters the maximum ( minimum ) value of @xmath37 equals the maximum ( minimum ) of the greatest ( smallest ) eigenvalue of @xmath174 over the detector directions , the optimal state being given by the corresponding eigenvector .",
    "now , as in sec .",
    "[ iv ] , @xmath37 is invariant only to rotations of the qubits and detectors around the @xmath57 axis , which allows one to reduce the number of the fitting parameters from eight to six by setting , say , @xmath175 .",
    "this number can not be further reduced , since , in contrast to sec .",
    "[ iv ] , in the presence of errors the set of optimal configurations for a given state is not continuous @xcite , and hence it is impossible to choose one of the optimal measurement axes at will .",
    "this computation procedure is relatively slow .",
    "it produces generally different optimal states for different values of the parameters .",
    "an approach which is faster and more relevant for most experiments is to consider the bi violation for a specific initial state @xmath176 , e.g. , the odd or even state [ eqs . and ] . in this case",
    "an expression for @xmath37 resulting from eq .",
    "is varied over the detector directions and perhaps the state parameters [ e.g. , @xmath90 in eqs . and ] .",
    "note that in the cases of the odd and even states the number of the detector parameters can be reduced from eight to seven .",
    "indeed , since the odd ( even ) state is invariant under a rotation of qubits @xmath1 and @xmath2 around the @xmath57 axis by an arbitrary angle @xmath110 ( @xmath110 and @xmath177 , respectively ) , one can set , e.g. , @xmath178 , in view of the @xmath57-rotation symmetry for @xmath37 . for a detailed analysis of the case of the odd state , eq .",

    "in the present paper we have considered conditions for maximal violations of the bell inequality in the presence of decoherence .",
    "in addition , combined effects of decoherence and local measurement errors have been discussed .",
    "since decoherence transforms a pure entangled state into a mixed state , we have begun the consideration from the study of optimal conditions for the violation of the bi for a general ( pure or mixed ) state .",
    "we have obtained all detector configurations providing the maximal value of the parameter @xmath37 in eq . for an arbitrary state .",
    "we have shown that generally the set of all optimal configurations for a given state is characterized by one continuous and one discrete parameters , whereas in special cases it can be characterized by two or three continuous parameters .",
    "we have obtained also the symmetry relation for the optimal detector orientations , eq . or , which follows from the invariance of @xmath37 with respect to the qubit swap .",
    "further , we have considered effects of local decoherence on the bi violation .",
    "the decoherence model used includes energy relaxation at the zero temperature and arbitrary dephasing .",
    "we have employed the decoherence superoperator in the operator - sum form with the kraus operators which generalize the previously known ones .",
    "we have expressed @xmath37 as the average over the initial state of the bell operator modified by decoherence .",
    "this operator has been used for numerical calculations in order to obtain the maximal bi violation for any values of the decoherence parameters .",
    "we have also developed a faster numerical approach , which is based on an analytical solution for a certain class of states .",
    "we have studied the bi violation maximized over the observation directions and over all states or a class of states and obtained all corresponding optimal detector configurations .",
    "we have obtained simple analytical solutions for the odd and even states [ eqs . and or , more generally , and ] , which are often used in experiments on the bi violation . in particular , the odd state is relevant for experiments with superconducting phase qubits .",
    "whereas in the absence of decoherence the optimal detector configurations for the odd and even states are vertical ( sec .",
    "[ iiig3 ] ) , in the presence of decoherence the optimal configurations are either vertical or horizontal .",
    "we have discussed both the general case of arbitrary decoherence parameters and a number of important special cases . in particular , we have discovered that the even state is optimal in most cases .",
    "our analysis have been illustrated by numerical calculations .",
    "we have considered the combined effects of local errors and decoherence . in this case",
    "the maximal bell violation depends on eight parameters .",
    "we have derived the bell operator modified by decoherence and errors and have used it to discuss symmetry properties of @xmath37 and special cases .",
    "we have also outlined the numerical approaches in this case .",
