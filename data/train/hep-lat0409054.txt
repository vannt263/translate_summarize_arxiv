    "in the theory of critical phenomena , continuous phase transitions can be classified into universality classes determined only by a few properties characterizing the system , such as the space dimensionality , the range of interaction , the number of components of the order parameter , the symmetry and the symmetry - breaking pattern @xcite .",
    "renormalization - group theory predicts that critical exponents , universal amplitude ratios and scaling functions are the same for all systems belonging to a given universality class .",
    "the @xmath0 universality classes are among the most important ones .",
    "they are characterized by an @xmath10-component order parameter and a symmetry group @xmath0 which is spontaneously broken to a subgroup @xmath13 in the low - temperature phase . for a recent review on this subject ,",

    "we study the @xmath0 three - dimensional universality class , with @xmath14 .",
    "the three - dimensional @xmath15 model is relevant for the finite - temperature behavior of qcd with two light - quark flavors @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16-@xmath17 @xmath18 model is relevant for the so - called @xmath7 theory of high-@xmath8 superconductivity @xcite . according to universality arguments",
    ", the @xmath9 model should describe the chiral phase transition in two - color qcd with two flavors @xcite .",
    "the equation of state is a relation between the magnetization @xmath19 , the reduced temperature and the external magnetic field @xmath20 . near the critical point",

    "we introduce two approximation schemes : @xmath56    for @xmath57 the two schemes are the same . in both cases , the coefficients @xmath58 and",
    "@xmath50 are determined by imposing that the equation of state , for @xmath34 or , equivalently , @xmath46 , reproduces the expansion ( [ expf ] ) .",

    "we use field - theoretical estimates of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , obtained by analyzing the perturbative series @xcite . for the critical exponents we use the monte carlo estimates of @xcite for @xmath63 and field - theoretical estimates @xcite for the other models .",
