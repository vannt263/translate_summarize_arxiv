    "it is widely believed that s0s were initially spirals which lost their interstellar medium ( ism hereafter ) during collisions @xcite by `` harassment '' @xcite or by `` ram - pressure '' .",
    "simulations show that such events could occur both in clusters @xcite and in groups ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    from the kinematical point of view , genuine s0s are quite distinct from giant ellipticals since they are fast rotating , like late - type galaxies . at the same time , if s0s were originally spirals , they should have formed their mass over a significant fraction of the hubble time , following a star formation history more similar to that of late - type galaxies rather than that of giant elliptical galaxies . in this context",

    "the case of the ring s0 companion ngc 5636 is quite different : the observed sed shows a fuv excess with respect to the best - fit model assuming foreground extinction of 0.04 indicating that a simply passive sfh is inappropriate .",
    "ages and stellar masses of the outer ring structures were estimated using fuv and nuv measurements because only upper limits can be derived from the sdss images .",

    "only the outer ring in ngc  2962 is visible in uv _ galex _ images . the structure of the ring and the outer features detected in ngc  2974 are reminiscent of the ngc 2962 case , which is seen more face - on .",

    "shell structures suggest the occurrence of an accretion phenomenon .    according to different statistical estimations ,",
    "the outer rings are observed in a significant fraction , up to 20@xmath030% , of spiral and lenticular galaxies and are closely associated with the non - axisymmetric structures like bars , ovals or triaxial bulges .",
    "distinct ring structures are often found in the same galaxy @xcite . in terms of the theory , the empirical subdivision of the rings into nuclear",
    ", outer and inner corresponds to the inner , outer lindblads and ultra - harmonic dynamical resonances between the epicyclic oscillations in the stellar component and rotation of the bar ( see the kinematic review of * ? ? ?",
    "the literature reports cases of rings without bar which are explained by weakly triaxial distortions , or by tidal actions from a gravitationally bounded companion , since the non - axisymmetric gravitational perturbations in these cases are similar to those from a bar @xcite .",
    "although ngc  2974 may have suffered an accretion event , we suggest that rings in our barred s0s sample are an effect of the secular ( inner ) evolution ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the tumbling bar redistributes gas angular momentum , and the gas accumulates at the lindblad s resonances ( see a review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where the star formation may take place .",
    "notice that in ngc  1533 the hi is located outside the galaxy ring : the masses of the outer rings do not require a large gas supply , and are consistent with these strcutures having formed from mass loss by the older population of stars @xcite .",
