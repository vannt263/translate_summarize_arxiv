    "striped phases are an important issue in the discussion on physical properties of the high - t@xmath1 materials @xcite .",
    "incommensurate magnetic peaks displaced from the antiferromagnetic wave - vector along @xmath2 and @xmath3 have been observed by inelastic neutron scattering in both la@xmath4sr@xmath5cuo@xmath6 @xcite and yba@xmath7cu@xmath8o@xmath9 ( ybco ) @xcite , whereas in the bi@xmath7sr@xmath7cacu@xmath7o@xmath10 material the incommensurate magnetic peak position has not yet been resolved @xcite .",
    "however , incommensurate magnetic scattering may result from either some kind of spiral phase ( involving a modulation of the transversal spin components only ) or from longitudinal spin fluctuations where in this case a strong coupling to the charge is expected .",
    "evidence for cooperative charge- and spin scattering is based on the observation of domain walls in la@xmath11nd@xmath12sr@xmath13cuo@xmath14 @xcite where the low temperature tetragonal lattice structure and the filling close to @xmath15 are suited to pin the density fluctuations , giving rise to a static cdw phase as revealed by commensurate ionic shifts observed in neutron scattering . from the temperature dependence of the charge- and spin - order peaks",
    "one can further conclude that the stripe order is driven by the charge rather than by the spins .",
    "additional support for charge induced stripe correlations is provided by recent neutron scattering studies of the phonon dispersion in ybco @xcite .",
    "these measurements show a large broadening in the spectrum at wave vectors which are twice the magnetic incommensurability",
    ". moreover , the broadening in the phonon spectrum occurs at higher temperatures as the incommensurable magnetic peaks indicating again that charge fluctuations are the ` driving force ' behind incommensurable magnetic scattering    the formation of stripe correlations in these compounds can be well understood within the concept of frustrated phase separation @xcite where a phase separation instability is prevented by long - range coulomb interactions @xcite . as a result",
    "the long - wavelength density fluctuations associated with phase separation are suppressed in favor of shorter - wavelength density fluctuations , giving rise either to dynamical slow density modes @xcite or to incommensurate charge density waves ( cdw ) @xcite . concerning the pairing mechanism",
    "the theoretical proposals differ with regard to the role of the stripe correlations on the superconducting pair formation . whereas some theories consider the formation of quasi 1-d ` rivers of charge ' as a necessary environment for the quasiparticles to pair or to enhance t@xmath1 @xcite others take the fluctuations associated with the stripe instability itself as a pairing mechanism @xcite .",
    "the proximity to a stripe instability tuned by doping and temperature allows to interpret many properties of the cuprates as due to a quantum critical point ( qcp ) @xcite located near optimal doping @xcite . within this scenario",
    "the singular scattering induced by the critical fluctuations would be responsible for both the anomalous normal - state properties and the large superconducting critical temperatures .",
    "then the phase diagram of the cuprates is partitioned in the ( nearly ) ordered , the quantum critical , and the quantum disordered regions corresponding to the under- , optimally , and over - doped regions of the phase diagram of the cuprates .",
    "the relevance of the stripe phase and of the stripe fluctuations should find an experimental confirmation ( or a disproof ) in the analysis of the single - particle spectral properties . taking the point of view that incommensurate cdw scattering contributes to determine the electronic properties of the high - t@xmath1 materials",
    "the question arises how the electronic structure around the fermi energy is affected by this scattering and if this can be detected by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , there are several features which seem to be common to all p - type cuprates ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the dispersion displays an extended saddle - point at ( @xmath16 ) ( here and in the following we will consider unitary lattice spacing @xmath17 ) with an energy close to e@xmath18 , which has been observed in bi2212 @xcite as well as in ybacuo @xcite samples .",
    "furthermore , the fermi surface of bi2212 is very strongly nested with a nesting vector of approximately 0.9 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the resulting picture for the fermi surface therefore consists of tube - like structures around the m - points which are connected by more or less straight pieces .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that many of these unusual fermi surface features can be explained by assuming a disordered stripe phase to be present in the high - t@xmath1 copper oxides .",
    "the fact that the charge carriers are exposed to a stripe potential mirrors in the fermi surface through one - dimensional characteristics which predominantly appear around the m - points .    a further fascinating fermi surface feature of the high t@xmath1 superconductors , which has been detected in arpes measurements concerns the pseudogap phenomenon which is observed in optimally and underdoped bismuth compounds below a doping dependent temperature @xmath20 @xcite . in underdoped samples of bi2212 @xcite",
    "there is a qualitative change in the electronic structure with respect to the optimally doped system already above t@xmath0 , with the appearance of so - called leading - edge gaps around the m points . in these k - space regions",
    "there is no indication of a quasiparticle peak , and the spectra are dramatically broadened and shifted to higher binding energies with a maximum at 100 - 200 mev . as a consequence large portions of the fermi surface around these points are not visible whereas along the @xmath21 directions the spectral lineshapes are similar to those of the optimally doped samples .",
    "similar results where obtained in the one - plane material bi2201 @xcite showing that bilayers are not essential to the pseudogap phenomena .",
    "a common explanation for the features described above is based on the existence of pre - formed pairs already above t@xmath0 , since a continuous evolution of the spectra from the normal to the superconducting state @xcite was apparently observed . in particular , a superconducting d - wave gap is in accordance with the symmetry of the pseudogap .",
    "moreover , for materials with @xmath22 the existence of two temperature scales for pairing and phase coherence is a rather natural consequence .",
    "however , this simple scenario is put in jeopardy by various experimental findings .",
    "first of all the rapid increase of @xmath23 by decreasing doping is to be contrasted with the much more moderate increase of the maximum gap at low temperature .",
    "( @xmath23 doubles when @xmath24 goes from 90 k to about 75 k in bi-2212 , whereas in the same doping range , @xmath25 around the m - points changes by thirty per cent at most ) .",
    "this suggests that a substantial temperature dependence of the pairing potential is present in this doping range .",
    "furthermore recent arpes experiments @xcite show that the pseudogap above @xmath24 gradually appears at the m points leaving extended segments of the fermi surface gapless .",
    "these segments continuously shrink to a point - like node only below the superconducting critical teperature @xmath24 .",
    "needless to say that these behaviors do not correspond neither to the usual bcs gap opening process nor to the phase locking of uniform preformed pairs .",
    "instead it might find an interpretation along the line of coexisting pairs and fermionic quasiparticles @xcite .    in front of this unsettled issue",
    ", one may ask whether the rich and unexplained behavior of the pseudogap phenomena could result from an electron - hole pair scattering above t@xmath0 rather than from pair correlations alone .",
    "this line of argumentation has been followed in several analyses based on the scattering between fermions and collective spin excitations @xcite .",
    "a quite similar outcome would instead arise from the quasiparticles being scattered by incommensurate charge fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the fact that a substantial part of the spectral features of the optimally and underdoped cuprates can be explained in terms of particle - hole scattering is also supported by recent experiments @xcite measuring the fermi surface by sequential angle - scanning photoemission .",
    "these results clearly show the missing segments of the fermi surface around the m - points with a shape , which can be interpreted in terms of scattering of the quasiparticles with quasicritical mixed spin and charge fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the idea that the pseudogap could ( not only ) arise from pairing in the particle - particle channel , but also from different scattering mechanims ( like cdw fluctuations ) finds an additional support in the recent analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the experimental results on the low - temperature penetration depth suggest that the doping behavior of the low - temperature gap near the nodes in the ( 1,1 ) direction is similar to what expected from standard d - wave bcs theory with the gap scaling with @xmath24 .",
    "this is in contrast with the behavior of the pseudogap measured at the k - points around @xmath26 and @xmath27 in arpes experiments below @xmath23 , which increases with decreasing @xmath24 .",
    "this suggests the possibility that at high temperature ( @xmath28 ) the gap is due to cdw fluctuations scattering in the particle - hole channel . in this regard",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the incommensurate cdw scattering resulting from the competition between phase separation and long range repulsive coulomb forces , occurs near some scattering vector @xmath29 not related to the fermi vector k@xmath30 .",
    "it was also shown within a standard large - n approach @xcite that the effective scattering amplitude close to @xmath29 in the particle - hole channel is strongly attractive and similarly structured in momentum space in the particle - particle channel also , thus resulting in substantial pairing in the d - wave channel .",
    "within this scenario , the strong momentum - dependent effective interaction is responsible both for ( preformed ) pairing and for pseudogap formation due to dynamical charge modulation .",
    "therefore searching for spectral features arising from scattering mechanisms acting in the particle - hole channel is not necessarily in contrast with the interpretation of other features in terms of pairing in the particle - particle channel .    in the present paper",
    "we are interested in the question if incommensurate cdw scattering , resulting from the competition between phase separation and long range repulsive coulomb forces , can account for some of the above anomalous features observed in photoemission experiments .",
    "this problem was partly tackled in ref.@xcite within a perturbative treatment of quasicritical spin and charge fluctuations .",
    "this perturbative approach is unfortunately not feasible in the underdoped region , deep inside the stripe phase .",
    "therefore we perform here a mean - field analysis , which should capture the non - perturbative character of well - formed stripes . of course , the dynamical character of the stripe fluctuations will be missed .",
    "nevertheless , at short distances and time as those probed in photoemission experiments , this description should be appropriate .",
    "we emphasize once again that the complexity of the physics of the cuprates , particularly of the underdoped ones , involves spin and cooper as well as charge density fluctuations .",
    "our aim is therefore _ not _ to account for all the spectral properties of these materials , which likely arise from the interplay of all these mechanisms .",
    "we rather conservatively aim to point out that some of the prominent ( and puzzling ) features of the cuprates could find a natural interpretation by assuming charge quasi - ordering .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "in section ii the model and the general formalism are presented .",
    "section iii contains the physical results for the fermi surface and the spectral densities , which are discussed and summarized in the conclusive section iv .",
    "starting point is the hubbard - holstein model with an additional in - plane long - range coulomb interaction    @xmath31    2 where @xmath32 destroys ( creates ) an electron with spin @xmath33 at site i and @xmath34 destroys ( creates ) a local holstein - type phonon at site i. the summation over nearest- and next - nearest neighbour sites is indicated by @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "@xmath37 is the local electron density and its fourier transform is given by @xmath38 .",
    "the last term in eq.([huhol ] ) describes the coulomb interaction between electrons on a two - dimensional , square lattice ( lattice constant @xmath39 in x- and y - direction ) , which is considered as a plane embedded in the 3-dimensional lattice ( plane distance @xmath40 in the z - direction ) .",
    "the dielectric constants in the plane and perpendicular to it are given by @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the coulombic coupling constant is @xmath43 . on the z=0 plane the momentum dependence of the coulomb potential",
    "is found to be @xmath44 . as usual",
    ", the sum in the coulombic potential does not include the zero - momentum component , since we are supposing that the diverging @xmath45 interaction between electrons is canceled by the contribution of a uniform positively charged ionic background .",
    "since we are interested in the limit of strong local repulsion , we take the limit @xmath46 , which gives rise to the local constraint of zero double occupancy @xmath47 . to implement this constraint",
    "we use a standard slave - boson technique @xcite by performing the usual substitution @xmath48 , @xmath49 and implement the local constraint by a local lagrange multiplier @xmath50 .",
    "the model can first be solved in the mean field approximation by setting the @xmath51 and @xmath50 bosons to their constant self - consistent values @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively . at this stage",
    "the phonons and the coulombic interaction decouple from the fermionic quasiparticles for an homogeneous mean - field solution .",
    "the system then results in free quasiparticles with a shifted chemical potential @xmath54 and a dispersion @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 corresponds to the concentration of doped holes .",
    "the mean - field value for @xmath58 is determined by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the fermi function .",
    "the effective interaction leading to scattering between quasiparticles arises from the exchange of the bosonic fields beyond the mean - field approximation .",

    "the hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) is the starting point of all further investigations .",
    "its interaction consists of a part , @xmath75 , increasing with @xmath76 , which describes the residual scattering of the quasiparticles through the slave - bosons exchange .",
    "the superposition of the long - range coulombic part causes the interaction to exhibit a minimum as a function of @xmath77 .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling @xmath78 rigidly shifts the potential to lower values .",
    "this will induce an instability in the density - density response function at a critical value of @xmath79 when @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the particle - hole fermionic bubble .",
    "this instability marks therefore a transition to an incommensurate cdw with scattering vector @xmath82 @xcite .    to proceed",
    "we will approximate the effective model eq .",
    "( [ h0 ] ) by a hartree factorization and assume that the symmetry of the system is broken with respect to a given vector @xmath82 and its multiples .",
    "notice that retardation effects arising from the frequency dependence of the total scattering amplitude have been neglected at this level .",
    "this mean - field treatment of eq.[h0 ] finds some justification in investigating static or low - energy properties of the quasiparticles close to the fermi level , whereas this approximation is crude in the analysis of dynamical properties at frequencies , which are comparable with the typical energies of the exchanged boson .    in order to reproduce the unperturbed fermi surface ( i.e. of the overdoped system ) of the bi2212 compounds at optimal doping we take the hopping parameter @xmath83 to be @xmath84 , which leads to an open fermi surface centered around @xmath85 .",
    "it turns out that within a linear response approach as in ref .",
    ", for this kind of bandstructure the cdw instability occurs first in the ( 1,0 ) or ( and ) ( 0,1 ) directions .",
    "in fact , a negative value of @xmath83 enhances the density of states around the m - points , which mirrors in an enhancement of the fermionic bubble @xmath81 in the ( 1,0 ) and ( 0,1 ) directions .",
    "thus in a rpa - like treatment the divergence of the density - density response function preferably takes place for @xmath86 in the @xmath87 or in the @xmath88 directions . within a linear - response analysis ,",
    "the instability is forced to occur at a given wavevector and the above arguments are in favor of the instability taking place with a modulation alternatively in the @xmath89 or @xmath90 direction described by the order parameter @xmath91 . however , a non - linear instability ( as the one here described by a standard set of hartree mean - field equations ) can also occur simultaneously along both directions leading to a two - dimensional eggbox type modulation of the charge . in this case , the density expectation value is given by @xmath92 .",
    "although we are now dealing with an effective one - particle hamiltonian , it is clear that the system can not be diagonalized for general incommensurate @xmath82 vectors .",
    "we therefore represent @xmath82 as @xmath93 which allows us to simulate the incommensurability by increasing the values for both @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively . once the the scattering term in eq .",
    "[ h0 ] is decoupled _  la _ hartree , for each k - point in the reduced bz , the bare bloch functions @xmath96 with k - vector @xmath97 , are mixed by the interaction .",
    "@xmath98 depends on @xmath29 via the condition @xmath99 . for each k - point",
    ", the hamiltonian can be put in a matrix form , which can be diagonalized thus finding the linear transformation from the bare bloch states @xmath100 to the new eigenstates @xmath101 .",
    "the system can be diagonalized numerically and the cdw order parameters @xmath102 are determined self consistently .",
    "once self - consistency is reached , the eigenvalues @xmath103 give the band structure of the system .    the spectral function in the full bz",
    "then consists of a ensemble of weighted delta - functions and is given by @xmath104    it should be noticed that this approach mantains its full validity as long as the initial constraint of no double occupancy is satisfied .",
    "therefore we will restrict in the following to the cases where the cdw order parameter is small enough that the local density never exceeds one , @xmath105 .",
    "in this section we will discuss the bandstructure , fermi surface and photoemission spectra resulting from either 1-d or eggbox type cdw scattering . for simplicity , in the following a planar cell of unitary length ( @xmath17 ) will be used . since in the sytems with two cuo@xmath7 layers per unit cell ( as in bi2212 ) different stripe orientations in different planes or",
    "also in different regions of the same plane may be realized , we consider also the case of superimposed ( 10)- and ( 01)-stripes . on the other hand the eggbox - solution , where the symmetry is broken in the @xmath89 and @xmath90 directions at the same time , can be regarded as a model for 1-d stripes fastly fluctuating between the ( 10)- and ( 01)-direction , while maintaining a fixed @xmath106 .",

    "moving further towards @xmath145 one meets the main fermi surface with highest intensity around @xmath147 , and then weak ( less than @xmath148 of intensity ) features at @xmath149 .",
    "it is not unconceivable that these multiple crossings of the ( shadow ) fermi surface(s ) have been observed , although the common interpretation refers to magnetic scattering @xcite .",
    "this finding suggests that , together with the magnetic scattering , charge scattering could cooperate to bring spectral weight at the fermi surface in a `` pocket - like '' shape @xcite .",

    "the effect of the 2-d scattering becomes more transparent in the bandstructure cuts plotted in fig .",
    "scanning along the diagonal direction gives a strong splitting of states around the @xmath130 point similar to our previous findings for 1-d scattering .",
    "moving further towards the x - point most of these states rapidly lose in intensity and at the fs crossing there is only one main band left together with two shadow bands with low intensity in accordance with the fs shown in fig . 6 .",

    "the fermi function has been added as a background .",

    "dashed lines : homogeneous system .",
    "the broadening of the @xmath133-functions is 25mev .",
    "the band structure along @xmath129 is plotted in fig . 7b .",
    "also in this case we observe that at the m - point the cdw scattering has induced various bands with intermediate and low intensity . at the former fs crossing ( indicated by the arrow )",
    "now a gap occurs which is of the order of the cdw order parameter @xmath152 .",
    "although the main band ( full circles ) bends upwards when approaching the fermi level there is a fs crossing by the shadow band with intermediate intensity .",
    "this crossing occurs at a slightly larger k@xmath153 value than in the unperturbed system which mirrors in fig .",
    "6 as a broadening of the tube structure around the m - points .    in fig .",
    "8 we show the energy distribution curves along the @xmath21 and @xmath129 directions .",
    "scanning along the diagonal one clearly observes the multiple peak structure for the deeply bound states in fig .",
    "however , approaching the fs crossing , due to the rapid loss of intensity in the scattered bands , there appears a evolution into a single peak structure which crosses the fermi level at @xmath154 . in the right panel of fig .",
    "8a we plot a comparison of the cdw spectra with the peak evolution of the homogeneous system for selected k - points . from this plot",
    "it becomes clear that along the diagonal direction the peak structure for the symmetry broken system approaches the unperturbed form as one approaches e@xmath18 . on the other hand , scanning along the m@xmath155x direction , the peak structure basically is built up by the two bands with intermediate intensity below e@xmath30 which are shown in fig . 7b .",
    "therefore one observes a double peak structure at the m - point where the lower peak decreases in intensity upon approaching the fermi level .",
    "due to the induced cdw - gap at the fs crossing of the homogeneous system @xmath156 ) there is a shift of the spectra to lower energy as can be seen from the right panel of fig ( 8b ) .",
    "it is also quite interesting to see how the cdw - gap occurring at k@xmath157 evolves when one moves along the fs of the unperturbed system .",
    "the corresponding energy distribution curves are shown in fig .",
    "9 . it turns out that the gap first keeps its value for small angles up to @xmath158 . moving towards the diagonal , the ( pseudo)gap moves at energies below the fermi level , so that at the fermi energy it rapidly decreases and vanishes .",
    "this occurs at @xmath159 .",
    "in addition it is again evident that upon approaching the diagonal direction the cdw peak structure evolves into the unperturbed one .",
    "these findings may correspond to the experimentally observed shrinking of the fs @xcite    we now conclude this analysis of the 2-@xmath40 eggbox cdw scattering by considering the relevant issue of the enhancement of the van hove singularity around the @xmath160 and @xmath161 points .",
    "in particular , as it can be seen in fig . 5d , one finds a generic broadening of the spectra , with dispersionless portions of the spectrum scattered at both higher and lower energies with respect to the unperturbed quasiparticle band .",
    "moreover , two dispersive shadow bands of weak intensity cross the fermi energy nearly halfway between @xmath130 and @xmath160 . all these effects contribute to bring spectral weight at closer distance from the fermi level . once the spectral features observed in the present simplistic mean - field treatment are broadened by the fluctuative character of the cdw and by the many - body effects acting in the real systems , it is not unconceivable that our present findings correspond to an extension of the dispersionless region of the experimental band structure .",

    "the plots are labeled by @xmath162 which is defined in the right panel .",
    "full lines : cdw spectra ; dashed lines : spectra of the unperturbed system .      in the preceeding section we have considered an effective one - particle hamiltonian so that all poles of the resulting spectral function correspond to delta functions .",
    "we now want to extend our results to have some qualitative idea of a more dynamical description of the problem , i.e. the quasiparticle coupling to collective incommensurate cdw fluctuations .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite we start from a phenomenological one - particle hamiltonian @xmath163 where the kinetic part is the same as in the preceeding section and @xmath164 represents an effective eggbox potential given by @xmath165 the amplitude and broadening of the charge modulation is determined by @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 fix the positions of the individual eggboxes. in accordance with the ordered eggbox modulation we choose a mean charge separation of 8a and define @xmath169 where a is the lattice constant and @xmath170 is a random number varying between @xmath171 .",
    "taking @xmath172 one has again an ordered eggbox potential whereas upon increasing p ( p@xmath173 ) long - range charge order is destroyed to an increasing degree .",
    "the charge amplitude @xmath166 is restricted again to values where zero double occupancy at each lattice site is preserved .",
    "the results presented below are averages over five random configurations calculated by diagonalizing a square lattice with dimension 40@xmath17440 in real space .",

    "the qualitative features are the same as in fig .",
    "6 , namely the reduction of intensity around the m - points",
    ". however , the displaced shadow bands are no longer visible now .",
    "instead the fermi surface is smeared in k - space i.e. its boundaries consist of states with low intensity ( @xmath176 ) . around",
    "the m - points these states completely fill up the tube structure .",
    "this could correspond to the findings of sequential angle - scanning photoemission where diffuse features in these regions have been detected @xcite and to the suppression of the fs observed in arpes @xcite .",

    "11 where we have plotted the energy distribution curves along the @xmath21 and @xmath129 directions in comparison with the homogeneous system for two different values of the parameter p which defines the degree of suppression of long - range charge order .",

    "11b than for @xmath179 in fig .",
    "11a . however , scanning along the @xmath21 direction we observe the same feature than for the ordered eggbox modulation , namely the evolution of the spectra into a single peak structure upon approaching the fermi level thus recovering the fs segment of the quasiparticle . on the contrary , at the m - point the quasiparticle peak is now completely suppressed and the spectra are described by a broad feature extending to very low energies .",

    "in this paper we have investigated the possible consequences of incommensurate cdw scattering with regard to the unusual fermi surface and photoemission features in underdoped bismuth cuprates already mentioned above .",
    "our results have been obtained within a scheme , which is subjected to some limitations both at the level of the starting model and of its treatment . in particular ,",
    "only the physics of cdw modulations has been considered , thus neglecting the relevant interplay between charge , spin , and cooper pair fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless it is quite interesting and instructive by itself that our treatment of a pure cdw symmetry broken system still captures some features of the observed spectral properties .",
    "this indicates that charge - ordering can indeed play a role in determining the properties of the cuprates .",
    "the simplified model considered here has been approximately treated in a mean - field scheme aiming to capture features of well - formed locally ordered stripes in the underdoped cuprates . in this scheme",
    "the fermionic quasiparticles do not interact neither among themselves nor with the collective cdw fluctuations . instead the static symmetry breaking due to charge modulation produces bragg scattering giving rise to multiple bands and gap opening . as a result the bands arising from the mean - field description are due to @xmath133-like quasiparticle peaks , which obviously do not individually correspond to the real experimental features .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth noting that the multiple bragg scattering due to incommensuration leads for most @xmath139-points to the appearance of multiple quasiparticle peaks [ the shadow bands , see figs .",
    "( 2),(5),(7 ) ] .",
    "it is quite natural that the broadening arising from the scattering between quasiparticles and the scattering between quasiparticles and collective modes will mix these peaks thus producing the broad features commonly detected in photoemission experiments .",
    "still we believe that our analysis provides the location and relative position of the spectral features .",
    "we considered one - dimensional charge modulations along the ( 1,0 ) and/or ( 0,1 ) as well as a two - dimensional eggbox - like texture .",
    "the one - dimensional solutions could account for some enhancement of the van hove singularities , but do not seem particularly successful in describing the appearance of a pseudogap near the @xmath160 and @xmath140 points . on the other hand",
    "the eggbox case turns out to be particularly appealing .",
    "the main findings are that the 2-d eggbox cdw scattering might account both for a flattening of the band dispersion in the @xmath137 and @xmath180 directions and for the arising of a leading - edge gap around the @xmath181 points leaving finite portions of the fermi surface gapless .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , this latter quite unusual and non bcs - like behavior of the gap has indeed been observed @xcite and suggests that the charge fluctuations in the particle - hole channel could substantially participate to the spectral features around the @xmath181 points . in this",
    "regards our finding supports the idea that the scattering induced by a charge ordered superstructure works in many aspects in the same direction than mechanisms involving incoherent pairing correlations ( possibly cooperating with magnetic scattering @xcite ) . on the other hand , we also found that a disordering of the eggbox structures `` washes out '' the weak low - energy features and brings about the disappearance of the leading - edge gap due to charge scattering , but preserves the feature of fermi surface only formed by disconnected arcs . in this last situation",
    ", the pseudogap will only appear as a ( robust ) suppression of the spectral weight , which is shifted at higher binding energies .",
    "the overall success of the eggbox cdw scattering in reproducing some highly non - trivial features of the single - particle spectra of the underdoped cuprates suggests that a dynamical charge pseudo - ordering is a relevant aspect of the physics of these materials .",
