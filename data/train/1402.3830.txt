    "in 2013 , on august 11 a user with nickname `` larry '' @xcite posted the following question in _ mathematics stack exchange _    how to prove that @xmath1    mathematics stack exchange is a question and answer site for people studying math at any level , and professionals in related fields .",
    "many times we see there questions of homework level .",
    "the above question received many comments but not a genuine answer .",
    "later , in 2014 , on the 18th of january , the same question was also posted in mathoverflow @xcite , which is a question and answer site for professional mathematicians .",
    "the question in mathoverflow was posted by a user with nickname `` zy _ '' . again , until now , we have not found a proof of in mathoverflow .    in mathematics stack exchange ( october 10 , 2013 )",
    "we also find a related integral posted by vladimir reshetnikov @xcite .",
    "this received two answers but no solution to question .",
    "although some of the comments ask for the origin of the value of the integral , this question has not been answered by larry .",
    "given the powerful methods existing today to guess such values @xcite , there is a possibility that the given value was just an educated guess .",
    "therefore , we think a proof of deserves to be published . it is a good example of complex integration , multivalued functions , and cauchy s theorem .",
    "the integral in is well defined .    for @xmath2 we have @xmath3 so that @xmath4 therefore , @xmath5 is a differentiable , strictly increasing and non negative function on @xmath6 .",
    "it follows that @xmath7 is continuous .",
    "also @xmath8 so that @xmath9 is continuous and bounded in @xmath6 .    in this paper @xmath10 always denotes the main branch of the logarithmic function defined by @xmath11 , with @xmath12 .",
    "this function is analytic in the complex plane with a cut along the negative real axis .",
    "let @xmath13 be the complex plane with four cuts , two along the real axis , one from @xmath14 to @xmath15 , the other from @xmath16 to @xmath17 , and two along the imaginary axis , one from @xmath18 to @xmath19 the other from @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "this is a star - shaped open set with center at @xmath22 .",
    "the function @xmath23 defined in extends to an analytic function on the simply connected open set @xmath24 and we have @xmath25 and @xmath26    we may write @xmath27 it is clear that this defines an analytic function in @xmath24 .",
    "we may integrate along the segment joining @xmath22 to @xmath28 , which by the star - shaped property of @xmath24 is contained in @xmath24 where the integrand @xmath29 is analytic .",
    "when @xmath30 we may integrate the taylor expansion @xmath31 which proves .",
    "the expression @xmath32 is a negative real number just in case @xmath33 is real and @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , @xmath35 is well defined and analytic in @xmath24 . in the same way",
    "we show that @xmath36 is well defined and analytic in @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , the right hand side of is an analytic function in @xmath24 .",
    "expanding in power series we see that the taylor series of this right hand side function coincides with the power series in .    from this",
    "it is clear that we have equality in for @xmath30 , and by analytic continuation we have equality for all @xmath28 .",
    "we have @xmath37    for all positive real values",
    "@xmath38 we have @xmath39 therefore , @xmath40 when @xmath41 we have @xmath42 , so that the above logarithm vanishes there . for @xmath38 near @xmath14",
    "we have @xmath43 by , so that the integrand is @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , the integral @xmath45 is well defined , completing the proof .",
    "[ analytic ] the function @xmath46 is an analytic function in the first quadrant .",
    "we will show that @xmath47 when @xmath33 is in the first quadrant .",
    "its @xmath48 is well defined and by composition of analytic functions it will be analytic .",
    "the bilinear function @xmath49 transforms the first quadrant into the points @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "then @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the bilinear transform @xmath56 transforms the first quadrant in the points @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath57 .",
    "so @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "then , for @xmath33 in the first quadrant , by @xmath61 @xmath62 it is also clear that at @xmath63 the function @xmath64 is analytic , because @xmath65 is analytic at @xmath63 and has a zero there .",
    "the function @xmath64 in proposition [ analytic ] has singularities of ramification at @xmath66 and @xmath67 , but has well defined limits at all other point of the boundary ( in fact it extends analytically at these points ) .",
    "this follows from the fact that for @xmath38 real we have @xmath23 real and @xmath68 purely imaginary , so that @xmath69 on the boundary of the first quadrant .    for @xmath34 in the first quadrant we have @xmath70",
    "take @xmath71 with @xmath72 very large . then by @xmath73",
    "so that we have , for @xmath74 , @xmath75 it follows that for the main branch of @xmath76 we have @xmath77 therefore , for these values of @xmath33 we have @xmath78 so that we only need to use the known expansion in taylor series to get the equality for @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "since @xmath65 and the expansion are both analytic for @xmath34 on the first quadrant , we get the equality for @xmath33 in the first quadrant with @xmath34 .",
    "we have @xmath79    we apply cauchy s theorem to @xmath64 @xmath80 here @xmath81 is the path shown in figure [ fig ] .",
    "we avoid the singularities by small semicircles of radius @xmath82 , where @xmath83 .",
    "the integrals along the small semicircles tend to @xmath22 when @xmath84 , so that by cauchy s theorem @xmath85 two of the integrals combine to give our integral .",
    "in fact @xmath86 and we have @xmath87 by for @xmath88 we have @xmath89 , so that @xmath90 then our two integrals are @xmath91 applying we get @xmath92 our equation , obtained by cauchy s theorem , may now be written as @xmath93 in a similar way we also find that @xmath94 with @xmath95 here @xmath72 and we substitute the values of @xmath23 and @xmath68 given by @xmath96 @xmath97 we arrive at @xmath98 both logarithms have the same real part .",
    "therefore , only the integrals of the imaginary parts remain @xmath99 substituting this in we get @xmath100    the last integral can be transformed in the following way @xmath101 since @xmath102 and @xmath103 is in the first quadrant , the function @xmath65 can be computed by .",
    "@xmath104 then for @xmath105 large enough @xmath106 and @xmath107 or is @xmath108 but we do not need to prove this . ]",
    "@xmath109 substituting this in we get @xmath110 taking limits for @xmath111 we get @xmath112",
    "i wish to express my thanks to jan van de lune ( hallum , the netherlands ) for his encouragements and linguistic assistance ."
