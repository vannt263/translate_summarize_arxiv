    "quantum search was introduced by grover s seminal work  @xcite , which described an evolution operator @xmath0 that can be written as a product of two operators @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the well - known grover operator and @xmath3 is the operator that marks one vector of the computational basis by changing its sign , for instance , if the marked element is 0 then @xmath4 and @xmath3 does nothing for the other elements .",
    "originally , grover presented his algorithm having database searching in mind .",
    "soon it became evident that the algorithm has a broader scope , can be used for searching more than one element , and is the simplest example of the technique called amplitude amplification  @xcite .",
    "it was also realized that the grover algorithm can be formulated as a coined quantum walk search on the complete graph  @xcite and , recently , it was shown that grover s algorithm is a staggered quantum walk on the complete graph using two tessellations : the first one has one polygon with all vertices and the second one has one polygon with the marked vertex only  @xcite .    a natural way to generalize grover s algorithm",
    "is by analyzing the quantum search on graphs different from the complete graph .",
    "for instance , results for the two - dimensional lattice with cyclic boundary conditions were presented in refs .",
    "@xcite and for the hypercube using the coined quantum walk in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "quantum search on the two - dimensional lattice using quantum walks has an interesting unfolding .",
    "ambainis  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used a quantum - walk - based search algorithm that finds the marked vertex in @xmath5 time after employing the method of amplitude amplification , where @xmath6 is the number of vertices . by adding an extra qubit to the system ,",
    "tulsi  @xcite was able to improve the time complexity to @xmath7 without using the amplitude - amplification method .",
    "afterwards , ambainis  _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite also showed how to eliminate amplitude amplification using the original algorithm and performing a classical post - processing search in order to obtain the time complexity @xmath7 without an extra qubit .",
    "this can be considered the best quantum search on the two - dimensional lattice up to now . in this work ,",
    "we present a new search algorithm on the two - dimensional lattice with the same time complexity @xmath7 without using coins .",
    "an open problem is to find an algorithm with time complexity @xmath8 , which would go beyond the square root of the hitting time of a random walk on the two - dimensional lattice .",
    "coinless quantum walks were analyzed in refs  @xcite and motivated the development a new model called staggered quantum walk  @xcite .",
    "the staggered model with two tessellations can exactly reproduce the evolution of all instances of szegedy s model  @xcite and the instances of the coined model that use the grover or hadamard coin .",
    "the extension with hamiltonians was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite adding more flexibility to the model .",
    "the results in the present paper could not be found without this extension .",
    "the evolution operator in the staggered model is the product of local operators , each one obtained from a graph tessellation .",
    "a tessellation is a partition of the vertex set so that each partition element is a clique .",
    "the union of the tessellations must cover all edges .",
    "the minimal number of tessellations depends on the graph structure and is related with the chromatic number of the clique graph .",
    "the simplest way to tessellate the two - dimensional lattice requires four colors and each tessellation comprises polygons of two vertices .",
    "consider the set of vertices @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are labels such that @xmath12 is even .",
    "the first tessellation called 00 is horizontal and comprises the polygons @xmath13 .",
    "the second called 01 is vertical and comprises the polygons @xmath14 .",
    "the third called 10 is horizontal and comprises the polygons @xmath15 .",
    "the fourth called 11 is vertical and comprises the polygons @xmath16 .",
    "each tessellation @xmath17 is associated with a unitary operator @xmath18 , where @xmath17 is either 00 or 01 or 10 , or 11 , @xmath19 is an angle , and @xmath20 is a reflection operator ( hermitian and unitary ) , where @xmath21 is the orthogonal projector on the subspace spanned by the vectors associated with the polygons of tessellation @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "the evolution operator is the product @xmath22 and the value of @xmath19 is @xmath23 .",
    "if one changes the order of tessellations 01 and 10 , one obtains another independent evolution operator , which seems to be worse for searching algorithms .",
    "we can split the vertices @xmath9 of the two - dimensional lattice in two classes using the parity of the index sum @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath12 is even , vertex @xmath9 is in the first class , otherwise it is in the second class . using those classes and exploring the translational symmetries of the two - dimensional lattice , we can define two sets of vectors @xmath24 and @xmath25 so that , for fixed @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the range @xmath28 , where @xmath6 is the number of vertices , their linear combination is invariant under the action of the evolution operator .",
    "this fact allows us to formulate a technique to find the spectrum of the evolution operator .    to search a marked vertex on a graph",
    ", we use the paradigm made explicit by the grover algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the vertices are marked by a unitary operator called oracle that inverts the sign of the marked vertices . without loss of generality ( due to the translational symmetries of the two - dimensional lattice ) , we consider vertex @xmath29 as the target .",
    "this reduces the amount of calculation to analyze the searching algorithm . in this case , the oracle is given by @xmath30 and the modified evolution operator by @xmath31 .    before starting to address analytically the evolution of this quantum walk ,",
    "we had numerically analyzed the time complexity of many a kind of staggered quantum walks with hamiltonians on the two - dimensional lattice using four tessellations  @xcite .",
    "the main conclusions were that the original staggered model ( with @xmath32 ) has no instance that finds the marked vertex quicker than random - walk - based algorithms even taking non - uniform vectors associated with the polygons .",
    "after trying many values of @xmath19 , the numerical results pointed out that two models had improvement over classical algorithms : the first is the one addressed in this paper , which finds the marked vertex in @xmath33 time with @xmath34 , and the second is the one using the evolution operator @xmath35 ( the order is permuted ) also with @xmath34 , which has time complexity @xmath36 , established via numerical methods . in both cases ,",
    "the time complexity quickly deteriorates when the value of @xmath19 moves away from @xmath23 .",
