    "modern few- and many - body calculations of nuclear structure and reactions are based on the picture of point - like nucleons interacting via two- and three - nucleon potentials . for this purpose , a number of high precision @xmath2 but phenomenological meson exchange models of the two - nucleon ( @xmath3 ) force such as the nijmegen  @xcite , argonne v18 ( av18 ) @xcite and cd - bonn  @xcite potentials have been developed over the past decade .",
    "however , with phenomenological models it is not clear how to construct consistent three - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) forces and other operators . the lack of a systematic organization or counting scheme results in model - dependent predictions , as there is no way to make controlled comparisons between the different force models .",
    "more recently , substantial progress has been made in constructing nuclear interactions from chiral effective field theory ( eft ) @xcite , which is based on the most general local lagrangian with nucleon and pion fields and all possible interactions consistent with the ( broken ) chiral symmetry of qcd .",
    "in contrast to phenomenological interaction models , the eft approach is universal and provides a model - independent framework with a systematic organization of consistent @xmath3 , @xmath0 and higher - body forces ( and other operators ) prescribed by the power counting .    for both phenomenological and eft potentials , nuclear few- and",
    "many - body calculations are complicated by strong short - range repulsion and tensor forces that necessitate highly correlated trial wave functions , non - perturbative resummations , and slowly convergent basis expansions .",
    "however , the non - perturbative nature of inter - nucleon interactions is strongly scale dependent and can be radically softened by using the renormalization group ( rg ) to lower the momentum cutoff that is present in all nuclear interactions .",
    "a consequence is that many - body calculations become much more tractable at lower resolutions , resulting in calculations that are amenable to straightforward perturbative methods , simple variational anstze , and rapidly convergent basis expansions  @xcite .",
    "the rg approach has the important advantage of being able to vary the cutoff as a tool to optimize and probe the quality of the many - body solution , and to provide estimates of omitted terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "the above considerations have motivated the construction of low - momentum potentials @xmath4through the renormalization group ( rg ) method @xcite and , more recently , by the similarity renormalization group ( srg ) method @xcite . both methods serve to eliminate the strong coupling between low- and high - momentum modes in the hamiltonian such that low - energy observables are preserved . in the rg method ,",
    "one integrates out the problematic high - momentum components of the input interaction above a momentum cutoff @xmath5 , leading to a new energy independent potential @xmath4that has the same low - energy on - shell transition matrix ( t - matrix ) as the input potential . in the original approach @xmath5 constitutes a sharp cutoff above which the t - matrix is zero ; the method has since been generalized to include a smooth momentum - space regulator to avoid technical difficulties stemming from the sharp cutoff @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the srg method uses a continuous sequence of unitary transformations that weakens off - diagonal matrix elements , driving the hamiltonian towards a band - diagonal form  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the rg method , srg preserves both low- and high - energy observables independent of the value of the flow parameter @xmath6 that provides a measure of the spread of off - diagonal strength .",
    "however , as with the standard rg , the calculation of low - energy observables is decoupled from the high - momentum physics with srg - evolved potentials ( i.e. , one can truncate intermediate state summations to low momenta without distorting low - energy observables ) .",
    "observables are scale - independent quantities .",
    "it is well - known that rg ( srg ) transformations generate short - range many - body forces ( in principle , up to @xmath7-body ) that `` run '' with the cutoff to maintain exact @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) independence of @xmath7-body observables .",
    "if the rg transformation is truncated at the @xmath3 level , then the resulting cutoff - dependence in @xmath0 observables may provide an estimate of omitted short - range @xmath0 forces in the hamiltonian . along these lines ,",
    "low - momentum @xmath3 potentials have been recently used in three- and four - nucleon@xmath8 bound state calculations @xcite as a means to assess the size of omitted higher - body forces by varying the cutoff .",
    "there , it was found that the induced @xmath0 forces due to the truncation to low momentum are of the same order as the so - called `` bare '' @xmath0 forces attributed to integrating out excitations of nucleons .",
    "that is , the cutoff - dependence of the @xmath0 binding energies was rather weak , varying by only 1 mev over a large cutoff range , which is comparable to the @xmath9-@xmath10 mev binding provided by the missing `` bare '' @xmath0 forces in conventional models and eft calculations . in this sense",
    ", the rg evolution to low momentum does not induce strong short - ranged three - body force contributions to these @xmath0 bound state observables .",
    "similar results were obtained in @xmath1 bound state calculations , where the various @xmath3 @xmath4calculations did not differ any more from the phenomenological tjon - line than did calculations using @xmath3 plus adjusted @xmath0 forces .    in the current study , we extend the cutoff - dependence study of ref .",

    "these being the two major long - standing failures of realistic interactions in their description of @xmath0 data at low energy , one would like to use cutoff - dependence as a tool to assess the sensitivity of these observables to omitted short - range @xmath0 force effects .",
    "likewise , the same applies to observables in @xmath1 scattering that show large deviations to data , namely the total neutron - triton @xmath14 cross section @xmath15 around the resonance region at neutron lab energy @xmath16 mev and the @xmath17 @xmath12 that also misses the data by as much as 25 - 40% .    in section  [ sec:3n ]",
