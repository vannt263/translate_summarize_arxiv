    "over the last few years , the study of opinion formation in complex networks has attracted a growing amount of works and becomes the major trend of sociophysics  @xcite .",
    "many models have been proposed , like those of deffuant  @xcite , galam  @xcite , krause - hegselmann ( kh )  @xcite , and sznajd  @xcite .",
    "but most models in the literature consider two - state opinion agents , in favor ( @xmath0 ) or against ( @xmath1 ) about a certain topic . in the galam",
    "s majority rule and the sznajd s updating rule , the interaction between the agents is randomly changed during the evolution , and the time to reach consensus is associated with the initial traction @xmath2 of @xmath0 state .",
    "the consensus time @xmath3 reaches its maximal value at @xmath4 . in the sznajd model",
    ", a pair of nearest neighbors convinces its neighbors to adopt the pair opinion if and only if both members have the same opinion . otherwise the pair and",
    "its neighbors do not change opinion . in the kh consensus model ,",
    "the opinions between @xmath5 and @xmath6 and a confidence bound parameter is introduced .",
    "the agent @xmath7 would take the average opinion of all neighboring agents that are within a confidence bound during the evolution . in the deffuant model ,",
    "the opinion of two randomly selected neighboring agents @xmath7 and @xmath8 would remain unchanged , if their opinions @xmath9 and @xmath10 differ by more than a fixed threshold parameter .",
    "otherwise , each opinion moves into the direction of the other by an amount @xmath11 .",

    "the complex network models , such as the lattice network , the random network  @xcite , the small - world network  @xcite , and the scale - free network  @xcite , are studied in many branches of science .",
