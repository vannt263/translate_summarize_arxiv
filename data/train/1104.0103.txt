    "the equation of state ( eos ) of asymmetric nuclear matter becomes one of the hot topics in today s nuclear physics , simply because its isovector part , i.e. , the symmetry energy , is a fundamental and crucial ingredient in the investigations of exotic nuclei , heavy - ion collisions , and astrophysical phenomena @xcite . while currently the theoretical predictions on the symmetry energy are quite diverse @xcite .",
    "heavy - ion reactions induced by neutron - rich nuclei , especially radioactive beams , provide a unique opportunity to constrain the symmetry energy term in the eos of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter @xcite . nuclear reaction induced by the proton - rich ( @xmath4 ) nuclei",
    "was also studied recently @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is to identify experimental observables that are sensitive to the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "however , it is very challenging to find such observables since the compression phase is formed only transiently in heavy - ion reactions .",
    "moreover , most hadronic observables are affected by both the isospin symmetric and asymmetric parts of the eos at all densities throughout the whole dynamical evolution of the reaction . and",
    "experimental observables are also affected by nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath5 ) cross sections @xcite and momentum dependence of isovector mean - field potential @xcite .",
    "thus rather delicate observables have to be selected to probe the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy , especially at high densities .",
    "the neutron to proton ratio @xcite , the neutron - proton bremsstrahlung @xcite , the @xmath6 ratio @xcite , the neutron - proton differential flow @xcite and the @xmath7 ratio @xcite were proposed for this purpose . in all the above studies , initialization effect in heavy - ion collisions at intermediate energies was seldom mentioned . in this note , based on the isospin - dependent boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck transport model plus the skyrme force parameters , we studied initialization effect in heavy - ion collisions at intermediate energies .",
    "we find that there are moderate initialization effects in some common experimental observables relating to nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "the isospin and momentum - dependent mean - field potential used in the present work is @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote neutron ( @xmath11 ) and proton ( @xmath12 ) densities , respectively .",
    "@xmath13 is the isospin asymmetry of nuclear medium .",
    "all parameters in the preceding equation can be found in refs .",
    "the variable @xmath14 is introduced to mimic different forms of the symmetry energy predicted by various many - body theories without changing any property of symmetric nuclear matter and the value of symmetry energy at normal density @xmath15 . because the purpose of present studies is just to see how large the effect of nuclear initialization on experimental observables , we just let the variable @xmath14 be @xmath16 .",
    "the main characteristic of the present single particle is the momentum dependence of nuclear symmetry potential , which has evident effect on energetic free @xmath0 ratio and @xmath3 ratio in heavy - ion collisions @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we use the isospin - dependent in - medium reduced @xmath5 elastic scattering cross section from the scaling model according to nucleon effective mass @xcite . for in - medium @xmath5 inelastic scattering cross section",
    ", we use the forms in free space since it is quite controversial . for nuclear initializations ,",
    "we use the skyrme - hartree - fock with skyrme @xmath17 ( sm ) and skyrme @xmath18 ( s1 ) force parameters @xcite .",
    "au with skyrme @xmath17 ( sm ) and skyrme @xmath18 ( s1 ) force parameters @xcite , respectively .",

    "[ dis ] we can see that nucleonic distributions are more diffused with the sm force parameters .",
    "more clearly , from the inset figure of fig .  [ dis ] , we can see that @xmath0 of nucleonic distributions splits with the two set of force parameters in the marginal area of nucleus while the values of @xmath0 are almost the same in the core of nucleus .",
    "the sm parameters match small @xmath0 while the s1 parameters give large @xmath0 .",
    "we also initialized the light nuclei @xmath20ca and @xmath21ca , their nucleonic distributions show the same features .",

    "[ rnp ] shows initialization effect on the free @xmath0 .",
    "we can see that for all the reaction systems , whether light or heavy , there are almost no initialization effects . before this",
    ", one always think that effects of initialization are large for light reaction system .",
    "our studies show that we can thoroughly neglect effects of initialization on free @xmath0 of preeqilibrium emission . from fig .",
    "[ rnp ] , we can also see that effects of initialization on free @xmath0 are not affected by asymmetry of reaction system .",
    "ratio in central reactions of @xmath21ca+@xmath21ca , @xmath20ca+@xmath20ca and @xmath19au+@xmath19au at 400 mev / nucleon.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we next turn to the studies of effects of initialization on @xmath3 ratio .",
    "@xmath3 ratio recently becomes a very hot probe owing to its connection with the high - density behavior of nuclear symmetry energy @xcite .",
    "[ rpion ] shows effects of initialization on charged @xmath3 ratio in central reactions of @xmath21ca+@xmath21ca , @xmath20ca+@xmath20ca and @xmath19au+@xmath19au at 400 mev / nucleon .",
    "we can first see that effects of initialization are larger on @xmath3 ratio than free @xmath0 . for heavy system @xmath19au+@xmath19au , effects of initialization are larger than light systems @xmath21ca+@xmath21ca and @xmath20ca+@xmath20ca .",
    "again we here do not see a large initialization effect for light system .",
    "and we also do not see a large initialization effect on @xmath3 ratio from the reaction system with larger asymmetry . for s1 force parameters , we see small @xmath22 ratio than sm force parameters for the two large n / z systems @xmath19au+@xmath19au and @xmath21ca+@xmath21ca .",
    "this is because the s1 force parameters make the n / z of nucleus in marginal area large ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ dis ] ) .",
    "the central area of nucleus , which goes though a large compression and produces pions , matches small n / z . while the @xmath23 ratio is approximately @xmath24 in central heavy - ion reactions with @xmath25 and @xmath26 being the total neutron and proton numbers in the participant region @xcite , s1 force parameters thus matches small values of @xmath1 ratio . in the calculations , effects of initialization on the central reactions of @xmath21ca+@xmath21ca ,",
    "@xmath20ca+@xmath20ca and @xmath19au+@xmath19au at 400 mev / nucleon are 1.6% , 2.9% and 3.5% , respectively .",
    "we therefore can almost neglect initialization effect in heavy - ion collisions while using charged pion ratio to probe the density - dependent symmetry energy .",
    "ratio and free @xmath0 ratio in the @xmath19au+@xmath19au reaction with an impact parameter of 8 fm.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    studies show that charged @xmath3 ratio may be more sensitive to nuclear symmetry energy at lower incident beam energies via subthreshold pion production @xcite .",
    "we thus make a study of beam energy dependence of initialization effects on charged @xmath3 ratio as well as free @xmath0 ratio in the @xmath19au+@xmath19au reaction with an impact parameter of 8 fm . from fig .",
    "[ edep ] , we again see that free @xmath0 of preequilibrium emission shows no initialization effects with the decrease of beam energy .",
    "while for @xmath3 ratio , effects of initialization seems larger for lower incident beam energies . also we can clearly see that the values of @xmath22 ratio become larger with the decrease of beam energy .",
    "this trend is consistent with recent studies @xcite . comparing with the case of sm",
    ", s1 always gives large @xmath3 ratio in semi - central collision owing to the large n / z of compression phase ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ dis ] ) .",
    "therefore , it seems necessary to consider initialization effect of nucleus while using @xmath3 ratio to study nuclear symmetry energy via subthreshold pion production .",
    "one way is that the force parameters used for the initialization of nucleus give rough the `` correct '' symmetry energy value around saturation density .",
    "the other way is making the force parameters give the same symmetry energy , which can be deduced by the mean - field potential used in the model .",

    "we can first see that the values of @xmath22 ratio increase with the impact parameter owing to the large n / z of compression phase .",
    "initialization effect , however , does not keep stable . comparing with the case of sm",
    ", s1 gives small @xmath3 ratio in central collision and shows large @xmath3 ratio in semi - central collision and for marginal collision s1 again provides small @xmath3 ratio .",
    "we also see that free @xmath0 of preequilibrium emission shows no initialization effects with the increase of impact parameter .",

    "the neutron - proton differential transverse flow was defined as @xcite @xmath27where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the number of free nucleons , neutrons and protons , respectively , at rapidity @xmath31 ; @xmath32 is the transverse momentum of the free nucleon at rapidity @xmath31 ; @xmath33 @xmath34 for neutrons ( protons ) ; and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are respectively the average transverse momenta of neutrons and protons at rapidity @xmath31 .",
    "the neutron - proton differential flow combines effects due to both the isospin fractionation and the different transverse flows of neutrons and protons .",

    "it is clearly shown that effects of initialization on neutron - proton differential flow parameter are large with the increase of impact parameter owing to large difference of nucleonic flow of emitting nucleons .",
    "in conclusion , based on a transport model ibuu plus the skyrme force parameters , we studied the effects of initialization on several probes in heavy - ion collisions at intermediate energies .",
