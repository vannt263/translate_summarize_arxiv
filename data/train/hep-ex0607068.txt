    "the @xmath11 meson , with quark composition @xmath12 , decays by a cabibbo - allowed decay to @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , and by a doubly - suppressed decay to @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) .",

    "the observable final states are _ not _ @xmath21 or @xmath22 , but rather @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "as pointed out by bigi and yamamoto many years ago @xcite , interference between cabibbo - allowed and doubly - suppressed transitions leads to differences in the rates for @xmath25 and @xmath26 . here",
    "we describe a search for differences in the decay rates , both for @xmath27 vs. @xmath28 and for @xmath29 vs. @xmath30 .",
    "( throughout , charge - conjugate modes implied , except where noted . )    for these measurements we have used a sample of 281 pb@xmath2 @xmath31 events , produced with the cesr - c storage ring and observed with the cleo - c detector .",
    "the data sample contains approximately 820,000 @xmath32 events and 1,030,000 @xmath33 events , as well as @xmath34 continuum events , @xmath35 events , bhabha events , and @xmath36-pairs .",
    "the resonance @xmath3 is below the threshold for @xmath37 , and so the events of interest , @xmath38 , have @xmath39 mesons with energy equal to the beam energy and a unique momentum .    for the decays",
    "@xmath40 , we make no attempt to detect the @xmath24 , as this is not feasible with the cleo - c detector .",
    "rather , we fully reconstruct a tag @xmath41 on `` the other side , '' detect the @xmath42 , and compute the missing mass squared .",
    "our signal is a peak at the @xmath24 mass squared .    explicitly , for @xmath28 , we reconstruct the @xmath43 in 6 decay modes .",
    "we do this by requiring that the candidate @xmath43 has energy consistent with the beam energy , and `` beam - constrained - mass''(@xmath44 ) consistent with the @xmath43 mass . given a reconstructed @xmath43 meson , we require that the remainder of the event ( the `` @xmath11 side '' ) contain only one charged track ( for the @xmath45 ) , and that any calorimeter clusters do _ not _ form a @xmath46 .",
    "we then compute the missing mass @xmath47 in the reaction @xmath48 .",

    ", we follow a similar procedure .",
    "we reconstruct @xmath49 in the decay modes @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . given a reconstructed @xmath49 meson , we require that the `` @xmath17 side '' contains no charged tracks , only one @xmath53 , and no @xmath54 .",
    "we then compute the missing mass @xmath47 in the reaction @xmath55 .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : mm2_1pi0_pull4_d ] , with the @xmath24 peak evident .    for @xmath56",
    ", we use the result of an independent cleo - c analysis that measures many @xmath17 and @xmath11 hadronic branching fractions , including @xmath56 .",
    "@xcite this decay is directly reconstructed , using @xmath57 .",
    "unfortunately , the analysis on the full 281 pb@xmath2 sample is not yet complete ; the result we use is based on a 56 pb@xmath2 subset .",
    "an updated result , with approximately half the uncertainty , will be available soon .",
    "no previous cleo - c analysis has measured @xmath29 , so we have also analyzed this mode .",
    "we directly reconstruct this mode , either tagged with a reconstructed @xmath58 (  double tag \" ) or not tagged (  single tag \" ) .",
    "the situation for @xmath29 vs. @xmath59 has an added feature . when @xmath17 and @xmath49 are pair - produced through a virtual photon(@xmath60 ) , they are in a quantum coherent state",
    ". then the decays of @xmath17 and @xmath49 will follow a set of selection rules .",
    "they can not decay to cp eigenstates with the same cp eigenvalue , if we ignore cp violation in @xmath61 system . on the other hand ,",
    "decays to cp eigenstates with opposite cp eigenvalues are enhanced .",
    "similarly , all other final states are subject to such inteference effects . as a result ,",
    "the measured branching fractions in this @xmath61 system differ from those of isolated @xmath17 mesons .",
    "the measured branching fractions of the same mode by double tag and single tag methods will also differ from each other , especially for cp eigenstate modes .",
    "the quantum correlation effects are shown in table  [ table : qc ] , where `` f '' stands for flavored modes , `` x '' stands for everything , `` @xmath62 '' stands for cp even modes , `` @xmath63 '' stands for cp odd modes , and    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the amplitude ratio of `` wrong sign '' decay(@xmath66 for example ) to `` right sign '' decay(@xmath67 for example ) and @xmath68 is the phase difference .    .single tag and double tag yields for @xmath69 @xmath70 events , to leading order in x and y. [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have measured the braching fraction of @xmath59 in the tagged data sample , and the branching fraction of @xmath71 in both tagged and untagged samples .",
    "we use the two branching fractions of @xmath71 to get the correction factor,@xmath72 , and then apply the correction factor , @xmath73 , to the branching fraction of @xmath74 to get the true branching fraction of @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath75 is taken from recent belle results @xcite , @xcite . by using the pdg value of `` y '' ,",
    "the branching fraction for @xmath29 was corrected to be @xmath76",
    ". then we calculate @xmath77 for each tag mode separately . after correcting the branching fractions for the three tags separately and combining the results together ,",
    "we get the branching fraction for @xmath30 : @xmath78 .",
    "note that the @xmath46 systematic uncertainty is not included .",
    "to compare @xmath79 and @xmath80 , we compute the asymmetries @xmath81 the error propagation in the asymmetry is complicated by correlations between the branching fractions .",
    "for example , the @xmath80 measurements include an input @xmath79 branching fraction , so the two branching fractions are anti - correlated .",
    "also , the @xmath17 measurements both include the same @xmath46 systematic , so this systematic cancels .",
    "the @xmath11 asymmetry is @xmath82 the uncertainties are dominated by the @xmath83 measurement , which used only a 56 pb@xmath2 subset of the 281 pb@xmath2 data set .",
    "we expect an updated result soon , so the uncertainties on the asymmetry will improve significantly .",
    "the @xmath17 asymmetry is @xmath84 this systematic uncertainty will also improve when the @xmath85 cross section measurement is updated with the full 281 pb@xmath2 data set .",
    "the asymmetry measurements allow a measurement of the strong phase between @xmath86 and @xmath87 under reasonable theoretical assumptions .",
    "the three cabibbo - favored @xmath88 decays are described by an isospin 1/2 amplitude @xmath89 , an isospin 3/2 amplitude @xmath90 , and their relative phase @xmath91 .",
    "the amplitudes are @xmath92 without loss of generality , we may take @xmath89 and @xmath90 to be real and positive .",
    "the four doubly - cabibbo - suppressed @xmath88 decays are described by one isospin 3/2 amplitude @xmath93 , and two isospin 1/2 amplitudes @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that @xmath93 and @xmath90 are relatively real , and that @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath89 are relatively real .",
    "we can then write the amplitudes for the four doubly - suppressed decays @xmath96    in our notation , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath93 are all real , and the phase in any amplitude comes from @xmath91 .",
    "we thus have six parameters to describe seven decays .",
    "a complete fit is underway , but results are not yet available .",
    "instead , we illustrate what will be forthcoming by making some approximations .    the exact expressions for the asymmetries ( defined in equation [ eq : asymdef ] ) are @xmath97 } { |a_{1/2 } - \\sqrt{2}a_{3/2}e^{-i\\delta_i}|^2 + |(b_{1/2}+c_{1/2 } ) - \\sqrt{2}b_{3/2}e^{-i\\delta_i}|^2 } \\label{eq : rdzexact } \\\\",

    "furthermore , we assume that @xmath100 is negligibly small compared to @xmath101 .",
    "thus , in the denominators of the expressions for @xmath102 , the second terms ( with only @xmath103 s and @xmath104 s ) are ignored .",
