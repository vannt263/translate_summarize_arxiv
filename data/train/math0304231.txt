    "( kable - yukie ) .",
    "the conjecture is true in the weak sense for @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    the methods used to prove these results are quite diverse .",
    "in the case of abelian groups @xmath2 , one could think that class field theory gives all the answers so nothing much would need to be done .",
    "this is not at all the case , and in fact kummer theory is usually more useful . in addition , kummer theory allows us more generally to study solvable groups .",
    "we will look at this method in detail .",
    "apart from kummer theory and class field theory , the other methods have a different origin and come from the classification of _ orders _ of degree @xmath3 , interpreted through suitable classes of _ forms_.",
    "this can be done at a very clever but still elementary level when the base field is @xmath44 , and includes the remarkable achievement of m.  bhargava in 2001 for quartic orders . over arbitrary @xmath0",
    ", one needs to use and develop the theory of prehomogeneous vector spaces , initiated at the end of the 1960 s by sato and shintani ( see for example @xcite and @xcite ) , and used since with great success by datskovsky - wright , and more recently by wright - yukie ( see @xcite ) , yukie and kable - yukie .",
    "-5 mm    this method applies only to abelian , or more generally solvable extensions .",
    "-5 mm    it is first important to explain why class field theory , which is supposed to be a complete theory of abelian extensions , does not give an answer to counting questions .",
    "let us take the very simplest example of quadratic extensions , thus with @xmath45 .",
    "a trivial class - field theoretic argument gives the exact formula @xmath46 where @xmath47 runs over all integral ideals of @xmath0 of norm less than or equal to @xmath48 , @xmath49 denotes the narrow ray class group modulo @xmath47 , @xmath50 denotes the @xmath51-rank of an abelian group @xmath2 , and @xmath52 is the generalization to number fields of the summatory function @xmath53 of the mbius function .",
    "this formula is completely explicit , the quantities @xmath49 and the function @xmath52 are algorithmically computable with reasonable efficiency , so we can compute @xmath54 for reasonably small values of @xmath48 in this way .",
    "unfortunately , this formula has two important drawbacks .",
    "the first and essential one is that , if we want to deduce from it asymptotic information on @xmath54 , we need to control @xmath55 , which can be done , although rather painfully , but we also need to control @xmath52 , which _ can not _ be done ( recall for instance that the riemann hypothesis can be formulated in terms of this function ) .",
    "the second drawback is that , even for exact computation it is rather inefficient , compared to the formula that we obtain from kummer theory .",
    "thus , even though kummer theory is used in a crucial way for the constructions needed in the proofs of class field theory , it must not be discarded once this is done since the formula that it gives are much more useful , at least in our context .",
    "-5 mm    as an example , let us see how to treat quadratic extensions using kummer theory instead of class field theory . of course in this case",
    "kummer theory is trivial since it tells us that quadratic extensions of @xmath0 are parameterized by @xmath56 minus the unit class .",
    "this is not explicit enough . by writing for any @xmath57 , @xmath58 with @xmath47 an integral squarefree ideal ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath56 is in one - to - one correspondence with pairs @xmath59 , where @xmath47 are integral squarefree ideals whose ideal class is a square , and @xmath60 is an element of the so - called selmer group of @xmath0 , i.e. , the group of elements @xmath61 such that @xmath62 for some ideal @xmath63 , divided by @xmath64 . we can then introduce the dirichlet series @xmath65 , where the sum is over quadratic extensions @xmath5 in @xmath1 .",
    "a number of not completely trivial combinatorial and number - theoretic computations ( see @xcite ) lead to the explicit formula @xmath66 where @xmath67 runs over all quadratic characters of the ray class group @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the ordinary dirichlet - hecke @xmath8-function attached to @xmath67 .",
    "there are two crucial things to note in this formula .",
    "first of all , the sum on @xmath70 is only on integral ideals dividing @xmath51 , so is finite and very small .",
    "thus , @xmath71 is a finite linear combination of euler products , and can directly be used much more efficiently than the formula coming from class field theory to compute @xmath54 exactly .",
    "for example ( but this of course does not need the above machinery ) we obtain @xmath72 .    second , since @xmath69 extends to a meromorphic function in the whole complex plane with no pole if @xmath67 is not a trivial character , the polar part of @xmath71 , which is the only thing that we need for an asymptotic formula , comes only from the contributions of the trivial characters , in which case @xmath69 is equal to @xmath73 times a finite number of euler factors .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a convenient abuse of notation for the residue of @xmath73 at @xmath76 . apparently this simple result was first obtained by datskovsky - wright in @xcite ,",
    "although their proof is different .",
    "-5 mm    the same method can in principle be applied to any finite abelian group @xmath2 .",
    "i say `` in principle '' , because in practice several problems arise . for the base field @xmath14 ,",
    "a complete and explicit solution was given by mki in @xcite . for a general base field ,",
    "a solution has been given by wright in @xcite , but the problem with his solution is that the constant @xmath32 , although given as a product of local contributions , can not be computed explicitly without a considerable amount of additional work .",
    "it is always a finite linear combination of euler products .    in joint work with f.  diaz y diaz and m.  olivier ,",
    "using kummer theory in a manner analogous but much more sophisticated than the case of quadratic extensions , we have computed completely explicitly the constants @xmath32 for @xmath77 the cyclic group of prime order @xmath28 , for @xmath78 and for @xmath79 .",
    "although our papers are perhaps slightly too discursive , to give an idea the total number of pages for these three results exceeds 100 .",
    "we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for the detailed proofs , and to @xcite and @xcite for surveys and tables of results .",
    "we mention here the simplest one , for @xmath80 .",
    "we have @xmath81 @xmath82 of course , the main difficulty is to compute correctly the local factor at @xmath51 .    as usual",
    ", we can use our methods to compute very efficiently the @xmath83 function .",
    "for example , we obtain ( see @xcite ) : @xmath84      -5 mm    we can also apply our method to solvable extensions .",
    "the case of quartic @xmath85-extensions , where @xmath85 is the dihedral group of order @xmath86 , is especially simple and pretty .",
    "such an extension is imprimitive , i.e. , is a quadratic extension of a quadratic extension .",
    "conversely , imprimitive quartic extensions are either @xmath85-extensions , or abelian with galois group @xmath87 or @xmath88 .",
    "these can easily be counted as explained above , and in any case will not contribute to the main term of the asymptotic formula , so they can be neglected ( or subtracted for exact computations ) .",
    "since we have treated completely the case of quadratic extensions , it is just a matter of showing that we are allowed to sum over quadratic extensions of the base field to obtain the desired asymptotic formula ( for the exact formula nothing needs to be proved ) , and this is not difficult . in this way",
    ", we obtain that @xmath89 for an explicit constant @xmath90 ( in fact we obtain an error term @xmath91 ) .",
    "this result is new even for @xmath14 , although its proof not very difficult . in the case",
    "@xmath14 , we have for instance @xmath92 where the sum is over fundamental discriminants @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 is the usual dirichlet series for the character @xmath96 .    * remark .",
    "* in the abelian case , it is possible to compute the euler products which occur to hundreds of decimal places if desired using almost standard zeta - product expansions , see for example @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we do not know if it is possible to express @xmath97 as a finite linear combination of euler products ( or at least as a rapidly convergent infinite series of such ) , hence we have only been able to compute 9 or 10 decimal places of this constant .",
    "we do not see any practical way of computing 20 decimals , say .",
    "our method also allows us to compute @xmath98 exactly .",
    "however , here a miracle occurs : when @xmath99 is a quadratic field , in the formula that we have given above for @xmath100 all the quadratic characters @xmath67 which we need are _ genus characters _ in the sense of gauss , in other words there is a decomposition @xmath101 into a product of two suitable ordinary dirichlet @xmath8-series .",
    "this gives a very fast method for computing @xmath98 , and in particular we have been able to compute @xmath102 .",
    "we can also count the number of extensions with a given signature .",
    "the method is completely similar , but here not all characters are genus characters .",
    "in fact , it is only necessary to add a single nongenus character to obtain all the necessary ones , but everything is completely explicit , and closely related to the _ rational quartic reciprocity law_. i refer to @xcite for details .",
    "-5 mm    we can also prove some partial results in the case where @xmath103 or @xmath40 ( of course the results for @xmath104 are superseded by bhargava s for @xmath14 , and by yukie s for general @xmath0 ; still , the method is also useful for exact computations ) , see @xcite .    in the case of quartic @xmath105 and @xmath104-extensions ( or , for that matter , of cubic @xmath106-extensions )",
    ", we use the diagram involving the cubic resolvent ( the quadratic one for @xmath106-extensions ) , also called the hasse diagram .",
    "we then have a situation which bears some analogies with the @xmath85 case .",
    "the differences are as follows . instead of having to sum over quadratic extensions of the base field @xmath0",
    ", we must sum over cubic extensions , cyclic for @xmath105 and noncyclic for @xmath104 .",
    "as in the @xmath85-case , we then have to consider quadratic extensions of these cubic fields , but generated by an element of square norm .",
    "it is possible to go through the exact combinatorial and arithmetic computation of the corresponding dirichlet series , the cubic field being fixed .",
    "this in particular uses some amusing local class field theory . as in the @xmath85 case , we then obtain the dirichlet generating series for discriminants of @xmath105 ( resp .",
    ", @xmath104 ) extensions by summing the series over the corresponding cubic fields .",
    "unfortunately , we can not obtain from this any asymptotic formula .",
    "the reason is different in the @xmath105 and the @xmath104 case . in the @xmath105 case ,",
    "the rightmost singularity of the dirichlet series is at @xmath107 .",
    "unfortunately , this is simultaneously the main singularity of each individual dirichlet series , and also that of the generating series for cyclic cubic fields .",
    "thus , although the latter is well understood , it seems difficult ( but not totally out of reach ) to paste things together . on the other hand , we can do two things rigorously in this case .",
    "first , we can prove an asymptotic formula for @xmath105-extensions having a _ fixed _ cubic resolvent .",
    "tables show that the formula is very accurate .",
    "second , we can use our formula to compute @xmath108 exactly .",
    "for instance , we have computed @xmath109 .",
    "this computation is much slower than in the @xmath85-case , because we do not have the miracle of genus characters , and we must compute the class and unit group of all the cyclic cubic fields .    in the @xmath104 case , the situation is different .",
    "the main singularity of each individual dirichlet series is still at @xmath107 ( because of the square norm condition ) , and the rightmost singularity of the generating series for noncyclic cubic fields is at @xmath76 , so the situation looks better ( and analogous to the @xmath85 situation with @xmath110 replaced by @xmath111 ) .",
    "unfortunately , as already mentioned we know almost nothing about the generating series for noncyclic cubic fields , a fortiori with coefficients .",
    "so we can not go further in the asymptotic analysis .",
    "as in the @xmath105 case , however , we can compute exactly either the number of @xmath104-extensions corresponding to a fixed cubic resolvent , or even @xmath108 itself .",
    "the problem is that here we must compute class and unit groups of all noncyclic cubic fields of discriminant up to @xmath48 , while cyclic cubic fields of discriminant up to @xmath48 are much rarer , of the order of @xmath112 instead .",
    "we have thus not been able to go very far and obtained for example @xmath113 .",
    "-5 mm    the other methods for studying @xmath18 are two closely related methods : one is the use of generalizations of the delone - fadeev map , which applies when @xmath14 . the other , which can be considered as a generalization of the first , is the use of the theory of prehomogeneous vector spaces , initiated by sato and shintani in the 1960 s .        we briefly give a sketch of the first method .",
    "we would first like to classify _",
    "quadratic _ orders .",
    "it is well known that , through their discriminant , such orders are in one - to - one correspondence with the subset of nonsquare elements of @xmath114 congruent to @xmath115 or @xmath26 modulo @xmath116 , on which @xmath117 ( the trivial group ) acts .",
    "thus , for fixed discriminant , the orbits are finite ( in fact of cardinality @xmath115 or @xmath26 ) . for _ maximal _ orders , we need to add local arithmetic conditions at each prime @xmath118 , which are easy for @xmath119 , and slightly more complicated for @xmath120 .",
    "we do the same for small higher degrees . for _ cubic _ orders ,",
    "the classification is due to davenport - heilbronn ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these orders are in one - to - one correspondence with a certain subset of @xmath121 , i.e. , binary cubic forms , on which @xmath122 acts . since once again the difference in `` dimensions '' is @xmath123 , for fixed discriminant the orbits are finite , at least generically . for maximal orders ,",
    "we again need to add local arithmetic conditions at each prime @xmath118 .",
    "these are easy to obtain for @xmath124 , but are a little more complicated for @xmath120 and @xmath125 .",
    "an alternate way of explaining this is to say that a cubic order can be given by a _",
    "cubic equation , which is almost canonical if representatives are suitably chosen .    for _ quartic _ orders , the classification is due to m.  bhargava in 2001 , who showed in complete detail how to generalize the above .",
    "these orders are now in one - to - one correspondence with a certain subset of @xmath126 , i.e. , pairs of ternary quadratic forms , on which @xmath127 acts .",
    "once again the difference in `` dimensions '' is @xmath128 , so for fixed discriminant the orbits are finite , at least generically . for maximal orders ,",
    "we again need to add local arithmetic conditions at each prime @xmath118 , which bhargava finds after some computation .",
    "an alternate way of explaining this is to say that a quartic order can be given by the intersection of two conics in the projective plane , the pencil of conics being almost canonical if representatives are suitably chosen .    for _ quintic _ orders ,",
    "only part of the work has been done , by bhargava and kable - yukie in 2002 .",
    "these are in one - to - one correspondence with a certain subset of @xmath129 , i.e. , quadruples of alternating forms in @xmath130 variables , on which @xmath131 acts .",
    "once again the difference in `` dimensions '' is @xmath132 , so for fixed discriminant the orbits are finite , at least generically .",
    "the computation of the local arithmetic conditions , as well as the justification for the process of point counting near the cusps of the fundamental domain has however not yet been completed .          using the above methods , and generalizations to arbitrary base fields ,",
    "the following results have been obtained on the function @xmath18 ( many other deep and important results have also been obtained , but we fix our attention to this function ) .",
    "it is important to note that they seem out of reach using more classical methods such as kummer theory or class field theory mentioned earlier .      1 .",

    "there exists a strictly positive constant @xmath145 such that for all @xmath35 we have @xmath146    * remark . *",
    "it should also be emphasized that , although the above methods give important and deep results on @xmath18 for certain groups @xmath2 , they shed almost no light on the possible analytic continuation of the corresponding dirichlet series of which @xmath18 is the counting function .",
    "for example , in the simplest case where @xmath14 , @xmath37 , and @xmath17 , for which the result dates back to davenport - heilbronn , no one knows how to give an analytic continuation of the dirichlet series @xmath147 even to @xmath148 ( the sum being over cubic fields in @xmath149 and @xmath150 being the absolute discriminant of @xmath8 ) .",
