    "nonequilibrium quantum open system involves understanding the quantum fluctuation and dissipation processes arising from the interaction between the open system and its surrounding environment @xcite .",
    "most researches on nonequilibrium dynamics have been focused on ambient noises from a single environment or several uncorrelated environments .",
    "however , in experimental environments a quantum system may be exposed to various kind of physical noises such as phase noise , amplitude noise , as well as classical noises . in many realistic situations ,",
    "the participating noises are not totally statistically independent .",
    "two distant atom - cavity systems connected by a fiber constitute an important example in the quantum network realization @xcite . generally ,",
    "when the environment is formed by two or more mutually - interacting sub - environments , the correlations between the sub - environments will give rise to new physics on relaxation and decoherence across wide parameter regions interpolating totally uncorrelated individual environments and a single common environment . a deep understanding of the multi - correlation dynamical processes of open qubit systems",
    "holds enormous promise for both fundamental studies of non - markovian quantum phenomena as well as practical applications to quantum information processing .",
    "there are several approaches to solving quantum open systems coupled to an environment , including , e.g. , the perturbative master equations @xcite , the quantum trajectories @xcite , the dressed state method for simple open systems @xcite , feynman - vernon influence functional @xcite , and the projection operator approach that has been extensively used in statistical physics @xcite . as a new approach ,",
    "a stochastic schrdinger equation called non - markovian quantum - state - diffusion ( qsd ) equation driven by a complex gaussian noise was developed to describe an open quantum system that is coupled to bosonic environments , including individual bath @xcite and common bath @xcite .",
    "however , when the acting environment is comprised of multi - correlated parts , each consisting of finite or infinite degrees of freedom , it is still a challenging task to establish a fully quantized theory to accurately describe the non - markovian dynamics of the system , especially when the system - environment coupling is strong and when the acting environment can not be approximated by a markov bath @xcite . as far as we know ,",
    "there are no fully rigorous investigations of either correlated non - markovian environments or their effect on the entanglement of non - interacting qubit systems .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop a nonperturbative approach to studying the nonequilibrium quantum dynamics of an _ exactly solvable _ microscopic non - markovian spin - dissipation model .",
    "we will consider an open system consisting of two non - interacting qubits coupled to an environment formed by two baths that are correlated through interchanging quanta .",
    "our research can be considered as a unifying treatment of the earlier research involving a single common environment ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and two uncorrelated environments @xcite ) .",
    "correlated dynamics inevitably involves multi - scale quantum dissipation and quantum backaction induced by the strong system - bath interaction . for a class of super - radiation state ,",
    "we show that the bath - bath correlation will give rise to a crossover pattern exhibiting the competition between the bath memory parameter and the bath - bath coupling strength . also , we show an exotic entanglement evolution of the two uncoupled qubits purely induced by correlated baths , including sudden collapse and revival of entanglement in the ultrastrong correlation regime of baths .",
    "our nonperturbative quantum theory makes it feasible to study the non - markovian dynamics of two separated qubits driven by strongly correlated colored noises , providing a microscopic tool to understand the new physical effects induced by the bath correlation .",
    "the rest part of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we apply the bogoliubov transformation to obtain an exact qsd equation dealing with two central qubits coupled to two correlated baths . we calculate the inner - correlation dynamics of the two qubits in sec .",
    "[ dynamics ] to demonstrate the effect from the bath - bath correlation . in sec .",
    "[ discuss ] , we further discuss the application of the correlated baths on entangling two separated qubits . the conclusion is given in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "the details about the derivation of qsd equation can be found in appendix [ supp ] .",
    "our proposed model of two central qubits dissipatively coupled to two correlated baths respectively is given by ( setting @xmath0 ) @xmath1 where @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) is the coupling strength between qubit @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) and bath @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that ( i ) @xmath8 , where @xmath9 represents the anisotropy degree of the coupling parameter for the two qubits ; ( ii ) both baths @xmath6 and @xmath7 are supposed to be at zero temperature ; ( iii ) each @xmath10 is the correlation strength between resonant modes of the wave vector @xmath11 in two baths and the correlations between off - resonant modes are neglected . it should be noted that this model can capture main features of a more generic correlated bath .",
    "for instance , it can describe the quantum - dynamical behaviors of two separated atoms in two quantum cavities ( each in a cavity ) mutually coupled via an optical fiber @xcite . by using bogoliubov transformation , @xmath12",
    ", the original hamiltonian can be converted to the following form : @xmath13+{\\rm h.c .",

    "therefore , we have shown that the correlated baths can be mapped into two uncorrelated fictitious baths , each coupled to two qubits simultaneously .",
    "an important category of physical systems modeled by the above hamiltonian includes , e.g. , two capacitively coupled cooper - pair boxes under charge fluctuations , which can be converted to two uncorrelated qubits experiencing correlated noises @xcite with an analog qubit - bath interaction hamiltonian similar to eq .",
    "( [ htot ] ) .",
    "the coupling between the two physical baths @xmath6 and @xmath7 has been shifted into a modification to the frequencies in the new structured baths @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "it turns out that this transformation has paved a way of controlling the correlated dynamics through the parameter @xmath10 .",
    "note that when @xmath19 , i.e. , there is no direct interaction between the two baths , then the model simply reduces to the case with two separable baths @xcite .",
    "when @xmath20 ( the resonant condition as well as the ultrastrong correlation regime ) , the model reduces to another important limiting case representing just one common bath @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the exact linear qsd equation , a time - local convolutionless equation , describing quantum trajectories by the hamiltonian ( [ htot ] ) can be formally written as ( see appendix [ supp ] ) @xmath21 where the two coupling operators are @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , with @xmath25 explicitly given by @xmath26\\sigma^a_-\\sigma^b_- , \\quad x = a , b.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the initial conditions for these @xmath27-operators are @xmath28 . here",

    "it is important to note that @xmath35 is an _ arbitrary correlation function _ for bath @xmath36 .",
    "note that each @xmath27-operator explicitly contains the integrals over _ noises from both baths _ due to the fact that baths @xmath17 and @xmath18 are indirectly connected with each other through coupling to the system , a novel and important feature that does not emerge in the well - known cases with the local baths @xcite or the common bath @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is interesting to note that a set of partial differential equations for @xmath37 s ( noise - free terms ) and @xmath38 s ( noise - integral terms ) as well as their boundary conditions can be obtained by the qsd approach . to be more numerically efficient , the nonlinear qsd equation ( see appendix [ supp ] and ref .",
    "@xcite ) for the normalized states , @xmath39 , is employed in the following numerical simulations .",
    "to show the crossover behavior of nonequilibrium dynamics from the markov limit to the non - markovian regime , the spectral density functions of the physical baths @xmath6 and @xmath7 are assumed to be identical and of a lorentz form : @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the coupling strength between each qubit system and its bath , @xmath42 denotes the bandwidth of the bath , and @xmath43 is proportional to the bath memory time .",
    "the correlation function is obtained via fourier transform over @xmath44 , @xmath45 when @xmath42 approaches zero , the bath enters a very strong non - markovian regime , and typically causes a non - markovian system dynamics ; when @xmath42 becomes large or when time approaches infinity , @xmath46 , recovering the well - known markov limit . by definition , the correlation functions for the structured baths @xmath17 and @xmath18 are @xmath47 for simplicity , it is supposed that @xmath48 , where the dimensionless parameter @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) is used to measure the correlation strength between the physical baths . it is easy to check that when @xmath51 , @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 ; when @xmath56 , the correlation function of the _ effective _ common bath is @xmath57 .",
    "here we do not consider the case with @xmath58 .",
    "otherwise the system may become unphysical and lose its positivity .    with the nonlinear qsd equation ( [ nonli ] ) , the correlated gaussian noises @xmath34 and the time - evolution function for @xmath59",
    ", we can efficiently simulate the exact dynamics of the central qubit system by solving the qsd equation : @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "below we discuss the nonequilibrium quantum dynamics by examining the inner - correlation @xmath61 and entanglement @xmath62 measured by concurrence @xcite of the two - qubit system .",
    "the parameters are chosen as @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , ( corresponding to a strong coupling regime between qubits and baths ) , and the results are obtained by average over @xmath65 quantum trajectories , which are sufficient for the qsd equation to attain convergence for our model .     and positive bath - bath correlation strength ( blue solid line for @xmath66 , red dashed line for @xmath67 , and black dot - dashed line for @xmath68 ) . in ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , @xmath69 ; in ( d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) , @xmath70.,width=307 ]    in fig .",
    "[ plam ] , we observe the behavior of the inner - correlation between qubit @xmath4 and qubit @xmath5 along the @xmath36-direction , @xmath71 , describing a collective property relevant to the system coherence , with different initial entangled states , environment memory times and positive correlation strengths ( @xmath72 ) between the baths @xmath6 and @xmath7 . the system is initially prepared in the two - photon entangled state @xmath73 and the single - photon entangled state @xmath74 , respectively . in a strong non - markovian regime with @xmath75 , the system inner - correlation shows oscillations stronger in the two - photon entangled state than in the single - photon entangled state [ comparing figs .  [ plam](a ) and [ plam](d ) ] . for the two - photon entangled state ,",
    "a larger @xmath49 gives rise to a much stronger oscillations .",
    "but for the single - photon entangled state , the dynamical pattern induced by increasing @xmath49 is reversed . in a moderate range @xmath76 , for @xmath69",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ plam](b ) ] , only small bumps appear in the inner - correlation decay process when @xmath67",
    ". the resonant condition @xmath77 can extend the survival time of the inner - correlation . while for the state @xmath74 [ see fig .",
    "[ plam](e ) ] , the dynamics is almost @xmath49-independent .",
    "when @xmath78 , both baths are effectively in the markov regime , i.e. , the inner - correlation quickly decays into zero monotonously , irrespective of the initial states [ see figs .",
    "[ plam](c ) and [ plam](f ) ] .",
    "however , we notice that , as a rather counterintuitive result shown in fig .",
    "[ plam](f ) , the survival time of the inner - correlation in the resonant condition ( @xmath77 ) is longer than those in the off - resonant cases .",
    "it is because the two qubits experience an effective common bath at @xmath77 , and the single - photon state @xmath74 serves as a super - radiant state due to the coupling terms in eq .",
    "( [ htot ] ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , the effect of bath - bath correlations on system dynamics is _ state - dependent_.    to get a better picture of the nonequilibrium processes of the qubit system , it is useful to consider the markov limit of this correlated - baths model with the bath correlation functions @xmath79 , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "consequently , for @xmath82 , the lindblad master equation should be written as @xmath83+\\sum_{x = a , b}\\gamma_x\\mathcal{d}(l_x)$ ] , where @xmath84 , and for @xmath77 , @xmath85+\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\mathcal{d}(l_a)$ ] .",
    "considering the special initial state @xmath74 ( the eigenstate of @xmath86 ) , one can see that the damping rate of the system correlation is @xmath87 , which increases with decreasing @xmath49 and is larger than the damping rate @xmath88 for the @xmath89 case .",
    "therefore , in this situation , the @xmath90-influence on inner - correlation in markov limit [ see fig .  [ plam](f ) ] is opposite to that demonstrated in a highly non - markovian case [ see fig .  [ plam](d ) ] .",
    "this observation is helpful to understand the insensitivity of the dynamics to @xmath49 in the moderate non - markovian regime [ see fig .",
    "[ plam](e ) ] , where the crossover pattern reflects the tradeoff between the two competing elements : @xmath49 and @xmath42 .",
    "here @xmath91 and @xmath92.,width=307 ]    a prompt application of this study is to dynamically entangle two remote qubits . to focus exclusively on the effects on the entanglement generation of the qubits as it arises from the bath correlation , in fig .",
    "[ nlam ] , we keep @xmath93 ( a measurement of the memory capability for both baths ) unchanged , and tune the bath - bath correlation strength @xmath49 to display the entangling process of the two - qubit system that is initially prepared in the separable state @xmath91 . apart from the well - known ultrastrong correlation , i.e. , the effective common bath case with @xmath89",
    ", we show that the remote qubits can also be temporarily entangled purely via bath correlation in a wide parameter range .",
    "more specifically , for a weak bath correlation @xmath94 ( the blue solid curve in fig .",
    "[ nlam ] ) , the generated concurrence of the two - qubit system is present albeit small and has weak oscillations .",
    "when @xmath90 increases ( e.g. , @xmath95 ) , the generated concurrence becomes large and exhibits appreciable oscillations ( see the red dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ nlam ] ) .",
    "moreover , it can be seen that the concurrence at @xmath94 and @xmath96 tends to zero when @xmath97 .",
    "this is because the reduced density operator of the system approaches @xmath98 in the long - time limit for any @xmath99 .",
    "however when @xmath100 , which corresponds to the two qubits coupled to an effective common bath , the generated concurrence increases faster and then maintains at a given value of @xmath101 .",
    "the reason for the observed results is that the reduced density operator of the system approaches @xmath102 in the long - time limit for such a common - bath case , where @xmath103 is an eigenstate of @xmath104 , which is the only effective lindblad operator in the ultrastrong correlation case .     for generalized werner - state in the ultrastrong correlated bath .",
    "the red solid line corresponds to @xmath76 and the blue dashed line to @xmath78.,width=307 ]    next , we focus on the exotic behaviors of the quantum entanglement induced by the _",
    "ultrastrong _ bath correlation with @xmath100 which has not been nonperturbatively studied before .",
    "we choose a generalized werner - state as the initial state : @xmath105 , where @xmath106 , @xmath107 is the identity matrix in the hilbert space of the two - qubit system , and @xmath108 .",
    "it is known that the initial concurrence is @xmath109 . apparently , when @xmath110 , the two - qubit system is initially entangled . in this case",
    ", the system suffers a fast entanglement decay in a short time [ see fig .",
    "[ gere](a ) ] .",
    "moreover , the entanglement lifetime becomes significantly shortened when increasing the bath memory parameter @xmath93 , which means that _ the destructive effect on system entanglement from the markov bath is more serious than a comparatively non - markovian bath_. after a period of time , the entanglement suddenly revives due to the accumulation of correlation between the two baths . also , as shown in fig .",
    "[ gere](a ) , a larger @xmath93 yields an earlier revival of entanglement . this correlation - induced behavior is in sharp contrast to the usual observation that a non - markovian bath is helpful in enhancing the coherence refocusing of system compared with a markov bath .",
    "when @xmath111 , then the two qubits evolve from a separable mixed state . in this case , only the generation of the quantum entanglement occurs [ see fig .  [ gere](b ) ] . in the long - time limit , the reduced density operator of the system approaches @xmath112 , so @xmath113",
    "therefore , all of the curves in fig .",
    "[ gere ] will reach this value , implying that the steady state is irrelevant to @xmath93 .",
    "it turns out that the generated entanglement degree must be larger than its original value when @xmath114 .",
    "this provides a method to increase the quantum entanglement of two distant qubits via bath correlation rather than the qubit - qubit coupling or a common bath .",
    "we have presented here an investigation of the exact dynamical equation for two uncoupled qubits driven by strongly correlated noises . we have observed new physical phenomena arising from the bath - bath correlation .",
    "particularly , we have observed the crossover dynamics dictated by two competitive parameters of the bath memory capability @xmath115 and the bath - bath correlation strength @xmath90 .",
    "we have shown that the entanglement evolution of two qubits can be affected in several ways , depending on the initial states , environment memory time , and the bath - bath correlation .",
    "in particular , it is shown that the bath - bath correlation in a realistic context such as distant atoms in a quantum network can play a mediator role in generating entanglement of two remote qubits .",
