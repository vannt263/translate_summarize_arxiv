    "planetary ephemerides are used for multiple purposes including dynamical mass determination for solar system bodies , pulsar timing , high - precision tests of general relativity , and inter - planetary spacecraft navigation . during the past several decades a series of increasingly accurate ephemerides",
    "have been developed at the jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) by adding new data types such as very large array ( vla ) astrometry ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , spacecraft tracking @xcite , and radar range measurements @xcite to historical and modern optical observations .",
    "accurate ephemerides are one of the basic tools of observational astronomy , in the same sense as star catalogs and redshift surveys .",
    "they represent a community resource whose value is proportional to their accuracy , and whose accuracy requires regular observational support to maintain and improve .",
    "a specific example is the great improvement between timing distances and kinematic distances for pulsars when using the newer de405 ephemeris @xcite compared with the older de200 ephemeris ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "the orbits of the inner planets are very accurately tied together with the current data set .",
    "for example , the angular ephemeris errors for mars with respect to earth are typically 0.2 milli - arcsecond ( mas ) or 1 nrad @xcite",
    ". however , the outer planets are not as well tied to the inner planets ( or each other ) because there have been fewer opportunities to supplement optical observations with high precision spacecraft radio tracking data .",
    "the pioneer and voyager missions provided essentially single data points during their flybys of the outer planets , and the galileo mission to jupiter was severely constrained by the loss of its high gain antenna .",
    "this restricted galileo downlink signals to a relatively low frequency ( 2.3 ghz ) and a low signal / noise ratio . as a result , vlbi observations of galileo had accuracies of only @xmath05 - 10 mas @xcite .",
    "thus , the cassini mission to saturn ( http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/index.cfm ) is our first opportunity to incorporate high - accuracy data from a spacecraft orbiting an outer planet for an extended period .",
    "for reference , an angle of 0.1 mas ( 0.5 nrad ) corresponds to about 750 meters at the average distance of saturn from earth .",
    "our goal is to improve the position of saturn in the international celestial reference frame ( icrf , see @xcite ) through phase - referenced vlbi observations of cassini using the very long baseline array ( vlba ) at 8.4 ghz ( x band ) combined with cassini orbit determinations .",
    "the cassini orbit can be determined to about 2 km at apoapse and 0.1 km at periapse relative to the center of mass of saturn with range and doppler tracking by the deep space network @xcite .",
    "the future juno mission to jupiter should allow a similar application of phase - referenced vlbi to improve the jupiter ephemeris .",
    "combined with our new data for saturn this will lead to a better model for the gravitational interactions , and the orbital evolution , among all the outer planets . a covariance analysis @xcite at jpl shows that with only a few years of vlba data , the ephemeris improvement for saturn extends for decades .",
    "we have observed cassini with the vlba at eight epochs , each typically four hours long , during the past three years .",
    "table [ tab1 ] lists the dates of each epoch and the vlba antennas that were used .",
    "the vlba consists of ten radio antennas , each 25 meters in diameter , located at sites from the us virgin islands to hawaii .",
    "it has demonstrated an unrivaled astrometric precision of less than 10 micro - arcseconds ( @xmath1as ) in favorable circumstances ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the spacecraft s 8 ghz signals provide more than adequate snr as shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",

    "in addition , we observed several strong sources spread over the sky during each epoch to allow better calibration of the troposphere ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we did not attempt to improve the phase calibration by employing multiple phase reference sources when possible , as has been demonstrated by @xcite , but this is an option for future observations .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the projected baselines for one of our experiments ( bj061a ) .",
    "for some epochs , including this one , the most northerly vlba antenna site , in brewster , wa , was not able to participate .",
    "this caused a reduction in north - south resolution .",
    "nevertheless , the over - all baseline coverage is good for a low - declination radio source .",
    "it is sufficient for unambiguous phase referencing .    ]",
    "the accuracy of the icrf is approximately 0.02 mas , based on @xmath0200 defining sources each with a typical position error of 0.1 - 0.2 mas .",
    "individual sources may have larger errors at some epochs due to changes in source structure ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , but the imaging capability of the vlba allows us to detect and correct for such changes . to maximize the accuracy of our link between the saturn ephemeris and the icrf we have devoted a separate observing epoch to tying the phase reference sources to 10 - 20 high - quality icrf sources .",
    "( the results from this epoch will be reported separately . )",
    "this reduced our sensitivity to the structure of individual sources .",
    "we expect , based on previous experience with phase referenced vlbi ( e.g. , @xcite ) , that an absolute accuracy of 0.1 mas with respect to the icrf can be achieved for our calibration sources .",
    "thus , the final combined error of our cassini positions with respect to the icrf will be approximately 0.2 mas , consistent with the level of vlbi spacecraft tracking error predicted by @xcite .",
    "because the linking of our phase references sources to the grid of icrf sources is not complete , the current error for cassini positions in the icrf is estimated to be 0.3 mas or greater , depending on the specific phase reference source used .",
    "one of our phase reference sources has an icrf position error less than 0.1 mas , while some of the other reference sources have icrf positions errors several times larger .",
    "future observations to maintain and improve the icrf catalog will continue to reduce the position errors of these sources .",
    "calibration , editing , and other data reduction tasks were carried out using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "the only exception was the production of total delays for use by jpl software .",
    "this required a specific file format , which was created by combining information from aips output tables with a program written by e. fomalont .",
    "the analysis of data from a phase - referenced vlbi experiment involves multiple steps because there are many types of error that must be calibrated and removed from the data ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the following subsections describe these analysis steps .",
    "there are a number of constraints that must be satisfied when scheduling each epoch .",
    "these are :    1 .",
    "we need to avoid periods near saturn conjunction with the sun .",
    "2 .   cassini must be transmitting rate telemetry to the deep space network station at goldstone , ca , at x - band ( 8.4 ghz ) .",
    "3 .   we need to avoid spacecraft trajectory correction maneuvers , moon flybys , and ring occultations .",
    "4 .   we need a reasonably strong and compact phase reference source within about 2@xmath2 of cassini s position .",
    "5 .   we need to observe multiple strong sources covering a wide range of elevation angles for troposphere calibration during each epoch .",
    "because saturn reverses its apparent direction of motion on the sky every year , it is possible with careful scheduling to use the same phase reference source during multiple epochs .",
    "this reduces the number of phase reference sources that need to be tied to the icrf , and minimizes relative errors between epochs due to source structure or icrf offset differences between difference reference sources .",

    "there is often a tradeoff between angular separation and reference source flux density , and we did not consider sources with flux densities less than 100 mjy to ensure an adequate signal / noise ratio .",
    "in retrospect this flux density cutoff may have been too conservative .    during each observing epoch",
    "we alternated scans between cassini and the phase reference source every 2 - 3 minutes , and included occasional scans of a strong source for instrumental delay and bandpass calibration .",
    "in addition , @xmath5 strong sources covering as wide an elevation range as possible were observed during a 30 - 40 minute period to allow a zenith troposphere delay to be estimated for each of the vlba antenna sites .",
    "the data from each epoch were stored prior to correlation until a reconstructed orbit solution for cassini was available from jpl .",
    "the cassini orbit is determined from doppler tracking by the deep space network , and provides the _ a priori _ positions used for cassini during correlation . because cassini transmits in right circular polarization only , we used only the r - r corralator output in our analysis . to avoid decorrelation over time or frequency , and to accurately measure phase across the relatively narrow bandwidth of the cassini signal , we used 1-second integrations and 256 spectral channels across each 8-mhz if band .    the four available if bands were separated in frequency by up to 462 mhz to improve the multi - band delay response .",
    "small changes in the reference frequency were necessary at each epoch to keep the cassini signal away from the edges of if band 1 .",
    "( the frequency of the cassini signal changes by a few mhz when switching between a one - way downlink and a two - way coherent link . ) the center frequencies for each if band were approximately 8.428 , 8.500 , 8.790 , and 8.890 ghz .",
    "initial delays were calculated from the geometric model used during correlation @xcite . the _ a priori _ spacecraft position and proper motion at the start of our observations were corrected , if necessary , from the values used during correlation .",
    "( the most accurate cassini orbit solutions were not available until a few weeks after a particular date . )",
    "a subtle but important part of the geometric model is the difference in general relativity corrections for signals propagating through gravitational fields in the solar system , particularly those of the sun and saturn . unlike the phase reference sources",
    ", cassini can not be assumed to be at infinity ; only part of the solar system gravitational field applies to signals from cassini .",
    "amplitude calibration was based on recorded system temperatures along with previously determined antenna gain curves .",
    "additional amplitude corrections were applied to remove the effect of using two - bit quantization when recording signals at the vlba antennas .",
    "phases were corrected for parallactic angle and for improvements in the values of earth orientation parameters ( ut1 and polar motion ) .",
    "instrumental delay offsets were calibrated using either recorded phase calibration tones or by fringe fitting a strong calibration source and applying the resulting delay corrections to all scans .",
    "this aligned phases within the four 16-mhz - wide if bands .",
    "all data were examined for discrepant values or interference , and to verify that the _ a priori _ calibration had been applied correctly .",
    "our observations did not include very widely separated frequency bands , so the dispersive ionosphere delay ( and faraday rotation ) was calibrated using global maps of zenith total electron content ( tec ) determined from gps networks at two - hour intervals .",
    "linear interpolation between global tec maps bracketing an observation was used , including a longitude correction to account for the fact that the ionosphere should be approximately fixed with respect to the sun , not the earth .",
    "multi - band delays were calculated for a sample of @xmath6 strong sources observed in a rapid sequence over a wide range of elevation angles .",
    "a linear fit to the four if phases was used to determine the multi - band delay for each source .",
    "at least three ifs were required to have good data .",
    "zenith troposphere delays and clock errors ( offsets and rates ) were fit to the measured multi - band delays using the @xcite mapping function ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this calibration removed the residual tropospheric delay , thus aligning the phases between all four if bands .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the improvement in image quality produced by this manual troposphere delay calibration .",
    "note that the correction is mainly in the declination direction , as would be expected for a low declination source .",
    "the position offset is about 0.2 mas , corresponding to a difference in differential delay of a few mm on the longer vlba baselines .",
    "seven of the eight epochs reported in this paper were improved in this way .",
    "however , for one epoch ( bj061d ) all attempts to calibrate troposphere delays manually produced poorer results , and we relied on the basic correlator troposphere model for this epoch .",
    "a strong calibration source was observed during each epoch to determine any remaining antenna - based delays and to calibrate the bandpass response .",
    "after this step , scan - averaged phases were inspected for all calibration sources and baseline to verify that the phases were constant with frequency within and between if bands .",
    "self - calibration with a point source model was used to optimize the phases of the phase reference calibrator , and then these phases were applied to the cassini visibilities .",
    "no self - calibration was applied to the cassini data . at this state images",
    "were made of both the phase reference source and cassini .",
    "the phase reference source , by self - calibration , was always located at it s _ a priori _ sky position .",
    "we used the phase calibrator image to verify that a point source model was adequate .",
    "the location of the peak signal in the cassini image was measured with the aips task maxfit and used to shift the image to place cassini at ( or very near ) the phase center .",
    "two - dimensional quadratic fits to the peaks in images of cassini provide positions relative to the nominal phase center with formal errors under 0.02 mas in both coordinates , far smaller than our systematic errors .",
    "the post - shift baseline phases were examined to verify that the removal of the position offset had centered the cassini signal at the _ a prioir _ position .",
    "figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] show the unshifted images of cassini for all eight epochs .",
    "the first four epochs , in figure [ fig4 ] , all have large offsets from the phase center .",
    "this was caused by a one - second error in the time used when calculating the spacecraft position during correlation , the result of ignoring a leap second .",
    "this error was discovered in 2008 march , but re - correlation with a corrected correlator model was not possible because the raw data recordings were no longer available .",
    "the total delays were unaffected by this offset .",
    "the last four epochs , in figure [ fig5 ] , show much smaller position offsets after the leap second error was found and corrected .",
    "+     +      the position of the peak cassini signal was measured with respect to its image phase center , which in turn depended on the assumed position of the phase reference source and the geometric model .",
    "thus , any error in the phase reference source position produces a corresponding error in the position of cassini .",
    "we used the best available _ a priori _ positions for our phase reference sources during data analysis , but improved positions have recently become available as part of the icrf2 catalog @xcite .",

    "<S> we are carrying out a series of astrometric vlbi observations of the cassini spacecraft currently in orbit around saturn , using the very long baseline array ( vlba ) . </S>",
    "<S> these observations provide positions for the center of mass of saturn in the international celestial reference frame ( icrf ) with accuracies </S>",

    "<S> this paper reports results from eight observing epochs between 2006 october and 2009 april . </S>",
    "<S> these data are combined with two vlba observations by other investigators in 2004 and a cassini - based gravitational deflection measurement by fomalont et al . in 2009 to constrain a new ephemeris ( de 422 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the de 422 post - fit residuals for saturn with respect to the vlba data are generally 0.2 mas , but additional observations are needed to improve the positions of all of our phase reference sources to this level . over time we expect to be able to improve the accuracy of all three coordinates in the saturn ephemeris ( latitude , longitude , and range ) by a factor of at least three . </S>",
    "<S> this will represent a significant improvement not just in the saturn ephemeris but also in the link between the inner and outer solar system ephemeredes and in the link to the inertial icrf . </S>"
