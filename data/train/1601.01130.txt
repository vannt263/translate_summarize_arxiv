    "nowadays , one of the most important problem in galactic dynamics and cosmology concerns the so - called _ missing mass _ or _ dark matter _ ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , this mass would be responsible of the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies .",
    "the usual approach is to add a huge amount of invisible and unknown matter to solve the problem .",
    "however , having direct observational evidences of the presence and proof of the existence of such kind of matter is still a failure .",
    "another approach has been proposed in @xcite known as mond for modified newtonian dynamics .",
    "it consists in modifying newton s equation which is a linear relation between the force and the acceleration in a non - linear one when the acceleration is weak with respect to a constant fixed by the theory .",
    "up to a choice of functions in the theory , it well explains at the galactic level the behavior of the rotation curves ( see e.g. @xcite with references therein for a review of the best formulation of mond at the non - relativistic level with a modified poisson equation ) . in both cases ,",
    "it can be seen as adding a potential of matter or modifying the initial potential . + in our recent work @xcite , we developed a mathematical formalism to take into account _",
    "scale formulation of dynamical systems_. when modeling a dynamical system , the notion of _ scale _ naturally occurs at different levels .",
    "for example , taking into account the notion of scale can be of dynamical origin as in fluid dynamics or geometric as in the study of certain fractal objects .",
    "more generally , this concept appears when attempting to characterize the nature of a trajectory .",
    "indeed , for example in mechanics , a finite set of observational data is limited by a scale resolution . from this problem",
    ", we developed the formalism of _ scale dynamics _ which allows taking into account dynamical effects induced by the nature of the observed behavior .",
    "to illustrate this formalism , we have shown that the newton equation and the schrdinger equation were equivalent assuming that the nature of the trajectories was fractional .",
    "this is the case for typical trajectories in quantum mechanics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this approach is different from the usual one in classical mechanics .",
    "indeed , from our point of view , classical mechanics is formulated assuming a linear scale regime , i.e. the asymptotic models has a differentiable motion . such an approach to change the scale regime",
    "can be used to think about a new possible explanation of the problem of dark matter , and by consequent , to the mond theory , using scale dynamics .",
    "this idea is supported by the work of l. nottale on _ scale relativity_. indeed , he used the notion of _ fractal space - time _ to show that the constant velocity curves in galaxies can be explained by the _ fractal behavior _ of the dynamics ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in this paper",
    ", we propose to apply our formalism to mechanics to show that the scale formulation of the newton equation exhibit dynamical effects induced by the scale regime observed or chosen .",
    "these supplementary dynamical terms can be interpret as a modification or an addition of potentials .",
    "moreover , applying it to the two body problem , with a particular fractional scale regime , we recover the result obtained by l. nottale , i.e. the velocity of the orbiting body is constant",
    ". + the plan of the paper is as follows : + in section [ reminder ] , we remind the basic tools from scale dynamics concerning the asymptotic formulation of models and operators under a particular scale regime . in section [ asymptotic ] , we develop the main equations of this paper from the scale formulation of newton s equation .",
    "particularly , under a fractional scale regime , we obtain a fractional hamilton - jacobi equation and a fractional version of the virial theorem . in section [ kepler ] , we apply the development in the previous section on the two - body problems and we show that the velocity of the orbiting body tend to be constant . +",
    "we remind in this section the basis of scale dynamics about the asymptotic models and operators constructed from the scale formulation and definitions of objects . the definition",
    "are directly extended to @xmath0 . for complete details ,",
    "we refer to our paper @xcite .",
    "+ the construction of asymptotic models and differential operators are based from the global behavior observed of a phenomenon at different scale , i.e. the observed scale regime . from this",
    ", one can assume that on this scale range , the asymptotic behavior will be the same .",
    "doing so , one can obtain the construction of an asymptotic model representing the phenomenon at the continuous level in a _",
    "regular part _ and a _ deviant part _ which contains the information on the observed behavior .",
    "for example , observing a linear scale regime on a specific scale range , one can construct an asymptotic continuous model which will be , from the definition of a linear scale regime , differentiable . in consequence ,",
    "the deviant part will be zero .",
    "but , observing a fractional scale regime , one can construct an asymptotic model which will have by definition , a non zero deviant part . for any asymptotic model @xmath1",
    ", we denote @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the regular part of @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the deviant part of @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath7 derivatives are respectively defined for any asymptotic models @xmath4 as @xmath8 in fact , the operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 extract the right and left derivatives of the regular part of @xmath9 .",
    "we are interested in asymptotic models which are not differentiable , i.e. asymptotic models which are not obtained with a linear scale regime . the `` first simple '' class of such models is characterized by the comparison class @xmath10 the class @xmath11 defines the fractional scale behavior .",

    "this equation can be seen as a result of a scale formulation with a linear scale regime , i.e. the asymptotic behavior is differentiable .",
    "we now consider the scale formulation of the newton equation under a fractional scale regime .",
    "the asymptotic newton s equation associated is given by ( see @xcite ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "as there is no confusion possible with _ scale functions _ introduced in @xcite , for notation convenience , we remove the @xmath36 sign on @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    ", we can decompose the action functional @xmath43 in two parts @xmath48 as follows @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "now , identifying the real and the imaginary parts of the asymptotic fractional hamilton - jacobi equation , we obtain    let @xmath52",
    ". the real and imaginary parts of the asymptotic fractional hamilton - jacobi equation are respectively given by @xmath53    in the linear scale regime case , i.e. @xmath54 for all @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the system of equations reduces to the usual hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath57 where the hamiltonian @xmath58 associated to the action functional @xmath59 is defined as @xmath60 . in the fractional scale regime",
    "it defines a two dimensional hamiltonian @xmath61 as @xmath62 as we can see , the first component of this two dimensional hamiltonian can be seen as _ adding _ extra terms to the hamiltonian of the linear scale regime @xmath58 . knowing the solution of @xmath63 , it can be interpreted as a _ modification _ or _",
    "an addition _ of the potential @xmath30 .",
    "this is exactly the motivation of using the framework of _ scale dynamics _ which induces naturally dynamical effects depending on the scale regime .",
    "+ in order to illustrate our formalism and to apply it to mechanics , we made the following assumptions on the fractional scale regime :    [ assum1 ] the fractional scale regime is of order @xmath64 , i.e. @xmath65 .    the fractional scale regime is uniform and has independent components , i.e. for all @xmath66 and @xmath67 we have @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the kronecker delta .",
    "it follows that @xmath70 with @xmath71    in consequence , we obtain the following lemma :    under assumptions i and ii , the asymptotic fractional hamilton - jacobi equation of order @xmath72 associated to the action functional @xmath43 is given by @xmath73 and its real and imaginary parts are given by @xmath74    in classical mechanics , an important relation can be derived from the newton equation which is known as the _",

    "in order to obtain @xmath63 to have the induced dynamical effects from the scale regime on the classical motion , a way to solve analytically the asymptotic fractional hamilton - jacobi equation or the system , is to use the following change of variable : @xmath81 with @xmath82 a real constant .",
    "it follows that @xmath83 . using the same kind of computations as in @xcite , from the asymptotic fractional hamilton - jacobi equation ,",
    "we obtain the following partial differential equation satisfied by @xmath84 : @xmath85 which is the _ non - linear schrdinger equation_. a convenient way to write the function @xmath84 is to consider the positive defined function @xmath86 as @xmath87 . in that case",
    ", we have @xmath88 and from this definition , we obtain the following lemma :    considering the change of variable with @xmath87 , the asymptotic fractional hamilton - jacobi equation is equivalent to @xmath89    the proof is given in appendix [ dem_hj - system3 ] . + from the previous derivation , we have a general formulation of the asymptotic newton equation through the asymptotic fractional hamilton - jacobi equation and the schrdinger equation under assumptions i and ii . in order to solve the non - linear schrdinger equation for the kepler problem in the next section ,",
    "we make a last assumption on the fractional scale regime :    the fractional scale regime is uniform over time derivatives , i.e. @xmath90 .",

    ", the potential @xmath30 is a homogeneous function or order @xmath101 and is given by the well - known relation @xmath102 with @xmath103 , @xmath104 is the universal constant of gravitation and @xmath105 is the distance between the two bodies at each instant . + in order to solve the schrdinger equations and , we use the separation variable method .",
    "indeed , we look for function @xmath84 as @xmath106 with @xmath107 , @xmath108 the total energy of the system and @xmath109 is a function depending only on the position . in consequence ,",

    "+    we expected to obtain the same extra potential in the two cases .",
    "indeed , the non - linearity is linked to the choice of the constant @xmath82 .",
    "this constant could not be independent of the problem and induces a dynamical effect because it would add an arbitrary degree of freedom . even if , in the change of variable with the @xmath84 function , @xmath82 could be chosen arbitrary , the contribution of the non - linearity related to @xmath82 and its arbitrary choice is destroyed in the asymptotic fractional hamilton - jacobi .    in order to obtain of the velocity of the orbiting body , we use our derivation of the generalized virial theorem .",
    "the real part of equation is equivalent to @xmath131 in consequence , we obtain @xmath132 which means that the velocity of the orbiting body is constant ( see figure [ velocity_curve ] for an illustration with @xmath133 and @xmath134 ) .    in this particular case of fractional scale regime , we recover rigorously the result obtained in @xcite .",
    "such a situation of keplerian motion would appear in the outer region of a galaxy .",
    "it would explain the observed constant velocity in spiral galaxies far away from its galactic center . in consequence , modifying the law of gravitation as in mond theory would only result in interpolating the supplementary terms appearing due to the scale formulation of newton s equation , which is in that case , a scale formulation with a fractional scale regime .",
    "in this paper , we showed that the scale dynamical formulation of newton s equation generates supplementary dynamical terms which could be interpret as a modification of the potential , as in mond theory , or an addition of an extra potential , as it is done with dark matter .",
    "moreover , it is supported by the intriguing fact that when considering our approach for the two body problem , it shows that the velocity of the orbiting body tends to be a constant , as it is observed for the flat rotation curves of galaxies .",
    "one has to notice that more complicated scale regime can be chosen such as logarithmic comparison scale or hardy comparison scale ( see @xcite ) but as we can see , choosing the fractional scale regime of order @xmath135 already leads to a probable explanation of strange effects such as the dark matter .",
