    "synchronization is an important feature of swarms of fireflies @xcite , pedestrians on a footbridge @xcite , systems of josephson junctions @xcite , the power grid @xcite , oscillatory chemical reactions @xcite and cells in the heart and brain @xcite . since the pioneering work of winfree @xcite and kuramoto @xcite , mathematical models of arrays of coupled oscillators have been used to gain insight into the origin of spontaneous synchronization in a variety of different settings @xcite .",
    "in addition to uniform synchronous and asynchronous oscillation , many networks of oscillators are known to exhibit a type of partial synchronization known as a `` chimera '' state @xcite .",
    "chimera states are spatio - temporal patterns in which regions of coherence and incoherence coexist @xcite .",
    "these patterns have been reported in analysis and simulation of coupled oscillators with a variety of network topologies @xcite and appear to be robust to a variety of perturbations @xcite .",
    "recently , they were also observed in experiments with optical @xcite , chemical @xcite , mechanical @xcite and electrochemical oscillators @xcite .",
    "they bear a strong resemblence to patterns of electrical activity in the human brain @xcite .    when they coined the term `` chimera '' state , abrams and strogatz defined it as a state in which an array of identical oscillators splits into domains of synchonized and desynchronized oscillation .",
    "recently ashwin et al .",
    "formalised this idea into a definition of a `` weak chimera '' @xcite such that one can prove the existence of , and investigate the stability and bifurcation of chimera - like solutions in small networks . for our purposes",
    ", we will use the term `` chimera state '' to refer to a trajectory in which two or more oscillators are synchronized ( in phase and frequency ) and one or more oscillators drift in phase and frequency with respect to the synchronized group ; these are weak chimeras with the additional restriction of phase synchronization",
    ".    in nature oscillators often experience non - local interactions with other oscillators that promote synchronization .",
    "it is natural to model the dynamics on these networks using finite systems of differential equations . in models like the kuramoto model",
    ", fully synchronized states can be understood as stationary solutions in a rotating frame of reference .",
    "unfortunately , chimera states and other partially synchronized solutions are more difficult to characterize due to fluctuations in the local degree of synchrony , which is measured by an order parameter . as a result , until recently @xcite , little progress has been made in analyzing chimera states for finite networks .    instead , theoretical investigations of chimera states often replace a finite network of oscillators ( discrete ) with an infinite network ( continuum )  @xcite . in the continuum limit , the order parameter is stationary for a variety of synchronized and desynchronized solutions , including chimera states .",
    "this makes it possible to characterize chimera states by solving an eigenvalue problem .",
    "unfortunately , rigorous analysis of the detailed dynamics and stability of chimera states remains difficult , even in the continuum limit ( it is possible in certain lower dimensional cases @xcite ) .",
    "so , researchers typically discretize the theoretical solutions from the continuum limit and assess the stability using numerical simulations with large ensembles of oscillators .",
    "the implicit assumption is that these two systems , one with an infinite number of oscillators and the other with a finite number , should behave in similar ways .",
    "however , at this time there is no rigorous justification for why this would need to be the case . although there is evidence that this holds for certain coupling schemes @xcite , there are cases where chimera states are stable in the continuum limit but not when the number of oscillators is finite . for example ,",
    "wolfrum and omelchenko  @xcite study a ring of oscillators with phases @xmath2 described by @xmath3 for @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of oscillators . for finite @xmath5 , and @xmath6 proportional to @xmath5 they show that chimera states are not attracting , but instead appear as chaotic transients .",
    "this means one can observe a period of chimera - like behavior for certain initial conditions but the duration of this period is finite . in large systems ( @xmath7 ) the observation of the collapse of a chimera in simulation is extremely rare , but in small networks ( @xmath8 ) the lifetime can be quite short .",
    "it is unknown to what degree these observations apply to other topologies .    here",
    "we explore a simple network with two groups of oscillators .",
    "we show that in this network , the analogues of chimera states need not be transients  they exist as stable periodic orbits with as few as two oscillators per group .",

    "let @xmath16 and @xmath17 represent the phases of oscillators in groups 1 and 2 respectively .",

    ", they use the ott / antonsen ansatz  @xcite to derive a set of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) satisfied by the complex order parameters for the two groups of oscillators ( which measure the degree of synchrony within each group ) .",
    "a chimera state in our sense corresponds to one group being perfectly synchronized ( so that the magnitude of its order parameter @xmath24 is equal to @xmath25 ) while oscillators in the other group are asynchronous ( so that magnitude of its order parameter satisfies @xmath26 ) . in this case , abrams et al .",

    "increasing @xmath20 further results in this solution colliding with the saddle chimera in a homoclinic bifurcation , and no stable chimeras remain .      generating initial conditions consistent with the stationary chimera in the continuum limit for varying @xmath5 we obtain the trajectories for order parameter @xmath27 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajna ] . when @xmath5 is small",

    "for chimera states to be observable they must be robust with respect to hetereogeneity .",
    "previous investigations have shown that they are robust with respect to non - identical frequencies  @xcite ( in the continuum limit ) and removal of connections within a large but finite network  @xcite .",
    "the derivation of many of the equations in this paper has relied upon the oscillators having identical intrinsic frequencies , but we have verified numerically that the stable chimera states found here do persist when the intrinsic frequencies are randomly chosen from distributions with sufficiently small variances , for all @xmath139 ( results not shown ) .    another question that arises is whether these results can be extended to networks of oscillators which are not described by just a phase variable .",

    "so the synchronized manifold is always stable for @xmath162 , or @xmath163 in practice , however @xmath164 remains close to 0 in a chimera state , so the synchronous group is stable to a variety of perturbations provided @xmath165 is not too small .",
