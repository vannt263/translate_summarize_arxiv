    "historically , when technology allows a wavelength regime to be newly probed , either in terms of sensitivity or area , one of the first tasks is a large , shallow survey to see what astrophysical phenomena lurk in the uncovered territory . in recent years , major advances from this line of research include the discovery of the coolest galactic stars by the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , ultraluminous infrared galaxies by the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ , the most distant quasars by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , and the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background , first by the _ cosmic background explorer _ and later refined by the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe_. such fundamental scientific discoveries have been a major incentive and reward for nasa s explorer program and other large projects .",

    "the former , of course , are not actually rare in the cosmos ; their faint optical magnitudes merely delayed their discovery until recent years and continue to make them `` rare '' in terms of known , spectroscopically - confirmed examples .",

    "we approximate high - redshift quasar spectra as step functions , with zero flux below redshifted ly@xmath41 and a flat sed ( in @xmath42 ) redward of ly@xmath41 , and we approximate the ndwfs @xmath17-band filter as a tophat function .",
    "our selection criteria restrict our sensitivity to quasars at @xmath104 .",
    "the lower redshift limit comes from the @xmath47 color requirement , determined from the richards et  al .",

    "this prediction exactly matches the current results , though , notably , the faintest of the high - redshift botes quasars has @xmath108 , suggesting that more quasars remain to be discovered with @xmath109 and that the faint end slope of the high - redshift quasar luminosity function is steeper than currently assumed .",
    "of the 3.3 quasars predicted at @xmath107 , only 0.3 are expected to be at @xmath31 , or , for 12%  of quasars being radio - loud ( stern et  al . 2000 ) , we only had a 4%  chance of identifying a @xmath31 radio - loud quasar in this survey . while it is premature to make strong claims from this small sample , our results imply possible rapid evolution in the faint end of the quasar luminosity function and in the radio loud fraction at high redshift .",
    "we report the discovery of the first mid - infrared selected field brown dwarf and the discovery of the most distant radio loud source known . fig .",
    "[ fig.sed ] plots the observed seds of these two sources , with a model brown dwarf spectrum from burrows , sudarsky , & hubeny ( 2006 ) and a model high - redshift quasar from richards et  al .",
    "interestingly , despite nine orders of magnitude difference in luminosity distance , or nearly 20 orders of magnitude difference in luminosity , the broad - band optical colors , the broad - band mid - infrared colors , and the multi - wavelength brightnesses of these two extremely disparate sources are nearly identical . with only @xmath10 and irac photometry , there is no possibility to separate mid - t brown dwarfs and high - redshift quasars . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.colnearir ] , however , near - infrared photometry offers the possibility to separate the two source types .",
    "while quasars have red @xmath110 colors , the latest t dwarfs have blue near - infrared colors , @xmath111 .",
    "we have presented simple color criteria which very efficiently identify astrophysically interesting sources .",
    "using the botes @xmath53m - selected catalog , the criteria presented in  3 identify 30 potential candidates which were trimmed down to four robust candidates after visual inspection .",
    "the primary weakness of the criteria is that we have only found objects at the edge of current observations , not beyond them ",
    "e.g. ,  is the among the 50 coldest brown dwarfs known and  is the 6th most distant quasar known . to push to new territory",
    "such as y dwarfs and @xmath43 quasars will require modifying the selection criteria in  3 , and , most likely , surveying more of the celestial sphere . in our current search ,",
    "the @xmath112 criterion imposed to ensure robust morphological selection of unresolved sources is the most restrictive requirement .",
    "probing deeper would allow the detection of fainter sources , but to identify y dwarfs and @xmath43 quasars will likely require robust morphological information at longer wavelengths .",
    "we consider the effects of relaxing the selection criteria identified in  3 .",
    "if we retain the requirement @xmath112 but drop the morphological requirement for a point source , we obtain 434 candidates . going a magnitude more deeply in @xmath17-band , where ndwfs photometry is still robust but star - galaxy morphological separation fails , nearly quadruples the number of candidates to 1598 sources .",
    "galaxies at @xmath113 have red @xmath114 colors and irac [ 3.6 ] @xmath30 [ 4.5 ] @xmath115 ( see model tracks in stern et  al .",
    "2005 ) , thereby causing significant contamination . at @xmath116",
    ", quasars will fall out of the ndwfs @xmath17-band , so one might think that selecting optical dropouts with irac [ 3.6 ] @xmath30 [ 4.5 ] @xmath115 would provide efficient criteria to identify the most distant quasars .",
    "unfortunately , red galaxies are again a contaminant : there are nearly 10,000 sources in the botes field with [ 3.6 ] @xmath30 [ 4.5 ] @xmath115 and no detection in the optical passbands .",
    "we are currently experimenting with various schemes to trim these large samples that arise when morphological criteria are nt available .",
    "one possibility , amenable to searching for cool dwarfs , is to search for sources with blue near - infrared colors ( e.g. , @xmath117 ) , but red colors in [ 3.6 ] @xmath30 [ 4.5 ]",
    ". the former criterion should identify both hot and cold galactic stars , while the latter criterion eliminates the hot stars . since extragalactic sources are typically redder in @xmath110 ( e.g. , fig .  7 in elston",
    "2006 ) , these criteria should identify t dwarfs ( and colder ) irrespective of morphology .",
    "another solution would be to obtain better morphological measurements , as are available in the ( smaller area ) extended groth strip and the cosmos surveys , or should also be obtainable with the new generation of wide - field , near - infrared cameras .",
    "our observations illustrate some of the interesting sources identifiable from wide - area mid - infrared surveys . after _",
    "spitzer _ has depleted its cryogen , expected to occur in early- to mid-2009 , wide - area 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath27 m surveys are likely to be an emphasis for the observatory .",
    "shortly thereafter , the launch of the _ wise _ will provide full - sky , mid - infrared images .",
    "such surveys , combined with the deep , complementary optical data expected from the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( pan - starrs ; kaiser et  al .",
    "2005 ) and the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; tyson et  al .",
    "2005 ) , should prove very valuable for studying both the nearest , coldest stars and for identifying the most distant , luminous quasars .",
    "the former will enhance our knowledge of star formation and galactic structure .",
    "the latter will probe the first cosmic structures , the history of the intergalactic medium , and literally expand the limits of human knowledge .",
