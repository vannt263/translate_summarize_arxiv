    "the excited state molecular wavepacket is projected onto different electronic continua by an ionization pulse .",
    "the energy flow in a molecule after photoexcitation can be followed in time as transient changees in the intensity and energy of photoelectron ( pe ) peaks . in order to access the excited state dynamics",
    ", the probe photon energy has to exceed the excited state ionization potential .",

    "has allowed the separation of nuclear relaxation from electronic relaxation by applying koopmans single electron propensity rules  @xcite .",
    "probe pulses are generally obtained by crystal based nonlinear optics , limiting the probe pulse photon energy to @xmath6ev .",
    "those probe photon energies barely ionize the excited state , and nuclear relaxation due to intramolecular vibrational redistribution ( ivr ) and geometrical relaxation results in an immediate decrease of the signal due to a loss of franck - condon overlap",
    ". electronic relaxation due to non - adiabatic transitions  @xcite will also result in a decay of the photoelectron signal due to a ) changing dipole matrix elements and b ) further nuclear relaxation in a different electronic state .",
    "in general , it is difficult to separate nuclear from electronic relaxation with low photon energy probe pulses , since both processes lead to similar decay patterns .",
    "in addition , this method can not follow further molecular dynamics after the initial decay processes , since the ability for probing is lost .",
    "strong field multi - photon ionization provides the opportunity to ionize from excited states and from the ground state .",
    "however , its interpretation requires extensive strong field ionization calculations  @xcite and may be further complicated by transient shifts of intermediate resonances .",
    "vacuum ultraviolet ( vuv ) probe photons , on the other side , have large enough photon energies to follow relaxation of the excited non - equilibrium state all the way to the vibrationally hot ground state .",
    "paired with the short pulse characteristics obtained with high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) , they are advantageous as probe pulses in trpes .",
    "a difficulty that arises with probing in the vacuum ultraviolet and extreme ultaviolet range is a persistent background pe signal from the ( unexcited ) electronic ground state .",
    "this requires a high signal to noise ratio to isolate excited state dynamics .",

    "the electrons can recombine with the remaining ion and their kinetic energy is converted into photon energy  @xcite , resulting in the emission of a comb of odd numbered harmonics of the fundamental laser frequency .",
    "femtosecond vuv pulses can also be obtained from free electron lasers at high fluences but also high costs  @xcite .    to perform pe spectroscopy , a single harmonic",
    "is usually selected from the hhg spectrum by monochromizing beamlines using gratings  @xcite or multilayer mirrors  @xcite .",
    "grating monochromators even allow a bandwidth reduction below the inherent width of the respective harmonic at the cost of photon flux  @xcite .",
    "pulse broadening in the time domain due to pulse front tilting of diffracted pulses can be corrected with time compensated dual grating setups  @xcite preserving the pulse duration of high - order harmonics which is much shorter than that of the driving pulse  @xcite . however , these setups reduce the beamline transmission and increase the alignment effort of the setup .",
    "multilayer mirrors are tailored to reflect a single harmonic .",
    "other harmonics are reflected as well , albeit with reduced efficiency , due to a finite bandwidth and finite specular reflectivity of the materials used . a combination of two multilayer mirrors allows to reduce the reflection of undesired harmonics to as low as @xmath9%  @xcite .",
    "vuv pulse durations around 10fs and below achieved with both grating  @xcite and multilayer  @xcite monochromatization have been reported .    here",
    "we present a very simple and cost efficient way to select a single harmonic as pump or probe pulse for trpes with vuv light .",
    "we exploit the bandpass structure in transmission of a 150 nm thick indium ( in ) metal filter which is centered at harmonic nine ( h9 , 89 nm , 14ev ) of a 800 nm fundamental . in combination with a focusing optic ( mgf@xmath10 protected al , or unprotected au mirror ) the transmission contrast is @xmath11 to higher harmonics and @xmath12 to lower harmonics . we expect negligible temporal broadening of the vuv pulse , as it is the case with multi layer mirrors  @xcite or time - delay compensated monochromators  @xcite . while the photon energy of h9 is sufficient to ionize many molecules from the ground state it has also the advantage of a higher conversion efficiency in the hhg process because it is closer to the perturbative region  @xcite .",
    "vuv light was used in gas phase trpes as a probe pulse to study molecular dynamics of valence electronic states such as the dissociation of br@xmath10 upon 400 nm excitation to the lowest dissociative state  @xcite .",
    "the vuv light can also be used to excite a system to rydberg states which are transiently ionized by visible or uv pulses  @xcite .",
    "time - resolved dynamical studies in cationic states , for example in ethylene , have also become possible with vuv pump excitation and ir  @xcite or vuv  @xcite probe .    in the following",
    "we describe the pump - probe setup , in particular how harmonic 9 is spectrally isolated from the harmonic spectrum ( experimental setup ) .",
    "the probe path of our setup allows for changing from vuv to the 800 nm fundamental without alteration of the pump - probe delay and without need for realignment , simply by removing the in filter and deactivating hhg .",
    "this is useful for alignment purposes but , more importantly , also enables multi - photon ionization as a complementary ionization mechanism .",
    "direct comparison of vuv single - photon probing with multi - photon 800 nm ionization is thus possible .",
    "we use a time - of - flight ( tof ) spectrometer to record mass spectra for multi - photon probe which is also described in the experimental setup . for h9 single - photon probe",
    "we detect the electron kinetic energy and operate the tof spectrometer as magnetic bottle spectrometer to benefit from the higher collection efficiency .",

    "a 400 nm pulse energy of 650nj ( @xmath76w/@xmath8 ) turned out to be a good compromise ( we estimate that about 17% of the molecules are excited , assuming a 64 mb excitation cross section @xcite ) . at these laser intensities",
    "the pump pulse alone produces a relatively large amount of photoelectrons ( fig .",
    "[ fig:400h9electrons1]b , black dotted curve ) , probably because of resonant enhancement of the two photon transition from s@xmath3 into the continuum . to decrease the load of our mcp detectors",

    "the energy of the emerging bands is consistent with excitation by the 3ev ( 400 nm ) pump pulse .",
    "consequently , a transfer of population from s@xmath60 to s@xmath3 reduces the pe signal originating from s@xmath60 resulting in a negative difference signal .",
    "this is directly evident for the two highest energy peaks at 5.1ev and 7.0ev , which shift to 8.2ev and 10.1ev , respectively ( corresponding energy regions are marked with vertical dashed and solid lines in fig .",

    "a simple and cost efficient way has been presented to isolate the @xmath0 harmonic of a 800 nm fundamental from the harmonic spectrum by means of an in metal filter in combination with a normal incidence mgf@xmath10 coated al mirror .",
    "the probe photon energy of 14ev allows to address the whole set of valence electron levels in many molecules . due to the fact that the probe pulse also ionizes the ground state , difference spectra between reversed time delays",
    "are used to infer molecular transients .",
    "the h9 pulse duration of @xmath5fs has been obtained from cross correlation measurements on perylene molecules .",
    "this is longer than expected , most probably due to a fundamental pulse chirp that serves to optimize the spectral bandwidth and intensity of the vuv probe pulse .    in future experiments , electronic relaxation in molecules with non - adiabatic transitions",
    "can be followed all the way to the ( vibrationally hot ) electronic ground state .",
    "the high photon energy allows mapping of excited states onto a larger domain of the continuum , as compared to crystal - based harmonic probes .",
    "this increases the ability to disentangle electronic from vibrational dynamics for internal conversion between neutral excited states with different koopmans - type correlations to ionic states .",
    "in addition to vuv single - photon probe , 800 nm multi - photon probe can easily be achieved with our setup , without influencing the beam geometry or pump - probe delay . in multi - photon ionization , which is often used in time - resolved studies , neutral excited molecular states might interfere with the probe scheme and thereby obscure the genuine relaxation dynamics .",
    "direct comparison of the two probe schemes will reveal the influence of such intermediate resonances and thereby provide valuable information about excited state dynamics during the relaxation process .",
