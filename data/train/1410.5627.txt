    "the reader should note that this is an identical copy of an article first published in  @xcite .",
    "beam effects have limited the performance of previous and existing hadron colliders  @xcite such as the isr  @xcite , sp@xmath0s  @xcite , tevatron  @xcite and rhic  @xcite , and are also expected to limit the performance of the lhc  @xcite .",
    "beam  beam effects can be categorized as either incoherent ( dynamic aperture and beam lifetime ) , pacman ( bunch - to - bunch variations ) , or coherent ( beam oscillations and instabilities )  @xcite .",
    "these effects can be caused by both head - on and long - range interactions .",
    "head - on effects , leading to tune shifts and spreads , are important in all hadron colliders .",
    "total beam  beam induced tune shifts as large as 0.028 were achieved in the sp@xmath0s  @xcite and tevatron  @xcite , although operational tune shift values are somewhat lower .",
    "the lhc in its early stages of commissioning has already reached a total head - on beam  beam tune shift of 0.02  @xcite .",
    "long - range effects , however , differ in previous and existing colliders . in the isr the beams collided under a large crossing angle of 15  deg  @xcite that greatly reduced long - range effects . in the sp@xmath0s , with both beams in the same aperture and only three bunches per beam",
    ", there were a few long - range interactions distributed over the ring circumference . due to the difference in the bunch intensities , the effect on the anti - protons was stronger . in the tevatron , also with both beams in the same aperture but 36 bunches per beam , there are more long - range interactions . with increased intensity of the anti - proton bunches , protons can also be affected .    in rhic ( fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] ) , where both beams share the same aperture only in the interaction regions , there is only one long - range interaction per interaction region without an experiment ( a total of four in the current configuration ) , with a 10  mm separation ( corresponding to 30 rms beam sizes for protons at 250  gev energy ) .",
    "long - range interactions have affected the rhic ramp transmission in the past  @xcite .",
    "in the lhc there are 32 long - range beam  beam interactions localized in each of four interaction regions  @xcite .",
    "a major upgrade of the lhc interactions region is foreseen by the end of the decade with the primary objective to increase the average luminosity of the machine by about a factor of 5 to 10 above the design performance . among the various upgrade scenarios a crab crossing scheme ( cc ) , an early beam separation scheme ( es ) , and a large piwinski angle ( lpa )",
    "are considered . in the cc scheme , crab cavities placed on either side of the interaction region",
    "impart a transverse kick to effectively compensate the crossing angle .",
    "this scheme allows for a large crossing angle that greatly reduces long - range beam  beam effects . in the es scheme  @xcite the number of long - range interactions is greatly reduced but four parasitic collisions at 45  @xmath1 per ip remain . in the lpa scheme  @xcite the small crossing angle will be maintained , and long bunches of intensities up to @xmath2@xmath3 protons are used .",
    "all schemes aim at higher than nominal bunch currents and reduced @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , long - range effects tend to become more problematic and require more aperture for larger crossing angles or compensation to mitigate these effects .",
    "the lpa scheme would most benefit from long - range beam  beam compensation .",
    "the compensation of long - range effects in the tevatron was proposed with electron lenses  @xcite , and in the lhc with wires  @xcite .",
    "electron lenses were also considered for the lhc  @xcite , and the use of wires was also studied for the tevatron  @xcite .",
    "implementation of long - range beam  beam compensation in the tevatron is challenging because the effect is distributed over the whole ring . in the lhc",
    "the effect is localized in the interaction regions .",
    "a partial long - range beam  beam compensation was successfully implemented in the @xmath5 collider da@xmath6ne  @xcite .",
    "beam compensation and related issues were reviewed at a workshop in 2007  @xcite .",
    "figures  [ fig:01 ] and [ fig:02 ] show the basic layout of the beam  beam interaction and compensation studies in rhic . at store",
    "there are nominally two head - on interactions in points 6 and 8 ( ip6 and ip8 ) , and long - range interactions with a large separation in the other interaction points .",
    "three bunches in the blue ring are coupled to three bunches in the yellow ring through the head - on beam  beam interaction . for studies ,",
    "two dc wires were installed in the blue and yellow rings respectively in interaction region 6 ( ir6 ) .",
    "table  [ tab : rhicbb ] shows the main beam parameters for polarized proton operation , both achieved and design . in rhic the beam  beam effect is strongest in proton operation .",
    ".main rhic parameters achieved in polarized proton operation that are relevant for beam  beam effects protons ( 2009 ) .",
    "note that the polarized proton bunch intensity is also limited by intensity dependent depolarization effects in the ags . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     prior to a long - range compensation attempt , a position scan of the wire on each beam was performed with a wire current of 50 a. a 36@xmath736 bunch pattern with six non - colliding bunches was chosen to enable a comparison of the lifetime in the presence of the wire between single beam and colliding beams simultaneously .",
    "the corresponding beam loss rates as a function of beam to wire separation on both colliding and non - colliding bunches were measured .",
    "the initial beam loss rates with colliding beams were stabilized to the nominal 10% per hour .",
    "the maximum total beam losses for the wire movements towards the beam at fixed current were constrained to 100150% per hour for a very short period to avoid disrupting the beam quality significantly for subsequent measurements .",
    "figure  [ honoho ] shows the evolution of the intensity between bunches with and without head - on collisions .",
    "it is evident that the bunches with the head - on collisions have a more severe effect from the lr forces of the wire .",
    "several hypotheses can be formulated to explain the increased losses for bunches with head - on collision .    *",
    "the dynamic aperture for the bunches with head - on is significantly smaller than that of the single beam which could lead to the observed beam losses .",
    "* it was also suggested by an anonymous referee that the addition of the head - on collisions enhances the diffusion leading to enhanced losses in the presence of long - range interactions .",
    "figure  [ honoho ] clearly shows a larger initial slope for bunch intensities with collisions .",
    "however , it is difficult to untangle the contribution from the reduced dynamic aperture as opposed to enhanced diffusion .",
    "* the additional tune shift due to the wire along with large head - on tune shift could lead to beam losses due to very limited tune space available .",
    "no tune optimization was performed during the experiment . *",
    "the effect of the wire on the orbit can introduce a static offset between the two beams at the ip which is approximately proportional to the wire distance .",
    "a large offset due to the kick from the wire can lead to emittance blow - up and beam losses  @xcite .",
    "the relative offset at the collision point during the wire scan with 50 a ( see fig .  [ orbitoff ] ) is well below the 1  @xmath1 level which is very small .",
    "however , simulations to support each of the above hypotheses to explain its contribution towards observed losses is beyond the scope of this paper .      the bunch spacing and the interaction region geometry in rhic does not inherently have lr beam  beam interactions .",
    "it is therefore necessary to shift the collision point towards the dx magnet closest to the dc wires as noted before .",
    "this location enables an artificially induced lr interaction between the two beams and simultaneously allows for a minimum phase advance between the lr interaction and dc wires ( 6 deg ) .",
    "additionally , this location has sufficient aperture for an orbit scan with the range of interest ( 310  @xmath1 )",
    ". figure  [ fig : orbit ] shows the trajectories of the blue and yellow rings with the lr interaction set at approximately 3.1  @xmath1 .",
    "the individual bunch intensities and beam losses were recorded during the position scan with the lr compensation  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ lonolo ] shows the beam losses as a function of the wire position . in the blue ring",
    ", the losses are always increasing as the wire approaches the beam .",
    "therefore , no evidence of compensation of the lr interaction from the blue beam is visible .",
    "however , in the yellow ring , the beam lifetime improved as the beam to wire distance approaches 3  @xmath1 ( fig .  [ lonolo ] ) .",
    "consecutive retractions and restoration of the beam to wire distance to 3  @xmath1 show similar improvement of the beam lifetime . this indicates a compensation of the effect of lr interaction by the dc wire .",
    "in addition to beam losses , the individual bunch intensities with and without lr interactions and simultaneous compensation is shown in fig .",
    "note that all 36 bunches experience the effect of the dc wire , but only 30 bunches experience lr interactions .",
    "therefore , only bunches with an lr interaction can experience a compensation . in the blue ring ,",
    "the bunch intensity evolution is similar for bunches with and without lr compensation .",
    "hence , only the effect from the wire is visible .",
    "the bunches with lr interaction and simultaneous compensation have reduced beam losses as compared to the bunches that only see the wire .",
    "this is consistent with the beam loss measurements ( fig .",
    "[ lonolo ] ) .",
    "long - range beam  beam experiments were conducted in rhic from 2005 to 2009 .",
    "the motivation for these were two - fold .",
    "first , the experimental data can benchmark simulation codes for situations of strong localized long - range beam  beam interactions as they will exist in the lhc .",
    "second , the compensation of a single long - range beam ",
    "beam interaction can be tested in a scheme that is also usable in the lhc .",
    "these experiments complement the experience with long - range beam  beam interactions in the sp@xmath0s and tevatron , wire experiments in the sps , and the partial long - range compensation in da@xmath6ne .",
    "the rhic wires created strong localized long - range beam  beam effects , comparable in strength to the effect expected in the lhc , with a beam that has a lifetime typical of hadron colliders , and including head - on beam  beam collisions .",
    "the observed orbit and tune changes due to the wire were as expected .",
    "the effect of the long - range beam  beam interactions on the beam loss rate is sensitive to a number of beam parameters such as the tunes and chromaticities .",
    "fitting the beam lifetime @xmath8 to an exponential function @xmath9 as a function of the distance @xmath10 between the beam and the wire , exponents @xmath11 in the range between 1.7 and 16 were found .",
    "distances smaller than 5  @xmath1 created losses too large for collider operation .",
    "the experimentally observed distance from the wire to the beam at which large beam losses set in could be reproduced in simulations within 1  @xmath1 .",
    "the beam lifetime with long - range interactions created by the wire was degraded further through head - on collisions . a single attempt to compensate long - range beam ",
    "beam interaction via a dc wire showed evidence of compensation .",
