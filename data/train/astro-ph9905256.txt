    "interactions between cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons and the hot , ionized plasma in galaxy clusters introduce changes in the spectrum of the cmb . at wavelengths of 1  cm",
    "we observe this sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) @xcite as a decrease in the intensity of the cmb ; this decrement @xmath1 at projected cluster radius @xmath2 can be expressed as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the thomson cross section , @xmath5 is the electron rest mass , @xmath6 is the electron number density and @xmath7 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "note that the fractional change in the cmb temperature @xmath8 is independent of redshift ; it depends only on properties of the icm .",
    "higher order corrections to this expression and a consideration of the effects of cluster peculiar velocities on the cmb spectrum can be found elsewhere ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the typical central decrement for a massive @xmath9 galaxy cluster is @xmath10  mk , and for typical radio telescope system temperatures the sze decrement is only a few parts in @xmath11 of the power detected by the receiver , making sze observations challenging .",
    "characteristics of radio interferometry make it well suited to meet this challenge . perhaps the most important of these is that only the correlated portion of the receiver output is signal , while the uncorrelated output serves as noise ; differential ground spillover and detector noise are naturally separated from the cluster decrement .",
    "another is that interferometry effectively simultaneously differences over the sky , easily filtering the smoothly distributed @xmath123  k background from the cluster sze decrement we seek .",
    "finally , with interferometry one obtains information on many scales simultaneously ; by placing some dishes at larger separations it is straightforward to filter out point source contributions .",
    "-10pt , and the synthesized beam is represented by the white ellipse in the lower left of each frame .",
    "[ fig : szclusters],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=100.0% ]    -10pt    over the past several years , carlstrom , joy and collaborators have developed sensitive , low noise receivers and used them at the bima and ovro observatories to obtain high quality sze data on a sample of 27 intermediate redshift clusters @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : szclusters ] contains greyscale sze images and signal to noise contour overlays of 6 clusters . the contours are spaced by 2@xmath13 , and the white ellipses in the lower left of each frame represent the fwhm of the synthesized beam .    as demonstrated by figure [ fig : szclusters ] , the interferometric sze imaging experiment does deliver high signal to noise sze images of intermediate redshift clusters .",
    "we use these sze data to constrain the cluster icm distribution , and , in combination with published measurements of the icm temperature , these data enable estimates of cluster icm masses and mass fractions @xcite . in combination with x - ray images of galaxy clusters , the sze data allow one to estimate cluster sizes and measure direct , distance - ladder - independent distances .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness @xmath14 at projected cluster radius @xmath2 can be expressed as @xmath15 where @xmath6 is the electron number density , @xmath16 is the temperature dependent cooling coefficient and @xmath17 .",
    "note that @xmath14 depends on the square of the electron density , and is highly redshift dependent . because of the different dependence on the electron density , observations of @xmath14 and @xmath8 provide a direct measure of the line of sight distance through the cluster . with additional assumptions about the cluster geometry",
    ", we can combine this line of sight size with the angular size of the cluster on the sky to estimate the cluster angular diameter distance @xmath18 .",
    "we are currently using archival x - ray data to finalize distance estimates in our ensemble of 27 sze clusters @xcite .",
    "-10pt to -10pt",
    "the difficulty of detecting x - ray emission from high redshift clusters even with the high quality x - ray instruments available today is made clear by eqn .",
    "[ eq : xray ] .",
    "indeed , it is the redshift independent nature of the sze ( see eqn .",
    "[ eq : deltat ] ) that makes it an ideal tool for studying collapsed structures at high redshift .",
    "the current best instruments for sze studies of high redshift clusters do not have the sensitivity required to detect sizeable numbers of clusters in a non - targeted search within reasonable observing times of 1  mth to 1  yr .",
    "therefore , we have proposed to build a new array composed of ten 2.5  m dishes and a wide - band digital correlator .",
    "this array , when operating at 1  cm , is optimized for high redshift cluster detection and will be approximately 100 times more sensitive than our current sze imaging experiment on bima .    in this era of large telescopes",
    "it may be surprising to learn that the best telescope size for sze cluster studies is 2.5  m. there are two main reasons for this .",
    "first , the angular size @xmath19 of the primary beam of a radio telescope scales with the dish diameter @xmath20 as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the observation wavelength . @xmath19 determines the field size in a survey , and cluster signal on scales larger than @xmath23 is lost . for 1  cm observations on a 6.1  m dish ,",
    "the fwhm of the primary beam is @xmath24  arcmin , whereas for the 2.5  m telescopes @xmath25  arcmin .",
    "the primary beam of a 2.5  m dish is better matched to cluster angular scales than a 6.1  m dish .",
    "second , as is shown graphically in figure [ fig : dishes ] , interferometry samples the cluster visibility , which is the fourier transform of the cmb decrement distribution on the sky .",
    "cluster visibilities typically fall off exponentially with distance from the origin @xmath26 ( as opposed to point sources whose fourier transforms are independent of @xmath26 ) .",
    "therefore , with smaller dishes one samples a region of the u - v plane where there is significantly more cluster flux .",
    "-10pt to -10pt    the proposed wide - band digital correlator will enable us to use a larger fraction of the signal output from the 10  ghz bandwidth receivers .",
    "currently , the maximum bandwidth at bima is @xmath12800  mhz ; thus , the proposed 8  ghz correlator will increase the sensitivity by an order of magnitude .",
    "in addition to higher throughput , the wide - band correlator provides enhanced image quality .",
    "as is apparent in figure [ fig : wideband ] , the fraction of the u - v plane sampled in a 7  hr exposure with the old correlator ( top left ) is much smaller than the fraction sampled in the same exposure with the new correlator ( bottom left ) .",
    "this additional u - v coverage leads to a synthesized beam ( right panels ) which has smaller sidelobes .",
    "this enhanced image quality simplifies structure detection in sze images .",
    "x - ray samples of high redshift clusters are disappointingly small , primarily because of the strong redshift dependence of cluster emission ( see eqn . [ eq : xray ] ) ; only the most luminous clusters at each redshift tend to be found",
    ". however , with this sensitive new sze array , we will be able to carry out a survey of @xmath10  deg@xmath27 per month and detect all clusters more massive than @xmath28  @xmath29 , independent of their redshift .",
    "interestingly , the cluster selection function from such a survey is essentially a cut in cluster binding mass .",
    "so not only will an sze survey yield a sizeable high redshift cluster sample for the first time , but the survey will also deliver a sample which is much easier to understand than typical x - ray samples at intermediate redshift .",
    "we determine the survey mass limit as a function of redshift through mock observations of n - body plus sph simulations of galaxy clusters .",
    "these mock sze observations include noise and have exposures tuned so that we will be able to survey 1  deg@xmath27 in a month .",
    "the n - body plus sph simulations are state of the art simulations sampled from four different cosmological models : ( 1 ) scdm : standard , biased @xmath30 cdm , ( 2 ) ocdm : unbiased @xmath31 cdm , ( 3 ) lcdm : unbiased @xmath31 and @xmath32 cdm , and ( 4 ) @xmath33cdm : @xmath34 but cdm power spectrum with @xmath35 ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "these simulations include only gas dynamics and gravity .",
    "we use three particle species ; this allows us to follow tidal fields from surrounding large scale structure while still resolving the dynamics in the cluster core .",
    "we incorporate no early heating of the icm from galaxy formation .    to determine the detection limit at each redshift we use outputs of the 48 simulations from the appropriate redshift ; with this approach the morphological evolution of galaxy clusters is naturally included .",
    "we determine the detection probability in each mock observation by fitting a cluster model and determining the @xmath36 between the best fitting and null models .",
    "we set our detection threshold at 5@xmath13 .",
    "figure [ fig : selection ] ( left ) is a plot of limiting mass versus redshift .",
    "the uncertainties on the limiting mass correspond to the scatter about the best fit @xmath36-binding mass relation , determined using mock observations of the entire cluster ensemble at each redshift ; this scatter is an indication of the morphological sensitivity of the detection threshold .",
    "we find that the limiting mass is independent of cosmological model at least for the four models tested .",
    "also in figure [ fig : selection ] ( right ) is a press - schechter estimate of the surface density of clusters more massive than @xmath37  @xmath29 as a function of redshift for three cosmological models ( noted on the figure ) .",
    "these models are all normalized to produce the correct cluster abundance at the present epoch .",
    "note the cosmological sensitivity of the cluster surface densities ; we expect to find very few clusters with our survey if @xmath30 , whereas for more favored , low @xmath38 models we expect hundreds of clusters @xcite .      in figure",
    "[ fig : survey ] we plot the survey yield after one month ( dotted line ) and one year ( solid line ) , where we have assumed that the currently favored model @xmath31 and @xmath32 is correct ( if @xmath39 the cluster count increases ) . for comparison",
    "we also plot the yield of 200 clusters from a deep rosat pspc x - ray cluster survey @xcite . note that after a one month sze survey we will have more redshift @xmath40 clusters than the deep rosat survey .",
    "after one year we expect to have @xmath12100 clusters at redshifts @xmath41 and almost 400 clusters at redshifts @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "this highly sensitive probe for massive collapsed structures in the high redshift universe constitutes an exceedingly powerful test of current structure formation models .",
    "the sze survey itself will yield a list of galaxy clusters and constraints on the cluster surface density .",
    "cluster redshifts , masses , gas distributions and galaxy populations can then be examined through followup observations with x - ray satellites and 8  m class telescopes like the vlt .",
    "we anticipate that the scope and number of scientific issues addressed with followup observations of the high redshift clusters from the sze survey will lead to enormous progress in cosmology .",
