    "the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics describes the long time behavior of solutions of an initial value problem where the hamiltonian generating the evolution depends slowly on time .",
    "the theorem relates these solutions to spectral information of the instantaneous hamiltonian .",
    "traditionally , the adiabatic theorem is stated for hamiltonians that have an eigenvalue which is separated by a gap from the rest of the spectrum .",
    "folk wisdom is that some form of a gap condition is a _ sine qua non _ for an adiabatic theorem to hold .",
    "this is based on the following simple but at the same time rather forceful argument : the notion of hamiltonian that depend slowly on time makes sense provided the system in question has a finite intrinsic time scale which determines what slow and fast mean . in quantum mechanics the intrinsic time scale is often determined by the gaps in the spectrum ( and planck s constant ) @xcite .",
    "for example , a harmonic oscillator with natural frequency @xmath0 , has gaps in the spectrum whose size is @xmath1 .",
    "the condition for adiabaticity is @xmath2 . in the @xmath3",
    "limit the intrinsic time diverges and @xmath4 is never adiabatic .",
    "this suggests that one can not expect a general adiabatic theorem to hold in the absence of gaps .",
    "it is , of course , conceivable that in the absence of a gap some other property may determine a relevant and intrinsic time scale .",
    "for example , in the case of linearly crossing eigenvalues , the difference in slopes of the eigenvalues at the point of crossing @xmath5 , fig .",
    "1 , determines a time scale , @xmath6 , that takes over as the time scale associated with the gap diverges .",
    "an adiabatic theorem that builds on this fact goes back to born and fock @xcite .",
    "but , at the same time , a general adiabatic theorem in the absence of a gap condition which does not use some other special properties , like a slope condition , seems unlikely and on physical grounds , morally wrong .        nevertheless , the folk wisdom is actually wrong since we shall prove a general adiabatic theorem without a gap condition .",
    "all one really needs for the adiabatic theorem is a finite dimensional spectral projection for the hamiltonian that depends smoothly on time .",
    "the role of the gap is to provide an _ a - priori _ _ rate _ at which the adiabatic limit is approached . in the absence of a gap , there is no such _ a - priori _ information on the rate at which the adiabatic limit is approached and it could be arbitrarily slow .",
    "our approach to an adiabatic theorem without a gap condition has some of the flavor of an operator analog of the riemann - lebesgue lemma @xcite .",
    "if a function and also its derivative are in @xmath7 then it is an elementary exercise that its fourier transform decays at infinity at least as fast as an inverse power of the argument .",
    "the riemann - lebesgue lemma says that , in fact , the fourier transform of any @xmath7 function vanishes at infinity .",
    "the loss of _ a - priori _ information about the derivative translates to loss of information about the rate at which the function vanishes at infinity . in this analogy differentiability",
    "is the analog of the gap condition , and the @xmath7 condition is the analog of the smoothness condition on the spectral projection .",
    "a gap condition is associated with spectral stability .",
    "situations without a gap condition often lead to spectral instabilities .",
    "this may suggest that an adiabatic theorem without a gap condition may be an academic exercise in the sense that it may have no applications and that its premise , the existence of a smooth spectral projection , is either contrived or would be hard to establish in applications .",
    "for example , for applications to atomic physics , where the essential spectrum is absolutely continuous , @xcite , embedded eigenvalues tend to dissolve to resonances @xcite so it is unlikely that the projection associated to an embedded eigenvalue would be continuous .",
    "indeed , we do not know of an application to _ embedded _ eigenvalues",
    ".    an interesting application of the adiabatic theorem without a gap condition is to _ eigenvalues at threshold_. a ground state at threshold is a feature of any reasonable model hamiltonian for atoms interacting with a radiation field .",
    "models that do not have this property describe unstable atoms , or stable atoms in a world that has no soft photons .",
    "models of atom - photon systems have the property that when the fine structure constant , @xmath8 , is small , the ground state describes the bound electrons of the atom and a photon field close to the vacuum .",
    "soft photons are responsible for the absence of a gap in these models .",
    "a relatively simple yet interesting model for which the existence ( and uniqueness ) of the ground state @xcite as well as gaplessness @xcite are known rigorously is the spin - boson hamiltonian : the model of a two level system coupled to a radiation field .",
    "this has also been established for a model of non - relativistic qed @xcite : a model of nonrelativistic electrons coupled to a radiation field with an ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "unfortunately , for _ real _ qed @xcite , where both the electrons and photons are treated as relativistic quantum fields , all that is rigorously known at present is on a perturbative level .",
    "our original motivation was to prove an adiabatic theorem for models describing atom - photon interaction .",
    "we proved this for the dicke model , which is the simplest model of this kind , in @xcite .",
    "we then realized that one could prove a much more general adiabatic theorem without a gap condition which is not specific to models of atoms in radiation field , but would cover these as a special case .",
    "the adiabatic theorem without a gap condition resolves a problem regarding the relation between the quantum mechanics with and without radiation field .",
    "if the folk wisdom was true , and a gap condition was a necessary ingredient in the adiabatic theorem , one would expect the adiabatic theorem to hold for a two level system , but not for the spin - boson model .",
    "since the spin - boson model is clearly a more accurate description of nature than the model of a two level system , the success of the adiabatic theorem in numerous applications where a two level model has been used , would appear like a mystery .",
    "the fact that adiabatic theorems do not really need a gap condition means that at least as far as the adiabatic theorem is concerned quantum mechanics without radiation and quantum mechanics with radiation sit in the same basket .",
    "an interesting problem that we do not resolve here is to show that not only is the adiabatic theory of quantum mechanics ( without radiation ) qualitatively correct , but it is also quantitatively accurate . for the dicke model ,",
    "some results in this direction are given in @xcite .",
    "to formulate the problem of the adiabatic theory more precisely it is convenient , and traditional , to replace the physical time @xmath9 by the scaled time @xmath10 .",
    "one is then concerned with the solution of the initial value problem @xmath11 in the limit of large @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is a self - adjoint hamiltonian which depends sufficiently smoothly on @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is a vector ( in hilbert space ) valued function",
    ". we shall be more specific about what we mean by smoothness below .",
    "@xmath13 evolves slowly in _ physical _ time for a _ long _ interval of time with _ finite _ variation in @xmath13 .",
    "quantum adiabatic theorems say that the solution of the initial value problem is characterized , in the adiabatic limit @xmath16 , by spectral information .",
    "there is no single adiabatic theorem .",
    "different adiabatic theorems focus on different aspects of the problem : what is assumed about @xmath13 and @xmath17 ; about properties of the projection @xmath18 ; the notion of smoothness , and what are the optimal error estimates , etc .",
    "all have the following structure : let @xmath18 be an appropriate family of spectral projections for @xmath13 .",
    "let the initial data be such that @xmath19 .",
    "then , for an appropriate value of @xmath20 , @xmath21 for @xmath22 we take the right - hand side to mean @xmath23 .    in the present work",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to the case where @xmath17 is compactly supported .",
    "then we can , without loss , take @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "second , we shall restrict ourselves to uniform error estimates , i.e. error estimates that hold for _ all _ scaled time .",
    "this is actually the easier case .",
    "in adiabatic theory it is often possible to obtain much sharper results for times outside the support of @xmath17 .",
    "our main result is the following :    [ main ] suppose that @xmath18 is smooth finite rank spectral projection , for the bounded , smooth hamiltonian @xmath13 .",
    "then , the evolution of the initial state @xmath19 , is such that @xmath25 for all @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "this is the weakest , but at the same time , the simplest , and most characteristic of our results .",
    "as it stands , it does not even apply to the schrdinger operator because @xmath13 is assumed to be bounded . in sect .",
    "[ unbounded1 ] we shall state a generalization of this result to unbounded operators .",
    "there are two reasons why we have chosen to state the weaker result .",
    "the first is that we did not want to obscure the central issue , and what is new in this work , behind a mask of technicalities .",
    "the second is almost ideological .",
    "the adiabatic problem is an infrared , low energy , problem .",
    "the central issue in an adiabatic theorem without a gap condition is to control low energy excitations .",
    "the unboundedness of schrdinger operators is an ultraviolet problem .",
    "this problem has well developed analytical tools @xcite , and has nothing to do with the core of the infrared problem of adiabatic evolution .",
    "once one has an adiabatic theorem without a gap condition for bounded operators , the extension to unbounded ones is technical .",
    "we have stated the theorem with a condition of smoothness .",
    "much less than smoothness is needed and we shall formulate a stronger result requiring only piecewise , twice differentiability of @xmath18 in sect .",
    "[ unbounded1 ] .",
    "one reason why we have chosen to state a weaker result is again for simplicity , and the second is that it is likely that even the result in sect .",
    "[ unbounded1 ] is not optimal .",
    "the theorem , as stated , does not cover the case of eigenvalue crossings .",
    "this is because at eigenvalue crossing the spectral projection @xmath18 is not smooth ( @xmath27 is discontinuous ) .",
    "eigenvalue crossings can be handled by a method due to kato @xcite and we shall state a stronger version of the theorem that allows for finitely many crossings in sect . [ unbounded1 ] .",
    "davies and spohn @xcite studied the evolution of a driven , finite dimensional quantum system coupled to a heat bath .",
    "their prime interest was the linear response of such a system which is closely related to the adiabatic limit .",
    "they choose a hamiltonian of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the time dependent hamiltonian of the driven , finite dimensional , quantum sub - system , @xmath30 is the hamiltonian of a quasi - free fermion field , and @xmath31 is the interaction .",
    "the coupling vanishes in the adiabatic limit @xmath32 .",
    "they show that the induced evolution of the finite dimensional sub - system is governed by a ( finite dimensional ) hamiltonian of the form @xmath33 davies and spohn then proceed to analyze the evolution of this finite dimensional system using some of the ideas that enter into the adiabatic theory of kato @xcite .",
    "davies and spohn do not prove an adiabatic theorem in the sense that the physical evolution adheres to a spectral subspace of the coupled hamiltonian .",
    "in this section we recall some of the basic adiabatic theorems : adiabatic theorems with a gap condition , for crossing eigenvalues , adiabatic theorems beyond all orders , and adiabatic theorems for scattering .",
    "we examine how these relate to the adiabatic theorem without a gap condition .      the first satisfactory formulation and rigorous proof of an adiabatic theorem in the",
    "then new quantum mechanics was given in 1928 by born and fock @xcite .",
    "they were motivated by a point of view advocated by ehrenfest @xcite , which identified classical adiabatic invariants as the observables that get quantized .",
    "the theorem they proved was geared to show that quantum numbers are preserved by adiabatic deformations .    born and fock proved an adiabatic theorem for hamiltonian operators , @xmath13 , with simple discrete spectrum .",
    "they showed that in eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) one can take @xmath34 .",
    "their proof covers hamiltonians like the one dimensional harmonic oscillator , but not the hydrogen atom , which has absolutely continuous spectrum at positive energies , and eigenvalues with multiplicities at negative energies .    in 1958",
    "kato @xcite initiated a new strategy for proving adiabatic theorems .",
    "he introduced a notion of adiabatic evolution which is purely geometric .",
    "it is associated with a natural connection in the bundle of spectral subspaces .",
    "kato s method was to compare the geometric evolution with the evolution generated by @xmath13 and to show that in the adiabatic limit the two coincide .",
    "using this idea , kato was able to relax the condition that @xmath13 had simple discrete spectrum .",
    "he showed that the adiabatic theorem holds when @xmath18 is a _ finite dimensional _ spectral projection associated with an _",
    "isolated eigenvalue_. no assumption on the spectral type of @xmath13 restricted to @xmath35 need be made , fig .",
    "kato s results cover the case of schrdinger operator for the hydrogen atom .",
    "however it does not cover schrdinger operators that arise for instance in the study of condensed matter physics , where there is no discrete spectrum at all .",
    "kato s results were extended in @xcite , to @xmath18 that need not be associated with an eigenvalue , and whose rank could also be infinite . in particular , the initial data could lie in a subspace corresponding to an energy band provided it is separated by a gap from the rest of the spectrum .",
    "there are interesting and more delicate adiabatic theorems that apply provided one considers eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) for times @xmath14 that lie outside the support of @xmath17 . assuming a gap condition and smoothness ( or analyticity ) of @xmath13 it has been shown @xcite that the adiabatic theorem eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) holds with @xmath36 .",
    "stronger results hold in the analytic case @xcite .      born and fock also studied the adiabatic theorem for crossing eigenvalues where the spectral projections have smooth continuations through the crossing point @xcite .",
    "born and fock showed that if crossing is of order @xmath37 ( linear crossing is @xmath38 ) then eq .  ( [ general ] ) holds with @xmath39 .",
    "this problem was later studied in much detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "kato @xcite also considered the adiabatic theorems for crossing eigenvalues .",
    "he did not make any explicit assumptions about how the eigenvalues behave near crossings .",
    "the only assumption he did make was that @xmath18 could be continued through the crossings , and that there are finitely many crossings . under these conditions",
    "he showed that eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) holds with @xmath22 .",
    "we are aware of one example of an adiabatic theorem without a gap condition for operators that have essential spectrum .",
    "this is a result of @xcite for rank one perturbations of dense point spectra .",

    "( [ general ] ) .",
    "adiabatic scattering theory relates the time dependent scattering matrix to the time independent scattering matrix .",
    "results in this direction are described in @xcite .",
    "these have very little to do with the kind of adiabatic theorems we consider here . in scattering",
    "theory a time scale is determined by the initial data : the scattered particle spends a finite amount of time in the region of interaction , and in the limit that the interaction varies slowly , it does not see the variation in the hamiltonian .",
