    "<S> note that @xmath127 describes the heavy tails of the distributions better than @xmath128 or @xmath129 , implying that unbinding of these dna duplexes by force can not be accounted for using one - dimensional models . </S>",

    "<S> the experimental data were further interpreted using a gaussian distribution for free energy barriers and transition state locations separating the folded and unfolded states of ubiquitin @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the physics of the measured non - exponential decay can be quanitatively explained using our theory ( eq .  [ eqn : solution ] ) based on the fb model . </S>",
    "<S> the almost exact fit of the theory to experiment for @xmath49 at @xmath130 pn in fig.[kuo_fit](a ) shows the presence of dynamical disorder .    for polyproteins ( used in afm experiments ) </S>",
    "<S> there are two possible origins for disorder : ( i ) couplings between neighboring modules ; ( ii ) disorder inherent to each module . </S>",
    "<S> because a simple statistical relationship such as binomial factorization associated with the kinetics of individual modules @xcite is expected to break down for the scenario ( i ) , experiments that change the number of modules can discriminate between the two scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> regardless of the origin of heterogeneity , our theory can be used to extract the parameters characterizing disorder effects .    </S>",
    "<S> if the bottleneck represents molecular gating or breathing dynamics in a multimodular construct of polyubiquitin , @xmath5 should in principle be an increasing function of @xmath10 . as the applied tension increases , the amplitude of transverse fluctuations decreases , hence increasing the corresponding frequency . even in bell model </S>",
    "<S> , the extracted parameters @xmath112 and @xmath122 should be interpreted as capturing the geometry of the landscape , which changes with @xmath10 @xcite . from the fits of @xmath131 at different values of force we extracted @xmath53 and @xmath5 at each @xmath10 ( bottom of fig.[kuo_fit](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effective rate constant @xmath53 changes exponentially with @xmath10 , in accord with bell model . by using @xmath132 </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath133 nm and @xmath134 s@xmath135 . the value of @xmath112 is in excellent agreement with experimental measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we also find a rough exponentially increasing trend in @xmath5 with @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> increase of @xmath5 implies that the rate of change of accessible surface increases as @xmath10 increases , supporting our physical intuition about the influence of @xmath10 on the internal dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> a nonexponential @xmath109 in the force - clamp condition corresponds to a heavy tailed @xmath4 in the force - ramp condition . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters determined for polyubiquitin satisfy @xmath136 for all @xmath10 values ( fig.[kuo_fit](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a heavy tailed @xmath4 will manifest itself over the entire range of @xmath137 pn / s that gives rise to the most probable forces @xmath138 pn .    </S>",
    "<S> _ unbinding of dna duplexes : _ the effects of disorder manifest themselves dramatically in unzipping experiments on dna duplexes between 5-ggctcccttctaccactgac-3 and 3--5 , where underlined sequences are complimentary to each other @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the measured rupture force distributions have heavy tails at high @xmath10 , though the physical reasons for the tails were not discussed in the original paper . </S>",

    "<S> [ analysis ] shows the unzipping force distribution at two pulling speeds , 8 nm / s and 1600 nm / s , and fits using our model , compared to two other models commonly employed in analyzing dfs experiments . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that our theory for @xmath108 using the fb model most accurately fits the force data . </S>",
    "<S> two other models , based on the bell model @xcite and a cubic potential @xcite , fail to capture the tail part of the data because they incorporate no disorder , only unbinding through a one - dimensional free energy profile . for 8 </S>",
    "<S> nm / s , the gating frequencies are almost zero ( @xmath139 s@xmath135 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath5 increases by nearly four orders of magnitude to @xmath140 s@xmath135 at @xmath117 nm / s . </S>",
    "<S> given that the bubble dynamics of a dna duplex occur with a characteristic time scale of @xmath141 @xmath2s @xcite , our extracted @xmath5 values are too large for breathing motion of base pairs to be a source of disorder . </S>",
    "<S> it is more reasonable to surmise that each duplex is pulled from starkly different and very slowly interconverting conformations , similar to that found in holliday junctions and recbcd . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of this disorder is likely to be in the heterogeneity of base pairings , although the experiment was intended to probe the unbinding dynamics from a homogeneous sample made of two dna strands with perfect complimentarity . </S>",
    "<S> the large increase in @xmath5 as @xmath142 increases suggests that tension facilitates interconversion between states , which accords well with the expectation that force lowers barriers between distinct bound states .    </S>",
    "<S> applications of our theory reveal that by analyzing data from single - molecule pulling experiments over a range of forces and loading rates one can infer the role that dynamical disorder , intrinsic to the molecule , plays in unfolding or unbinding kinetics . </S>",
    "<S> the observed non - exponential kinetics in survival probability or fat tails in the unfolding force distributions can not be captured by theories based on one - dimensional free energy profiles . </S>",
    "<S> our work shows that by using an auxiliary coordinate in addition to extension we can quantitatively predict the consequences of disorder in the dynamics of biological molecules . </S>",
    "<S> the theory provides a conceptual framework for analyzing future single molecule pulling experiments on complexes involving proteins , dna , and rna in which heterogeneity is sure to play a prominent role .    </S>",
