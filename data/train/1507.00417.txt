    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are considered to be one of the most precise tools for determining astronomical distances @xcite .",

    "the accelerated expansion of the universe and the presence of dark energy were discovered through sne ia used as standardizable candles @xcite .",
    "the effectiveness of sne ia as distance indicators and standard candles is hampered by the systematic uncertainties related to their explosion mechanism and progenitor systems , and more importantly , the line - of - sight extinction .",
    "the distance @xmath4 measured in parsec to a sn is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are its apparent and absolute magnitudes at wavelength @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the extinction .",

    "more specifically , based on the uv to near - ir photometry of sn 2014j obtained with the wfc3 filters aboard the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) and ground - based telescopes , @xcite ( 2014 , hereafter a14 ) determined the reddening curve @xmath15 for sn 2014j over a wide wavelength range by comparing the colors of sn  2014j with that of sn  2011fe , a reddening - free sn ia .",
