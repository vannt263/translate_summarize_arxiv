    "this paper addresses the problem of constructing hardware - efficient cryptographic primitives suitable for assuring trustworthiness of resource - constrained devices used in services and applications provided by the next generation of wireless communication networks .",
    "the importance of improving security of wireless networks for our society is hard to overestimate . in 2014 ,",
    "the annual loss to the global economy from cybercrimes was more than $ 400 billion  @xcite .",
    "this number can quickly grow larger with the rapid growth of _ internet - of - things _ ( iot ) applications . in coming years `` things '' such as household appliances , meters , sensors , vehicles , etc .",
    "are expected to be accessible and controlled via local networks or the internet , opening an entirely new range of services appealing to users .",
    "the ideas of self - driving cars , health - tracking wearables , and remote surgeries do not sound like science - fiction any longer .",
    "the number of wirelessly connected devices is expected to grow to a few tens of billions in the next five years  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the new technologies are appealing to the attackers as well .",
    "as processing power and connectivity become cheaper , the cost of performing a cyberattack drops , making it easier for adversaries of all types to penetrate networks .",
    "attacks are becoming more frequent , more sophisticated , and more widespread .",
    "a connected household appliance becomes a target for all hackers around the globe unless appropriate security mechanisms are implemented .",
    "household appliances typically do not have the same level of protection as computer systems .",
    "a compromised device can potentially be used as an entry point for a cyberattack on other devices connected to the network .",
    "the first proven cyberattack involving `` smart '' household appliances has been already reported in  @xcite . in this attack ,",
    "more than 750.000 malicious emails targeting enterprises and individuals worldwide were sent from more than 100.000 consumer devices such as home - networking routers , multi - media centers , tvs , refrigerators , etc .",
    "no more than 10 emails were initiated from any single ip - address , making the attack difficult to block based on location .",
    "the attack surface of future iot with billions of connected devices will be enormous .",
    "in addition to a larger attack surface , the return value for performing a cyberattack grows .",
    "the assets accessible via tomorrow s networks ( hardware , software , information , and revenue streams ) are expected to be much greater than the ones available today , increasing incentive for cyber criminals and underground economies  @xcite .",
    "a growing black market for breached data serves as a further encouragement . the damage caused by an individual actor",
    "may not be limited to a business or reputation , but could have a severe impact on public safety , national economy , and/or national security .",
    "the tremendous growth in the number and type of wirelessly connected devices , as well as the increased incentive for performing attacks change the threat landscape and create new challenges for security .",
    "the situation is complicated even further by the fact that many end - point iot devices require utmost efficiency in the use of communication , computing , storage and energy resources .",
    "a typical iot device spends most of its `` life '' in a sleep mode .",
    "it gets activated at periodic intervals , transmits a small amount of data and then shuts down again . to satisfy extreme limitations of resource - constrained iot devices , very efficient cryptographic primitives for implementing encryption , data integrity protection , authentication , etc . are required .",
    "invertible mappings are among the most frequently used primitives in cryptography  @xcite .",
    "for example , the round function of a block cipher  @xcite has to be invertible in order to result in unique decryption .",
    "stream ciphers  @xcite and hash functions  @xcite use invertible state mappings to prevent incremental reduction of the entropy of the state .",
    "this paper presents a sufficient condition for invertibility of mappings @xmath4 of type @xmath0 .",
    "such a single - variable @xmath5-valued mapping can be interpreted as an @xmath1-variable boolean mapping @xmath6 in which the boolean variable @xmath7 represents the bit number @xmath8 of the input @xmath9 and the boolean function @xmath10 represents the bit number @xmath8 of the output @xmath11 , i.e. : @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "for example , the 4-variable boolean mapping @xmath14 corresponds to the single - variable 16-valued mapping @xmath15 where `` @xmath16 '' is addition modulo 16 .",
    "note that the corresponding single - variable @xmath5-valued mapping may not have a closed form .    in order to check",
    "if a mapping of type  ( [ map ] ) is invertible or not , we generally need an exponential in @xmath1 number of steps .",
    "the condition derived in this paper can be checked in @xmath2 time , where @xmath3 is the size of representation of the largest boolean function in the mapping .",
    "so , it can be used for constructing secure invertible mappings with a small hardware implementation cost .",
    "for example , we show how the presented results can be used in stream cipher design .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ not ] summarizes basic notations used in the sequel . in section  [ prev ] , we describe previous work and show that previous methods can not explain invertibility of some mappings which can be handled by the presented approach .",
    "section  [ main ] presents the main result .",
    "section  [ compl ] estimates the complexity of checking the presented condition .",
    "section  [ appl ] shows how the presented results can be used in stream cipher design .",
    "section  [ conc ] concludes the paper .",
    "throughout the paper , we use `` @xmath17 '' to denote the boolean xor , `` @xmath18 '' to denote the boolean and and @xmath19 to denote the boolean complement of @xmath9 , defined by @xmath20 .    the algebraic normal form ( anf )",
    "@xcite of a boolean function @xmath21 ( also called positive polarity _ reed - muller canonical form _",

    "the _ dependence set _ ( or _ support set _",
    "@xcite ) of a boolean function @xmath34 is defined by @xmath35 where @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "a mapping @xmath4 on a finite set is called _ invertible _ if @xmath38 if , and only if , @xmath39 .",
    "invertible mappings are also called _",
    "in this section , we describe previous work on invertible mappings and show that previous methods can not explain invertibility of some mappings which can be handled by the presented approach .",
    "many methods for constructing different classes of invertible mappings are known .",
    "the simplest one is to compose simple invertible operations . a substitution - permutation network ( spn )",
    "is a typical example .",
    "an spn consists of s - boxes , which permute input bits locally , and p - boxes , which diffuse input bits globally .",
    "this method of construction can not explain the invertibility of , for example , the following 4-variable mapping @xmath40 since a non - invertible operation boolean and is used .",
    "feistel  @xcite proposed a powerful technique which makes possible constructing invertible mappings from non - invertible basic operations .",
    "it is used in many block ciphers , including des  @xcite .",
    "the basic feistel construction maps two inputs , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , into two outputs as follows : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is any single - variable function .",
    "the full feistel construction iterates the above mapping any number of times .",
    "this method was extended in several directions , including _ unbalanced _ , _ homogeneous _ , _ heterogeneous _ , _ incomplete _ , and _ inconsistent _ feistel networks  @xcite .",
    "however , the feistel construction requires at least two variables .",
    "it can not explain the invertibility of mappings @xmath4 of type @xmath0 .",
    "the presented method can explain it by looking into the structure of boolean functions @xmath45 representing the bits of the output @xmath11 .",
    "shamir  @xcite introduced an interesting construction based on the fact that the mapping of type  ( [ map ] ) is invertible for almost all inputs if each @xmath45 has the form : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are arbitrary non - zero @xmath8-variable polynomials modulo a large rsa modulus @xmath3 .",
    "the `` triangular '' nature of functions @xmath45 makes it possible to perform the inversion process similarly to the way we do gaussian elimination to solve a system of linear equations .",
    "this approach can also handle @xmath47 s and @xmath48 s which mix arithmetic and boolean operations  @xcite .",
    "the approach presented in this paper is similar to the approach of shamir in that it also uses triangulation to prove invertibility .",
    "however , our functions @xmath45 are of the type @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath47 does not depend on @xmath51 .",
    "thus , in our case , the @xmath8th output may depend on the input @xmath52 such that @xmath53 .",
    "for example , in the mapping defined by equations  ( [ ex ] ) , @xmath54 depends on @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "shamir s construction was further extended by klimov and shamir  @xcite to a class on invertible mappings based on t - functions . a single - variable function @xmath11 of type @xmath57 @xmath58",
    "is defined to be a t - function if each of its output bits @xmath59 depends only on the first @xmath8 input bits @xmath60 : @xmath61 a t - function is invertible if , and only if , each output bit @xmath45 can be represented as @xmath62 this fundamental result inspired the construction which we present in this paper .",
    "the reader will easily notice that , in our construction  ( [ el_eq ] ) , functions @xmath47 s are",
    "t - functions while functions @xmath45 s are not if @xmath53 .",
    "another difference is that klimov and shamir targeted software implementation and therefore focused on mappings whose expression can be evaluated by a program with the minimal number of instructions .",
    "we target the hardware implementation .",
    "therefore , we are interested in minimizing the number of boolean operations in the expressions of boolean functions representing output bits .",
    "the construction method which we present can be used as a starting point for constructing nonlinear invertible mappings which have an efficient hardware implementation .",
    "another group of construction methods consider _ permutation polynomials _ which involve only the arithmetic operation of addition , subtraction , and multiplication .",
    "permutation polynomials are well - studied in mathematics .",
    "hermite  @xcite made a substantial progress in characterizing univariate permutation polynomials modulo a prime @xmath63 .",
    "dickson  @xcite described all univariate polynomials with degrees smaller than 5 .",
    "however , the problem remains unsolved for high degree polynomials modulo a large prime @xmath63 .",
    "the problem appears simpler for the ring of integers modulo @xmath5 .",
    "rivest  @xcite provided a complete characterization of all univariate permutation polynomials modulo @xmath5 .",
    "he proved that a polynomial @xmath64 with integral coefficients is a permutation polynomial for @xmath65 if , and only if , @xmath66 is odd , @xmath67 is even and @xmath68 is even .",
    "his powerful algebraic proof technique was further generalized by klimov and shamir  @xcite to polynomials of type @xmath69 where @xmath70 , which mix arithmetic and boolean operations .",
    "however , since the resulting polynomials are t - functions , they do not cover the construction method presented in this paper for the case when @xmath8th output depends on the input @xmath52 such that @xmath53 .",
    "-bit non - linear feedback shift register.,width=220 ]    finally , we would like to discuss the relation between the mappings of type  ( [ map ] ) and the state mappings generated by _ non - linear feedback shift registers ( nlfsrs ) _  @xcite .",
    "an @xmath1-bit nlfsr consists of @xmath1 binary stages , each capable of storing 1 bit of information , a nonlinear boolean function , called _ feedback function _ , and a clock ( see figure  [ f1 ] ) . at each clock cycle , the stage @xmath71 is updated to the value computed by the feedback function .",
    "the rest of the stages shift the content of the previous stage .",
    "thus , an @xmath1-bit nlfsr with the feedback functions @xmath44 implements the state mapping of type @xmath72 where the variable @xmath73 represents the value of the stage @xmath8 , for @xmath13 .",
    "it is well - known  @xcite that an @xmath1-bit nlfsr is invertible if , and only if , its feedback function is of type @xmath74    the mappings considered in this paper can be implemented by a more general type of non - linear state machines , shown in figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "since the content of stages is not any longer shifted from one stage to the next , but rather it is updated by some arbitrary functions , such registers are not called shift registers any longer . instead , they are called _ binary machines _  @xcite or",
    "_ registers with non - linear update _",
    "binary machines are typically smaller and faster than nlfsrs generating the same sequence  @xcite . for example",
    ", the 4-bit nlfsr with the feedback function @xmath75 generates the same set of sequences as the 4-bit binary machine implementing the 4-variable mapping defined by equations  ( [ ex ] ) .",
    "we can see that the binary machine uses 3 binary boolean operations , while the nlfsr uses 5 binary boolean operations .",
    "furthermore , the depth of feedback functions of the binary machine is smaller that the depth of the feedback function of the nlfsr .",
    "thus , the binary machine has a smaller propagation delay than the nlfsr .    -bit",
    "binary machine.,width=326 ]",
    "as we mentioned in section  [ prev ] , it is well - known how to construct invertible nlfsrs  @xcite .",
    "an @xmath1-bit nlfsr is invertible if , and only if , its feedback function is of type : @xmath76 the proof is simple , because every two consecutive states of an nlfsr overlap in @xmath71 positions .",
    "this implies that each state can have only two possible predecessors and two possible successors . if @xmath44 is in the form ( [ eq1 ] ) , then the nlfsr states which correspond to the binary @xmath1-tuples @xmath77 and @xmath78 always have different successors .",
    "the values of @xmath11 and @xmath79 depend on the value of @xmath80 and on the value of @xmath81 .",
    "the value of @xmath80 is the same for @xmath9 and @xmath82 .",
    "the value of @xmath81 is different for @xmath9 and @xmath82 .",
    "thus , @xmath83 .",
    "it is also easy to see that , if both @xmath9 and @xmath82 have the same successor , @xmath44 can not have the form  ( [ eq1 ] ) .    in the general case of mappings @xmath6",
    ", any binary @xmath1-tuple can have @xmath5 possible predecessors and @xmath5 possible successors . therefore ,",
    "to guarantee that a mapping @xmath6 is invertible , we have to check that , for all @xmath84 , @xmath85 implies that @xmath86 , for some @xmath13 .",
    "this clearly requires the number of steps which is exponential in @xmath1 .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is a more restricted sufficient condition which can be checked in @xmath2 steps . to formulate this condition ,",
    "we first introduce the notion of a free variable of a function .",
    "a variable @xmath87 is called a free variable if @xmath44 can decomposed as @xmath88 where @xmath89 .",
    "the set of free variables of @xmath44 , @xmath90 , contains all free variables of @xmath44 @xmath91    now we are ready to formulate the following sufficient condition for invertibility .",

    "@xmath94 can be re - ordered as @xmath95 to satisfy the property @xmath96 where `` @xmath97 '' stands for the union .",
    "* proof : * by contradiction .",
    "suppose that there exist a non - invertible mapping of type  ( [ map ] ) for which the conditions of the theorem hold .",
    "then , this mapping is of type @xmath98 where @xmath99 , for @xmath100 .    since the mapping  ( [ pr ] ) in non - invertible ,",
    "there exist at least two input assignments @xmath101 and @xmath102 , @xmath103 , which are mapped into the same output .",
    "we analyzing  ( [ pr ] ) row by row , we can conclude that :    * @xmath104 and @xmath105 and @xmath106 implies @xmath107 * @xmath108 and @xmath109 and @xmath110 and @xmath107 implies @xmath111 * @xmath112 * @xmath113 and @xmath114 and @xmath115 and @xmath107 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 @xmath116 implies @xmath117",
    ".    therefore , @xmath118 .",
    "we reached a contradiction .",
    "thus , the assumption that there exist a non - invertible mapping of type  ( [ map ] ) for which the conditions of the theorem hold is not true .",
    "@xmath119    an example of mapping which satisfies the conditions of theorem  [ t2 ] is : @xmath120    the reader may notice that mappings defined by theorem  [ t2 ] can be obtained by re - labeling variables in a t - function .",
    "the re - labeling is given by the ordering of free variables .",
    "so , the mapping  ( [ th_main ] ) can be viewed as a composition of a bit permutation and a t - function .",
    "since there are @xmath121 bit permutations , the class of invertible mappings considered in this paper is by a factor of @xmath121 larger than the class of invertible mappings based on t - functions .",
    "clearly , the re - labeling of variables does not change the implementation cost of a mapping .",
    "however , it might drastically change the cycle structure of the underlying state transition graph , as illustrated by the following example .",
    "consider the following 4-variable mapping based on a t - function : @xmath122 this mapping has a quite uninteresting state transition graph shown in figure  [ fm1 ] .",
    "let us re - label the variables as @xmath123 .",
    "we get the mapping : @xmath124 which has the state transition graph shown in figure  [ fm2 ] .",
    "all states , except the all-0 state , are included in one cycle .",
    "if we implement this mapping by the binary machine shown in figure  [ f2 ] and initialize the binary machine to any non - zero state , then its output generates a pseudo - random sequence with period 15 which satisfies the first two randomness postulates of golomb  @xcite , namely the balance property and the run property .",
    "no sequence generated by a nonlinear boolean function satisfy the third randomness postulate ( two - level autocorrelation property ) .",

    "obviously , if we iterate a mapping a large number of times , we do not want the sequence of generated states to be trapped in a short cycle .",
    "it is worth noting that formal verification tools based on reachability analysis can be adopted for finding short cycles in a state transition graph .",
    "there are dedicated tools to compute the number and length of cycles in state transition graphs of synchronous sequential networks , e.g. bns  @xcite which is based on sat - based bounded model checking and boolenet  @xcite which is based on binary decision diagrams .",
    "the mappings defined by theorem  [ t2 ] are invertible for any choice of boolean functions @xmath125 .",
    "the smaller is the number of boolean operations in the expressions of @xmath47 s , the smaller is its hardware implementation cost .",
    "note , that we are not restricted to represent @xmath47 s in anf .",
    "any boolean expression combining and , or , not and xor can be used .",
    "multi - level logic optimization tools , such as uc berkeley tool abc  @xcite can be applied to transform the anf or other boolean expression representing the function into an optimized multi - level expression .",
    "clearly , the choice of @xmath47 s will be guided not only by the hardware cost , but also by other criteria determining the cryptographic strength of the resulting function , e.g. nonlinearity , correlation immunity , algebraic degree , etc .",
    "( see  @xcite for requirements on cryptographically strong functions ) .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that the conditions of theorem  [ t2 ] are sufficient , but not necessary conditions for invertibility .",
    "for example , the following 4-variable mapping is invertible , but it does not satisfy them : @xmath126",

    "@xmath129 is a set which keeps track of variables which are identified as free for some @xmath45 .",

    "<S> the tremendous growth in the number and type of wirelessly connected devices in a combination with the dropping cost for performing cyberattacks create new challenges for assuring security of services and applications provided by the next generation of wireless communication networks . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is complicated even further by the fact that many end - point internet of things ( iot ) devices have very limited resources for implementing security functionality . </S>",
    "<S> this paper addresses one of the aspects of this important , many - faceted problem - the design of hardware - efficient cryptographic primitives suitable for the protection of resource - constrained iot devices . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on cryptographic primitives based on the invertible mappings of type @xmath0 . in order to check </S>",
    "<S> if a given mapping is invertible or not , we generally need an exponential in @xmath1 number of steps . in this paper , we derive a sufficient condition for invertibility which can be checked in @xmath2 time , where @xmath3 is the size of representation of the largest function in the mapping . </S>",
