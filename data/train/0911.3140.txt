    "the discovery that the universe is experiencing a phase of accelerated expansion @xcite constitutes a big challenge to theoretical physics and cosmology .",
    "the simplest explanation , the existence of a positive cosmological constant , has problems with quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "other possibilities have been investigated , either by proposing new material sources , called generically dark energy @xcite , or through the modification of the gravitational interaction itself @xcite .",
    "even the whole framework of the standard cosmological model has been questioned @xcite .",
    "it is expected that these possibilities will be tested by future observations @xcite .",
    "one bonus of this revolution was the definite fall , initiated with the advent of inflationary theory , of ancient theoretical prejudices based on the postulation of energy conditions .",
    "nowadays we know many plausible frameworks where such energy conditions can be violated . even the possibility of existence of phantom fields , violating the less severe of these conditions , the null energy condition , has been investigated and some scenarios proposed @xcite . the presence of such phantom fields may impose the existence of a future singularity , called big rip , a rupture of spacetime due to an infinite accelerated expansion , which can destroy the universe in some tens of billion years @xcite .    one natural question , which has already been asked , concerns the importance of quantum effects as one approachs the big rip : in the same way that the initial big - bang singularity may be avoided through quantum effects @xcite , one may expect that the big rip can be circumvanted due to quantum gravitational effects .",
    "this possibility has been investigated in the framework of phantom hydrodynamical fluis @xcite and phantom scalar fields @xcite . in the first",
    ", it is argued that the big rip is not eliminated , while in the second it is suggested that the big rip is indeed avoided through quantum effects .    in order to arrive at these conclusions , one must extract the relevant information from the wave function of the universe according to a definite interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "however , as it is well known , when one tries to quantize the whole universe , one can not rely on the copenhaguen interpretation of quantum mechanics because it imposes the existence of a classical domain outside the quantized system in order to generate the physical facts out of the quantum potentialities .",
    "of course , if we want to quantize the whole universe , there is no place for a classical domain outside it , and the copenhaguen interpretation can not be applied .",
    "some alternatives are the bohm - de broglie @xcite and the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite , where no classical domain is necessary to generate the physical facts out of potentialities .",
    "hence , they can be applied to the universe as a whole .    in ref.@xcite , it is argued that the wave packet solution of the wheeler - de witt equation corresponding to the quantized phantom scalar field model , which is peaked around the classical solution , spreads as one approaches the big rip region of configuration space , indicating the breakdown of the born - oppenheimer approximation and the absence of a wkb time .",
    "hence , the semiclassical approximation together with the notion of classical trajectories are not valid any more , and the classical singularity theorems do not apply : the big rip singularity is `` smoothed out '' due to quantum effects .",
    "there are two reasons which make this reasoning not conclusive .",
    "first of all , spreading of a gaussian does not necessarily mean that one is out of the classical region .",
    "for instance , a gaussian peaked around the classical trajectory @xmath0 describing a free quantum particle with momentum @xmath1 and mass @xmath2 spreads due to the increasing of the uncertainty on its position as time passes , approaching the classical statistical distribution of an ensemble of free particles with classical gaussian distribution of initial positions .",
    "in fact , there are many classical statistical distributions which spreads in time , hence spreading of distributions is not necessarily connected with quantum behaviour ( see ref.@xcite , chapter 6 , for a discussion on this subject ) .",
    "secondly , even assuming that a classical singularity has really been `` smoothed out '' by quantum effects , there is still the possibility of existence of some sort of singularity in the region of configuration space where the semiclassical approximation is not valid , even though it is rather obscure what should be a definition of a quantum spacetime singularity in this picture .",
    "these ambiguities are not present if one uses the bohm - de broglie interpretation of quantum cosmology . here",
    ", the classical domain is simply defined as the region in configuration space where the bohmian trajectories approach the classical ones , which happens when the wave function phase approaches the classical action or , equivalently , when the so called quantum potential becomes negligible . also , as in this interpretation one has a definite notion of trajectory in the classical and quantum domains , the singulatity may be defined straightforwardly , even at the quantum level .",
    "for instance , in a homogeneous and isotropic minisuperspace model , a bohmian scale factor trajectory can be calculated , and the big - bang singularity is defined as the finite proper time moment where the bohmian scale factor goes to zero .",
    "an illustrative example is the model described in ref.@xcite , where a singularity appears when quantum effects are present .",
    "the aim of this paper is to reexamine the investigation performed in ref.@xcite within the bohm - de broglie interpretation of quantum cosmology .",
    "we will show that , using this interpretation , the big rip singularity is not avoided in general : for a large class of wave solutions of the wheeler - dewitt equation it is still present , even though the wave function spreads in all cases .",
    "the paper is divided as follows : in the next section we describe the classical model where the big rip appears . in section 3",
    "we quantize the system and interpret the solutions using the bohm - de broglie interpretation of quantum cosmology , showing that within this interpretation the big rip is not always avoided .",
    "we end in section 4 with a discussion of the results and their significance , specially when compared with the results presented in ref.@xcite , and a conclusion .",
    "let us take the einstein - hilbert action minimally coupled to a scalar field @xmath3 , @xmath4 where , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the curvature scalar , @xmath8 is the determinant of the space metric , @xmath9 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature @xmath10 at the boundary @xmath11 of the four - dimensional manifold _",

    "we have shown in this paper that minisuperspace quantization of homogeneous and isotropic geometries with phantom scalar fields , when examined in the light of the bohm - de broglie interpretation of quantum mechanics , does not eliminate , in general , the classical big rip singularity .",
    "when examining gaussian superpositions of exact solutions of the wheeler - dewitt equation centered at different values of the hamilton - jacobi separation constant @xmath129 , one arrives at three possibilities : the big rip is completely eliminated when @xmath56 , it is a future attractor of all quantum expanding solutions when @xmath120 , and it can be either eliminated or a future attractor , depending on the initial conditions of each bohmian trajectory , when @xmath118 . as in the classical regime the big rip is a future attractor for all values of the separation constant @xmath52 , one concludes that , using the bohm - de broglie interpretation , the big rip singularity problem is alleviated but not solved by quantization .",
    "however , contrary to this conclusion , it is argued in ref.@xcite , using a different interpretation of the wave function , that the big rip singularity is completely eliminated ( `` smoothed out '' ) through quantization , and this result is independent of the separation constant @xmath52 .",
    "the reason for these different conclusions relies on the fact that all information one can get from the interpretation used in ref.@xcite comes from the amplitude of the wave function , whose qualitative behavior does not depend on @xmath52 , while the results obtained in the present paper , where the bohm - de broglie interpretation of quantum mechanics was used , there is crucial information also coming from the phase of the wave function ( its gradient ) , whose qualitative behavior does depend on @xmath52 .",
    "we are then faced with the very peculiar situation where different interpretations of the same quantum state of a system are predicting different physical facts , instead of just giving different descriptions of the same observable facts : indeed , there is nothing more observable than the fate of the whole universe .",
    "of course , even if the toy model analyzed here has something to do with the real universe , one should wait some tens of billion years to decide which conclusion is correct .",
    "we have explained in the introduction why we think the results of ref.@xcite are not conclusive , and how the notion of bohmian trajectories coming from the bohm - de broglie interpretation of quantum mechanics leads to well posed questions and answers concerning this subject .",
    "note , however , that the very notion of bohmian trajectories can be questioned with the argument that they are just artifacts , with no physical meaning .",
    "in fact , many objections against this notion have been presented @xcite , which were however properly answered in ref.@xcite . anyway , deciding between these two results seems to be rather premature at the moment .",
    "let us conclude with a last remark .",
    "we have seen that in quantum cosmology one may arrive at the peculiar situation where different interpretations of the same quantum state can lead to different physical facts , although testing the alternatives is completely out of question in this case . one interesting perspective for future work should be to find analog models in the laboratory based on this ( and perhaps others ) quantum cosmological model which present analog ambiguities in order to decide between interpretations .",
    "if it indeed turns to be possible in the future , it will be a result of ultimate importance for quantum mechanics , and for our whole physical picture of reality .",
