    "the ricci tensor @xmath14 is essentially the only possibility . in gravitation theory and cosmology ,",
    "the ricci tensor has the volume  decreasing effect ( i.e. , convergence of neighboring geodesics , see @xcite ) .",
    "] this equation roughly says that we can deform any metric on a 2surface or @xmath9manifold by the negative of its curvature ; after _ normalization _",
    "( see figure [ ricci ] ) , the final state of such deformation will be a metric with constant curvature .",
    "however , this is not true in general since , in addition to the presence of singularities , the limits could be ricci solitons ( see below ) .",
    "the factor of 2 in ( [ rf ] ) is more or less arbitrary , but the negative sign is essential to insure a kind of global _ volume exponential decay_,]for a positive function @xmath15 .",
    "we can get some insight into its solution from the simple exponential decay ode , @xmath16(where @xmath17 is the observed quantity with its initial value @xmath18 and @xmath19 is a positive decay constant ) , as well as the corresponding @xmath20th order rate equation ( where @xmath21 is an integer),@xmath22 ] since the ricci flow equation ( [ rf ] ) is a kind of nonlinear geometric generalization of the standard linear _ _ heat equation _",
    "_ @xmath23like the heat equation ( [ h1 ] ) , the ricci flow equation ( [ rf ] ) is well behaved in forward time and acts as a kind of smoothing operator ( but is usually impossible to solve in backward time ) .",

    "to some extent the ricci flow behaves similarly , so that the ricci curvature ` tries ' to become more uniform @xcite , thus resembling a monotonic _ entropy growth _ , of the metric @xmath13 is viewed as the leading quantity of the system and plays the role of a probability density , in perelman s entropy the leading quantity describing the system is the metric @xmath13 itself .",

    "the quadratic ricci flow equation ( [ rh ] ) is our geometric framework for general bio  reaction  diffusion systems , so that the spatio  temporal pde ( [ re - dif3d ] ) corresponds to the quadratic ricci flow pde @xmath35 with :    * the metric @xmath36 on an @xmath9manifold @xmath5 corresponding to the @xmath9dimensional ( or @xmath9component , or @xmath9phase ) concentration @xmath37 ; * the laplace ",

    "the ricci flow equation on @xmath42 reduces to @xmath47 thus the boundary sphere @xmath42 collapses to a point in finite time ( see milnor ) .",

    "suppose that we start with a compact initial 3manifold @xmath48 whose ricci tensor @xmath14 is everywhere positive definite .",
    "then , as @xmath48 shrinks to a point under the ricci flow ( [ rf ] ) , it becomes rounder and rounder .",
    "if we rescale the metric @xmath13 on @xmath48 so that the volume of @xmath48 remains constant , then @xmath48 converges towards another compact 3manifold @xmath49 of constant positive curvature ( see ham82 ) .    in case of even more general @xmath50manifolds ( outside the class of positive ricci curvature metrics ) ,",
    "the situation is much more complicated , as various singularities may arise .",
    "one way in which singularities may arise during the ricci flow is that a spherical boundary @xmath51 of an @xmath50manifold @xmath5 may collapse to a point in finite time .",
    "such collapses can be eliminated by performing a kind of ` geometric surgery ' on the 3manifold @xmath5 , that is a sophisticated sequence of cutting and pasting without accumulation of time errors ) with surgery is well understood , then one would be able to recognize the topological structure of the initial manifold .",
