    "in this paper we study a notion of complexity based on interaction among parts of a system .",
    "this is one of the first and most natural choices and has been considered several times .",
    "doing so , we will pursue a geometric approach going back to the works of amari @xcite . in statistical physics , for example , the complexity of a model is specified by the order of interaction .",
    "firstly , one considers the free theory with no interaction , and as the next approximation a theory of pair interaction .",
    "that means that there exists an energy function @xmath2 , assigning to each state of the world @xmath3 a real number @xmath4 such that the more probable states have a lower energy .",
    "if this function has , using a suitable expansion into polynomials , only terms of order two , one speaks of pair interaction .",
    "the probability to find the world in the state @xmath3 at temperature @xmath5 is given by the gibbs distribution @xmath6 where , @xmath0 denoting boltzmann s constant , @xmath7 is the inverse temperature @xmath8 .",
    "by @xmath9 we denoted the partition function , which is a normalization .    in this work ,",
    "we study a complexity measure that incorporates the idea to quantify the amount of pairwise , triple wise,  -interaction in a rigorous way .",
    "we do so by using the exponential families of @xmath0-interactions which will be defined in section [ sec : theory ] . in this context",
    ", a @xmath0-interaction is an interaction between @xmath0 random variables .",
    "they can stand for @xmath0 different particles in the spatial case , one variable in @xmath0 time steps , or a mixture of both . using the notion of distance from such an exponential family",
    ", we can quantify the amount of @xmath0-wise interaction that can not be explained by @xmath10-wise interaction .",
    "this allows us to quantify complexity .",
    "we explore this concept using two examples : symbolic dynamics of coupled map lattices and cellular automata . for coupled map lattices we focus on spatial interaction .",
    "still , the temporal and spatiotemporal features can be studied analogously as we will see for cellular automata .",
    "our approach quantifies all interactions in a system .",
    "it does not necessarily refer to any neighborhood structure , any possible subsystem can contribute to this interaction . allowing every subsystem , not necessarily local , to interact",
    "is motivated by possible applications as for example the identification of positions in the genome that carry a high information content .",
    "interacting regions in the genome are not necessarily located spatially close to each other .",
    "for example the arrangement of the chromosome in space can bring sequentially distant sites into spatial proximity and thereby enable regulatory interactions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sec : theory ] we introduce the necessary concepts from information theory and define our model systems .",
    "we give details on the models and numerical methods in section [ sec : simulation ] and in section [ sec : results ] we give the results .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] contains concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we introduce exponential families of probability measures , the kullback - leibler divergence and other notions . throughout the whole paper ,",
    "the set of states of the system is of compositional structure .",
    "that means , for each site index @xmath11 in a finite set @xmath12 we have a finite configuration space @xmath13 .",
    "the set of all possible configurations is @xmath14 and likewise for each subset @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "every real valued function on the set @xmath17 can be seen as an element of the vector space @xmath18 as @xmath19 is finite , this space is isomorphic to @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "we will therefore call elements in @xmath22 vectors or functions without preference .",
    "we now study probability distributions on the set @xmath17 . naturally , these are also elements of @xmath23 .",
    "consider @xmath24 the probability measures on the set @xmath17 . due to the compositional structure these probability measures are in fact only joint probabilities of a set of random variables @xmath25 , where @xmath26 takes values in @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath27 has the geometrical structure of a @xmath28-dimensional simplex . for @xmath29 ,",
    "we call @xmath30 the _ support _ of @xmath31 .",
    "then the probability distributions with full support are denoted @xmath32 the notation is justified as @xmath33 is the closure of @xmath34 .",
    "we consider the example @xmath35 in the binary case , i.e. @xmath36 .",
    "we have @xmath37 , and @xmath23 is just @xmath38 .",
    "the set of probability measures @xmath27 is a three - dimensional tetrahedron @xmath39 it is the set of joint probabilities of two binary random variables .",
    "the extreme points of this tetrahedron are the @xmath40 unit vectors .    for two distributions @xmath41 ,",
    "we can now define a notion of distance by @xmath42 here , @xmath43 is the condition @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 is called the _ kullback - leibler divergence _ or _ relative entropy_. although not a metric , it is non - negative and equals zero if and only if @xmath46 .    in information geometry one studies families of probability measures i.e. sub manifolds of @xmath27 .",
    "a very natural class of such families arises if we consider the exponential map @xmath47 it acts by component - wise exponentiation and normalization .",
    "let @xmath48 be a linear subspace of @xmath23 .",
    "we define the exponential family @xmath49 to be the image of @xmath48 under the exponential map : @xmath50    exponential families are well known in statistical science .",
    "they have many nice properties with respect to maximum likelihood estimation and other inference methods . for our application",
    "we are , for a given @xmath31 , interested in minimizing the distance @xmath51 for @xmath52 in a given exponential family .",
    "it can be seen , that this is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation of @xmath31 in the family @xmath53 .",
    "to do so , let @xmath54 be the relative frequencies of an observation .",
    "then the log - likelihood function with respect to @xmath52 is @xmath55 .",
    "maximum likelihood estimation is to find a @xmath52 that maximizes this function . on the other hand ,",
    "if we add to @xmath56 the constant ( with respect to @xmath52 ) @xmath57 we find @xmath58 therefore a maximizer of the likelihood is a minimizer of kullback - leibler distance . on the other hand , geometrically , minimization of @xmath45 could be interpreted as a projection , since @xmath59 is a kind of distance .",
    "this view is employed in information geometry .",
    "these projections are the key players in the definition of our complexity measure .    in what follows",
    ", we define the concrete exponential families that we will use in the definition of our measure .",
    "the idea that we want to follow was first explored by darroch et al .",
    "@xcite . it is to consider exponential families of @xmath0 interactions .",
    "firstly , one defines the linear space of functions depending on only @xmath0 of their arguments . after taking the exponential map of sums of such functions , we find probability distributions with only @xmath0-interactions . for a given probability distribution , coming from a real system ,",
    "we then want to quantify its complexity by measuring how far it is from being reducible to a theory of @xmath0-interactions .",
    "we exploit the compositional structure of @xmath17 to define the notion of @xmath0-th order interactions .    for any given @xmath15",
    ", we write @xmath60 as @xmath61 i.e.we distinguish between components in @xmath62 and outside @xmath62 .",
    "then we define @xmath63 to be the subspace of functions that do not depend on the configurations outside @xmath62 : @xmath64 using these spaces as building blocks , one can define the interaction space corresponding to interactions between @xmath0 arbitrary units @xmath65 i.e.just the span of all the vectors on the right hand side .",
    "associated with each of the interaction spaces is an exponential family @xmath66 .",
    "the interaction spaces are included in each other : @xmath67 , therefore we have defined a hierarchy of exponential families : @xmath68    this hierarchy was studied in @xcite .",
    "it has found various applications in the theory of neural networks .",
    "the correspondence with the notions of statistical physics is as follows : a vector @xmath69 corresponds to an energy which has only @xmath0-interactions , but no higher interactions .",
    "it gives rise to a probability distribution @xmath70 vice versa every @xmath31 in , for example , @xmath71 has a ( non - unique ) representation as @xmath72 where the energy can be written with pair interactions only .",
    "note that @xmath73 , corresponding to all functions , is @xmath74 . in general , in the image of the exponential map , one has only distributions with full support .",
    "probability zero corresponds to infinite energy which is only achievable by limits of sequences of probability measures in an exponential family .",
    "it is an open question which of the possible support sets are achievable by such limit probability measures in a given exponential family .",
    "this question is connected with the face structure of a convex polytope , the so called marginal polytope .",
    "see @xcite for details . for our application",
    "one can just pass to the closure(in @xmath75 ) of the exponential family . in practice , if @xmath54 is the distribution given by the relative frequencies observed in an experiment , we can compute the minimizer of the kullback - leibler distance to an exponential family using the iterative proportional fitting algorithm from @xcite",
    ". however , the complexity of the algorithm makes it unfeasible for values of @xmath76 .",
    "now we are about to introduce our complexity measures .",
    "they are based on the notion of distance to an exponential family @xmath53 .",
    "we define @xmath77 one can show that @xmath78 is continuous with respect to @xmath29 .",
    "given two exponential families @xmath79 on has @xmath80 we now use differences like these as components of a vector valued complexity measure .",
    "for a given @xmath81 , we define a vector valued complexity measure @xmath82 with components @xmath83 in the next section we will argue for the choice and discuss properties .",
    "the main idea is that @xmath84 quantifies those dependencies between @xmath0 nodes that are not captured by interactions between smaller subsets of nodes .",
    "however , this interpretation is a posteriori in the following sense : consider an open system , such as an infinite ca .",
    "although locally only pair interaction takes place , as the system evolves in time we find higher order correlations .",
    "when we speak of higher order interactions here , we mean an interpretation of higher correlations by a model of higher order interaction in a closed system .",
    "we look at examples for our quantities .",
    "consider first a distribution @xmath31 which factors over the units , i.e.it has a representation @xmath85 where @xmath86 are the marginals on single units .",
    "in this case @xmath31 is an element of the closure @xmath87 of the exponential family @xmath88 and therefore @xmath89 equals zero for @xmath90 .    for higher interactions a similar statement is true .",
    "one has that @xmath91 if @xmath31 admits a factorization as @xmath92 while here the converse is not true .",
    "a given @xmath93 need not have this structure . in the functions @xmath94 have the property to depend on their argument only through the part in @xmath62 : @xmath95 . in this general case ,",
    "the @xmath96 are not the marginals . if @xmath97 , then @xmath98 for @xmath99 .",
    "consider next a distribution in the synchronized case , i.e.from the value of one unit @xmath11 all the other units are determined .",
    "take as an example the distribution @xmath31 with @xmath100 and @xmath101 for all other elements .",
    "it can be seen that these distributions lie in the closure of @xmath71 , since , loosely speaking , by pair interactions this behavior can be explained .",
    "to do so let the second , third,  unit copy the value of the first unit , then the synchronized behavior is `` constructed '' using only conditions on pairs . since @xmath102 we have that @xmath103 for all @xmath104 and therefore the only non vanishing component of @xmath105 is @xmath106 .",
    "another extreme case is given by the parity function .",
    "let @xmath31 be the uniform distribution on the following set of elements @xmath107 @xmath108 is the set of all configurations with even parity .",
    "it can be seen that for this distribution @xmath109 is maximal while all other components vanish .",
    "this is due to the fact , that every choice of @xmath110 units in is independent under @xmath31 , while there is total ( functional ) dependence between all the @xmath111 units .",
    "it can be seen that even the reverse statement is true .",
    "we elaborate a bit on this .",
    "let @xmath112 be a binary function on the @xmath110-strings .",
    "define the following set @xmath113 this means that @xmath114 is formed by those strings where the nodes @xmath115 are chosen freely and the first node has the value of @xmath116 .",
    "let @xmath31 be the distribution that is uniform on the set @xmath117",
    ". then it can be shown that if @xmath118 then either @xmath116 is the parity function or @xmath119 is the parity function .",
    "the vector @xmath120 has a natural correspondence to multi - information ( or integration as it is termed in @xcite ) .",
    "multi - information is a generalization of mutual information and is defined as @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the entropy of @xmath31 and @xmath123 is the @xmath124-marginal of @xmath31 .",
    "then @xmath125 is the marginal entropy in the unit @xmath126 .",
    "multi - information measures the distance of a distribution from independence of the units .",
    "it allows a decomposition as @xmath127 see @xcite for these complexity measures , their properties , and the relation with tse complexity @xcite .    in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the maximizer of multi - information are contained in the closure of the exponential family @xmath71 and therefore have the @xmath120-vector concentrated in @xmath128 .    in the following",
    "we compare our approach with the one of @xcite . there",
    "the author distinguishes a chemical contrast , which corresponds to our @xmath129 .",
    "it quantifies the information that is contained in a sequence due to the average density of zeros differing from @xmath130 .",
    "then , quantities @xmath131 , the correlational contrasts , were defined .",
    "these are in fact conditional mutual information , which measure the difference of the actual distribution to a markov approximation .",
    "they also appear in the effective measure complexity @xcite which can be expressed as a weighted sum over these quantities .",
    "the relation to our measures is that @xmath132 implies @xmath133 .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that a distribution that has a markov property with respect to @xmath134 marginals will be representable by @xmath134 interactions . on the other hand ,",
    "a distribution that is representable by pair interactions does not necessarily admit a markov representation as the example @xmath135 of a triangle with no three - way interaction shows .",
    "therefore our measures give a finer view onto the interaction structure .",
    "having identified `` non complex '' behaviors with extreme values of the components of @xmath136 we now look for dynamical systems where @xmath120 is not concentrated in one component , because if several @xmath84 contribute , interactions on different scales coexist .",
    "this then could indicate complex behavior .",
    "we will next introduce our model systems where we try to find complex behavior in the above sense .",
    "a possible natural choice for a model system are one dimensional ( binary ) cellular automata .",
    "they produce discrete output and are therefore ideally suited for our method .",
    "furthermore , ca were introduced by s. wolfram@xcite as paradigmatic models to study complexity . in this work ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to some of the 256 elementary binary ca studied by wolfram @xcite . for these , starting from a configuration @xmath137 the next configuration @xmath138 at a site @xmath126",
    "is computed as @xmath139 for some function @xmath140 .",
    "typically one chooses periodic boundary conditions , i.e.@xmath141 is identified with @xmath142 .",
    "there exist exactly 256 functions @xmath143 , each characterized by its binary vector of values in @xmath144 .",
    "these vectors correspond to binary representations of integers smaller than 256 and the rules get numbered accordingly .    in this simple model , only the next neighbors of node @xmath126 influence this particular node .",
    "a priori , there are 88 elementary cas modulo the inversion and reflection symmetry . furthermore , there are trivial cases like rule 0 , etc",
    ". such that the number of `` interesting '' rules is smaller . in this paper",
    ", we pick out some specific rules that have found attention in the literature .",
    "specifically , we study the rules 18 , 20 , 22 , 30 , 45 , 50 , 90 , 110 , 126 and 150 .      our second model system : symbolic dynamics of coupled map lattices .",
    "let again @xmath145 denote the set of node indexes .",
    "assume we are given a connection structure between the nodes , specified by a graph @xmath146 with vertices @xmath147 .",
    "by abuse of notation , the structure of the network is given by the symmetric adjacency matrix @xmath148 of the graph .",
    "we study the discrete time case @xmath149 and every node @xmath150 carries a real value @xmath151 $ ] .",
    "these values get updated simultaneously according to the so called coupled tent map rule @xcite @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the number of neighbors of node @xmath11 and @xmath154 \\to [ 0,1]$ ] defined by @xmath155 is the tent map on the unit interval .",
    "tent map lattices are a well established model to study synchronization and pattern formation in spatially extended systems @xcite",
    ".    we will study binary symbolic dynamics of coupled tent map network @xcite .",
    "for each node we consider @xmath156 and for every @xmath15 we have @xmath157 as in section [ sec : theory ] .",
    "then the configuration space of the symbolic dynamics is @xmath158 , the space of binary sequences of length n. to every real valued dynamics @xmath159 of node @xmath126 , we consider the symbolic dynamics @xmath160 where @xmath161 $ ] is a given value .",
    "we obtain a global configuration of symbols @xmath162 .",
    "our aim is to utilize this symbolic time - series in order to evaluate the complexity of the full dynamics .",
    "assuming that a dynamical system has arrived in a stationary state it will produce a stationary distribution on the set of symbolic strings .",
    "the method we propose is to capture this stationary distribution @xmath31 and evaluate the complexity @xmath105 .",
    "we will call a dynamics complex if it exhibits interactions of different orders at the same time .        as our computational power limits us to analyzing short sequences , we cut pieces of length 14 from ca of length 20000 .",
    "these were iterated for @xmath163 time steps , starting from an i.i.d.initial condition . to gain more insight in the structure of our measures",
    "we furthermore evaluate it for the `` interaction cone '' corresponding to a single time step .",
    "to do so we take all binary strings of length 3 and compute the value of the ca on these strings .",
    "we then append the output as the 4th digit to the input string and compute @xmath164 on the uniform distribution on these strings .",
    "of course in the running ca one has to consider the influence of the stationary distribution on the inputs . to measure this influence we also evaluate the elementary 4-strings when the input is sampled with the stationary distribution .      to simulate the coupled map lattice one has to specify a graph . for our simulations ,",
    "we use a fully connected graph(``globally coupled network '' ) , and a circle graph ( `` next neighbor coupling '' ) of 10 nodes each .",
    "we initialize the networks by setting the @xmath165 to independently uniformly distributed random values in the real interval @xmath166 .",
    "the dynamics generates two time - series , the real valued one @xmath167 and , using @xmath168 , the symbolic one @xmath169 . in the uncoupled case ,",
    "the value @xmath170 gives the generating partition .",
    "it makes the symbolic time series most informative about the true time series .",
    "we discard the symbols during a transient time , assuming that after the transient time ( chosen here as @xmath163 time steps ) , the system is in a stationary state . treating the symbolic time - series as @xmath111 realizations of a random variable with probability distribution @xmath171 on the space of symbols we compute @xmath105 for this @xmath31 .",
    "we also experimented with different values of the bound @xmath172 , but it turned out that this does not change the qualitative behavior .",
    "the value @xmath173 has received some attention as synchronization of the real valued dynamics can be detected from the symbols @xcite .",
    "for our measures however , @xmath120 does not seem to depend on the choice of @xmath174 in such an essential manner .      as we have seen in section [ sec : famil - prob - meas ] , computing an information projections , i.e.a minimizer of @xmath45 , for @xmath31 given and @xmath175 can be written as computing a maximum likelihood estimation in some discrete statistical model .",
    "this estimation can be solved analytically only for some very simple models , such as @xmath176 .",
    "nevertheless , for the general case good iterative algorithms exist .",
    "these go back to kullback @xcite .",
    "we have reimplemented the algorithm in parallel in the program ` cipi ` which is freely available @xcite .",
    "as the projections can be computed , the determination of @xmath84 is merely a subtraction of two kl - divergences .",
    "in table [ tab : cellautres ] the experimental values for sequences of length 14 , cut from large cellular automata are given .",
    "then in tables [ tab : cellaut31uniform ] and [ tab : cellaut31specific ] the values of the @xmath120-vector for elementary steps of each of the automata are printed .",
    "we distinguish between the uniform input and the true input statistic sampled from the stationary distribution of the respective ca .",
    ".results for cellular automata , @xmath177 stands for a value less than @xmath178 .",
    "@xmath179 to @xmath180 are not shown , as they vanish . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the values in table [ tab : cellautres ] represent properties of the invariant measure of the respective ca .",
    "we confirm , that rules 30,45 , and 150 have the uniform distribution as their invariant measure , therefore no interaction can be detected .",
    "the results for rule 22 show , that the long range correlations , known from @xcite , can be detected using our measure .    in the elementary interaction cone of @xmath181 elements",
    ", we can observe the following principles : rule 18 and rule 20 build up correlations in the input which leads to overall stronger correlations when the stationary distribution is used .",
    "one can also see , that the outputs are not uniformly distributed leading to a high value of @xmath182 when the inputs are sampled from the stationary distribution . in the elementary time step of rule 22 a lot of triple",
    "wise interactions are detected .",
    "this property is also found when the inputs are sampled from the stationary distribution .",
    "rule 50 is a very simple rule which generates a periodic pattern of period 2 .",
    "we see this represented here as ( like in the synchronized case , described in the introduction ) the @xmath120-vector is concentrated in @xmath183 .",
    "when the inputs are uniform on the other hand , this rule has some small correlations of three positions , these get eliminated as the system reaches the stationary distribution .",
    "rule 90 and rule 150 are additive rules that are modeled by the xor function .",
    "rule 150 takes xor of every input , giving exactly the correlation between all 4 digits that was described in section [ sec : theory ] .",
    "rule 90 is similar , it computes xor of the inputs 1 and 3 , leading to only triple wise interaction .    for rules 22,30,45",
    "there is evidence for the long range correlations in @xcite . here , we can distinguish rule 22 from the other two , as rule 30 and rule 45 still show the uniform distribution in the outputs leading to @xmath182 being zero .",
    "rule 30 , stephen wolfram s `` all time favorite rule '' , is believed to have a high degree of randomness .",
    "( it might actually be used as a random number generator in ` mathematica ` ) . for us",
    "it is not distinguishable from rule 45 .",
    "rule 110 , which is capable of universal computation shows no specific behavior with respect to our measure .",
    "rule 126 has a mirror symmetry leading to @xmath106 being zero when the input is sampled uniformly .",
    "however , the stationary distribution induces a different symmetry .",
    "this leads to an interesting statistics , which looks as follows @xmath184 it can be seen that the rule exactly computes xor of input 1 and 3 on these configurations ( which it does not do on all configurations ) .",
    "this leads to the contribution of @xmath185 . on the other hand ,",
    "the nonexistence of the configurations @xmath186 and @xmath187 can only be accomplished by additional interactions of order 2 .",
    "a comparison with rule 90 shows the non - additive nature of @xmath120 .",
    "the exactness of the probabilities accounts for the exact values in @xmath120 .",
    "in fact these values can be predicted from theory .         for the fully connected graph(top ) , and the circle graph(bottom ) .",
    "note that the minima are attained in exactly the same parameter region , in which the @xmath84 have maxima.,title=\"fig:\",height=181 ]   for the fully connected graph(top ) , and the circle graph(bottom ) .",
    "note that the minima are attained in exactly the same parameter region , in which the @xmath84 have maxima.,title=\"fig:\",height=181 ]            in figures [ fig : full ] and [ fig : circle ] , the values of @xmath182 to @xmath188 are plotted for the fully connected and the circle graph , depending on the coupling @xmath189 . for @xmath190 ,",
    "the @xmath84 are very small and depend strongly on the random initial condition , so that we do nt evaluate them here .",
    "figure [ fig : lyapu ] shows the behavior of the largest lyapunov exponent for the two network structures .",
    "different snapshots of the symbolic dynamics of the circle graph are given in figures [ fig : snapshotdynamicscirc ] , [ fig : snapshotchaotic ] , and [ fig : snapshotcomplex ] .",
    "for the fully connected graph , the nodes will be driven to synchronized chaos if the coupling strength is high enough @xcite .",
    "we see this here as for @xmath191 @xmath120 is concentrated in @xmath128 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the @xmath84 indicate complex dynamics taking place on the edge of synchronized regimes .",
    "the largest lyapunov exponent becomes smallest at @xmath192 ( but not zero or negative , which would indicate periodicity ) .",
    "the respective maxima of the @xmath84 correspond to this .",
    "they are located at @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 .",
    "also note that @xmath197 has at least a local maximum at the parameter value @xmath198 .",
    "the circle graph of 10 nodes shows a specific `` nearly periodic '' behavior for parameter values @xmath199 $ ] . this is a specific feature due to the symmetry of the system .",
    "it is not present for @xmath200 .",
    "we do nt want to call the dynamics in that regime complex , as there is a high degree of regularity . in the respective parameter region ,",
    "the average activity taken over all nodes is almost constant . in the symbolic dynamics , 2 of the nodes are constant themselves , 4 are periodic , while the remaining 4 are close to periodicity(see figure [ fig : snapshotdynamicscirc ] ) .",
    "obviously , the complexity measures detect this phenomenon , as all @xmath201 drop to zero .",
    "more interestingly , when the parameter @xmath189 takes values close to where the regularity occurs we can observe very high values of the @xmath84 for @xmath202 . in this regime , the average activity does not follow the one of the individual nodes , but fluctuates on the same scale , instead of averaging out .",
    "this indicates a complex dynamical structure driven by higher order correlations among the nodes .",
    "see figure [ fig : snapshotcomplex ] for a snapshot of the dynamics . on the onset of the synchronization one can additionally observe `` part time synchronization '' .",
    "this means that a nearly periodic state , as described above , emerges , but is not stable .",
    "after a couple of time steps ( depending on the exact parameter value ) , it dissolves again .    to understand the reason for the peak close to the periodic phenomenon better we investigated the transition region closer .",
    "first , we took a very long sequence that shows transitions .",
    "then we separated the two phases , saving them to different files and analyzed them separately .",
    "the result here is , that the unordered state shows the same @xmath120 vector as the region left of the peak , while the periodic sequences of course have @xmath120 concentrated in @xmath106 , as the theory predicts .",
    "if the two types of sequences are mixed then higher order correlations appear , leading to the peak .",
    "this corresponds to the more general and unsolved problem whether the complexity of a convex combination of two distributions is related to the complexities of the individual constituents .",
    "we have introduced complexity measures , suggested by @xcite , that quantify the interactions of @xmath0 parts of a system that can not be explained by interaction between fewer parts of that system .",
    "then , after studying elementary theoretical properties and their interpretation , we have explored the measures in numerical studies . using the elementary cellular automata one can already study the behavior of the measures in special cases .",
    "there are specific effects , such as emergence of higher correlations , that can be found with our method .",
    "commonly studied quantities like correlation functions capture only part of what we called @xmath128 .",
    "our measures therefore give a more global view .",
    "symbolic dynamics of coupled map lattices are far less understood from a theoretical point of view .",
    "we have shown that using the symbolic dynamics one can detect important dynamical properties of the underlying real valued dynamics .",
    "this is true despite the fact that only spatial correlations are used in the computation of the @xmath84 .",
    "we stress the point that our measures take as input only the statistics of the system and make no model assumptions .",
    "they are suitable for exploratory analysis , as it is done in sequence based genetics . in an exploratory study one",
    "has no order parameters , as these quantities need to be constructed from some model first .",
    "interestingly , we observed that complex behavior takes place on the edge of synchronization , similar to the common wisdom of `` complex dynamics on the edge of chaos '' .",
    "@xmath128 plays a special role in this context . as synchronization phenomena",
    "are entirely captured by pair interactions , we would suggest to measure complexity in terms of @xmath84 for @xmath104 .",
    "there is more work to do , investigating this notion of complexity in different kinds of models .",
    "nevertheless the universality of the results remains to be investigated , as our system size is very small and the computation of the @xmath84 gets infeasible as the system grows .",
    "therefore , for the time being our approach is practically limited , while still conceptually appealing .                    , _ _ ,",
