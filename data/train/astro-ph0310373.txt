    "ngc6778 is a planetary nebula ( pn ) of excitation class 5 whose central star has zanstra temperatures between 4.5@xmath0  k ( h ) and 7.5@xmath0  k ( he ) ( preite - martinez & pottasch 1983 ) . no molecular material ( co or h@xmath1 ) has been detected in the nebula ( huggins et al .",
    "1996 ; kastner et al .   1996 ) .",
    "electron density and electron temperature are @xmath21700  @xmath3 and @xmath210500  k , respectively ( preite - martinez & pottasch 1983 ) .",
    "its distance is uncertain , ranging from 1.0 to 3.7 kpc ( see acker et al . , 1992 ) , with an averaged value of @xmath23  kpc .",
    "classified as a bipolar , filamentary pn by peimbert & torres - peimbert ( 1983 ) , the h@xmath4+[n  ii ] and [ o  iii ] images by schwarz , corradi & melnick ( 1992 ) show an elliptical nebula with hints of point - symmetric filaments .",
    "we have obtained narrow - band images and high resolution long - slit spectra of ngc6778 in order to analyze in detail its structure and kinematics . in this paper , we present the preliminary results of our investigation .",
    "narrow - band images of ngc6778 were obtained on 2002 june 24 with the 1.5 m telescope at observatorio de sierra nevada ( granada , spain ) . the nebula was observed through narrow - band filters centered in the h@xmath4 , [ n  ii ] @xmath56583 and [ o  iii ] @xmath55007 emission lines and in the continuum at @xmath56652  .",
    "the detector was a wright ccd with 820@xmath61152 pixels and an image scale of 038  pixel@xmath7 .",
    "exposure time ranged between 600  s and 1800  s. seeing was @xmath8 .",
    "long - slit echelle observations of ngc6778 were obtained on 2002 june 23 and 24 using the echelle spectrograph on the 4 m telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) .",
    "the spectrograph was used in the single - order , long - slit mode covering only the h@xmath4 and [ n  ii ] @xmath96548,6583 lines with a slit length of @xmath103@xmath11 .",
    "the data were recorded with the site 2k @xmath12 ccd , resulting in a spatial scale of @xmath13  pixel@xmath7 .",
    "the instrumental fwhm was @xmath108  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "the slit was oriented at position angles ( pas ) 15@xmath14 , 24@xmath14 , 47@xmath14 , and 100@xmath14 to cover the different morphological features of ngc6778 .",
    "integration times were 1200  s at each slit position .",
    "figure [ i m a ] presents the [ n  ii ] , h@xmath4 , [ o  iii ] images and [ n  ii]/h@xmath4 intensity ratio map of ngc6778 .",
    "the h@xmath4 and [ o  iii ] images show a bipolar pn of 20@xmath15 in size with its major axis oriented at pa@xmath1015@xmath14 , embedded in a faint elliptical structure detected in h@xmath4 with a size of @xmath16 .",
    "the nebular emission is dominated by a bright and knotty equatorial region of @xmath17 in size . in the light of [ n  ii ] , the emission is mostly confined to this equatorial region . very interestingly , two pairs of jet - like features are detected in this low - excitation line .",
    "one pair has linear morphology oriented along the main axis of the bipolar structure at pa@xmath1015@xmath14 and can be traced up to @xmath18 from the central star .",
    "the other pair presents an s - shape morphology between pa@xmath1015@xmath14 and @xmath1050@xmath14 and can be traced up to @xmath18 from the central star .    the [ n  ii]/h@xmath4 intensity ratio map ( fig .",
    "[ i m a ] ) shows that low - ionization material is concentrated around the equatorial region and in the jet - like features , while high - ionization material dominates the bipolar lobes .",
    "figure [ spe ] shows position - velocity maps of the four echellograms in the light of [ n  ii ] and h@xmath4 .",
    "the shapes of the emission lines in the position - velocity maps are compatible with a bipolar shell .",
    "the bright toroid observed in the direct images can be identified with the brightest knots detected in the spectra .",
    "if we assume circular cross - section for the toroid , its axis is tilted by @xmath19 with respect to the plane of the sky , as determined from its relative size along the major and minor axes of the nebula observed in the spectra .",
    "the jet - like features detected in the images are associated with high velocity features in the long - slit spectra ( fig .",
    "2 ) , confirming that they are collimated outflows .",
    "the radial velocity of the outflow at pa @xmath20 increases linearly with the distance to the central star from @xmath220  kms@xmath7 up to @xmath260  kms@xmath7 with respect to the systemic velocity of ngc6778 . assuming that this outflow shares the inclination of the bipolar shell , its ( maximum ) deprojected velocity is @xmath2230  kms@xmath7 . similarly , the radial velocity of the s - shaped outflow increases with the distance to the central star , with a maximum observed radial velocity of 100  kms@xmath7 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the collimated outflows seem to originate from bright knots at the tips of the bipolar shell , as it has already been observed in ngc6891 ( guerrero et al .",
    "the likely connection between the collimated outflows and nebular features suggests either that the shell has contributed to the collimation of the outflows or that the outflows have interacted and shocked material in the nebular shell .",
    "narrow - band images and long - slit echelle spectra indicate that ngc6778 is a bipolar pn with a very bright equatorial region .",
    "two pairs of collimated outflows have been detected in the object ; one is linear and oriented along the bipolar axis and the other one presents an s - shape morphology . the radial velocity in these outflows increases with the distance to the central star , reaching values up to 100 kms@xmath7 .",
    "the outflows seem to arise from bright knots at the tips of the bipolar shell suggesting that the shell has been involved in the collimation or that the outflows have interacted with the nebular shell .    * acknowledgments . *",
