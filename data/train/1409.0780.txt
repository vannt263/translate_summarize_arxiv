    "by shortly we refer to a time scale within which the sn ejecta will interact with gas originated from the earlier phases of the progenitors , e.g. , the ejected common envelope ( ce ) . by a long time",
    "we refer to a time when any mass lost from the progenitor has dispersed in the ism .",
    "the limit is not sharp , but it is typically @xmath24 .",
    "( b)_the double degenerate ( dd ) scenario _",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this scenario is based on the merger of two wds .",
    "however , this scenario does not specify the subsequent evolution , namely , how long after merger does the explosion of the remnant take place ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent papers , for example , discuss violent mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ) as possible channels of the dd scenario .",
    "this seems very problematic as it leads to a highly non - spherical supernova remnant ( snr ; @xcite ) , while @xcite find that snrs ia generally possess a spherical structure .",
    "others consider very long delays from merger to explosion , e.g. , because rapid rotation keeps the structure overstable @xcite .",
    "the upper limit on the size of the progenitor of sn  2011fe ( e.g. , @xcite ) implies that the exploding object was very compact , ruling out the presence of close gas .",
    "since the merger process ejects gas , the dd scenario is limited to have explosion at a time of @xmath25 after merger @xcite .",
    "as well , the production of manganese @xcite and nickel that requires exploding wds close to the chandrasekhar mass can be explained in the dd scenario if there is enough time for the merging wds to coalesce to a massive remnant .",
    "the dd and the cd scenarios can overlap in the sense that if the merger occurs after the termination of the ce phase , but while the core is not yet on the cooling track of a wd , both scenarios comprise the system .",
    "basically , the scenarios can overlap if the merger occurs during the planetary nebula phase of the system . however , there are two significant differences between the two scenarios . in the dd scenario",
    "the merger is of two cool wds , while in the cd scenario it is a wd with a hot core . in the dd scenario",
    "the delay to explosion is mainly due to gravitational waves emitted by the two wds ( e.g. , review by @xcite ) , while in the cd scenario it is due to angular momentum loss by the merger remnant @xcite .",
    "one significant difference between the two scenarios is that due to the long time scale of gravitational waves , no massive circumstellar matter ( csm ) is expected around the exploding star in the dd scenario . on the other hand , in the cd scenario",
    "a large fraction of sn ia will possess a csm that will influence the spectrum of the sn and/or the morphology of the snr .",
    "since in the cd scenario this csm was ionized at some time by the central wd remnant of the merger , it was a planetary nebula ( pn ) .",
    "such sne ia inside pne , or remnants of pne , are termed snips @xcite .",
    "( c)_the double - detonation ( ddet ) mechanism _",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) . here",
    "a sub - chandrasekhar mass wd accumulates a layer of helium - rich material coming from a donor .",
    "the helium layer is compressed as more material is accreted and detonates , leading to a second detonation near the center of the co wd ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there are two types of he wd companions : a wd of mass @xmath26 residing at @xmath27 from the exploding co wd @xcite , or a lighter , @xmath28 , wd at an orbital separation of @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the ddet scenario can account for only a small fraction of all sn ia , but @xcite found a much larger fraction that can be attributed to the sub - chandrasekhar ddet scenario .",
    "@xcite found that the explosion leads to a non - spherical snr , and in a case of a close helium wd , the latter will be ignited and will eject helium .",
    "as elaborated in @xcite , the expected snr has a dipole asymmetry that no well resolved snr ia has .",
    "for example , although sn1006 has a dipole asymmetry , @xcite find this dipole to be different from the one expected due to the effect of the he  wd companion on the ejecta in the ddet scenario .",
    "another problem with this scenario is that because the exploding co  wd almost does not grow before it explodes @xcite , it predicts that most exploding wds will have a mass of @xmath30 .",
    "this is in odd with recent findings that most sn ia masses are peaked around @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "@xcite also claim that at least @xmath32 of all sn ia come from near chandrasekhar mass ( @xmath33 ) wds .",
    "we conclude that the ddet scenario can lead to explosions similar to sn ia , but not to the common sn ia .",
    "( d)_the single degenerate ( sd ) scenario _",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this scenario a white dwarf ( wd ) accretes mass from a non - degenerate stellar companion and explodes when its mass reaches the chandrasekhar mass limit .",
    "the search for companions to sne ia came with null results ( e.g. @xcite ) and made this scenario very unlikely .",
    "another grave difficulty is that population synthesis studies find that the sd scenario can account for only a small fraction of sn ia ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we note that @xcite who included delay detonation due to wd spin - up , on the other hand , argue that the sd scenario can produce the required number of sne ia , and the observed delay time distribution .",
    "a very interesting set of observations is the detection of csm from hydrogen lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) and sodium absorption lines @xcite in some sn ia .",
    "these have been used to argue for the sd scenario ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite from hydrogen , and @xcite and @xcite from sodium ) .",
    "however , it seems that the csm mass inferred both from hydrogen , as in ptf  11kx @xcite , and from sodium absorption lines @xcite , is too large to be accounted for by the sd scenario . instead",
    ", @xcite and @xcite strongly argue that the cd scenario best accounts for these observations .",
    "\\(e ) _ the wd - wd collision scenario _",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this scenario two",
    "wds collide and immediately ignite .",
    "the collision is most likely induced by a tertiary star @xcite by the lidov - kozai mechanism @xcite . despite some attractive features of this scenario , it can account for at most few per cent of all sne ia @xcite .",
    "another problem is that the explosion in most cases is highly non - spherical , contradicting the observed morphology of most young close - by snrs .",
    "a third problem might be the delay time distribution ( dtd ) that behaves as @xmath14 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although the wd - wd collision scenario can lead to the observed @xmath14 dtd , it does so only at late times after star formation , @xmath34gyr according to @xcite .",
    "the fraction of systems that might be explained by the wd - wd collision is @xmath35 of all sn ia @xcite .",
    "based on the discussion above we consider the cd and dd scenarios as the most likely scenarios to account for most or all sn ia . in this paper",
    "we try to set a lower limit on the fraction of sn ia that come from the cd scenario by considering the influence of the csm on the sn spectra ( section [ sec : sncsm ] ) and on the morphology of snrs ( section [ sec : snr ] ) .",
    "our short summary is in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "@xcite find that @xmath36 of sn ia in star - forming galaxies exhibit time - variable sodium features associated with circumstellar material .",
    "@xcite obtain a similar result , showing that @xmath0 of sne ia possess blueshifted narrow na  i  d absorption features compared to non - blueshifted na  i  d features .    some papers ( e.g. , @xcite ) attributed the na  i  d absorption lines to a wind from a giant star in the sd scenario .",
    "however , it seems that the csm that supplies the sodium is too massive to be accounted for in the sd scenario @xcite .",
    "instead , @xcite suggested that the sodium comes from dust in a @xmath37 shell .",
    "this na - from - dust absorption ( nada ) model better fits the cd scenario where the shell is the mass that was ejected in the common envelope ( ce ) process ( assuming it is not ism ) .    for absorption lines to appear , the csm should reside along the line of sight . since in many cases the csm might not cover the entire sphere , the @xmath36 is a lower limit . on the other hand , in some cases the absorbing gas might be of ism origin .",
    "overall , the study of @xcite , within the frame of the nada model , suggests that @xmath38 of sn ia have massive csm that qualifies them as snip candidates .",
    "we note that @xcite , in the frame of the ddet scenario , and @xcite , within the frame of the dd scenario , have also attempted to explain the presence of csm around some sne ia .",
    "the csm mass in these models is too low for the nada model @xcite , although can be sufficient for other explanations for the na absorption lines , e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "interestingly , all the sn ia that show time - variable sodium features reside in star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "this suggests that either the absorbing gas is of ism origin , as dense clouds are abundant in star forming galaxies , or that the progenitors of these systems are relatively massive stars , @xmath39 that evolve rapidly .",
    "we assume that the time - variable sodium features are due to csm as in that case the csm must reside relatively close to the exploding wd . in that case",
    "the positive correlation of variable absorption with star forming galaxies is compatible with the cd scenario @xcite .",
    "we note though that presently the studies of @xcite and @xcite can not be used to distinguish between ism and csm features for an individual sn @xcite .      in the last decade",
    "more and more sne ia have been claimed to interact with a dense csm ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we mention here two such sn ia , sn  2002ic and ptf  11kx .",
    "@xcite argued that the hydrogen lines in sn  2002ic can be explained by a few solar masses that have been lost by the progenitor shortly before the explosion , and attribute it to an agb companion in the frame of the sd scenario .",
    "@xcite attributed the massive csm to the ejection of a ce , where a wd companion merged with the hot core of a massive agb star ; a process that was later termed the cd scenario .",
    "the massive csm was very close , some mass as close as @xmath40 , to the sn origin when explosion occurred .",
    "sn ia ptf  11kx @xcite had narrow hydrogen lines and indications of interaction with a massive csm which started 59 days after the explosion .",
    "@xcite argued that the csm was formed by a giant companion to the exploding wd , as is the case in some channels of the sd scenario .",
    "they dismiss the merger scenario as suggested by @xcite on several grounds , e.g. , it can not account for several csm shells .",
    "@xcite argued to the contrary , and explained ptf  11kx in the frame of the cd scenario .",
    "in particular , @xcite estimated the csm mass within @xmath41 to be @xmath42 , much above what the sd scenario can supply .",
    "@xcite crudely estimate that the fraction of sne ia that exhibit prominent circumstellar interaction near maximum light , e.g. , sn  2002ic and ptf  11kx , is @xmath43 .",
    "as @xmath44@xmath45 sn ia occur per @xmath46 stars formed @xcite , the estimate of @xcite stands at @xmath47 sn ia with massive csm per @xmath48 stars formed .",
    "the monte carlo simulations of @xcite show that the frequency of these systems is consistent with the cd scenario .",
    "@xcite take the sn ia rate at short delay times of @xmath49myr ( what they term prompt ) to be constant .",
    "based on that , we take the probability for explosion after the termination of the ce to be constant with time up to few @xmath50 . in our modelling this rate is higher than that found by @xcite .",
    "namely , we find in this paper that the sn ia rate within about one million years of the ce phase is very high .",
    "for a constant probability per unit time to explode within hundreds of thousands of years after merger , the probability to explode is linear with the radius of the csm up to several , assuming the csm expands with a constant velocity of tens of @xmath51 .",
    "namely , the probability for the system to explode by the time the csm reached a radius of @xmath52 ( as is the case for the na absorbing gas , ) is @xmath53 times that of a system where the csm only reached a radius of @xmath54 , as is the case of the sn ia - csm systems .",
    "therefore , the @xmath55 estimate by @xcite for cases where the csm is close to the exploding site , translates to few @xmath56 of snips ( where the csm is at @xmath52 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the estimate from the na absorption lines discussed in section [ subsec : sodium ] .",
    "out of a dozen of resolved sn ia remnants , at least a few may be attributed to sn ia that exploded inside a csm shell . for kepler",
    "s snr , the interaction of the sn ia with the csm is established @xcite .",
    "our previous work on this snr @xcite suggests that kepler s sn exploded inside a csm shell that originated as a pn .",
    "we term this scenario sn ia inside pn , or snip . in a recent work",
    ", we examined snr  g1.9 + 0.3 @xcite and suggested that its observed x - ray morphology also hints at a snip origin .",
    "examining the x - ray and radio snr images in the chandra snr catalogue @xcite , we try to identify other snrs that might have evidence for snip origin . as an indication for a possible snip origin",
    "we take here the morphological feature of two opposite ears in the snr ( nomenclature by @xcite ) , a feature both kepler and g1.9 + 0.3 have . on the one hand",
    "some ` ears ' might originate in ism interaction rather than csm . on the other hand",
    "some snips might contain no ` ears ' at all .",
    "as well , we do nt consider the possibility of forming the ears by jets blown by the merging wd and the core ( see @xcite ) , although it exists .",
    "for the preliminary estimates of the present study we consider our approach to be adequate .",
    "we focus only on close - by snrs that have a significant apparent angular size , and are well - resolved to an extent that allows to identify or disprove the existence of two opposite ears in the snr morphology .",
    "all of the sne in our sample are dynamically young , with estimated ages of less than @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "in other words , we only examine snrs ia that have clearly resolved sharp images that can show relatively detailed filaments structure in the snr shell .",
    "very old snrs that have been significantly influenced by ism interaction are not considered .",
    "though these criteria limit us to snrs in our immediate neighborhood ( the galaxy and the magellanic clouds ; mcs ) , we assume that this is a fair representative of other star - forming galaxies .",
    "we have identified a total of 13 snrs that comply with our criteria and list them in table [ table : snrs ] . in kepler s snr and snr  g1.9",
    "+ 0.3 , and possibly snrs dem  l71 , g299.2 - 2.9 , 0534 - 69.9 and 0519 - 69.0 , we identify opposite ears structures .",
    "we define the opposite ears structure as two protrusions from the overall spherical shape of an snr , directly opposite one to another .",
    "the protrusions have width of the order of roughly one tenth of the radius of the snr so that they can be easily identified by eye .",
    "no other similar protrusions beside these two should be present for a positive identification .",
    "these snrs are marked as having ears ( `` yes '' ) in table [ table : snrs ] .",
    "some snrs have such protrusions , but they are less proclaimed or the image is not sharp enough to determine if there are indeed opposite ears .",
    "these snrs are marked as possibly having ears ( `` maybe '' ) in table [ table : snrs ] .",
    "we already performed hydrodynamical simulations to explain the first two snrs as snips .",
    "the study of snr  g299.2 - 2.9 is a goal of a future work .    from the listed snrs ia in the table we derive an initial estimate of @xmath58 of well - resolved snrs ia possessing the opposite - ears morphology .",
    "in estimating the snip fraction other uncertainties should be considered . first , other scenarios can also create opposite ears , lowering the number of snip out of the snrs ia having opposite ears .",
    "such scenarios include dynamical interaction with the ism , in which small randomly positioned protrusions can be created by instabilities in the ejecta @xcite , and jets blown during the merger process @xcite .",
    "another speculative possibility that we raise here is an asymmetric explosion with jets along a symmetry axis that can give rise to opposite ears when the jets interact with the ism .",
    "we also note that detecting ears in snrs can be a function of viewing angle . in @xcite",
    "we estimated that the probability to observe the ears features in kepler s snr is roughly @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , some of the snrs that we identified as not having ears in our sample might in fact be snips , but with the ears projected in front and behind the snr itself .",
    "this introduces an additional uncertainty to our crude estimate , lowering the number of sn ia identified as snip candidates .",
    "another source of uncertainties is the usage of an x - ray catalogue , that might be biased toward sne ia exploding in dense ism and/or within a csm .",
    "if a sn ia occurs in a very low density ism and there is no csm , then the x - ray emission that results from the ejecta interaction with the surrounding gas will be very weak .",
    "we might miss non - interaction sn ia .",
    "this is likely to be the case with sn ia in the halo of the galaxy .",
    "overall the uncertainties are large , and our estimate of the fraction of snip candidates in well resolved snrs ia being approximately @xmath60 is only a crude upper limit .",
    "the resolved snrs are all located in the star - forming milky way galaxy and lmc .",
    "@xcite showed that star - forming galaxies have a mass - normalized sn ia rate of @xmath61 snum @xmath62 , while passive galaxies ( with no recent star formation ) have a lower rate of @xmath63 snum .",
    "our proposed snip scenario is expected to occur in systems that explode through the cd channel ( see section [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "this will predominantly occur in star - forming galaxies .",
    "@xcite show that @xmath64 of the stellar mass in galaxies having a stellar mass of @xmath65 in our local universe ( @xmath66 ) resides within elliptical ( passive ) galaxies .",
    "assuming that no snips occur in passive galaxies , and taking into account the mass - normalized sn ia rates above @xcite , and the mass fraction in elliptical galaxies of @xmath67 , we find that @xmath68 of sn ia occur in star forming galaxies . with our estimate from table [ table : snrs ] of @xmath60 being snips in star forming galaxies , we arrive to estimate that approximately @xmath69 of all sne ia may be snips by the opposite - ears criterion .",

    "the two wds might not merge because the agb envelope is not massive enough .",
    "the envelope is then ejected before merger . in such systems , according to the scenario discussed here , the two wds mass is close or over the chandrasekhar mass , and the pn contains `` ears '' , i.e. , small lobes .",
    "we are aware of two pne that have been claimed to host such a wd binary system , and these indeed have `` ears '' .",
    "nova v458 has a binary system at the center , with a very short orbital period of @xmath71 , consisting of a relatively massive wd ( @xmath72 ) and a secondary post - agb star ( @xmath73 ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is an elongated pn that has two opposite lobes @xcite .",
    "the gravitational wave inspiral time for this binary is @xmath74 , making it too long for a snip explosion to take place , but not by far .",

    "these two systems , we argue , support our snip scenario .",
    "they belong to systems just outside the boundary of the parameter space of the cd scenario where merger has been barely prevented , most likely due to a too low agb envelope mass . many others wd - core systems with a total mass close to the chandrasekhar mass merged at the end of the ce phase and formed snips .",
    "in this work we estimated the fraction of sne ia exploding inside pne ( snips ) , using three independent calculations .",

    "the results suggest that @xmath76 of sn ia possess massive csm and thus can be potentially qualified as snips . @xmath3 an estimation of the probability for sn ia explosion that will have a massive hydrogen csm , based on @xcite and described in section [ subsec : hcsm ] .",

    "considering the star - forming nature of the galaxy and the lmc , and taking into account the mass - normalized sn ia rates for star - forming and passive galaxies , this estimate translates to a fraction of @xmath79 of all sne ia having snip origin , as a crude upper limit .",
    "it is not clear yet whether the core - degenerate ( cd ) scenario can account for all sn ia and whether it can reproduce the dtd ( for two opposite views see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , it seems quite secure that the cd scenario can explain the large fraction of sn ia occurring shortly after star formation , i.e. , within @xmath80 , i.e. , shortly after the two massive stars of a binary system end their evolution on the agb @xcite .",
    "some studies argued for a very small contribution of the cd scenario .",
    "we attribute their results to two inaccurately treated processes .",
    "first is the mass transfer from the more massive star during its rgb and/or agb phases to the still main - sequence companion .",
    "@xcite pointed out , based on the code used by @xcite , that the transferred mass should be higher than usually assumed in population synthesis studies .",
    "the second inaccurately treated process is the ce ejection , which is too `` optimistic '' ( in the sense that the common envelope is assumed to be easily ejected ) in some population synthesis studies , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we note that @xcite argue that the cd scenario can not account for the csm they find in their study .",
    "we strongly disagree with that conclusion . despite the difficulties and open questions listed in table [ tab : table1 ] , we suggest that the cd scenario is the most likely scenario out of the 5 listed there to account for all the properties of the csm ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    our results , as well as other papers cited here , e.g. , that the sd scenario contribution to sn ia is at best very small , suggest that the focus in the open questions of sn ia progenitors should be shifted from the sd scenario to other scenarios .",
    "our view , as summarized in the last row of table [ tab : table1 ] , is that the two main sn ia channels are the dd and cd scenarios .    though we could only propose crude estimates that still demand a deeper and more thorough analysis , we are confident in the conclusion that a significant fraction ( at least @xmath81 , and possibly more ) of sne ia are snips , most likely formed through the cd scenario .",
