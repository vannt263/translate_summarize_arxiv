    "they pointed out that the transverse - momentum dependence in both the numerator and the denominator of the hard - scattering amplitude are of the same importance and should be considered consistently .",
    "similar improved treatment has also been done in refs.@xcite .",
    "it was shown that pqcd can give the correct prediction for the pion - photon transition form factor that is consistent with the present experimental data by keeping the @xmath19-dependence in both the hard - scattering amplitude and the pion wavefunction and by properly choosing of the pion wavefunction .",

    "a similar discussion has been done in ref.@xcite for the pion - photon transition form factor .",
    "these references tell us that one should take into account the higher fock states contributions as @xmath33  gev@xmath23 .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that the expression ( [ fflead ] ) gives half contribution to @xmath34 as one extends it to @xmath35  @xcite .",

    "furthermore , we can learn more information of the leading twist-2 da from the present cleo data , since the pion - photon transition form factor in the simplest exclusive process only involves one pion and the contributions from the higher twist structures and higher helicity states are highly suppressed ( at least by @xmath39 ) in comparison to the leading twist-2 pion wavefunction . in the present paper",
    ", we will not include the nlo contribution into our formulae . since we need a full nlo result in order to be consistent with our present calculation technique , in which the effects caused by the transverse - momentum dependence in the hard - scattering amplitude and the pion wavefunction and by the sudakov factor should be fully considered",

    "some further discussion and comments are made in sec.iv .",
    "the last section is reserved for a summary .",
    "first , we give a brief review of the lc formalism  @xcite .",
    "the lc formalism provides a convenient framework for the relativistic description of hadrons in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom and for the application of pqcd to exclusive processes .",
    "the lc fock - state expansion of wavefunction provides a precise definition of the parton model and a general method to calculate the hadronic matrix element . as for the pion wavefunction ,",
    "its fock - state expansion is @xmath40 where the fock - state wavefunctions @xmath41 @xmath42 satisfy the normalization condition @xmath43_n|\\psi_{n}(x_i,\\mathbf{k}_{\\perp i},\\lambda_i)|^2=1 , \\ ] ] with @xmath44_n=16\\pi^3 \\delta(1-\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i ) \\delta^2(\\sum_{i=1}^n\\mathbf{k}_{\\perp",

    "@xmath45 is the helicity of the constituents and @xmath46 stands for all fock states , e.g. @xmath47 .",
    "it should be pointed out that we have @xmath48_2 \\sum_{\\lambda_i }    leading fock state .",
    "the pion - photon transition form factor is connected with the @xmath49 vertex in the amplitude of @xmath50 as @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the momenta of the incident pion and the virtual photon respectively , and @xmath54 is the polarization vector of the final on - shell photon . to simplify the hard - scattering amplitude , we adopt the drell - yan - west assignment at the ` infinite - momentum ' frame  @xcite : @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is arbitrary because of lorentz invariance and it is taken to be @xmath58 for convenience .",
    "then @xmath59 is given by @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    ", where @xmath65 .",
    "the rightmost shaded oval with a slant pattern stands for the strong interactions.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    as illustrated in fig.([feyn ] ) , there are two basic types of contribution to @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath66 comes from fig.([feyn]a ) , which involves the direct annihilation of @xmath68-pair into two photons , i.e. the leading fock - state contribution that dominates the large @xmath1 contribution .",
    "@xmath67 comes from fig.([feyn]b ) , in which one photon coupling ` inside ' the pion wavefunction , i.e. strong interactions occur between the photon interactions that is related to the higher fock states contributions .",
    "an interpretation for @xmath67 can be given under the operator product expansion ( ope ) approach @xcite .",
    "under the ope approach @xcite , the nonperturbative aspects of the hadron dynamics are described by matrix elements of local operators . in particular , the longitudinal momentum distribution is related to the lowest - twist composite operators .",
    "while by taking into account the transverse - momentum effects , one needs to consider matrix elements of higher - twist composite operators in which some of the covariant derivatives appear in a contracted form like @xmath69 . by using the equation of motion for the light quark , @xmath70 , one can convert a two - body quark - antiquark operator @xmath71 into the `` three - body '' operator @xmath72 with an extra gluonic field @xmath73 being involved , which is just related to the higher fock state of pion .",
    "the first type of contribution @xmath74 stands for the conventional leading fock - state contribution . under the lc pqcd approach and by keeping the full @xmath75-dependence in both the hard - scattering amplitude and the wavefunction , the expression for @xmath74 is the one that is given in eqs.([fflead],[hardlead ] ) , where the terms involving the higher helicity states ( @xmath76 , @xmath45 stands for the corresponding helicity of the two constitute quarks of pion ) and the higher twist structures of the pion wavefunction are not explicitly written .",
    "since by direct calculating , one may observe that the contributions from the higher helicity states and the higher twist structures of the pion wavefunction are suppressed by at least @xmath39 to that of the usual helicity state @xmath77 of the leading fock state , which agrees with the discussion made in ref.@xcite .",
    "and then they can provide sizable contribution in the intermediate @xmath1 region @xcite . ]    as for the second type of contribution @xmath67 , it is difficult to be calculated in any @xmath1 region . if treating the photon vertex in fig.([feyn]b )",
    "as a vector meson dressed photon vertex , fig.([feyn]b ) can be calculated approximately under the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) approach , see e.g. ref.@xcite for a review and refs.@xcite for an explicit vmd calculation of the pion electro - magnetic form factor . by adopting the vmd approach to approximate fig.([feyn]b ) , one needs to introduce some undetermined coupling factor either for vmd1 or vmd2 formulation @xcite , which together with the undetermined parameters in the pion wavefunction can not be definitely determined by the cleo experimental data of the pion transition form factor only and some other constraints should also be taken into consideration , e.g. the constraint from the experimental value for the pion charge radius or the constraint from the experimental value for the pion electro - magnetic form factor .",
    "in fact , one usually takes the value of @xmath78 derived from the vmd approach to be in a simple monopole form  @xcite , i.e. @xmath79 $ ] , with the @xmath80-meson mass @xmath81 serves as a parameter determined by the pion charge radius . for the purpose of extracting some useful information of the pion wavefunction from the cleo experimental data ,",
    "we adopt the method raised by ref.@xcite to deal with @xmath67 .    as stated in ref.@xcite , around the region of @xmath82 , since the wavelength of the photon ` inside ' the pion wavefunction @xmath83",
    "is assumed to be much larger than the pion radius @xmath84 ( @xmath85 is some typical hadronic scale @xmath86  gev ) , we can treat such photon ( nearly on - shell ) as an external field which is approximately constant throughout the pion volume . and",
    "then , a fermion in a constant external field is modified only by a phase , i.e. @xmath87 .",
    "consequently , the lowest @xmath88-wavefunction for the pion is modified only by a phase @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the @xmath88-separation .",
    "transforming such phase into the momentum space and applying it to the wavefunction , the second contribution @xmath91 at @xmath92 can be simplified to @xmath93 \\int \\frac{d^2\\mathbf{k}_\\perp}{16\\pi^3}\\left\\{\\frac{(\\mathbf{k}_\\perp \\times\\mathbf{q}_\\perp)^2 } { ( x'\\mathbf{q}_\\perp+ \\mathbf{k}_\\perp)^2}\\left [ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_\\perp^2 } \\psi_{q\\bar{q}}(x,\\mathbf{k}_{\\perp } ) \\right ] + ( x\\leftrightarrow x')\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath25=dxdx'\\delta(1-x - x')$ ] and @xmath94 .",

    "it means that the leading contribution to @xmath34 as shown in eq.([fflead ] ) , which was given by keeping the @xmath19-corrections in both the hard - scattering amplitude and the pion wavefunction , can be equivalently obtained by setting the upper limit for the integral of the pion da to be @xmath113 $ ] .",
