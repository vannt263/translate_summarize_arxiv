    "the discovery of neutrino oscillations has marked a turning point in our understanding of nature and has brought neutrino physics to the center of attention of the particle , nuclear and astrophysics communities . here",
    "i summarize the determination of neutrino mass and mixing parameters in neutrino oscillation studies following ref .",
    "@xcite to which the reader is referred for details on data analysis and experimental references . for future neutrino oscillation projects",
    "see ref .",
    "the structure of the three - flavour lepton mixing matrix in various gauge theories of neutrino mass was given in  @xcite .",
    "current neutrino oscillation data are well described by its simplest unitary form , with is no sensitivity to cp violation .",
    "the effect of dirac cp phases in oscillations and majorana phases in constitute the main challenge for the future .",
    "the interpretation of the data requires good calculations of solar and atmospheric neutrino fluxes  @xcite , neutrino cross sections and experimental response functions , as well the inclusion of matter effects  @xcite in the sun and the earth .",
    "the solar neutrino data includes the rates of the chlorine experiment ( @xmath2  snu ) , the results of the gallium experiments sage ( @xmath3  snu ) and gallex / gno ( @xmath4  snu ) , as well as the 1496day super - k data ( 44 bins : 8 energy bins , 6 of which are further divided into 7 zenith angle bins ) .",
    "the sno data include the data from the salt phase in the form of the neutral current ( nc ) , charged current ( cc ) and elastic scattering ( es ) fluxes , the 2002 spectral day / night data ( 17 energy bins for each day and night period ) and the 391day data .",
    "the analysis includes not only the statistical errors , but also systematic uncertainties such as those of the eight solar neutrino fluxes .",
    "kamland detects reactor anti - neutrinos at the kamiokande site by the process @xmath5 , where the delayed coincidence of the prompt energy from the positron and a characteristic gamma from the neutron capture allows an efficient reduction of backgrounds .",
    "most of the incident @xmath6 s come from nuclear plants at distances of @xmath7 km from the detector , far enough to probe large mixing angle ( lma ) oscillations . to avoid large uncertainties associated with the geo - neutrino flux an energy cut at 2.6  mev prompt",
    "energy is applied for the oscillation analysis .",
    "the first kamland data correspond to a 162 ton - year exposure gave 54 anti - neutrino events in the final sample , after all cuts , while @xmath8 events are predicted for no oscillations with @xmath9 background events , consistent with the no  disappearance hypothesis at less than 0.05% probability .",
    "this gave the first evidence for the disappearance of reactor neutrinos before reaching the detector , and thus the first terrestrial confirmation of oscillations with @xmath10 .",
    "additional kamland data with a somewhat larger fiducial volume of the detector were presented at neutrino 2004 , corresponding to an 766.3  ton - year exposure . in total 258 events",
    "have been observed , versus @xmath11 reactor neutrino events expected in the case of no disappearance and @xmath12 background events .",
    "this leads to a confidence level of 99.995% for @xmath13 disappearance .",
    "moreover evidence for spectral distortion consistent with oscillations is obtained .    a very convenient way to bin the latest kamland data is in terms of @xmath14 , rather than the traditional bins of equal size in @xmath15 .",
    "various systematic errors associated to the neutrino fluxes , backgrounds , reactor fuel composition and individual reactor powers , small matter effects , and improved @xmath6 flux parameterization are included  @xcite .",
    "this singles out the lma solution from the previous `` zoo '' of alternatives  @xcite .",
    "the stronger evidence for spectral distortion in these data also leads to improved @xmath10 determination , substantially reducing the allowed region of oscillation parameters . from this point of view kamland",
    "has played a key role in the resolution of the solar neutrino problem .",
    "assuming cpt invariance one can directly compare the information obtained from solar neutrino experiments with the kamland reactor results .",
    "the first evidence for neutrino oscillations was the zenith angle dependence of the @xmath16-like atmospheric neutrino data from the super - k experiment in 1998 , an effect also seen in other atmospheric neutrino experiments .",
    "however , though appealing , the original oscillation interpretation was certainly not unique  @xcite . today , thanks to the accumulation of upgoing muon data , and the observation of the dip in the @xmath17 distribution of the atmospheric @xmath18 survival probability , the signature for atmospheric neutrino oscillations has become clear .",
    "the data include super - k charged - current atmospheric neutrino events , with the @xmath19-like and @xmath16-like data samples of sub- and multi - gev contained events grouped into 10 zenith - angle bins , with 5 angular bins of stopping muons and 10 through - going bins of up - going muons .",
    "we do not use @xmath20 appearance , multi - ring @xmath16 and neutral - current events , since an efficient monte - carlo simulation of these data would require further details of the super - k experiment , in particular of the way the neutral - current signal is extracted from the data .",
    "we employ the latest three  dimensional atmospheric neutrino fluxes given in  @xcite .",
    "@xmath18 disappearance over a long - baseline probing the same @xmath21 region relevant for atmospheric neutrinos is now available from the kek to kamioka ( k2k ) neutrino oscillation experiment .",
    "neutrinos produced by a 12  gev proton beam from the kek proton synchrotron consist of 98% muon neutrinos with a mean energy of 1.3  gev .",
    "the beam is controlled by a near detector 300  m away from the proton target .",
    "comparing these near detector data with the @xmath18 content of the beam observed by the super - k detector at a distance of 250  km gives information on neutrino oscillations .    the data k2k - i sample ( @xmath22 protons on target ) gave 56 events in super - k , whereas @xmath23 were expected for no oscillations .",
    "the k2k - ii data correspond to @xmath24 protons on target , comparable to the k2k - i sample .",
    "altogether they give 108 events in super - k , to be compared with @xmath25 expected for no oscillations . out of the 108 events 56",
    "are so - called single - ring muon events .",
    "this data sample contains mainly muon events from the quasi - elastic scattering @xmath26 , and the reconstructed energy is closely related to the true neutrino energy .",
    "the k2k collaboration finds that the observed spectrum is consistent with the one expected for no oscillation only at a probability of 0.11% , whereas the best fit oscillation hypothesis spectrum has a probability of 52% .",
    "one finds that the neutrino mass - squared difference inferred from the @xmath18 disappearance in k2k agrees with atmospheric neutrino results , providing the first confirmation of oscillations with @xmath27 with accelerator neutrinos .",
    "unfortunately in the current data sample k2k gives a rather weak constraint on the mixing angle , due to low statistics .",
    "however , although the determination of @xmath28 is completely dominated by atmospheric data , k2k data already start constraining the allowed @xmath27 region  @xcite . in particular",
    ", there is a constraint on @xmath27 from below , which is important for future long - baseline experiments , since these are drastically affected if @xmath27 lies in the lower part of the 3@xmath29 range indicated by current atmospheric data alone .",
    "the first systematic study of the effective lepton mixing matrix in gauge theories of massive neutrinos was given in  @xcite .",
    "for some models this matrix can be taken as approximately unitary . for three neutrinos , this gives @xmath30 where each factor is effectively @xmath31 and contains an angle and a cp phase .",
    "two of the three angles are involved in solar and atmospheric oscillations , so we set @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the last angle in the three ",
    "neutrino leptonic mixing matrix is @xmath34 , @xmath35 for which only an upper bound currently exists .",
    "all three phases are physical  @xcite , one corresponds to the one present in the quark sector ( dirac - phase ) and affects neutrino oscillations , while the other two are associated to the majorana nature of neutrinos and show up in neutrinoless double beta decay and other lepton - number violating processes , but not in conventional neutrino oscillations  @xcite .",
    "current neutrino oscillation experiments are insensitive to cp violation , thus we neglect all phases . in this approximation",
    "three - neutrino oscillations depend on the three mixing parameters @xmath36 and on the two mass - squared differences @xmath37 and @xmath38 characterizing solar and atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "the hierarchy @xmath39 implies that one can set , to a good approximation , @xmath40 in the analysis of atmospheric and k2k data , and @xmath27 to infinity in the analysis of solar and kamland data .",
    "apart from the data already mentioned , the global oscillation analysis also includes the constraints from the chooz and palo verde reactor experiments .",

    "however , including kamland-2004 the bound becomes comparable to the reactor bound .",
    "note also that , since the reactor bound on @xmath1 deteriorates quickly as @xmath27 decreases ( see fig .",

    "it is necessary to scrutize also the validity of the unitary approximation of the lepton mixing matrix in future experiments , given its theoretical fragility  @xcite .",
    "on general grounds neutrino masses are expected to be majorana  @xcite , a fact that may explain their relative smallness with respect to other fermion masses .",
    "neutrino oscillation data are insensitive to the absolute scale of neutrino masses and also to the fundamental issue of whether neutrinos are dirac or majorana particles  @xcite .",
    "hence the importance of neutrinoless double beta decay  @xcite .",
    "the significance of the decay is given by the fact that , in a gauge theory , irrespective of the mechanism that induces , it is bound to also yield a majorana neutrino mass  @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bbox ] .        quantitative implications of the `` black - box '' argument are model - dependent , but the theorem itself holds in any `` natural '' gauge theory .",
    "now that oscillations are experimentally confirmed we know that must be induced by the exchange of light majorana neutrinos .",
    "the corresponding amplitude is sensitive both to the absolute scale of neutrino mass as well as the two majorana cp phases that characterize the minimal 3-neutrino mixing matrix  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : nbbfut ] shows the estimated average mass parameter characterizing the neutrino exchange contribution to versus the lightest neutrino mass .",
    "the calculation takes into account the current neutrino oscillation parameters from @xcite and the nuclear matrix elements of  @xcite and compares with experimental sensitivities .",
    "the upper ( lower ) panel corresponds to the cases of normal ( inverted ) neutrino mass spectra . in these plots",
    "the `` diagonals '' correspond to the case of quasi - degenerate neutrinos  @xcite , which give the largest amplitude .",
    "in contrast to the normal hierarchy , where a destructive interference of neutrino amplitudes is possible , the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy implies a `` lower '' bound for the amplitude .",
    "an exception to the rule that there is no lower bound on in normal hierarchy models is provided by the model in @xcite .",
    "future experiments  @xcite will extend the sensitivity and provide an independent check of the heidelberg - moscow claim  @xcite .",
    "more information on the absolute scale of neutrino mass will also come from future beta decays searches  @xcite and cosmology  @xcite .",
    "neutrino mass arise from the dimension - five operator @xmath49 where @xmath50 the 1 higgs doublet and @xmath51 is a lepton doublet  @xcite .",
    "nothing is known from first principles about the mechanism that induces this operator , its associated mass scale or flavour structure .",
    "the neutrino masses that result from it once the electroweak symmetry breaks down are expected to be majorana .",
    "this may explain why neutrino masses are much smaller than those of the other fermions .",
    "this may happen either because the operator is suppressed by a large scale in the denominator , or else suppressed by a small scale in the numerator .",
    "both ways are viable and can be made natural .",
    "the most popular case is the seesaw mechanism which induces small neutrino masses from the exchange of heavy states that may come from unification .",

    "the effective triplet seesaw term has a flavor structure different from the type - i term , contributing to the lack of predictivity of seesaw schemes .",
    "an attempt to recover predicitvity within the seesaw approach by appealling to extra symmetries  @xcite is given in  @xcite .",
    "the model predicts maximal @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and naturally large @xmath54 , though unpredicted .",
    "moreover , if cp is violated @xmath34 becomes arbitrary but the dirac cp violation phase is maximal  @xcite .",
    "the model gives a lower bound on the absolute neutrino massd @xmath55 ev , requires a light slepton below 200 gev , and gives large rates for flavour violating processes .",
    "amongst `` bottom - up '' models we mention those where neutrino masses are given as radiative corrections  @xcite and models where low energy supersymmetry is the origin of neutrino mass  @xcite .",
    "the latter are based on the idea that r parity spontaneously break  @xcite , leading to a very simple effective bilinear r parity violation model  @xcite . in this case",
    "the neutrino spectrum is typically hierarchical , with the atmospheric scale generated at the tree level and the solar scale radiatively `` calculable ''  @xcite . for the parameters that reproduce the masses indicated by current data , typically the loghtest supersymmetric particle decays in the detector , and",

    "the nontrivial structure of charged and neutral current weak interactions with non - unitary lepton mixing matrix is a general feature of seesaw models  @xcite and lead to dimension-6 terms non - standard neutrino interactions ( nsi ) , as illustrated in fig .",

    "such sub - weak strength @xmath57 operators can be of two types : flavour - changing ( fc ) and non - universal ( nu ) .      in inverse",
    "seesaw - type models  @xcite the non - unitary piece of the lepton mixing matrix can be sizable and hence the induced nsi may be phenomenologically important  @xcite .",
    "sizable nsi strengths may also arise in radiative neutrino mass models and in supersymmetric unified models  @xcite .",
    "non - standard physics may in principle affect neutrino propagation properties and detection cross sections  @xcite . in their presence , the hamiltonian describing atmospheric neutrino propagation has , in addition to the standard oscillation part , another term @xmath58 @xmath59 here @xmath60 holds for neutrinos ( anti - neutrinos ) and @xmath61 and @xmath62 parameterize the nsi : @xmath63 is the forward scattering amplitude for the fc process @xmath64 and @xmath65 represents the difference between @xmath66 and @xmath67 elastic forward scattering . here",
    "@xmath68 is the number density of the fermion @xmath69 along the neutrino path . in the 2neutrino approximation ,",
    "the determination of atmospheric neutrino parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 was shown to be practically unaffected by the presence of nsi on down - type quarks ( @xmath70 )  @xcite .",
    "future neutrino factories will substantially improve this bound  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the oscillation interpretation of solar neutrino data is `` fragile '' in the presence of non - standard interactions  @xcite , with a new `` dark side '' solution ( with @xmath71  @xcite ) , essentially degenerate with the conventional one , present even after combining with data from reactors . on the other hand , it has been shown  @xcite that , even a small residual non - standard interaction of neutrinos in the @xmath72 channel leads to a drastic loss in sensitivity in the @xmath34 determination at a neutrino factory .",
