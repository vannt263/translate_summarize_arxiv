    "the so - called abc - effect , which constitutes a peculiar low - mass enhancement in the invariant mass of an isoscalar pion pair produced in a double - pionic fusion reaction , has been a puzzle all the time since its first discovery fifty years ago by abashian , booth and crowe @xcite .",
    "recent wasa - at - cosy experiments @xcite on the basic double - pionic fusion to deuterium established a tight correlation between the appearance of the abc effect and a narrow lorentzian energy dependence with mass m = 2.37 gev and width @xmath5 = 70 mev in the integral cross sections of the reactions @xmath0 and @xmath6 , isoscalar part .",
    "the differential distributions are consistent with a @xmath7 assignment to this resonance - like structure . in addition",
    "the experimental dalitz plots point to a @xmath8 excitation in the intermediate state .",
    "hence we consider the following reaction scenario for the interpretation of the data :    @xmath9    where r denotes a @xmath3-channel resonance in @xmath4 and @xmath8 systems . by this scenario",
    "we explictly neglect a possible direct decay @xmath10 .",
    "note that an intermediate @xmath11 configuration is excluded by isospin .",
    "in this paper we consider the possible decay channels of such a resonance in the scenario of eq .",
    "in particular we estimate the partial decay width into the elastic @xmath4 channel and calculate the effect of such a resonance onto the @xmath4 scattering observables .",
    "the cross section of the isoscalar two - body resonance process @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the initial center - of - mass momentum .",
    "with @xmath15 = 3 and @xmath16 = 1/2 the peak cross section at @xmath17 = 2.37 gev ( @xmath14 = 0.72 gev / c ) is then @xmath18 with @xmath19    since we also have    @xmath20    we get from ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) : @xmath21    to estimate @xmath22 consider the total cross sections of all channels , where the isoscalar @xmath8 system can decay into :    * \\(i ) @xmath23 and @xmath24 : + due to isospin rules we expect @xmath25 however , due to the isospin violation in the pion mass , the available phase space is somewhat smaller for charged pion production than for the production of the lighter neutral pions . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that this results in a resonance cross section , which is lower by about 20 @xmath26 in case of the @xmath24 channel .",
    "hence we have @xmath27 + the peak cross section of the @xmath0 reaction at @xmath28 = 2.37 gev has been measured to be 0.27 mb @xcite .",
    "this includes the contributions of the @xmath29-channel @xmath8 and roper excitations . accounting for this background effect",
    "the pure resonance cross section in this channel amounts to about 0.24 mb , _",
    "i.e. _ : @xmath30 * \\(ii ) @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 - only i = 0 part : + in a recent paper @xcite fldt and wilkin present an estimate of the resonance cross section in the @xmath34 reaction . according to their calculation based on final state interaction theory the expected peak cross section in the deuteron breakup channel @xmath35 is about 85@xmath26 that of the non - breakup channel @xmath23 , _ i.e. _ about 0.2 mb .",
    "very recently also albaladejo and oset @xcite estimated the expected resonance cross sections in @xmath34 and @xmath36 using a more elaborate theoretical procedure .",
    "their result for the @xmath34 channel is compatible with that from ref .",
    "+ next we consider the @xmath33 channel .",
    "though both the @xmath37 pair and the @xmath38 pair are isovector pairs , they may couple to @xmath39 in total .",
    "hence the isoscalar resonance may also decay into the isoscalar part of the @xmath33 channel .",
    "in fact , the decay of the resonance into the @xmath33 channel proceeds via the same intermediate @xmath40 system as the @xmath23 channel does . from isospin coupling",
    "we expect that the resonance decay into the @xmath33 system should be half that into the @xmath31 system . and since from the estimates in ref .",
    "@xcite we expect the resonance effect in the @xmath31 system to be about 0.20 mb , we estimate the peak resonance contribution in the @xmath33 system to be in the order of 0.1 mb .",
    "in fact , a recent measurement @xcite of this channel by wasa - at - cosy is in agreement with such a resonance contribution in the total cross section at @xmath28 = 2.37 gev .",
    "+ the resonance effect in the isoscalar part of the @xmath32 channel is composed of the configurations , where either both @xmath41 and @xmath42 pairs couple each to @xmath43 or both pairs each to @xmath44 .",
    "the latter case provides the same situation as the @xmath33 channel .",
    "hence we have + @xmath45 + we note that our estimate for the resonant @xmath36 cross section is in agreement with that of ref . @xcite .",
    "* \\(iii ) @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( i=0 part ) : + the isoscalar part of single - pion production is not well known .",
    "recent work @xcite suggests a maximum isoscalar cross section at @xmath28 = 2.30 gev with an indication of some steep decline thereafter . at our resonance energy there are no data at all .",
    "independent of this it is very hard to construct a process , where the intermediate @xmath8 system decays by emission of a single pion only .",
    "in such a case one of the @xmath48 excitations must be de - excited by pion exchange with the other @xmath48 .",
    "however , the formation of an intermediate @xmath11 state is isospin forbidden  as already mentioned in the introduction .",
    "also , the condition @xmath49 is very hard to fulfill in such a scenario .",
    "hence we conclude that any decay of the resonance r into these single - pion channels must be small compared to the favored decays into the two - pion channels .",
    "altogether we get as an estimate @xmath50 putting this into eq .",
    "( 6 ) and selecting the minus sign before the root we obtain @xmath51 which in turn corresponds to a resonance cross section in the elastic pn channel of only @xmath52 if the resonance would contribute only incoherently .    from the peak cross sections given under ( i ) and ( ii ) as well as from eqs .",

    "this is important , if we consider the resonance not only at its resonance mass  as done above  but also over a wider range of energies , as we will do now in the following .",
    "the momentum dependence is particularly significant for the numerator of the resonance amplitude , where the elastic decay width enters linearly and is highly momentum dependent due to the @xmath55- and @xmath56-wave character , respectively of the relevant partial waves .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we parameterize the elastic width due to the resonance excitation in the @xmath57l@xmath58 partial wave as follows : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the nucleon three - momenta in the rest - frame of the resonance at energies @xmath28 and @xmath62 , respectively . for the cutoff parameter we use @xmath63 = 0.5 gev / c@xmath64 .    in the exit channel",
    "the resonance decays into the @xmath8 system with a relative s - wave between the two @xmath48s  as observed in the @xmath48 angular distribution ( fig . 5 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore we have    @xmath65    where a monopole form - factor @xmath66    is introduced , in order to account for the abc effect ( see refs .",
    "the cutoff parameter @xmath67 is adjusted for best reproduction of the abc effect ( low - mass enhancement ) in the @xmath68 spectrum .",
    "since @xmath69 = @xmath70 , when neglecting the fermi motion of the nucleons , this form - factor is reflected directly in the @xmath68 spectrum and causes there the abc effect by suppression of the high - mass region .",
    "fitting the cutoff parameter @xmath67 of this monopole form - factor to the data in the @xmath68 spectrum results @xcite in @xmath71 corresponding to a length scale of @xmath72 2 fm .",
    "the total width of the resonance is then given by @xmath73 where the integral runs over all possible @xmath69 and @xmath74-invariant mass - squared @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) forming the systems @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the second term in eq .",
    "( 18 ) denotes the decays of the resonance via the intermediate @xmath8 system .",
    "the quantity @xmath79 contains the coupling constant @xmath80 and other constants and is fitted to yield a total width of @xmath81 = 70 mev .",
    "knowing now the partial decay width of the resonance r into the elastic @xmath4 channel we can calculate the resonance effect in this channel by adding the resonance amplitude to the corresponding partial wave amplitude of the energy dependent said solution .",
    "the scattering amplitude is given by the t - matrix elements for the @xmath82th partial wave , which are connected to those of the s - matrix by @xmath83 the s - matrix is parameterized usually in the stapp notation @xcite @xmath84    where @xmath85 denotes the real part of the phase shift in the @xmath82th partial wave and @xmath86 stands for its absorptive part , the inelasticity .",
    "for the full partial wave amplitude in the resonating partial waves @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively , we take the product s - matrix approach as used for the said analysis of @xmath89 scattering @xcite : @xmath90 where @xmath91 denotes the non - resonating background contribution , for which we take the current said sp07 solution .    by doing",
    "so we assume that    * the energy - dependent said solution is not affected significantly by use of the data in the resonance region @xmath92 = ( 1.0 - 1.3 ) gev .",
    "since differential cross section data - as we will demonstrate below - show an insignificant sensitivity to the resonance , the only data of relevance in this region are the analyzing power data at @xmath92 = 1.1 gev . in a global",
    "said analysis based on a multitude of data such a single data set is not expected to play a significant role .",
    "* the perturbation by the resonance amplitude is small , so that no severe problem with unitarity arises .",

    "it is largest in the analyzing power @xmath113 , which solely depends on interference terms .",
    "the resonance effects are particularly notable at intermediate angles , where the differential cross section gets smallest .",
    "we also see that @xmath87 and @xmath88 resonance contributions lead to opposite effects there .",
    "this provides the opportunity to disentangle these contributions by @xmath113 measurements .",
    "the decomposition of the @xmath41-scattering observables into partial wave amplitudes is given in ref .",
    "accordingly we have for the analyzing power :    @xmath117    with @xmath118 containing sums over partial wave amplitudes with total angular momenta @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "@xmath122 contains terms being proportional either to the legendre polynomials @xmath123 or to the associated ones @xmath124 . in @xmath125",
    "there are terms only proportional to @xmath123 and in @xmath126 only proportional to @xmath124 .",
    "in particular , the structure of @xmath126 for @xmath127 is as follows : @xmath128 p_3 ^ 1,\\ ] ] where the t - matrix elements contain the complex phase shifts .",
    "we see that a resonance effect in @xmath87 and @xmath88 enters with opposite sign and is proportional to @xmath129 in both cases .",
    "hence the resonance effect vanishes at the zeros of @xmath129 , which is the case at @xmath130 corresponding to @xmath131 and 116.6@xmath99 . at these angles the predictions with and without resonance in @xmath87 or @xmath88",
    "cross each other  see fig .  4 , top right .",
    "@xmath129 is maximal at @xmath132 and minimal at @xmath133 . since at the latter",
    "the differential cross section is minimal and much lower than at @xmath134  see fig .",
    "3 , left  , the resonance effect in @xmath113 gets maximal at @xmath135 , _",
    "i.e. _ at @xmath136 .    in fig .",
    "5 we plot the energy dependence of @xmath113 near @xmath137 , the angular region , where we find the largest resonance effects and where also a large amount of data are available , in particular from neutron - proton scattering experiments at saclay @xcite . since the angular dependence around @xmath137 is small , we plot in fig .  5 the energy dependence at @xmath138 , where the situation of available data @xcite is more favorable than at @xmath139 .",
    "the meaning of the drawn curves is the same as in fig .",
    "a significant resonance effect shows up within the energy region @xmath92 = ( 1.0 - 1.3 ) gev .",
    "the effect is opposite in sign for the resonance residing in @xmath87 or @xmath88 partial waves .",
    "note also that the calculations with ( dashed ) and without ( dash - dotted ) the constraint @xmath140 1 exhibit only small differences for energies below 1.1 gev ",
    "well within uncertainties of currently available data .",
    "this is not unexpected , since according to eqs .",
    "( 20 ) - ( 24 ) the analyzing power is mainly sensitive to the real part of the phase shift .",
    "summarizing , we have shown that the @xmath141 resonance structure found in the basic double - pionic fusion process @xmath0 is consistent with existing @xmath41 scattering data .",
    "the effect of such a @xmath3-channel resonance is significant in specific @xmath41 observables . in particular",
    "it improves considerably the description of the total cross section beyond 1 gev . among the differential",
    "observables the vector analyzing power exhibits the largest sensitivity to the resonance .",
    "however , for a crucial test of the resonance hypothesis and a meaningful separation of @xmath87 and @xmath88 resonance contributions high - precision data are needed for the energy region @xmath92 = ( 1.0 - 1.3 ) gev .",
    "such measurements have actually been carried out very recently with the wasa detector at cosy and the data analysis has started .",
    "the wasa detector installed at the cosy ring is particularly suited for analyzing power measurements in the intermediate angle region , which  as we have demonstrated here  is of main interest for the search of resonance effects in @xmath41 scattering .",
    "we finally note that on the issue of the @xmath141 resonance structure meanwhile a first three - body faddeev calculation with full relativistic kinematics and based on hadron dynamics has been carried out by gal and garzilaco @xcite .",
    "they find , indeed , a resonance with just these quantum numbers at a mass of 2.36(2 ) gev in agreement with the experimental observation .",
