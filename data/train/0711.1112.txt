    "non - abelian stringlike solutions have a long history which starts already in 1973 with the nielsen - olesen seminal paper @xcite .",
    "several general discussions were published @xcite and explicit solutions ( numerical of course ) were obtained @xcite for an @xmath3 gauge theory with higgs fields in the adjoint representation which completely break the symmetry .",
    "however , the major part of the activity in the field of cosmic strings @xcite was concentrated on their abelian counterparts .",
    "one reason for this is that these non - abelian string solutions have their flux directed in a fixed direction in the corresponding algebra so they are essentially abelian .    in recent years",
    ", new kinds of non - abelian strings were discovered during attempts to understand the phenomenon of confinement in qcd @xcite , and their properties were studied extensively @xcite .",
    "these new solutions appear in models with a global ( flavor ) @xmath5 symmetry in addition to the @xmath3 local ( color ) symmetry based on scalar fields in the fundamental representation .",
    "they allow rotation of the non - abelian flux in the lie algebra , which makes them genuinely non - abelian .",
    "when @xmath6 these consist a generalization @xcite of the _ semilocal _ strings introduced originally within the extended abelian higgs model @xcite which is the higgs system with a global @xmath7 symmetry in addition to the local @xmath4 .",
    "we therefore term the model discussed here the `` extended non - abelian higgs model '' .",
    "most of the studies of these non - abelian string solutions up to now have been limited to the self - dual ( bps ) case .",
    "however , it is natural to go further and look for more general solutions as has just been done very recently @xcite .",
    "this is the direction which we will take in this work , namely going beyond the bps limit and it will be done together with allowing also for the possibility of rotation ( i.e. spinning solutions ) and of currents along the string axis .",
    "spinning and superconducting cosmic strings have been found recently @xcite in the extended abelian higgs model which gives rise also to the ( embedded ) nielsen - olesen solutions .",
    "these new semilocal solutions , known as _ twisted _ , occur mainly outside the very peculiar ( self - dual ) limit of the coupling constants where the equations of the theory admit bogomolnyi conditions .",
    "another outstanding feature of twisted semilocal strings is that , when they exist , there is a continuous family of them , labelled by the `` twist '' , a parameter entering through a space - time dependent relative phase of the higgs field components .",
    "note however the existence of the electro - weak superconducting strings @xcite which exist without a `` twist '' .    in the abelian case ,",
    "the local string is characterized by a magnetic field concentrated in a tube along the symmetry axis . outside the core",
    "the magnetic field strength decays exponentially .",
    "the higgs field vanishes on the axis and reaches asymptotically its symmetry - breaking value .    for the twisted semilocal string the geometry is more involved .",
    "the magnetic and higgs fields behave roughly as for local string but the configuration supports in addition an azimuthal ( `` tangential '' ) component of the magnetic field .",
    "the source of this current is the additional higgs component ; its modulus is non - zero on the axis ( forming a condensate ) and vanishes outside the core and its phase is twisted .",
    "the effect of the non trivial phase can be appreciated once computing the gauge invariant noether currents and the magnetic field .",
    "figure [ magneticfield ] gives a pictorial representation of the effect of the twist .",
    "= 4.0 cm +    in this work we will present the non - abelian analogues of the abelian semilocal twisted strings and study their properties like current and angular momentum .",
    "untwisted purely magnetic local non - abelian strings will be discussed briefly as a special case .",
    "the field equations corresponding to the models presented here are non linear and coupled and do not admit explicit solutions .",
    "we therefore rely on numerical techniques to construct the solutions and calculate the physical quantities .",
    "several figures are necessary to illustrate the extreme richness of the solutions .",
    "the existence of these new kinds of strings raises the question of the nature of the gravitational fields of these strings and the possibility of new features in this respect .",
    "some initial work has been already done in this area @xcite  still for the bps case only and we will turn to that question in a future publication .",
    "another issue which is beyond the scope of this work is the effect of spin on the reconnection probability @xcite of non - abelian strings .",
    "this paper has the following plan . in section 2",
    "we present the extended non - abelian higgs model and discuss its relation with its abelian counterpart . in section 3 we derive the field equations and obtain the physical quantities which are used to characterize the solutions : energy , angular momentum , currents and charges . in section 4",
    "we present the various string solutions and discuss their properties across their parameter space .",
    "section 5 contains our conclusions .",
    "our general framework is based on a lagrangian describing a multiplet of @xmath0 scalar fields with local invariance under @xmath1 and a global invariance under @xmath5 .",
    "the local symmetry further requires @xmath8 non - abelian gauge fields and one abelian field .",
    "the scalar fields can be written in term of a matrix with elements @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 transforming according to @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are matrices in the fundamental representations of @xmath3 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "the lagrangian is : @xmath15 the standard definitions are used for the covariant derivative and gauge field strengths  : @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the structure constants of the gauge group and @xmath19 are the ( hermitian ) generators in the fundamental representation .",
    "we use the normalization @xmath20 .",
    "the most general renormalizable symmetry breaking potential is @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are positive constants .",
    "it can be written also as : @xmath25 the first term forces the scalar fields to develop a non - trivial minimum , while the second term forces the minimal configurations @xmath26 to be such that @xmath27 .",
    "this general system contains some well - known special cases , or seen from the other direction , may be considered as a generalization of several systems . from the point of view of the present discussion our model generalizes the extended abelian higgs model which corresponds to @xmath28 ( and @xmath29 , while @xmath0 is arbitrary ) in our terminology . in the abelian case ,",
    "the second term of the potential vanishes identically .",
    "this model allows for two kinds of stable string solutions as was first discovered @xcite for the case @xmath30 .",
    "the first is just the embedded abelian ( nielsen - olesen ) flux tube which in these circumstances is stable @xcite for @xmath31 .",
    "the second is sometimes called `` skyrmion '' because of the relation with the @xmath32-model lumps @xcite and exists only in the self - dual limit where the masses of the higgs and the gauge particles are equal ( or @xmath33 ) .",
    "its stability is guaranteed by a bogomolnyi - type argument .",
    "both solutions are termed semilocal strings and their discovery was a surprise at the time , since the vacuum manifold of the model is a @xmath34- dimensional sphere which does not give rise to non - contractible loops .",
    "this discovery gave an explicit example for a system where the non - triviality of the first homotopy group of the vacuum manifold is not a necessary condition for the existence of stable string - like solutions .",
    "in this system , the kinetic ( gradient ) term plays a crucial role since it has a lower symmetry than the potential term , and it is this `` mismatch '' between the different symmetries which enables the existence of these solutions @xcite .",
    "the two kinds of solutions mentioned above are static , but stationary spinning semilocal strings also exist in this system , as well as solutions which carry a persistent current .",
    "these solutions @xcite belong to a new family of solutions named _ twisted _ semilocal strings .",
    "the `` twist '' is realized by a relative phase between the two higgs field components , which changes along the string axis and may be also time dependent .",
    "these twisted strings exist for @xmath35 and form a continuous family parametrized by this `` twist '' parameter .",
    "the main physical property of these twisted strings is the current along the string axis which exists in both the static and stationary cases and gives rise to azimuthal component of the magnetic field .",
    "their energy in their rest frame decreases with growing current which implies that they are energetically more favorable to be produced during ( cosmological ) phase transitions than the embedded abelian strings .",
    "these new solutions bifurcate with the embedded abelian flux tubes in the limit of vanishing current , thus clarifying the nature of the `` magnetic spreading '' instability @xcite of the embedded abelian flux tubes for @xmath35 .",
    "we look for cylindrically symmetric non - abelian stringlike solutions and for definiteness , we limit ourselves to the case @xmath36 .",
    "but , the ansatz presented below and the corresponding equations can be generalized easily .    the electromagnetic potential and its non - abelian counterpart will be : @xmath37 where @xmath38 belongs to the cartan subalgebra of the gauge group . for @xmath7 there is only one possibility , i.e. @xmath39 but already for @xmath40 which is a rank 2 group there is more freedom and @xmath38 is a linear combination of the two ( commuting ) diagonal gell - mann matrices .",
    "we will denote the diagonal elements of @xmath38 by @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "for the scalar field we take : @xmath43 which follows ( and actually generalizes ) the form of @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the phases @xmath44 and @xmath45 will have linear dependence on @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 : @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    to write the field equations , it is convenient to use a dimensionless coordinate , to rescale the fields and `` phase parameters '' appropriately and to define a relative gauge coupling constant : @xmath51 with these dimensionless quantities , the field equations of the system are written below .",

    ", we have @xmath56 finally , for the non - abelian fields  : @xmath57    in order to obtain localized solutions , appropriate boundary conditions should be imposed .",
    "the boundary conditions will guarantee that the solutions will be regular on the axis @xmath58 and approach a vacuum for @xmath59 .",
    "regularity at @xmath58 yields @xmath60 while the requirement for asymptotic approach to the vacuum is somewhat more involved .",
    "for the scalar field we simply have @xmath61 which makes a clear distinction between the @xmath62 fields @xmath63 and the @xmath64 field .",
    "this last one will either trivially vanish , or have a unique behavior of starting at a non - vanishing central value and decreasing monotonically to zero .",
    "therefore , to avoid singularity at @xmath58 all the solutions discussed in the following will have @xmath65 .",
    "for the asymptotic behavior of the gauge fields we start by the observation that under a lorentz boost in the @xmath48 direction , the quantities @xmath66 transform as lorentz two - vectors . since we will consider in this paper only the case when these two vectors are spacelike ( corresponding to the magnetic case in the classification of @xcite ) , we can choose _ one _ of these two - vectors to be of the form @xmath67 without loosing generality .",
    "independently , one can perform residual gauge transformations of the form @xmath68 and assume in the following @xmath69 as for the azimuthal components of the gauge fields we have to impose @xmath70 these are @xmath62 equations for the two unknowns @xmath71 and @xmath72 , so the three magnetic numbers @xmath73 can not be independent . moreover , since they must be integers , not every @xmath38 in the cartan subalgebra is possible .",
    "a closed formula for these relations is rather complicated so we demonstrate this by two examples for the case @xmath74 where we can parametrize @xmath38 by : @xmath75 where @xmath76 are gell - mann matrices .",
    "for @xmath77 we have the relation @xmath78 and @xmath79 , while for @xmath80 we have @xmath81 and accordingly @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath71 however is given always by @xmath83 .",
    "the concrete solutions which we will present will be mainly with @xmath74 ( other values of @xmath62 can be treated similarly ) .      in this section ,",
    "we express several quantities which characterize the different types of solutions .",
    "the quantities are presented for string solutions of the extended non - abelian higgs model .",

    "( [ semilocalansatz ] ) , we get the following expressions for the global charge densities @xmath97 where we denote by @xmath98 the diagonal elements of the commuting flavor generators as we do for local symmetry . similarly for the current densities : @xmath99 accordingly , the charges and currents will be @xmath100 where the `` single field contributions '' @xmath101 and @xmath102 are defined in an obvious way . in terms of these",
    ", the angular momentum @xmath103 of the string can be written as @xmath104 .",
    "since the non - abelian charges all vanish due to the boundary conditions , these `` single field contributions '' are not independent but satisfy the following identities among the charges and currents @xmath105 these identities allow one to express two of the currents ( or charges ) in terms of the others . as a consequence , for an @xmath94 global symmetry",
    ", the @xmath62 diagonal global currents can be expressed in terms of @xmath106 independent ones .",
    "for example , for local @xmath7 and global @xmath40 , these relations lead to @xmath107 ; therefore @xmath108 by the left equation of ( [ sumchargesandcurrents ] ) and the two diagonal global currents are proportional to @xmath109 .    for local @xmath40 and the choice @xmath77",
    ", the global @xmath110 currents depend on two of the `` single field '' currents @xmath102 say , @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "actually two of them are just proportional to @xmath111 and @xmath112 and the third is a combination : @xmath113 these identities provide useful crosschecks of the numerical solutions discussed next .",
    "we solved the system of non - linear equations ( [ eqscalarsemilocal])-([ymeqssemilocal ] ) by using a numerical routine based on the collocation method @xcite .",
    "the solutions were constructed with grids involving typically 1000 points and with accuracy of the order of @xmath114 .",
    "the solutions we found are described in the following .      before discussing the semilocal strings",
    ", we pause to describe the simplest kind of non - abelian ones , namely the _ local _ non - abelian strings .",
    "they are obtained by truncating the general system to the case with @xmath115 so @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "this requires the further substitutions @xmath116 in the field equations above .",
    "= 10.0 cm +    inspection of the boundary conditions for the gauge fields as @xmath117 , reveals that in the gauge choice ( [ gaugeres ] ) all the parameters @xmath118 should vanish , leading to @xmath119 .",
    "so we solve equations ( [ eqscalarsemilocal])-([ymeqssemilocal ] ) with the above substitutions and with the following boundary conditions : @xmath120 the only stringlike solutions in this system are of the magnetic type , labelled by the integers @xmath73 which are consistent with the value we pick for the angle @xmath121 in the 3 - 8 plane of the cartan subalgebra .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the field profiles of a typical @xmath40 local string solutions with @xmath77 . the abelian flux is still quantized but is not an integer as can be easily seen from the figure .",
    "its value is 3/2 .",
    "similarly , the non - abelian flux is @xmath122 .",
    "now we return to the general case of the full system with @xmath123 , that is equations ( [ eqscalarsemilocal])-([ymeqssemilocal ] ) with non - vanishing @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the solutions have in general @xmath126 while we can still exploit the remaining symmetry to require again @xmath127 for @xmath128 .",

    "for @xmath205 all scalars are higgs - like fields which acquire asymptotically a non vanishing expectation value due to the potential . as a consequence",
    ", there is no place for a condensate and no twisted semilocal string are possible in this case .",
    "all those solutions were constructed by numerically solving the field equations with the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the solutions exist only on a non trivial domain of the parameter space of the possible solutions .",
    "we have tried to determine this domain qualitatively and obtained a lot of information about the pattern of the solutions .",
    "we demonstrated the bifurcation phenomenon which occurs in this case at a critical value of the twist @xmath143 which now depends on the various fluxes and on @xmath206 in addition to the parameters in the potential .    a crucial step for deciding the physical relevance of non - abelian twisted semilocal strings would be to study their stability by performing a systematic normal mode analysis , as was done recently @xcite for the extended abelian higgs model .",
    "another important issue is the understanding of the low - energy dynamics of the non - abelian twisted semilocal strings .",
    "this can be done e.g. by using the geodesic approximation of @xcite which is based on a parametrization of the zero modes in terms of collective coordinates . for untwisted local and semilocal strings ,",
    "this analysis is reported in details by aldrovandi ( see sec .",
    "vi of @xcite ) .",
    "since the phases of twisted semilocal strings depend on @xmath46 and @xmath48 , the parametrization of the orientational moduli in terms of slowly varying functions of these coordinates does not seem to be straightforward .",
    "the parametrization of the fluctuations used in @xcite might turn out to be very useful .",
    "we plan to address these questions in a further publication , as well as the gravitating counterparts of twisted strings .",
    "another direction is motivated by the non - abelian superconducting strings , recently obtained by volkov @xcite within the @xmath207 electroweak theory .",
    "these `` untwisted '' strings can be used as a starting point towards constructing twisted solutions which will be related to a non - abelian subgroup of the gauge group .    *",
