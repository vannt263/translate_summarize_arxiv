    "ever since the discovery of the rising @xmath6 and @xmath7 total cross sections in protvino @xcite , experimental data on hadronic total cross sections are among the most reliable tools for checking models of the pomeron .",
    "the so - called  enhanced  cuts were among the first theoretical ideas used to explain the phenomenon @xcite .",
    "since then , both the theory and experiment made enormous progress .",
    "apart from hadronic reactions , measured now at much higher energies , photon - induced reactions also confirm the universal rise of the total cross sections .",
    "empirical fits searching a universal pomeron fitting all of the existing data were made e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the simplest models as the contribution to the total cross sections can be classified in three groups :    the dipole pomeron : @xmath8 @xcite ;    the  froissart model  : @xmath9 @xcite ;    the  supercritical  pomeron : @xmath10 @xcite ( actually , the list of relevant references is much longer and we apologize to those omitted there ) .",
    "the last option , the supercritical one , in qcd corresponds to an infinite ladder of reggeized gluon exchange @xcite . at finite energies ,",
    "however only a finite number of diagrams contributes , giving rise to a finite series in logarithms of @xmath11 @xcite like @xmath12 respecting the froissart bound . in the language of regge - poles such a finite series corresponds to multipoles @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "an obvious way to generalize @xcite the donnachie - landshoff model @xcite is to add another constant , whenafter it becomes @xmath13 in ref .",
    "@xcite the model ( [ eq2 ] ) was interpreted as that corresponding to two pomeron poles .",
    "recently a detail analysis of three pomeron models , namely @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 was performed . besides the pomeron non - exchange - degenerate sub - leading contributions were included .",
    "the intercepts of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 regge trajectories were assumed to be different .",
    "the analysis @xcite is the most complete and professional one among those existing .",
    "it shows e.g. that the lowest energy , where the above parametrization works ( i.e. @xmath19 ) is @xmath20 @xmath21 .    in the present paper",
    "we continue the program initiated by @xcite by scrutinizing two more earlier unexplored models for the pomeron .",
    "we show that they do not require the secondary trajectories to be exchange - degenerate .",
    "this disputable point was recently raised also in ref .",
    "@xcite . as seen from fig .",
    "1 the 10 resonances belonging to the 4 different @xmath22 families @xmath23 are compatible with a unique linear exchange - degenerate regge trajectory with @xmath24 intercept .",
    "our procedure follows the paper @xcite as close as possible .",
    "firstly , we use the same data sample @xcite , secondly , we use the same number of free parameters ( namely , 16 ) , thirdly , we calculate the errors in the same way as the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite do .",
    "moreover , we use the same notation .",
    "this universality makes it possible to confront the resulting fits without any bias .",
    "let us write the real and imaginary parts of the forward elastic scattering amplitude as @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 ,   \\label{eq8}\\ ] ] @xmath28 comes from the pomeron contribution and @xmath29 s^{-\\eta } , \\label{eq10}\\ ] ] @xmath30 s^{-\\eta } ,   \\label{eq11}\\ ] ] corresponds to the contribution of two exchange - degenerate regge trajectories as in the classical paper of donnachie and landshoff @xcite .",
    "everybody is aware of the fact that exchange degeneracy is violated .",
    "the question is only the amount of this violation and the price to be paid for the introduction of additional free parameters .",
    "the quality of our fits show ( see below ) that exchange degeneracy is a reasonable approximation to reality .    we have fitted the above model to the data on total cross sections and the ratio of the real to imaginary part of @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 scattering , starting from @xmath37 until the highest available energies . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have studied the stability of our fit by varying the lower limit of the fit @xmath37 between @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xmath21 .",
    "the number of the experimental data points and the resulting fit ( value of @xmath40 ) as well as the dependence of the fitted parameters on the lower bound @xmath37 are presented in fig .",
    "2 .    the results of our fits basically are consistent with those of ref .",
    "the minor difference is in the limiting value @xmath19 , reached at @xmath41 @xmath21 in our fits ( instead of @xmath42 of ref .",
    "the difference obviously comes from exchange degeneracy of the subleading trajectories imposed here but relaxed in @xcite .",
    "the fits for the total cross sections and @xmath43-ratio ( for @xmath44 @xmath21 ) extrapolated to @xmath45 @xmath21 , are shown in fig .",
    "an important result of our fit is that the coefficients of the series ( [ eq1 ] ) have alternating signs ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this property and the rapid decrease of their absolute values ( as @xmath46 ) provides the fast convergence of the series and ensures the applicability of this approximation at still much higher energies .",
    "the physical motivation of such a finite series representation of the pomeron was discussed earlier - both in the context of regge multipoles @xcite and qcd @xcite .",
    "table 1 : values of the fitted parameters in the alternating series pomeron model    ( 6)-(11 ) , with a cut - off @xmath47 @xmath21 and @xmath48 @xmath49 fixed .",
    "the main virtue of the d - l model of the pomeron @xcite is its simplicity .",
    "although it the single - term ( factorizable ! ) d - l model ( appended by a nonleading term ) fits the data remarkably well @xcite , its possible extensions involving more free parameters are obvious and were discussed by various authors @xcite .",
    "one possibility is to add a constant term , resulting in the following expression for the pomeron contribution @xcite @xmath50 written as @xmath51 , \\label{eq13}\\ ] ] @xmath52 the model has the same number of free parameters as in the previous case ( section 2 ) or in ref .",
    "similar to the previous case , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) , the model is appended by a pair of exchange - degenerate sub - leading trajectories .",
    "the optimal value of @xmath19 , as in the previous case , is reached when @xmath41 @xmath21 .",
    "the resulting fits are shown in fig .",
    "the fits for the total cross sections and @xmath43- ratio for @xmath41 @xmath21 , extrapolated in the same way as for the previous case ( see section 2 ) , are shown in fig .",
